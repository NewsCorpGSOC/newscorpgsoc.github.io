China’s Sudden Live Fire Naval Drills Off Australia Rattle Canber...	A rare Chinese naval drill with a previously unannounced live-fire component has disrupted air traffic over and around the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand. Authorities in Australia say they only learned that the Chinese ships would be firing some of their weapons after the crews of commercial airliners flying overhead received alerts. In addition to the signals this particular incident sends, the general presence of the flotilla in the region underscores the increasing reach of a steadily larger and more capable People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) beyond China's own shores. The PLAN's Type 055 destroyer Zunyi, Type 054A frigate Hengyang, and Type 903 replenishment ship Weishanhu have been sailing south in international waters to the east of Australia since at least last week. Often referred to as a cruiser given its size, the Type 055 is one of the most modern and capable warships in Chinese service today. Elements of the Australian and New Zealand armed forces, including warships and P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol planes, have been shadowing their movements. A picture Australian authorities previously released of the Type 054A frigate Hengyang sailing waters to the east of the country. Australian Defense Force 'We weren't notified by China, we became aware of the issue during the course of the day,' Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles said while speaking to ABC Radio Perth earlier today. 'What China did was put out a notification that it was intending to engage in live fire, and by that I mean a broadcast that was picked up by airlines, literally commercial planes that were flying across the Tasman.' 'I can understand why this was probably … very disconcerting for the airlines,' Marles added, stressing that Australia typically gives 12 to 24 hours notice ahead of live-fire exercises. Based on information in alerts shared via the international Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS), the Chinese drills occurred in an area roughly 400 miles (340 nautical miles) to the southeast of the Australian city of Sydney. An Emirates flight heading from Sydney in Australia to New Zealand's Christchurch was reportedly directly hailed by the Chinese flotilla warning the aircraft to stay at least 19 nautical miles away from where they were operating. Qantas and Air New Zealand have now made changes to the routes their planes take over and around the Tasman Sea, and other airlines have reportedly done the same. Civilian aviation authorities in Australia have now issued formal 'advice' regarding air traffic around where the Chinese ships are operating.

'The ABC understands the Chinese vessels were seen deploying a floating target, changing formation and then resetting formation consistent with a live fire event,' according to that outlet. 'However, it is understood the Australian military did not observe the vessels firing on the target.' Inflatable floating targets, typically red or bright orange in color, and often referred to as 'killer tomatoes' as a result, are routinely used in maritime training exercises, especially live-fire gunnery drills, by armed forces around the world. Chinese sailors drop a 'killer tomato' target off the side of a ship during training in the South China Sea. China Military Online Whether the Chinese ships will conduct additional live-fire drills while they are in the Tasman Sea or elsewhere in the region is unknown. 'This is activity that has occurred in waters consistent with international law,' Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has said. 'There has been no imminent risk of danger to any Australian assets or New Zealand assets.' 'The [People's Liberation Army] Southern Theatre Command organized the Chinese fleet to conduct a far seas exercise,' Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry, said, according to ABC. 'The drill was carried out in a safe, standard, and professional manner in accordance with the relevant international law and international practice.' At the same time, the Chinese flotilla's actions today, as well as its general presence in the region, are clearly at best atypical. Prime Minister Albanese has already drawn criticism within Australia for his muted response. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, at the podium, and, to his left, Richard Marles, now Australia's Defense Minister, at a press conference in 2022. David Gray/Getty Images DAVID GRAY 'There is no doubt that this is, not unprecedented, but an unusual event,' Australian Defense Minister Marles had also told Sky News television yesterday just about the arrival of the Chinese ships in waters to the east of Australia. 'We have not been informed by the Chinese government why this task group has been deployed into our region, and we have not been informed what its future plans are,' New Zealand Defense Minister Judith Collins had said in a separate statement yesterday. Especially now with the disruptive live-firing that was not announced in advance, it is hard not to see the Chinese flotilla's operations as being intended to send a message at least to Australia, if not well beyond. Just five days ago, Australian and Chinese military officials held a high-level strategic dialogue in Beijing, the 23rd such engagement the two countries have held, but the first since 2019. 'At today’s Dialogue, both countries exchanged views on bilateral, global, and regional security issues, as well as military transparency and communication,' Australia's Department of Defense said in a statement after the February 17 gathering. 'Australia reiterated the importance of all countries in the region operating in a safe and professional manner at all times to avoid the risk of miscalculation or escalation.' There has been a general trend of increasingly assertive Chinese naval activity around Australia in recent years. For instance, in 2022, Australian authorities accused a Chinese warship sailing in waters to the north of Australia of harassing one of its P-8A aircraft with a laser. Chinese intelligence-gathering ships have become an increasingly common sight in international waters off Australia coasts, as well. A Royal Australian Air Force P-8A Poseidon. Australian Department of Defense There has been a similar trend in more aggressive Chinese military interactions with foreign warships and aircraft, especially in and around the hotly disputed South China Sea. Just earlier this month, a Chinese fighter jet dropped flares in front of another Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) P-8A flying over the South China China Sea in what officials in Australia described as an 'unsafe and unprofessional interaction.' Chinese state media has since released footage of this incident, as seen below.

The most prominent effort in this regard is the Royal Australian Navy's planned acquisition of a nuclear-powered submarine force with the assistance of its American and British allies. This is part of the larger trilateral Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS) defense cooperation agreement. The U.S. military's own forward-deployed air and naval presence in Australia is also set to grow significantly. For its part, China's military has steadily working to expand its ability to project naval and air power further and further away from its shores in all directions in the Pacific, as well as elsewhere globally. This includes a significant uptick in Chinese activity in the waters and skies around the U.S. state of Alaska, which has also often been conducted in direct cooperation with Russian forces. Chinese H-6 missile carrier aircraft notably made their first-ever appearance off Alaska last year as part of a joint patrol with Russian Tu-95 Bear bombers. How long the Chinese flotilla in the Tasman Sea will stay there and whether it will conduct more live-fire drills remain to be seen. The ships have already sent clear signals and their actions so far could be a sign of things to come well beyond this particular deployment.

X-37B Spaceplane Shares Earth Image For First Time As New Mission...	For the first time, the U.S. Space Force has released a photo of Earth taken by one of its secretive X-37B mini-shuttles. The image appears to be the first in-orbit shot from the craft of any kind to be officially released by the Pentagon. However, a brief video clip published in 2023 did show the service-module-equipped X-37B separating from its launch rocket after being lofted into space in 2020. Earth, seen from the perspective of the X-37B’s onboard camera, during its ongoing seventh mission. U.S. Space Force Courtesy Photo Master Sgt. Gustavo Castillo The new photo, published by the Defense Visual Information Distribution Service (DVIDS) yesterday, shows Earth captured by an X-37B’s onboard camera, during its seventh mission, sometime last year. The image was taken 'while conducting experiments in a highly elliptical orbit,' and the camera itself is primarily used to 'ensure the health and safety of the vehicle,' the Space Force says. The caption notes that the X-37B’s seventh mission included, for the first time, a series of aerobraking maneuvers, used to change its orbit using minimal fuel. The X-37B used on the OTV-6 mission on the flight line at the Kennedy Space Center after its return to Earth on November 12, 2022. U.S. Air Force The seventh X-37B mission, known as OTV-7, launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on December 28, 2023. The X-37B is still in orbit now, having passed 400 days in orbit on January 31 this year. You can find out more about the mission in TWZ’s previous reporting. In general, the Boeing-built X-37B has been incredibly camera-shy. Before the photo published yesterday, and the video clip from 2023, the U.S. Space Force and Boeing only released the first pictures of the service module — including ones showing the U.S. Air Force Academy’s FalconSat-8, a small cubesat, and other payloads loaded onto it — after the conclusion of the OTV-6 mission in 2022. A SpaceX video montage that includes a clip of the X-37B separating into space. The montage begins at approximately 3:38 in the runtime: Watch Falcon Heavy launch the USSF-52 mission to orbit SpaceX (@SpaceX) December 29, 2023 Boeing also previously released footage of an X-37B without the service module separating from its launch rocket during the OTV-1 mission, which began on April 22, 2010, and ended on December 3 of that year. This level of secrecy is hardly surprising given that the X-37Bs and their missions remain highly classified. This, in turn, has led to much speculation about their functions, including their potential use as space-based intelligence, reconnaissance, and surveillance (ISR) or weapons platforms. TWZ has discussed what is known about these spaceplanes and their capabilities in depth in the past. As for OTV-7, some details about the mission have gradually emerged, adding to what we already knew about it when it began. The launch, also known as USSF-52, used a Falcon Heavy rocket for the first time, meaning that the X-37B could be placed in a much higher orbit than on previous missions, as TWZ previously explored.

Orbits that take spacecraft beyond the GEO belt — which is defined as being around 22,236 miles (35,786 kilometers) above sea level — are categorized as high-Earth orbits (HEO). A graphic depicting the major different orbits around our planet, from low-Earth orbit (LEO), via medium-Earth orbit (MEO), to geostationary orbit (GEO). Sedrubal via Wikimedia Commons Furthermore, OTV-7 involves taking the X-37B for the first time on a highly elliptical orbit (confusingly, also known as HEO). In the past, former Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson referred to the X-37B’s ability to operate on a highly elliptical orbit, an egg-shaped trajectory that allows it to maneuver itself once it’s close enough to the atmosphere. The advantage of this is that it allows the spaceplane to reappear unexpectedly in orbit, making it harder for any potential adversaries to track. A video shows a notional trajectory of the X-37B in a highly elliptical orbit: 'We know that that drives them nuts, and I’m really glad about that,' Wilson said, back in 2019. A key aspect of the X-37B is that it is highly maneuverable and the spaceplanes have been observed changing their positions during previous missions. The Space Force had previously said that OTV-7 would include 'experimenting with future space domain awareness technologies, and investigating the radiation effects on materials provided by NASA.' As far as payloads for OTV-7 are concerned, the Space Force has so far only revealed that the X-37B is carrying NASA’s Seeds-2 experiment, which will explore what happens to plant seeds exposed to 'the harsh radiation environment of long-duration spaceflight.' We now know a little more about some of the various aspects of the mission, including that Boeing developed a new collision avoidance system ahead of OTV-7. For the current mission, the Space Force has identified about '1.7 million collision avoidance opportunities,' Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman told Aviation Week in a recent interview, referring to the threat posed by the proliferation of manmade objects in space. Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman, the senior uniformed officer heading the Space Force. U.S. Air Force photo by Andy Morataya The aforementioned aerobraking maneuver is another key aspect of OTV-7. According to Aviation Week, the X-37B vehicle needed some modifications, covering 'fault protection, autonomy, and collision avoidance' to make it capable of this maneuver. This involves the spaceplane using the drag of the atmosphere to dip into low-Earth orbit (LEO), during which it can separate from its service module. You can read more about the aerobraking maneuver in the context of the X-37B in this previous story. The X-37B used for the OTV-6 mission seen ahead of its launch in 2020 with the service module attached to its tail-end. This picture was released in November 2022 after OTV-6’s conclusion. U.S. Space Force Saltzman told the same publication that the aerobraking maneuver was also used to evaluate the Space Force’s Space Surveillance Network, a collection of optical and radar sensors used to detect, track, identify, and catalog all human-made objects in orbit. Finally, OTV-7 has been exploring autonomy, seen as vital as space becomes increasingly busy, especially since spaceplanes like the X-37B operate in various regimes. Saltzman also said in the interview that there were no plans to use the X-37B as an operational vehicle, but it’s clearly being used to gather data that will inform both potential future U.S. spaceplanes and also gain a better understanding of how adversaries could use similar systems. Most notably, China has been busy testing a spaceplane, named Shenlong (meaning Divine Dragon), which is understood to be broadly comparable to the X-37B. Unofficial concept artwork of the Chinese spaceplane, named Shenlong (meaning Divine Dragon). via Chinese Internet Some other details about the X-37B were recently provided to Aviation Week by Boeing’s Michelle Parker, company vice president for space mission systems. She confirmed that the company has been conducting continual upgrades on the X-37B, including introducing new types of batteries and solar cells. 'Even though it may look the same, a lot of the innards have been upgraded and then can continue to fly for a significant amount of time,' Parker told the magazine. While we may still be being drip-fed new information about the X-37B, the fact that more is being disclosed may well reflect calls from U.S. officials and members of Congress to reveal more regarding military activity in and related to space. The X-37B used in OTV-6 sits at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center. U.S. Air Force photo by Staff Sgt. Adam Shank With the X-37Bs now assigned to the Space Force’s main unit tasked with 'orbital warfare,' their military role is now made explicit. Meanwhile, more efforts have also been made to try and communicate to the public about the importance of space to military operations (and daily life) and potential threats outside of the Earth’s atmosphere, as well as what the U.S. government is doing about those issues. Bearing in mind the activities of near-peer adversaries like China or Russia, space is now indisputably a key military domain and potential battlefield in future conflicts. In particular, the ability of China and Russia to threaten U.S. and allied activities in space via various anti-satellite weapons is a growing area of concern. Currently, it’s unclear to what degree the new Trump administration might change how sensitive U.S. military space missions might be communicated to the public. However, the release of a photo showing — for the first time — the Earth seen from an X-37B is certainly a welcome glimpse into the still-secretive world of these hard-working spaceplanes.

New Hypersonic Strike-Recon Aircraft Effort Eyeing Prototype Deve...	The U.S. Air Force, in cooperation with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), is still exploring concepts for a reusable hypersonic air vehicle capable of performing strike and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Work being done now could lead to the start of the development of a flying Next Generation Responsive Strike (Next RS) prototype or demonstrator within the next five years. A secretive Air Force program called Mayhem with very similar stated objectives had become mired in uncertainty last year, including over whether there was even demand for a capability of this kind. The Next RS concept has emerged quietly over the past year or so in multiple DARPA contracting notices seeking proposals to meet various relevant technological needs. Aviation Week was first to report on the effort earlier this month. '[DARPA's] Aerospace Projects Office (APO), working in close partnership with [the] Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), develops and demonstrates technologies which enable Next Generation Responsive Strike (Next RS) air platforms,' one DARPA contracting notice put out on February 5 says. 'APO envisions reusable hypersonic aircraft attributes providing future multi-mission strike/ISR capabilities against targets protected by advanced air defense systems. APO is seeking innovative technologies that close the gap between the state-of-the-art in reusable hypersonics and the level of technical maturity required to initiate a NextRS Y-Plane design and development program later this decade.' A rendering of a notional hypersonic air vehicle. GE The notice lists six technological areas of interest that APO sees as key to advancing the Next RS concept: structures and materials, high-speed weapon separation, dual-mode propulsion, power generation, thermal management systems, and a high-Mach turbine engine. When it comes to dual-mode propulsion, APO is specifically looking at 'technologies that allow continuous powered operation of a Turbine Based Combined Cycle (TBCC) propulsion system over the entire flight envelope.' Advanced high-Mach turbine engine technology will also 'allow efficient TBCC operations through ascending and descending mode transition without the need for water injection.' 'DARPA seeks a better understanding of High Mach Gas Turbine (HMGT) developments to date and what technologies are needed to advance such an engine to the preliminary design level,' a separate Next RS-related contracting notice posted online in April 2024 adds. 'If this engine is going to be developed in the near term, DARPA also believes an existing core is needed as the heart of such an engine development program.' The April 2024 notice, which also highlights DARPA's work already on TBCC propulsion through the past Advanced Full Range Engine (AFRE) program, lays out a notional requirement for an HMGT capable of producing 30,000 to 38,000 pounds of continuous thrust. Other projected performance specifications are classified. A practical TBCC propulsion system has long been viewed as a something of a holy grail for very high-speed aircraft design. Ramjets and scramjets typically used to propel air-breathing air vehicles to hypersonic speeds, typically defined as anything about Mach 5, do not work properly at subsonic speeds and can have trouble operating efficiently even at low-supersonic speeds. As such, a significant initial boost velocity, usually provided by a rocket motor, is required before those engines can kick in. A TBCC combines ramjets/scramjets with jet turbines that work at lower speeds, and offers the ability to seamlessly shift from one mode to the other. An air vehicle with a TBCC propulsion system would be able to take off and land from suitably long existing runways, but cruise at high-supersonic or even hypersonic speeds, offering immense operational flexibility. A graphical depiction of a notional turbine-based combined cycle engine arrangement. Lockheed Martin The explicit mention in DARPA's February 5 contracting notice of 'technologies that allow weapons, weapon bays and ejection systems to accommodate hypersonic separation from aircraft and flyout to the target' is also worth discussing. Any air vehicle flying at hypersonic speed is subjected to immense physical and thermal stresses. Designing a payload bay that can safely open and release something under those conditions presents significant additional challenges. Whatever payload might be released would also be moving at hypersonic speeds, at least initially, and need to be able to withstand those stresses. The development of bespoke munitions would likely be required for an operational Next RS platform. 'The recent development of hypersonic weapons, whether scramjet based or boost-glide based systems, brought with it a resurgence in structural concepts and material development that could survive the hypersonic environment and weapon-like life cycles and timelines,' another contracting notice related to Next RS put out in April 2024 says, adding further context to the substantial materials science and engineering requirements. 'Advances in thermal protection systems, 'hot' structures and additively manufactured structures accompanied these development efforts. Likewise, research in composite materials such as carbon-carbon, infused carbon-carbon or ceramic matrix composites has followed.' 'These structural and material advances for hypersonic weapons are a necessary but not sufficient step towards enabling hypersonic aircraft structures which need to be reusable over larger operational timelines, weight efficient over large surfaces/airframes and primarily designed for thermal loads rather than mechanical loads,' that notice, which expresses interest in 'reusable, weight efficient, thermally driven, metallic airframe and skins,' adds. No further details about the platform or platforms that DARPA and the Air Force might be envisioning for Next RS, including overall size or payload capacity, are provided in any of the contracting notices. As yet, there are no clearly defined requirements that would point to a large aircraft with a big payload. When reached for additional information about the February 5 contracting notice, DARPA told TWZ it could not provide anything else. TWZ has also reached out to AFRL and NASA. Lockheed Martin However, the details about Next RS in hand now are extremely similar to how AFRL previously described the Mayhem program, also referred to as Hypersonic Multi-mission ISR and Strike, and an adjacent effort called Enabling Technologies for High-Speed Operable Systems (ETHOS). Leidos won a contract to develop a scramjet-powered Mayhem air vehicle, which was also expected to be air-launchable from another aircraft, in 2021. Leidos' team also included Calspan, the Draper Laboratory, and Kratos Defense & Security Solutions. However, by the beginning of last year, Mayhem's future had become very murky. 'AFRL is neither terminating the initial task order nor the Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract,' Air Force Col. Aaron Tucker, the High Speed Systems Division Chief at AFRL’s Aerospace Systems Directorate, told TWZ in February 2024. 'The initial task order will be fulfilled with a conceptual design review.' 'The Mayhem program did not receive funding in fiscal year 2024 to proceed beyond the scope of task order 1 (CoDR/SRR),' Tucker added. 'This funding decision results in a year-for-year slip in the development of a digital design and enabling technologies for an air-launched hypersonic ISR [intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance] & strike capability until funds are restored.' Furthermore, 'although AFRL is not terminating the existing contract with Leidos, the operational pull is not clear enough to warrant significant investment to launch and deliver a more complete design package suitable for an acquisition program,' AFRL spokesman Bryan Ripple also told TWZ at that time. 'AFRL may seek to add additional task orders to the Leidos contract in the future.' 'Air Force Global Strike Command [AFGSC] is conducting an Analysis of Alternatives, or AoA, over the next year to refine the requirement for high speed strike and the Office of the Secretary of Defense, or OSD, is continuing to refine leap ahead capability for reuseable applications,' Ripple added. 'What we are more interested in right now, in terms of a feasibility perspective, is a high-mach turbine engine,' a U.S. Air Force official also told TWZ when asked about AFGSC’s interest in Mayhem in February 2024. The current status of Mayhem is unclear and there is a possibility that Next RS is a follow-on or otherwise adjacent to that program. Mayhem, which first emerged back in 2020, has also been tied to another project called the Multi-Mission Cruiser and work on TBCC propulsion systems. The program appearance also followed a still highly curious burst of public discussion around reusable hypersonic aircraft capable of performing strike and ISR missions toward the late 2010s. Central to this was Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works advanced projects division very actively promoting a concept called the SR-72 – a reference to succeeding the company’s famed SR-71 Black Bird spy plane – and related developments. Former company CEO Marillyn Hewson talked openly about potentially building a fighter-sized hypersonic demonstrator for less than $1 billion in 2016. Rob Weiss, then head of Skunk Works, described hypersonic technology as 'mature' at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Aviation Forum the following year and there were reports that an actual flight test of a relevant design could come by 2018. Lockheed Martin's pronouncements even prompted Boeing to subsequently present a competing concept called Valkyrie. An artist’s conception of the proposed SR-72. Lockheed Martin An artist's conception of the proposed SR-72. Lockheed Martin By the end of the 2010s, the SR-72 had disappeared from Lockheed Martin's website and other promotional materials. Talk about the design resurfaced around Skunk Works' creation of a fictional hypersonic aircraft called the Darkstar for the 2022 blockbuster movie Top Gun: Maverick, a design said to be so realistic that parts of it 'could be more than mere fiction.' In 2022, Beoing also released a rendering of a new hypersonic aircraft design, seen below, which looked to have evolved from Valkyrie. The company would not say whether or not it was related to a pitch for Mayhem or work tied to any other U.S. government project. Boeing The Air Force has also publicly worked with various other firms on hypersonic aircraft concepts and related technologies, including with the Hermeus Corporation and Exosonic just in the past few. DARPA and NASA have done extensive research and development related to reusable hypersonic air vehicles over the years, as well. Hermeus has notably been working on a TBCC propulsion system called Chimera. The company is also progressing toward the first flight of its uncrewed Quarterhorse Mk. 1 aircraft, which is powered by a very mundane J85 turbojet engine and is not expected to fly at even supersonic speed. Quarterhorse Mk. 1 is the first of a planned series of designs with progressively more capable propulsion arrangements. We also don't know what else might have been or is still going on in the classified realm in terms of reusable hypersonic aircraft, including with regard to the SR-72 or a similar concept. Running unclassified efforts in parallel with classified ones is not unheard of, and doing so presents benefits, including allowing for the solicitation of proposals to meet certain needs from a wider pool of sources. Whether Next RS reflects work already being done in the classified domain is unknown. Regardless, as TWZ has written in the past about Mayhem: 'Still, a reusable uncrewed air-launched hypersonic strike and reconnaissance aircraft could certainly offer benefits in various operational scenarios. Such a system could be ideal for prosecuting time-sensitive targets, or just gathering intelligence on them, including deep in denied areas at extreme stand-off ranges. From an ISR perspective, spy satellites, which might be the only other option for collecting on the targets in question, could take too long to retask and are predictable, with the enemy knowing when they will pass overhead.' 'An air-launched reusable platform could offer additional flexibility in terms of vector of approach and timely arrival over a target area compared to regional ground and surface-launched concepts.' At the same time, there is a question about whether what a reusable hypersonic aircraft, with all of its complexities, has to offer could be better provided by other capabilities, such as stand-off munitions, including hypersonic types. Whether or not Next RS or any other project leads to an operational reusable hypersonic strike/ISR platform very much remains to be seen. An official Air Force report detailing a vision for that service, as well as the U.S. Space Force, by 2050, which was published in December, notably makes no mention of reusable hypersonic air vehicles, though it does talk about expendable hypersonic weapons. That report did also highlight ever-more serious air defense threats, including anti-air missiles with ranges of up to 1,000 miles, which is in line with the stated drivers behind the Next RS effort. Lockheed Martin Earlier this month, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth also ordered the Air Force to pause a large swath of modernization efforts until a new Air Force Secretary has been confirmed and can review those plans. Hegseth has also issued a memo directing a review of proposed Fiscal Year 2026 spending plans with a goal of shifting roughly eight percent of the entire Department of Defense budget, or approximately $50 billion, to new Trump administration priorities like the Iron Dome missile defense initiative, according to Breaking Defense. The memo, which has not been released publicly, was first reported on by The Washington Post. The Air Force has already been facing an increasingly serious crisis over the affordability of its many modernization priorities. Budgetary concerns, driven in large part by the ballooning costs of the Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) program, notably triggered a deep review last year of plans for a new sixth-generation crewed combat jet being developed under the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative. No decision about the NGAD combat jet's future, which is also intertwined with planning around new Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones and stealth aerial refueling tankers, has been announced so far. All of this has fed into new questions about the optimal size of the future B-21 Raider stealth bomber fleet, as well. A rendering of a notional sixth-generation crewed combat jet. Collins Aerospace What is clear from the emergence of Next RS in the DARPA contracting notice this month is that there remains at least some interest within the Air Force in a reusable hypersonic strike/ISR platform.

Trump Mulls Options To Accelerate Delivery Of Air Force One Jets	President Donald Trump appears to be looking at alternative options for the next Air Force One presidential jet, which has seen its delivery date potentially pushed beyond 2029. As well as recently inspecting a Boeing 747-8 once belonging to the ruling family of Qatar, Trump is reportedly looking into ways of speeding the delivery of the two future VC-25B presidential aircraft, including relaxing security clearances for those working on the jets. The two VC-25Bs are being converted from 747-8i airliners, as you can read more about here. They are due to replace the two existing VC-25As, the first of which entered service in 1990. The VC-25As are based on older 747-200s that are increasingly challenging to support. One of the current VC-25A Air Force One aircraft is seen landing for U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit to the NASCAR Cup Series Daytona 500 at Daytona International Speedway on February 16, 2025, in Daytona Beach, Florida. Photo by Chris Graythen/Getty Images Chris Graythen The 747-8i was the final airliner variant of Boeing’s iconic 747 aircraft and production of the 747 series, as a whole, came to an end for good in December 2022. This means that the new Air Force One presidential jets have to be converted from existing, second-hand airframes, which brings its own set of problems. The final deal for the new Air Force Ones was negotiated under the previous Trump administration, but the process has been far from smooth since then. Last summer, the first flight of the VC-25B was pushed back to March 2026, a delay of 16 months. On top of years of delays, Boeing has recorded over $2 billion in losses on the program, the contract for which was negotiated on a fixed-price basis. Already staggeringly expensive, the new Air Force One program will cost around $4.7 billion for the jets alone, making them the most expensive aircraft ever built. Adding the ancillary costs, including an enormous new hangar at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, with a price tag of around $250 million, provides a total program cost of around $5.3 billion. This is taking into account the much-publicized claims by President Trump that he personally slashed the cost of the jets, although that is debatable. According to Breaking Defense, the Air Force was, as of mid-December, 'still working to validate the schedule' for delivery. This schedule should be completed this spring. The Air Force will then 'conduct a schedule risk assessment to inform establishing revised' dates for key milestones, including delivery dates and operational capability. One of the Boeing 747-8i jets now in the process of becoming a VC-25B Air Force One aircraft heads to Texas in March 2019 to begin conversion. Matt Hartman/Shorealone Films Earlier this week, it was revealed that the VC-25Bs may not be delivered until 2029 or even later — this would mean Trump would not get the opportunity to fly in the aircraft before the end of his second term in office. At one time, the first aircraft had been slated for delivery in December 2024, but Boeing then pushed that back until at least 2027 or 2028. This latest delay was confirmed to Reuters by a White House official, who cited supply chain issues and changing requirements as the reasons. They said that the delay could actually stretch 'years beyond' 2029. The official pointed to problems in acquiring components for the aircraft since some of the manufacturers had gone out of business. At the same time, they noted that some requirements have been revised based on 'evolving potential threats,' according to the report.

Since taking office, it seems that Trump, frustrated by the mounting delays, might have taken a more direct approach, including engaging his close ally Elon Musk. At the end of last month, Boeing’s Ortberg told CNBC that 'we’re working with Elon to see what can we do to pull up the schedule.' In remarks today, Ortberg added: 'Elon Musk is actually helping us a lot in working through the requirements … so that we can move faster and get the president those airplanes delivered.' More details of some of the options Trump and Musk might be looking at emerged today in a report from The New York Times, which cites five unnamed people with knowledge of the discussions. Elon Musk holds up an Air Force One stuffed toy as he walks from the presidential helicopter Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House on February 19, 2025, in Washington, DC. Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images Win McNamee The most radical option in that report involves 'relaxing security clearance standards for some who work on the presidential planes.' This would mean that Boeing could engage workers for the VC-25B that don’t have the currently required high-level Yankee White security clearance, the same that military personnel would need for interaction with the president or the vice president. Reportedly, officials are only looking at relaxing the clearance for employees not involved in most secure parts. Nevertheless, the implications of such a move, were it to happen, would be significant. After all, every aspect of the Air Force One platforms is closely tailored to ensure the highest levels of security, befitting its mission, including as an airborne command center. While it’s claimed that Boeing officials consider that relaxing some security clearance standards is possible, for certain types of workers, anything that could compromise the safety of the president — and the security of the United States — would clearly be unacceptable. Musk is reportedly also critical of the amount of time built into the program for flight testing. Again, however, any move that could compromise the safety requirements for Air Force One is hardly likely to be palatable, especially when the net gain might only be getting it into service several months earlier. A rendering of a VC-25B with the livery President Trump selected during his first term in office. Boeing Reportedly, Musk visited the Boeing facility in San Antonio, Texas, last December, intending to find ways to accelerate the production of the VC-25Bs. 'The idea was that we could just strip out a lot of the military stuff, just give the president a good-looking new airplane to fly in with commercial capabilities and maybe some minimal military upgrades,' an unnamed former Pentagon official told The New York Times. While that would certainly be feasible, the end result would most not fit the Air Force One requirements, including playing its part in the critical ‘continuity of government’ mission — which you can read about in-depth here — and operating in the most demanding situations, including a nuclear apocalypse. As well as being hardened against the effects of electromagnetic pulse (EMP), it’s also worth bearing in mind that the VC-25s are equipped with extremely elaborate communications systems and the most capable single self-defense suite against man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS), as well as some other threats, found anywhere on the planet. The article also states that consideration is being given to acquiring another airframe, which would be refitted at short notice and then used as an interim transport until the VC-25Bs are ready. This would be the 747-8 that Trump toured at Palm Beach International, Florida, on Saturday. This 12-year-old aircraft previously belonged to the ruling family of Qatar but was subsequently refurbished and is now privately owned. You can read all about it in this previous in-depth piece.

It arrived from Doha and returned there shortly after the tour. pic.twitter.com/PvLGFVs43l&mdash; Jack Sweeney (@Jxck_Sweeney) February 17, 2025 The White House said that Trump wanted to look at the ex-Qatari jet to see 'how everything was configured,' in relation to the new VC-25Bs, although The New York Times suggests that the president might actually want the Air Force to buy it. If that were the case, it is extremely questionable whether the ex-Qatari 747-8 would offer anything like a practical solution — especially the reported aspiration to have the jet retrofitted for the Air Force service 'within a year’s time.' After all, even for interim service, the aircraft would still require extensive conversion work followed by certification and it’s far from clear how all this could be achieved in such a short timeframe — let alone, why it would be significantly easier than is the case with the VC-25Bs. Were the ex-Qatari 747-8 somehow rushed into service in a more basic configuration that would be achieved quicker, it would leave the Air Force with a non-standard presidential fleet once the VC-25Bs finally arrive. It may also be the case that Trump’s visit to the ex-Qatari jet was more about providing Boeing with a very obvious signal that the high-stakes Air Force One program is very much in his sights. Another proposition could involve canceling Boeing’s Air Force One contract altogether and handing the work over to another contractor. The most obvious would be Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC), which has been contracted to deliver a fleet of highly specialized Survivable Airborne Operations Center (SAOC) aircraft. These will replace the Air Force’s aging 747-200-based E-4B Nightwatch ‘doomsday planes.’ However, while Trump has been repeatedly critical of Boeing’s business practice in the past, such a radical move at this stage would likely also not get the new Air Force Ones into service any quicker. Whatever happens next, Boeing’s VC-25B effort has become something of a lesson in how not to run an Air Force acquisition program. Already, there have been issues with security clearance lapses for workers involved in the program and the discovery of empty liquor bottles in one of the airframes. There have also been tiny cracks discovered in the aircraft’s structures, requiring repairs. A rendering of a VC-25B in a paint scheme more in line with the iconic ones on the existing VC-25A Air Force Ones. President Joe Biden reversed the decision made by his predecessor, Donald Trump, during his first term in office, which would have seen the aircraft wear an entirely new red, white, and blue livery. Depending on the delivery timeline, that would appear to be now back on the table. U.S. Air Force One of the biggest stories surrounding the new Air Force One jets is their paint scheme. Trump wants to get rid of the classic design that is steeped in Kennedy-era history and replace it with his own red, white and blue look. It's possible that if the jets get pushed nearly into 2030, he will not get to make this decision. It's only the delays in the program that put the Air Force One paint job question back in his lap after being elected to his second term.

However, it’s already clear that, under the Trump administration, these high-profile aircraft will be under even closer scrutiny.

M10 Booker Undergoing Cold Weather Trials In Alaska	Eyeing a potential future fight in the Arctic, the Army is putting its new light tank-like M10 Booker Combat Vehicle through a series of cold-weather tests at Fort Greely, Alaska. The trials come as the U.S. military is seeking to boost its ability to fight in the Arctic, an area of increasing strategic importance. Soldiers are conducting 'primarily reliability testing as well as automotive, systems and firing at extreme cold temperatures,' Ashely John, a spokesperson for the Army’s Next Generation Ground Vehicle Cross-Functional Team told us. The Greely cold-weather trial was prescribed when Booker’s testing plan was approved in Fiscal Year 2022, she added. There is also hot weather testing underway, both of which are normal for major weapons systems like this. (U.S. Army) It is unclear when the testing at Greely will conclude, how it performed in the cold or what soldiers using the vehicles think about them. We asked the Army and will update this story with any pertinent details provided. The Booker was designed under the Mobile Protected Firepower (MPF) program to fill a capability gap the Army identified after two decades of largely counter-insurgency operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. There was little need at the time for a light tank-like vehicle that could bridge the gap between the M-1 Abrams main battle tank and armored vehicles like the Bradley and Stryker. A Stryker Mobile Gun System variant had a 105mm gun, but the Army divested that in 2021 because of problems with its dated cannon and autoloader. That platform was also far less protected than the Booker and its wheels meant it could not navigates rough terrain like the tracked M10 can. With an MTU 8v199 TE-22, 800 hp diesel engine and an Allison transmission, the Booker can travel at up to about 40 mph. Armed with a 105mm main gun, the vehicles won’t have as much firepower as the Abrams with its 120mm gun. Nor will the Bookers have as much armor to protect them. But they will require much less fuel and a far smaller logistical tail, and they will still be able to deliver a badly needed punch that can destroy armor, bunkers, and fortifications. Perhaps more importantly, they will get to the fight, including arriving at remote locales via airlift, far faster than an Abrams ever could. This could be critical in defending arctic locales during a crisis. You can learn more about the Booker in our detailed profile video below. The Army is planning to to buy more than 500 Bookers from General Dynamics Land Systems and have four Booker battalions fielded by 2030, with most of the planned acquisition scheduled to be completed by 2035, according to the Congressional Research Service (CRS). With a projected price tag of about $13 million a piece, the total package would be about $6.5 billion. The total life-cycle cost of the program, including sustainment, military construction and personnel, is estimated at $17 billion, Defense News reported. You can read more about the Booker’s capabilities and planned future role in our story here. The M10 Booker's 105mm main gun is powerful enough to take on Chinese armor, says an armor expert. (U.S. Army photo) The Army has previously described operating in the Arctic, where the lowest temperatures can reach between −65 and −50° F, as just being a struggle to survive, let alone fight an enemy. At Fort Greely, winters have an average temperature of -13°F. That drastic climate creates extreme stress on troops and equipment. That played out in 2022 when the Army withdrew a fleet of 8×8 Stryker wheeled vehicles from Alaska in part because of persistent difficulties in keeping them running in cold weather conditions. Those vehicles had been assigned to what is now known as 1st Brigade Combat Team, 11th Airborne Division at Fort Wainwright in Fairbanks. In 2022, the division received BvS10 Beowulf tracked vehicles as its new Cold Weather All-Terrain Vehicle, or CATV to help transport troops and equipment. You can read more about how the Army is trying to cope with fighting under frigid conditions in our deep dive here. Beowulf can carry up to 14 soldiers. (BAE Systems) BAE Systems For the Army, being able to conduct combat operations in the Arctic is critical. The region has seen renewed strategic attention from the U.S. military for years now. Global climate change has caused the polar ice caps to recede, opening up new access to natural resources and trade routes. This, in turn, has created new geopolitical competition, and the potential for conflict, especially with Russia and China, as a byproduct. President Donald Trump’s keen interest in acquiring Greenland highlights the importance of the Arctic. There are several challenges when an armor track vehicle operates in the cold. 'Arctic conditions make starting armored vehicle engines, especially diesel engines, difficult due to battery power loss and potential fuel gelling,' an armor expert familiar with the Booker told us. 'Preheating techniques may be necessary, and fuel additives (such as anti-gel treatments) are required to prevent it from thickening up depending if it’s diesel or JP8.' In addition, 'batteries and electronics may have issues due to extreme cold, reducing battery efficiency affecting vehicle startup, communications systems, and fire control systems,' the expert explained. 'Also electrical wiring insulation can become brittle and crack, increasing the risk of malfunctions.' There can be hydraulic and lubrication issues as well 'because Arctic temperatures thicken hydraulic fluids and lubricants slowing turret traverse and gun elevation,' the expert noted. 'Also, the oil viscosity changes can reduce engine and transmission efficiency.' The rubber tracks 'may become brittle and more prone to cracking. The track suspension such as torsion bars, and shock absorbers may stiffen, impacting ride quality and performance over rough terrain. Finally, snow and ice buildup in the running gear can cause track slippage and jamming,' according to the expert. Beyond that, 'condensation on the optics, sensors, circuit boards, and other electronics caused by the rapid temperature changes can lead to ice buildups and then lead to malfunctioning.' Testing armor like this M1 Abrams tank at Fort Greely can find glitches in cold weather operations unimaginable in the desert. (Sebastian Saarloos) The Arctic testing will be important to see whether Booker is suitable for the region beyond just being able to stand up to the elements. Mobility and smaller logistics trains are two critical requirements for the Arctic, where bases are few and far between, increasing the challenge of keeping vehicles maintained and fueled. At 41 tons, the Booker weighs about 40% less than the Abrams. Smaller in dimensions and having no heavy side skirt, two can be delivered by a single C-17 Globemaster III, roll out of its cargo bay, and be combat-ready for wherever needed far more rapidly than an Abrams, the expert said. By contrast, only one 70-plus-ton Abrams can fit on a C-17 and they can take days to reach their destination. The Arctic isn’t the only place where the Army is testing Booker. The vehicles are also undergoing testing at the Yuma Proving Ground (YPG) in Arizona. 'In addition to test firing the armaments in both the natural environment and from a cold chamber, the platform is being subjected to a full complement of performance and reliability, accessibility, and maintainability testing,' the Army said in a recent media release. 'Test vehicles are running across punishing desert road courses, up steep slopes, and through a watery fording basin, sometimes while under a full load.' 'The data we are collecting is for a decision on full rate production next summer,' said Jade Janis, YPG test officer. The M10 Booker undergoing tests at the Yuma Proving Ground in Arizona. (Mark Shauer) There is plenty of additional testing planned for these vehicles, as well. Beyond how it performs in the cold and other trials, Booker faces other challenges. The war in Ukraine has, in some respects, changed the way armor is looked at on the modern battlefield. In particular, armor has shown itself extremely vulnerable to drones, especially first-person view (FPV) variants. Alterations to existing designs — none of which Booker possesses at this time — has helped harden them against this threat, but even the Abrams remains susceptible to it. 'Given this threat and reported vulnerability, Congress might further explore with the Army-specific M-10 design characteristics and countermeasures intended to address the threat posed by UAS and loitering munitions,' the Congressional Research Service (CRS) suggested in its report on the vehicle last month. In addition, the Trump administration is eyeing the Pentagon budget and cuts to weapons programs and enhancements to others are sure to be on the horizon. Time will tell whether the Army procures the hundreds of Bookers it wants.

This Is What A Peacekeeping Air Policing Mission Over Ukraine Cou...	The United Kingdom is reportedly prepared to send Typhoon fighters to support a future air policing mission over Ukraine. The apparent proposal comes only a day after the leaders of several European nations met to discuss whether to send troops to help bolster any deal to end the Ukraine war, something you can read more about here. The Times of London today cited a 'senior government source' as saying that an 'air policing' mission for Ukraine would make sense, although also warning that it would need significant numbers of aircraft, as well as ground-based air defense systems to protect the jets on the ground. A Russian Su-30SM Flanker and an RAF Typhoon over the Baltic Sea during a Baltic Air Policing mission in May 2019. Crown Copyright The same report suggests that British ministers have already discussed ways to provide security guarantees to Ukraine without the need for large numbers of troops on the ground. With that in mind, one proposal involves potentially 'dozens' of U.K. Royal Air Force (RAF) Typhoons that would monitor Russian air activity and help protect a 'smaller peacekeeping force of troops' from the United Kingdom and other European countries on the ground. Previously, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that a future peacekeeping force might require as many as 110,000 foreign troops on the ground in the country, with perhaps three times that number in total to enable rotational deployments.

It now seems that a more powerful air policing contingent might be increasingly seen as a way of compensating for the smaller troop presence, which would otherwise be insufficient to monitor and patrol the extent of whatever Ukraine’s future land border with Russian-controlled territory will look like. Regardless of where the border will be redrawn and to what degree Ukraine gets parts of its sovereign territory back, this new border would become the line of control. An unnamed RAF source told The Times of London that an air policing mission was more likely than a no-fly zone of the kind that would normally serve to sanitize airspace above an area that does not benefit from a line of control. A Russian Il-20 Coot-A aircraft intercepted during a QRA scramble by RAF Typhoons from Siauliai Air Base, Lithuania, in June 2020. Crown Copyright In contrast, an air policing mission is primarily a peacetime effort that provides surveillance as well as fighter aircraft that can rapidly respond to possible airspace violations and other contingencies. Of course, the nature of the response will then depend on a host of operational considerations, but it could extend to engaging that aircraft if it was determined to be undertaking a hostile action. All this would depend on the nature of the potential ceasefire agreement — at this point, we are still in the very early stages of such an agreement taking shape. Already, however, there are reports that consideration has been given to basing air policing aircraft in Poland, while the same RAF source added: 'We are prepared to do whatever we are told to do.' TWZ spoke to Air Marshal (Ret’d.) Greg Bagwell, the president of the Air and Space Power Association, one of the RAF’s most experienced former operational commanders, who oversaw combat operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and Syria, as well as various peacekeeping missions worldwide. Air Vice Marshal Greg Bagwell speaking to the media at an Italian Air Force base from where the RAF was patrolling the no-fly zone over Libya in 2011. Photo by Chris Ison/PA Images via Getty Images Chris Ison - PA Images Bagwell notes that the U.K. military will almost certainly already be doing contingency planning for a potential peacekeeping mission. 'I would be amazed if people in the Ministry of Defense, Permanent Joint Headquarters, and the likes weren’t at least thinking through some of the challenges and some of the things that you’d need to put in place as part of it. Some of that conversation may even leak into NATO, or European nations of a like mind — a coalition of the willing, if you like — so that they could think through what sort of assets would be needed and who might provide them.' At this early stage, however, nothing will be formal and, as Bagwell observes, 'Nobody’s asked the exact question, apart from just making offers, or just talking about it in principle.' Obviously, any air policing mission for Ukraine, or whatever kind of peacekeeping force, first requires a peace to keep. 'If it is a peacekeeping mission, then it would need agreed rules, if you like, for what that peace was supposed to be, which would include boundaries and the rules of engagement to match,' Bagwell says. Bagwell also notes that the talk of European nations sending 'troops' to Ukraine, or in support of Ukraine, post-ceasefire, could also refer to air forces (and navies) as well as ground troops. 'It could be anybody from any service depending on the requirement … whatever it would take to maintain peace and you’re going to need to do that on land, sea, and air.' British RAF and Czech Air Force personnel at Ämari Air Base in Estonia, as part of the NATO Baltic Air Policing mission. Crown Copyright 'Peacekeeping is often about keeping two sides apart. In this particular case, let’s be honest, we’re pretty much talking about keeping one side out. I would expect that policing to be done almost exclusively on the Ukrainian side of that line, and it would be both to keep an eye on any air activity and any potential encroachment, but it would also be used to keep an eye on anything going on the ground, both at the border and beyond.' In such a scenario, the aircraft involved — be they RAF, other NATO, or from different friendly nations — would be used to patrol the line of control. Ultimately, their job would be to forbid Russian aircraft — but potentially also Ukrainian aircraft — from encroaching within a certain distance, whatever that distance may turn out to be. A Russian Su-27 Flanker' intercepted by RAF Typhoons over the Baltic Sea in May 2023. Crown Copyright 'The problem is, these days, with the long range of air-launched weapons, you need to keep airplanes quite a long way away to ensure that they’re not releasing weapons or potentially conducting an attack. So that buffer might become quite large.' Even so, Bagwell considers that creating a buffer zone exclusively within Ukraine would be sufficient in this particular case. As well as monitoring the airspace for aircraft encroaching beyond the line of control, the mission would almost certainly involve some monitoring of forces on the ground, too. This would then raise the question of how close Ukrainian and Russian ground forces would be allowed to get within that line. Whatever the rules, this is something that would probably be easiest to monitor from the air or space.

Photo by Diego Herrera Carcedo/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu 'To airmen, the problem won’t be that challenging,' Bagwell contends. 'I mean, if it goes wrong, it will be challenging. But in terms of working out how to segregate the airspace, how to have the right sensors in the right places to detect what’s going on, and then to have the rules of engagement, and the right things in the right places to intercept or investigate or warn off. If it gets really sticky, those are well-worn procedures that you just have to apply and adapt to the specific circumstances.' The fact that participants — very likely NATO members — would potentially be going head-to-head with Russian forces 'obviously carries an additional degree of risk,' Bagwell notes, 'but we’ve done that pretty recently in Syria. We’ve had Western coalition assets flying extremely close to Russian assets, and we’ve managed just about stay out of each other’s way. But it gets fruity at times.' Footage of a Russian Su-35S Flanker that reportedly violated coalition airspace in Syria in April 2023, before being intercepted by U.S. Air Force fighters: There are then logistical questions to address, although it already seems inconceivable that an air policing mission for Ukraine could be conducted by the RAF alone — at least if it were to be both fully capable and to endure over an extended period. Policing such a large area would involve an operation with a degree of magnitude bigger than anything that the RAF has attempted in recent history and would surely only be attempted as part of a broader coalition. 'The border itself is vast,' Bagwell says. 'You’re talking about covering a very large piece of airspace. I think the real question is ‘How secure is the peace?’ If we’ve got to a situation where both sides have stood back from each other and are not literally staring at each other from a trench 100 yards away, if they are now miles apart, and things have returned to a relatively stable situation, then monitoring that more stable situation is something that can be done from a more measured perspective.' In theory, Bagwell notes, such a situation could involve a ground alert scenario where, if it was known, for example, that an aircraft had got airborne and was heading west, a fighter could get airborne and head east to ensure that it didn’t encroach. In this way, it’s conceivable that the operation could get to a stage where it would require a relatively low posture in terms of numbers, but offer very fast response times. A Romanian Air Force F-16 and a pair of Typhoons conduct an intercept as part of a NATO training mission in Romania. Crown Copyright SAC Harry Roberts 'That’s the beauty of air, of course — it can respond quickly,' Bagwell continues. 'You could, in theory, control minor incursions or relatively small amounts of air activity.' On the other hand, if the situation as regards Russia were to become more hostile, to the point where the air policing force was facing 'a hornets’ nest, but only 50 miles away,' then the scenario would look altogether different, as Bagwell explains. 'You’re then effectively looking to deter; it goes beyond air policing and then really does become a sort of air deterrence mission, where you’re saying: ‘Don’t you dare cross here, because you’ll get something back at you’ — assuming you’ve got rules of engagement for that.' However, even providing a ground-alert-type operation, in a relatively stable environment, would involve a lot of assets and expenditure. Furthermore, these assets would likely have to be in Ukraine, Bagwell contends, from where they would be able to fly three or four combat air patrols, between 100 and 200 miles apart, up and down the border, flying around the clock to maintain an air presence. This would be impossible for the RAF to achieve on its own, demanding a multinational rotational force. Bagwell provides the example of putting just one combat air patrol up with two aircraft — which he says would be the bare minimum. 'Just to keep those two jets in that orbit for 24 hours takes almost a squadron’s worth of airplanes and crews to sustain it in the long term, because you’re putting two up every couple of hours … in a worst-case scenario, you could easily swallow up the entire Royal Air Force’s assets if they were doing on it their own, just to give you an idea of scale.' A live-armed RAF Typhoon returning to its base after a scramble callout for a Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) mission over the North Sea near U.K. airspace. Crown Copyright For the best-case scenario, Bagwell expects the operation 'might be able to get away with one or two squadrons, one or two airborne radar airplanes, and a few tankers, but that would be thin, and if Russia tested it, it would be found wanting pretty quickly.' Airborne early warning would be a critical asset for this kind of mission, giving the ability to see a lot further into Russian airspace, especially from a relatively high altitude, fairly close to the border. This would allow incoming aircraft to be detected very early on. A NATO E-3A Airborne Warning And Control System (AWACS) aircraft takes off from the NATO air base at Geilenkirchen, Germany. Photo by Christof Koepsel/Getty Images Christof Koepsel While Bagwell can envisage that a Ukraine air policing operation could be a relatively low-cost scenario, compared to a bigger deployment of peacekeeping ground troops, his instinct is that considering it might be unclear how it plays out, commanders 'might want to err on the side of caution and put more in than they need.' For a larger-scale operation, the possibility exists to have assets flown from outside Ukraine, for example operating from bases in Poland or Romania and then flying into Ukraine on patrol, using air-to-air refueling. On the other hand, having other nations on the ground in Ukraine — including in the form of aircraft — could also have a deterrent value, forcing Russia to think twice about future incursions, because of the complications it would bring. Ultimately, there would be an aspiration that Ukraine would be able to take on at least some of the burden of air policing duties, something that will now be easier since it’s receiving Western fighter aircraft — first the F-16, and more recently the Mirage 2000. These aircraft types are already more capable of being integrated into a Western-style air defense system, which would also give Ukraine the ability to plug into a broader network and make it more capable as a peacetime policing air force. A pair of Ukrainian Air Force F-16s configured for an air defense mission. Photo by Vitalii Nosach/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images Photo by Vitalii Nosach/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images On the other hand, it remains to be seen just how quickly Ukraine can adjust and adapt to policing its own airspace, also based on the number of Western fighters it is receiving and the speed with which it can integrate these newer systems. Regardless, having the Ukrainian Air Force conduct these kinds of post-ceasefire operations would no longer be peacekeeping, but a continuation of two sides standing off against each other. Once again, this brings us to the argument that politicians in Europe are now grappling with, which suggests that air policing needs to be done independently by a third party. Herein lies the problem of Russia’s reluctance to have a third party involved that is also a NATO member or operating under some kind of NATO jurisdiction. Without a doubt, the situation is complicated. In Bagwell’s words, 'this is probably as tricky as it gets,' based on the potential consequences of something going wrong. At the same time, it’s worth noting that NATO’s Article Five wouldn’t cover NATO assets operating in Ukraine, since it doesn’t extend outside the alliance’s boundary. This would be a factor if Russia engaged a NATO aircraft involved in a Ukraine air policing mission, although it’s doubtful that the alliance would simply let Russia trample over a Western presence in the country without any sort of response. It’s here that U.S. involvement in any kind of air policing effort is perhaps most critical. If Europe’s NATO allies are to go it alone and set up some kind of air policing initiative, it will still be a relatively small stick compared to Russia’s military might. As such, it will surely benefit from America’s much bigger stick to back it up.

F-16s With Larger Laser-Guided Rocket Loads, Drone Kill Marking E...	New pictures show U.S. Air Force F-16C Viper fighters on patrol in and around the Middle East with loadouts that include two seven-shot 70mm rocket pods, and both on the same pylon, rather than just one as has been seen previously. The same images also show an F-16C armed with a mix of AIM-120 AMRAAM and AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles and sporting a drone kill marking. TWZ first reported last month that Air Force Vipers have been using laser-guided 70mm Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II (APKWS II) rockets, originally designed as air-to-ground munitions, as a lower-cost way to down Houthi drones. The U.S. Air Forces Central (AFCENT), the service's top command for operations in the Middle East, released two sets of pictures of F-16s flying in the region earlier today. The photographs were all taken earlier this month. A pair of US Air Force F-16Cs fly somewhere over the Middle East on February 11, 2025. The jet seen at the rear has the two seven-shot 70mm rocket pods. USAF Staff Sgt. Jackson Manske The image sets show pairs of F-16Cs flying together and, in both cases, one of the Vipers has a pair of seven-round 70mm rocket pods on a single pylon under its right wing with the help of a triple ejector rack (TER), as seen below. Each of the rocket-armed jets also are seen carrying two AIM-9X Sidewinders, two AIM-120s, a LITENING targeting pod, a HARM Targeting System (HTS) pod, and two drop tanks. As noted, pictures AFCENT has previously released have shown F-16s with one rocket pod instead of two, but otherwise similar load-outs. A version of the single rocket pod loadout has also been observed on Vipers forward-deployed in Japan. USAF The other Vipers seen in the new pictures are armed with four Sidewinders each – a mixture of AIM-9M and AIM-9X variants – and two AIM-120s, as well as the same array of pods and drops tanks. One of these jets also has a drone kill marking, as well as six others that are silhouettes of a revolver, on the left side of the fuselage right under the forward end of the cockpit canopy. What the revolvers signify is unknown, but they might reflect the destruction of targets with the jet's 20mm M61 Vulcan cannon, a six-barrel Gatling-type design. This particular aircraft also has three large rows of badly worn air-to-ground mission marks. A picture of the air-to-air missile-armed F-16 with the kill markings. USAF A close-up look at the kill markings. Some of the faded air-to-ground mission marks are also visible. USAF Other U.S. military combat jets, as well as American and other foreign warships, have previously emerged with drone and missile kill markings in relation to operations against the Houthis in and around the Red Sea. A Navy EA-18G Growler electronic warfare jet also now has a silhouette of a Hind attack helicopter painted on its fuselage after having blown one up on the ground in Yemen with an AGM-88E Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile (AARGM), which TWZ was first to confirm. The appearance of F-16s in the Middle East with larger rocket loads is not surprising. As TWZ highlighted in January in our first report on the use of APKWS II in the air-to-air role, even a single seven-shot pod of the laser-guided rockets dramatically increases the Viper's total magazine depth. As seen again in the newly released pictures, an F-16 with a more typical air-to-air loadout carries just six missiles. An annotated image of an Air Force F-16C flying in the Middle East with the single rocket pod loadout. USAF Underscoring the importance of magazine depth, during the separate U.S. operations in the defense of Israel against incoming waves of Iranian drones and missiles, F-15E Strike Eagles had to land and rearm while threats were still passing overhead. At least one Strike Eagle crew switched to the jet's Vulcan cannon after running out of missiles, but was unable to down any targets with the gun. The F-15E has far more payload capacity than the F-16C to begin with, though the Strike Eagle is not currently cleared to carry APKWS IIs. An F-15E Strike Eagle brandishing various air-to-air missiles and precision-guided bombs during a recent sortie somewhere in the Middle East. USAF There's also the associated cost benefit. An APKWS II rocket consists of a laser guidance kit slotted in between one of a variety of warheads and a standard 70mm rocket motor. A single guidance unit costs between around $15,000 to $20,000. Warheads and motors add a few thousand dollars more to the price tag of each complete rocket. By comparison, traditional air-to-air missiles are hundreds of thousands of dollars or more apiece. APKWS II does have limitations in the air-to-air role. As TWZ has previously explained: 'In an air-to-air engagement, the laser designator in the LITENING pod could be used to ‘laze’ or designate the target. LITENING’s sensor turret can be slaved to the radar on the aircraft carrying it, or vice versa. So-called buddy lasing, where one aircraft designates the target for another, could also be useful in this case, especially given the speed differential between typical Houthi drones and F-16s. One jet could keep the target steadily lazed while the other makes its attack run.' 'APKWS IIs are usable against drones, as well as subsonic cruise missiles, in the first place because those are relatively steady, non-reactionary, low-performance targets. The rockets are not dogfighting weapons.' After first being demonstrated as an air-to-air weapon, at least publicly, in 2019, APKWS II has clearly become a valuable addition to the U.S. military's aerial arsenal in this role. Further expanded loadouts could now begin to emerge. Asymmetrical load of two seven-shot pods under each wing would give an F-16 28 total engagement opportunities just with laser-guided rockets. Similar loadouts could be a boon for other aircraft, especially when facing down large drone and missile attacks. In addition to the Viper, the AV-8B Harrier, A-10 Warthog, and F/A-18 Hornet fixed-wing aircraft, as well as AH-1Z, UH-1Y, and MH-60R/S helicopters, are currently cleared to employ APKWS II. APKWS II is also combat-proven in the surface-to-air role against drones and as a surface-to-surface weapon, as well as an air-to-ground munition. There is work now to at least test a passive infrared seeker for the rockets, which would further expand their capabilities, as you can read more about here. The use of the 70mm laser-guided rockets in the air-to-air role, at least in the Middle East, already looks to be expanding.

War Of Words Erupts Between Trump And Zelensky	The war of words between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky erupted on Wednesday in a remarkable series of tit-for-tat accusations highlighting a growing schism between Washington and Kyiv. The increasingly harsh exchanges come in the wake of U.S.-Russia negotiations to end the war in Ukraine and the sudden move to normalize relations between the U.S. and Russia. The talks in Riyadh did not provide Ukraine with a seat at the negotiating table. In a post on his Truth Social platform Wednesday morning, Trump called Zelensky a 'moderately successful comedian' and strongly implied a lack of support for Ukraine and its leader. 'A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left,' Trump stated. '…I love Ukraine, but Zelenskyy has done a terrible job, his Country is shattered, and MILLIONS have unnecessarily died – And so it continues…..' Think of it, a modestly successful comedian, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, talked the United States of America into spending $350 Billion Dollars, to go into a War that couldn’t be won, that never had to start, but a War that he, without the U.S. and 'TRUMP,' will never be able to settle.…&mdash; Donald J. Trump Posts From His Truth Social (@TrumpDailyPosts) February 19, 2025 Trump also repeated his accusations about U.S. aid for Ukraine. Zelensky 'talked the United States of America into spending $350 Billion Dollars, to go into a War that couldn’t be won, that never had to start, but a War that he, without the U.S. and ‘TRUMP,’ will never be able to settle. The United States has spent $200 Billion Dollars more than Europe, and Europe’s money is guaranteed, while the United States will get nothing back.' Those figures, however, contradict information compiled by the Kiel Institute For The World Econonmy’s Ukraine Support Tracker. Those figures show that Europe – counted as the sum of the EU and individual member states – has allocated $137.9 billion in help for Ukraine, which is more than the nearly $119 billion from the U.S. More than half of the U.S. aid to Ukraine - $66.5 billion - was for direct security assistance in the form of donated weapons, according to Pentagon figures. Data compiled by the Kiel Institute shows Europe outpaced the U.S. in aid to Ukraine. (Kiel Institute) U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance echoed Trump's sentiments. 'The idea that Zelensky is going to change the president's mind by badmouthing him in public media, everyone who knows the President will tell you that is an atrocious way to deal with this administration,' Vance told the Daily Mail.

'Unfortunately, President Trump – I have great respect for him as a leader of a nation that we have great respect for, the American people who always support us – unfortunately lives in this disinformation space,' Zelensky told reporters in Kyiv. 'I wish Trump’s team had more truth. Because none of this is having a positive effect on Ukraine.' Ukraine President Zelenskyy said U.S. President Trump is living in a Russian 'disinformation space' regarding his previous day’s comments about the Ukrainian leader’s approval rating.Trump said at Mar-a-Lago that Zelenskyy’s rating stood at 4%. The Associated Press (@AP) February 19, 2025 Zelensky was reacting to Trump's suggestion that he was not a legitimate leader and only had a 4% approval rating. 'As we are talking about the 4% [approval rating for me] we have seen this information,' Zelensky explained. 'We understand it is coming from Russia. We understand that and we have proof that these numbers are being discussed between America and Russia.' He did not share that proof, however, according to the latest research published by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, 57% of Ukrainians trust Zelensky. 'This morning, KIIS published a poll showing 57% trust in me. So if someone wants to replace me right now – it won’t work,' – Zelensky. The President added that the disinformation about 4% comes from Russia, which spread this narrative to the Americans. pic.twitter.com/BehR1G6xTv&mdash; NOELREPORTS (@NOELreports) February 19, 2025 Zelensky also lashed out at Trump’s comment that Ukraine started the war, as well as the agreement struck between the U.S. and Russia paving the path toward a peace deal. That four-point plan seeks greater cooperation between Moscow and Washington and subsequent comments by top U.S. negotiators suggested Ukraine might have to give up territory without reciprocal concessions by Russia. 'They are letting Putin out of isolation and I think Putin and the Russian people are very happy, because they are involved in discussions and yesterday there were signals that they are the victims. That is something new.' Even former Vice President Mike Pence weighed in to support Zelensky, offering a public reminder on social media that Russia started the war on Feb. 24, 2022. 'Mr. President, Ukraine did not 'start' this war,' Pence said on X. 'Russia launched an unprovoked and brutal invasion claiming hundreds of thousands of lives. The Road to Peace must be built on the Truth.' Mr. President, Ukraine did not 'start' this war. Russia launched an unprovoked and brutal invasion claiming hundreds of thousands of lives.

'It's disgusting to see an American president turn against one of our friends and openly side with a thug like [Russian President] Vladimir Putin,' Schumer stated on the Senate floor. 'It is shameful to hear the president repeat Putin’s propaganda while laying the groundwork for negotiations that favor Russia at Ukraine’s expense.'

'‘Trump isn’t even trying to hide his irritation with Zelensky,’ the Rossiya channel said at the top of its newscast, according to the wire service. 'Trump steamrolled Zelensky for his complaints about the talks with Russia,' the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda said, AP added. Ultra-nationalistic Russian philosopher Alexander Dugin also expressed joy over the angry discourse between the American and Ukrainian leaders. 'Checkmate,' he stated on X. 'Zelensky and his regime is over. Now he will be betrayed literally by everybody. Terrible destiny - to lose all - power, country, esteem, soul (if there was any), respect. And soon life I presume.' Checkmate. Zelensky and his regime is over. Now he will be betrayed literally by everybody. Terrible destiny - to loose all - power, country, esteem, soul (if there was any), respect. And soon life I presume.&mdash; Alexander Dugin (@AGDugin) February 19, 2025 As for Ukrainian support for the war, 'the data shows that support for continuing the fight for victory among Ukrainians has decreased since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in February 2022,' the Ukrainian SIC-Group polling company told us. 'At that time, 73% of respondents preferred fighting for victory. In 2023, this number dropped to 63%, and by 2024, there has been a noticeable increase in war fatigue among the population.' However, 'it is important to emphasize that this does not mean support for peace talks between the U.S. and Russia without Ukraine’s participation,' SIC-Group explained. 'Representatives of Ukrainian civil society strongly condemn such negotiations, stressing that any agreements about Ukraine without its direct involvement are unacceptable and contrary to international law.' Putin, meanwhile, offered his own take on the peace process. He said that Kyiv is not being cut out of the peace talks. Offering a readout of his previous conversation with Trump, Putin confirmed that he was told Ukraine would be part of any negotiations.

Massive WWII B-29 Bomber Base Fully Reclaimed For Future Pacific ...	Satellite imagery shows the extent of the massive amount of work that has been done in the past year to restore more than 20 million square feet of runways and other World War II-era infrastructure at historic North Field on the U.S. island of Tinian in the Western Pacific. The airfield was originally established as a launchpad for B-29 bomber raids on Imperial Japan, including the ones that saw atomic bombs dropped on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The facility has been refurbished to again offer a critical power projection node with its original grid-like layout presenting targeting challenges for a modern opponent, all of which could be especially valuable in a future high-end fight in the region against China. A series of satellite images of North Field taken between December 3, 2023, and January 29, 2025, by Planet Labs starkly illustrates just how extensive the reconstitution of the derelict airfield has become. The images, as can seen below, show the progressive clearing of the previously overgrown runways, taxiways, and other infrastructure. PHOTO © 2025 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Tinian's North Field as seen in a satellite image taken on January 29, 2025. PHOTO © 2025 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Additional satellite imagery from Planet Labs shows the ongoing work to expand Tinian International Airport further to the south of North Field, which is also to support U.S. military operations in the region. As seen below, a very large new apron and adjacent taxiway are being built to the north of the airport's existing runway. Additional infrastructure, including new fuel storage facilities at Tinian's main port at the south end of the island, is also included in the divert field project, as you can read more about here.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION The U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force have been working together on the military construction across Tinian. Tinian is one of the 14 islands that comprise the U.S. Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). It is situated in the Western Pacific some 120 miles northeast of Guam, which is another U.S. territory, but is not part of the CNMI. A map showing the general location of Tinian, at left, with Guam directly to its south. Wake Island, at center, and Hawaii, at right, are also marked. Google Maps At the height of operations in 1945, North Field had four 8,500-foot-long runways and associated taxiways, ramp space for more than 500 B-29s, and other facilities to support the approximately 40,000 personnel stationed at the base, according to the U.S. National Park Service (NPS). U.S. Navy construction battalions, better known as Seabees, led the work to enlarge what had been a far smaller Japanese airfield following the island's capture in 1944. North Field seen during World War II. This picture was taken before the fourth runway was built. US Army Air Force 'Because the shape of the island was reminiscent of Manhattan, New York, the Seabees laid it out in a pattern, and with place names, based on the city streets there,' per NPS. By the time World War II ended, North Field was the largest airfield anywhere in the world. However, the massive drawdown that followed the conclusion of the war led what was then the U.S. Army Air Force to completely abandon the facility in 1947 and it sat largely idle for the next five decades. A picture of North Field on Tinian in 1945. US Government The U.S. military did some much more modest work to restore parts of North Field in the 2000s and 2010s to expand its utility for training purposes. The extent of this was using one of its runway areas as a semi-improved landing strip and an area for austere forward-deployed operations training. A satellite image taken in June 2023 showing the more modest refurbishments at North Field. Google Earth A US Marine Corps KC-130J tanker/transport aircraft lands at North Field on Tinian during an exercise in 2024. USMC Sgt. Jose Angeles By 2020, the decision had been made to make the aforementioned improvements to Tinian International Airport, located south of North Field, primarily to expand its ability to serve as a divert field, especially in case Andersen Air Force Base on nearby Guam is put out of action for any reason. By the end of 2023, the U.S. military had decided to reclaim all of North Field, as well. The Air Force highlighted what it described as the 'adaptive rehabilitation work being done on the North Field' in a press release last April. 'The Airmen [on the island] there are restoring over 20 million square feet of degraded World War II pavement so that ultimately the rejuvenated runway can serve as a power projection platform.' 'Our Airmen at Tinian are successfully expanding our Agile Combat Employment options to enhance deterrence, increase flexibility, and, if needed, rapidly generate combat power,' Chief of Staff of the Air Force Gen. David W. Allvin said in a statement at the time. 'They are the pathfinders for advancing our scheme of maneuver in the Indo-Pacific.' Agile Combat Employment (ACE) refers to a set of concepts of operations the Air Force has been refining for several years now that are heavily centered on short notice and otherwise irregular deployments, often to non-traditional and austere locales. Expanding available operating locations, including similar work to refurbish Northwest Field on Guam, as well as new camouflage, concealment, and deception capabilities, are also important elements of ACE. The core idea is to reduce vulnerability by upending enemy targeting and other planning cycles. A US Air Force F-22 Raptor stealth fighter at Tinian International Airport during an ACE-focused exercise in 2024. USAF Tech. Sgt. Curt Beach Concerns about the availability of large established facilities, especially in any future high-end conflict in the Pacific against China, wherein facilities like Andersen on Guam would be prime targets, have been key drivers behind ACE. Other branches of the U.S. military, especially the U.S. Marine Corps, have been developing their own new expeditionary and distributed concepts of operations for the same general reasons. Within this context, a heated debate has also emerged about whether or not the U.S. military should be doing more to physically harden bases against attack. The Air Force, in particular, has largely pushed back against passive hardening in favor of active air and missile defenses and ACE. A huge new air defense architecture is being established in Guam in line with this broader strategy. This is despite global trends going in the opposite direction on hardening, especially in China, as you can more about here. A US Air Force F-16 Viper fighter sits inside a hardened aircraft shelter. No such shelters are currently present on Tinian. USAF Rehabilitating North Field on Tianian provides not just an additional operating location, but one that is also inherently more difficult for an opponent to target. An enemy would have to devote significant resources to ensure the disruption, let alone destruction, of the facility and its runways. Andersen on Guam, an absolutely strategically critical location for U.S. air operations in the Western Pacific located to the South of Tinian is a similarly sprawling facility. Still, in December, the Henry L. Stimson Center think tank published a report highlighting the danger posed by Chinese missile strikes aimed just at cratering runways to hobble flight operations at key U.S. bases in the Pacific. Aircraft operating from North Field could also regularly move between different parking spots at the base's grid-like apron, which would make it far harder for an enemy to achieve maximum destruction by targeting just one section. In a report released in January, the Hudson Institute think tank assessed that just 10 missiles with warheads capable of scattering cluster munitions across areas 450 feet in diameter could be sufficient to neutralize all exposed aircraft on the ground, as well as, fuel storage facilities at U.S. airbases like Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni in Japan, Naval Support Facility Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, or Langley Air Force Base in Virginia. All of this also highlights the growing interest in new runway-independent aircraft, crewed and uncrewed, across the U.S. military. Short and vertical takeoff and landing designs could make use of the restored North Field, as well. Underscoring this, U.S. Marine Corps short-takeoff and vertical landing capable F-35B Joint Strike Fighters forward-based in Japan conducted a routine training deployment to Tinian International Airport in January. US Marine Corps F-35B Joint Strike Fighters on Tinian in January 2025. USMC Lance Cpl. Dahkareo Pritchett The U.S. military also uses mobile arresting gear systems to provide critical safety margins for tactical jets operating from shorter runways, including at remote and austere locations like North Field. Defense contractor General Atomics has gone a step further in proposing the adaptation of the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) catapults and Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG) it originally developed for the U.S. Navy's Ford class aircraft carriers to support flight operations on land. North Field is one of a number of other airfields being readied in the Western Pacific for combat aircraft to operate out of should a war with China erupt, and it appears to be the largest by a good margin. While they are in no way hardened from enemy attacks, having so many airfields as potential operating areas deeply complicates the enemy's targeting process and puts a strain on precious resources, notably standoff weaponry, that would be used to attack American airpower, where it is most vulnerable, on the ground.

Zelensky Decries Peace Talks Without Ukraine, Trump Says He Had H...	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky complained that peace talks about Ukraine are taking part without his country's participation and seemingly to Russia's benefit. Speaking to reporters after the U.S. and Russia wrapped up the first sessions of negotiations to stop the nearly three-year-old war, Zelensky said he wants the conflict to end, 'but we want it to be fair and that no one decides anything behind our backs.' Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump seemed to blame Ukraine for not seeking an earlier peace deal and sided with the Russian position that Zelensky should face new elections. 'You cannot make decisions without Ukraine on how to end the war in Ukraine, on any conditions,' he stated after meeting with Turkish President Recep Erdogan. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, who hosted the talks in Riyadh, originally invited Zelensky to take part in the meeting. However, both the U.S. and Russia objected, according to Bloomberg, citing sources. 'Prince Mohammed had wanted Zelenskiy to be represented at the talks but both the Americans and the Russians had insisted that they wanted to meet without the Ukrainians, according to a person with knowledge of the Saudi preparations.' Status-6 (Military & Conflict News) (BlueSky too) (@Archer83Able) February 18, 2025 Tuesday afternoon, U.S. President Donald Trump dismissed concerns that Ukraine has not had a seat at the table during the negotiations, essentially blaming Kyiv for not negotiating a way out of the war earlier. 'They're upset about not having a seat, well, they've had a seat for three years, and a long time before that,' Trump told reporters Tuesday afternoon. 'This could have been settled very easily&#8230;' Trump’s message to Ukrainians who feel let down by his administration:'I hear they're upset about not having a seat. Well, they've had a seat for three years.' pic.twitter.com/Gz4GHiawYT&mdash; Polymarket Intel (@PolymarketIntel) February 18, 2025 Trump echoed comments earlier in the day by a top U.S. negotiator who pushed back on the notion that Ukraine and European allies are being left out of this process. 'If you’re going to bring both sides together, you have to talk to both sides,' said U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, who took part in the Riyadh peace talks. 'And we’ll continue to remind everyone literally within minutes of President Trump hanging up with President Putin he called and spoke with President Zelensky. So shuttle diplomacy has happened throughout history, it’s happened all over the world. We are absolutely talking to both sides.' Waltz was part of high-ranking delegations from Washington and Moscow that met for nearly five hours in the Saudi capital to find a way to end the conflict. They came away with a four-point agreement focused mostly on improving U.S.-Russian relations that badly deteriorated after Russia’s all-out invasion of Ukraine nearly three years ago. It called for normalizing bilateral relations, creating 'high-level' teams to find a way to end the war 'as quickly as possible,' laying the groundwork for future bilateral political and economic agreements and pleading to keep the peace process moving forward. The four points were drastically different from positions Rubio held while a U.S. Senator before becoming Secretary of State. The four points of the agreement reached between Russia and the U.S. today. (U.S. State Department) The talks, led by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, were a stunning turnaround from the stance Washington held under the Biden administration. After Russia launched its full-on invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, then-President Joe Biden organized an international effort to isolate Russian President Vladimir Putin and impose harsh economic sanctions on his country. Today’s agreement opens the door to reversing that. 'Should this conflict come to an acceptable end, the incredible opportunities that exist to partner with the Russians, geopolitically on issues of common interest, and frankly economically on issues that hopefully will be good for the world and will also improve our relations in the long term between these two important countries,' Rubio told reporters in Riyadh after the talks wrapped up. Rubio's comments caused consternation among allies. The negotiations were held without Russia offering any concessions and as U.S. relations with Europe are plummeting in the wake of the Trump administration's sudden foreign policy shifts.

'There are sanctions that were imposed as a result of this conflict. And so I would say to you that in order to bring an end to any conflict there has to be concessions made by all sides,' Rubio explained. 'We’re not going to predetermine what those are. We’re certainly not going to negotiate this today or in a press conference for that matter.' Any future deal will also involve a discussion about Ukrainian territory seized by Russia, said Waltz. 'We know just the practical reality is that there is going to be some discussion of territory and there is going to be a discussion of security guarantees,' he stated. That territory could conceivably include not just land Russia captured, which is about 20% of Ukraine including Crimea, but territory it annexed from four Ukrainian regions which is even larger. Waltz said that is on the table as well. 'I think that those are things to be discussed,' he told reporters.

'I have reason to believe that the American side has started to better understand our position,' the Russian foreign minister said. That position may be just a stalling tactic, intelligence officials and political leaders told NBC News. '&#8230;intelligence from the United States and close allies shows that Russian President Vladimir Putin still wants to control all of Ukraine,' the network reported, citing four Western intelligence officials and two U.S. congressional officials. 'We have zero intelligence that Putin is interested in a real peace deal right now,' one of the congressional officials said. 'He thinks he’s winning,' one of the Western intelligence officials said, adding that Russian losses on the battlefield are not pressuring Putin to stop fighting. No way!

French President Emmanuel Macron is planning a second meeting, scheduled for Wednesday, to find ways to guarantee Ukraine’s security, Reuters reported. Additional European nations and Canada were invited to take part. That follows a meeting held in Paris on Monday seeking commitments for a European peacekeeping force on the ground in Ukraine to bolster any successful negotiation to end the war. The meeting ended without a consensus. Foreign troops on Ukrainian soil after a peace deal is a non-starter, Lavrov said. 'The presence of troops from NATO countries, whether under foreign flags, EU flags, or their own national flags, does not change anything. This is, of course, unacceptable to us,' the Russian foreign minister exclaimed.

The Russian ambassador called Zelensky 'the self-proclaimed Ukrainian president' and referred to his government as 'the Zelensky cabal,' saying that neither had 'a role to play in the new Ukraine.' However, Zelensky won the second round of Ukraine’s 2019 presidential election in a landslide and there have been no elections because the country is under martial law and voting has been considered logistically unfeasible and challenging after so many residents fled the war. Despite that, Trump seemed to concede that Nebenzya's point as well Tuesday afternoon. Zelensky wants 'a seat at the table&#8230; but the people of Ukraine have to say, like, 'you know, it's been a long time since we've had an election,'' Trump told reporters. 'That's not a Russia thing. That's something coming from me and coming from many other countries also.' REPORTER: 'We're hearing that Russia wants to force Ukraine as a condition for a peace deal.

'Today is the first step of a long and difficult journey but an important one,' he explained, heaping praise on Trump for being 'the only leader in the world that could initiate that process.' No date has yet been set on when Ukraine will get a seat at the negotiating table. Clearly angered, Zelensky said he expects a delegation led by Trump peace envoy Keith Kellogg to arrive in Kyiv on Thursday. However, it remains to be seen whether that visit will make the Ukrainian leader any more reassured about how this peace process will play out.

Ukraine’s Black MiG-29 'Ghost' Fulcrum Showcased In New Video	Since at least the summer of last year, the Ukrainian Air Force has been flying an unusual, black-painted MiG-29 Fulcrum. A recently published official video shows the jet in more detail, although it remains unclear exactly why it was repainted in this way. The footage was posted to Facebook on the official account of the Ukrainian Air Force’s 204th Tactical Aviation Brigade. The aircraft is shown from above, as well as filmed on the ground surrounded by various support vehicles (of Soviet and Western origin) as well as members of the various personnel groups who support the brigade’s wartime operations.

There are also blue and yellow markings on the wing leading edges, the flaps and ailerons, and the tailplanes. These are to provide a rapid visual identification, to try and avoid ‘friendly fire’ incidents. This is especially critical for this jet as many Russian tactical jets also adopt a charcoal gray color scheme. The nose also has a white ‘Ghost Of Kyiv’ emblem — this motif appeared early on in the conflict as a morale-booster. An overhead view of the MiG-29 together with support vehicles, including a U.S.-supplied Humvee. Ukrainian Air Force What’s far less clear is why the fighter otherwise wears overall black, although the jet is known to have emerged before August 2024, when photos of the repainted MiG began to circulate on social media. One of the first photos of the black MiG, which emerged last summer, showing the jet before the blue and yellow identification panels were added. via X Another early photo of the black MiG, now with the blue and yellow identification panels applied. via X The new paint was added after an overhaul, which is standard Ukrainian Air Force practice, although the black scheme seems to be an anomaly. So far, it’s only been seen on the MiG-29, but more than one of these aircraft may have received it by now. Otherwise, most MiG-29s have emerged from in-depth overhauls with different variations of the ‘pixelated’ camouflage, with different shades of gray. Photographed pre-war, a two-seat MiG-29UB with the ‘pixelated’ camouflage applied after an in-depth overhaul. Ukrainian Air Force It’s worth noting that there have been a handful of other special MiG-29 schemes for refurbished jets, as well, most notably the highly colorful one inspired by the pre-war Ukrainian Falcons display team, which you can see in the video below and read more about here. It seems the patriotic paintwork was added primarily as a morale booster, reflecting the continued ability of the Ukrainian Air Force to fight against overwhelming odds, and of the local maintenance, repair, and overhaul facilities to keep the MiGs serviceable, even when facing Russian attacks. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, dozens of combat aircraft (also Su-24s, Su-27, and Su-27s) have been refurbished and returned to service to help address attrition losses and the demands for additional airpower. At least some of these were returned to action after long periods standing dormant or in storage. Photographed pre-war, a MiG-29 heads for an in-depth overhaul after a long period inactive. Ukrainian Air Force The MiG-29 fleet has been further boosted by aircraft transferred from Poland and Slovakia, which began to arrive in the spring and summer of 2023. These aircraft have retained their previous colors, with the addition of blue and yellow identification panels. While the pixelated gray colors are optimized to reduce visual conspicuity during daytime sorties, the black scheme would appear to have the opposite effect — making the aircraft even more obvious against the sky. Indeed, the U.K. Royal Air Force paints its training aircraft in (gloss) black specifically to enhance their visual signatures and reduce the chances of collisions. On the other hand, the dramatic-looking black Fulcrum finish may be more connected to the mythical Ghost of Kyiv legend — the popular accounts told early on in the conflict that suggested a single Ukrainian MiG-29 pilot had become ace in a day in defense of the capital. There were rumors, later proven to be erroneous, that the Ghost might have been Stepan Tarabalka, a MiG-29 pilot killed in action in March 2022 and posthumously awarded Hero of Ukraine honors. On March 13, 2022, Major Stepan Tarabalka died heroically during an air battle with the dominant forces of the russian invaders.Major Stepan Tarabalka was awarded the title of 'Hero of Ukraine' (posthumously) for the protection of airspace, his bravery and commitment. pic.twitter.com/8ZI7Mtugvs&mdash; Ukrainian Air Force (@KpsZSU) March 25, 2022 A photo of the supposed pilot was even posted to social media by former Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko. It later emerged that the pilot in that photo was Andrii Pilshchykov, the MiG-29 pilot better known by the callsign 'Juice,' who gave several in-depth interviews about the air war to TWZ. Before his death in a flying accident, Juice had told us: 'Actually, [the Ghost of Kyiv is] from my home base, my unit … I couldn’t tell you all the details now, but I think after the victory you will know everything about him.' Andrii Pilshchykov in the cockpit of a MiG-29, in a photo widely shared as showing the supposed Ghost of Kyiv. Ukrainian Air Force While Juice maintained that at least some details of the Ghost of Kyiv story were grounded in reality, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense has admitted that the idea of a single pilot filling this role is a 'superhero legend,' and that the story 'embodies the collective spirit of the highly qualified pilots.' Clearly, the idea of an avenging MiG-29 pilot sweeping Russian aircraft from the skies, and becoming a national hero in the process, is a potent one, and the Ghost of Kyiv myth has endured, as seen in the use of the emblem on jets and crew patches, for example. It’s certainly very possible that the 204th Tactical Aviation Brigade took the decision to paint a single MiG-29 in a ghostly black scheme to continue that myth. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Air Force does have something of a history of painting jets in less-than-standard color schemes. At this point, we don’t know for sure but have asked the service for more details. Meanwhile, despite the arrival of the F-16, the MiG-29 is still the service’s most numerous fighter, by a fairly considerable margin, compared with other types. While it began the war flying almost exclusively air defense sorties, the arrival of Western-supplied precision-guided munitions means it’s now a multirole fighter and it has been widely used for offensive missions. For these, it can be armed with the AGM-88 High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM), the Joint Direct Attack Munition-Extended Range (JDAM-ER), and the French-supplied Hammer rocket-assisted bomb. While the exact reasoning behind the all-black MiG-29 remains mysterious for now, there is little doubt that the Soviet-era fighter remains a very important asset for the Ukrainian Air Force and one that every effort will be made to keep in service via continued refurbishment, even as western 4th generation F-16 and Mirage 2000 fighters trickle into the service's tactical jet fleet. As that continues, we may well see other unorthodox color schemes emerge too.

CIA MQ-9 Reaper Drones Are Covertly Spying On Mexican Drug Cartel...	The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is reportedly flying unarmed MQ-9 Reapers inside Mexican airspace to snoop on drug cartels. The overflights are said to have built off of a covert CIA drone surveillance program focused on finding labs producing the narcotic Fentanyl inside Mexico that began under President Joe Biden. The use of Reapers, which are capable of being armed, comes amid talk of unprecedented direct action by American forces against Mexico's cartels, operations that could include drone strikes as TWZ previously highlighted in an in-depth feature. CNN first reported the CIA MQ-9 flights over Mexico earlier today. The exact size of the agency's Reaper fleet and how those drones may be configured compared to ones in service elsewhere, including with the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), is unknown. Current generation Reapers can stay aloft for more than a day at a time depending on their configuration and loadout. MQ-9s can carry an array of precision-guided bombs and missiles, as well as a wide variety of sensors internally and in underwing pods, along with other stores. There is also considerable evidence of a very close working relationship when it comes to drone operations between the CIA and the U.S. military's secretive Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), as well as Air Force Special Operations Command. An example of a US Air Force MQ-9 Reaper armed with Hellfire missiles and also carrying a range-extending external fuel tank. Air National Guard 'The &#8230; flights were communicated to Congress by the Trump administration using a particular notification reserved for new or updated covert programs that the CIA intends either to conceal or deny, a source familiar with the matter said — suggesting that the flights represent a distinct escalation,' according to CNN. 'The notifications made no mention of Mexican partners, the source said.' TWZ has reached out to the CIA and the Mexican Embassy in Washington, D.C. for more information. 'The CIA has flown surveillance drones to hunt cartels inside Mexico before, according to a former and a current U.S. official, under at least one small program that partnered with Mexican authorities,' the report added. It is interesting to note here that CBP has, at least in the past, flown its unarmed Reapers, which it refers to as Predator B drones, inside Mexican airspace in cooperation with that country's government. 'CBP also uses Predator B aircraft to perform bi-national law enforcement operations with the government of Mexico through coordination at the Information Analysis Center located at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City, Mexico,' according to a 2017 report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO), a Congressional watchdog. 'We found that 7 percent of Predator B flight hours from fiscal years 2013 through 2016 were in foreign airspace located in Mexico or 1,615 flight hours.' A pair of CBP MQ-9 Reaper, or Predator B, drones. CBP A separate report today from The New York Times does not mention the use of MQ-9s, specifically, but provides additional context about CIA drone flights over Mexico. 'The United States has stepped up secret drone flights over Mexico to hunt for fentanyl labs, part of the Trump administration’s more aggressive campaign against drug cartels, according to U.S. officials,' according to that report. 'The covert drone program, which has not been previously disclosed, began under the Biden administration, according to U.S. officials and others familiar with the program.' 'C.I.A. officers in Mexico pass information collected by the drones to Mexican officials,' the Times' story adds. 'The drones have proved adept at identifying labs, according to people with knowledge of the program. Fentanyl labs emit chemicals that make them easy to find from the air.' The ability of aerial platforms to use multi-spectral imaging capabilities to detect chemical plumes is not new, as TWZ has reported on in the past. A side-by-side example of a traditional image captured by an aerial platform and one of the same spot taken using a multi-spectral camera showing chemical plumes not visible to the naked eye. National Guard Bureau via FOIA Depending on their exact sensor configuration, CIA drones, including MQ-9s, would be able to gather other kinds of data via cameras and radars, as well as collect signals intelligence, such as communications chatter between cartel members. Uncrewed aircraft could also use sensors to geolocate emitters like radios and cellphones and otherwise track the movements of targets of interest. This, in turn, could be used to help establish so-called 'patterns of life' for a specific individual or group of individuals. That data can then be used to further refine intelligence-gathering efforts, as well as support the planning and execution of targeted raids or strikes. The U.S. military and the U.S. Intelligence community have honed the ability to use sensor-packed aircraft, crewed and uncrewed, to find and fix often hard-to-locate targets after two decades of counter-terrorism operations. These skill sets continue to be actively demonstrated in places like Syria on a regular basis. Northrop Grumman's AN/ZPY-5 Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar (VADER), which has flown on CBP Reapers and certain U.S. military aircraft, is just one particularly prime example of relevant known available sensor capabilities. VADER is a fast-scanning active electronically-scanned array (AESA) radar with ground moving target indicator (GMTI) with synthetic aperture radar imaging (SAR) modes. It can produce high-quality map-like images even through cloud cover, smoke, and dust, and also at night. Objects detected using the GMTI functionality can be overlaid on those images and changes in their positions can be tracked from one scan to the next. A view of the feed from VADER. DHS There have been previous reports, including one from The Washington Post just yesterday, about President Donald Trump's administration directing the CIA to take a larger role in the counter-drug fight south of the border, in general. The U.S. military has already publicly acknowledged an increase in aerial intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) activity on its end involving crewed aircraft in support of counter-drug and border security operations. This has involved flights in U.S. airspace along the southern border, as well as in international airspace around Mexico. 'We've &#8230; increased some uniquely military capabilities that will get after the point you make, the cartels, which are driving illegal migration, and that's primarily through airborne ISR to get more information on those and figure out how we can counter their actions,' U.S. Air Force Gen. Gregory Guillot told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee at a hearing last week. U.S. Navy P-8A Posiedon and Air Force RC-135V/W Rivet Joint aircraft have been tracked conducting these flights, as TWZ has previously reported. A separate past report from CNN says that U-2S Dragon Lady spy planes have been utilized, as well. A stock photo of a US Air Force RC-135V/W Rivet Joint, one of the highly capable US military crewed intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft now being actively used to surveil Mexico. USAF 'We have a number of intel analysts that work with &#8230; lead federal agencies to provide intelligence that gets after the cartel networks that drive the production and distribution of Fentanyl and pushes it across the border,' Guillot also said during last week's hearing. In addition, 'we do have intelligence sharing with Mexico to show them what we see.' TWZ has previously highlighted how the use of more capable and strategic-focused aerial ISR platforms, especially the Rivet Joint, already represented a significant new development in operations around Mexico. The reported covert CIA drone flights inside Mexican airspace, especially if they are being conducted without any cooperation or coordination with authorities in that country, is another major escalatory step. 'It's part of this little campaign,' Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said today in response to questions about the reported CIA drone flights, but did not elaborate. Earlier this month, Sheinbaum directed the deployment of 10,000 additional military personnel to the border with the United States to help with counter-drug operations. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. YURI CORTEZ/AFP via Getty Images YURI CORTEZ 'We cannot rule out espionage because we do not know exactly what was done,' Mexican Defense Minister Ricardo Trevilla said last week about the U.S. military's increased aerial ISR activity in U.S. and international airspace around his country. Today's reports from CNN and The New York Times both stress that the CIA drones flying over Mexico are not currently armed and that there are no immediate plans to use them to conduct strikes. However, the news can only prompt additional discussions about whether it might be a prelude to U.S. direct action against the cartels from the air and/or on the ground. The Trump administration is also working toward formally designating at least some of Mexico's drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, which would expand the scope of actions that U.S. authorities could take against them. Any direct action targeting Mexican drug cartels, especially without a new level of cooperation and trust with the Mexican government, would have major ramifications on both sides of the border. Striking any target from the air in a neighboring country you are not otherwise at war is a major escalation and it's unclear if the Trump administration will end up going that route. However, collecting key intelligence, including from covert CIA MQ-9 flights, would be a first step. As TWZ has previously wrote: 'Trump’s first option would likely be airstrikes — with drones and/or standoff weapons being the most likely choice — for several reasons.' 'As we have previously reported, Mexico’s increasingly well-armed drug cartels pose a serious threat to external forces. Some cartel units are extremely well-equipped and have adopted some of the latest features of warfare. They have been using drones to attack enemies for years now, for instance.' This is terrifying.

'Cartels can also have defacto control over large areas with lots of support at the ready. Inner circles around key drug lords are among the most heavily defended and fortified positions in these areas, which makes them challenging targets. But the same ‘find and fix’ tactics that have been used to take out terrorists in the Middle East, especially with the help of drones, could potentially be brought to bear to help solve that problem. Unless Mexico agrees to their employment, they would not be operating in totally permissible airspace. While Mexico’s air defenses are extremely rudimentary, this could still be an issue.' 'Any sort of ground raid without prior authority from Mexico raises the concern that any U.S. troops inadvertently left behind or otherwise captured could be without legal protection. That’s why U.S. military deployments frequently take place with Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs) giving military personnel and civilian contractors protection from being subject to unfair criminal or civil justice systems.' &#8230; 'While far less risky to U.S. troops, the downside of relying solely on airpower is the loss of valuable intelligence U.S. forces could gather on the ground to rapidly exploit, as they did in Afghanistan and Iraq.' Details about existing U.S. military activities on the ground in Mexico, understood to primarily revolve around advise and assist and training support type missions, are limited. Members of the U.S. Army's 7th Special Forces Group (Airborne) reportedly just recently deployed to the country to help train members of the Mexican Marine Crops through the end of March. Mexico's Marines have now long been among the country's military units most heavily committed to the counter-drug fight. Whatever the Trump administration's exact plans to go after the cartels might be, the CIA already looks to have taken a leading role, including with its reported covert drone flights.

Army’s Stinger Surface-To-Air Missile Replacement Makes Progress	The U.S. Army’s ongoing effort to field a successor to the FIM-92 Stinger man-portable air defense system (MANPADS) has seen a series of successful subsystem demonstrations, with the next step planning to put the system into troops’ hands for field evaluation. The latest demonstrations as part of the Army’s Next-Generation Short-Range Interceptor program (NGSRI) were carried out by RTX’s Raytheon business unit. The need to field a replacement for the aging Stinger has been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, which has seen the United States transfer thousands of the older missiles, while the drone threat has continued to grow globally. Raytheon announced today that it had completed all 10 planned subsystem demonstrations for its NGSRI entrant over the past several months. Members of the U.S. Army fire Stinger missile. U.S. Department of Defense Members of the US Army fire a Stinger missile. DOD These successful subsystem demonstrations are a crucial step in meeting the U.S. Army’s range and performance requirements for this transformational short-range air defense capability,' said Tom Laliberty, president of Land & Air Defense Systems at Raytheon. 'We are confident in our ability to rapidly deliver the Army an affordable, low-risk, highly producible NGSRI solution.' The company provided specific details of four of the subsystems that were looked at. First of these is the seeker assembly, which demonstrated a maximum acquisition range 'far exceeding Stinger in both laboratory and outdoor environments.' Meanwhile, the rocket motor 'demonstrated the ability to extend the intercept range of maneuver short-range air defense engagements.' As for the command launch assembly (CLA) — the man-portable missile launcher interface — this also demonstrated an 'enhanced range for operator detection and identification of aerial targets in real-world, low-visibility environments.' Finally, the warhead, which underwent static arena testing, demonstrated 'precise and repeatable lethality against a broad spectrum of aerial threats.'

Brienna Tuck A Marine fires a Stinger missile from a US Navy Mk VI patrol boat. USN The remaining six demonstrations addressed other critical functions of the new missile, including tracking, guidance, aerodynamic control, fuzing, and safety. The success of the subsystem demonstrations, Raytheon says, should lead to exercises in which U.S. Army soldiers and Marines will get their hands on NGSRI prototypes and test them in exercises. It seems likely these trials won’t involve troops actually firing the missiles — at least, not yet. Raytheon said a first system flight test demonstration is only planned for later this year. A replacement for the venerable Stinger short-range heat-seeking surface-to-air missile has been in the works for some time now, as TWZ has reported in the past, with the original plan being to get a finalized weapon into production no later than the 2027 Fiscal Year. The Army issued a formal request for information (RFI) for the proposed Stinger replacement in March 2022, at which time the program was known as Maneuver Short Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD) Increment 3. While other M-SHORAD increments focused on the development of air defense vehicles, Increment 3 was exclusively focused on developing a new missile to replace Stinger. A video showing a U.S. Army live-fire exercise with the M-SHORAD system on the Baltic Sea coast of Germany on October 7, 2021: According to that RFI, 'The system must be capable of defeating Rotary Wing (RW) aircraft, Group 2-3 Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), and Fixed Wing (FW) ground attack aircraft with capabilities equal to or greater than the current Stinger missile (with Proximity Fuse capability). The system must provide improved target acquisition with increased lethality and ranges over current capability.' At least some of those performance aspirations look to have been met in the recent subsystem demonstrations. We also know that the Army wants the new missile to be faster than the existing Stinger and more resistant to countermeasures. As well as being soldier-portable, the new missile is designed to be integrated on vehicles, via the existing Stinger Vehicle Universal Launcher (SVUL). This is a four-round launcher used on the M-SHORAD Increment 1 vehicle and the Avenger system, which can be mounted on a Humvee or in a static position. The rendering at the top of this article shows how Raytheon expects the new missile to appear when deployed in M-SHORAD-based and man-portable forms. A U.S. Army Humvee-based Avenger system with the two SVULs on its turret clearly visible. U.S. Army RTX and Lockheed Martin have both received contracts to competitively develop the Stinger replacement. Speaking in October 2023, Brig. Gen. Frank Lozano, who runs the Program Executive Office Missiles and Space, told Defense News that the service expected to spend the first two years of the program developing the missiles, which would be built in a 'very small quantity.' Then there would be a competitive fly-off, with the possibility that both RTX and Lockheed Martin entrants could progress to the second phase: a rapid prototyping effort. This will see improvements made to the missiles (or missiles) and another round of prototypes. After another fly-off round, if required, the service would look to start low-rate production — sometime before the end of 2028. The original drivers behind fielding a Stinger successor included the determination that the Stinger Reprogrammable Microprocessor (RMP) would become obsolete in Fiscal Year 2023, with the Stinger Block I meanwhile undergoing a life extension to keep it relevant. This upgrade includes the addition of a proximity fuze, making the missile more effective against smaller targets, such as drones. 'We found some ways to buy time in the near term, including, for example, refurbishing older Stinger missiles,' Army acquisition head Douglas Bush said in March 2023, during an online Defense News event. 'We think we’ll get at least 1,200 good new Stingers out of that effort, and save a lot of money doing it.' A very rudimentary breakdown of the core Stinger design. Raytheon At the same time, the Army’s Stinger inventory has been in decline for some time now, with a steady reduction due to normal training and test and evaluation requirements now compounded by the war in Ukraine. This has seen the U.S. military transfer thousands of these missiles to Ukraine, which has an urgent need for air defense equipment. The dwindling missile inventory in the United States across the board has led to broader questions about the feasibility of replenishing these stocks, or surging production if more missiles are required, as you can read more in this previous TWZ piece. As far as Stinger is concerned, the production of all-up missile rounds can no longer be undertaken, with all work now focusing on modernizing existing missiles. Ukrainian servicemen with a Stinger missile launcher on the front line in the Zaporizhzhia region. Photo by Andriy Andriyenko/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images SOPA Images All this taken together helped the Army decide to develop a Stinger replacement, although it’s still unclear exactly how much of the older Raytheon system might have made its way into that company’s NGSRI offering. Meanwhile, the conflict in Ukraine has only further underlined the need for more capable SHORAD capabilities for the U.S. military. In particular, the threat posed by small drones, which is very much a reality now and only continues to grow, has already shown the need for improved SHORAD systems, and in significant numbers. The generally parlous state of the U.S. military’s SHORAD enterprise is something we have discussed in this previous TWZ feature. All in all, while many details of the Next-Generation Short-Range Interceptor are still to be revealed, the program is fast-emerging as one of the most important for the U.S. military as it seeks to optimize its short-range air defense capabilities to better meet current and emerging threats.

Europe Debates Sending Troops To Ukraine	Leaders of several European nations met in Paris today to discuss whether to send troops to help bolster any deal to end the Ukraine war and if so, what they would do there. A lot of those decisions, however, depend on what kind of support, if any, the U.S. would provide. That’s if an agreement is even reached, which is still an open question. The French-led effort to ramp up ongoing discussions about committing boots on the ground was spurred by the Trump administration last week cutting Europe out of the negotiations. They are set to begin tomorrow in Saudi Arabia between Washington and Moscow. While not giving European nations a seat at the table, Trump has suggested they could play a peacekeeping role there. PM @Keir_Starmer joins President @EmmanuelMacron in #Paris for an informal meeting on #Ukraine & European security. pic.twitter.com/qFr3NzwuUt&mdash; French Embassy UK (@FranceintheUK) February 17, 2025 The Washington Post on Monday reported that European nations could contribute upwards of 30,000 troops 'who would not be stationed along the contact line but would stand ready as a show of force if Russian forces tried to restart the war,' the publication reported, citing four officials with knowledge of the plans. 'The troops could be backstopped by more forces outside Ukraine in case they need to ramp up and move quickly.' There is ongoing discussion between those nations and the Trump administration on what assets the U.S. would be willing to provide to back up any international force and what Europeans are willing to commit. While decrying Trump's move to leave them out of the negotiations, the European leaders say much of their planning is continngent on U.S. support. The U.S. has to date ruled out providing troops, though Trump's peace envoy Keith Kellogg on Monday suggested that 'the policy has always been that you take no options off the table,' Reuters reported. So far there have been few solid promises from European nations for that effort. European leaders planned to meet Monday on how they might influence talks that could determine the future of Ukraine and of Europe’s security landscape. The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) February 17, 2025 France 'has done more advanced military planning than others and estimates that it could commit nearly 10,000 troops,' the Post posited. On Sunday, U.K. Prime Minister Kier Starmer broached the possibility of contributing troops to any peacekeeping force in an opinion piece for the Telegraph. In addition to guaranteeing Ukraine 3 billion pounds per year (about $3.79 billion) in military aid through at least 2030. Starmer wrote that supporting Kyiv 'means being ready and willing to contribute to security guarantees to Ukraine by putting our own troops on the ground if necessary.' 'I do not say that lightly. I feel very deeply the responsibility that comes with potentially putting British servicemen and women in harm’s way. But any role in helping to guarantee Ukraine’s security is helping to guarantee the security of our continent, and the security of this country,' he explained without offering any specifics. UK PM Sir Keir Starmer says UK 'ready and willing' to put troops on the ground in Ukraine to help guarantee its security as part of a peace deal BBC Breaking News (@BBCBreaking) February 16, 2025 Sweden and the Netherlands were more vague about offering to send forces. Sweden said that it would not rule out sending troops to Ukraine if necessary, while the Netherlands is 'not negative' about European peacekeeping force in Ukraine. Germany, Poland and Spain each dismissed the possibility of sending troops, at least in the near term. 'Unfortunately we are still a long way off' from such a decision, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said, according to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, adding that 'it’s quite clear that a very strong Ukrainian army, even in peacetime, must be at the core' of any solution. Poland’s Prime Minister Donald Tusk offered a similar stance. Warsaw 'does not foresee sending Polish soldiers to Ukraine,' he told reporters before boarding a flight to Paris. 'Nobody is currently considering sending troops to Ukraine,' said José Manuel Albares, Spain’s foreign minister, according to Financial Times. 'Peace is still very far away and for one reason only: Vladimir Putin.' Albares added that any discussion of troop deployments or peacekeepers would 'have to consider for what mission, who will comprise it, under what flag, with what mandate.'

'I believe that this is the first platform for the future creation of such a force — the Armed Forces of Europe, such an army that will be able to respond in the sky, on water, on land, with drones in artificial intelligence, as well as in the event of a Russian offensive,' he said, adding that a foreign military presence does not necessarily mean troops stationed on Ukrainian soil but could include air defense systems and weapons to enhance security. All this depends on a peace deal, which is far from guaranteed. While the exact terms have yet to be announced, Trump administration officials painted some broad outlines last week. As we previously reported, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth cast doubt on Ukraine’s ability to reclaim the land lost since Russia first invaded in 2014. He also said membership in NATO was unlikely. Trump later concurred with both of those stances. In addition, Hegseth made it clear that while the Trump administration wants European and non-European troops to provide a security guarantee, those troops 'should be deployed as part of a non-NATO mission, and they should not be covered under Article Five [NATO charter of mutual aid]. There also must be robust international oversight of the line of contact to be clear as part of any security guarantee.' You can see Hegseth's comments in the following video. New US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says Ukraine becoming a NATO member or regaining all its pre-2014 territory is not realistic.Speaking at a meeting of the military alliance in Brussels, Hegseth said Washington would not deploy troops to Ukraine under any peace deal. pic.twitter.com/bI7c2ZON66&mdash; DW Europe (@dw_europe) February 12, 2025 Zelensky, adamant that his country won't agree to any deal that does not directly involve Ukraine, has complained that he was not invited to Saudi Arabia even though Trump promised he would be part of any negotiations. Zelensky has also been reluctant to give up all the roughly 20% of his nation in Russian hands. In Moscow, Russian Foreign Ministery Sergei Lavrov said that not only will Russia not accept any deal that cedes territory it has gained, but Moscow wants the entirety of four regions it illegally annexed. All this is posturing ahead of the negotiations. While so many pieces have to fall into place for a peace deal to be realized, this is the closest there has been to an end to the bloodshed, at least temporarily, since Russia launched its full-on invasion nearly three years ago.

AH-1Z Attack Helicopter’s New Long Range Missile Seen For The Fir...	The U.S. Navy has released a picture of a U.S. Marine Corps AH-1Z Viper attack helicopter with a previously unseen long-range munition armament. The Marines are known to be in the process of developing at least one new missile, the Precision Attack Strike Missile (PASM), to dramatically extend the range at which AH-1Zs can engage targets on land and at sea. The Corps sees this as key to ensuring the relevance of the helicopters in a future major conflict, especially one in the Pacific against China. Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) recently shared the image of the AH-1Z as part of an announcement about 'the Marine Corps [having] successfully executed its first live employment test of a new Long Range Precision Fire (LRPF) capability' last November. 'The event was successfully executed at Yuma Proving Grounds (YPG) in Yuma, AZ where an AH-1Z conducted [a] single launch by way of a wireless application via Marine Air-Ground Tablet (MAGTAB),' according to NAVAIR's release. 'The November test at YPG exceeded the threshold requirements with regards to position, navigation, and timing.' A wider view of the AH-1Z with the new munitions seen in the picture NAVAIR recently released. USN Though NAVAIR did not specifically name the Corps' PASM program, which evolved from an effort known as Long-Range Attack Missile (LRAM), it seems likely that what has been shown now is the first look at a missile developed through these efforts. 'This project is an Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD R&E) sponsored Defense Innovation Acceleration (DIA) project led by the XMA-ADT to evaluate cost-effective, long-range disparate effects in expeditionary and maritime environments,' according to the Navy release. XMA-ADT, which is housed within NAVAIR, has been directly involved in the LRAM/PASM work, as well as other advanced aviation projects. The 2025 Marine Aviation Plan, released earlier this month, also said that 'recently, PASM successfully completed its first launch from the AH-1Z.' It is also possible that the munitions seen in NAVAIR's recently released image are unrelated to LRAM/PASM. A slide from a 2024 briefing describing XMA-ADT's work, including on LRAM. USN/USMC The AH-1Z in the picture NAVAIR put out is armed with two of the munitions loaded one each onto the outboard pylons of the helicopter's stub wings via standard U.S. military triple ejector racks (TER) with large orange-colored fairings at their front. The Viper also has test instrumentation pods on its wingtip pylons, as well as a pair of fuel tanks under its stub wings. The missiles themselves each have an x-shaped tail fin arrangement and pop-out wings under their bodies. Though NAVAIR's image is of lower quality, the munitions also look to have a design intended to reduce its radar signature, at least from the front, with a prominent orange-colored section on the lower half of the front of the nose. This might be an aperture for a seeker, but is also unclear whether the image may have been edited in some way for operational security reasons. A look at the missile under the AH-1Z's right wing, attached via a triple ejector rack, as well as the drop tank under the stub wing and what may be a data point on the wing tip. USN NAVAIR also interestingly says that the test last year marked 'the first time a Marine Corps rotary-wing platform has employed a weapon system using a tablet-controlled device.' The aforementioned MAGTAB system is typically used by individual Marines on the ground or riding in aircraft for communications and other data-sharing purposes, including coordinating close air support, helping with route planning, and providing additional situational awareness. MAGTAB could be used to pass data from offboard sources to the AH-1Z about targets beyond the range its onboard sensors can 'see.' TWZ has previously pointed out that LRAM, at least, would require some kind of offboard cueing given the Viper's existing sensor capabilities. It is worth highlighting here that the U.S. military has also been using tablet-like devices to help with the rapid integration, in general, of new Western precision-guided munitions onto Ukraine's Soviet-era jets. A Marine riding in the back of a UH-1Y Venom armed light utility helicopter uses a Marine Air-Ground Tablet (MAGTAB) during a training exercise. USMC TWZ has reached out to NAVAIR and the Marines for more information. The Marine Corps has previously said that LRAM was leveraging an existing, but unspecified U.S. Air Force missile design. The Air Force has three projects ongoing, at least that we know about, which are centered on the development of new, more compact, and lower-cost air-launched precision-guided munitions with ranges in the hundreds of nautical miles. A number of designs with x-shaped tail fins and pop-out wings have already emerged from those efforts, though none appear to be clearly in line with the missiles seen on the AH-1Z in NAVAIR's recently released picture. A munition design with x-shaped tail fins and a pop-out wing from Leidos subsidiary Dynetics that the Air Force is testing in cooperation with the Defense Innovation Unit as part of the Enterprise Test Vehicle (ETV) program. Leidos Dynetics There is a possibility that any designs that the Marines explored through the LRAM effort, which is described as a Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) and dates back at least to 2023, are different from what service is now pursuing for PASM. As mentioned earlier, the munitions seen on the AH-1Z in the recent image from NAVAIR could be unrelated to LRAM/PASM entirely. The Navy has its own stated interest in new air-launched munitions in a somewhat similar category to LRAM/PASM. Private industry has been taking notice of the overall growing demand in this space, as well. Just in January, General Atomics teased a previously unseen air-launched 'Strike Missile' concept, which you can read more about here. An unpowered gliding munition, such as the GBU-53/B Small Diameter Bomb II, also known StormBreaker, which also has pop-out wings, could be another pathway to longer-range strike capability for Marine AH-1Zs. Published estimates of StormBreaker's maximum range vary, from 45 miles to upwards of 60 miles at maximum release height and speed from a fixed-wing aircraft. The development of powered derivatives of existing glide munitions is another growing trend globally. Regardless, extending the range at which AH-1Zs can engage their targets is a clear imperative for the Marines, especially in the context of planning around a potential future high-end fight in the Pacific against China. A new munition with a range of around 100 to 150 nautical miles would substantially increase the kinetic reach of the Viper. The AGM-114 Hellfires and AGM-179 Joint Air-to-Ground Missiles (JAGM) the Vipers can carry now have maximum ranges under 10 miles. Hellfires and JAGMs with tripled and doubled ranges, respectively have been tested, but still fall far short of what the Marines are looking at for LRAM/PASM. A US Marine Corps AH-1Z fires an AGM-179 JAGM during testing. USMC A Marine AH-1Z fires an AGM-179 Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM), one of the existing and much shorter-ranged missiles in its inventory. USMC 'I was a bit frustrated about the conversation they were having about what the next fight looks like. It was about a fight with a peer competitor and the distances we had over water with China and that H-1s were not going to be there,' Marine Col. Nathan Marvel told The War Zone in an interview back in 2023 laying out a case for the continued relevance of the AH-1Z, as well as the UH-1Y. 'I was like yes they are. Not only are we going to be there but we are going to be right beside the Marines in the field because that’s what we do.' At that time, Col. Marvel was commander of Marine Aircraft Group 39 (MAG-39) based at Marine Corps Air Station Camp Pendleton in California. He subsequently became the head of the Rapid Capabilities Office and Science and Technology Directorate within the Marine Corps Warfighting Lab (MCWL). 'Coming back to that interoperability, it’s multiple pathways and multiple waveforms. I don’t think we say kill chains anymore, because it’s not a linkage of nodes, It’s a linkage of webs,' Marvel added in his 2023 interview. 'We may very well be an enabler where you’re pushing data through us via voice and or data and we may very well be the end of that kill web or that kill chain enabler as well. We may tell someone where something is so they can go kill it or we maintain custody or someone may tell us where something is so we can go kill it like we have traditionally done. Interoperability is a huge focus for us.' 'We are going to be able to carry a Potpourri of weapons. It would not be unheard of to hang some exquisite fixed-wing fighter weapons on the wing-stub of a cobra and bring that to a fight,' he continued. 'It may be a loitering weapon or maybe an exquisite pod that does only certain things that we’re used to seeing on fixed-wing aircraft and bring that to the fight and put that down at the rotor wing level to enable the battlespace commander and the maneuver element commander to do things that they may or may not have thought they could do before. So that’s kind of where we are with capabilities buildup.' With our first look at an AH-1Z with a new longer-range munition capability now in hand, more details about LRAM/PASM and other work to extend the reach of the Viper may now begin to emerge.

Ukraine Appears To Have Destroyed Its First Russian S-350 Air Def...	Ukraine appears to have destroyed the first example of Russia’s S-350 Vityaz ground-based air defense system since the start of the Kremlin’s full-scale invasion. The S-350 is one of Russia’s most advanced surface-to-air missile systems and has previously only been rarely seen deployed in the conflict. A surveillance drone video released by a Ukrainian Armed Forces artillery reconnaissance brigade, named Chornyi Lis (Black Forest), shows the demise of the S-350 transporter-erector-launcher (TEL) vehicle, purportedly in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine. The video shows a column of Russian vehicles alongside a tree line, before showing the moment of impact on the isolated TEL — the cluster of launch tubes in the upright position, ready to fire means it’s not easily confused with any other Russian system. Meanwhile, the explosion and subsequent shockwave are broadly consistent with that of a M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS, although this is just one possibility. The date of the engagement is not specified, but the presence of plenty of green foliage suggests it could pre-date this winter. Video of an earlier HIMARS strike against a Russian air defense system — this time an S-300/S-400 series system — that emerged last summer: A video appeared online that reportedly shows the result of a HIMARS strike on a S-300/S-400 complex in Belgorod region of Russia.I've added a picture in the end of the video. I think it adds a little something. pic.twitter.com/VrCTITiIAH&mdash; Anton Gerashchenko (@Gerashchenko_en) June 3, 2024 'Thanks to the skilled actions of the reconnaissance troops of the Chornyi Lis artillery reconnaissance brigade, we were able to detect and destroy the latest Russian S-350 Vityaz medium- and short-range surface-to-air missile system,' the unit stated. As we have discussed in the past, the S-350 system — developed by the Almaz-Antey company — is made up of different mobile components, including the 50P6 TELs and the very similar 50P6T launcher/loader vehicle, as well as the 50N6A passively electronically scanned array radar, and the 50K6A command post. 50N6A passively electronically scanned array radar vehicle. Vitaly V. Kuzmin 50K6A command post. Vitaly V. Kuzmin The primary missiles fired by the S-350 are from the 9M96 series which can also be used by the long-range S-400 air defense system. The basic 9M96 has a range of only around 18 miles, while the extended-range 9M96D can reach targets at 75 miles, with unconfirmed reports suggesting it could perhaps have a range as far as 90 miles. Each of the 50P6 series launchers can carry 12 of the 9M96 series missiles. Shorter-range 9M100 missiles are also planned to be integrated, these being intended for point defense out to a range of between around six and nine miles. Expected to be carried in much larger numbers on each launch vehicle, it is unclear if these have actually been fielded yet. The S-350, which reportedly began serial production in 2019, and entered service in early 2020, is designed to tackle aircraft, drones, and cruise missiles, as well as ballistic missile targets in limited situations. Reportedly, the S-350 can detect and track up to 40 targets simultaneously while engaging eight of them with two missiles per target.

Photo by PAVEL GOLOVKIN/POOL/AFP via Getty Images PAVEL GOLOVKIN The S-350 was developed with a view to replacing the Cold War-era S-300P series system, an aging weapon that has been employed by Ukraine and Russia in the current conflict. While sharing a high-mobility wheeled chassis like the S-300, the S-350 is altogether more versatile. With the ability to fire missiles optimized for long/medium-range engagements as well as for point defense — at least in its definitive form — the S-350 can cover the same kind of target sets as the S-300 and the Pantsir short-range air defense system (SHORADS).

Photo by DIMITAR DILKOFF/AFP via Getty Images DIMITAR DILKOFF In a previous interview with TWZ, Dmitry Stefanovich, a Research Fellow at the Center for International Security, IMEMO RAS, provided his assessment of the advantages offered by the S-350: 'Their main asset is the increased number of relatively simpler missiles per launcher, which makes it a good tool against salvo strikes of adversary precision weapons, including cruise missiles, UAVs, and guided MLRS rounds, as well as ballistic missiles,' he explained. 'However, there are too few S-350s available due to their somewhat delayed entry into service. Probably the priorities will be shifted now, but in any case, the S-350 has its role in countering adversary precision weapons under any scenario.' As we reported at the time, the S-350 appears to have made its first appearance in the war in Ukraine when evidence emerged of deployment at an airbase less than 40 miles from the Ukrainian border in August 2022. Elements of an S-350 system were seen in an official Russian Ministry of Defense video depicting operations by Su-25 Frogfoot attack aircraft at Taganrog Air Base, near the port city of the same name in the Rostov region of western Russia.

However, by early 2024, there was evidence that the S-350 was also being used on the battlefield within Ukraine’s borders. In February 2024, a video emerged showing a knocked-out 50P6 TEL, which is said to have accidentally been driven into a Russian minefield. The level of damage meant that its crew abandoned it, in an incident that reportedly occurred in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine. Luhansk Oblast, a Russian 50P6E TEL from an S-350 SAM system accidentally drove into a Russian minefield, hitting a mine. The vehicle was reportedly severely damaged, with Russian recovery crews unable to retrieve it due to the minefield. pic.twitter.com/nLbmQandO2&mdash; OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) February 10, 2024 Employment of the S-350 on or close to the front lines is something that we had predicted when the system first appeared at Taganrog. The appearance of this very modern system reflects the continued challenge posed by Ukrainian drones, missiles and guided bombs — as well as crewed aircraft — over the battlefield, with the Russian Armed Forces still incapable of gaining air superiority nearly three years after the full-scale invasion was launched. Unlike the tracked S-300V and Buk series, for example — the older S-300P doesn’t offer the same level of mobility when operating off-road, especially in the snow and mud of the Ukrainian winter. The S-350 is more mobile and better suited to frontline operations thank its predecessor. At the same time, there have been unverified reports from Ukraine suggesting that the S-350 has been pushed toward the front lines to make up for deficiencies in the Pantsir, which has also suffered notably heavy losses — at least 27 examples have been lost, according to the Oryx open-source tracking group. However, many more have likely been lost because Oryx only tabulates losses for which it has visual confirmation. A destroyed Russian Pantsir-S1 air defense system is displayed in the center of Kyiv. Photo by Aleksandr Gusev/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images SOPA Images With that in mind, anything that can further extend Russian air defense coverage — especially against drone and missile threats — is to be welcomed by the Russian Armed Forces. However, with the slow rate of S-350 production — almost certainly hampered by international sanctions — and the unclear status of the new 9M100 missiles, the impact that the system will have on the battlefield will likely be fairly limited, for now.

Aircraft Carrier USS Harry S. Truman In Greece For Repairs Follow...	The U.S. Navy aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman is now in port in Greece for repairs following the collision with the cargo ship M/V Besiktas-M this past week. The service is continuing to assess the full extent of damage to the flattop, which is in the middle of a deployment that has already included combat operations in and around the Red Sea. The Navy announced yesterday that Truman had arrived at Naval Support Activity (NSA) Souda Bay in Greece for what it has described as an Emergent Repair Availability (ERAV). The carrier had made a port stop in Souda Bay just days before the collision, which occurred on February 12 in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Egypt as it was about to enter the Suez Canal. The incident remains under investigation. The USS Harry S. Truman underway in the Mediterranean Sea on February 15 following the collision with the M/V Besiktas-M. USN Petty Officer 3rd Class Michael Shen 'An assessment team will conduct a full survey of damaged areas and develop a repair plan to be executed immediately following completion of the assessment,' according to an official press release. 'The assessment team includes structural engineers, naval architects, and other personnel from FDRMC [the Forward Deployed Regional Maintenance Center] and Norfolk Naval Shipyard (NNSY). They will be supported by ship’s force personnel and local industry partners for the repair effort.' On Friday, the Navy released a picture showing damage to a sponson on the starboard side of the stern end of the ship's number three aircraft elevator. The service subsequently released additional images, seen at the top of this story and below, showing further damage to the aft end of the starboard side of the hull. The first picture the Navy released showing damage to a sponson next to the number three aircraft elevator. USN A picture showing additional damage to the aft end of the starboard side of Truman's hull. USN MCC Jose Hernandez 'Damage [already] assessed includes the exterior wall of two storage rooms and a maintenance space. External to the ship, damage assessed includes a line handling space, the fantail, and the platform above one of the storage spaces,' according to the new Navy release. 'Aircraft elevator number three sustained no damage and is fully operational. Forward Deployed Regional Maintenance Center (FDRMC) will lead the pier side ERAV, including an assessment and follow-on repairs to damages sustained.' The Navy has previously said Truman did not experience any flooding and that its nuclear reactors were safe and sound as a result of the collision. None of the aircraft onboard were damaged and none of the crew were injured. Details about the full extent of the damage to Besiktas-M remain unclear. There have been no reported injuries among its crew. The Panamanian-flagged cargo ship appears to be continuing on its planned voyage to the port of Constanta in Romania on the Black Sea, according to online ship tracking site Vessel Tracker.

'The United States’ relationships with Allies and partners provides access to ports around the world, granting the U.S. Navy strategic pier availability and resources critical for operational flexibility.' 'While the ship is fully mission capable and the ship conducted flight operations following the collision, pulling into port for emergent repairs will enable the ship to continue deployment as scheduled,' Navy Capt. Dave Snowden, the carrier's commanding officer, also said in a statement. An F/A-18 Super Hornet launches from the USS Harry S. Truman on February 15. USN MC2 Emily Guillory At the same time, it remains to be seen how long Truman might be sidelined following the collision. As noted, the ship is in the middle of a deployment that has already included supporting ongoing operations against Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen and ISIS-affiliated terrorists in Somalia. The are no other U.S. carriers in the region currently and the time Truman spends in port now for repairs could still have significant operational impacts. 'The Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group (HSTCSG) units remain operational across geographic regions in support of their component commanders,' Rear Adm. Sean Bailey, commander of the strike group, said in a separate statement. 'Our mission has not changed and we remain committed to responding to any challenge in this dynamic and global security environment.' In addition, to the Truman and its embarked air wing, the strike group includes the Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Gettysburg and the Arleigh Burke class destroyers USS Stout, USS The Sullivans, and USS Jason Dunham. In December, Gettysburg shot down an F/A-18F Super Hornet fighter assigned to Truman in a separate friendly fire incident that is also still under investigation. Whatever happens, Truman will now be in port in Souda Bay for at least some amount of time as Navy personnel get a full picture of the damage and determine what repairs are necessary to get the flattop back on station.

Bunker Talk: Let’s Talk About All The Things We Did And Didn’t Co...	Welcome to Bunker Talk. This is a weekend open discussion post for the best commenting crew on the net, in which we can chat about all the stuff that went on this week that we didn’t cover. We can also talk about the stuff we did or whatever else grabs your interest. In other words, it’s an off-topic thread. The caption to this week’s top shot reads: NANTWICH, ENGLAND - MAY 24: The British Telecom telephone exchange inside the former RAF Hack Green secret nuclear bunker on May 24, 2023 in Nantwich, England. Hack Green played a central role in the defence of Britain for almost sixty years.

If you want to talk politics, do so respectfully and know that there’s always somebody that isn’t going to agree with you. If you have political differences, hash it out respectfully, stick to the facts, and no childish name-calling or personal attacks of any kind. If you can’t handle yourself in that manner, then please, discuss virtually anything else. No drive-by garbage political memes. No conspiracy theory rants. Links to crackpot sites will be axed, too. Trolling and shitposting will not be tolerated. No obsessive behavior about other users. Just don’t interact with folks you don’t like. Do not be a sucker and feed trolls! That’s as much on you as on them. Use the mute button if you don’t like what you see. So unless you have something of quality to say, know how to treat people with respect, understand that everyone isn’t going to subscribe to your exact same worldview, and have come to terms with the reality that there is no perfect solution when it comes to moderation of a community like this, it’s probably best to just move on. Finally, as always, report offenders, please. This doesn’t mean reporting people who don’t share your political views, but we really need your help in this regard. The Bunker is open!

Hole Blasted By Drone In Chernobyl’s Radiation Shield: What We Kn...	Top Ukrainian nuclear experts tell The War Zone that they are concerned about the future effects of a drone strike on the radiation shield covering the doomed Reactor 4 at the decommissioned Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. While the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said there was no immediate radiation release, the massive, complexly designed New Safe Containment (NSC) structure was compromised and could suffer further damage, the experts told us. In addition, one expert expressed concern that in a worst-case scenario, the ensuing repair work could require the entire containment structure to be rolled back on tracks, exposing the destroyed inner core that the NSC was designed to encapsulate. This infographic shows the location of the drone strike on the New Safety Containment structure at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant. (Photo by Murat Usubali/Anadolu via Getty Images) Anadolu The concerns were raised after a drone struck the NSC overnight, causing a fire and breach of the NSC roof's outer layer, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi stated. While the outer layer sustained damage, investigations are ongoing to determine the status of the inner layer of that roof. Video and images emerging in the aftermath show a fire, as well as remains of the drone that fell into the facility. Emergency personnel on top of the NSC were also seen assessing the damage. Ukraine says this was a deliberate attack while the Russians say they did not strike the facility. Because the structure is so tall, the possibility exists that this could have been accidental.

We must hold Russia accountable, not appease it. pic.twitter.com/QBlSdctK6y&mdash; Maria Avdeeva (@maria_avdv) February 14, 2025 The nearly 2,000-ton NSC is a huge arch structure. Standing 360 feet tall, 213 feet long, and 850 feet wide, it was built to slide over the remains of the reactor that melted down in 1986. In the wake of that disaster, workers built a 21-story tall 'sarcophagus' to cover Reactor 4. However, it left many gaps and was not secured to the underlying structure, which could still collapse. That left the enclosure vulnerable to leaking rainwater, settling, earthquakes, as well as aircraft and projectiles. To mitigate these problems, the NSC was built at the cost of nearly $2 billion and pushed via railroad-like tracks over the sarcophagus in 2016. While designed to withstand an earthquake, tornadoes and even small aircraft strikes, the NSC was not built to protect against an explosive drone, the experts told us.

Another big concern is that explosive shock waves from the strike could have caused damage far beyond the hole it punched in what was a virtually hermetically sealed container, the commander of the radiation surveillance platoon in the Chernobyl Zone during the first months after the 1986 explosion told us. The NSC is a complex, integrated system with many components and the section that was struck is just one part of that, explained Mirnyi, now a research fellow at the National Chernobyl Museum in Kyiv. 'The main problem is not the opening itself, but rather what will happen to the other components and the system as a whole,' Miryni explained. There are two layers to the roof. The drone punched through the first layer and officials are assessing the integrity of the second. However, the strike damaged rails attached to it designed to move cranes that eventually will take apart the remains of Reactor 4, Olena Pareniuk, a senior researcher for Ukraine’s Institute for Safety Problems of Nuclear Power Plants (ISSNP), told us. ISSNP oversees operations at the NSC. The damage will delay testing on the crane system, Pareniuk stated. 'That’s a big deal,' she exclaimed, adding that an assessment is now underway to determine the extent of the damage. Inside the New Safe Confinement Arch, December 2016 (chnpp.gov.ua/) The worst-case scenario is that future repair work will require the NSC to be rolled back on the tracks, exposing the sarcophagus. 'That is an unstable structure,' she said of the sarcophagus. 'Of course, it would be dangerous if we had to do this.' That would risk the release of radioactive material and be 'crazy expensive,' she said. Mirnyi estimated that the repair work could cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Pareniuk stressed that it was very early in the process and much more will come to light in the coming days and weeks. This is the latest in a series of incidents affecting nuclear power plants in the Ukrainian war zone. There were concerns raised when the Russians first occupied Chernobyl in the early days of the war that radioactive dirt could be kicked up by their presence and the facility itself could be struck by a weapon. Just weeks later, combat at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), Europe’s largest, sparked global concerns after a training facility on the site was struck by a projectile. The Russians later occupied ZNPP and built defensive fortifications on it as both sides traded accusations about attacks there.

We will know more about the exact extent of the damage and the cost to repair it in the coming days and weeks.

America’s First Broken Arrow Incident Happened 75 Years Ago	The United States lost its first nuclear weapon exactly 75 years ago when a Convair B-36 Peacemaker jettisoned a single freefall nuclear bomb before crashing in northwestern British Columbia, Canada. This was the first of at least 32 known U.S. nuclear weapon accidents, of the kind known as Broken Arrows, which are defined as the accidental launching, firing, detonating, theft, or loss of a weapon. None of these have occurred since the Cold War, but their legacy remains a stark reminder of the enormously high stakes faced by atomic warfighters in all their forms. Just before midnight on February 13, 1950, a B-36B from Strategic Air Command’s 7th Bombardment Wing-Heavy, opened its bomb bay doors at around 8,000 feet, around 55 miles northwest of Bella Bella, on the north coast of British Columbia. A single Mk 4 nuclear bomb plummeted into the Pacific Ocean; there was a bright flash on impact, followed by a sound and shockwave. B-36s over Illinois on July 4, 1949. The aircraft are very likely B-36Bs from the 7th Bombardment Wing at Carswell Air Force Base. U.S. Air Force The detonation was caused by the bomb’s high-explosive material, with the fissile core having been removed and replaced with a lead practice core of the same weight. Otherwise, with a yield of up to 31 kilotons, it would have had roughly twice the destructive power of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Led by pilot Capt. Harold Barry, the crew of the B-36 took the decision to drop the unarmed bomb after encountering serious mechanical problems in the course of a training mission. This had involved a simulated combat profile flown between Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska and Carswell Air Force Base in Texas (the latter was the home station of the 7th Bombardment Wing, Heavy). The simulated target would have been San Francisco, standing in for a Soviet or Chinese city of comparable size. The aircraft commander of a B-36 of the 11th Bombardment Wing, Heavy, prepares to fly a practice mission from Carswell Air Force Base in Texas. U.S. Air Force At the time, the B-36 was very much the cutting-edge of Strategic Air Command — the first truly intercontinental U.S. bomber, the airframe involved in the incident was also very new, with only 186 hours of flying before its loss. Soon after taking off, the bomber had run into trouble. After entering bad weather, ice began to form on the exterior of the aircraft. In an effort to maintain the required altitude, the crew powered up the engines. Around six hours into the training mission and at an altitude of around 12,000 feet, three of the engines caught fire and had to be shut down. The bomber was now flying on its remaining three Pratt & Whitney Wasp Major radial engines — the B-model was yet to receive the four additional J47 turbojet engines, two each in two underwing pods, which appeared on later Peacemakers and gave a much-needed performance boost. A B-36 on deployment at RAF Lakenheath, England, in January 1951. This example has the underwing pods with additional jet engines. Photo by Mirrorpix via Getty Images Mirrorpix Despite the emergency power settings on the three engines, the aircraft was now losing altitude. When it became apparent that level flight could no longer be maintained, the decision was made to abandon the aircraft. First, and following Air Force protocol of the time, the Mk 4 nuclear bomb had to be jettisoned, its fuze having been set to detonate at around 4,600 feet — once again, there was no nuclear material in the weapon. At this time, U.S. freefall bombs were designed to have their fissile cores inserted during flight, a safeguard that was deemed necessary for these first-generation strategic weapons. Only with a Presidential decision would a bomber take off with the fissile core onboard. A Mk IV nuclear bomb. This was essentially an improved and mass-produced version of the Fat Man weapon that was dropped on Nagasaki. Public Domain Barry later told an Air Force board of inquiry, in a testimony later published by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists: 'We were losing altitude quite rapidly in excess of 500 feet a minute, and I asked the radar operator to give me a heading to take me out over water. We kept our rapid rate of descent, and we got out over the water just about 9,000 feet, and the copilot hit the salvo switch, and at first, nothing happened, so he hit it again and this time it opened. The radar operator gave me a heading to take me back over land, the engineer gave me emergency power to try to hold our altitude. We still descended quite rapidly, and by the time we got over land, we were at 5,000 feet. So, I rang the alarm bell and told them to leave.' Capt. Barry then set the aircraft’s course to fly southwest for an ocean crash. The 17-man crew bailed out over Princess Royal Island. The crew of a Strategic Air Command B-36. In this case, the variant is an RB-36 from the 72nd Strategic Reconnaissance Wing. U.S Air Force There was a huge rescue effort to try and recover the crew and sensitive equipment from the aircraft. In all, more than 40 U.S. and Canadian aircraft were involved. A search southwest of the bailout point found no sign of the bomber, which was, at this point, thought to have come down in the sea. Of the crew, five were never recovered. It’s presumed they came down in the water between Gil and Princess Royal islands. In freezing conditions, and without exposure suits, they wouldn’t have survived long; furthermore, not all the crew had inflatable life jackets. As for the B-36, the wreckage was eventually found in 1953, on the side of Mount Kologet on Vancouver Island, around 220 miles north of where the crew had bailed out. The bomber had been uncovered during a separate Royal Canadian Air Force search for a missing oil prospector. The approximate location of the crash site, and other key locations in the incident, including Eielson Air Force Base, from where the B-36 took off. Google Earth With concerns that sensitive equipment from the bomber might find its way into the Soviets’ hands, the U.S. Air Force sent a recovery team, but they were initially unable to access the mountainous crash site. Two follow-up missions were sent and, finally, in 1954, a small demolition team managed to get to the crash site and secure or destroy classified parts of the bomber. One of the missing crewmembers was the atomic weaponeer, Capt. Theodore Schreier. With no confirmation that he bailed out, this led to some speculation that he may have decided to stay onboard the stricken aircraft. This, in turn, raised questions about whether the bomb had also remained on board, with Schreier attempting to nurse the aircraft back to Alaska. However, all evidence points to the crew having successfully fuzed the bomb to explode, dropping it out of the bomb bay, and watching it detonate above the water. A more recent investigation of the crash site suggests the same, with the bomb shackle showing no evidence that the plane crashed with a weapon onboard. The relatively intact bomb shackle among the wreckage. Diefenbunker: Canada’s Cold War Museum As the site of the first Broken Arrow, the location of the crash has been visited periodically by investigators in the years since the accident. Also, trophy hunters have stripped much of what was left of the bomber for artifacts. Now, with the availability of helicopters, and with less snow on the ground, it has become much easier to reach the crash site. Wreckage from the characteristic B-36 cockpit section. Diefenbunker: Canada’s Cold War Museum During a 2003 visit, an investigation team found the aft crew compartment, the rear bomb bay, and one section of the outer wing, as the only significant intact parts, with the wreckage otherwise mostly consisting of the tiny pieces left after the demolition team did their work. When the B-36 and its nuclear cargo were lost on February 13, 1950, the United States and the Soviet Union were only just embarking on the Cold War and the tense nuclear standoff that would follow for decades beyond. Indeed, at the time of this incident, the United States still enjoyed a huge advantage over its adversary in terms of nuclear capability, with around 235 fully functional atomic bombs, compared to perhaps two in the Soviet Union.

Armstrong Roberts/ClassicStoc As the Soviets matched that gap, and the nuclear stockpiles in East and West continued to grow, the demands of maintaining and operating weapons safely became ever greater. Broken Arrow incidents have led to the confirmed loss of six nuclear weapons that were never recovered, but each incident has also served as a stark learning process, leading to revisions in how U.S. nuclear weapons are stored and operated. In the Canadian context, another Mk 4 nuclear bomb was jettisoned over Quebec later in 1950, after a Strategic Air Command B-50 suffered engine trouble, but subsequently landed safely. In that incident, the high explosive detonated, and around 100 pounds of uranium — used for the bomb’s tamper, the dense metal used to hold the core together, rather than the core itself — were scattered over the nearby area. As for the U.S. Air Force, the service’s nuclear-armed bombers would soon be airborne at all times, in an alert posture known as Operation Chrome Dome, which ran from 1960 to 1968. Several high-profile nuclear accidents, including the accidental release of nuclear weapons on foreign territory, saw Chrome Dome replaced. Crew race to their B-52G at a Strategic Air Command base around 1960. ullstein bild/ullstein bild via Getty Images ullstein bild Dtl. Between 1969 and 1991, the Air Force instead kept B-52 bombers armed with nuclear weapons on alert at all times to try to ensure that they could rapidly get airborne and escape any potential first strike on their operating bases and then be available to retaliate. You can read more about this doctrine in this past War Zone piece. A Broken Arrow event of the kind that happened in February 1950 might seem unthinkable today, but there have been some concerning nuclear incidents, even in more recent years. Notably, in 2007, Air Force personnel mistakenly loaded six AGM-129 Advanced Cruise Missiles, each with a W80-1 variable-yield nuclear warhead, with a maximum yield estimated at 150 kilotons, onto a B-52 at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota. U.S. Air Force personnel load AGM-129s onto a B-52H bomber in 2002. U.S. Air Force The Stratofortress then flew with these weapons on board, unknown to the crew, to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. In the end, the aircraft was armed with live nuclear weapons for a total of 36 hours before personnel uncovered the error and instituted appropriate security and safety precautions at Barksdale. Ultimately, human beings are fallible, as are the systems they have designed to control nuclear weapons. While the Air Force may not have been involved in a Broken Arrow incident since 1980 — and the last one involved an ICBM, rather than a crewed bomber — the potential hazards of the deadly business of nuclear warfighting remain just as relevant today.

Canada Joining Iron Dome Missile Defense Plan Would Be Welcome: N...	U.S. Air Force Gen. Gregory Guillot, the top American military officer overseeing operations in and around North America, has said he would welcome Canadian participation in expanding continental missile defense efforts, including in space. One of President Donald Trump's first official acts of his second term was to order the U.S. military to move forward with plans for a massively enlarged missile defense architecture, dubbed Iron Dome, which notably includes a call for new space-based anti-missile interceptors. Guillot also lauded Canada's efforts to expand its ability to help safeguard North American airspace through new radars and missiles for its existing CF-18 Hornet fighters and planned purchases of stealthy F-35A Joint Strike Fighters. Gen. Guillot, who is head of U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) and the U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), testified on a wide range of issues before the Senate Armed Services Committee yesterday. U.S. Air Force Gen. Gregory Guillot seen an earlier hearing. Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images 'I met recently with the Defense Minister from Canada [Bill Blair]. They are very much interested in participating. They have legal obstacles, but they assume they can jump over them. [They are] very much [interested in] participating in the missile defense system. And their best contribution could come in what way?' Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, asked at one point during the hearing. Canadian Defense Minister Blair publicly said that 'an integrated missile defense system for all of North America is the thing that makes sense to everybody' and expressed interest in partnering in some way on Iron Dome during a call with reporters earlier this month. Canada teaming up with the United States on North American missile defense is something that has also been discussed in the past. Canadian Defense Minister Bill Blair. Thomas Niedermueller/Getty Images Thomas Niedermueller 'I welcome their participation. I think the first [point] would be to buy into our domain awareness expansion, whether ground-based or space-based,' Guillot said in response to Senator Reed's question. 'Then, further down the line, if they get [missile] defeat mechanisms, see how they would mesh with our existing defense mechanisms, defeat mechanisms, in a similar way that we employ fighter aircraft with NORAD. Perhaps we could do the same with missile defeat systems from the ground.' The 'domain awareness expansion' Guillot referred to here are efforts to grow the available sensor architecture, especially in space, to be able to better spot and track incoming threats, as well as provide high-quality targeting data to attempt intercepts. Work to develop and field new space-based sensor systems to tackle advanced hypersonic weapons with very high degrees of maneuverability and that fly along largely flat atmospheric trajectories, which them difficult to track and defend against, has been a particular area of focus for years already. A now-dated infographic that still reflects the U.S. military's current stated plans for a new space-based missile defense-focused sensor architecture, as well as communications networks to support it. DOD At yesterday's hearing, Guillot highlighted existing work on new space-based sensor networks, as well as other efforts to improve 'domain awareness,' as some of the most immediate things that could be leveraged to meet the requirements of the new Iron Dome plan. 'The top priority in that, in our efforts to meet the direction of the [Iron Dome] executive order is first and foremost to establish increased domain awareness. As I mentioned in the opening comments, you can't defeat what you can't see, and the adversaries have an increasing capability of reaching us and threatening us from ranges beyond what some of our current systems can detect and track,' Guillot explained. 'So the first layer of any approach to defending the United States or North America, from the NORAD perspective, would be a sensor layer from seabed to space, systems that can detect threats from a further distance.' 'Those are seabed, ground-based, air-based, such as the E-7 [Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft], and then space-based systems for detecting, tracking, and warning,' he continued. 'Inside of that, I think we build on our existing GBI and NGI capabilities, the Ground-Based Interceptors and Next Generation Interceptors, to defeat intercontinental ballistic missiles.' The U.S. Air Force is in the process of acquiring E-7s to replace its aging E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft. A relatively small number of silo-launched GBIs currently form the core of U.S. military capabilities to actually defeat higher-end ballistic threats, and now increasingly novel hypersonic ones. New NGIs are expected to eventually replace the older GBIs. With the exception of surface-to-air missile systems positioned around Washington, D.C., and the greater National Capital Region (NCR), defense against cruise missiles and other aerial threats falls almost exclusively to fighters. The U.S. Air Force, including the Air National Guard, provides the majority of that capacity for both NORTHCOM and NORAD, something we will come back to later. A graphic offering a very general look at the fields of coverage offered by the current elements of the US military’s missile defense architecture inside the United States and forward-deployed elsewhere around the world. US Army 'Some of those capabilities are right on the edge. Others are probably three to five years out,' the NORTHCOM and NORAD commander added. 'I think within inside of a year, we could have a significant capability that could network those into a single sensing grid.' TWZ has reported extensively on recent U.S. military efforts to develop and field new early warning and intelligence-gathering satellite constellations, in particular. The work looks set to provide American forces with unprecedented persistent surveillance capacity to support strategic missions, such as detecting and tracking incoming threats to the U.S. homeland, as well as more tactical operations. The new constellations will also be distributed in nature with large numbers of smaller satellites, which will help them provide more coverage globally and make them more resistant to enemy attacks. You can read more about these developments in detail here. Beyond satellites, the U.S. military has been working to improve ground-based early warning radar coverage around the U.S. homeland in recent years. The U.S. Navy has also been pursuing new undersea monitoring capabilities with a particular eye toward tracking very quiet and otherwise increasingly more capable Russian and Chinese submarines that present ever-greater threats to the continental United States. Improving the ability of U.S. and Canadian forces to defend the airspace over and around North America more generally has already been a top priority for many years now, as well. The infamous Chinese spy balloon incident in 2023, as well as the downing of three still-unidentified objects in the skies above the United States and Canada that year, put new emphasis on this issue.

Canadian DND via Access to Information Request Via CTV News Drone incursions around U.S. military bases and other critical infrastructure in the United States, as well as facilities that host American forces overseas, including many incidents that TWZ has been the first to report on across years of calling attention to this particular issue, have now become a major factor in these discussions, as well. At the hearing yesterday, Guillot also testified at length about uncrewed aerial threats and efforts to better protect against them, as you can read more about here. As noted earlier, U.S. Air Force fighters currently provide almost all of the more general air defense capacity for North America as a whole. There has been talk about the potential reestablishment of surface-to-air missile sites more broadly within the United States, too. An unclassified map showing NORAD air defense nodes in the contiguous United States circa 2021. Green circles denote bases hosting fighters. DOD The Canadians 'were very collaborative on defining the NORAD requirements and their NORAD modernization is at the very beginning stages. We are seeing improved F-18 radars and missile capabilities already,' Guillot also said in response to a separate question during yesterday's hearing about Canada's commitments to that command. 'The next step we'll see is the arrival of the F-35 in the next two years. So they're well on the track, but we do have some immediate improvements with their F-18s.' Starting in the 2010s, the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) has been upgrading its fleet of aging CF-18A/B+ Hornet fighters. The most notable component of those efforts has been the integration of new AN/APG-79(V)4 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars that greatly improve the ability of those aircraft to spot and track targets, even smaller ones, and do so at extended ranges. The RCAF has also been working to acquire new AIM-120D Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) and AIM-9X Sidewinders to go with those modernized jets. An AMRAAM-armed CF-18. RCAF In 2023, Canadian authorities also finalized plans to buy 88 F-35As, with the first expected to arrive in 2026. The twists and turns that led to that decision were an absolute saga that you can read more about here. Canadian authorities are now in the process of refining requirements for a future national ground-based air defense enterprise, something the country does not currently have, as well. Canadian Defense Minister Blair's comments earlier this month notwithstanding, there is certainly a question about how realistic any major new cooperation with the United States on missile defense matters, or anything else, might be given the current relations between the two countries. Though President Donald Trump's administration paused planned tariffs against Canada, a trade war is still simmering and there are concerns that it could escalate. On top of that, Trump has repeatedly suggested that Canada could be absorbed into the United States, which has drawn serious backlash from the Canadian government, as well as politicians and the general public in that country. TWZ previously explored how this spat might threaten to upend Canada's plans to acquire F-35s. With or without Canadian participation, what parts of the new Iron Dome missile defense plan ultimately come to fruition remain to be seen. The costs alone to develop and field new space-based anti-missile interceptors are expected to be in the tens of billions, if not hundreds of billions of dollars. Canada also has a substantially smaller defense budget currently than the United States, raising additional questions about the degree to which it might be able contribute. Regardless, America's top military officer in charge of operations in and around North America, as well as at least some members of Congress, are clearly in favor of stepping up cooperation with Canada to better protect both countries against incoming ballistic and other missiles.

Trump Offers India Path To F-35	In something of a surprise announcement, President Donald Trump has offered the F-35 stealth fighter to India as he seeks to forge more defense deals and deeper strategic cooperation with New Delhi. The pitch comes at a time when the Indian Air Force is weighing up its options for buying new combat aircraft, with a diverse range of types already under consideration. In the past, the F-35 had widely been seen as a less likely option, based on its sensitive technologies and the fact that India operates significant quantities of advanced Russian defense systems. Trump made the F-35 offer yesterday during the visit of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Washington, DC. It also comes during the Aero India 2025 international airshow, taking place at Air Force Station Yelahanka in Bengaluru, southwestern India, and also featuring the F-35, as you can read about here.

Photo by Indian Press Information Bureau / Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu 'Starting this year, we’ll be increasing military sales to India by many millions of dollars, we’re also paving the way to ultimately provide India with the F-35 stealth fighter,' Trump said. Speaking after Trump at a joint White House news conference, Modi made no mention of the F-35, although a joint media statement referred to a review of U.S. policy on releasing fifth-generation fighters and other high-end systems to India. Even before Trump took office, the United States was increasingly looking to India as a major arms customer. Last year, Indian arms deals worth almost $4 billion were secured by the Biden administration, including 31 MQ-9B Sky Guardian drones, up to 170 AGM-114R Hellfire air-to-ground missiles, and 310 GBU-39B/B Laser Small Diameter Bombs. Separately, India has also agreed to buy six more P-8I Neptune maritime patrol aircraft, as well as Javelin anti-armor missiles and Stryker infantry combat vehicles. India has also struck deals to manufacture the last two items locally. Military personnel inspect a U.S. Air Force F-35A during Aero India 2025, on February 12, 2025. Photo by IDREES MOHAMMED/AFP via Getty Images IDREES MOHAMMED It’s also worth noting that U.S. officials have previously suggested that the F-35 could be offered to India. Most notably, back in 2018, the then-head of U.S. Pacific Command supposedly stated that he supported the sale of the stealth fighter to India. As to how realistic Trump’s F-35 offer is, that remains to be seen, but there’s meanwhile no doubt that India is in the market for new fighters. In a statement provided to TWZ, Lockheed Martin also welcomed the statement: 'We are encouraged by the recent announcement by President Trump to provide the F-35 to India. Lockheed Martin stands ready to support these government-to-government decisions. We look forward to working closely with both governments on upcoming strategic procurements including the fighters, Javelin, and helicopters that will further empower the Indian Armed Forces with 21st-century security solutions and deterrence capabilities to address their pressing needs. This will be a huge step forward in the growing U.S.-India comprehensive strategic partnership.' A U.S. Air Force F-35A performs during Aero India 2025 in Bengaluru on February 12, 2025. Photo by Idrees MOHAMMED / AFP IDREES MOHAMMED Lockheed Martin says it has been 'a trusted and strategic partner to India for over three decades and has been instrumental in establishing the foundation of the aerospace and defense ecosystem. We’ve proven our commitment through various production programs like the C-130J, S-92 cabin, and the fighter wings feeding into the global supply chain.' Most prominent among the Indian Air Force’s fighter requirements is the Multirole Fighter Aircraft (MRFA) competition, seeking 114 new foreign-made jets. So far, candidates for the MRFA competition include the Dassault Rafale, 36 examples of which India previously acquired, under a separate program. When the 114-aircraft requirement was launched it was billed as being specifically for single-engine types, ruling out the French product. Since then, however, the competition appears to be wide open, with the F-15EX, for example, now also being offered, and the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet also in the running. Other European options comprise the Eurofighter Typhoon and the Saab Gripen E/F, while Russia is pitching its Su-57 Felon, which is also appearing at Aero India this week, and which appears to have finally won its first export order. If India decides to procure another single-engine fighter, after all, the Indian-specific F-21 configuration of the F-16 is also a viable candidate. An artist’s impression of the F-21 as offered to India. Lockheed Martin Of course, the F-35 is also a single-engine fighter, but offers an altogether different level of capabilities and high-end technologies than the other options. Reports in the Indian media suggest that a request for proposals for the MRFA competition will be issued this year. As part of Modi’s ‘Make in India’ initiative, the manufacturers vying for MRFA will need to offer local production and technology transfer. In the past, there was a plan to buy a portion of the new fighters off-the-shelf purchases and build the others under license in India — this is something that Russia has offered specifically as part of its Su-57 bid.

Photo by Idrees MOHAMMED / AFP IDREES MOHAMMED Local manufacture of the F-35 might not be an option for India, especially in the near term and it’s by no means clear if New Delhi would drop this requirement. However, the stealth fighter could potentially be offered with other offsets, including component production and the transfer of certain technologies. This could be particularly interesting for India as it embarks on its own next-generation fighter program, the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA), but it would likely still be limited to a significant degree based on India’s close military ties with Russia. Ultimately, the MRFA program seeks to field interim equipment to help address a contracting Indian Air Force combat fleet and to fill the gap before the planned arrival of the AMCA, India’s homegrown fifth-generation fighter. Like other warplanes in this category, the AMCA will feature a low-observable design, including internal weapons bays, new-generation active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, and advanced avionics, and will be intended, from the outset, to operate alongside drones as part of ‘manned-unmanned’ teaming concept.

(Photo by Idrees MOHAMMED / AFP) IDREES MOHAMMED The latest reports indicate that the AMCA is not expected to enter service until 2036, although there remains a question as to whether a potential F-35 deal could come to fruition within this timeframe. Were it to be made possible, the F-35 would offer an off-the-shelf means of drastically enhancing Indian Air Force capabilities at a time when the service is being rapidly outpaced by developments in China. It could even have the potential to completely transform the Indian Air Force and its future fighter procurement plans. On the Indian side, the government would still have to approve funds for what would be a hugely costly investment. 'There is a process by which platforms are acquired,' Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri told reporters in Washington, sounding a word of caution about a potential F-35 deal. Intergovernmental negotiations have not started and the U.S. Congress would also still need to approve any potential sale. Bearing in mind the sensitive military technologies involved, this could be far from straightforward. In particular, India is an enthusiastic customer of Russian defense products, including air defense systems. India operates the S-400 long-range surface-to-air missile system; the very same equipment that led to Turkey being ejected from the F-35 program in the past. More recently, the U.S. stance on transferring the F-35 to Turkey appears to have softened, but any such deal would still require Turkey to give up its S-400s. The final parts of the second Russian-made S-400 air defense system battery arrive at Murted Airbase in Ankara, Turkey, on September 15, 2019. Photo by TURKISH NATIONAL DEFENSE MINISTRY / HANDOUT/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images Anadolu Turkey had refused to give up its S-400 systems and had to sacrifice its F-35s (and an industrial stake in the program) as a result. Were India to be offered the same choice, it’s entirely unclear if it would agree. At the same time, while Turkey has acquired only a small number of different Russian-made weapons, India has long been one of Moscow’s biggest arms importers, resulting in a close military relationship and a significant ‘Russian lobby’ in Indian defense circles. Ahead of Trump’s announcement, Angad Singh, an Indian defense journalist and contributor to this website, also highlighted the S-400 as a major sticking point for any potential F-35 deal: 'Regardless of political winds in the United States, our case for the F-35 is complicated by the S-400 and the hordes of other Soviet/Russian equipment we operate.' An Indian Army T-90 tank, supplied by Russia, during a firepower demonstration at the Mahajan Firing Range, Rajasthan, in March 2004. RAVEENDRAN/AFP via Getty Images RAVEENDRAN In addition to traditional resistance to selling the highest-end U.S. defense technologies to countries operating particular Russian weapons systems, there is also the very real worry that these technologies could find their way into adversaries’ hands by other means. Concerns of this kind have derailed similar potential deals in the past. The United States has safeguards in place to keep sensitive military technology and capabilities from falling into Russian or Chinese hands, and India’s close ties with Moscow are likely to be a key factor in the approval of any F-35 deal. On the other hand, we are very much entering a new era in U.S. politics and foreign policy and it might well be the case that India’s relationship with Russia, and its Russian-made defense systems, are no longer seen as such a barrier to F-35 sales. Perhaps a deal could also be cut, in which India receives equivalent U.S. air defense systems to replace the S-400. While it’s highly significant that Trump would pitch the F-35 to India in this way, there are many more hurdles to negotiate before we even get to a point where a formal offer can be made. Essentially, what we are seeing now is a review of U.S. fifth-generation fighter policy for India. What happens next is very much unclear, with Indian fighter procurements already well known for their unpredictability.

Photo by MANJUNATH KIRAN/AFP via Getty Images MANJUNATH KIRAN Putting aside the F-35 for a moment, it’s also noteworthy that the U.S. government is increasing its efforts to establish defense ties with India. As well as the potential for more military sales, and not just of fighters, Washington may well be looking to take advantage of Russia’s weakened position on the international stage and take its place by forging a strong defense relationship with India. This would be especially important in terms of the broader geopolitical situation in the Indo-Pacific region, where both the United States and India view China as their main long-term security threat and strategic rival. 'In our meeting today, the prime minister and I reaffirmed that strong cooperation among the United States, India, Australia, and Japan, and it’s crucial really, to maintaining peace and prosperity tranquility, even, in the Indo-Pacific,' Trump said after his meeting with Modri. Ultimately, while the F-35 offer is about what could be a highly lucrative new fighter export deal for the U.S., it is just as much about driving a wedge between Moscow and New Delhi and helping build up the Indian military as a valuable counterbalance to China in the Indo-Pacific region.

Aircraft Carrier USS Harry S. Truman’s Collision Damage Seen In P...	The U.S. Navy has released an image showing damage to the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman following the collision with the cargo ship M/V Besiktas-M off the coast of Egypt in the Mediterranean Sea on Tuesday. Readers can first get up to speed on what had previously been known about the incident in our initial report here. The official caption for the picture is as follows: 'Exterior damage of USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75) viewed from a ship’s rigid-hull inflatable boat following a collision with merchant vessel Besiktas-M, Feb. 12, while operating in the vicinity of Port Said, Egypt. USS Harry S. Truman, the flagship of the Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group (HSTCSG), is on a scheduled deployment in the U.S. 6th Fleet area of operations supporting U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa to defend U.S., Allied and partner interests.' The picture, a full uncropped version of which is seen below, shows multiple large tears through a sponson on the starboard side of the stern end of the ship near one of the aircraft elevators. Whether there is damage elsewhere on the ship is unknown. USN A stock picture of the USS Harry S. Truman. The area that was damaged is right to the left of the aircraft elevator behind the island. USN A close look at the area that was damaged in the collision. USN The Navy has not released details about the estimated cost of or timeline for repairs, or about whether the damage in any way impedes the ship's ability to operate. Warships, especially supercarriers, are designed to withstand combat damage, but it is unclear whether Truman will head to port for repairs or continue on as planned. The carrier and its strike group have supported ongoing operations against Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen and ISIS-affiliated terrorists in Somalia in the past few months. Any substantial time in port for repairs now would have a major operational impact. The Navy did say previously that the collision had caused unspecified damage above the waterline, but had not caused any flooding, damage to aircraft on the deck, or injuries to members of the crew. The service also stressed that the ship's nuclear reactors were safe following the incident. A picture had already emerged yesterday appearing to show damage on the bow end of the starboard side of the Besiktas-M. Further details about the condition of the Panamanian-flagged cargo ship and its crew remain limited. A photo released from one of the crew of #BesiktasM after the collision with #Truman.

Drones Over U.S. Bases May Be Threatening Spy Flights: NORTHCOM C...	Some of the hundreds of drones flying over U.S. military bases and other sensitive areas last year were likely operated with nefarious intentions, the general coordinating the response to domestic incursions told a Senate hearing today. As a result, U.S. Air Force Gen. Gregory M. Guillot, commander of U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) and North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), testified that he needs increased authority to better protect these installations. 'The primary threat I see for them in the way they've been operating is detection and perhaps surveillance of sensitive capabilities on our installations,' Guillot explained to a Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) budget request hearing. He was responding to a question about the numerous drone incursions over U.S. military facilities, like the ones over Langley Air Force Base in 2023 that we were the first to cover. Guillot was not asked, nor did he volunteer information about who was operating these drones. A NORTHCOM spokesperson later declined to elaborate. Defense Officials Testify on 2026 Defense Budget Request @SASCGOP @SASCDems – LIVE online here: #SASC&mdash; CSPAN (@cspan) February 13, 2025 The limits on defending against drones are, at best, relegated to electronic warfare countermeasures, with simply providing awareness largely being the extent of the counter-drone systems deployed at installations in the United States. At this time, directed energy weapons, like lasers and high-power microwave systems, let alone kinetic capabilities, remain off-limits. This is a glaring issue we raised after our trip to see Guillot at his headquarters in Colorado Springs last year. The threat, Guillot told the committee, is widespread. 'There were 350 detections reported last year on military installations, and that was 350 over a total of 100 different installations of all types and levels of security,' Guillot pointed out. Last month, U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) told reporters that 'an aspect of this is our adversaries, it just makes sense that they would do this.' 'When I was stationed down at the Pax River Test Center, we used to have North Koreans on the fence,' Kelly explained. 'So how do you get better video of something? You get better video from a drone over the field than you can by standing at the fence of a military base.' NEW EXCLUSIVE: What UAPs? 'It's our adversaries,' Sen. Mark Kelly says foes regularly invade US airspace (unpaywalled) @AskaPol_uaps (@AskaPol_UAPs) February 8, 2025 As we previously reported, in the wake of drone incursions like those over Langley, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Picatinny Arsenal, and others, NORTHCOM was given the role of synchronizing the U.S. military response. U.S. INDOPACOM was given a similar role for the Pacific. This new role ensures 'standardized training, response, tactical techniques and procedures,' stated Guillot. 'And if the base and the service aren't able to handle the incursion, we can bring in help from across the interagency and DOD to support and, perhaps most critically, is we can work closely with the interagency to give them the authority to operate the systems once they arrive, due to our close relationship with the FAA.' In addition, 'in the near future, I think we will have our own capabilities to bring in from NORTHCOM once we procure them to assist if the service and the installation cannot handle the incursion.' However, the responsibility for defending these installations still rests with the local commanders. Often confusing legal and regulatory hurdles limit how and when many counter-drone systems can be employed within the homeland. Concerns about risks of collateral damage resulting from the use of active anti-drone capabilities factor very heavily, too into this equation. Guillot told the Senators that only about half of the 360 bases in the U.S. - considered 'covered installations - even have permission to defend against drones. This counter-drone system from Leidos demonstrated at Falcon Peak 2025 includes a drone that fires stringy streamers at other uncrewed aerial systems. (Howard Altman) There are nine criteria allowing bases to be covered, Guillot explained. 'It ranges from nuclear deterrence, missile defense all the way down to if it's a test facility,' he said. Given all these issues, Guillot said he wants to see an expansion of anti-drone authorities under U.S. law known as '130(i).' That’s a reference to subsection of Title 10 of the U.S. Code (10 USC 130i), covering current authorities for the 'protection of certain facilities and assets from unmanned aircraft.' Airmen train on how to spot suspicious aircraft and to use the Dronebuster to block radio signals, to potentially ground these aircraft. (U.S. Air Force photo by Tech. Sgt. Jeffery Foster) Tech. Sgt. Jeffery Foster Under 130i, the U.S. military has the authority to take 'action' to defend against drones including with measures to 'disrupt control of the unmanned aircraft system or unmanned aircraft, without prior consent, including by disabling the unmanned aircraft system or unmanned aircraft by intercepting, interfering, or causing interference with wire, oral, electronic, or radio communications used to control the unmanned aircraft system or unmanned aircraft' and the 'use reasonable force to disable, damage, or destroy the unmanned aircraft system or unmanned aircraft.' The law, however, does not go far enough, Guillot posited, saying it should be expanded to pertain to 'all military installations and not just those that are covered,' he urged. Guillot also asked Senators to expand the distance from a base that countermeasures can be employed. 'I'd also like to see the range expanded to slightly beyond the installation, so they don't have to wait for the threat to get over the installation before they can address it,' he proposed. That’s because 'many of these systems can use side-looking or slant range [sensors]. And so they could surveil the base from outside the perimeter, and under the current authorities, we can't address that.' Gen. Gregory Guillot, Commander, North American Aerospace Defense Command and U.S. Northern Command hosted distinguished visitors at Falcon Peak on Fort Carson, Colorado, Oct. 30, 2024. Falcon Peak is a USNORTHCOM led counter-small unmanned aircraft system experiment and the first Department of Defense C-sUAS initiative focused on detecting, tracking, and mitigating sUAS incursions at DoD installations in the United States. Falcon Peak occurred between Oct. 19-30, 2024. (U.S. Department of Defense photos by Josh Armstrong) An expansion of authority under 130 (i) is being considered. Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) explained that he and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) introduced legislation that would 'give these commanders the legal authority they need, plus the capability required to protect their bases from these kinds of incursions and then hold them accountable for doing so.' Any change in 130 (i) authorities would be on top of the Pentagon’s new counter-drone strategy it released in December, which you can read more about here. Among other things, it builds upon a number of existing efforts, including the establishment of the Joint Counter-small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Office (JCO) in 2020. It is also set to tie into a new Pentagon initiative to help speed up the acquisition and fielding of new counter-drone capabilities dubbed Replicator 2. The first Replicator effort has been focused on getting more uncrewed systems into the hands of U.S. warfighters. Because they took place outside the continental United States, the incursions last November over four U.S. Air Force bases in England, which we were also the first to write about, were not addressed by Guillot. Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD) Pacific Target Marine Operations (PTMO) and Threat/Target Systems Department (TTSD) recently deployed small-drones over Naval Base Ventura County (NBVC), Point Mugu to provide cost-effective unmanned aerial system (UAS) familiarization and threat training. NBVC is comprised of three distinct operational facilities: Point Mugu, Port Hueneme and San Nicolas Island. (U.S. Navy photo by Ensign Drew Verbis/Released) Ensign Drew Verbis The general also did not bring up the thousands of drone sightings that took place at the end of last year that were not over U.S. military installations or sensitive facilities. Biden administration officials downplayed that, saying those drones posed no threat nor had any foreign nexus. In addition, most of the sightings were likely not even drones. However, the incidents sparked an FBI investigation and spurred the FAA to issue scores of Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs), mostly over power facilities. We reached out to the FBI today to find out the status of that investigation. Last month, the FBI told us that they had no suspects and recovered no drones. U.S. President Donald Trump has taken a strong interest in drone incursions and declared he would tell the public what was actually happening in the first days of his administration. However, his press office later claimed that the so-called New Jersey Drones were largely FAA authorized or research-related. TWZ saw no evidence of large scale drone incursions over New Jersey, with a chronic issue of people reporting normal aircraft as mysterious drones being glaringly apparent. .@PressSec Karoline Leavitt reads statement from President Trump: 'The drones that were flying over New Jersey in large numbers were authorized to be flown by FAA for research and various other reasons&#8230;this was not the enemy.' pic.twitter.com/M5Qk5exLPn&mdash; CSPAN (@cspan) January 28, 2025 For years, The War Zone has raised concerns about dangers posed by drones, and had laid out a detailed case through dozens of reports that adversaries were taking advantage of the lack of aerial domain awareness over and above the homeland. The issue unidentified aerial phenomena, or UAP, is also tied up in this deeply, which is problematic in its own right. You can read all about this here. Guillot’s testimony is a clear acknowledgment of this reality and the challenges of defending against it. Whether it spurs Congress to give him greater authority to deal with the problem is something that we will know more about in the coming months.

Mystery Tiltrotor Aircraft Spotted At Mojave Air And Space Port I...	A vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft design that recently emerged at the Mojave Air & Space Port in California, which TWZ was first to report on, has been identified. It is a full-scale technology demonstrator (FSTD) belonging to Hyundai Motor Group subsidiary Supernal. Work on the FSTD, which was expected to fly for the first time last year, is feeding into the development of Supernal's S-A2 electrically-powered VTOL, or eVTOL, design. The Air Current was the first to report on Supernal's connection to the previously unseen aircraft at Mojave. Photographer Matt Hartman had previously taken pictures of the aircraft and posted them on social media. Supernal has been working with other firms to craft the FSTD, including U.K.-based GKN Aerospace. TWZ has reached out to both companies for more details about the demonstrator. A closer look at what has now been identified as a full-scale technology demonstrator (FSTD) belonging to Hyundai subsidiary Supernal. Matt Hartman Supernal did announce last July that GKN had delivered the complete composite wing assembly for the FSTD and that the aircraft's tail booms were expected to arrive by the end of that month. A previously released picture of the wing structure, seen below, and the mention of booms align fully with the aircraft that has now emerged at Mojave. Supernal/GKN Aerospace The picture of the wing assembly does raise new questions about whether the four wing-mounted rotors on the FSTD are indeed fixed, as had appeared to be the case from what was visible in Hartman's pictures, or can articulate between vertical and horizontal facing modes. The aircraft does have two larger additional rotors in clearly tilting wing-tip nacelle pods. Otherwise, details about the FSTD remain limited, but readers can find TWZ's full initial analysis of the design here. The FSTD does differ substantially from the S-A2 concept that Supernal officially unveiled at the 2024 Farnborough Airshow in the United Kingdom. That design has four pairs of tilting rotor assemblies, two on each wing, as well as a v-tail rather than a twin-boom type. The center fuselage also has a more streamlined look with a single-piece main windscreen. The internal configuration that has been shown so far consists of a single pilot seated in front and space for four passengers in the cabin behind. 'S-A2 will cruise at 120 mph and have an initial range of 60 miles to meet typical city operation needs. The aircraft utilizes a distributed electric propulsion architecture and will operate quietly to meet community noise standards,' according to a previous Supernal press release. 'Most importantly, S-A2 is engineered to achieve global commercial aviation safety standards with a robust airframe structure that includes redundant components in critical systems such as powertrain, flight controls, and avionics.' Supernal has been targeting a first flight for the S-A2, which it also says will have a total payload capacity of 1,000 pounds, in 2026 and hopes to see the aircraft enter commercial service in 2028. The FSTD, which as noted was expected to fly for the first time last year, has been presented as an important risk-reduction asset in support of the S-A2 development plan. '2024 is a pivotal year for Supernal’s eVTOL development, marking the transition from engineering design to the build and execution phases,' David McBride, the company's Chief Technology officer, said in a statement around the unveiling at Farnborough last year. 'In addition to gaining instrumental learnings from our full-scale technology demonstrator, we will also begin prototype development and continue refining our production vehicle for scaled manufacturing in the coming months.' A rendering of the S-A2 design showing its tilting rotor assemblies in their vertical takeoff and landing mode. Supernal As TWZ highlighted in our initial report on this aircraft, the market space for crewed and uncrewed eVTOLs, as well as hybrid-electric designs that use turbines to produce electricity to drive the rotors, has dramatically expanded in recent years. The commercial aviation sector has been a key focus of these development efforts, including Supernal's S-A2. Armed forces, including the U.S. military, are also working to field or at least evaluate new VTOL designs, including eVTOL types, to perform a variety of missions. As we wrote previously: 'For the U.S. military, interest in new VTOL aircraft designs, including the active development of types with more traditional propulsion arrangements, is being driven in part by a desire for greater runway independence amid concerns about the growing vulnerability of air bases, as well as other established facilities, during a future high-end conflict. This, in turn, has led to the development of new concepts of operations focused heavily on expeditionary and distributed operations, including in remote and austere sites with limited existing infrastructure. New VTOL designs, especially uncrewed ones, are also increasingly viewed as important components of future supply chains for forces in forward areas, including right on the front lines. Casualty evacuation and the extraction of downed pilots, including from behind enemy lines, have also been presented as potential roles for such aircraft.' When it comes to work on Supernal's S-A2, specifically, the company's FSTD is now undergoing at least some degree of testing at Mojave.

Structure At Chinese Shipyard May Point To China’s Next Aircraft ...	We may have just gotten our first sight of China’s next-generation aircraft carrier, generally referred to as the Type 004 — or at least a portion of it. Construction work at a shipyard in Dalian, in China’s Liaoning province, reveals a module that is consistent with an aircraft carrier — which would be China’s fourth, once it enters service — although there remain questions about the precise nature of the object, which may be intended for testing, rather than as part of the finished warship. The module in question, apparently a section of the flight deck, is seen in satellite imagery provided by Google Earth and which first began to circulate on Chinese defense forums. The imagery dates back to May 2024 but was only recently published. Close to the module are mockups of a J-15 Flanker series carrier-based fighter and a Z-8 series naval helicopter. Mockups of this kind are frequently used in carrier development work in China, both on land and at sea. A wider view of the module at Dalian, in a satellite image dated May 17, 2024. Google Earth Well, you all know how sceptical I am usually, but this could actually be proof for the first time that 004 is under construction! @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) February 13, 2025 Provided that what appear as lines running along the module are trenches for catapult tracks, which seems the most likely explanation, this would suggest that the Type 004 will have two waist catapults, in addition to the two bow catapults. This would match the arrangement of the U.S. Navy’s Ford class and would add an extra catapult compared with China’s third carrier, the Type 003 Fujian, which has a single catapult in the waist position.

Ford showing the four catapults found on U.S. Navy supercarriers. U.S. Navy The module is located within the sprawling Dalian complex, the specific location being Xianglujiao, which is where the drydock for China’s earlier Type 001 Liaoning and Type 002 Shandong aircraft carriers is also located. A satellite image dated January 2024 shows that work on the module had begun by this point. Google Earth Three J-15s (or J-15 mockups) seen in a satellite image of the same location dated April 2022. Google Earth TWZ spoke to Alex Luck, a journalist who closely follows the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), for his assessment of the module. Noting that it’s probably too early to make any concrete assessment about the role of this particular module, Luck says that the Dalian location makes sense for a new carrier, with the adjacent dock already used for carrier construction and maintenance. On the other hand, as Luck points out, the first modules spotted for the Fujian, back in 2018, were lower hull segments, rather than a flight deck module, which seems to be what we are looking at here. China’s third aircraft carrier, the Fujian, shortly before it went to sea for the first time in April 2024. via X via X Since lower hull segments make more sense in terms of procedural assembly, it could be the case that this is not a production module but instead a test or demonstrator segment for the future flattop. There is a precedent for this, with a demonstrator module for the future Fujian noted at Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai, back in 2013. With that in mind, a similar approach for the Type 004, involving test portions of the new carrier, to iron out any early problems with the design, wouldn’t be entirely surprising. A demonstrator module for the future Fujian at Jiangnan Shipyard in 2013. via Chinese Internet As for the presence of the aircraft mockups next to the new module, Luck observes that these are likely not necessarily directly related to the new carrier, with the same ones probably having been used for the Liaoning and the Shandong beforehand. Previous rumors had suggested that the Type 004 might be built at a different location, namely Dalian Dagushan, located across the bay from Xianglujiao, so that too raises some questions about the purpose of the module. Dalian Dagushan is where the most recent Type 055 ‘super-destroyers’ and Type 052DL destroyers are being built but, again, we don’t know for sure that the Type 004 will also be built here. The respective locations of Xianglujiao (where the Type 004 module was seen) and Dalian Dagushan. Google Earth Previously, there had also been speculation that the Type 004 might be constructed at Jiangnan, which produced the Fujian, and this shipyard also offered some concept art depicting a new aircraft carrier design. The carrier shown in that artwork had some broad external similarities to the U.S. Navy’s Ford class and France’s future New Generation Aircraft Carrier, although, at this stage, we really can’t say what the Type 004 will look like. An artist’s concept of a future Chinese aircraft carrier. Chinese internet via @HenriKenhmann Whatever the role of the new module, there’s certainly a strong possibility that it’s related to China’s next carrier, with previous suggestions that the Type 004 could enter service sometime in the late 2020s. When it does finally appear, the Type 004 is expected to be a notably more advanced design than Liaoning and Shandong, which are by now well established with the PLAN fleet, as well as the Fujian, the country’s first domestically produced carrier, which is still preparing for operational service. Launched in 2022, the Fujian began sea trials in mid-2024 and is expected to enter operational service in 2025, according to the U.S. Department of Defense. Like Fujian — and in contrast to the two previous carriers — the Type 004 will be equipped to launch aircraft via catapults. The PLAN’s two in-service carriers, the Shandong and the Lioaning, are both short takeoff but arrested recovery, or STOBAR, types with prominent ‘ski jump’ takeoff ramps. Catapults offer manifold advantages, especially when it comes to launching aircraft at higher gross weights, which translates to larger fuel and ordnance loads. They can also generally accommodate a wider array of aircraft types, too. This includes larger and slower designs, like the still-in-development KJ-600 carrier-based airborne early warning and control aircraft, as well as smaller ones, such as drones. A satellite view of a prototype KJ-600. via Chinese Internet Another satellite image shows a KJ-600 prototype in the green primer paint now frequently seen on Chinese naval aircraft. via Chinese internet Presumably, the Type 004 will have an advanced electromagnetic aircraft launch system (EMALS), provided it proves to be successful on the Fujian. Otherwise, this type of equipment is currently only in use with the U.S. Navy. Aside from the KJ-600, the air wing for the new carrier will likely include the J-35 stealth fighter, supported by advanced versions of the J-15 multirole fighter. The carrier is also likely to host various drones, such as navalized versions of the GJ-11 Sharp Sword uncrewed combat aerial vehicle (UCAV), plus helicopters. One of the first prototypes of the carrier-based J-35 stealth fighter. via Chinese internet There have long been reports that the Type 004 will be a nuclear-powered vessel, which would give it effectively unlimited range and help meet the power-generation demands of ever-improving sensors, other mission systems, and possibly directed-energy weapons. At this stage, that remains unconfirmed but would certainly be in line with the PLAN’s expanding carrier ambitions. As well as its aircraft carriers, China is meanwhile also working to introduce a number of very large big-deck amphibious assault ships, referred to as the Type 076. Each will feature at least one electromagnetic catapult that is expected to be primarily used to launch drones, as you can read more about here. In its latest assessment of Chinese military power, the Pentagon doesn’t explicitly mention the Type 004, but does state that the PLAN is 'in the beginning stages of operating its multi-carrier force.' It also notes that the Fujian is just the first warship within a 'nextgeneration of carriers' that will be characterized by 'greater endurance and an electromagnetic catapult launch system, making them capable of launching various types of specialized fixed-wing aircraft for missions, such as airborne early warning and electronic warfare. This will increase the striking power of a potential PLAN carrier battle group when deployed to areas beyond the PRC’s immediate periphery.' While the PLAN’s carrier force is still clearly outmatched by the U.S. Navy’s fleet of 11 active nuclear-powered supercarriers, China is already benefiting from having multiple carriers to draw on, and this advantage is set to become more pronounced in the years to come. As the Chinese military buildup continues, the Type 004 future aircraft carrier is clearly a program to watch.

Trump Admin Makes Major Moves For Negotiated End Of Ukraine War	U.S. President Donald Trump made major moves to end the war in Ukraine on Wednesday, saying that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to peace talks that would begin 'immediately.' The actions came after U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said America was no longer 'primarily focused on the security of Europe,' and that the idea that Ukraine would not have to cede territory to Russia in order to end the conflict is not realistic. In 'a lengthy and highly productive phone call' with Putin, the two 'agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately,' Trump said in a social media post, adding that the process began by informing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky of the conversation. He also suggested that he and Putin agreed to visit 'each other’s nations.' Trump said he instructed Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of the CIA John Ratcliffe, National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, and Ambassador and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, 'to lead the negotiations which, I feel strongly, will be successful.'

'It would certainly seem unlikely,' Trump said, adding that Russia 'took a lot of land' and 'lost a lot of soldiers&#8230;I'm not making an opinion on it but I read a lot on it and a lot of people think that's unlikely.'

'We want, like you, a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine, but we must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective,' said Hegseth ahead of his first meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group. 'Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering. A durable peace for Ukraine must include robust security guarantees to ensure that the war will not begin again.' Ukraine’s joining NATO is also unrealistic, Hegseth declared, adding that any future security arrangement will not involve U.S. troops on the ground. Meanwhile, Hegseth suggested that the U.S. will now focus far more heavily on its needs over Europe’s. The U.S., he avowed, 'faces consequential threats to our homeland. We are focusing on the security of our own borders. We also face a peer competitor in the Communist Chinese with the capability and intent to threaten our homeland and core national interests in the Indo-Pacific. The U.S. is prioritizing deterring war with China in the Pacific, recognizing the reality of scarcity, and making the resourcing trade-offs to ensure deterrence does not fail. Deterrence cannot fail for all of our states as the United States prioritizes its attention to these threats. European allies must lead from the front.' Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth (@SecDef) February 12, 2025 Trump’s major official push into the Russia-Ukraine diplomatic process comes as European leaders are discussing the future of this conflict and ways to support Ukraine goring forward.

The Kyiv Independent (@KyivIndependent) February 10, 2025 Despite U.S. pressure, Zelensky has refused to draft those under 25 years of age. However, Ukraine is trying a new approach to meet its desperate need for additional troops. 'Starting Tuesday, Kyiv is now enticing young people to join the army with lucrative military contracts, offering a million hryvnias (about €23,000), social benefits and elite training for volunteers who sign up before they turn 25,' Politico reported on Wednesday. 'But this decision has angered some Ukrainian soldiers who voluntarily joined the army and are still serving despite no prospect of demobilization in sight — while not getting the same benefits as those offered to the youngsters.' Ukraine 'devalues ​​all those who voluntarily joined the army at the beginning of a full-scale war,' Masi Nayyem, a Ukrainian serviceman and prominent lawyer, said in a Facebook post. Kyiv rejects lowering the draft age from 25 to 18 despite US pressure. Instead, it’s launching a new approach: Starting today, Ukraine offers young volunteers €23K, social benefits & elite training if they enlist before 25.

'In general, we can say that the 'Soloist is a one-time adjustable infantry munition with first-person control and the possibility of attacking targets (primarily armored vehicles) from above,' IZ reported. 'Moreover, the operator can work from the shelter, being quite far from the target. And the range of 10 km exceeds the existing anti-tank missile systems and approaches the 120-mm mortars.' In addition, 'as a combat load, the Soloist can use regular ammunition from RPG-7 and LNG-9 grenade launchers - the most common in the Russian army, and possibly in the world.' IZ noted. The weapons can use high-explosive, shrapnel or thermobaric warheads. 'It is important to note that the 'Soloist' is still not a UAV, namely, an adjustable munition,' IZ explained.

Containerized SAM System That Fires Soviet Air-To-Air Missiles Fo...	We now have our first look at the containerized Gravehawk surface-to-air missile system, which uses repurposed Soviet-era heat-seeking R-73 air-to-air missiles as interceptors, that the United Kingdom and Denmark have developed for Ukraine. Gravehawk is the latest in a series of what have become commonly referred to as 'FrankenSAMs' that leverage existing capabilities within the Ukrainian armed forces' arsenal to help rapidly provide badly needed additional air defenses. Forces News in the United Kingdom was first to publish the pictures and video of Gravehawk, and to report on additional details about the system and its development. British authorities first disclosed the existence of the Gravehawk project in January, but provided only limited information and no visuals at that time. The slightly mad scientists at the UK MOD have revealed the Gravehawk surface-to-air missile system for Ukrainian service. The entire SAM system fits in a standard shipping container, carries a pair of converted R-73 AAMs, and can be quickly deployed off the back of a flatbed. pic.twitter.com/BTF0b7LjCg&mdash; OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) February 12, 2025 It took a U.K. Ministry of Defense element called Taskforce Kindred and an unspecified group of private contractors approximately 18 months and six million pounds (almost $7.5 million based on the rate of conversion at the time of writing) to develop Gravehawk, according to Forces News. The unit cost is around one million pounds ($1.24 million). The entire system fits inside a modified ISO shipping container with a retractable roof. Two Gravehawks have been delivered to Ukraine to date and have already been used in combat, and the country is set to eventually get 15 more of them. Forces News' report indicates that Gravehawk is intended to be emplaced on the ground before use and it is unclear if it can employed while is still on the back of a truck. An eight-wheeled Leyland DAF truck equipped with the Demountable Rack Offload and Pickup System (DROPS) capable of relatively quickly loading and unloading containers is seen alongside Gravehawk in the imagery that has now been released. A Leyland DAF DROPS truck with a Gravehawk system seen behind it. UK MoD via Forces News When it comes to targeting, Gravehawk has a retractable sensor system that contains at least one infrared camera, which is used to spot and track targets, and cue the R-73 missiles to them, per Forces News. The main fire control unit fits inside a Pelican-like case as seen below. UK MoD via Forces News As TWZ has previously written about the R-73, also known to NATO as the AA-11 Archer: 'The R-73, in air-launched form, has a maximum range of 18.6 miles against a head-on target of 8.7 miles against a tail-on target. A ground-launched application would have reduced range since the missile wouldn’t benefit from the speed and altitude parameters of the launch aircraft. In this case, it’s perhaps more relevant to look at the seeker range of the R-73, which would remain broadly the same for ground launch: 6.2-7.5 miles.' &#8230; 'The R-73 is a high-off-boresight (HOBS) weapon, with a seeker that can articulate in any direction much farther than a traditional heat-seeking air-to-air missile with a fixed non-HOBS seeker that stares directly forward. Aided by a helmet-mounted sight, the Archer can be launched in air-to-air engagements against targets with off-boresight angles of +/-75 degrees. This gives the R-73 the potential to be a particularly potent, albeit improvised threat for locking onto and engaging dynamic targets with minimal assisting sensors when used in a surface-launched form.' R-73's HOBS seeker looks to be particularly important in this case given that Gravehawk's launch rails otherwise offer a fixed field of fire. There is also a clear relationship between Gravehawk and another FrankenSAM the United Kingdom previously supplied to Ukraine that uses the AIM-132 Advanced Short-Range Air-to-Air Missile (ASRAAM) as its interceptor and that was mounted on a 6&#215;6 Supacat High Mobility Transporter (HMT). Both systems notably appear to use similar, if not identical sensor systems. A side-by-side look at the Gravehawk's sensor system, at left, and the other British-developed surface-to-air missile system for Ukraine that uses the AIM-132, at left. UK MoD via Forces News / Ukrainian Armed Forces Though not necessarily as mobile as the Supacat-based system, Gravehawk's containerized nature does still offer considerable flexibility when it comes to positioning and repositioning it. It also has the benefit of being less obvious as a valuable air defense system while on the move than other types in Ukrainian service. Gravehawk's development is said to have been prompted largely by Russian long-range kamikaze drone and cruise missile threats, which could also point more to static employment defending critical infrastructure. The system is also said to be capable of engaging fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. Bolster Ukraine's air defenses, in general, has been a key focus of the country's Western partner for years now. Earlier on in the conflict, there were concerns that the Ukrainian military's stock of surface-to-air missiles for its existing Soviet-era air defense systems would run dry. The passive nature of the Gravehawk's infrared sensors means that it is not vulnerable to detection by Russian electronic warfare systems, unlike surface-to-air missile systems that rely on active radars. That also means they are unlikely to show up in any electronic order of battle of Ukrainian defenses used for route planning for drone and cruise missile attacks. There is a question of how deep Ukraine's stocks of R-73s, which also arm its MiG-29 Fulcrum and Su-27 Flanker fighters, might be, but the missiles have already been in growing use in the surface-to-air role. In addition to Gravehawk, Ukraine has already fielded modified 9K33 Osa (NATO designation SA-8 Gecko) wheeled air defense vehicles armed with these missiles instead of their usual 9M33 interceptors. The Ukrainian military also has R-73-armed uncrewed surface vessels (USV). Whether or not Gravehawk could be adapted to fire other missiles like the aforementioned AIM-132 or U.S.-made AIM-9 Sidewinders, which Ukraine has also received for air-to-air and surface-to-air use, is unclear. A Ukrainian 9K33 Osa (SA-8) modified to fire R-73 missiles. Come Back Alive A still from a Russian Ministry of Defense video shows a single R-73 on one of two angled rails mounted on the rear of a Ukrainian USV. Russian Ministry of Defense screencap It's also worth noting here that the conflict in Ukraine is not the first time we've seen R-73s and other Soviet-era air-to-air missiles adapted for the air-to-air role. Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen did so years ago. Interestingly, 'the Ukrainians initially didn't want Gravehawk, instead they wanted more air-to-air missiles and F-16 Fighting Falcons,' according to Forces News. 'But having seen it in action they are now apparently sold on it – and want lots more.' Gravehawk's emergence does now come amid newly serious questions about the future of foreign military assistance for Ukraine, especially from the United States. President Donald Trump said today that he will start negotiations to end the conflict with Russia's President Putin. At the latest gathering of the multi-national Ukraine Defense Contact Group earlier today, U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth also said Ukraine's desire to regain territory Russia has occupied since 2014 is unrealistic, as are its ambitions for NATO membership. European partners like the United Kingdom look set to be even more important for Ukraine in the near future. The U.K. Ministry of Defense's initial disclosure of Graveyhawk came as part of an announcement of an additional 4.5 billion pounds ($5.6 billion) in planned military aid for the Ukrainain Forces this year. With Gravehawk already combat-proven, a growing number of them look set to be valuable additions to Ukraine's air defense arsenal and that will allow the country to make expanded use of R-73 missile stockpiles in the surface-to-air role.

EA-18G Growler Crashes Into San Diego Bay	Details remain very limited, but an EA-18G Growler electronic attack jet has crashed off Point Loma, which marks the entrance to San Diego Bay, on Wednesday morning. The sprawling Naval Air Station North Island sits across from Point Loma, with MCAS Miramar located inland roughly 15 miles to the north. A major exercise, the latest iteration of Bamboo Eagle, which you can read all about here, is ongoing off the Southern California coast. It's not clear if the crash is connected to this large-scale training event. San Diego Webcam on X, which has cameras up around the bay, was first to report of the crash. Local ABC affiliate Channel 10 News reports two crew were rescued shortly after the crash. Their crews saw the aircraft crash into the bay. BREAKING: Report of pilot ejection over the bay.

New Shots Of Ukrainian F-16s Shine Light On Combat Missions	Recently emerged imagery of Ukrainian Air Force F-16s shows the fighters carrying a variety of weapons and other stores, apparently in the course of combat sorties, providing an interesting look at the type’s operational service in the war with Russia. The new imagery reveals specific details of load-outs used in operational air-to-air and air-to-ground missions, including some weapons not previously seen on these jets. While the quality of these images varies, the clearest example shows an F-16 apparently returning from a daytime combat air patrol sortie and preparing to land. This seems to have been first posted by the Ukrainian Soniah_Hub channel on the Telegram messaging app. Ukrainian Air Force F-16AM Fighting Falcon returning from a combat air patrol, having expended one of its AIM-120C-series AMRAAM missiles. Appears to be the first confirmation that Ukrainian Falcons are sporting the more advanced and longer-ranged C-series AMRAAMS. pic.twitter.com/oK7TLUOCbW&mdash; OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) February 11, 2025 Seen from below, the fighter is carrying two AIM-9X Sidewinder infrared-guided air-to-air missiles and a single AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM). This suggests that one AMRAAM was expended in combat, although it’s also possible, if far less likely, that the jet may have launched with this asymmetric load. We haven’t previously seen the AIM-9X on Ukrainian F-16s, with earlier imagery showing the jets fitted with the earlier AIM-9L/M. Compared with the AIM-9L/M, the AIM-9X offers a more potent short-range air-to-air missile capability that can be used in conjunction with the F-16’s Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) for high off-boresight (HOBS) engagements. While we know that JHMCS was supplied together with the F-16s, even without it, the AIM-9X is a very valuable weapon that is particularly relevant for defending against drones and cruise missiles. You can read all about employing AIM-9X without a helmet-mounted sight here. A screencap from an official video showing a Ukrainian F-16 pilot wearing JHMCS. Ukrainian Ministry of Defense screencap Another weapon seen for the first time on a Ukrainian F-16 is the AIM-120C version of the AMRAAM, on the left wingtip rail. This version can be identified on account of its cropped fins for internal carriage in the F-22 and F-35. Source- image of a Ukrainian Falcon sporting a more advanced C-series AMRAAM with clipped wings. pic.twitter.com/yMaVwbKiYw&mdash; OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) February 11, 2025 As we’ve discussed in the past, the AIM-120C offers some significant advantages over the earlier AIM-120A/B models. Aside from this, the AMRAAM is significant in that it’s Ukraine’s first active-radar-guided air-to-air missile. This is a class of weapons that was long sought after by Ukraine. One of its fighter pilots, the late Andrii Pilshchykov, better known by his callsign 'Juice,' told TWZ: 'The lack of fire and forget missiles is the greatest problem for us.' A U.S. Air Force F-16C armed with AIM-120C AMRAAM, AIM-9L/M Sidewinder, and AGM-88 HARM missiles. U.S. Air Force The AIM-120C features an improved guidance system and enhanced resistance to countermeasures, although perhaps the single most important factor for Ukraine is its additional range, reportedly a feature of later subvariants (like the AIM-120C-5 and C-7). This would provide the Ukrainian Air Force with a counter of sorts to Russia’s long-range R-37M air-to-air missile. Typical Russian tactics involve firing the R-37M from outside the range of the missiles carried by Ukrainian fighters. While the AIM-120C won’t offer parity with the R-37M, any way of increasing the lethal range of the F-16, as a counter to Russian fighters, will be very welcome. A Russian Su-35S launches an R-37M air-to-air missile. Russian Ministry of Defense The same F-16 is also carrying three external fuel tanks, to maximize its endurance, an especially important factor considering Ukraine has no air-to-air refueling assets. Of poorer quality is a brief video that emerged recently showing an F-16 streaking at low level, purportedly close to the front lines. Earlier today, footage emerged of what is possibly the first sighting of a Ukrainian Air Force F-16AM Fighting Falcon on a strike mission, making a low-level pass. These are the first images of a Ukrainian Falcon sporting a full loadout of US-supplied GBU-39 SDB glide bombs. pic.twitter.com/QTyoBffEJX&mdash; OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) February 10, 2025 A screenshot of the above video, showing an air-to-ground-tasked F-16. via X It’s hard to make out all of the details of the aircraft’s load-out but it appears to be configured for an air-to-ground mission. In particular, stations 3 and 7 under the wings look to be fitted with BRU-61 racks, each of which can carry four GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs (SDBs). The Ukrainian Air Force is already making extensive use of the SDB launched from Soviet-era MiG-29 and Su-27 fighters and it’s not a huge surprise to see the same store being hauled into battle by the F-16. A screencap from a video taken from the cockpit of a Ukrainian Air Force Su-27 shows the fighter lobbing a GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) toward a Russian target. via X via X The SDB offers numerous advantages as an air-to-ground weapon for the F-16. As well as the ability to carry relatively large numbers of these stores, the SDB offers a high level of accuracy and a useful standoff range, and it can be used to strike semi-hardened static targets. Just as importantly, large numbers of SDBs are available in existing NATO stockpiles. Interestingly, the F-16AM version that is being supplied to Ukraine by a coalition of Western partners is not widely associated with the SDB. In fact, it seems that, of the various F-16AM/BM operators, only the Netherlands used the SDB with these MLU-upgraded aircraft. SDBs loaded on a Royal Netherlands Air Force F-16AM. Dutch Ministry of Defense There are also two underwing fuel tanks and an AN/ALQ-131 electronic countermeasures pod carried on the centerline. A podded electronic warfare capability of this kind gives the F-16 a valuable extra layer of survivability, especially important when flying air-to-ground missions in close proximity to the battlefield and its ever-present ground-based air defense threat. As for the ALQ-131, this widely used pod tackles provides self-protection against radar threats, responding to them with a combination of noise, repeater, or transponder electronic jamming techniques. The pod has a modular design and can operate across multiple frequency bands, also being rapidly re-programmed to address changing threats.

Matt Hecht/Released It is especially interesting that the ALQ-131 being carried by this F-16 is just one part of the aircraft’s electronic warfare self-protection suite, reflecting the intensity of the threat. Ukrainian F-16s are also equipped with Pylon Integrated Dispensing System Plus (PIDS+) systems, and perhaps also the more advanced Electronic Combat Integrated Pylon System Plus (ECIPS+), both of which are made by the Terma company in Denmark. Both these pylons are bolt-on self-defense systems that feature missile approach warning sensors (MAWS) that can detect incoming missile threats, while the PIDS+ also has additional dispensers for chaff and flares. The pylons can also provide radar warning and homing receiver capabilities, which give the pilot situational awareness of radar-based threats.

Ukrainian Air Force Rear shot of a Ukrainian F-16 with the Terma self-protection pylon, live AIM-9L/M, and a captive carry (inert) AIM-120B AMRAAM. Ukrainian Ministry of Defense screencap As we have discussed before, prior to their delivery, Ukraine’s F-16s had their electronic warfare systems optimized, with U.S. Air Force assistance, to better defend those jets against Russian threats. As part of ongoing collaboration on this front, the Ukrainians will pass data they collect in combat back to the United States to help further refine and improve electronic warfare capabilities available to both countries, as well as other allies and partners. Defensive weapons appear to comprise two Sidewinders under the wings (these may well be AIM-9L/M versions, in this case) as well as AMRAAMs on the wingtips. Those wingtip stores don’t necessarily look like AMRAAMs, but there doesn’t seem to be any other immediate alternative for this location and what we are probably seeing is the distorted effect of the pixelation and generally lower-quality video. Overall, while it appears the Ukrainian F-16s were introduced to combat primarily in an air defense capacity, especially in the protection of cities and infrastructure against Russian drone and cruise missile attacks, the aircraft is now flying air-to-ground sorties too, making fuller use of its multirole capabilities. The introduction of the F-16 by the Ukrainian Air Force hasn’t been entirely without problems. In August 2024, less than a month after the type was first confirmed as being in the country, Ukraine confirmed the loss of its first F-16 and one of its pilots in a crash during a combat mission. A screencap from an official video showing a Ukrainian F-16 equipped with four AIM-9L/Ms and a Terma self-protection pylon. Ukrainian Ministry of Defense screencap Since then, deliveries of F-16s to Ukraine have been delayed. In particular, deliveries of the F-16s promised by Belgium were expected to begin before the end of 2024, but this has yet to happen. The problem is a lack of trained Ukrainian pilots and spare parts, according to the Belgian Ministry of Defense. Last week, however, it was reported that a batch of former Dutch F-16s had also arrived in Ukraine. In all, around 85 F-16s have now been promised to Ukraine. These comprise 24 from the Netherlands, 19 from Denmark, and 12 from Norway (with the same country providing 10 more that will be used for spare parts), while Belgium says it will supply 30. As more F-16s arrive, and the type becomes better established in Ukrainian service, we should learn more about the kinds of missions that it’s flying. At the same time, with a wide range of potential weapons and stores compatible with the Viper, we’re almost certain to see other and more varied load-outs on these aircraft as they expand their mission profiles.

Algeria Says It’s The Su-57 Felon’s First Export Customer	Algeria’s state-run media has announced that the country is the first export customer for Russia’s Su-57 Felon new-generation fighter. The development follows a statement earlier this week from Russia that an undisclosed foreign customer will start to receive Su-57s this year. The vote of confidence could help improve the fortunes of the Su-57, which has so far suffered from a failed partnership with India and limited Russian orders and deliveries. Information about the Algerian Su-57 order was provided by the country’s state television network, which also reported that Algerian pilots are currently undergoing training on the fighter in Russia. The deliveries are expected to begin later this year, the same source said, although the number of aircraft ordered and the cost of the deal remain unclear. Algerian TV confirms Su-57 fighter jet deal with Russia.'Algerian pilots are training in Russia, and deliveries are expected this year.'Algeria becomes the first Su-57 customer. pic.twitter.com/UGEgFvY92m&mdash; Clash Report (@clashreport) February 12, 2025 On Monday, Rosoboronexport, Russia’s state-run arms export/import agency, said that Su-57s would be delivered to an undisclosed foreign customer starting this year, but provided no details as to that nation’s identity. The statement was made at the opening of the Aero India 2025 international airshow by Rosoboronexport Chief Alexander Mikheev. In November 2024, during Airshow China at Zhuhai, Mikheev also announced the signature of 'the first contracts for the [sale of] Su-57 aircraft' to a foreign country. Again, he declined to name the customer or to discuss any planned delivery schedule. A Su-57 performs at Airshow China 2024, on November 7, 2024, in Zhuhai, Guangdong province. Photo by VCG/VCG via Getty Images qian bai hua Unconfirmed accounts suggest that Algeria may initially be acquiring just six Su-57s. If true, that could suggest that an initial batch will be used for evaluation, or it might be that Russia is able to supply an initial batch of six, with more to follow. Regardless, Russia’s claim that deliveries of Su-57s to a foreign customer will start this year looks questionable. In fact, the Su-57’s sluggish production output is a potentially significant obstacle in terms of export orders — at least if a client requires the aircraft in larger numbers. Although the Felon was first flown in T-50 prototype form back in 2010, the program has made only very slow progress, hampered by a lack of investment in the form of foreign orders. A significant blow was struck by India’s withdrawal from the program, with that country’s investment having been considered vital to speed development. The same had been true in the late 1990s when India’s purchase of the Su-30MKI Flanker essentially secured the development of the multirole version of this fighter, which was only later acquired by Russia. With a Su-57 on static display in the foreground, an Indian Air Force Su-30MKI lands at Aero India 2025, at Yelahanka Air Force Station in Bengaluru, on February 11, 2025. Photo by Arun SANKAR / AFP ARUN SANKAR Meanwhile, the Russian Aerospace Forces only began to receive series-built Su-57s in 2022, part of an order for 76 aircraft — a notably small production run. While at least six aircraft were delivered to the Russian Aerospace Forces in 2022, more than 10 were handed over in 2023 before numbers tailed off again in 2024 when likely only two or three more were received. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and the subsequent international sanctions, have certainly played a role in the slow pace of deliveries, with little prospect that this will change any time soon. Those same sanctions, as well as Moscow’s increasing pariah status, have further reduced the chances of export success. In an effort to drum up foreign interest, Russia has also offered a degree of local production of the Su-57, specifically with the hope of securing sales from India and the United Arab Emirates. Russia has also attempted to use the Su-57’s supposed combat performance — in Syria and Ukraine — as a way to drum up interest in the fighter. However, the apparent operational evaluation in Syria appears to have been of very limited scope, while few hard details have emerged about how the Su-57 has been used in the war in Ukraine. Most notably, perhaps, at least one and maybe two Su-57s were struck by Ukrainian drones at an air base deep inside Russia, as you can read about here. Before and after satellite images published by the Ukrainian Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR) of a strike on a Russian Su-57 at Akhtubinsk on June 8, 2024. GUR Another hurdle is the fact that the export version of the Felon — the Su-57E — has yet to appear in hardware form. While the ‘Su-57E’ has been presented at airshows previously — notably at Zhuhai — the aircraft was actually the fourth T-50 prototype. As the export version, the Su-57E is likely to be somewhat downgraded, as well as having a different identification friend or foe (IFF) system, and cockpit displays calibrated in Imperial units and the English language. In the past, it’s been suggested that non-Russian weapons could be integrated if required. With this in mind, the Su-57E is certainly more achievable than the advanced Su-57M version, which has long been promised but has so far made little tangible progress. Central to the Su-57M is the new AL-51F-1 (izdeliye 30) turbofan engine, replacing the current AL-41F-1, with increased thrust, lighter weight, and lower operating costs. This, too, has moved at a glacial pace, not helped by the low level of interest from Russia, let alone on the export market. A view of the flat version of the thrust-vectoring nozzle developed for the AL-51F1 (in the left engine nacelle), alongside the original three-dimensional version (right nacelle). via X For the Algerian Air Force, however, the Su-57E would be a significant advance, reinforcing its status as the most powerful air arm in the region. With its reduced radar signature, supersonic cruising speed, high level of agility, and advanced sensor suite, the Su-57 provides a combination of capabilities not found in any other African air arm. The backbone of the Algerian Air Force has long been provided by Russian-made equipment, currently including 63 Su-30MKA and 40 MiG-29S/M/M2 multirole fighters, 42 Su-24MK2 strike/reconnaissance aircraft, and 16 Yak-130 combat trainers. It also operates 33 Russian-made Mi-24 Mk III and 42 Mi-28NE attack helicopters. All those figures are for 2024 and are published by FlightGlobal. This has all been enabled by the highest level of defense spending in Africa, supported by one of the continent’s largest economies in Africa, due mostly to its large oil and gas reserves. Traditionally, the Algerian Air Force has been built up to face off the potential threat from Morocco, with which Algeria went to war over the contested Western Sahara region, in 1976. In the 1990s, Algeria was engaged in a civil war, pitting the armed forces against various Islamist rebel groups. Beginning in the 2000s, meanwhile, the armed forces have fought with Al-Qaeda in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb or AQIM, an Islamist militant organization that aims to overthrow the Algerian government and institute an Islamic state. Buying the Su-57 reinforces the Algerian Air Force’s capabilities vis-à-vis Morocco, which has been approved to buy 25 new F-16 Block 72s, as well as an upgrade package to bring that country’s existing Viper fleet up to the very similar F-16V standard. At the same time, it further underlines Algeria’s defense ties with Russia. Four Moroccan F-16s sit on the runway prior to takeoff at Ben Guerir Air Base, Morocco, during Exercise African Lion 2021. U.S. Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Thomas S. Keisler IV Airman 1st Class Thomas Keisler It remains to be seen how many Su-57s Algeria will acquire and when they start to be delivered. But even a small number would be a shot in the arm for the Su-57 program, which has so far struggled to gain traction on the export market, not helped by the slow pace of the program and Russia’s reluctance to order it in more significant numbers.

C-17’s ‘Silver Bullet’ Airstream Trailer Pod Used By Secretary Of...	During his first overseas flight as Defense Secretary, Pete Hegseth shared a video of himself aboard a C-17 Globemaster III transport jet sitting in a Silver Bullet Command and Control Module. The converted Airstream trailer is one of two the Air Force deploys to give senior leaders like Hegseth and other VVIPs a secure, quiet place to conduct business in the middle of a noisy, often-crowded cargo aircraft. The Silver Bullets’ days are numbered though. For a host of reasons, a replacement unit called the Roll-On Conference Capsule (ROCC) is scheduled to be fielded in December, the Air Force told us today. Unlike the adapted Silver Bullets, which first flew in the early 1990s, these were purpose-built for the mission. The short video showed Hegseth sitting on a brown leather chair at a small workstation inside the Silver Bullet, where he signed an order changing the name of Fort Liberty in North Carolina to Fort Roland L. Bragg. It was during a long flight from Joint Base Andrews (JBA) in Maryland to Germany, where he visited U.S. Africa Command and U.S. European Command in Stuttgart on Tuesday before heading to Brussels to discuss the future of U.S. support for Ukraine with NATO allies. Bragg is back!

In addition to giving Hegseth a place to do his job as defense secretary, the Silver Bullet - at best a homey hideaway reminiscent of a 1990s motorhome - also offered him a place to rest. SECDEF Hegseth at his desk in the Silver Bullet. (DOD Screencap) Dick Cheney in the Silver Bullet at the same desk areas as Hegseth. (The U.S. National Archives) The Silver Bullet 'was certainly comfortable and provided a relatively quiet place to work and concentrate.' Joseph Votel, the retired Army general who commanded U.S. Central Command from 2016 to 2019, told The War Zone in a 2022 story about the modules. 'As a combatant commander, I had a need to stay in constant communications even during lengthy travel to the Middle East and do it in a place that I could work from. Purpose-designed aircraft and some other capabilities made available to us helped to make that possible — it was a multiplier for me. In the end – I just needed to be able to operate.'

(DOD photo) The Silver Bullet is essentially a mobile SCIF, office, and apartment all in one. An arsenal of communications tech has been continuously upgraded that works to connect the pod to the outside world. This includes multiple options for unsecure and secure voice, data, and video teleconferencing. These systems 'plug in' to the existing communications systems aboard a select number of C-17s via a set of umbilical cables. There is a large 'mechanical caboose' that brings up the rear of the palleted Silver Bullet system where the communications technology and controls that support the pod are held and where the pod’s electronics are interfaced with the C-17. The updated version of this enclosure is called the 'Silver Eagle' and it can support communications at the very highest levels. Above all else, this includes being able to connect with the National Command Authority which underpins America's nuclear deterrent, anywhere and anytime. A very rare view inside the 'Silver Eagle. (SelectTech) We reached out to the Pentagon to see how Hegseth liked the Silver Bullet, which like its twin is owned by Air Mobility Command and maintained by the 89th Maintenance Group at JBA. It was by chance, meanwhile, that Hegseth flew the Globemaster on his maiden voyage as SECDEF. He was scheduled to fly one of the four existing E-4B Survivable Airborne Operations Center jets. 'Occasionally, due to routine scheduled maintenance, the small fleet of four aircraft cannot support additional tasking such as SecDef travel. In such cases, it is not uncommon for the SecDef to be supported with an alternative type of aircraft,' Justin R. Oakes, spokesman for the Eighth Air Force and the Joint-Global Strike Operations Center told us earlier this week. In addition to better availability, the Globemasters have another advantage over the E-4Bs. They have a defensive suite includes multiple types of expendable decoys and the laser-based Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasure System (LAIRCM). This system uses staring missile launch detectors arrayed around the aircraft that alert the crew of an incoming missile via detection of the missile’s infrared plume and cue a number of laser turrets positioned around the jet’s fuselage to fire their blinding beams into the missile’s infrared seeker. This capability makes using the Silver Bullet a requirement for traveling into hostile locales. An Air Force E-4B flies over the Canadian Pacific Coast April 10, 2014. .

This shot gives us a good look at the E-4's spine, which is festooned with antennas. (U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Mary O'Dell) Regardless, Hegseth has only about 10 more months to use the Silver Bullets. They are scheduled to be retired and replaced by the newer, safer ROCCs. In 2019, the Air Force awarded an $8.5 million contract to SelectTech Services Corp. of Centerville, Ohio, for the design, development, integration, test and delivery of two ROCCs to replace the aging Airstream units. As we noted in our previous coverage, the Silver Bullets were considered so unsafe they were deemed not airworthy back in 2000. It wasn’t until 2020 that the flying branch issued a memo authorizing occupancy of the modules, except during takeoffs and landings, refueling and 'moderate turbulence in flight as determined by the aircraft commander,' Air Force officials told The War Zone. The Silver Bullets 'did not meet the numerous airworthiness requirements, including crash loads, egress, gusts loads, electrical system design, smoke and fumes, etc.,' the Air Force explained to us in 2022. In addition, a 2015 Air Force assessment 'identified numerous risks which were generally associated with substandard electrical system design, improper use of materials for an aircraft environment, and inadequate structural design integrity for crash scenarios, hard landings, and turbulence in flight.' The situation was of great enough concern that the House Armed Services Committee in its markup of the Fiscal Year 2023 National Defense Authorization Act asked the Air Force Secretary for a full report by March 2023 on the Silver Bullet’s problems and plan for replacement.

Hagel returned to Washington from his first visit to Afghanistan as Secretary of Defense on Monday. (AP Photo/Jason Reed, Pool) The ROCC is designed to mitigate those concerns, the Air Force told us. 'The intent is for [the ROCC] to be fully certified for all phases of flight when it is fielded,' Air Force Capt. Denise Guiao-Corpuz told us.' Those modules will have 'intercom systems, lavatories, Ethernet network, Wi-Fi, VTC system display, external voice and data connectivity (wideband or narrowband), 120V/60Hz outlets, sleeping quarters, and a 9-person conference room,' according to SelectTech. The new Roll-On Conference Capsule from SelecTech will replace the Silver Bullet.

(SelectTech graphic) The Silver Bullets have a storied past, hosting U.S. cabinet members, service secretaries, other military leaders, vice presidents, and even celebrities like Robin Williams and Drew Carey. Considering their significance, these unique but dated VVIP pods will hopefully find their way into museums.

Mystery Tiltrotor Aircraft Emerges	What looks to be a previously unseen vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) capable aircraft design with a mix of tilting and fixed rotors has emerged at the Mojave Air and Space Port in California. Mojave is a hotbed for aviation development where testing of new and often intriguing designs, including VTOL types, regularly occurs. Photographer Matt Hartman took the pictures seen above and below of the unusual aircraft at Mojave yesterday and posted them on social media. The aircraft was sitting outside a hangar on the eastern side of the main apron area, according to Hartman. Several aviation companies have a permanent presence at Mojave and the U.S. military also makes use of its facilities. and here the #EVTOL oddball of the week seen at MHV! No id or idea on this one… #avGeek #VTOL 02-10-25 pic.twitter.com/5oWXKnvWd4&mdash; Matt Hartman (@ShorealoneFilms) February 11, 2025 No identifying markings are readily visible on the aircraft and it is unpainted in its primer coating. It is also physically anchored to the ground and hoses are seen snaking down from the nacelles holding the rotors, all of which is common to see during ground testing of VTOL designs. Matt Hartman From what can otherwise be seen in Hartman's pictures, the design has six rotor assemblies. There are two larger ones in tilting nacelle pods at the wingtips and two pairs of smaller ones that appear to be fixed vertically in nacelles built into the high-mounted wing. A single horizontal trapezoidal tail points to a twin-boom tail configuration is also visible. Matt Hartman A closer look at the three rotor assemblies on the right wing. Matt Hartman There is a central fuselage with a front windscreen with two distinct halves, pointing to side-by-side seating, at least for individuals up front. A large doorway is also seen on the left side of the forward fuselage. A tricycle landing gear arrangement consisting of a nose wheel and two main wheels attached to struts sticking out from the sides of the rear of the fuselage is visible, as well. In some very broad respects, it almost looks like a mashup of the OV-10 Bronco light attack and observation aircraft and the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor. An ever closer look at the front of the mystery VTOL aircraft. Matt Hartman Though what kind of propulsion system the design might have is unknown, the wingtip nacelle pods at least have exhausts pointing to turbine engines, which could drive the rotors directly or produce electricity to run electric motors that drive these rotors. They could also drive the wing rotor via mechanical linkages or by providing electronic power to their motors. Additional turbines might also be present in the wing nacelles to provide power to those rotors, either mechanically or electrically, but they would have to be small and this seems less likely to be the case. A hybrid-electric design where turbines provide electricity to at least some of the rotors would be a particularly big deal as this is still an emerging technology space, especially for the U.S. military, if it is involved with this design at all. The market space for hybrid and electric VTOL designs, crewed and uncrewed, and intended for civilian and/or military use, has exploded in recent years in the United States and globally. In April 2024, the independent Vertical Flight Society said its database of distinct electric VTOL, or eVTOL, concepts had hit 1,000 entries. Many such designs have been tested at Mojave. The Air Force's Agility Prime program, which began in 2020, is perhaps the best-known example of recent U.S. military efforts in this space. Run through AFWERX, the service's internal technology incubator, Agility Prime has been experimenting with a variety of eVTOL designs, including types from Beta Technologies, Joby Aviation, and LIFT Aircraft. In December, Aviation Week reported that persistent range limitations with existing eVTOL designs had prompted Agility Prime to refocus its efforts on hybrid-electric types. For the U.S. military, interest in new VTOL aircraft designs, including the active development of types with more traditional propulsion arrangements, is being driven in part by a desire for greater runway independence amid concerns about the growing vulnerability of air bases, as well as other established facilities, during a future high-end conflict. This, in turn, has led to the development of new concepts of operations focused heavily on expeditionary and distributed operations, including in remote and austere sites with limited existing infrastructure. New VTOL designs, especially uncrewed ones, are also increasingly viewed as important components of future supply chains for forces in forward areas, including right on the front lines. Casualty evacuation and the extraction of downed pilots, including from behind enemy lines, have also been presented as potential roles for such aircraft. There is also considerable civilian interest in hybrid-powered and eVTOL designs, including from commercial operators eyeing them for use as air taxis. While we don't know if the aircraft that has now emerged at Mojave is intended for civilian or military use, or both, it does appear to be quite elaborate overall. Larger tilt-rotor designs also remain rare among civilian-focused general mobility concepts. TWZ will be keeping an eye out for more information about this VTOL aircraft and what its projected roles might be.

Russian Military Convoy Blocked From Entering Port Of Tartus In S...	A Russian military convoy was reportedly prevented from entering Tartus naval base in Syria. This is the latest indication of estrangement between the two erstwhile allies. The move came amid the ongoing withdrawal of Russian forces from Tartus in the wake of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham’s (HTS) sudden overthrow of dictator Bashar Al Assad late last year. 'The Syrian Defense Ministry has prevented a Russian military convoy from entering the Tartus base,' the Turkish TRT media outlet reported on Tuesday. 'A column of 30 missile-armed vehicles that set out in the morning from the Khmeimim airbase in Latakia province was stopped at a checkpoint in Tartus by troops subordinate to the new Syrian government. After waiting at the checkpoint for eight hours, the convoy was forced to return to the Khmeimim base at around 5 p.m. local time.' Video emerging on social media showed Syrian forces ordering the convoy to turn around and head back to Khmeimim. The trucks appear to be caring missiles in their launch tubes. Syrian Arab Army blocked a Russian military convoy of around 35 military vehicles loaded with air defense missiles and various weapons from entering the city of #Tartus this evening, and the convoy was forced to turn back towards the Hmeimim base in the countryside of Latakia. pic.twitter.com/KBzT1GFabg&mdash; Mete Sohtaoğlu (@metesohtaoglu) February 11, 2025 Russians have frequently traveled this route to move equipment and supplies from Khmeimim, their master airbase in Syria, to Tartus, where they had a major naval facility prior to the fall of Assad, and vice versa, as you can see in the following videos.

However, TRT noted that it took place 'amid recent statements by the Defense Minister of the transitional government of Syria, Murhaf Abu Kasra, that the preservation of Russian bases would depend on their benefits for Syria.' 'If we benefit from this for Syria, then yes,' the Russians could remain there, Abu Kasra was quoted as saying. Negotiations between Moscow and Damascus over the future of Russian bases in Syria 'are almost certainly ongoing,' according to an assessment yesterday by the U.K.’s Defense Intelligence. 'Russia almost certainly continues to actively engage HTS to develop ties and promote itself as a beneficial partner,' the assessment suggested. 'However, Russia's negotiating position is weaker due to various factors, including, probably, the Syrian leadership's hostile attitude towards former Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, who is now being sheltered by Russia.' Latest Defence intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 10 February 2025.Find out more about Defence Intelligence's use of language: #StandWithUkraine pic.twitter.com/OxmN2jHVw9&mdash; Ministry of Defence (@DefenceHQ) February 10, 2025 Despite continuing its withdrawal from Syria, Russia still has a keen interest in maintaining a presence there. Having a port and air base on the Mediterranean gives it the ability to project tactical and strategic power into NATO's backyard, as well as into Africa and deeper into the Middle East. Syria, meanwhile, could possibly benefit from the return of Russia’s advanced air defense systems to the country helping to protect its skies. Adding to the complexity of this issue, Turkey, which backed HTS’ surprise overthrow of Assad, also wants to further assert its influence over Syria. Turkish journalist Mete Sohtaoğlu told us that no deal has yet been reached between Moscow and Damascus in part due to pressure from Ankara. The recent activity in and around Tartus also follows reports from Syrian media that the country’s fledgling government in Damascus canceled Russia’s 49-year lease agreement for its base in Tartus. The Kremlin had struck the deal back in 2017 with the Assad regime, which had essentially gifted the naval facility, as well as Khmeimim Air Base, to the Russians. Two years earlier, Russia’s military launched an intervention in the country, which had saved Assad from advancing rebel forces. Russian forces were still actively fighting rebel forces, including elements of the coalition led by HTS that ultimately deposed Assad, right up until the collapse of the regime. The port of Tartus in Syria is strategically located along the Mediterranean Sea and near Africa. (Google Earth) As part of the Russian withdrawal from Tartus, two Russian-flagged roll-on/roll-off (RO/RO) cargo ships - Sparta and Sparta II - were loaded with equipment. They transited the Strait of Gibraltar and are both currently located off the coast of Spain yesterday, according to the MarineTraffic.com vessel tracking website. Sparta is bound for St. Petersburg, according to MarineTraffic.com while Sparta II is headed for the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. As we previously reported, satellite imagery taken on Jan. 25 that TWZ obtained from Maxar, showed those RO/ROs docked in Tartus amid cargo loading activity. The two ships had been holding offshore for days before finally being allowed to enter the port. A satellite image taken on Jan. 25, 2025, showed Sparta and Sparta II docked in Syria’s port of Tartus. (Satellite image ©2025 Maxar Technologies) The images also showed the disappearance of a significant number of Russian vehicles and other materiel from a pier where they had been marshaled weeks ago. You can read more about that in our initial report here. A look at a section of one of the piers at Tartus where Russian assets had been had been marshaled weeks ago showing the disappearance of various vehicles and other materiel. (Satellite image ©2025 Maxar Technologies) It remains to be seen whether Syria will allow Russia to remain at Tartus and Khmeimim. Being able to turn around an armed convoy from Tartus highlights that Damascus has the upper hand in any negotiations over the future of those two facilities.

Tankers Flood Airspace Off The California Coast For China-Focused...	At least 20 U.S. Air Force tanker aircraft, 10 KC-46s and an equal number of KC-135s, supported the first day of the latest Bamboo Eagle exercise off the California Coast, according to online flight tracking data. The first Bamboo Eagle occurred last year, as you can learn more about in this past TWZ feature. The large force exercise series has quickly become one of the most important for the U.S. military, as well as key allies, and has a clear eye on preparing for a future coalition fight in the Pacific with China. A stock picture of a US Air Force KC-46 tanker. USAF The U.S. Air Force announced the start of Bamboo Eagle 25-1 yesterday. Like all previous iterations, the U.S. Air Force Warfare Center (USAFWC) at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada has been leading the exercise, but units spread across many other bases, predominantly in California, are also participating. U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy units are known to be taking part, but other branches have also been included in past iterations of Bamboo Eagle. Britain's Royal Air Force (RAF) and the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) have also returned and the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) has joined the exercise for the first time.

It's interesting to note here that the U.S. Air Force, the RAF, and NATO are in the process of acquiring Wedgetails to succeed their Sentry fleets. An RAAF E-7A takes off from Nellis as part of an earlier exercise in 2024.

However, Rivet Joints have been recently tracked flying over the Pacific off southern California, as well as elsewhere in the southwestern United States, as part of a surge of U.S. military support to border security operations opposite Mexico. Not visible in the online flight tracking data from yesterday or today are the huge numbers of tactical jets that the tankers and other supporting aircraft were working with. In its announcement about the start of Bamboo Eagle 25-1, the Air Force included pictures of Air Force F-35A and RAF Typhoon FGR4 fighters, as well as Navy EA-18G Growler electronic warfare jets, taking part in Red Flag 25-1 at Nellis. Red Flag is the U.S. Air Force’s premier air combat exercise series and recent iterations have been increasingly focused on operations in the Pacific. This in turn has put new emphasis on the range complexes off the coast of southern California, which offer larger areas in which to train on physically broader and otherwise more complex scenarios, and do so over water. Red Flag is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year and the RAF and RAAF, among other key allies, are often participants. Other aircraft, including Air Force F-15E Strike Eagles and B-2 Spirit stealth bombers, as well as RAAF Growlers, took part in Red Flag 25-1, which flowed directly into Bamboo Eagle 25-1.

USAF An RAAF EA-18G taking part in Red Flag 25-1. USAF Senior Airman Makenna Patterson 'This is the largest number of aircraft we’ve deployed for an exercise at Nellis (AFB) since we first attended Red Flag in 1980,' RAAF Group Captain Stewart Seeney said in a statement yesterday. 'These exercises provide a realistic training environment where we can integrate different capabilities and develop our ability to work with key allies and partners. For many of our aviators, deploying on these exercises is a career highlight and is not an experience that can be easily replicated elsewhere.' F-35As from Hill Air Force Base in Utah are also notably operating from Naval Air Station North Island in California as part of the exercise. The Navy facility has been used as a staging point in past iterations of Bamboo Eagle. Air Force units using it for this purpose also have the opportunity to train around still-evolving rapid deployment and related concepts of operations, currently referred to collectively as Agile Combat Employment (ACE), which the service has been working on for years now. ACE has been and continues to be a central focus for Bamboo Eagle exercises, in general. A US Air Force F-35A assigned to the 388th Fighter Wing at Hill Air Force Base at Naval Air Station North Island taking part in Bamboo Eagle 25-1. USAF Micah Garbarino 'We have had the luxury of operating from safe haven bases for many decades, and modern threats have fundamentally changed that reality,' Air Force Maj. Gen. Christopher Niemi, head of USAFWC also said in a statement. 'Bamboo Eagle is a big part of helping us figure out how to manage those threats, and training together with our allies improves our ability to face those threats as a unified team.' Other branches of the U.S. military, especially the U.S. Marine Corps, have been developing similar concepts of operations all centered heavily on ways to quickly deploy and redeploy forces throughout forward areas to upend enemy targeting cycles. Concerns about access to established bases, especially in the context of a potential future high-end fight in the Pacific, have been particular drivers of these efforts. There are growing calls for the U.S. military to do more to physically harden bases in the Pacific, along with other defensive improvements, which you can read more about here. A US Air Force F-16 Viper fighter sits inside a hardened aircraft shelter. USAF The prospect of a major conflict with China in the Pacific, where bases on the ground may be few and far between, has also been contributing to concerns about overall aerial refueling capacity, as well as the vulnerability of existing tankers. What has been seen from Bamboo Eagle 25-1 already underscores the critical importance of aerial refueling, especially for supporting shorter-legged tactical jets. The Air Force is in the process of refining requirements for new stealth tankers and has also been exploring more novel options for increasing aerial refueling capacity. The Navy and Marine Corps, which have the added planning consideration of expeditionary aviation operations from carriers and other big deck ships, are also acutely aware of the issues at play. The Navy is planning to add MQ-25 Stingray drone tankers to its carrier air wings in the coming years and there is also interest in new options for extending the ranges of existing tactical jets. Private contractors, which can provide aerial refueling support for non-combat missions and help free up organic U.S. military tankers in the process, are another steadily growing part of the equation. There is significant uncertainty around future defense spending plans under President Donald Trump's new administration, especially when it comes to Air Force modernization priorities like stealth tankers and other next-generation aircraft that were already facing affordability concerns.

Lockheed Martin Skunk Works Bamboo Eagle 25-1 also comes ahead of Air Force plans to stage a massive air combat exercise across reperetantive operating areas in the Pacific this summer, which you can read more about here. Dubbed REFORPAC, the exercise is expected to last some two weeks, days of which will be spent just getting forces to and from operating locations, underscoring the basic geographical challenges the region presents. At least some units taking part in REFORPAC are expected to go almost straight from that exercise into another iteration of Bamboo Eagle, as well. A map Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Allvin shared together with the details about the REFORPAC exercise during a talk at the Hudson Institute in 2024.

Navy Growler’s Next-Generation Jamming Pod Went To War On Its Fir...	The Navy’s new AN/ALQ-249(V)1 Next Generation Jammer-Mid Band (NGJ-MB) electronic warfare pods have completed their maiden deployment with an E/A-18G Growler squadron. The pods went on cruise with Electronic Attack Squadron 133 (VAQ-133) to the highly tumulteous Red Sea and Gulf of Aden with the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group (CSG) last year, with the carrier returning home in time for the holidays. TWZ spoke this month with two of the top officers involved in the NGJ-MB effort to get a sense of how the pods performed, what’s next for the system and the decision-making process behind fielding the ALQ-249 last year, even as formal Pentagon testing and evaluation remained incomplete. Details about the ALQ-249 pod’s capabilities remain limited. Cmdr. Erik Dente, VAQ-133’s commanding officer, declined to comment on precisely how the NGJ-MB pods performed on deployment, or the target sets they took on against the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen.

(U.S. Navy) Capt. David Rueter, program manager for airborne electronic attack systems at Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), also declined to talk specifics, but he noted how the ALQ-249 represents 'a quantum leap in where we are with airborne electronic attack.' 'They performed as expected, or maybe even a little better than I expected,' Rueter said of the ALQ-249 pods. 'When you’re developing a program, you have an idea how you think it’s going to be employed, between hangar bay, flight deck, cyclic ops, that kind of stuff. And then what actually happens is probably not the exact scenario you plan for.' Rueter added that his team will be traveling to the squadron this week to get more feedback on how the NGJ performed. Dente called the transition to the new pods 'pretty seamless.' The AN/ALQ-249 Next Generation Jammer is seen under the outer wing of an E/A-18G Growler. (U.S. Navy) 'I won’t get into specifics about pod performance,' he said. 'I will say it’s always a challenging thing about a brand new system … Those challenges, to me, largely spoke to what that system is capable of.' While the Navy has remained mum about what precisely the ALQ-240 can do, manufacturer Raytheon describes the NGJ-MB as 'an advanced electronic attack system that denies, disrupts and degrades enemy technology, including communication tools and air-defense systems.' Its capabilities include 'operating at significantly enhanced ranges' and 'attacking multiple targets simultaneously.' The Navy's AN/ALQ-249 Next Generation Jammer. (Raytheon) They are replacing the legacy AN/ALQ-99 pods, which first entered service in the early 1970s and have received upgrades since then, even as officials concede that upgrade capacity on the ‘-99s’ is running out. 'We realized years ago that we've kind of maxed out the ALQ-99 form factor,' Rueter said. 'So next gen jammer really brings us up into modern and evolving threats. So much more modern architecture, more capacity than ALQ-99, more power and certainly more capability.' ALQ-249 pods are designed to improve EA-18G capabilities against modern, advanced radiofrequency (RF) threats — namely air defenses — as well as communications, datalinks, and non-traditional RF targets. The pods also offer the Navy a new way 'to deny, degrade, or deceive the enemy’s use of the electromagnetic spectrum by employing both reactive and preemptive jamming techniques while enhancing the friendly force’s use of the electromagnetic spectrum,' a Pentagon report assessing the capability states. You can read our assessment of how the new pods could provide additional capabilities here. The AN/ALQ-99 pod. (Hunini via Wikicommons) The NGJ-MB’s use of multiple active electronically scanned arrays (AESA), something not found on the older ALQ-99s jammers, as well as its modular open architecture design, could open the door to a variety of new and improved capabilities. General configuration of the NGJ-MB pod, with its ram-air power generator and two AESAs on each end. (U.S. Navy) During past U.S. operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, it emerged that Growlers, as well as the EA-6B Prowlers they replaced, had been using their electronic warfare suites to prevent militants from remotely detonating improvised explosive devices. The bottom line is that these new pods have capabilities we do not know anything about and the tactics behind their use are rapidly evolving. Marines and their EA-6B Prowler jets at al-Udeid Air Base, Qatar, in 2018, before the air frame's retirement. (U.S. Navy) As its name indicates, the NGJ-MB pods are only designed to work in certain frequency bands. L3 Harris has been developing an entirely separate NGJ-Low Band (NGJ-LB) pod to complement the mid-band ones. There are also high and low-band versions of the ALQ-99, and Rueter told TWZ that the service’s priorities for next-generation jammers are midband first, then low band and eventually high band. 'I'll say high band is still on the to do list, but it's prioritized appropriately, and we'll get to it eventually,' he said. A US Navy briefing slide outlining the service’s plans for the Next-Generation Jammer program as a whole. (U.S. Navy) While VAQ-133 was the first unit to deploy with the pods, Rueter said an initial ship set was sent to them at the onset of their pre-deployment workups, to get the air crew familiar with the new system. 'We really tried hard to get their air crew and their maintainers trained, and give them at least one ship set from the very beginning,' he said. 'So they were actually flying with NGJ mid band for a little under a year before they actually deployed.' Nothing much changed on the pre-deployment workups side with the arrival of the NGJ-MB, Dente said, it was just new technology to incorporate. The new jammer pods are loaded and offloaded onto the Growler depending on mission requirements, and Dente said his squadron noted very little change when it came to handling and operating the AN/ALQ-249, although incorporating the new tech into the unit and getting everyone trained up on the system before deployment took some time. 'How we operated is largely similar,' he said. 'There’s just some differences in basic admin of the pod, turning it on and off, those things are a little bit different, but generally speaking, employment and operation is similar.' Because the new jammers pods were still going through operational testing, Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 9 (VX-9) designated VAQ-133 as 'adjunct testers' as they began fielding the AN/ALQ-249, Rueter said. 'So 133 was able to do that, and VX-9 was able to leverage any data from 133 to help augment operational tests,' he said. Sending the NGJ-MB out into the fleet provided invaluable feedback to the Navy regarding how the new pods hold up to the stressors of a combat deployment, Rueter added. 'It’s just the pure number of flight hours,' he said. 'We put a lot of hours on in test, but we cannot do what the fleet does. The fleet probably puts more hours on in a month than we do in a year in developmental and operational test.'

(U.S. Navy) Deploying the NGJ-MB aboard a flattop in a combat environment for the first time presented its own unique challenges, according to VAQ-133 CO Dente. 'Saltwater environment, being out to sea, how do these things live on an aircraft carrier with us?' he said. 'It takes adaptation … because not only do we have to worry about the safety challenges that are always presented by new equipment being stored on an aircraft carrier, but we also have to learn how to keep the system itself safe from bumps, bruises, scuffs and normal day-to-day hazards that operations on an aircraft carrier present.' Sailors remove chocks and chains from an EA-18G Growler armed with NGJ pods. (U.S. Navy) While ALQ-249 now has its first deployment under its belt, the latest Director, Operational Test & Evaluation (DOT&E) Pentagon report released this month highlighted challenges the service has faced with ALQ-249 development in the past year. 'Technical challenges were significant during the course of all testing in FY24,' the report states. 'Specifically, reliability has been a clear challenge during the course of the program development, to the point of affecting suitability and the ability to assess the performance of the system overall. Early reliability issues were predominantly hardware related, but after further development and implementation of fixes, the remaining issues appear to be mostly software centric. Although data are still insufficient to fully assess the reliability of the system, data trends have been markedly improving, suggesting the potential for a strong positive reversal in the future.' Rueter called the DOT&E assessment 'fair,' and said that previous development programs have followed such a progression. 'The hardware failures, or the hardware things, kind of mask the software,' he said. 'So the first thing you do is get the hardware reliable, then you start working on the software. And like [DOT&E] said, we have seen great improvements in our reliability over the last year.' EA-18G Growlers attached to Electronic Attack Squadron (VAQ) 133, arrive home to Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Washington, in December. (U.S. Navy) The decision-making calculus remains unclear regarding the Navy choosing to deploy the new jammer pods despite this initial testing and evaluation not being completed. Naval Air Forces officials did not answer TWZ questions about the decision to send the capability into the hectic skies over the Red Sea, where the Navy has battled Iran-backed Houthi rebel missile and drone barrages for more than a year. Rueter deferred questions about sending the pods out with VAQ-133 to the fleet, but noted how the squadron got their first pod set during pre-deployment workups and chose which pods to affix to the jet depending on the mission. Growlers can carry both at the same time. 'The midband pods are carried on the wings, and then the ALQ-99 are on centerline,' he said. Sending a system out for some real-world application before testing is completed is 'happening more and more,' Rueter said. As TWZ previously reported, the latest DOT&E report also showcased how the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier undertook its first full deployment in 2023, even as multiple systems aboard that first-in-class flattop had yet to be fully assessed. 'I won’t speculate as to why it’s happening more and more, but yeah, I think we are seeing more and more systems that are fielded by the services before all initial operational tests are complete,' Rueter said. 'I think the days of having a large, dedicated [Initial Operational Test & Evaluation (IOT&E)] period, that we wait until that whole period is done, those days are probably behind us, and we need to get a much more agile, continuous operational test cycle.' While not a program office function, Rueter said the squadron’s air crew was calling back to stateside testers for technical questions as they planned different operations. Another unidentified Growler squadron has also received the new jammer. Under an existing agreement, the Royal Australian Air Force’s (RAAF) No. 6 Squadron is also slated to get the NGJ 'in the near future,' he said. A Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) E/A-18G Growler. (RAAF) 'They’ve already completed maintenance and air crew training, and they’re getting ready to accept the ship set,' he said. 'The program now, one part of it is production and fielding, along with, we’ve got a continual improvement development program.' Rueter wants to get the NGJ to a point where the Navy can send out four software updates a year, to keep the system more reliable, add new capabilities and mitigate software anomalies that pop up. 'I tell the team here, look at ALQ-99, it’s been flying for 50-plus years,' he said. 'You need to have the mindset that ALQ-249 is going to fly for 50 years, and you’re going to continually upgrade it so we can continue to pace and stay ahead of the threat.' Meanwhile, Rueter said his team is looking hard at getting electronic warfare to a place where systems leverage 'cognitive electronic warfare' and can be updated in real time, or close to it. 'I can't talk about specific systems or anything, but I'll say, as an electronic warfare practitioner for going on 27 years now, I think that is definitely one of the areas we need to move in,' he said. 'Artificial intelligence and machine learning brings a lot of capabilities that we haven't really had access to before, and one of our charges here in the program office is to figure out what do they bring that we didn't have before, and how can we use that to give the fleet better tools.' A VAQ-133 Growler assigned to the USS Abraham Lincoln with the AN/ALQ-249 Next Generation Jammer-Mid Band (NGJ-MB) pods under its wings. (U.S. Navy) Since the Air Force retired the EF-111A in 1998, the Navy has been the only disclosed operator of dedicated fast-jet tactical electronic warfare capability within the U.S. military, and is therefore tasked with providing such support across the branches. Rueter said he welcomes any collaboration with other platforms or services that helps him put the 'fog' into the fog of war when it comes to airborne electronic attack (AEA). 'While a majority of the systems we work on fly on a Growler today, I want to be the center of excellence, if you will, for all offensive electronic attack,' he said. 'Another platform, whether it's an [unmanned aerial drone], whether it's a different manned aircraft, whether it's a surface vessel, I'd like to think if they want to project some sort of electronic attack effect, they could come to us. We've already got a long lineage of people developing jammer techniques. Other people might refer to them as electronic warfare skills. So we've got a lot of experience and are happy to build payloads for whoever wants to do AEA.' The NGJ has now deployed, contributed to combat operations and returned home. Meanwhile, the importance of such capabilities will only continue to grow in a warscape that places an increasingly imperative on dominating the electronic spectrum.

French Fighters Downed 'Nearly A Dozen Drones' In Red Sea Combat	French Air and Space Force Mirage 2000-5F and Rafale fighters shot down 'nearly a dozen drones' in recent combat operations over and around the Red Sea, the head of that service has confirmed. The announcement comes soon after the first French-supplied Mirage 2000-5Fs arrived in Ukraine, where they will be expected to face similar threats, in the form of Russian-operated long-range one-way attack drones. 'In the Air and Space Force, both the Mirage 2000-5 and the Rafale recently demonstrated their effectiveness against Shahed-type suicide drones, against which Ukrainian pilots will have to fight,' Jérôme Bellanger, the Chief of Staff of the French Air and Space Force wrote on LinkedIn yesterday. A Rafale fighter at Prince Hassan Air Base, northwest of the Jordanian capital Amman, during the counter-ISIS operation. Photo by DAPHNE BENOIT/AFP via Getty Images DAPHNE BENOIT Bellanger continued: 'I salute our combat crews engaged in operations, who recently destroyed nearly a dozen drones, notably in the Red Sea. The quality of our weapons systems and the expertise of our crews have once again demonstrated their operational effectiveness.' Bellanger also posted a brief video from the head-up display of a French Rafale, showing the close-range interception and engagement of a Houthi drone using an air-to-air missile. (Note that in the caption for the video below, the fighter is misidentified as a Mirage 2000, but the electro-optical sensor characteristic to the Rafale is visible when illuminated by the missile’s motor). The exact total of Houthi drones that were downed by the French fighters was not disclosed and TWZ has approached the French Ministry of Defense for more details, including the dates of these incidents. The French Air and Space Force has a permanent detachment of Mirage 2000-5F fighters in Djibouti, on the Horn of Africa, from where they would be ideally positioned to intercept drones over the Red Sea. Meanwhile, Rafales have been deployed on a rotational basis at Prince Hassan Air Base in Jordan, as well as at Al Dhafra in the United Arab Emirates, both of these primarily in support of Operation Chammal, the French contribution to the anti-ISIS mission in Iraq and Syria.

Both fighters also have cannon armament, with the Mirage having a pair of 30mm DEFA weapons and the Rafale being armed with a single GIAT weapon of the same caliber. The Iranian-backed Houthis began launching drone, missile, and other attacks against foreign warships and commercial vessels in and around the Red Sea, as well as targets in Israel, in October 2023, and fighters from various nations have been prominently involved in tackling some of these threats. The fact that French fighters had been involved in shooting down Houthi drones over and around the Red Sea had been disclosed before, although the French Ministry of Defense provided very few details.

Aaron Irvin During a large-scale Houthi attack on ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden on March 9, 2024, the French Armed Forces stated that one of its warships and undisclosed French fighters shot down four combat drones that were advancing toward naval vessels belonging to the European Aspides mission in the region. A video showing the French Navy Aquitaine class frigate Lorraine during a Red Sea deployment last year: The drones presented 'an imminent threat to merchant vessels, U.S. Navy, and coalition ships in the region,' the French Ministry of Defense said in a post on social media platform X. Later the same month, the French Armed Forces released a video showing the downing of a Houthi drone over the Red Sea by a French Navy helicopter, using machine gun fire. 'On March 20, while conducting close protection under EUNAVFOR Aspides in the Red Sea, the embarked helicopter of a French destroyer shot down a Houthi UAV threatening the commercial navigation,' the official Aspides account said on X.

For a time, France was part of the international, U.S.-led task force Operation Prosperity Guardian (OPG), launched in that same month to combat the threat of Houthi missiles and drones on commercial shipping. France subsequently said it would not operate under U.S. command, amid possible strains in the relationship, as we reported previously. Since then, France has conducted its mission in the region as part of the Aspides task force. Unlike OPG, Aspides was set up as a purely defensive task force. Returning to fighters being used to counter Houthi drones, TWZ recently broke the news that U.S. Air Force F-16s have been using 70mm laser-guided rockets to down these during operations in and around the Red Sea in the past year. This involves the Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II (APKWS II) rockets, originally developed to engage targets on the ground, but now also employed as lower-cost, more numerous air-to-air weapons. So far, officials have not confirmed how many of the rockets have been used in this manner, how many Houthi drones have been shot down as a result, or when this capability was first used in combat. A pair of U.S. Air Force F-16Cs on patrol somewhere in the Middle East on January 25, 2025. The jet seen at the rear is armed with a 70mm rocket pod, as well as other weapons. U.S. Air Force The extent of the Houthis’ mass drone and missile attacks has, on occasion, seen fighters having to land to reload with missiles while threats were still flying overhead. With primary air-to-air weapons being rapidly expended, the crew of at least one U.S. Air Force F-15E was forced to switch to guns after running out of missiles but did not succeed in downing any targets. For the French Mirage 2000-5F, the combat employment against the Houthi drone threat has provided something of a proving ground for the next stage of the type’s career in Ukraine. As you can read about here, the first Mirage 2000-5Fs, taken from French stocks, arrived in Ukraine last week. The delta-winged jet is the second Western-made fighter type for Ukraine, following the arrival of the F-16, the first of which arrived in Ukraine last summer.

The Mirage 2000 can take off in a relatively short distance and has a very impressive rate of climb, as well as a top speed of Mach 1.6 even when carrying missiles and a fuel tank. With a single external fuel tank, the Mirage 2000-5F can also patrol for 1 hour and 45 minutes, provided use of the afterburner is limited. With these qualities in mind, it’s expected that the fighters will help contribute to the protection of Ukrainian cities and infrastructure against Russian drone and cruise missile attacks. In these missions, they will face Iranian-designed Shahed long-range one-way attack drones and derivatives, very similar to at least some of the drones that have been used by the Houthis. A Russian-operated Shahed drone that was brought down or crashed in Ukraine. via X Via Twitter 'The Ukrainian Air Force has new, combat-proven capabilities to carry out this air combat,' Bellanger, the Chief of Staff of the French Air and Space Force, commented, in relation to the Mirage 2000-5F transfer. While the Mirage 2000-5F continues to complement the Rafale with the French Air and Space Force and appears to have found something of a niche for itself intercepting drones in the Red Sea region, we surely won’t have to wait too long for the first reports of the venerable fighter flying combat missions with the Ukrainian Air Force, too.

The Last Mars Flying Boat Just Made Its Final Flight	The last of the Martin Mars flying boats just made its final landing, arriving in Arizona, where its eternal resting place will be the Pima Air and Space Museum (PASM). It took off earlier today from San Francisco and touched down in Lake Pleasant, Arizona. From there the iconic aircraft will be partially disessmbled and trucked to PASM for display. It will be one of more than 400 aircraft calling the 80-acre PASM museum home. Originally developed for the U.S. Navy as a maritime patrol bomber and later reconfigured as a transport ferrying supplies between Hawaii and the Pacific Islands, the Mars family of flying boats found their niche as firefighting water bombers. Philippine Mars landed in San Francisco on Sunday, making a pit stop on its way to its final destination after leaving its lakeside home in Vancouver, British Columbia. The flying boat was moored alongside the USS Hornet overnight in San Francisco Bay. The retired aircraft carrier now converted into a museum. Always a beautiful day on the USS Hornet!

(FlightRadar screencap) In 2007 Coulson Aircrane Ltd. purchased Philippine Mars and its sister aircraft, Hawaii Mars 'to expand its firefighting capabilities, establishing itself as the only operator at the time operating both fixed wing and rotary wing firefighting aircraft,' according to the company. The Martin Mars flying boats were unique aircraft. With a wingspan of 200 feet and a length of more than 117 feet, the Mars — in its ultimate configuration — tipped the scales at 165,000 pounds at its maximum takeoff weight. It was powered by four Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone radial engines, each producing 2,500 horsepower. A three-view line drawing of the Martin JRM-1 Mars, from the Bureau of Aeronautics, Navy Department, dated August 1948. (Public Domain) There were seven Martin Mars flying boats, all produced between 1942 and 1947, according to Coulson. 'The surviving fleet of four aircraft were sold in 1958 to a consortium of timber companies in British Columbia, Canada, and converted into the world’s largest waterbombers carrying 7,200 U.S. gallons per drop,' according to Vintage Aviation News. 'The Mars fleet flew cargo between Hawaii and the Pacific Islands to support the U.S. Navy during World War II,' the company explained. 'After the war, they supported the Korean War with medical air transport lifts between Hawaii and California, later transitioning to cargo lift work between Hawaii and California before being decommissioned in 1956.'

(USN) The surviving fleet of four aircraft was sold in 1958 'to a consortium of timber companies in British Columbia, Canada, and converted into the world’s largest waterbombers carrying 7,200 U.S. gallons per drop.' Coulson purchased two of the aircraft, the Hawaii Mars and the Philippine Mars, in 2007, which marked the beginning of the company’s fixed-wing air tanker operations for aerial wildfire support. The Mars water bombers 'served the Province of British Columbia from 1960-2015 and over the span of 55 years dropped over 50 million gallons each which is more water on fires than any other single firefighting aircraft in history anywhere in the world.' The aircraft were put up for sale nearly a decade ago, but nobody bought them. Eventually, they were fully retired as the cost to fly and maintain them grew. A deal was later worked out to send Philippine Mars to PASM. As we previously reported earlier this year, its sister ship, Hawaii Mars, made a two-hour flight to its new home at the B.C. Aviation Museum in Sidney on Vancouver Island. Now that Philippine Mars has arrived in Arizona, there will be no more majestic Mars flying boats to ever grace the skies again, marking the end of an aviation era.

Rare Look At S-300V1 Surface-To-Air Missile Systems In Action In ...	The Ukrainian Air Force has shared some rare views of S-300V1 surface-to-air missile systems firing their 26-foot-long 9M83 interceptors. Early in the conflict, the Soviet-era S-300V1 was one of the highest-end air defense systems available to Ukraine's armed forces, and one of the few offering critical anti-ballistic missile capability, but it's unclear how many of them are still in service. Two different clips of S-300V1s firing, as well as other footage of the system in use, were included in a video montage that Ukraine's Air Force recently released. In the Ukrainian armed forces, the Air Force is the service primarily in charge of higher-end ground-based air and missile defense. And another S-300V engagement, released as part of the same video.From what I have seen, these are the third and fourth Ukrainian S-300V engagement videos released since the start of the war. pic.twitter.com/wPHnYbCQKP&mdash; OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) February 9, 2025 Should note: first tweet includes a small error on my end, it’s a 9A85 TEL firing a 9M83 interceptor, not a 9M82. pic.twitter.com/HiMU2blgh0&mdash; OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) February 9, 2025 Despite the shared nomenclature, the S-300V series is completely different from the S-300P series variants developed by the Soviet Union and then by Russia. Versions of the S-300V include self-contained tracked transport-erector-launcher and radar (TELAR) vehicles. There are also TELs without the radar, but that also feature a crane and can be used to reload other launchers. Offboard radars can also be used with the system.

George Chernilevsky via Wikicommons (Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license) Two different interceptors exist for the S-300V series, the 9M82 and 9M83, referred to by NATO as the SA-12B Giant and SA-12A Gladiator, respectively. The 9M83 has a maximum engagement range under optimal conditions of about 47 miles. The larger 9M82, which is nearly 33 feet long and that Ukraine is now known to possess, has a reach of up to 60 miles. S-300V TELARs and TELs can, depending on subvariant, be loaded with up to two 9M82s or four 9M83s. Both interceptors have the ability to engage ballistic missiles in the terminal phase of their flight under limited circumstances. S-300V1 TELARs on parade in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv in 2018. VoidWanderer via Wikimedia (Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International license) 9M82s and 9M83s are so-called cold-launched missiles that are forcefully ejected vertically from their tubes first before their main rocket motor kicks in, making launches particularly dramatic, as can be seen in the recently released clips. As noted earlier the S-300V1 was an important air defense capability for Ukraine at the time of Russia's all-invasion in 2022. The tracked TELARs also gave the system valuable mobility that could be used to set up these powerful systems near the front lines and relatively. quickly relocate as required. However, it is not clear how many S-300V1s many may still be available. The Soviet-era systems were reportedly pulled out of storage and refurbished following Russia's illegal annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014. As TWZ has highlighted in the past, the global S-300V operator base has always been small and the only source for new production missiles has been the original manufacturer in Russia. As such, even if Ukraine still has a significant number of V1s that are still functional, stocks of interceptors for them can only have been dwindling in the past three years.

Marcus Yam / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images In fact, the video the Ukrainian Air Force recently released showing the S-300V1s in action is centered on an interview with an air defense officer, identified only as Dennis, who was originally trained on the system, but has since transitioned to the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS). Developed by defense contractors in the United States and Norway, NASAMS can fire AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles, AIM-9X Sidewinders, and IRIS-T missiles. NASAMS has been a major boon for Ukraine, and in no small part because of the many sources of missiles for it to fire, but it is not intended for use against incoming ballistic missiles.

Patriots can be and have been used by Ukrainian forces against non-ballistic targets, as well. Just in January, Israel reportedly began sending additional stocks of PAC-2 interceptors to Ukraine following its retirement of its Patriot systems last year.

Defense Industry of Ukraine Russia's ballistic missile arsenal, now bolstered by imports from North Korea, remains a serious threat to Ukraine and could grow further if much-reported deliveries of additional examples from Iran materialize. Though aging and increasingly difficult to support, any S-300V1s that remain operational in Ukraine would offer a still valuable mix of capabilities.

China’s J-20 Fighter Is Now Flying In ‘Beast Mode’	New imagery has appeared showing the Chinese J-20 stealth fighter carrying external air-to-air missiles, mirroring the so-called ‘beast mode’ that we’ve seen on U.S. fifth-generation fighters. The development comes as China looks at various ways of increasing the number of primary weapons that the J-20 can accommodate internally, while also working on various new longer-range air-to-air missiles. A video emerged recently showing a J-20 in flight, apparently fitted with eight PL-15 medium-to-long-range air-to-air missiles, carried in pairs on four underwing pylons. A screen capture from the same footage had begun to circulate late last year, although it wasn’t immediately clear if it was genuine. The appearance of the video would seem to put at rest most of those concerns. I think we have seen this image in a smaller version already in December (second image), but now an ever clearer, larger version and a video was leaked showing a J-20 in 'beast mode' carrying what appears to be 8x PL-15 (?) AAMs.(Image via @人畜无害遥感星 from Weibo) pic.twitter.com/hlwI5MCiFO&mdash; @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) February 10, 2025 Here an attempt to post a video of the video pic.twitter.com/EYB0rnB9q2&mdash; @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) February 10, 2025 It's meanwhile also well known that the J-20 has underwing hardpoints, since we have seen the fighter in the past carrying four large external fuel tanks, as you can read about here. #China #PLAAF #J20 #Stealth with four external drop tanks. via CDF/Deino,fxmdlr_ms pic.twitter.com/vTdUkyexSJ&mdash; 卫纳夜格.巴特 Col Vinayak Bhat (Retd) @Raj47 (@rajfortyseven) February 21, 2017 In fact, when we first became aware of the J-20 carrying drop tanks, we surmised that, in the future, the stealth fighter would likely also appear with weapons under their wings. In particular, we predicted that China’s very long-range air-to-air missile, now known to be designated as the PL-17, could end up arming the J-20, and that it would be carried externally. After all, the huge missile does not fit in the fighter’s weapons bay. Now, however, it seems that the ‘beast mode’ J-20 is carrying additional examples of the PL-15 — the aircraft’s standard medium-to-long-range air-to-air missile, reportedly able to hit targets at up to 124 miles. Already, the J-20 can carry four of these weapons in its main internal weapons bay. Close-up of a J-20 fighter carrying four inert examples of the original PL-15 in its main ventral bays. via Chinese Internet They can be supplemented by two short-range PL-10 air-to-air missiles. These infrared-guided weapons are deployed via novel side weapons bays, which allow the missiles to be exposed on the outside of the aircraft, with the doors closed behind them. You can read more about this fascinating aspect of the J-20’s design here. A J-20 with its short-range PL-10 air-to-air missiles deployed via the side weapons bays. via Chinese Internet Returning to the PL-15, this is an incredibly important component of China’s fast-developing airpower capabilities. In the past, the U.S. Air Force has publicly said that the emergence of the PL-15 was a key factor in the decision to start the AIM-260 program, which seeks to provide a new air-to-air missile with a range longer than that of the now-standard AIM-120 AMRAAM. The Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) defense and security think tank determines that the PL-15 'out-ranges the U.S.-made AIM-120C/D AMRAAM series and has a comparable maximum range to the Meteor.' This long range may be achieved through the use of a dual-pulse rocket motor, although this remains unconfirmed. The AIM-120D-3 is the latest variant of the combat-proven AMRAAM, developed under the Form, Fit, Function refresh, known as F3R. Raytheon An AIM-120D-3 sits at Raytheon’s Tucson, Arizona plant. The AIM-120D features the same clipped fins as the C model. (RTX) While we don’t know what — if anything — is in the internal weapons bays of the J-20 in the video, the potential for the aircraft to carry 12 PL-15s is very significant in terms of ‘magazine depth,’ although the penalty is the loss of the aircraft’s low-observable characteristics. This, however, is not necessarily a huge problem, if tactics are optimized to overcome it. In this way, it would be expected that a stealthy flight of J-20s (with all-internal missiles) would work in concert with a flight of J-20s in ‘beast mode.’ With the stealthy flight operating ahead, they would then call on the more heavily armed jets behind them as a force-multiplier, thereby overcoming their limited air-to-air missile carriage capability. In the same way, a J-20 in ‘beast mode’ could serve as something akin to an arsenal ship to support other tactical aircraft, including the forthcoming J-35 stealth fighter. China's Flanker-derivative series of fighters could also work in concert with stealthy J-20s in a similar fashion. Beyond the PL-15, China is also working on other air-to-air missiles that are likely to be added to the J-20’s armory. These include the aforementioned PL-17, a very long-range missile that may well be intended primarily to target high-value assets, like tankers and airborne early warning aircraft. You can read more about this still-mysterious missile here. As mentioned previously, this would only be available for external carriage on the J-20, although it’s unclear whether eight would be possible — four PL-17s underwing seems a much more likely maximum load-out with two being realistically more optimal for most missions. A 2016 image where the PL-17 first appeared. via Chinese Internet These two missiles are likely to be joined before long by another weapon, tentatively dubbed PL-16, the design of which seems to have been driven by the requirement for the J-20 to accommodate six longer-range missiles internally. The PL-16 will likely be superficially similar to the PL-15 but will be a compressed-carriage missile. It is expected to feature an active electronically scanned array (AESA) seeker, a Mach 5-plus fly-out speed, and significant resistance to jamming. This reflects similar trends in the United States, where, in addition to working on secretive new longer-range air-to-air missiles, there have been efforts to add more weapons to the F-22 and F-35, which are constrained by their internal weapons carriage — provided they are to retain their critical low-observability advantage. The F-35 can only carry four internal AMRAAMs, which led to a program to develop the Sidekick weapons bay adapter, which will boost the number of internal AMRAAMs a Joint Strike Fighter can carry to six. The current four-missile AIM-120 internal carriage configuration on the F-35. Crown Copyright In fact, the eight missiles that we see in the video would introduce the prospect of a J-20 that can eventually carry 14 medium/long-range air-to-air missiles, complemented by the pair of PL-10 shorter-range weapons, for a whopping 16 missiles in total. For comparison, the F-22 could theoretically carry a similar loadout, although this never happens in practice, nor is it clear if it that configuration has been tested. One of the F-15EXs biggest selling points is the ability to carry 12 AIM-120s today and possibly more tomorrow, as magazine depth becomes a greater concern in the increasingly complex domain of air-to-air combat. We still don't know whether this configuration is now operational or still in the test phase. It would seem likely, however, that we will learn more in due course and, at the same time, the development potentially opens up a much wider variety of external weapons carriage possibilities, too.

Russians Erect Mesh Net ‘Tunnel’ Over A Mile Long To Counter Ukra...	Russian troops have set up a 2km (1.24 mile) mesh netting 'tunnel' on a road linking Bakhmut and Chasiv Yar in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine. The mesh netting is designed to protect Russian logistics against first-person view (FPV) drones that have become a ubiquitous attack weapon for both sides. The move comes as Russian forces are launching another major push against the town of Chasiv Yar. 'To cover the supply routes of the Russian Armed Forces from FPV drones, military engineers are installing protective nets,' a Russian soldier said on a video showing the construction of the mesh net tunnel. 'Our group maintains more than two kilometers of anti-drone nets. The nets are placed on the most exposed sections of the roads to ensure the safe movement of our equipment. We strive to continuously expand the coverage area, enhancing the installation technology of the nets to set them up more quickly.' To protect themselves from Ukrainian drone attacks, the Russians have fenced off the road from Bakhmut to Chasiv Yar, creating a 2-km mesh tunnel. In this way, the Russians are trying to rescue their equipment and personnel from threats from drones. pic.twitter.com/qbtFvwrAcx&mdash; WarTranslated (@wartranslated) February 9, 2025 The video shows Russian troops unrolling a spool of mesh netting, which they then attached to 15- to 20-foot poles spaced evenly along both sides of the road. The theory is that the netting will provide a buffer to keep Ukrainian FPV drones from directly striking vehicles. 'The expectation is that the FPV drone, on the final trajectory of its attack, will simply get entangled with its propellers in the taut net or go off course, even if it manages to break it,' the Russian Military Informant Telegram channel wrote. Russian troops built a mesh net 'tunnel' to protect against Ukrainian FPV drones. (X screencap) You can see how Ukrainian FPV drones have affected Russian vehicle traffic in the following video. A road of death. Russia shows an area constantly targeted by Ukrainian FPV drones pic.twitter.com/2qZ2ZRui2b&mdash; Preston Stewart (@prestonstew_) February 5, 2025 The netting is the latest iteration of the ongoing efforts by each side to develop drone technology and ways to counter it. 'A year ago, the enemy created roads covered by electronic warfare posts,' Ukrainian drone expert Serhii Beskrestnovs, also known as Serhii Flash, wrote on Telegram about the mesh tunnel. 'Now drones have so many frequencies that it is not realistic to close them with electronic warfare (EW). And plus, drones with [artificial intelligence] and drones on fiber optic [cables] have appeared.' Yuri Podalyak, an influential Russian milblogger, suggested that the anti-FPV drone netting is a creation by troops in the field on an ad hoc basis because the Russian Defense Ministry is providing insufficient EW equipment. 'This is the ingenuity of the fighters against the bureaucrats of the General Staff who are still unable to understand that today electronic warfare is more important than tanks,' Podolyak wrote on Telegram. 'And even more so than a bunch of different expensive junk that was created for war and which is absolutely useless now. But which is still being mass-produced by our factories (and often ahead of schedule).' The anti-FPV drone system erected in Donetsk is not the first time Russians have tried to use netting on a grand scale to defeat these fast, highly maneuverable weapons. As we previously reported, the Russians used mesh nets strung between lamposts on a road near Bakhmut to try and break up and deter FPV drones. However, the Ukrainians quickly found a workaround, flying over the nets to strike targets behind them. That system, however, did not have side or top netting that would provide better, encapsulated protection. The following video shows how Ukrainian FPV drone operators overcame that netting. This morning there was a video with anti-drone nets hanging Wagner above the road near Bakhmut, and already in the evening a video testing their effectiveness pic.twitter.com/eGXVbfsrJ1&mdash; MilitaryNewsUA (@front_ukrainian) September 25, 2023 'Similar initiatives to hang anti-drone nets along roads in the Bakhmut direction have been observed since 2023. But such an extended single structure is encountered for the first time,' the Russian Military Informant Telegram channel noted. 'The downside is that such networks will need to be constantly updated, given the intensity with which the enemy uses its kamikazes against Russian logistics.' Another potential downside not addressed by Russian sources is how these nets would hold up against Ukrainian drone-dropped munitions. Those could take out not just the nets, but the poles supporting them, without exposing the drone to the mesh countermeasure. Even FPV drones with the ability to command detonate would also punch holes in these nets, allowing other FPVs to enter. Given the vast number of deadly FPV drones deployed, however, even an imperfect solution could prove beneficial. One noted Russian milblogger suggests that is already the case in Chasiv Yar, a town Russia has partially held since last July and is making another large push to capture the rest. 'Now, along the road, supplies are calmly flowing to the units liberating Chasiv Yar,' Oleg Tsarov posited on Telegram. The city, as the following video shows, has been devastated by the fighting. This is how the streets of Chasiv Yar in the Donetsk region look like now.Shots from fighters of the Donbas BSP of the 18th Slavic Brigade. Follow @blyskavka_ua pic.twitter.com/Cs5ZL6Rq1P&mdash; BLYSKAVKA (@blyskavka_ua) February 10, 2025 Still, creating a netted ‘tunnel’ of sorts will also confine Russian forces to a very narrow and well-defined corridor that can be bombarded by artillery and other means of attack. This could prove to be a far more ‘fatal funnel’ than what an open road plagued by FPV attacks would be. It will be interesting to see how successful this tactic ends up being. We will likely know more in the near future.

Indian Naval Collaborative Drone Concept Unveiled	Indian drone maker NewSpace Research and Technologies has officially unveiled a new jet-powered drone concept being pitched as a loyal wingman called Abhimanyu. The Indian Navy is now investing in the design as the basis for a future Naval Collaborative Combat Air Vehicle (N-CCAV), which it hopes to team with the service's existing carrier-based MiG-29K Fulcrums, Rafale-Ms expected to arrive in the coming years, and future domestically-developed fighters. A model of the current iteration of the Abhimanyu drone design is on display at the Aeroindia 2025 exhibition, which opened in the southern Indian city of Bengaluru earlier today. Angad Singh was generous enough to share pictures of the model, as well as renders the company has shared with journalists, with TWZ. Abhimanyu has been funded in part to date through the Indian Ministry of Defense's Innovations for Defence Excellence (iDEX) initiative, as well as internal company funding, according to Singh. iDEX has launched multiple rounds of Acing Development of Innovative Technologies (ADITI) innovation challenges since it was launched in 2018, including one centered on the Navy's N-CCAV needs. Indian defense outlet Livefist first reported over the weekend about Abhimanyu and the N-CCAV effort. A rendering of the Abhimanyu drone. NewSpace Research and Technologies via Angad Singh Details about the Abhimanyu drone itself are still very limited. The model at Aeroindia 2025, as well as the company renders, show a design with swept wings, horizontal stabilizers, and a single vertical tail. There are a pair of narrow air intakes for the drone's single jet engine, one on either side of the rear fuselage. Livefist says Abhimanyu was designed to have a low radar cross-section. A continuous chine-line that wraps around the fuselage is visible on the model and in the renders, which is a typical radar cross-section-reducting design feature. A main engine tucked away in the rear fuselage behind the low-profile air intakes would also help in this regard. The Abhimanyu's continuous chine-line is visible in this view of the model on display at Aeroindia 2025. Angad Singh As seen below, NewSpace's renderings also show what look to be trapezoidal-shaped main landing gear doors, another typical feature of stealth designs. No door for a nose wheel or weapons bays are readily visible. While the design clearly has features that reduce the aircraft's radar signature, it is not a low-observable design. NewSpace Research and Technologies via Angad Singh Placards that NewSpace has on display at Aeroindia 2025 along with the Abhimanyu model say the company is targeting a top speed of almost 300 knots (550 kilometers per hour), a 620-mile (1,000-kilometer) operational range, and a service ceiling of close to 19,700 feet (6,000 meters). This is relatively slow, short-range, and low-ceiling for a loyal wingman-type design, which does raise questions about the extent to which it will be able to directly operate together with faster-moving crewed combat jets. With proper planning, lower-performance drones can still enjoy teaming benefits, but with far less persistence and direct tactical cohesion with their high-performance fighter counterparts. It is worth noting that NewSpace has been working on the Abhimanyu project since at least 2023 and the current design differs completely from concepts the company has shown in the past. There has been talk previously of Abhimanyu being more of a group of designs rather than a single drone. The Indian Navy is now interested in a family of different versions of the Abhimanyu with increasingly diverse capabilities achieved through iterative development cycles, Angad Singh told TWZ. New design of NSRT Abhimanyu. Instead of external podded engines, the new design incorporates internally mounted engines with trapezoidal side intakes.@alpha_defense pic.twitter.com/a5gEMJW6cg&mdash; Frontliner (@FrontlinerUV) June 25, 2024 Abhimanyu drones with a mixture of capabilities might offer India's carrier air wings valuable added offensive and defensive capacity in cooperation with other crewed aircraft and forces down below. The pilotless planes could also help extend the sensor reach of a carrier strike group, including to provide better situational awareness and tactical flexibility. Depending on their exact capabilities, the Indian Navy might also be able to deploy N-CCAVs to locations ashore to support operations, which could also help make up for range and other limitations. NewSpace also promises a high degree of autonomy for Abhimanyu leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) technology. The company has already been testing AI/ML-driven autonomous capabilities as part of work on swarming technologies for much smaller drones. NewSpace also unveiled a new line of smaller uncrewed aerial systems with swarming capabilities, including kamikaze types, called Sheshnaag at this year's Aeroindia event. The company has done work in the past on so-called air-launched effects (ALE) type uncrewed systems in collaboration with the U.S. Air Force, as well. What unit cost NewSpace is targeting for Abhimanyu is unknown. 'Documents reviewed by Livefist suggest that NRT is developing the N-CCAV to be both cost-effective and expendable, with an emphasis on rapid production,' that outlet reported. That is certainly in line with the potential decoy role. There are some broad strokes similarities to the U.S. Navy's vision for 'consumable' carrier-capable Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones that could be expended as munitions or targets for training or testing purposes after short service lives measured in hundreds of flight hours rather than years. From what is known about it now, Abhimanyu is a notably lower-end concept compared to many other loyal wingman or CCA-like drone efforts globally, even those focused on lower costs and rapid production with capabilities balanced against those requirements. This includes the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) Warrior under development for the Indian Air Force's Combat Air Teaming System program. The twin-engine Warrior, a demonstrator or mockup thereof of which is also being shown at Aeroindia 2025, is understood to be much larger and heavier than the Abhimanyu. The demonstrator design, which HAL previously unveiled, also differs significantly from models and renders that had been shown in the past, especially the less stealthy configuration of the top-mounted air intake.

In 2021, it emerged that a subscale UCAV demonstrator, the Stealth Wing Flying Testbed, had flown at least once. China, India's top competitor, has also been very actively developing stealthy flying wing UCAVs. A number of other countries, including Russia, Turkey, and France, are doing the same. The U.S. military, at least publicly, very pointed abandoned work in this vein decades ago, as you can read more about here.

Yang Suping/VCG via Getty Images China and the United States, and now India, are among a growing number of countries with uncrewed naval aviation ambitions more specifically, efforts that also reflect the differing views on the future of uncrewed collaborative airpower. The Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) looks increasingly set to operate UCAVs from the decks of at least some of its aircraft carriers, as well as its new monster Type 076 amphibious assault ship, while the U.S. Navy remains more focused on its disposal CCA vision. For the Indian Navy, progress on the N-CCAV effort comes amid talk of scaling back its aircraft carrier plans. Indian media reported earlier this month that a proposed second domestically-produced flattop could ultimately replace the existing INS Vikramaditya, a heavily modified Soviet-era ship, rather than supplement it as had originally been expected. India has two carriers in service today, the other being the domestically-developed INS Vikrant. The Indian military, overall, does have a long history of upsets and resets on major defense procurement programs. It remains to be seen when any Abhimanyu drones actually begin to enter service regardless of what the country's carrier force might look like in the future. The current funding ceiling for Abhimanyu through iDEX is just around $2.85 million, according to Angad Singh. Much more funding is expected to be necessary to complete the design's initial development, as well as that of future variants with new capabilities. Abhimanyu has certainly now gotten another important vote of confidence from the Indian Navy. Special thanks again to Angad Singh for sharing the pictures of the Abhimanyu model and the renders, as well as information gleaned about the drone from Aeroindia 2025.

F-35 And Su-57 Face Off In India	A Russian Su-57 Felon next-generation fighter sharing tarmac with a U.S.-made F-35 stealth fighter is a truly unusual sight, and it has quickly become a signature image of the Aero India 2025 international airshow. With the Indian Air Force looking for new fighters, and with a complex path toward fielding its own fifth-generation combat aircraft, the rival jets have both been pitched, to some degree or another, toward emerging Indian requirements. However, it’s far from clear whether either of these advanced combat aircraft will be suitable, for varied reasons. The first-ever such meeting on the ground between Su-57 and F-35A (two of which were sent to the airshow) occurred at Aero India over the weekend. The airshow is taking place at Air Force Station Yelahanka in Bangalore, southwestern India, and is open to the public between February 10-14.

Photo by PJSC United Aircraft Corporation/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu Since it was first offered, the Felon has not achieved any confirmed export orders and previous plans for India to acquire it fell apart in dramatic fashion. As long ago as 2003, the Prospective Multirole Fighter (PMF) was planned as an India-specific version of the Su-57 (then still known by its T-50 prototype designation). This was intended to meet the requirements of the Indian Air Force’s Fifth-Generation Fighter Aircraft (FGFA) program. Russia and India signed a letter of intent covering the common development of the PMF, in January 2003, followed by a related inter-governmental agreement in 2007, and another contract covering the preliminary design of the aircraft in 2010.

The T-50 had made its first flight earlier the same year, on January 29. Photo by ALEXEY DRUZHININ/RIA NOVOSTI/AFP via Getty Images ALEXEY DRUZHININ The PMF would have had various new and modified systems, compared with the baseline Russian standard, including an N079 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, derived from the Russian N036. However, the project made only slow progress and was punctuated by some embarrassing incidents, including the fifth aircraft, T-50-5, catching fire on the runway at Zhukovsky, near Moscow in June 2014. This reported happened in full view of an Indian delegation. Regardless, by 2018, India had left the PMF program, as you can read about here. Nevertheless, Russia continues to push the Su-57E export version on the international marketplace. Last November, Rosoboronexport claimed that the first export contracts for the Su-57 had been signed, but, again, the buyer — or buyers — were not named. When it was first launched in 2018, Russia claimed that the Su-57E version would be 'significantly cheaper' than the F-35, although no numbers were provided. In 2019, a Su-57 was personally shown to Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan by his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, as seen in the video below, with the hope of securing Ankara’s interest in the Su-57E. Otherwise, Algeria and Egypt have been identified by analysts as possible customers, although Russia’s ostracization from much of the international community as a result of its war in Ukraine has further diminished the chances of major international arms sales. In India, meanwhile, the focus has been on the development of a homegrown fifth-generation fighter, the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA), although this is still a long way off, with the latest reports indicating it’s not planned to enter service until 2036. Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) has been officially working on the AMCA project since 2010 and, at one point, there was a stated goal of having a flying prototype by 2025. A model of the AMCA next-generation fighter. FlyingDaggers45SQUADRON/Wikimedia Commons In the meantime, the Indian Air Force faces the problem of a diminishing frontline fighter force driven by the retirement of older types, like the MiG-21 Fishbed — the Soviet-designed jet that was once the backbone of the service. This is compounded by a lack of movement on projects to buy foreign-made fighters as interim equipment, something that Angad Singh, an Indian defense journalist and contributor to this website, characterizes as 'decision paralysis.' Of course, the Indian Air Force would not have faced such problems had India’s Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Tejas program, the MiG-21’s designated successor, not suffered such lengthy delays. Currently, the Indian Air Force still has only two operational squadrons with the LCA Tejas Mk 1 and this is, in many ways a fairly limited combat aircraft — certainly when compared to fifth-generation types. Ultimately, only 40 examples are being purchased. An Indian Air Force Rafale and a Tejas Mk 1. IAF With that in mind, deliveries of the improved LCA Tejas Mk 1A are planned to start soon, allowing the Indian Air Force to finally dispose of its last MiG-21s. While more capable than the Tejas Mk 1, with more advanced radar, avionics, and weapons, the Mk 1A is still classified by the Indian Air Force as a fourth-generation type, putting it more or less on par with the South Korean FA-50, or the Saab Gripen, for example. The first series-production Tejas Mk 1A made its maiden flight from the HAL facility in Bengaluru on March 28, 2024. Hindustan Aeronautics Limited There are currently 83 Tejas Mk 1A fighters under contract, with plans to supplement this with another 97 aircraft, for a total of 180 Mk 1As. After that, 120 examples of the altogether more ambitious Tejas Mk 2 are set to be delivered to the Indian Air Force, between 2028 and 2035. Classified as 'generation 4++' fighters, these will be fitted with more powerful F414 engines and have much-improved performance as part of generally expanded capabilities. If all goes to plan, the experience with the Tejas Mk 2 should pave the way for the first of the all-new AMCA fifth-generation fighters to enter service in 2036. Currently, plans call for 120 aircraft to be procured under the AMCA program. First and only sign of the Tejas AF Mk.2&#8230;.Absolutely no talk about it anywhere or from anyone!!Strange pic.twitter.com/5xNyFnLuks&mdash; Vayu Aerospace Review (@ReviewVayu) February 10, 2025 The AMCA will feature a low-observable design, including internal weapons bays, new-generation AESA radar, and advanced avionics, and will be intended, from the outset, to operate alongside drones as part of ‘manned-unmanned’ teaming concept. Again, the AMCA is still a long way in the future and, based on prior experience, the program will likely face more delays of its own. With that in mind, and with so many different moving pieces in the Indian Air Force’s fighter puzzle, the service also launched the Multirole Fighter Aircraft (MRFA) competition. This aims to select an existing foreign-made fighter, with a total of 114 to be acquired, through a combination of off-the-shelf purchases and licensed production in India. Many might ask why India wouldn’t simply buy more Dassault Rafales, but when the 114-aircraft requirement was launched it was billed as being specifically for single-engine types, ruling out the French product. Since then, however, the competition appears to be wide open, with the F-15EX, for example, now also being offered to India, and with the Rafale and the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet also in the running. If India decides to procure another single-engine fighter, after all, the Indian-specific F-21 configuration of the F-16 is also a viable candidate.

Photo by Debajyoti Chakraborty/NurPhoto via Getty Images Debajyoti Chakraborty On the other hand, with its emphasis on a ‘non-controversial’ procurement of more ‘generation 4+’ fighters in the same class as the Rafale, the MRFA competition doesn’t appear to have a place for the Su-57, or the F-35. That brings us to the Joint Strike Fighter. In the past, there have been tentative offers of the F-35 to India, notably in 2018, when the then head of U.S. Pacific Command supposedly stated that he supported the sale of the stealth fighter to India. Just a normal day at Aero India&#8230;.10 minutes ago, it was the Su-57&#8230;and now the F-35Just how lucky are we attending this spectacle! pic.twitter.com/5CJbhS47EE&mdash; Vayu Aerospace Review (@ReviewVayu) February 10, 2025 #WATCH | Bengaluru | 054 Russian Federation Air Force Sukhoi T-50 (Su-57) and US F-35 fighter aircraft at #AeroIndia2025 For the first time, advanced fifth-generation aircraft of both Russia and the US are participating in the 15th edition of Asia's top aerospace exhibition,… pic.twitter.com/80CrEFfFMp&mdash; ANI (@ANI) February 10, 2025 The U.S. government has still not technically cleared the F-35 for offer to India, although, as in the case of the United Arab Emirates, where the same was true, this didn’t stop the previous Trump administration from pitching the aircraft to the Gulf country. It’s notable, too that, in the past Lockheed Martin hinted that India choosing its F-21 (essentially an advanced F-16, rebranded) might pave the way for the country to eventually join the F-35 program — although the company removed that claim from its official F-21 webpage shortly after it went live, as you can read about here. An artist’s impression of the F-21 that has been offered to India. Lockheed Martin For India, however, there is another potential sticking point, as Angad Singh explained to TWZ: 'Regardless of political winds in the United States, our case for the F-35 is complicated by the S-400 and the hordes of other Soviet/Russian equipment we operate.' It is worth recalling that it was the S-400 air defense system specifically that saw Turkey ejected from the F-35 program, even after the first aircraft had been built for the Turkish Air Force and with a significant industrial stake in the manufacturing effort. An S-400 air defense system during testing at Murdet Air Base near Ankara, Turkey, on November 25, 2019. Turkey purchased the weapons system from Russia over the objections of the United States, which excluded it from its F-35 program in response. Photo by Getty Images Getty Images So, while India acquiring the F-35 is by no means impossible, it would require significant negotiations, with safeguards and assurances that New Delhi might not be willing to agree to — especially if it meant giving up the S-400 or other high-end Russian-origin systems. With that in mind, could that somehow provide the Su-57 with another chance to win an Indian Air Force order? Singh is skeptical. 'The Felon, let’s be real, is probably the least-capable ‘fifth-generation’ fighter out there, and the least mature. Not a good combination. I don’t see the utility in it as a counter to Chinese fifth-generation developments.' Putting aside the respective capabilities of the Su-57 and a growing fleet of stealthy Chinese adversaries, there is also the fact that the Indian Air Force hasn’t necessarily had a good experience in the past with Russian imports — especially as regards after-sales support and maintainability. This is something that has only been exacerbated since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. 'The last thing the Indian Air Force needs is another decades-long debugging exercise like the Su-30MKI Flanker,' Singh observes.

Photo by Emmanuel DUNAND / AFP EMMANUEL DUNAND Once again, while the Indian Air Force is actively looking for new foreign-made fighters, neither the Su-57 nor the F-35 are really what the service needs and it has admitted as much in the past in terms of the aircraft that it has identified for the MRFA competition. Su57 of #Russia and F35 of #USA Sharing same airspace first time ever- Its only happened in #India. #AeroIndia Pic: @SauravChordia1 pic.twitter.com/WWTHXKsH3x&mdash; Manish Prasad (@manishindiatv) February 10, 2025 On the other hand, the Su-57 would appear to offer one clear advantage for India that the F-35 cannot compete with: the offer of local licensed production for the fighter, as HAL has done with the Su-30MKI. For India, offsets are an enormously important part of major defense acquisitions and the promise of technology transfers could also be tempting, especially as it sets to work on its own fifth-generation fighter program, the AMCA. While the appearance of the Su-57 and the F-35 together at Bangalore is certainly intriguing from the perspective of observers, it does also reinforce the urgency of the Indian Air Force’s need for new fighter equipment. With delays seemingly inbuilt for its various domestic combat aircraft programs, the need for interim fighter equipment is more obvious than ever. The Indian Air Force needs to decide on the outcome of the MRFA competition sooner rather than later. At this stage, however, the Su-57 and the F-35 both look to be outsiders.

Unprecedented New View Of BLU-109 Bunker Buster Strike That Kille...	Closed-circuit television video has emerged offering a new very up-close and personal view of the large-scale and highly-coordinated strike on Hezbollah's command bunker in Dahieh, a southern Beirut suburb and a stronghold of the militant organization, on September 27th, 2024. GBU-31/B Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) bombs with BLU-109/B bunker-busting warheads were the primary weapon used for this attack that killed Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah, as well as other top officials. It has been reported that dozens of civilians were killed and hundreds more were wounded in the attack. The decapitation strike aimed at the large bunker buried beneath a residential area was one of the key operations that sent the Iranian-backed militant group far off kilter, allowing for Israel's air and ground operations to have a far greater effect than they would have otherwise while limiting Hezbollah's ability to respond in kind. The pager and walkie-talkie sabotage operation that preceded this strike was another. Hezbollah remains heavily degraded today with the fall of the Assad regime in Syria, a key ally outside of Tehran, being another massive blow that came months later. BLU-109 with JDAM tail kits. (USAF) The video below shows what appears to be a normal day in Dahieh, with people moving about, including two motorcyclists that are shown in-frame. Then the bunker busters arrive. One is seen burrowing deep through the concrete roadway, narrowly missing one of the motorcyclists, followed by a massive subterranean explosion that 'lifts' the entire surrounding area. This is exactly the effect of a bunker buster like the BLU-109. The bomb's tough casing allows it to penetrate deep underground with its delayed fuzing detonating the warhead at a predetermined depth or even level of a reinforced compound.

Israel’s unprecedented sowing of pagers and other electronics containing small explosive charges into Hezbollah’s supply chains had already underscored its deep penetration into the group. Israel's strike is known to have involved the use of many GBU-31/Bs with BLU-109/B warheads delivered by at least eight F-15Is. Pre-strike imagery of the F-15s shows eight of them loaded to the brim with seven BLU-109/B-equipped JDAMs each, for a total of 56 bombs for the strike. Other reports put the number at over 80 bombs. ویدیویی از بلند شدن جنگنده های F-15 نیروی هوایی اسراییل مجهز به بمب GBU-31 و هسته سنگرشکن BLU-109 با وزن 2000 پوند برای حمله به مقر حسن نصرالله در بیروت روز گذشته: pic.twitter.com/Psn6BYUQ96&mdash; Awes spad (@awes_spad) September 28, 2024 IAF IAF IAF IAF It’s unclear whether or not Israel has received any BLU-116/Bs, a 2,000-pound-class penetrator featuring various improvements over the BLU-109/B, including an advanced smart fuze and the ability to punch through nearly 12 feet of reinforced concrete. The development of another 2,000-pound-class penetrator, the BLU-137/B, as a replacement for the BLU-109/B also began at least a decade ago, but to what extent that weapon is even in U.S. military service currently is not clear. Just today, the U.S. government approved the potential sale to Israel of additional JDAM kits specifically for use with the BLU-109/B, as well as precision-guided bombs and related components.

Images that emerged after the strike show giant craters and other impact areas spaced to provide continuous effects across a subterranean area. Different fuzing could have been employed to take out multiple levels of the complex and/or to ensure areas where the depth of the target wasn't known still resulted in the desired level of destruction. Layering in multiple BLU-109/Bs atop each other, allowing them to 'dig' deeper than they could if used in a singular manner, is also likely to have been used as there are reports that the bunker was located as deep as 60 feet below the surface.

Explosive-Laden Goggles Sent To Russian FPV Drone Operators	Russian officials are investigating a plot that allegedly sent explosive-laden first-person view (FPV) goggles to drone units in the hope they would detonate, killing or injuring the operator.

'The competent authorities are already working on the situation.' 'There are reports from military personnel of multiple cases of volunteers delivering mined FPV Skyzone Cobra goggles,' Razved Dozor claimed. 'The goggles contain improvised explosive devices (IED) with 10-15 grams of plastic explosive. Detonation occurs when the goggles are turned on.' Razved Dozor posted several pictures and a video claiming to show these goggles and the explosives embedded in them.

As FPV drones have played an increasingly important combat role, there have been crowd-sourced efforts by both sides to supply drones, goggles and other required equipment to front-line troops. It is unclear how many of these sabotaged goggles were sent out. Authorities intercepted several after the condition of the boxes raised suspicions. 'The boxes with the glasses themselves show weak signs of being opened,' the Russian Readovka news outlet reported on Friday. 'Only thanks to the vigilance of the military was it possible to avoid a catastrophe. Information about what happened has already been passed on to the security forces, and the perpetrator of the assassination attempt is being identified.' 'The sender is listed as a certain Roman,' Readovka noted. 'The parcels were sent via SDEK,' a large global logistics company. A box of allegedly explosive-laden FPV goggles sent to Russian troops. (Via X) Though the goggles contained only a small amount of explosives, 'the power of the explosion would have been enough to break a temple,' the popular Alex Parker Returns Telegram channel explained. 'The work was done rather sloppily, traces of opening were visible on the glasses and therefore sabotage was miraculously avoided. I am sure that this is only the beginning and further intensity of such sabotage will only increase. What a horror.' Ukrainians 'were able to repeat the trick with pagers,' Alex Parker Returns suggested in a reference to the Israeli pager and walkie-talkie attack on Hezbollah. The first wave of those explosions, on Sept. 17, 2024, targeted pagers used by Hezbollah that were triggered simultaneously. The second wave of explosions, on the following day, targeted walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah. You can read more details about how it unfolded in our reporting here. A photo taken on September 18, 2024, in Beirut's southern suburbs shows the remains of exploded pagers on display at an undisclosed location. . (Photo by AFP) While the Israeli and suspected Ukrainian plots to embed explosives in devices used by their enemies are similar, there is one big difference. The Israeli attack was far more sophisticated, with pagers and walkie-talkies triggered by a specific message command sent simultaneously to thousands of devices. It also came after years of espionage work, which included setting up front companies and an elaborate supply chain. The FPV plot just required the goggles to be powered up, meaning that if one exploded, it would likely warn other operators, reducing the number of casualties. Russian milbloggers remain concerned that this may be only the beginning of a much larger campaign. With good reason. The fact that a sabotage attempt of this nature has occurred means that any electronics that troops interface with could be at risk of similar tampering. Having to physically disassemble every device that is needed to fuel a very hot war would drastically slow down supply chains. It also causes deep psychological effects on troops who now have to wonder if any item they pickup is similarly equipped. We will have to wait and see how the Russian military reacts at scale going forward.

Chinese Tank’s Active Protection System Seen Intercepting Drone-F...	A recently emerged video shows testing of the Chinese GL-6 active protection system (APS), including against a drone-launched rocket-propelled grenade. High-angle top-down attacks are particularly threatening to tanks and other armored vehicles and can present challenges for many APSs. The footage also highlights the potential of hard-kill APSs to provide a valuable additional layer of defense against uncrewed aerial threats, including highly maneuverable first-person view (FPV) kamikaze drones, something TWZ has previously explored in an in-depth feature. The video of the GL-6 testing, seen below, first began circulating on social media yesterday after being broadcast by state-run television outlets in China. The footage shows variants of the Soviet-designed RPG-7 rocket-propelled grenade, or of the Chinese copy, the Type 69, being fired at a Type 96 tank, or at least the turret from one, fitted with the APS. The rocket-propelled grenades are seen fired from a commercial-style hexacopter drone, as well as a test fixture at ground level. One clip notably shows the GL-6 engage a top-down threat and then quickly shift to respond to one coming in laterally.

Many hard-kill APS designs on the market globally, such as the combat-proven Trophy from Israel's Rafael, use some combination of projectiles designed to destroy or at least disrupt their targets and associated sensor arrays. Israeli firms have been and continue to be particular pioneers in this space.

Chinese media reports say that the system is capable of defending against anti-tank guided missiles (ATGM), infantry anti-armor rockets, rocket-propelled grenades, and uncrewed aerial threats like loitering munitions. The GL-6 is not new, having been seen publicly displayed since at least 2022. There is evidence that it has been tested, if not fielded on several Chinese armored vehicles already. This includes the Type 99/ZTZ-99 main battle tank and a new infantry fighting vehicle capable of being air-dropped that first emerged last year, the official designation of which is not yet known. It is also being offered for export, including as an option for the VT-4A1 main battle tank. #China has modernized the Type 99 main battle tank (ZTZ-99).The tank is equipped with a new GL-6 active protection system against anti-tank missiles and high-explosive fragmentation shells.

Within this, there has also been work to expand the ability of APSs to tackle threats with specialized top-down-attack capabilities, as well as typical lateral attack profiles. A prime example of the former is the U.S. TOW 2B anti-tank missile, which has a tandem warhead that detonates downward as it passes over its target. There is also just the danger of enemy forces using high ground to launch high-angle top-down attacks, especially in dense urban environments. The tops of tanks and other armored vehicles are typically their most vulnerable points and their crews often have limited situational awareness even in open field conditions, especially if they are buttoned up inside the hull for added protection. In addition, as noted, the new GL-6 testing footage highlights the additional role defensive systems could play against similarly expanding dangers posed by uncrewed aerial systems. Drones, especially highly maneuverable maneuverable FPV kamikaze types, can be used to conduct both top-down and lower-angle attacks. Though the threat of drone attacks, including on armored vehicles specifically, is not new, something TWZ regularly highlights, the ongoing war in Ukraine has been instrumental in thrusting that reality into the public consciousness. Both Russian and Ukrainian forces now make daily use of FPV kamikaze types, as well as weaponized commercial designs capable of dropping small munitions. Various tiers of armed uncrewed aerial systems are now a common feature in hotspots globally and new advances driven by artificial intelligence and machine learning promise to make them even more deadly, as you can read more about here.

Chinese media has shown several videos in the past year or so highlighting new training for members of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) around the use of FPV kamikaze drones in particular.

Copes cages first appeared on Russian tanks in the immediate lead-up to the all-invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and have now become commonplace on both sides of that conflict. Such screens have been increasingly showing up on vehicles elsewhere around the world. Cope cage-type armor has popped up on platforms beyond ground vehicles, too.

In our feature last year, TWZ noted that there were already examples of defense contractors adding anti-drone capability to their APSs or at least looking to do so. This past October, Israel's Rafael notably announced that it had added new functionality to the Trophy systems specifically to enable it to defeat drone attacks. It is important to note that hard-kill APSs, even just against ATGMs and other infantry anti-armor threats, are not a silver bullet solution in themselves. Modern armored vehicle design is defined by continually evolving layers of defensive capabilities. The new GL-6 testing footage is the latest evidence of the general trend toward hard-kill APSs becoming not just valuable, but essential additions to tanks and other armored vehicles. This only looks set to be increasingly the case if systems like this can also demonstrate their ability to provide added protection against drones.

Germany Kicks Off Work On Leopard 3 Main Battle Tank	Germany has moved a step closer to building a new main battle tank — already dubbed Leopard 3 — with a contract issued for technical studies of 130mm ammunition, as well as a powerplant, protection systems, and other equipment. The resulting systems are expected to find their way into an interim tank that will be operated by the German military pending the arrival of an all-new Franco-German main battle tank. This more advanced tank may well also end up using some of the same equipment now being studied. The German Armed Forces procurement office, the BAAINBw, published details of the technical studies on TED, the European online procurement platform. The announcements were first reported in the media by the German defense and security website hartpunkt. These reveal that technical studies have been commissioned to cover three different areas: firepower, mobility, and protection. So it seems Germany might be developing a Leopard 3 tank. Recent contracts announced by the BAAINBw point to the following developments: - Ammunition for the @RheinmetallAG 130 mm gun- New engine from @Liebherr - Improved protection from @hensoldt - And improvements to the… pic.twitter.com/a87dE9mtpz&mdash; Sam Cranny-Evans (@Sam_Cranny) February 6, 2025 All of these new technologies are intended to be compatible with the existing Leopard 2 main battle tank. However, should they eventually be integrated into a single platform, the result will be a significantly different tank. This will likely be designated Leopard 3 — although it has also been described as the Leopard 2 AX or 'the bridge solution.' The study for 130mm ammunition will be conducted by Rheinmetall. This reflects a broader interest in moving to increased-caliber tank armament and the gun itself is something that Rheinmetall has been working on for some time now. A size comparison of Rheinmetall’s original 120mm gun, its extended L55 variant, and an earlier, proposed 140mm type. The new 130mm design is shorter than the 120mm L55. Rheinmetall This work is broken down into three components, for three different ammunition types: the DM13 rounds that will be used as qualification ammunition for trials; DM11 multifunctional high-explosive ammunition; and DM23 kinetic-energy anti-armor ammunition. It was previously known that a large-caliber 130mm main gun was being planned for the Main Ground Combat System (MGCS) a Franco-German project that seeks to field an advanced new main battle tank as well as a ‘system of systems’ of other crewed and uncrewed vehicles. The tank component is expected to ultimately replace Germany’s existing Leopard 2s, as well as France’s Leclercs. Rheinmetall’s 130mm gun has also been around for some time. The smoothbore gun, with 52 caliber lengths, was first revealed in prototype form in 2016. At the time, Rheinmetall said that the new gun would offer a 50 percent increase in kinetic energy compared with the 120mm gun used on the Leopard 2. While this is significant, in terms of penetration power, the larger gun is also notably heavier and bulkier than the 120mm weapon. When it was unveiled, Rheinmetall said the 130mm gun weighed more than 7,700 pounds, compared with around 6,600 pounds for the 120mm gun. At the same time, the larger projectiles fired — each of which weighs more than 66 pounds and is around 4.2 feet long — require an automatic loader within a turret of revised design. Rheinmetall’s 130mm tank gun. Note the difference in the size of the ammunition, at left, compared to a standard 120mm round. Rheinmetall Rheinmetall has already carried out firing demonstrations with the 130mm gun, as well as extensive simulations and studies. Meanwhile, Liebherr will be responsible for the study for a new engine, known as OLYMP. Like the 130mm main gun, this will be tailored for the ‘interim’ Leopard 3, but it could potentially have other applications too. In the past, Liebherr has developed and produced engines for the Marder 1 infantry fighting vehicle as well as its successor, the Lynx KF41. The BAAINBw description specifies a complete engine block, comprising the combustion engine itself as well as steering, manual gearbox, cooling system, combustion air filtration, and exhaust system. Also required are engine mounts to attach the power pack to the chassis, side gears, and connections to the control system and fuel supply. The study calls for the use of as many existing components from the Leopard 2 as possible. Hensoldt and KNDS Deutschland are the two companies commissioned to study the increased level of protection for the Leopard 3. This calls for the development of a 'significantly more combat-capable variant of the MUSS,' a reference to Hensoldt’s existing Multifunctional Self-Protection System. This may result in a further enhancement of the MUSS 2.0 the company presented last year, for use on the Puma infantry fighting vehicle and other platforms. The MUSS 2.0 installed on a Puma infantry fighting vehicle. Hensoldt The current MUSS 2.0 is a lighter-weight and lower-profile system than the original MUSS. It essentially consists of four passive sensors located around the vehicle. Each of these sensors combined a missile and laser warning sensor, as well as a laser-based infrared jammer and an infrared countermeasures dispenser. The system is designed to defend against anti-tank guided missiles, but it can also detect tracer rounds, muzzle flashes, projectile fire, and low-power lasers. The MUSS 2.0 is able to detect different threats simultaneously, prioritize them, and then counter them, in semi- or fully autonomous modes. The threat database can also be regularly updated, to deal with new and emerging threats. Finally, two further technical studies have been awarded to Hensoldt and to KNDS Germany, calling for work in a field adjustment system. This is required to compensate for the effects of barrel bend, a phenomenon that is caused by changes in temperature and which can affect the accuracy of the main gun. In the Leopard 2, a manual system is used for field adjustment, which is the responsibility of the gunner. The BAAINBw wants a new system to be fully automated so that regular manual adjustment is no longer necessary. The interim main battle tank, if development continues, will provide the German Armed Forces with a tank that will serve at least until the introduction of an all-new fighting vehicle, being developed under the MGCS project. The report from hartpunkt, which cites unnamed defense insiders, suggests that the interim Leopard 3 (provided it receives this designation) will be 'adapted to the current threat level in terms of performance and will have additional capabilities compared to the Leopard 2A8.' The latter is currently the most advanced production version of the Leopard 2. The report adds that the interim tank should start to enter service in the 2030s — if the German government gives it the go-ahead. The tank should then serve for around 25 years. A Leopard 2A8 tank. KNDS At this stage, the final specifications of the Leopard 3 are still to be determined, and they will likely be refined after these three technical studies are completed. The German Armed Forces procurement office expects this work to be finished by the end of 2026. It’s unclear where the new technical studies will leave the Leopard 2 A-RC 3.0 version of the Leopard 2, which was rolled out by Franco-German defense conglomerate KNDS last summer, as you can read about here. This new version of the Leopard 2 features a completely uncrewed turret that can be armed with an even larger 140mm main gun. The tank also features a built-in anti-tank guided missile launcher and a remote weapon station armed with a 30mm cannon optimized for engaging drones, a threat that has now fully emerged thanks to the war in Ukraine. The Leopard 2 A-RC 3.0. The pop-up missile launcher is visible on top of the turret. KNDS KNDS wants to offer the Leopard 2 A-RC 3.0 for sale but also expects it to be a key stepping stone to the next-generation MGCS. Last year, KNDS announced it would establish a new joint company with Germany’s Rheinmetall and Thales in France specifically to work on MGCS. As for Rheinmetall, this company also unveiled its own next-generation tank, the KF51 Panther, back in 2022. The KF51 also has a 130mm main gun — as specified for the new interim tank — in a more traditional crewed turret. That turret also features a built-in launcher for missiles or drones and the option to install a remote weapon station on top. You can read more about the Panther’s design and capabilities here. An artist’s concept of the KF51 Panther. Rheinmetall It had previously seemed likely that the Leopard 2 A-RC 3.0 would find itself in direct competition with the KF51 and, while that may be the case for sales outside Germany, the latest technical studies suggest that the BAAINBw is eyeing a different solution. While this will be broadly based on the Leopard 2, it will be a more ambitious project than the Leopard 2 A-RC 3.0, which does not — as far as is known — include a new powerplant. Regardless, it’s notable that Germany is once again very active in tank development, something that reflects wider trends. After years during which many tank operators either reduced their fleets or removed them altogether, armored warfare is now experiencing something of a renaissance, spurred, in no small part, by the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. While France and Germany remain committed to the MGCS, the German Armed Forces clearly see a requirement for a main battle tank that can be introduced to service before this next-generation fighting vehicle becomes available. In the meantime, these German studies for an interim main battle tank — whatever it might be called — look like they could also provide a pointer to what the future MGCS tank could look like.
