Israel’s Reprisal Strike Carefully Calculated, Unclear If Jets Ev...	Israel's retaliation strike on Iran targeted air defense positions and long-range weapons facilities. Carried out primarily by the Israeli Air Force, it was a limited attack meant to weaken Tehran's offensive and defensive capabilities and to highlight Israel's deep strike capabilities. The strikes on air defense sites, in particular, made Iran more vulnerable to a larger follow-up strike, a clear deterrent against further escalation. By sticking to strictly military targets with few reported casualties, the operation also fell within the guidelines suggested by the Biden administration, and the threshold Iranian officials had previously suggested would result in no further kinetic actions. The strikes were in retaliation for the massive Oct. 1 Iranian ballistic missile barrage on Israel. Some 20 targets were hit, 'including the S-300 air defense of Imam Khomeini International Airport which provides defense cover for parts of the sprawling capital,' The New York Times reported, citing two Iranian officials, including a member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp (IRGC). 'In Tehran Province, at least three Revolutionary Guards missile bases were attacked, the officials said,' according to The Times. 'In a second round of Israeli strikes, the officials said, Israeli drones targeted the secretive Parchin military base in the outskirts of Tehran and one drone hit the base while others were shot down, they added.' It is unclear exactly what drones would have been used or if the weapon type stated is indeed accurate. U.S. and Israeli officials 'reported that three waves of airstrikes took place on Saturday morning local time, later named Operation Days of Repentance, the Jerusalem Post reported. 'The first wave targeted Iran’s air defense system, while the second and third focused on missile and drone bases and weapons production sites.' Satellite images emerged on social media purporting to show damage to a facility in Khojir as well as Iran's new solid-propellant rocket motor plant in Parchin, about 950 miles east of Israel. The plant was opened in 2021, according to Fabian Hinz, a Research Fellow Defense and Military Analysis at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. It is reportedly associated with the production of fuel for Scud, Fateh 110, and Zelzal ballistic missiles, we previously reported. In October 2014, there was a massive explosion at Parchin, which many believed was the result of sabotage by Israeli or American intelligence services.

Video and images emerged on social media purported to show a spent booster from an Israeli air-launched ballistic missile that was found in Iraq. The last and only time Israel struck Iran directly using traditional airpower came last Spring after Iran sent a barrage of drones and missiles at Israel. Following that Israeli response, it became clear an air-launched ballistic missiles were used to do so. A booster for one of these weapons, which Israel has an impressive and growing portfolio of, was found in a field in Iraq close to the Iran-Iraq border. TWZ did a breakdown on exactly what was found and its implications you can read here. Yesterday we posited that more of these would show up in this area today. These weapons, which include Rocks and Air LORA, allow the IAF to strike deep into another country from great standoff distances and do so with a weapon that hits very hard with high-accuracy and is extremely challenging to intercept. Another Missile Booster was found in Samarra city, western Salah Alden. #Iraq pic.twitter.com/QETVOGmDKo&mdash; Tammuz Intel (@Tammuz_Intel) October 26, 2024 Missile booster was found in Salah Alden Governorate, northern #Iraq, that was used in last night's attack on Tehran. #Iran pic.twitter.com/T1LzB7yuOY&mdash; Tammuz Intel (@Tammuz_Intel) October 26, 2024 Lots of spent air launched ballistic missile boosters near the Iran-Iraq border will likely show up on social media tomorrow.&mdash; Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) October 26, 2024 The question still remains if any IAF crewed assets ever even entered into Iranian airspace. Standoff munitions, especially air-launched ballistic missiles, could have been responsible for striking the limited target sets that were hit. This would have several critical advantages. First, doing so would result in a far less complex, lower-risk operation that could be executed and finished in a number of hours not days, with much fewer assets needed over a much shorter timeframe. It would also not necessitate the U.S. being directly involved in the operation, especially in a support role, such as providing aerial refueling. Second, the risk of losing a crew and having to attempt a rescue would also be far less of an issue as it would be only limited to Syria and Iraq, where Israel already operates and has long-standing contingency plans for. While Jordan and Saudi Arabia, if their airspace was used, have better diplomatic ties with Israel to deal with such an occurrence, and still CSAR could be able to cover those areas as well. The distance and hostility related to Iran makes doing so a much more risky and complex affair. Third, using standoff weapons, once again especially ALBMs, the suppression/destruction of enemy air defenses campaign could also be drastically reduced, if needed really at all. Many special capabilities, such as electronic warfare and cyber attacks, could be withheld for future contingencies. It's still possible that unmanned platforms were used even if manned ones were not, potentially including clandestine ones with penetrating capabilities. These are just some key points, there are others including adhering to U.S. demands as far as the mission's scope and risk for rapid escalation. The IDF released images and video showing F-15 and F-16 fighters that took part in the attack. One of those F-15 Bazs, marked 957 'Sky Blazer,' has an interesting history. 'It was involved in a mid-air collision with an A-4 during a training exercise over the Negev in 1983, according to Times of Israel reporter Emanuel Fabian. 'The F-15 managed to land safely and was later repaired.' Over the years, 'Sky Blazer has downed 4.5 Syrian planes (half because another F-15 was involved in shooting down a Syrian MiG-23 in 1985, and it was unclear which one launched the missile that ultimately caused the plane to be shot down),' he added. 'The same F-15 also participated in September's strikes on the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen.' Fun fact about the F-15 marked 957 'Sky Blazer' seen in this video.

They are heavily laden with fuel, with the F-15 packing three tanks and the F-16 packing three as well, including two 600-gallon wing tanks — the largest any F-16 can carry — as well as the F-16Is standard conformal fuel tanks. The question of if and how Tehran will respond looms large over the region. 'It is too soon to say,' an administration official told The War Zone Saturday. On Saturday, U.S. President Joe Biden 'convened a call with Vice President Kamala Harris and their national security team to receive a briefing and discuss the latest developments in the Middle East following Israel’s precise response to Iran’s ballistic missile attack on October 1st,' according to the White House press pool. 'President Biden directed that every effort be taken to protect our forces and help defend Israel against any potential responses from Iran and its proxies.' 'I was on with the intelligence community for the last half hour,' Biden said. 'It looks like they didn’t hit anything other than military targets. I hope that this is the end.' Iranian authorities 'strongly condemned' the attack, saying they reserved the right to respond. However, they downplayed the results, a possible indication that they may not. Iran’s Foreign Ministry on Saturday decried yesterday’s attack against military targets 'as a clear violation of the international law, the UN Charter, and the article on the prohibition of threat or use of force against the territorial integrity and sovereignty of states, according to the official Tasnim news agency. 'On the basis of its inherent right to legitimate defense, stipulated in Article 51 of the UN Charter, the Islamic Republic of Iran considers itself to be rightful and duty bound to defend against the foreign acts of aggression.' Iran Entitled to Defense against Aggression: Foreign Ministry pic.twitter.com/0YTWYw24dE&mdash; Tasnim News Agency (@Tasnimnews_EN) October 26, 2024 As we noted yesterday, however, Iranian leaders had said before the attack that if it was limited to military facilities they might take the hit, not strike back and at least for now end the tit-for-tat barrages that have flown into both nations. To that end, it Israeli officials contacted Iran before the attack and said what they would and would not hit, according to the Jerusalem Post. Israel warned Iran ahead of Operation Days of Repentance, saying which targets would and won't be struck and warning Tehran not to respond.Full story > > The Jerusalem Post (@Jerusalem_Post) October 26, 2024 Still, they have to walk a fine line between their actions and appeasing that segment of the population calling for war with Israel. 'You played with the lion's tail,' warned Hesamoddin Ashena, adviser to former Iranian president Hassan Rouhani. '&#8230; This is Iran.' In what may be an indication of the government’s intentions, Iranian state media messaging dismissed the Israeli attack. They said it caused little damage and no upheaval to civilian life. Officials said air defenses downed most of the incoming missiles, no oil refineries or nuclear facilities were hit, and that casualties were limited to four soldiers who were killed. Outlets like Tasnim and IRNA portrayed a return to calm in Iran, with markets bustling, streets filled with traffic, and aircraft arriving and departing from Imam Airport in Tehran. 'Life normal across Iran after air defense thwarts Israeli aggression,' the official Iranian Fars news agency wrote. 'Tehran's Grand Bazaar bustles with activity on Saturday.'

B-21 Taking On Some Of NGAD Fighter’s Missions On The Table Air F...	The U.S. Air Force has not ruled out expanding the roles and missions of the B-21 Raider stealth bomber as part of its ongoing reassessment of plans for a new crewed sixth-generation stealth 'fighter.' This is not the first time the service has at least alluded to the possibility of an air-to-air combat role for the Raider. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin talked about the B-21 and the future of the sixth-generation combat jet that has been under development as part of his service's Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative earlier today at the 2024 Military Reporters & Editors (MRE) Conference. The plans for the NGAD aircraft, also sometimes referred to as the Penetrating Counter-Air (PCA) platform, are currently undergoing a deep review. Concerns about very high expected costs – individual fighter-like NGAD aircraft potentially costing $300 million or more apiece – have been cited as the central driver behind the reassessment. The first pre-production B-21 Raider. USAF The first pre-production B-21 Raider at Plant 42 ahead of its first flight. USAF 'We intend to have that by December,' Allvin said when asked about the timeline for when the NGAD combat jet review is expected to be finished. 'We also want to be able to influence the&#8230; [proposed] budget submission in February. So, obviously, all that has to go through DOD [the Department of Defense]. So we're looking to have the results in December.' 'As the NGAD review goes forward, like, is it possible that what that ends up with could be the B-21 taking a larger role?' Defense News' Stephen Losey asked Allvin later in his talk. 'We have not taken that off the table,' the Air Force's top officer said in response. Allvin did not elaborate on what this might mean for the B-21, but as already noted, this is not the first time the possibility of an 'air dominance' role for the Raider has come up. 'If we were to characterize it [NGAD] as a fighter, we would be… thinking too narrowly about what kind of airplane we need in a highly contested environment,' then-Air Force Maj. Gen. Scott Pleus, told what was then Air Force Magazine back in 2019. 'A B-21 that also has air-to-air capabilities' and can 'work with the family of systems to defend itself, utilizing stealth – maybe that’s where the sixth-generation airplane comes from.' At the time, Pleus was Director of Air and Cyber Operations for Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), the Air Force's top command in that region. Now a lieutenant general, he is currently Director of Staff at the Air Force's Headquarters at the Pentagon. It remains unclear whether Pleus' 2019 comments explicitly reflected an idea for employing the B-21 in air-to-air combat, or if he was referring to a similarly sized and/or otherwise capable aircraft. Renderings of very stealthy tailless designs, like the one below from Lockheed Martin, have historically been used to illustrate discussions about the NGAD combat jet. Lockheed Martin At the same time, as The War Zone has explored in detail in the past, the B-21's size, long range, high-altitude ceiling, broadband low-observability (stealthiness), and other capabilities could actually make it well suited to supporting certain forms of air-to-air combat. The Raider has the potential to serve as a launch platform for air-to-air missiles, especially outsized very long-range types. Its payload capacity would give it the ability to carry a large volume of smaller air-to-air missiles, as well. B-21s could also employ air-to-ground munitions in support of the suppression and destruction of enemy air defenses mission (SEAD/DEAD), which is also part of the air superiority equation. Maybe most significantly, the B-21s could also act as airborne nerve centers in support of counter-air missions, especially for controlling drones like the Air Force's planned fleets of Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA), and have the ability to do so even in the most heavily contested of airspaces. Uncrewed aircraft, in turn, could feed targeting data back to Raiders with air-to-air loadouts. B-21s might even be able to launch some of those drones themselves. The video below from Collins Aerospace offers a good visual depiction of how CCA-type drones might work together with crewed aircraft in an air-to-air combat scenario, including by extending the sensor reach of the entire force. 'What is the role, if any, of a CAA in consonance with the B-21 as it’s fielded?' then-Air Force Lt. Gen. James Slife, at the time Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, asked rhetorically at the annual Defense News Conference last year. 'We should we should keep our options open for how we employ them going forward.' Gen. Slife is now Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force. Labeling the B-21 as simply a bomber is already something of a misnomer. 'The B-21 is multi-functional,' Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said at the roll-out ceremony for the first pre-production Raider in December 2022. 'It can handle anything from gathering intel to battle management.' The first pre-production B-21 in flight. USAF How any increased role for the B-21 might impact broader plans for the Raider is unclear. Allvin took the time today to push back on comments this week from Kathy Warden, CEO of Northrop Grumman, the prime contractor for the B-21, about possible changes on the horizon to the planned Raider force structure. The Air Force's publicly stated plan remains to buy 100 of these aircraft. 'I can see that being something in the future [that changes]. &#8230;we do not currently have a plan to do that in the next month or two,' Allvin said. 'I think we'll understand more about it [as testing proceeds] that will give us more confidence [about fleet size].' 'But there's also going forward to understand the capability, the capabilities that are bearing out, along with the price point,' the Air Force Chief of Staff continued. 'So far, the program has been run very well, and so the usual price ballooning we haven't seen.' 'We do not have that on the front burner right now to re-evaluate' the planned B-21 fleet size, he added. In April, Allvin had also told members of Congress that 100 B-21s was still the plan, as well as that his service was already looking ahead to augment the Raiders with new capabilities. Photo courtesy of Jonathan Case, Northrop Grumman It is important to stress that the reassessment of the NGAD combat jet plans is ongoing and we know it is intended to be exhaustive. Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall has talked repeatedly now about how the service is also considering a significantly cheaper (and similarly less capable in certain regards) crewed stealth aircraft focused primarily on the drone controller mission as another alternative. You can read more about what that plane could look like here. With the Air Force hoping to have the completed review of its NGAD 'fighter' plans in hand before the end of the year, it might not be too long before more details about its conclusions, and how they may or may not relate to the B-21, start trickling out.

NATO Flexes With Simultaneous Nuclear Strike And Naval Warfare Ex...	Steadfast Noon, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s annual tactical nuclear weapons exercise in Europe, was completed yesterday, having been run simultaneously with the British-led Strike Warrior large-scale maritime maneuvers, centered around a British Carrier Strike Group. The combined drills sent a powerful message to Russia, not just in terms of NATO’s enduring nuclear strike potential in Europe but also in regards to its diverse conventional military capabilities spread across the continent. This year’s Exercise Steadfast Noon began on October 14 and ended on October 24. In a statement, the alliance confirmed that 'more than 60' aircraft took part, as well as around 2,000 military personnel from eight air bases. #steadfastnoon24 is a two week EX conducted in the area of Western Europe. The main purpose is to train the Allies in Nuclear deterrence. For the first time, the F35-A is showing her abilities. #strongertogether @NATO pic.twitter.com/gkPIf16NPw&mdash; NATO JFC Naples (@JFC_Naples) October 23, 2024 Steadfast Noon is concerned entirely with nuclear deterrence and involves training flights over Western Europe each fall. The aircraft that take part are nuclear-capable but there are no live warheads used in the exercise. In the past, we have explored exactly what procedures are likely practiced in Steadfast Noon and how these drills are a cornerstone for ensuring readiness to launch a nuclear attack during a crisis. Under the NATO nuclear-sharing arrangement, U.S. B61 nuclear gravity bombs are understood to be housed in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Turkey, and can be employed by tactical jet aircraft from approved member states. Turkey notably hosts B61s, but is not among the countries that could employ them. Non-strategic NATO combat jets currently capable of carrying nuclear weapons include the F-15E, F-35A, F-16, and Tornado. They are referred to as Dual-Capable Aircraft (DCAs) in NATO parlance, and you can read more about them here. A frontal view of four B61 nuclear gravity bombs on a bomb cart. Defense Department photo by SSGT PHIL SCHMITTEN 'Nuclear deterrence is the cornerstone of allied security,' NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said, ahead of this year’s exercise. 'Steadfast Noon is an important test of the Alliance’s nuclear deterrent and sends a clear message to any adversary that NATO will protect and defend all allies.' The host countries for this year’s Steadfast Noon were Belgium and the Netherlands (Kleine Brogel and Volkel air bases, respectively), with most training flights taking place over these nations, as well as over Denmark, the United Kingdom, and the North Sea.

A notable feature of this year’s nuclear exercise was the involvement of Royal Netherlands Air Force F-35As, for the first time since these were declared ready to perform nuclear roles, with the B61-12 thermonuclear bomb. You can read more about this development here. An F-35A drops an inert B61-12 bomb during a certification test flight. U.S. Air Force B-52s have been involved in Steadfast Noon before. Although Steadfast Noon is a tactical nuclear exercise and the Stratofortress is a strategic platform, the exercise also involves a range of aircraft working in packages to get the Dual-Capable Aircraft into the target area. Such scenarios could include B-52s delivering conventional weapons. For some time now, the only nuclear weapons available to the B-52 are cruise missiles – currently AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missiles (ALCMs) that are set to be eventually replaced by new AGM-181 Long Range Stand-Off (LRSO) types. Supporting these nuclear strike platforms were various fighter escorts, aerial refueling tankers, airborne early warning, and electronic warfare aircraft.

According to reports ahead of Steadfast Noon, other countries involved comprised the Czech Republic (with Gripen multirole fighters), Denmark (F-16), Finland (F/A-18), Greece (F-16), Poland (F-16), Romania (F-16), Turkey (F-16), and the United Kingdom (F-35B and Typhoon). Meanwhile, non-nuclear-capable Eurofighter EF2000s from both Germany and Italy were also listed as participants.

The country applied to join the alliance in May 2022, along with Sweden, in response to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Poland, meanwhile, is not currently a member of NATO’s nuclear weapon-sharing program but has expressed an interest in at least hosting weapons in the past. This policy position has been underscored by concerns over Russia’s decision last year to forward-deploy nuclear weapons in Belarus in cooperation with that country’s military. Russia really wants West to see they're doing a tac nuke exercise.

In particular, the think tank notes that there has been significant recent modernization of infrastructure at nuclear-tasked air bases in Europe. 'This modernization involves security upgrades to the underground vaults that store the U.S. nuclear weapons, underground cables and nuclear command and control systems, and facilities needed for the new F-35A nuclear-capable fighter-bomber,' FAS states in its related report.

Public Domain/WikiCommons Modernization has included special loading pads at Kleine Brogel in Belgium, Ghedi in Italy, and Volkel in the Netherlands to receive U.S. Air Force C-17 airlifters that transport nuclear weapons and service equipment. Kleine Brogel has also received major upgrades to its weapons maintenance facilities, where nuclear weapons are stored and worked on. At Volkel, FAS has identified the construction of a new wall in front of an aircraft parking area, to keep this hidden from spotters and other observers outside the base. NATO's annual tactical nuclear weapons exercise Steadfast Noon begins today. Here is a backgrounder including what is happening at the different nuclear bases: pic.twitter.com/4aAX7SvDEu&mdash; Hans Kristensen (@nukestrat) October 14, 2024 In Germany, Büchel air base is midway through an upgrade that is adding, among others, a service area for Germany’s future nuclear-capable F-35As and a refurbished runway. There is also evidence here of security upgrades for the nuclear weapons area and a possible loading pad for C-17s. One other NATO air base in particular has come under extensive scrutiny in recent months. This is RAF Lakenheath in England, used by the U.S. Air Force, where the nuclear mission is expected to return after a long absence. The base is home to the 48th Fighter Wing, part of U.S. Air Forces in Europe, which includes squadrons of nuclear-capable F-15Es and F-35As. One of the first F-35As for the 48th Fighter Wing (specifically, the constituent 495th Fighter Squadron) touches down at RAF Lakenheath in December 2021. U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Koby I. Saunders However, there is still a degree of mystery around the nature of the nuclear mission at the U.K. base. Since 2022, Lakenheath has been listed as one of the NATO bases undergoing nuclear upgrades. The Pentagon has remained tight-lipped about this, but construction work on new aircraft shelters and underground vaults to store nuclear weapons has been confirmed by satellite images. Whether nuclear weapons will be permanently stored at Lakenheath is unclear and it remains possible that the facilities here are intended as a backup for the other air bases in Europe with a NATO nuclear mission. The total number of aircraft in Steadfast Noon appears to have been a modest increase over the number of aircraft involved in last year’s drill ('up to 60') but more significant is the fact that NATO air forces in Europe were simultaneously engaged in Exercise Strike Warrior. The U.K.-run Strike Warrior maneuvers took place primarily off the coast of Scotland over the same timeframe and had the main role of confirming that the U.K. Royal Navy’s Carrier Strike Group, centered around the aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales, is ready for operations.

As well as British assets, Strike Warrior involved other NATO participants, and most of the nations participating in the British-led exercise also took part in Steadfast Noon.

Russia’s Iskander-M short-range ballistic missile can carry a nuclear or a conventional warhead and is among the country’s available tactical nuclear weapons. Vitaly Kuzmin via Wikimedia The rhetoric from Moscow has included repeated threats by President Vladimir Putin to use nuclear weapons, as he seeks to thwart NATO support for Ukraine and, especially, to try and ensure that limits remain on Ukraine’s use of Western-supplied long-range weapons to strike targets within Russia’s recognized borders. Moscow has also held its own high-profile tactical nuclear exercises. These drills have been accompanied by the announcement of possible changes to Russia’s nuclear doctrine. These have included the suggestion that the Kremlin’s threshold for the potential use of nuclear weapons may have been lowered, although the exact permutations of this — and whether it really constitutes a significant change — have been subject to some debate. NATO has always reiterated that the Steadfast Noon isn’t targeted toward any nation, in particular. A NATO video published yesterday described a 'fictitious red adversary,' although the identity of the alliance’s primary nuclear foe has always been clear. #SteadfastNoon24 showcases NATO's nuclear deterrence in today’s world.

Our First Look At The Ghost Shark Uncrewed Submarine Underwater	We have now gotten our first look at the Ghost Shark extra-large autonomous undersea vehicle (XL-AUV) operating submerged thanks to the Autonomous Warrior 2024 maritime autonomous capabilities demonstration in Australia. The Royal Australian Navy (RAN) is the first known customer for the highly modular Ghost Shark, which manufacturer Anduril is now pitching elsewhere, including to the U.S. Navy. The Australian Department of Defense released a video montage, seen below, from Autonomous Warrior 2024 that includes clips of Ghost Shark below the waves this week. The event took place predominantly in and around Jervis Bay on Australia's eastern coast over a period of three weeks earlier this month. There are two separate clips of the Ghost Shark in the Autonomous Warrior 2024 video, captures from which are seen at the top of this story and below. In both cases, the top of the mast at the front of the drone submarine appears to be blurred out. Australian Department of Defense capture Ghost Shark's mast, which is distinctly lower profile than what is typically found on other uncrewed underwater vehicles (UUV), is a particularly notable feature of the design. Otherwise, what can be seen in the Autonomous Warrior 2024 video looks to be in line with imagery of the drone submarine that has been released since it first broke cover in April. 'We don’t have big masts running down the backbone of our vehicle that a lot of other designs do that then preclude the ability for the payloads to come out in different directions… of the payload module itself,' Dr. Shane Arnott, Senior Vice President for Engineering at Anduril and the company’s maritime lead, told The War Zone in an interview back in August. 'So we have… in effect, unlimited flexibility in this design, just the way that we’ve configured the vehicle and the payload bay itself could be almost anything within a size configuration that you can dream up. We haven’t encountered crazy idea yet from a customer that … we can’t fit.' Australian Defense Force Australian authorities have said they expect to use their future fleet of Ghost Sharks for 'persistent intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance [ISR] and strike,' but have provided no additional details so far about how the drone submarines might be configured to perform those missions. Anduril has also declined to provide more specific information about the UUV's capabilities, including its maximum range and endurance. You can read more about what is known about the design to date here. Regardless, events like Autonomous Warrior 2024 offer important opportunities for the RAN and Anduril to further test and refine Ghost Shark capabilities, as well as explore how they can be alongside other crewed and uncrewed platforms. Anduril announced earlier this year that it had brought a Ghost Shark to the United States for the first time as part of efforts to expand its capacity to test the UUV, as well as demonstrate it to prospective customers. 'There’s just a lot of test points for us to hit. So, having the ability to have multiple Ghost Sharks, and particularly in different waters around the world, such that we can burn down those test points and just grow our trust and the customer’s trust by testing and ‘show me, don’t tell me,’ is kind of a really big part of why we’ve done this [bringing the UUV to the United States,' Anduril's Arnott explained to us earlier this year. A Ghost Shark drone submarine being lowered into the water during previous testing. Australian Defense Force Ghost Shark was not the only uncrewed platform involved in Autonomous Warrior 2024, which is part of a larger Australian maritime autonomy initiative called Maritime Big Play (MBP) and is also tied in with the 'advanced capabilities' Pillar II of the trilateral Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS) defense cooperation agreement. Pillar I of the AUKUS agreement centers on the RAN's acquisition and fielding of a nuclear-powered submarine force and assisting with that effort. Maritime Big Play also has links to the U.S. military's Technology Readiness Experimentation (T-REX) effort and NATO's Robotic Experimentation and Prototyping Augmented by Maritime Unmanned Systems (REPMUS) exercise series, according to the Pentagon. The U.S. Navy has also been conducting a growing number of large-scale uncrewed-focused maritime exercises and demonstration events in recent years. Also seen in the Australian Department of Defense video are Greenough Advanced Rescue Craft (GARC), Swiftships Sea-Stalker, and Ocius Bluebottle uncrewed surface vessels, as well as a REMUS-series UUV. Ocean Aero's Triton hybrid UUV/USV and at least one other larger UUV design are visible at points in the montage, too, as are various uncrewed aerial systems and high-altitude balloons. GARC (at left) and Sea-Stalker USVs in use at Autonomous Warrior 2024. Australian Department of Defense capture A trio of Ocius Bluebottle USVs sail together during Autonomous Warrior 2024.

Australian Department of Defense capture There are two clips showing the apparent launch of a payload from the hull of what may be a docked RAN Collins class submarine based on a flag seen in the background. What is being fired and why is not entirely clear, but it has a torpedo-like outward appearance and could be an expendable countermeasure of some kind. The U.S. Navy and others have also been actively working on submarine-launched aerial drones and UUVs, including types small enough to be launched from existing countermeasures launchers. A screen capture showing the payload launch. Australian Department of Defense capture Another view of the payload launch. Australian Department of Defense capture 'A versatile and robust software-defined network architecture called Multi-Domain Uncrewed Secure Integrated Communications (MUSIC) was tested for its ability to enable seamless communication and coordination across diverse unmanned systems and operational environments' during Autonomous Warrior 2024, according to a Pentagon press release. 'The Common Control System (CCS) was also featured in the exercise, built on an open architecture to provide uncrewed vehicles hardware and software that works across several different systems. This effort supports future work to create an AUKUS-wide Common Control System, fusing [the] best elements of the three countries’ existing systems.' The three AUKUS partners increasingly see uncrewed maritime platforms above and below the waves, as well as aerial drones, as not only important, but critical for providing increased sensor coverage, wider and more resilient communications networks, and other capabilities, and for doing so in cost-effective manners. The U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps, in particular, are envisioning future fleets of UUVs and USVs that can carry out kinetic attacks and employ electronic warfare and other non-kinetic effects, as well as emplace mines. The US Navy envisions its future Orca UUVs, the first of which is seen here with its top-mounted mast deployed and a payload module installed with a top-opening bay, as being uncrewed mine layers, at least initially. USN Evidence continues to grow from wargames carried out by the U.S. military and other organizations that uncrewed aerial and maritime capabilities could have especially decisive impacts in a future high-end fight across the broad expanses of the Pacific against China, especially one over Taiwan. With this in mind, America's armed forces have been helping Taiwan with a plan to defend the island against an invasion from the mainland by turning the airspace and waters into a 'hellscape' full of uncrewed platforms, as you can read more about here. 'Autonomous Warrior/Maritime Big Play creates a unique opportunity for our three countries to work together, which will ultimately improve operational efficiency and allow us to work more cohesively against common threats,' Heidi Shyu, Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, said in a statement about Autonomous Warrior 2024 this week. 'This collaborative approach enables us to reduce acquisition, maintenance, and training cost by creating economies of scale.' It's worth noting here that members of the Japan Self-Defense Forces observed Autonomous Warrior 2024, which was the first time members of that country's armed forces had been present at a Maritime Big Play event. Australian military officials brief their Japanese counterparts during Autonomous Warrior 2024. Australian Department of Defense 'All of this together underpins a more strategic approach to ensure that AUKUS and like-minded partners can operate new autonomous uncrewed systems more effectively as a coalition force from the start,' Madeline Mortelmans, the U.S. official currently performing the duties of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy, Plans and Capabilities, also said in a statement about Autonomous Warrior 2024 this week. The AUKUS triumvirate is now reportedly considering increasing Japan's involvement in Pillar II activities. This is in line with broader and largely U.S.-led efforts to create a more unified front among allies and partners in the Pacific to challenge Beijing. 'AUKUS partners have long histories of working together on defense and security issues, and have deep, enduring partnerships based on shared values,' Under Secretary Shyu said. 'By investing in novel and innovative capabilities directly aligned to AUKUS mission priorities, as well as making future advancements in emerging technologies like AI [artificial intelligence] and Quantum [computing], we support a more stable region — one where all nations are empowered to make their own sovereign decisions free from coercion — a world that centers on hope for the opportunity and prosperity of the future.' Ghost Shark, which we have now finally seen plying its way underwater, and the platforms involved in Autonomous Warrior 2024 all reflect this broader vision of the coming uncrewed ecosystem.

Germany Plans To Buy Advanced New Taurus Cruise Missiles: Report	Germany has announced plans to acquire 600 examples of a new version of the Taurus air-launched conventional cruise missile, which would provide a major boost to the country’s long-range strike capabilities. Unclear is whether the Taurus Neo purchase might finally see approval for the transfer of older Taurus KEPD 350 weapons to Ukraine, with Berlin so far having blocked such a move despite Kyiv’s requests for them. Even if Ukraine gets its wish, it will be a long time before the Taurus Neo comes online, potentially freeing up older KEPD 350 versions. The German Minister of Defense Boris Pistorius wants to buy advanced versions of the missiles, but has yet to secure funds from the government, according to a report in the Spiegel magazine. A Taurus KEPD 350 cruise missile is loaded onto a German Tornado strike aircraft. MBDA MBDA The same source states that the 600 new missiles would cost around $2.3 billion and could see the first deliveries in 2029. Pistorius plans for the Taurus Neo to be included as an option in the 2025 budget, which would require a starting investment of around $379 million. The Luftwaffe or German Air Force already received 600 of the original Taurus KEPD 350 missiles, which have a range of more than 500 kilometers (311 miles). In German service, these are launched from the Tornado swing-wing strike fighter. Although they have also been tested from the Eurofighter EF2000, the Luftwaffe doesn’t currently use the more modern fighter as a Taurus delivery platform. A German Eurofighter EF2000 jet seen carrying a pair of Taurus cruise missiles, but the capability to employ them from EF2000s was never fully developed. Philipp Hayer/Wikimedia Commons It’s unclear what platform the Taurus Neo would be launched from, but the upcoming retirement of the Tornado fleet makes this much less likely. That would leave the Eurofighter as the most likely option. Potential integration on the F-35A stealth fighter, which Germany has also ordered, seems highly unlikely, with the missile needing a significant redesign to even fit in the internal weapons bay on the U.S.-made jet. Looking further ahead, Germany could plan to add the Taurus Neo to the crewed fighter that will be at the center of the next-generation combat aircraft program being pursued by Belgium, France, Germany, and Spain, known as the Future Combat Air System, or FCAS. The original Taurus KEPD 350 was designed to destroy high-value targets deep behind enemy lines, including command bunkers, ammunition and fuel dumps, airfields, and bridges. A Taurus missile in flight. Photo by South Korean Defense Ministry via Getty Images Designed to penetrate air defenses via a very low-level terrain following flight, the turbojet-powered Taurus missile carries a 1,060-pound dual-stage warhead, known as MEPHISTO. This uses a precursor charge to punch through hardened structures followed by the main change that can be fuzed for penetration mode when required, meaning it detonates after breaching the target. The MEPHISTO warhead can also be programmed to detonate on a specific pre-selected floor of a given building. The missile guidance system is based on an inertial navigation system (INS) that is continuously provided with GPS updates. There is also an image-based terrain reference sensor, which provides the capability to attack what the manufacturer describes as 'semi-stationary targets.' There are so far no details available about the improvements planned for the Taurus Neo, although potential changes could involve extended range, more destructive warhead, low-observable features, a new seeker, or a combination of these. Less likely, but also potentially under consideration could be increased speed, perhaps combined with defensive countermeasures to better defeat advanced air defense systems. Other modifications to improve the chances of penetrating hostile air defenses could include electronic support measures (ESM) to autonomously avoid the highest-threat areas. There’s also the possibility of a new-production version of the missile with relatively minor changes compared with the original KEPD 350. Speaking this summer, Thomas Gottschild, the managing director of MBDA Deutschland GmbH, which makes the missile, confirmed that although not currently in production, the assembly line could be reactivated at short notice. 'What we need is an order to activate our supply chain, a good dozen suppliers contribute to a complex missile like Taurus. These suppliers only start working for us with an order,' Gottschild said. However, the high costs involved in the program suggest that the Taurus Neo will likely feature several enhancements over its predecessor. Two quick points: First, 2029 is obviously a long way off, with even more time until the order is fully completed—if it reaches that scale.Second, funding has yet to be secured, and hopefully, they will manage to source the necessary budget. In my view, this should be an…&mdash; Fabian Hoffmann (@FRHoffmann1) October 25, 2024 The news of Germany’s Taurus Neo plans comes just two days after the signing of a landmark defense agreement between Germany and the United Kingdom, which you can read more about here. The two countries agreed to work together to 'rapidly develop' new extended deep strike weapons. Although no more details were provided, such weapons are planned to fly further and attack targets with greater precision than the Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missile used by the U.K. Royal Air Force. That agreement followed the announcement at the NATO Defense Ministers meeting in Brussels last week that the United Kingdom was joining the European Long-Range Strike Approach (ELSA) initiative, a French-led effort that involves Germany, Poland, and Italy. Previous announcements state that ELSA envisages a missile with a range of between 1,000 and 2,000 kilometers (621 and 1,243 miles) and that it should be in service by the 2030s. The will join the European long-range Strike Approach. Working alongside international allies, including our key ally , we will develop new long range missile capabilities to meet a critical NATO capability priority and bolster European security.#StrongerTogether UK Defence in France (@UKDefenceFrance) October 18, 2024 Exactly how the Taurus Neo would fit into either of these programs is unclear, but it provides more evidence of the growing interest in long-range strike weapons in Europe. The United States and Germany have also announced that U.S. long-range missiles will be stationed in Germany on an 'episodic' basis starting in 2026, including the SM-6 multi-purpose missile and Tomahawk cruise missile as well as 'developmental hypersonic weapons,' which is a likely reference to the Dark Eagle, which is due to be fielded soon, and others. The renewed focus on long-range strike has been driven, above all, by developments in Russian tactical nuclear missiles, which are being fielded in increasingly advanced and long-reaching forms. New types of missiles and new deployments have been accompanied by repeated nuclear threats from President Vladimir Putin as well as suggestions that Russia’s threshold for the potential use of nuclear weapons may have been lowered. The Taurus KEPD 350 is broadly similar to the Storm Shadow and SCALP-EG cruise missiles, which have been supplied to Ukraine by the United Kingdom, France, and Italy. A donated British Storm Shadow cruise missile carried under the wing of a Ukrainian Su-24 strike aircraft. via X Twitter screencap However, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has repeatedly denied requests by Ukraine to supply it with the Taurus. The German government has cited its concerns over Ukraine using the missile to strike targets deep inside Russia. The Storm Shadow and SCALP-EG were supplied to Kyiv on the understanding that they wouldn’t be used for such missions, though there have been reports that these restrictions might have been at least partially relaxed. The fact that Germany has decided it needs air-launched cruise missiles at this point may well also be another factor against Ukraine getting older Taurus KEPD 350 weapons. With a clear demand for weapons in this class, the current stocks of KEPD 350s are only likely to be retained longer, pending the introduction of the Taurus Neo. Of the original 600 Taurus KEPD 350s reported once in the German inventory, as many as half of these are said to be not ready for operational use after their certification expired. Stocks will also have been depleted over the years through examples being expended in tests or exercises, reducing the number that would be available to Ukraine. Should the German Ministry of Defense receive the funds it needs for the Taurus Neo program, it would ensure that the country’s air-launched long-range conventional strike capabilities keep pace with broader developments in air warfare. While it could allow the Taurus KEPD 350 to be phased out, along with the Tornado that carries it, it won’t necessarily see the older missiles approved for transfer to Ukraine, which is something that Berlin has stubbornly resisted so far.

Russians Helped Houthis Target International Shipping: Report	During its nine-month deployment to the Middle East, the USS Dwight D Eisenhower carrier strike group (IKECSG) fired off nearly 800 munitions fending off attacks on its ships and commercial vessels from the Houthis. Now a new report claims Russia gave the Yemeni rebel group targeting data in large measure to keep the U.S. entangled in the region and draw resources and attention away from Moscow's grinding war in Ukraine. The Houthis began attacking shipping in October of 2023 in support of Gaza and 'eventually began using Russian satellite data as they expanded their strikes,' The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. The publication cited 'a person familiar with the matter and two European defense officials.' The data 'was passed through members of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), who were embedded with the Houthis in Yemen,' one of the people told the Journal. Breaking: Russia provided satellite targeting data for Houthi rebels as they attacked Western ships in the Red Sea with missiles and drones earlier this year The Wall Street Journal (@WSJ) October 24, 2024 There is no indication in the Wall Street Journal’s report exactly when the data was supplied or if it contributed to any of the successful attacks on shipping. Regardless, the publication said it highlighted Russian President Vladimir Putin’s interest in undermining what the Pentagon keeps referring to as the U.S.-led 'rules-based order.' Responding to discussions about the U.S. and allies allowing Ukraine to strike deep into Russia with its donated weaponry, Putin threatened to send long-range weapons and military support to 'regions' around the world where they could be used for strikes against Western targets. 'For Russia, any flare-up anywhere is good news, because it takes the world’s attention further away from Ukraine,' Alexander Gabuev, director of Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, a think tank based in Berlin, told WSJ. Houthi attacks on shipping sucked up a lot of U.S. and allied resources. In addition to the IKECSG’s ships and aircraft, several other American and allied sea and air assets took part in defending shipping. They swatted away missiles and drones and blew up uncrewed surface vessels. They also attacked Houthi targets in Yemen. As we reported last week, B-2 Spirit stealth bombers, along with other U.S. forces, conducted a strike on Houthi underground weapon storage sites in Yemen. Land-based aircraft and other assets also took part in the fight. Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro disclosed at a Congressional hearing in April that his service alone had already expended at least $1 billion worth of munitions in operations against the Houthis since October 2023 and in the defense of Israel that month. The Navy was reported to have hit the 100 Standard Missiles fired mark by February of this year. The Dwight D. Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group expended 770 missiles and other munitions at Houthi targets over the course of its nine-month deployment. Capt. Chris 'Chowdah' Hill/USN There were also two international task forces created to defend Red Sea region shipping. The U.S.-led Operation Prosperity Guardian, which The War Zone was the first to write about, was stood up last December. The European-led Operation Aspides launched two months later. Despite all these assets deployed to the region, the Houthis kept up their attacks. Since launching this campaign a year ago, the militants attacked more than 100 ships, sinking two, damaging others, and hijacking another, the Journal noted. The following video shows the November 2023 Houthi hijacking of the Bahamian-flagged Galaxy Leader. NEW VIDEO: Yemen’s Houthi rebels hijack a cargo ship in the Red Sea over the weekend pic.twitter.com/pkkUJpbe5c&mdash; Trey Yingst (@TreyYingst) November 20, 2023 Those attacks disrupted global shipping, forcing companies to shift from passing through the Suez Canal to taking much longer, and more expensive routes around the Cape of Good Hope on the southern tip of Africa. 'Almost 1-in-10 barrels of oil shipped every day worldwide transit through Bab al-Mandab, the strait that separates the Red Sea from the Indian Ocean,' the Journal noted. 'The tanker traffic through that route was 77% lower in August 2024 compared with October 2023, according to Windward, a maritime-intelligence company.' Russian oil tankers have been hit by the Houthis as well, but they are part of a 'ghost fleet' created to circumvent international sanctions. Concerns about Russian assistance to the Houthis go beyond providing targeting data. The U.S. has been worried that Russia could further exacerbate the situation by providing the Houthis with its anti-ship or anti-air missiles as well as other weapons. Those arms could hinder efforts to protect shipping and place U.S. and allied forces at greater risk. However, there is no evidence that such transactions have occurred. Such a move would provide a huge boost to the large arsenal of anti-ship missiles already possessed by the Houthis, who became the first in the world to fire anti-ship ballistic missiles in anger. In addition to helping the Houthis, Russia may also be aiding Hezbollah in its fight against Israel. Last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israeli forces had found 'state-of-the-art' Russian weapons in searches of Hezbollah bases in south Lebanon. However, those weapons could also have been transferred by Iran or obtained by other means. Some of those weapons are on display in the following video.

We reached out to the National Security Council and the Pentagon for comment about the claim that Russia provided the Houthis with targeting data and if so, what they might do in response.

Marines Testing Counter-Drone Rifle Aiming System With Automatica...	The U.S. Marines are testing a system for standard service rifles that automatically fine-tunes the point of aim with the help of a powered buttstock as a new option to help shoot down drones. The service is in the midst of a broad push to acquire new capabilities to help every Marine better protect themselves from ever-growing uncrewed aerial threats. The 3rd Marine Division in Hawaii released pictures today from a live-fire demonstration of a 5.56x45mm M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle (IAR) equipped with the ZeroMark Fire Control System (FCS). ZeroMark is a New York-based startup that was founded in 2022 and that says it has 'deep roots in Israel.' The company announced a new infusion of $7 million in venture capital funding to support the ongoing development of its counter-drone FCS back in May. A Marine fires an M27 IAR equipped with the ZeroMark FCS during a recent live-fire demonstration in Hawaii. USMC 'The ZeroMark FCS is an AI [artificial intelligence]-powered tool that enhances aim accuracy and counter-drone capabilities, providing Marines with a portable, real-time threat detection and response tool,' a caption for one of the pictures from the 3rd Marine Division says. C-UAS in soldiers’ hands.AI-powered accuracy.It’s coming. pic.twitter.com/hh38ON9Lfa&mdash; ZeroMark (@zeromarkinc) November 16, 2023 ZeroMark's system is not the first automated small arms targeting system the Marines have looked into in recent years with a particular eye toward helping engage drones. The service has also at least been evaluating SMASH 2000-series computerized optical sights from Israeli firm Smart Shooter. SMASH-series sights have the ability to detect and lock onto targets of interest, even ones on the move, and calculate an optimal aim point for the shooter. Depending on how the system is configured on a particular gun, it can even prevent the trigger from being pulled until the weapon is properly aimed at the target. The targeting system in ZeroMark's FCS is similar, in some very broad strokes, to that of the SMASH family. It uses an array of sensors, including electro-optical cameras and LIDAR, coupled with machine vision and advanced software algorithms, to acquire targets, according to the company. Where ZeroMark's offering differs most substantially is in its motorized articulating buttstock, which uses the data from the sensors to help physically move the gun's point of aim. This, in turn, helps the shooter engage the target with greater precision and speed. Screen captures from a ZeroMark promotional video seen earlier in this story showing how the buttstock is designed to articulate vertically (for evaluation) and laterally (for windage). ZeroMark captures '[The mechanized buttstock] doesn’t move the soldier’s arm, it creates a virtual pivot between shoulder pad and handheld positions that creates angular change of the bore axis (ultimately where the gun’s pointed),' ZeroMark CEO Joel Anderson said in an interview earlier this year, according to TechCrunch. 'The control systems for it are modeled to compensate for all the human factors (proprioception, noise, movement, torque, etc.) as well as the drone’s movement. So if you point in the general direction of the drone such that you’d be in the vicinity of a drone, the system does the rest.' Zeromark says it is also easy to install and uninstall as required on a wide variety of different rifle types. A promotional video seen earlier in this story shows prototypes or mock-ups of the system installed on rifles in the AK-47/AKM, AR-15/M16, and Tavor families, as seen below. ZeroMark captures Overall, ZeroMark says its FCS 'makes hitting a small drone at 200 yards as easy as hitting a 60-foot-diameter circle' at the same range, per TechCrunch. At least for now, the company has said work on its targeting system is focused on the counter-drone role, but has acknowledged that its system could be adapted for use against a wider array of target types in the future. The Marine Corps' interest in new ways to neutralize drones that it can add to its existing rifles and other small arms is certainly no secret. The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) put out a broad request for information (RFI) back in July that included a call for proposals for 'a rifle / rifle optic capable of tracking and defeating small UAS [uncrewed aerial systems],' as well as rifle-mounted electronic warfare jammers, specialized ammunition types, and other counter-small UAS (CsUAS) capabilities. 'The Joint CsUAS Office (JCO) has identified dismounted CsUAS capabilities as a vulnerability to the joint force. The Marine Corps Warfighting Lab (MCWL) identified the need for dismounted CsUAS throughout multiple experiments,' the RFI explained. 'Additionally, Tactical Training and Exercise Control Group (TTECG), Infantry Officer Course (IOC), both Schools of Infantry (SOI), and other units continue to fly threat UAS against Marine units during field exercises and training events. Each experiment and training exercise shows Marines are vulnerable to threat UAS and require the ability to defend themselves from the threat.' A US Marine with a standard M27 IAR. USMC This followed the Corps unveiling a three-tier plan to improve the ability of units at all levels to shield themselves from drones earlier this year. 'The threat is evolving in real time,' Lt. Col. Robert Barclay, the Marines’ ground-based air defense advisor for aviation expeditionary enablers, said at the Modern Day Marine expo in May. 'We were playing a cat-and-mouse game a lot of times, and that quite frankly gets a little cumbersome, and you don’t want to be behind the power curve.' The threat posed by various tiers of uncrewed aerial systems, including highly maneuverable first-person view (FPV) types turned into kamikaze drones and other weaponized commercial designs capable of dropping small improvised munitions, is not new. This is something The War Zone routinely highlights and the threat ecosystem looks to be on the verge of taking another major step forward thanks in large part to advances in artificial intelligence. The ongoing war in Ukraine, where both sides employ FPV and other drone types on a daily basis, has been especially central to finally thrusting the reality of drone threats into the mainstream consciousness. A global explosion of demand for counter-drone capabilities, including ones that individual personnel can carry, has followed.

U.S. Pushes Back On Claim Israel Delaying Iran Attack Over Docume...	The U.S. is pushing back against a claim made by The Times of London that Israel is delaying its expected retaliation strike against Iran because of the leak of a U.S. assessment of its war plans. 'We have no indication that Israel is delaying any action because of the document leak,' a U.S. official told The War Zone Thursday morning. 'Would steer you away from that.' Top secret documents leaked from the U.S. National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA) appeared last week on a pro-Iranian Telegram channel. They offered details about Israel’s advanced preparations for a large-scale strike in retaliation for the Oct. 1 Iranian missile barrage. The U.S. has not disputed their authenticity. It is possible Iran has obtained other documents not yet disclosed and it could signify a longer-term leak of information that remains unquantified, at least publicly. 'The leak of the American documents delayed the attack due to the need to change certain strategies and components,' an 'intelligence source with knowledge of Israeli deliberations' told The Times of London. 'There will be a retaliation, but it has taken longer than it was supposed to take.' Many factors can play into a military operation's timeline, especially an unprecedented one that would be highly complex and stretch Israel's long-range strike abilities. More basic elements are also important, including weather and moon states that are favorable to the operation and NEW: Israel has delayed its retaliatory strike against Iran because of a leak last week of potentially sensitive military information from the US The Times and The Sunday Times (@thetimes) October 24, 2024 Israel 'is concerned the leak could help Iran predict certain patterns of attack,' according to the publication. 'It has been forced to develop an alternative plan, one that requires detailed war gaming before any order is given, The Times understands.' The Netanyahu government has told the U.S. it won't strike Iran's nuclear facilities or oil infrastructure, the Washington Post reported. Instead, it will likely strike military targets. The Biden administration is working feverishly to tamp down tensions. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday that Israel's retaliation should not lead to greater escalation. Unlike the last rounds of attacks the two nations carried out against each other, an Israeli strike against Iran is likely to receive a quick response, setting off what could be a prolonged direct conflict between the long-time enemies.

B-21 Raider Fleet Size Under Review	The expected size of the U.S. Air Force's B-21 Raider fleet could change as part of an ongoing force structure review, according to the bomber's manufacturer Northrop Grumman. The company is also expecting to get another B-21 low-rate production contract by the end of the year, which follows steadily progressing ground and flight testing work. Kathy Warden, Northrop Grumman's CEO, talked about the present state of the B-21 program and her company's expectations for the future during a quarterly earnings call earlier today. The Air Force's publicly stated plan has long been to buy at least 100 Raiders, but there have been discussions for years now about the possibility of the service acquiring significantly more of the bombers. 'I think that's exactly what the Air Force is looking at,' Warden said. 'They are undertaking a force structure design review and the Secretary [of the Air Force Frank Kendall] has been open about looking at the various options they have for increasing their force size, and has talked specifically about NGAD, and we know that B-21 is in the mix, as well.' Warden was responding to a question about how any fallout from the Air Force's reassessment of its plans for a new crewed sixth-generation stealth 'fighter' as part of the larger Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative might impact the B-21 and other programs. The NGAD combat jet effort's future is now very uncertain amid a deep re-examination of what the aircraft might be expected to do as a part of efforts to drive down costs, as you can read more about here. Broader concerns about the outlook for U.S. defense budgets in the coming years, as well as increasing costs for other top-priority efforts, especially the ballooning price of the LGM-35A Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile program, have also factored into the NGAD review. Northrop Grumman notably voluntarily withdrew from the competition to develop the NGAD combat jet, at least as a prime contractor, last year. A rendering of various existing advanced Northrop Grumman aircraft designs and future concepts, including a notional crewed stealth combat aircraft at left. Northrop Grumman 'It would be premature for me to suggest where that force structure review will end up,' Warden added during the call today. 'I do think in the coming months, we may get a better indication from the Air Force as to how they're thinking about B-21 quantities in the long run.' The War Zone has reached out to the Air Force for more information. New questions about the Air Force's expected B-21 fleet size had already emerged earlier this year. Gen. David Allvin, the service's Chief of Staff, caused a stir at a Congressional hearing in April when he declined to commit to buying more than 100 Raiders and talked about his service already looking to future capabilities to augment the bombers. A key known requirement for the B-21 already is the ability to operate in a pilot-optional mode. 'It [the B-21] certainly is the future of our bomber force. … 100 is the program of record,' Allvin said at the time. 'I think we’re not going to reach that number until probably the mid-2030s and beyond. And before we commit to that as being the platform beyond that, I think there are other technological advancements that we would see to be able to augment that and have a better mix.' The War Zone has previously explored in detail how the Air Force looking beyond the B-21 now makes good sense. The air combat realities that the entire U.S. military has to contend with continue to rapidly evolve, especially when it comes to future planning around a potential high-end fight, such as one in the Pacific against China. Advances in the uncrewed aviation and artificial and machine learning sectors are particularly significant factors in these broader developments. Photo courtesy of Jonathan Case, Northrop Grumman It is worth noting here that there is the potential that a review of the B-21 force structure plans, especially in relation to what could happen with the NGAD combat jet, might actually lead to an increase in Raider acquisitions. The possibility of B-21s, or a variant or derivative of that design, supporting NGAD-related air dominance missions is something The War Zone and Air Force officials have raised in the past. 'In the short run, we may remain very focused on delivering them optionality, the performance that we are delivering gives them a capability that is in production now that is well below the cost targets for the platform, and we believe that that's the role of industry to get the government options as they think about their force structure,' Northrop Grumman's Warden also said during today's earnings call. Northrop Grumman has delivered at least one of six pre-production B-21s and has begun work on the first low-rate initial production (LRIP) lot of Raiders. The company is expecting to get a contract for the second LRIP lot in the fourth quarter of 2024. 'We have no change to pricing,' Warden said today. 'We are continuing to perform&#8230; in alignment with the plan that we have laid out for the B-21 and I'm very proud of that team. It's quite a remarkable accomplishment.' In January, Northrop Grumman had disclosed a loss of nearly $1.2 billion on the B-21 program and its expectation that it would take a financial hit on each of the first five LRIP lots. 'Macroeconomic disruptions,' which could include higher-than-expected inflation and other broader economic factors, were cited as the cause of the losses. Though the exact current estimated unit cost of the Raider is unknown, Northrop Grumman continues to say it is under the Air Force's target of $550 million in Fiscal Year 2010 dollars, or around $793 million when adjusted for inflation.

USAF 'The B-21 program has also made solid progress in achieving ground and flight testing milestones on the development contract, and is continuing to execute the aircraft production contract in line with our estimates,' Warden added today. Northrop Grumman and the Air Force had already provided a substantial update on B-21 testing activities, including work using two non-flying ground test articles, around the Air & Space Forces Association's main annual conference back in September. Officials at that time highlighted how the tempo of flight testing using the initial pre-production Raider had increased to two flights per week. The Air Force's publicly stated goal remains to begin fielding B-21s operationally before 2030, with Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota slated to be the first base to host combat-coded Raider squadrons. Additional B-21 squadrons are set to be based at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, the current home of the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber fleet, and Dyess Air Force Base in Texas. There are now new questions about exactly what the full B-21 force layout might look like, even as testing and initial production of the bombers are expanding.

Poland’s F-16s Cleared For Major Upgrades	Poland has taken the next step in the modernization of its air force, with U.S. approval given for a major upgrade of its fleet of F-16 fighters. The program will bring the jets to the F-16V standard and also suggests new weapons may be introduced, too. The Viper Midlife Upgrade is announced as Poland awaits F-35s and considers buying F-15EXs, while making significant investments in its armed forces across the board, to meet the threat from Russia. As is typically the case for major U.S. arms sales, the Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) announced the State Department’s approval of the F-16 package for Poland yesterday. Poland’s Viper Midlife Upgrade would be valued at around $7.3 billion. Under the proposed deal, the full fleet of 48 Polish Air Force F-16C/D Block 52+ jets would be upgraded, receiving a considerable boost in capabilities. A Polish Air Force F-16C with conformal fuel tanks (CFTs) fitted. Polish Air Force Polish Armed Forces/Piotr Łysakowski It is important to stress that approved foreign arms sales announced through DSCA are not final and are subject to change, including as a result of negotiations between the country in question and relevant defense contractors. Nevertheless, at the center of the upgrade is the Northrop Grumman AN/APG-83 active Scalable Agile Beam Radars (SABR), an electronically scanned array (AESA) radar which you can read more about in detail here. A Northrop Grumman AN/APG-83 SABR radar installed on an F-16. U.S. Air Force USAF / Bobbi Zapka This will be combined with a new Modular Mission Computer as well as a Next Generation Mission Computer or equivalent. The pilots will be provided with Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing Systems (JHMCS II), an upgraded and improved version of the original JHMCS that Poland already uses. Other avionics include Embedded Global Positioning System (GPS) Inertial Navigation Systems (INS), AN/APX-126/127 Advanced Identification Friend or Foe (AIFF) with combined interrogator/transponder, and AN/ARC-238 radios (or equivalent). In terms of self-protection equipment, the upgraded F-16s would be fitted with either the AN/ALQ-254V(1) Viper Shield or AN/ALQ-257 Integrated Viper Electronic Warfare Suite (IVEWS), which aligns with reports earlier this year that Northrop Grumman and L3Harris were facing off to provide the central electronic warfare component of an expected upgrade package for the Polish jets. Other self-protection gear outlined by the DCSA announcement comprises Passive Airborne Warning System (PAWS-2) missile warning systems and AN/ALE-47 countermeasures dispensers. The offensive weapons outlined in the package are all test and training versions and comprise three AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) captive-carry flight test vehicles, three GBU-53/B Small Diameter Bomb II (SDB II) guided test vehicles, eight SDB II captive-carry reliability trainers, and two GBU-39(T-1)/B Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) guided test vehicles. Notably, neither the GBU-39/B nor the GBU-53/B, the latter of which is also known as the StormBreaker, are currently in the Polish arsenal. There are also two AIM-9X Block II Sidewinder special air training missiles and two AIM-9X captive air training missiles. A U.S. Air Force F-16D carrying a load of StormBreakers during a test. Raytheon F-16D carrying a load of StormBreakers during a test. (Raytheon) With no operational weaponry included so far, these stores will be used for developmental test of the F-16V for Poland. They provide a fairly good indication of some of the munitions that are likely to be procured by the Polish Air Force in the future. The DSCA statement on the approved sale also references MS-110 reconnaissance pods, although the number is not disclosed. Polish F-16s already fly with the dual-band DB-110 tactical reconnaissance pod, the precursor to the current MS-110, which adds a multi-spectral imaging (MSI) capability. 'The F-16 Viper mid-life upgrade will bolster Poland’s air defense and surveillance capabilities, support national security, and strengthen Poland’s defense and contributions to NATO,' the DSCA states. No timelines for Poland’s potential Viper Midlife Upgrade were announced. Upgrading the F-16 — known locally as the Jastrzab, or Hawk — makes a lot of sense for Poland, with the 48 examples (36 single-seat F-16Cs and 12 two-seat F-16Ds) set to be Poland’s most important combat aircraft for some time to come. These fighters currently serve with three squadrons, two of them based in Poznan-Krzesiny and one at Łask. These aircraft are already highly capable and among the most potent F-16s of any NATO operator. A Polish F-16 preparing for a night flight at Trapani Air Base, Italy, during the Trident Juncture 15 exercise. Antonio Valentino/Wikimedia Commons OR9 Antonio VALENTINO_ITA_AF_50th Wing Piacenza The jets can be configured with conformal fuel tanks (CFTs) and are armed with AIM-120C-5/7 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) and AIM-9X Sidewinder that can be fired off-boresight using the JHMCS. Current offensive stores include the AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missile, AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW), and AGM-158A/B Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), as well as Paveway laser-guided bombs, and Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM). The aircraft are fitted with Sniper targeting pods. Once upgraded, Poland’s F-16s will remain highly viable until the F-35s become fully operationally capable and will be able to fight alongside those jets after. Furthermore, as has been pointed out in the past, the F-16V upgrade should also help the Polish Air Force integrate the F-35, with some significant commonality in terms of avionics, especially the radars. The urgency of keeping the Polish fighter force at the top of its game — through new acquisitions and modernization programs — has been driven by the changing security situation in Eastern Europe, especially since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. This has accelerated plans to replace Poland’s Cold War-era fleet of Soviet-made MiG-29 Fulcrum and Su-22 Fitter combat aircraft. A pair of Polish MIG-29s take part in a NATO exercise at Łask Air Base, Poland, in October 2022. Photo by Omar Marques/Getty Images Omar Marques Today, just 14 MiG-29s remain in service, after the transfer of a similar number to Ukraine in 2023, to restock its Fulcrum fleet that has been ravaged during the war with Russia. Poland is expected to retire its last MiG-29s in 2027. Meanwhile, the last of the aging Su-22 Fitter swing-wing ground-attack/strike aircraft are now scheduled for withdrawal next year. The new security situation has also led to Poland considering the possibility of arming its future F-35s with U.S. B61-12 thermonuclear bombs in the future, as you can read about here. Outfitting F-16s with these weapons also remains a possibility, although the stealth fighter offers many more advantages in the nuclear strike role. Poland will start to receive its new fifth-generation fighters soon. The first F-35A from an order for 32 was officially rolled out in August in a ceremony at Lockheed Martin’s Fort Worth, Texas plant. The first pair of F-35s — locally named Husarz, or Hussar — are scheduled to be delivered in December. Poland’s first F-35A was officially rolled out on August 28 in a ceremony at Lockheed Martin’s Fort Worth, Texas plant. Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin There is also the possibility that Poland might further increase its fighter inventory, adding another new type in the shape of the F-15EX, the latest version of the Eagle. Boeing made an announcement about its pitch to sell an unspecified number of F-15EXs to Poland in September last year, as we wrote about at the time. As we noted then, even a relatively small F-15EX buy could be very useful for Poland, providing a platform with some niche capabilities that the F-16 and the F-35 can’t necessarily provide. In particular, the Eagle II offers significantly greater range and payload capacity that could be particularly useful for Poland when it comes to protecting the country’s airspace, where stealth would not necessarily be as critical, and increasing its capacity to conduct standoff strikes against surface targets. The ability to carry future hypersonic weapons could also be attractive as Poland seeks to further develop its long-range strike capabilities. A U.S. Air Force F-15EX armed with 12 AIM-120 AMRAAMs. U.S. Air Force SSgt. Blake Wiles Poland has also recently introduced yet another warplane, the South Korea-made FA-50 light combat aircraft. In July last year, Warsaw signed an agreement with Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) to buy 48 FA-50s, as part of a huge arms transfer from South Korea to Poland. The jets are being rapidly delivered to backfill combat aircraft numbers after the transfer of 14 MiG-29s to Ukraine and the forthcoming retirement of the Su-22. To speed up the deliveries, Poland is receiving the FA-50s in two discrete configurations. The first 12 FA-50s, in Block 10 standard, were delivered to Poland in mid-2023. The next batch of 36 aircraft will be in the more advanced Block 20 configuration, including active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, Sniper targeting pod, Link 16 datalink, and AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles. Deliveries of the Block 20 aircraft are due to begin next year. Recently, there has been some criticism of the FA-50 buy and, especially, the lack of certain weapons for these aircraft. Mariusz Blaszczak, Poland’s Minister of National Defense during the presentation of the first FA-50 for the Poland, at Minsk Mazowiecki Air Base, Poland, on August 21, 2023. Photo by Foto Olimpik/NurPhoto via Getty Images NurPhoto NurPhoto In a parliamentary speech last month, Poland’s Deputy Minister of Defense Cezary Tomczyk derided the FA-50s as 'a training-combat aircraft that is for training but not for combat.' The main point of concern is the integration of AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles, which were expected for the Block 20 version, but which KAI now says could take much longer — if it’s even feasible. '[AMRAAM integration] requires U.S. approval,' Chongho Yoon, the vice president of KAI, told Defense24.com. 'A feasibility study is underway; all is to happen in three to four years. Technically this is doable, but other areas need to be addressed. KAI is currently working on such research and the matter is to be clarified in two to three years.' Whether or not the FA-50s eventually receive AMRAAM, they will at least benefit from being compatible with other weapons used by the F-16. Should Poland buy more weapons for its upgraded Vipers, these could also be used to arm the FA-50 fleet. Polish F-16s with Sniper pods on their engine intakes. Photo by RADOSLAW JOZWIAK/AFP via Getty Images RADOSLAW JOZWIAK As well as new combat aircraft, Poland is also investing in its broader air defense architecture, notably receiving U.S. approval to purchase elements of a new airborne early warning system based on an aerostat — a type of uncrewed tethered airship. You can read more about that intriguing project, which has parallels with the canceled American system known as JLENS, in this previous article. While not unexpected, the announcement of the proposed Viper upgrade for Poland is yet more evidence of the country’s efforts to strengthen its air force as it seeks to provide a more effective deterrent to possible Russian aggression as well as a more capable bulwark should Moscow make a move against Poland or another NATO state in the region, something that officials are increasingly concerned about. This military expansion is reflected across the Polish Armed Forces and has been aided by a hike in defense expenditure, with Warsaw now spending 4.23 percent of its GDP on its armed forces, more than double the NATO target of two percent. The All in all, Poland’s increasingly powerful air force reflects the country’s defense-spending spree, as fears of Russian aggression grow in the wake of the all-out invasion of Ukraine. With Poland spending 4.23 percent of its GDP on its armed forces, more than double the NATO target of two percent, the forthcoming F-35 fleet will be one of the most potent — and capable — symbols of the country’s rapid military modernization.

French Mirage 2000s Destined For Ukraine Will Fly With Storm Shad...	France announced it will deliver three of its Dassault Mirage 2000 multi-role aircraft to Ukraine in the first half of 2025, according to the Ukrainian Defense Post news outlet, citing French media. It is the first tranche of an undisclosed number of the jets France said it will give to Ukraine. 'The Mirage 2000s that will be delivered to Ukraine will be equipped with new equipment,' French Armed Forces Minister Sébastien Lecornu said in an interview with Bordeaux-based news agency Sud Ouest,' Defense Post reported. 'This transformation operation will take place at the Cazaux base in Gironde. The aim is to equip them with air-to-ground combat capabilities and strengthen their electronic warfare system.' Three French Mirage 2000 fighters are scheduled to arrive in Ukraine by next March. (Photo by ludovic MARIN / AFP) (Photo by LUDOVIC MARIN/AFP via Getty Images) As we suggested back in June, it's now confirmed that the jets will be armed with versions of the MICA beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile, as well as the stealthy SCALP-EG cruise missile and the Hammer rocket-assisted precision-guided bomb, according to the French La Tribune news outlet. This is in addition to their 30mm cannons. 'But the most important thing is the training of pilots and mechanics, which is continuing in Nancy,' Lecornu added. An unknown number of Mirage 2000s are being upgraded right now for Ukraine, which will also include enhancements to their electronic warfare suite. Earlier this month, we reported that France announced details of its plans to put surplus Mirage fighters into Ukrainian hands. The delta-winged jet is set to become the second Western-made fighter to be provided to Kyiv, following the F-16, the first of which arrived in Ukraine this summer. The Latest On the battlefield, Russian troops have recently made limited advances in Kursk and eastern Ukraine, but the two sides are largely logged in a stalemate across much of the 800-mile front lines, according to the latest assessment from the Institute for the Study of War (IWS). Kursk: Russian forces recently advanced in the northern part of Ukraine’s salient. 'Geolocated footage published on October 21 indicates that Russian forces advanced in fields south of Sheptukhovka (southeast of Korenevo) during two platoon-sized mechanized assaults,' ISW stated. Kharkiv: Russian forces continued limited offensive operations in northern Kharkiv Oblast on October 22 but did not make any confirmed advances. Luhansk: Russian forces continued offensive operations along the Kupyansk-Svatove-Kreminna line on October 22, but did not make any confirmed advances. Donetsk: Russian forces recently advanced east of Kurakhove and southwest of Donetsk City near Vuhledar. However, there were no changes to the front lines near Pokrovsk, southeast of Siversk, or near Chasiv Yar and Toretsk.

French Mirage 2000s Destined For Ukraine Will Fly With Storm Shad...	France announced it will deliver three of its Dassault Mirage 2000 multi-role aircraft to Ukraine in the first half of 2025, according to the Ukrainian Defense Post news outlet, citing French media. It is the first tranche of an undisclosed number of the jets France said it will give to Ukraine. 'The Mirage 2000s that will be delivered to Ukraine will be equipped with new equipment,' French Armed Forces Minister Sébastien Lecornu said in an interview with Bordeaux-based news agency Sud Ouest,' Defense Post reported. 'This transformation operation will take place at the Cazaux base in Gironde. The aim is to equip them with air-to-ground combat capabilities and strengthen their electronic warfare system.' Three French Mirage 2000 fighters are scheduled to arrive in Ukraine by next March. (Photo by ludovic MARIN / AFP) (Photo by LUDOVIC MARIN/AFP via Getty Images) As we suggested back in June, it's now confirmed that the jets will be armed with versions of the MICA beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile, as well as the stealthy SCALP-EG cruise missile and the Hammer rocket-assisted precision-guided bomb, according to the French La Tribune news outlet. This is in addition to their 30mm cannons. 'But the most important thing is the training of pilots and mechanics, which is continuing in Nancy,' Lecornu added. An unknown number of Mirage 2000s are being upgraded right now for Ukraine, which will also include enhancements to their electronic warfare suite. Earlier this month, we reported that France announced details of its plans to put surplus Mirage fighters into Ukrainian hands. The delta-winged jet is set to become the second Western-made fighter to be provided to Kyiv, following the F-16, the first of which arrived in Ukraine this summer. The Latest On the battlefield, Russian troops have recently made limited advances in Kursk and eastern Ukraine, but the two sides are largely logged in a stalemate across much of the 800-mile front lines, according to the latest assessment from the Institute for the Study of War (IWS). Kursk: Russian forces recently advanced in the northern part of Ukraine’s salient. 'Geolocated footage published on October 21 indicates that Russian forces advanced in fields south of Sheptukhovka (southeast of Korenevo) during two platoon-sized mechanized assaults,' ISW stated. Kharkiv: Russian forces continued limited offensive operations in northern Kharkiv Oblast on October 22 but did not make any confirmed advances. Luhansk: Russian forces continued offensive operations along the Kupyansk-Svatove-Kreminna line on October 22, but did not make any confirmed advances. Donetsk: Russian forces recently advanced east of Kurakhove and southwest of Donetsk City near Vuhledar. However, there were no changes to the front lines near Pokrovsk, southeast of Siversk, or near Chasiv Yar and Toretsk. Zaporizhzhia: Russian forces continued assaults northeast of Robotyne near Mala Tokmachka on October 21 and 22, but there were no confirmed advances. Kherson: Russian forces continued attacks on the eastern bank of the Dnipro RIvert on October 21 but did not make any confirmed advances.

However, they are reportedly not the only foreigners fighting in Kursk on behalf of Russia, according to Ukrainian troops.

Unlike the USAI program, PDA funds provide goods already in U.S. stocks. The new package 'will provide Ukraine additional capabilities to meet its most urgent needs, including: munitions for rocket systems and artillery; mortar systems and rounds; armored vehicles; and anti-tank weapons,' the Pentagon said in a statement. This marks the 68th tranche of equipment to be provided from DoD inventories for Ukraine under the PDA program since August 2021. The capabilities in this announcement include: Ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS); 155mm and 105mm artillery ammunition; 60mm, 81mm, and 120mm mortar systems and rounds; Tube-launched, Optically tracked, Wire-guided (TOW) missiles; Javelin and AT-4 anti-armor systems; M113 Armored Personnel Carriers; Satellite communication equipment; Small arms and ammunition; Grenades and training equipment; Demolitions equipment and munitions; Equipment to protect critical national infrastructure; and Spare parts, ancillary equipment, services, training, and transportation.

The UK is donating those funds 'toward the Maritime Capability Coalition and is seeking partners to co-fund delivery of hundreds more maritime drones (aerial and uncrewed boats), as well as surveillance radars to protect the Grain Corridor,' U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s office announced Wednesday. 'And together, the UK and Norway are seeking a further £100 million ($129 million) to co-fund hundreds more.' The donations would boost Ukraine’s drone stocks. As we have frequently reported, its indigenously built sea drones have caused widespread havoc on Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, with attacks on ports in Crimea and ships. They have been so devastating that Russia has moved the bulk of its BSF from Crimea to Novorossysk in Russia. Ukrainian Sea Baby drones were used to attack the Kerch Bridge in July 2023.

New Ways To Stretch F/A-18 Super Hornet’s Range Sought By Navy	The U.S. Navy is asking for new ideas about how to increase the unrefueled range of its F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighters and EA-18G Growler electronic warfare aircraft. The service axed plans to give its Super Hornets range-extending conformal fuel tanks (CFT) nearly four years ago, citing technical and other issues. The Navy's MQ-25 Stingray tanker drone program has also experienced significant delays, as well as cost growth. Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) put out a contracting notice asking for information about potential 'innovative concepts' for extending the range of its Super Hornet and Growler fleets earlier today. From top to bottom, an F/A-18E, an F/A-18F, and an EA-18G. Boeing 'The intent of this RFI [request for information] is to provide&#8230; initial insight into the existence of such concepts, their potential capability to extend platform range, how the concept could be integrated into naval TACAIR [tactical aircraft], and any considerations with respect to reliability and suitability for carrier-based flight operations,' the notice says. 'It is meant to provide respondents with broad latitude to submit concepts across multiple engineering disciplines that could provide extended range capability.' 'Example areas these concepts may address include, but are NOT limited to, methods to increase lift, reduce drag, increase fuel available, reduce fuel usage on the deck, increase engine performance; and/or adjustments to subsystem integration and/or architecture or advanced flight controls,' it adds. NAVAIR's website puts the F/A-18E/F's maximum combat range at 1,275 nautical miles (2,346 kilometers), but with a loadout of just two AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. Boeing, the Super Hornet's manufacturer, has said in the past that the jet's range is around 1,188 nautical miles (2,200 kilometers) when carrying two AIM-9X Sidewinders, two AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM), two 2,000-pound-class precision-guided bombs, and a 480-gallon drop tank on the centerline station. The EA-18G's combat range when carrying three AN/ALQ-99 jamming pods, two AIM-120s, two radar-busting AGM-88-series missiles, and two 480-gallon drop tanks is over 850 nautical miles (1,574 kilometers), per NAVAIR. An EA-18G carrying three AN/ALQ-99 pods and a pair of drop tanks, as well as an Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation (ACMI) pod under its right wing. USN As already noted, Boeing has developed CFTs for the F/A-18E/F offering greater range and performance over loadouts using traditional draggy drop tanks. The two conformal tanks, designed to be installed on either side of the Super Hornet's spine on top of the jets’ center 'barrel' section, can hold 515 gallons of fuel in total. The company has previously said the tanks could extend the range of Super Hornet loaded with a pair of AIM-9Xs, a pair of AIM-120s, a pair of 2,000-pound precision-guided bombs, and the centerline drop tank, to 1,428 nautical miles (close to 2,645 kilometers). The CFTs could also free up the stations previously taken up by drop tanks for other stores. Boeing The Navy had originally planned to include the CFTs along with other improvements on new-production Block III Super Hornets and older jets brought up to that standard – an upgrade effort that is still underway. There had also been the potential for adding the CFTs to the EA-18Gs down the line. A Navy F/A-18F with conformal fuel tanks (CFT) installed during testing. USN However, in January 2021, the Navy halted work on the CFTs for the Super Hornet citing, in part, still largely unexplained technical hurdles tied in some way to carrier-based operations, as you can read more about here. Cost growth and delays were also a factor. It is certainly possible that the Navy could now revisit the matter of CFTs. At least new-production Block III Super Hornets all still have provisions for the ones Boeing has designed already. New, low-drag drop tanks might be another option. NAVAIR's mention of 'increase engine performance' as another possible avenue to increasing F/A-18E/F and EA-18G range recalls previous discussions about re-engining the jets. An Enhanced Performance Engine (EPE) configuration of the existing General Electric F414s that power Super Hornets and Growlers now has been proposed in the past. The F414-EPE was projected to offer a 20 percent increase in thrust (which could translate to greater range) and a one percent reduction in fuel burn rate. A look at the specifications of the previously proposed F414-EPE engine. General Electric How cost-effective and otherwise viable any other potential changes to the jet's physical structures, including the placement of subsystems, another potential range-extending avenue NAVAIR mentioned in its contracting notice today, might be is unclear. The Navy's existing Super Hornets have already been going through costly and time-consuming life-extension and upgrade programs in recent years. New-production jets are rolling off a line Boeing plans to shutter completely in 2027. At the same time, relatively small individual efficiency gains from more modest changes, such as vortex generators and drag-reducing techniques, coupled with improved computer-controlled flight systems and new tactics, techniques, and procedures, could all up when it comes to fuel economy and range. What is clear is that the Navy still has a significant interest in finding on-aircraft ways to extend the range of its F/A-18E/Fs and EA-18Gs. This comes amid an expanding air defense and anti-ship threat ecosystem that presents growing challenges to carrier-based aircraft and the ships in carrier strike groups. China's ever-more-capable arsenal of air-to-air, surface-to-air, and anti-ship missiles, as well as other anti-access and area-denial capabilities, is of particular concern to the U.S. military. This reality can only contribute to lengthening distances between where carriers will have to launch their aircraft to reduce vulnerability and where those planes are expected to operate. We have already seen this translate to significant aviation-related developments within the Navy, particularly the development and now fielding on at least a limited level of the AIM-174B air-launched derivative of the multi-purpose Standard Missile-6 (SM-6), which you can read more about here. F/A-18E/Fs are currently the only known launch platform for the notably large, heavy, and draggy AIM-174Bs, underscoring the value of new range-extending option, especially as alternatives to traditional drop tanks. Super Hornets are also set to be at least the initial launch platform for the Navy's Hypersonic Air-Launched Offensive Anti-Surface Warfare (HALO) hypersonic anti-ship cruise missile, another weapon that is expected to be relatively large. Heavier stores loadouts translate to increased fuel burn, as well as less margin for carrier-based aircraft to bring them back to the ship. There is also the matter of the Navy's work to introduce new infrared search and track (IRST) sensors in modified centerline drop tanks with reduced fuel capacity. IRSTs are an increasingly important capability for tactical jet fleets across the U.S. military. The Navy is also in the process of fielding a new family of next-generation electronic warfare pods for the EA-18G. GAO has reported in the past that Raytheon's ALQ-249(V)1 Next Generation Jammer-Mid Band (NGJ-MB) pods produce more drag than the existing AN/ALQ-99s and reduce range as a result. Weight and drag issues may also have contributed to the Navy's decision to choose an entirely separate design for the NGJ-Low Band (NGJ-LB) pod from L3Harris and Northrop Grumman rather than an NGJ-MB-derived proposal from Raytheon. A VAQ-133 Growler assigned to the USS Abraham Lincoln with AN/ALQ-249(V)1 Next Generation Jammer-Mid Band (NGJ-MB) pods under its wings. USN When it comes to extending the reach of its carrier air wings, the Navy is also still pursuing a fleet of uncrewed MQ-25 Stingray tankers, another Boeing product, to help increase the range of its carrier-based tactical jets. Core requirements for the Stingrays include the ability to offload at least 14,000 pounds of fuel (and potentially up to 16,000 pounds) up to 500 nautical miles (926 kilometers) away from the carrier. The MQ-25s will also have a secondary intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capability, and could take on other missions, including stand-off strike, in the future. At the same time, a series of delays have pushed back the timeline for the very first of the MQ-25s to begin entering operational service until at least 2026. Cost growth on the MQ-25 program also continues to be a major concern. As of August 2023, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), a Congressional watchdog, estimated the total Stingray program cost to be close to $15 billion, including the planned purchase of 76 drones. Past GAO estimates that also include associated construction work at various bases have put the program's expected price tag at around $16.5 billion. Just today, Boeing announced a $2 billion loss across various programs in its defense portfolio, including the MQ-25, during the third quarter of 2024. This was part of a nearly $6.2 billion loss for the entire company in the third quarter, adding to billions of dollars of already reported financial losses this year. Boeing's earnings report&#8230;$6.17b net loss in 3Q, $7.98b so far in FY. Beyond the $2b charges on KC-46, VC-25, T-7, MQ-25 and commercial crew, there's 'unfavorable performance on other programs.'&mdash; Brian Everstine (@beverstine) October 23, 2024 The aforementioned threat ecosystem means that fuel-hungry U.S. tactical jets will have to contend with how the evolving battlespace will limit access to traditional aerial refueling support, the capacity of which is expected to be strained by operational demands to begin with. This has put renewed emphasis on smaller tankers, crewed or uncrewed, such as C-130-based types, which could make use of a wider array of operating locations, as well as more novel capabilities. The Navy's carrier air wings are in an important transition period more broadly. The service plans to add a new F/A-XX sixth-generation crewed stealth combat jet and Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) loyal wingman-type drones to its carrier-based fleets in the coming years. The Navy has a now long-standing goal to have carrier air wings be sixty percent uncrewed in the future. Drones typically have greater range than their crewed tactical jet counterparts, and increasing the ratio of uncrewed platforms could also help extend the reach of carrier air wings by hundreds of miles. At the same time, Super Hornets and Growlers are expected to continue being workhorses of the Navy's carrier air wings for the foreseeable future. As such, finding ways to extend their reach to expand their operational flexibility and reduce vulnerability clearly remains of great interest, if not critical importance.

North Korean Troops In Russia Finally Confirmed By NATO, U.S.	After a week of saying they had no evidence of North Korean troops in Russia, officials at the White House, Pentagon and NATO have now gone on the record to say Pyongyang has indeed deployed a significant number of soldiers. 'We know that thousands of DPRK troops are in Russia to be trained,' a senior Biden administration official told The War Zone Wednesday morning. 'We don’t know what their mission will be or if they’ll go on to fight in Ukraine. But we do know that if they do this, it signals President Putin’s growing desperation in his war against Ukraine. Russia is suffering extraordinary casualties on the battlefield every day. If Russia needs to turn to DPRK for manpower, that’s a sign of desperation – not strength – on the part of the Kremlin.' Traveling with reporters in Rome, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin offered similar insights. 'Our analysts … continue to look at this,' he said, according to The Washington Post. 'Now we are seeing evidence that there are North Korean troops that have gone to … Russia.' Well that's a new one. Pilots of a Russian bomber left an appeal to the Ministry of Defence written on a glide bomb complaining about lack of bonus pay for bombing their own country:'Dear Ministry of Defence, I’m FAB with UMPK.Soon I will fly to destroy occupiers in Kursk Obl.… pic.twitter.com/dvK2O4ds6U&mdash; WarTranslated (Dmitri) (@wartranslated) October 22, 2024 While the head of Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR) told us that there are nearly 12.000 North Koreans in Russia training to fight Ukraine, Austin said the Pentagon has yet to determine how many and what they will do. 'What exactly they’re doing is left to be seen. But, yes, there is evidence that there are DPRK troops in Russia,' he added, using the abbreviation for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Asked about the intent of North Korea’s deployment, Austin said the United States is still trying to determine that. 'If they’re co-belligerents, if their intention is to participate in this war on Russia’s behalf, that is a very, very serious issue,' he said. 'It will have impacts, not only in Europe. It will also impact things in the Indo-Pacific as well.' In Brussels, NATO spokesperson Farah Dakhlallah also noted the presence of North Korean troops in Russia. 'Allies have confirmed evidence of a DPRK deployment to Russia,' she said, according to a tweet from Voice of America national security correspondent Jeff Selden. 'If these troops are destined to fight in Ukraine, it would ​ mark a significant escalation in North Korea's support for Russia's illegal war and yet another sign of Russia’s significant losses on the front line.' NATO is 'actively consulting within the alliance on this matter,' Dakhlallah added. 'The North Atlantic Council will receive a briefing from the ROK (South Korea) and further discuss this matter soon.' NEW: @NATO confirms #NorthKorea has troops in #Russia 'Allies have confirmed evidence of a #DPRK troop deployment to Russia' per @NATOpress spox Farah Dakhlallah&mdash; Jeff Seldin (@jseldin) October 23, 2024 We have been reporting for more than two weeks about the presence of North Korean troops deployed to Russia to bolster its fight against Ukraine. Yesterday, Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, head of GUR, told us that the first of those troops were expected to be on the battlefield in Kursk today. We have asked him for an update on that claim and will report any pertinent details he provides. While Budanov told us that there are nearly 12,000 North Korean troops in Russia, South Korean intelligence officials on Wednesday said there are about 3,000 at the moment with a total of 10,000 expected, the country’s Yonhap News Agency reported Wednesday. About 1,500 are elite special operations forces. 'After the first batch arrived in Russia from Oct. 8-13, an additional 1,500 soldiers have been sent there,' Rep. Park Sun-won of the main opposition Democratic Party told reporters, citing a report by National Intelligence Service (NIS) Director Cho Tae-yong. The troops have yet to arrive at the front and are instead stationed at military facilities in Russia where they are adjusting to their new circumstances, the publication reported. Last week we reported that the NIS released its assessment of the situation, which included satellite images purporting to show North Korean troops training in Russia's far east. However, the number of troops and if they are even North Korean cannot be confirmed by the satellite imagery provided. You can see one of those images below. A military facility in Ussuriisk, Primorsky Krai that South Korea’s spy agency says shows an estimated 400 North Korean personnel gathered on a parade ground. (NIS) 'The soldiers are undergoing special training on how to use military equipment and fly unmanned aerial vehicles, among other things,' Yonhap stated. A North Korean soldier receives around US $2,000 monthly for the service to Russia, NIS said. 'Russian instructors believe that North Korean soldiers are fit both physically and mentally, but they lack the understanding of modern warfare, such as drone attacks,' Yonhap reported. '‘They also expect multiple casualties among the North Koreans,’ the NIS was quoted as saying by the lawmaker.' At least six of Pyongyang’s forces, as we previously noted, have already been killed in Ukraine. All this comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin submitted a draft law to the Russian State Duma recently seeking ratification of a strategic partnership between Moscow and Pyongyang, hammered out in June. It calls for each side to provide military assistance to each other in the event of war. The exchange is not out of the goodness of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un’s heart. Moscow is providing him with nuclear weapons technology in return, Budanov told The Economist. 'Budanov describes the secret provisions of the agreement as a quid pro quo,' the publication reported. 'Russian hard cash and know-how in return for Korean men and missiles. Russia is helping North Korea circumvent sanctions and ‘strengthen’ its nuclear capabilities.' In particular, Budanov said Russia 'is transferring some technologies for low-yield tactical nuclear weapons and submarine missile-launch systems.' However, The Economist noted, 'there is no independent corroboration of this alarming claim.' More serious than troops: 'According to Mr Budanov, [North Korean] shipments that began as long ago as in late 2022 have reached 2.8m shells a year, just 100,000 short of Russia’s own annual production at 2.9m shells.' Shashank Joshi (@shashj) October 23, 2024 Officials at the White House, Pentagon and NATO have yet to say how they would respond if North Korean troops engage on a large scale in battles with Ukrainian forces. As we noted yesterday, U.S. officials, East Asian diplomats and congressional aides are saying there is not much the U.S. to stop North Korea from sending troops to Russia. 'They concede that Washington has made little to no progress in slowing North Korea’s rogue nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, and if it can’t do that, it can only do so much to halt North Korean troop deployments to Russia, too,' those sources told Politico. The presence of even 12,000 North Korean troops may not drastically alter the outcome of the fight even if about 1,500 of them are said to be elite special operations forces. However, with plenty more at his disposal, Kim could eventually increase the supply of troops to Russia dramatically.

EP-3E Aries II Spy Plane That Collided With Chinese Fighter Is Go...	The spy plane at the center of one of the most notorious post-Cold War air incidents, a U.S. Navy EP-3E Aries II, has arrived at the Pima Air & Space Museum in Tucson, Arizona, for future public display. The EP-3E’s journey to get to the museum has been a long one, starting with the dramatic collision with a Chinese fighter in the so-called Hainan Island incident in 2001. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Pima Air & Space Museum (@pimaair) EP-3E serial number 156511 was the aircraft involved in the collision. Confirmed by an Instagram post from the Pima Air & Space Museum, it arrived at the location yesterday, having been towed there from the boneyard at the nearby 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) in Tucson. The museum states that the Aries II is not yet ready for public display, but it will be a truly unique exhibit once that happens. EP-3E Aries II serial number 156511 is towed to the Pima Air &#038; Space Museum yesterday. Pima Air &#038; Space Museum Pima Air &#038; Space Museum Even without the turbulent history of this particular airframe, the EP-3E — one of America’s most sensitive intelligence-gathering assets — is already an impressively rare aircraft to see in the flesh. A derivative of the P-3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft, the EP-3E has a critical important intelligence-gathering role and is optimized for the maritime/littoral domain. The aircraft is equipped to gather real-time tactical signals intelligence, including intercepting communications and locating and classifying emitters, including those related to integrated air defense systems. On April 1, 2001, serial number 156511 was flying a routine reconnaissance mission over the South China Sea out of Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, Japan. As well as six flight crew, it carried a reconnaissance crew of 18, from the Navy, Marines, and Air Force. It was assigned to Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron One (VQ-1), known as the 'World Watchers.' The cabin of EP-3E Aries II serial number 156511 as it appears now. Pima Air &#038; Space Museum Tasked with monitoring Chinese communications as well radio-frequency signals emitted by radars and weapon systems, the EP-3E was flying at 22,500 feet off Hong Kong’s coast in international airspace, when the crew was alerted to the fact that interceptors had been launched from Lingshui air base on Hainan Island, China. Within minutes, a pair of People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) J-8D Finback interceptors appeared about a mile away. This was the signal for the EP-3E crew to turn around from its mission and prepare to head back to base. The Chinese J-8 flown by Wang Wei on April 1, 2001, flies close to another U.S. Navy aircraft on a different occasion. U.S. Navy Next, however, one of the J-8s approached from the rear left and took up station just 10 feet away from the EP-3E’s wing. The Chinese pilot, Wang Wei, saluted the American crew, then dropped back 100 feet. Assigned to the 9th Naval Division, Wei was already well known to U.S. reconnaissance crews, on account of his aggressive approaches to spy planes. This kind of behavior included buzzing at high speed as well as cutting in front of and across the path of the reconnaissance aircraft — also known as a ‘headbutting’ maneuver. '[Wei] was extra crazy. He would get so close to the plane that you could literally jump from one wingtip to another wingtip,' one of the EP-3E crew members later told The Intercept. On one previous occasion, Wang had got close enough to show a piece of paper with his email address to the U.S. crew, who were able to photograph it. A U.S. Navy EP-3E Aries II spy plane. U.S. Navy Despite complaints made to Beijing, these kinds of intercepts had continued, China claiming it was well within its right to defend what it saw as its sovereign airspace. On this occasion, Wei approached the EP-3E for a second time, coming within five feet of the spy plane, mouthed something to the crew, and then fell back again. On his third approach, Wei got too close to the EP-3E. Hit jet was apparently sucked into the slipstream and was sliced in two by one of the propellers. He reportedly ejected but was killed. As the Chinese fighter was torn in half, debris impacted the EP-3E, cutting through the fuselage and damaging the radome, two of the propellers, and an engine. The EP-3E rolled inverted as the crew battled with rapid depressurization. It then dropped like a stone some 14,000 feet, vibrating violently the whole time. The EP-3E pilot, Lt. Shane Osborn, wrestled with the controls and ordered the crew to prepare to bail out. Osborn considered putting the aircraft down in the sea but then reconsidered, deciding on a recovery at Lingshui air base — around 20 minutes away. With no working flaps, the aircraft too heavy, and also falling apart, this seemed like the only option. The flight deck of the EP-3E involved in the Hainan Incident, as it appears now. Pima Air &#038; Space Museum Amid the chaos, the crew made frantic attempts to destroy as much of the highly sensitive equipment and materials on board the spy plane as they could. Unfortunately, only one member of the crew had ever taken part in an inflight emergency destruction drill, so there was little understanding as to what needed to be done to keep secrets out of Chinese hands. An emergency ax was available but proved to be too blunt to do real damage to equipment and there was no shredder, so documents had to be torn up by hand. Cassette tapes full of intercepted data were unspooled by hand. 'I was bashing in computer screens. People were ripping wires out of the wall,' the same crew member told The Intercept. 'By the time we landed, the plane was in total disrepair. We had screwed up the inside of that plane as much as we could.'

Although the EP-3E hadn’t been upgraded to the latest standard, it was still an intelligence windfall for the Chinese. The United States later assessed that it was 'highly probable' that China had obtained classified information from the aircraft. A total of 16 cryptographic keys, other codebooks and laptops, and a computer used for signals intelligence processing, were all still intact. Tuners and processors for signals collection equipment were also mainly undamaged, as were cryptographic voice and data devices for communication and data transfer between the EP-3E and Kadena. On arrival at Lingshui, the EP-3E was met by Chinese military trucks, which guided it to the end of the runway where soldiers surrounded it.

U.S. Air Force The crew were held for 11 days before being released and were regularly interrogated. Meanwhile, the United States secured the return of the EP-3E, which China said had to be dismantled first. This was done with the help of Lockheed Martin technicians. The spy plane was then flown back to the Marietta, Georgia, aboard two Antonov An-124 transports. The spy plane was reassembled and repaired, adding parts from an NP-3D and the wings of a retired P-3B. It made its first flight after the rebuild on November 15, 2002, and then underwent maintenance and modernization with L3 in Waco, Texas, before being returned to service. It was still active as of September 2020, when it was photographed over the East China Sea, and was reportedly still in service as of April this year. Lt.

So far, there has not been another incident as serious as that of April 1, 2001, but there have been close calls. In October of last year, the Pentagon accused the pilot of a Chinese J-11 fighter of conducting an 'unsafe intercept' of a .S. Air Force B-52H Stratofortress bomber over the highly contested South China Sea. You can read more about that incident here. Earlier the same month, the Department of Defense released a collection of declassified images and videos that it says provide evidence of 'a dangerous pattern of coercive and risky operational behavior by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) against U.S. aircraft operating lawfully in international airspace in the East and South China Sea.' The Pentagon said that there were more than 180 such interactions between the fall of 2021 and October 2023. In one of those incidents, in May 2023, a J-16 fighter 'flew directly in front of the nose' of a U.S. Air Force RC-135 surveillance aircraft, forcing it to fly through its wake turbulence — an action known as ‘headbutting’ or ‘thumping.’ Other examples include a simulated attack on a U.S. Navy task group and a close-proximity intercept of another RC-135 by a J-11 — as seen in the video below — both in December 2022. More worrying was the incident in June 2022, when a Royal Australian Air Force P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft was reportedly damaged by countermeasures launched by a Chinese J-16, once again over the South China Sea. As the Hainan Island demonstrates, the stakes have long been very high in these interactions over the South China Sea, especially since Beijing claims the vast majority of these waters as its own. As of today, the EP-3E remains very much still involved in intelligence-gathering missions here and around other global hotspots. At one point, it seemed likely the last of these spy planes would cease operations by September 30, 2024, with the deactivation of VP-1 scheduled to follow in March 2025. However, operational demands have postponed this for the time being. Ultimately, however, the EP-3E’s days are now numbered with the MQ-4C Triton drone steadily replacing it. A U.S. Navy MQ-4C Triton. U.S. Navy Under the Admiral's ambitious plan, everything will feed into a deconflicted and refined common battlespace picture, from high-end ISR assets like this MQ-4C Triton to a swarm of unmanned surface vessels to space-based sensing and even data collected by sensors that are forward-deployed by small ground units. The distributed nature of battlefield data collection will be critical to winning a future fight, but parsing and fuzing all of it and transferring it around a vast battlefield will be major hurdles. (USN) While the events of April 1, 2001, could have ended much worse for the crew of the EP-3E, it’s highly appropriate that such a historic aircraft be preserved for public view. Not only does it stand testimony to the particular events of that day, but it also serves as a reminder of the constant risk that aerial reconnaissance crews are exposed to on missions of this kind.

German P-8s To Fly From U.K. To Help Counter Russian Submarine Th...	Under a major new defense agreement, the United Kingdom and Germany will work together on a raft of programs including new drones, missile defenses, and deep-strike weapons, as well as the periodic deployment of the German Navy’s P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft to a base in Scotland. The Trinity House Agreement will also see significant cooperation on the industrial level, including artillery and armored vehicles. Taken together, the agreement is squarely aimed at better equipping the two countries to deter and defend against Russian belligerence in Europe. NEWS: Today, the United Kingdom and Germany will sign a landmark agreement that will bring our two nations’ Armed Forces closer together than ever. What this deal will deliver &mdash; Ministry of Defence (@DefenceHQ) October 23, 2024 The first-of-its-kind agreement was signed in London today by U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey and his German counterpart Boris Pistorius. 'The signing of the Trinity House Agreement marks a fundamental shift in the U.K.’s relations with Germany and for European security,' the U.K. government said in a statement. 'This agreement between Europe’s two biggest defense spenders will strengthen national security and economic growth in the face of growing Russian aggression and increasing threats.' Anti-submarine warfare Surprisingly, in the United Kingdom, the most attention has so far been devoted to the agreement’s plan for German aircraft to operate from Scotland. Possibly starting as early as next year, the German Navy’s P-8 maritime patrol aircraft will 'periodically operate' out of RAF Lossiemouth, supporting the resident U.K. Royal Air Force Poseidon fleet of nine aircraft. Germany has eight P-8s on order. A U.K. Royal Air Force P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft, seen here flying over the coast of Scotland. Crown Copyright Cpl Adam Fletcher The Times of London described the P-8s as 'German spy aircraft,' although these are multi-mission platforms that are primarily tasked with protecting the Baltic Sea and the North Atlantic against potential Russian aggression and tracking Russian submarine activity, which has been a growing area of concern for some time now. Responding to some of the more hyperbolic reports about the deployment, RAF Lossiemouth posted the following meme on X: pic.twitter.com/kKqd01kVnW&mdash; RAF Lossiemouth (@RAFLossiemouth) October 23, 2024 Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, the head of the U.K. Armed Forces, warned last year of a 'phenomenal increase in Russian submarine and underwater activity' over the past two decades. A reference in the statement from the U.K. government to 'Sting Ray torpedoes procurement' also suggests that, in the future, the German P-8s might also be armed with these British-made anti-submarine weapons. The United Kingdom announced last year that it would arm its P-8s with the Sting Ray alongside the continued use of the U.S.-made Mk 54 torpedo.

Crown Copyright LA(Phot) Dan Rosenbaum Previously, the United Kingdom and Norway discussed plans to cooperate on P-8 operations, and adding Germany to this group would provide a further boost to NATO’s ability to effectively patrol the North Atlantic, including the strategically vital Greenland, Iceland, United Kingdom Gap, better known as the GIUK Gap. This is a critical bottleneck that is closely monitored. If Russian submarines can sneak through undetected, they have a much better chance of disappearing into the Atlantic without being traced. During a full-blown conflict, this would likely include wreaking havoc on NATO shipping and naval flotillas and executing pinpoint attacks on key land targets. Dating from the Cold War but still relevant today, a map of the GIUK Gap. CIA.gov Given the two countries’ histories, having German aircraft based in the United Kingdom might be eye-catching, but it may well not be the most significant part of the agreement. Artillery and armor On the industrial side, a new artillery gun barrel factory will be set up in the United Kingdom, producing large-caliber barrels on behalf of the German Rheinmetall concern. This is a major development for the United Kingdom, which has not built artillery gun barrels for around 20 years. Sheffield Forgemasters, which will build the gun barrels in the United Kingdom, confirmed that these would be for U.K. defense contracts and export orders. Reports suggest that the barrels to be manufactured will be for the British Army’s forthcoming Challenger 3 main battle tank, which is armed with a new 120mm L55A1 smoothbore cannon, and the Boxer RCH 155, a wheeled self-propelled howitzer developed in Germany and armed with a 155mm gun, which has been selected for the U.K. Mobile Fires Platform program. Rheinmetall making barrels for Challenger 3 and Boxer RCH155 in the UK is the best possible news for our national property agenda, strategic resilience, and increasing UK content for locally produced military equipment.

A Boxer RCH 155 self-propelled howitzer. Crown Copyright Jack Eckersley Meanwhile, the agreement also includes a long-term commitment to manufacturing Boxer armored vehicles in the United Kingdom. In 2019, the British Army ordered 523 Boxer vehicles in four build configurations, covering 11 different roles, and a follow-on order for 100 of these vehicles was placed later. The Boxer is also used by Germany and has been exported to Australia, Lithuania, and the Netherlands. Long-range strike More intriguing yet is the agreement’s commitment to the joint development of a host of novel weapons and capabilities, covering air, land, sea, space, and cyber domains. The two countries will work together to 'rapidly develop' new extended deep strike weapons. No more details were provided, but the weapon or weapons will be expected to fly further and attack targets with greater precision than the Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missile used by the U.K. Royal Air Force and others. A Storm Shadow missile under the wing of a U.K. Royal Air Force Typhoon fighter. Crown Copyright Crown Copyright Previous reports suggested that the United Kingdom was looking at a strike weapon that would have a range of about 2,000 miles, which would allow it to reach Moscow after a launch from eastern Germany. The weapon was said to be a deterrent to Russian tactical nuclear missiles, which are being fielded in increasingly advanced and long-reaching forms, including in Kaliningrad, the Russian exclave on the Baltic Sea. This is an extension of the agreement from the NATO Defense Ministers meeting in Brussels last week. On the sidelines of that meeting, the United Kingdom announced it was joining the European Long-Range Strike Approach (ELSA) initiative, a French-led effort that involves Germany, Poland, and Italy. Previous announcements state that ELSA envisages a missile with a range of between 1,000 and 2,000 kilometers (621 and 1,243 miles) — significantly less than what is reportedly now proposed for the U.K.-German program — and that it should be in service by the 2030s. The UK has agreed to take part in the European Long-range Strike Approach (ELSA). Not unexpected given earlier signals from German-UK meetings in July.

Missile defense Long-range strike is very much an area of interest in Europe right now, as is air defense, especially against missile threats. The Anglo-German agreement includes a pledge to work jointly with undisclosed partners to integrate air defense systems 'to better protect European airspace against the threat of long-range missiles.' The joint air defense efforts may well end up building upon the European Sky Shield Initiative (ESSI), an agreement signed in 2022 by defense ministers from 14 NATO countries and Finland (now also an alliance member). Spearheaded by Germany and also including the United Kingdom, ESSI plans to form a common air defense procurement and deployment alliance, as you can read about here. The specific reference today to 'the threat of long-range missiles' is interesting, although it’s unclear if these are ballistic missiles — of the kind that Germany’s Arrow 3 procurement aims to counter — or cruise missiles, or both. Drone programs Although details are scarce, the agreement references different drone programs that the United Kingdom and Germany will pursue together. One of these involves new uncrewed air systems 'that could operate alongside our fighter jets, as well as drones that can be used by other military force[s].' Concepts for drones that can operate collaboratively with crewed fighters have already been gaining traction in Europe. In Germany, Airbus unveiled its fighter-like stealthy Wingman uncrewed concept aircraft this summer. This is also intended to fly collaborative missions alongside crewed fighters and is being pitched as a low-cost solution — with a price tag equivalent to one-third that of a modern crewed fighter — that can be brought into production and fielded rapidly. The Airbus Wingman concept aircraft broke cover this summer when it was formally unveiled at the ILA Berlin aerospace show. Thomas Newdick Thomas Newdick Airbus has said that the Luftwaffe or German Air Force has 'expressed a clear need' for a drone in this class and it might also feed into any related collaboration between the United Kingdom and Germany. The U.K. Royal Air Force has its own drone initiative known as the Lightweight Affordable Novel Combat Aircraft (LANCA) program, which is looking into a range of future kinds of drones. At one stage, this included Project Mosquito, which planned to test a ‘loyal wingman’-type drone capable of working together semi-autonomously with manned aircraft, but this was canceled in 2022. More recently, British attention has turned to drones that combine high performance with a low enough cost that commanders will consider them 'disposable' — meaning they are willing to sacrifice them in contested environments. One such concept is the Jackdaw, proposed by QinetiQ, the U.K. defense technology company, which was announced last year. It envisages a drone able to fly autonomously alongside crewed aircraft, as well as operate in swarms. A screencap from a video depicts multiple Jackdaw drones taking off from mobile launchers. QinetiQ Clearly, there are common interests between the two countries in this space, and with programs still in their infancy, collaboration could well help push these efforts forward. In the naval domain, the two countries will explore and develop new maritime uncrewed air system capabilities. This may involve Proteus, the helicopter drone developed by Leonardo in the United Kingdom under the Rotary Wing Uncrewed Air System (RWUAS) Technology Demonstration Program (TDP), or RWUAS CCD Phase 3 TDP. Plans call for a Proteus flying demonstrator to take to the air next year and a production version is planned to provide anti-submarine warfare support as part of the Royal Navy’s Future Maritime Aviation Force (FMAF). A rotary-wing drone may well be of interest to Germany, too. The German Navy planned to buy Swedish-made UMS Skeldar V-200 helicopter drones, for use on its Braunschweig class corvettes, but the project was canceled since the drones reportedly failed to meet requirements. Three of the K130 Braunschweig class corvettes in the Baltic Sea, during an exercise in May 2023. Bundeswehr/Nico Theska There is also mention of 'kickstarting collaboration of land-based drones,' suggesting collaboration on uncrewed ground vehicles. Military cooperation On a military level, the agreement lays out new cooperation to strengthen NATO’s eastern flank, which will see the armed forces of the United Kingdom and Germany 'training and exercising more together, using the front as a catalyst for developing new ways of fighting.' In the North Sea, meanwhile, in addition to the P-8 cooperation, the United Kingdom and Germany aim to work together to protect critical underwater infrastructure, specifically the vital cables and gas pipelines that run along the seabed. 'This includes exploring new offboard undersea surveillance capabilities to improve detection of adversary activity,' the U.K. government says. Admiral Radakin previously raised worries over the security of undersea cables and there have been a number of incidents involving sabotage or apparent sabotage to this critical infrastructure, with the finger of blame more often than not pointed at the Kremlin. Ukraine The one reference in the agreement that relates to the support of Ukraine in its war with Russia involves 'new joint work to enable German Sea King helicopters to be armed with modern missile systems as well as work on capability coalitions.' Eastern Ukraine, a pair of British-supplied Westland Sea King HU.5 helicopters in Ukrainian Naval Aviation service operate from a forward airstrip. pic.twitter.com/s6DnBwmSxN&mdash; OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) July 8, 2024 This suggests that the six Sea King helicopters being donated by Germany to Ukraine will first be armed with some kind of offensive missile capability, with that work perhaps being carried out in the United Kingdom, or at least with British support. German Navy Sea Kings were previously armed with Sea Skua anti-ship missiles, but these weapons were withdrawn long before the helicopters were retired in August of this year. The United Kingdom was the original manufacturer of those helicopters, and it has already provided surplus Sea Kings to Ukraine (although not, as far as is known, armed with missile systems). Overall, while details about the specifics of the program included in the agreement are still scarce, the Trinity House Agreement is a significant development. On the one hand, it brings military and industrial cooperation between the United Kingdom and Germany to a new level. More broadly, it demonstrates the two countries’ willingness to increase defense capabilities within NATO, with the specific aim of facing off the threat from Russia. German and British soldiers during a joint operation at the Neman River during the Saber Strike 2018 military exercises in Zapyskis, Lithuania. Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images Sean Gallup 'We must not take security in Europe for granted,' German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said. 'Russia is waging war against Ukraine, it is increasing its weapons production immensely and has repeatedly launched hybrid attacks on our partners in Eastern Europe.' Pistorius also stated that the various cooperation projects outlined in the agreement are 'open to other partners.' Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has highlighted critical capability gaps in NATO in Europe, as well as shone a light on the potential vulnerability of the alliance’s eastern flank to Russian aggression. With that in mind, today’s agreement is a clear signal that the United Kingdom and Germany see military cooperation as a prerequisite for strengthening NATO in Europe.

The Existence Of Israel’s Secret Stealth Drone Should Come As No ...	The existence of a secret Israeli drone, referred to as RA-01 and used for covert missions, has emerged from an unauthorized disclosure of U.S. intelligence documents which have now been posted all over social media. Israel's possession of at least a pocket fleet of long-range stealth drones capable of gathering intelligence and possibly conducting strikes is extremely logical to the point of it being a bit odd if they never pursued such a capability. Israel is home to an extensive and often pioneering uncrewed aviation industry and drones of this kind would be very well suited to supporting the country's ongoing stand-off with Iran. During a major Israeli operation to strike targets in that country, they would likely play an indispensable role, as well. Mention of RA-01 is found in classified documents from the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), the authenticity of which U.S. officials have not disputed and that first emerged online last week via a pro-Iran channel on the Telegram social network. An investigation into whether this unapproved release was the product of a hack or a leak is ongoing. The documents could still be disinformation or feature inaccurate info by design, so we cannot indepedently confirm their authenticity, but at this time, there is no indication that they are not legitimate and there are many indications that they are. it seems that CNN is considering some leaked documents about Israeli preparation to attack Iran as authentic for me is that apart from the 'RA-01' drone a ALBM named 'Golden Horizon' is mentioned.The ALBM 'Rocks' was known for some time pic.twitter.com/kovQqDU5W5&mdash; ben-reuter (@benreuter_IMINT) October 20, 2024 The NGA documents center on observations from October 15-16 of an Israeli Air Force (IAF) large force exercise, which is viewed as part of preparations for retaliation primarily for Iran's ballistic missile barrage at the beginning of this month. In addition to talk about RA-01, there is a discussion about Israel's air-launched ballistic missile capabilities, including Rocks and the previously undisclosed Golden Horizon, which have been employed in previous Israeli retaliatory strikes on Iran, as you can read more about here. There is also talk of Israel's nuclear arsenal, which the country has never publicly acknowledged, and that NGA does not expect to be used in any near-term operations against Iran, as well. When it comes to the RA-01, no details are provided about its design or capabilities, or the size of the fleet, in the NGA documents. What significance the RA-01 nomenclature might have is unknown. 'RA' could imply a reconnaissance and attack capability. Its basic structure is also in line with alpha-numeric designations Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI) has used for drone designs in the past. The designation could be one the U.S. Intelligence Community uses internally to refer to this platform and that does not reflect in any way what the Israelis call it, as well. One of the NGA documents also refers to the Rocks air-launched ballistic missile as the IS02, which could also be another internal U.S. designation. The only known picture of the Rocks air-launched ballistic missile, under the wing of an IAF F-16I wearing a rare gray scheme. IAF NGA's report also does not say any RA-01s were actually observed, just that there were signs that they were operating during the period in question from a restricted area at Ramon Airbase in the Negev desert in southern Israel. Ramon, which was among the targets of Iran's missile and drone attacks on Israel back in April, primarily hosts F-16I Sufa fighters and AH-64 attack helicopters, but has also been home to various secretive and specialized units over the years. Experts and observers have already identified a pair of secluded fence-off areas at the northeastern end of Ramon with shared direct access to one of the base's two runways, which could house the RA-01s. Now that the authenticity of these documents has been confirmed, there’s a critical detail that demands attention:'The Israeli Air Force (IAF) continued covert UAV operations from 15 through 16 October. According to imagery analysis, Israel’s covert UAVs enable long-range,… pic.twitter.com/ycgSFHOuzg&mdash; Clash Report (@clashreport) October 20, 2024 Work on this segregated area of the base dates back to at least the 2007-2008 timeframe from what can seen in available satellite imagery. A significant redevelopment and expansion of this section, including the construction of an entirely new taxiway, more hangars, and other facilities, occurred in the mid-2010s. A satellite image of the segregated area of Ramon Airbase taken in 2010, which offers a good view of its original layout. Google Earth Another satellite image taken in August 2023 showing the revamped and expanded look of the segregated area at Ramon Airbase, which is largely as it still appears today. Google Earth A general look at Ramon Airbase in Israel in 2023. Google Earth Each of the current fenced-off areas has a pair of semi-circular hangars that are approximately 80 feet long and 64 feet wide. One of the sections also has a rectangular hangar, which dates back to the original construction in this part of the base, and that is some 120 feet long and 60 feet wide. Both areas have 70-foot by 70-foot open-ended sunshade-style enclosures leading to the shared taxiway, which is just over 70 feet wide. This might point to the maximum length of the RA-01's wingspan. White triangles painted on the tarmac extending to one side of both of the sunshades look to be engine backblast warning areas, which could point to jet propulsion. This also points to these structures being scoot-and-hide shelters where ground personnel can load munitions and other stores, as well as conduct various other kinds of last-minute checks, away from prying eyes, including satellites above. A closer look at the hangars, sunshades, tarmac markings, and other features at the segregated section of Ramon Airbase as of August 2023. Google Earth The presence of two distinct fenced-off areas may also point to one or more other secretive drone types being housed in this part of Ramon Airbase beyond the RA-01s. This, in turn, could mean the hangar and taxiway dimensions, as well as the triangles on the tarmac, and not reflective of the RA-01's design, at least exclusively. Hangars can be used to hold multiple assets at once, too. The possibility remains that the RA-01s operate from elsewhere within the base, as well, and these facilities are used for other platforms entirely. It is worth noting in this context that U.S. drones designed for covert and clandestine missions, including ones deep inside denied areas, dating back to the height of the Cold War and that have now emerged into the light, range widely in size, complexity and configuration. Prominent examples of this diversity of designs (and specific intended mission profiles) include the stealthy flying wing RQ-170 Sentinel and the RQ-29, a converted civilian light sport aircraft. As noted earlier, Israel's aerospace sector has an established history of pioneering uncrewed aviation developments. Furthermore, though Israeli companies have not publicly demonstrated a flying stealth aircraft, crewed or uncrewed, it should be within their technical grasp. IAI, specifically, is known to have reached at least the wind tunnel testing phase of development on one high-altitude long-endurance drone concept with radar and infrared signature-reducing features, called the HA-10, in the 1990s. The HA-10 has been linked to the Israeli Boost Intercept System (IBIS) missile defense project, which envisioned a missile-armed drone to shoot down enemy ballistic missiles in their initial boost phase of flight. 'The UAV [uncrewed air vehicle] would have cruised at between 7 and 15 km [approximately 23,000 to 49,000 feet] altitude, and would carry an IRST [infrared search and track system], laser range-finder, datalinks and two to four [Python-series air-to-air] missiles,' according to an archived digital edition of Jane's Strategic Weapon Systems from 2002. 'HA-10 was designed with low IR and radar signatures, and was planned to loiter for up to 24 hours on station with a payload of 1,000 kg [approximately 2,200 pounds].' A rendering of the HA-10 design. IAI A paper that members of IAI presented at the 24th International Congress of the Aeronautical Sciences in 2004 describes the HA-10 as one of 'a number of additional high altitude advanced configurations' the company had previously examined 'within the framework of the advanced design activity.' IAI's 'HA' series does also include another non-stealthy design, the HA-13, that the company proposed together with TRW in the United States to meet the U.S. Air Force's Tier II+ drone requirements that ultimately led to the fielding of the Global Hawk. The possibility that the RA-01 is close in form and/or function to something like the HA-10 or the RQ-170, or even to a flying wing UCAV, would align well with the other details about the large force IAF exercise, as well as Israel's general operational considerations, especially with regard to Iran. Though the current Iranian regime is prone to sometimes absurd hyperbole, it has air defense capabilities that present real threats. Iran's shootdown of a U.S. Navy RQ-4 drone over the Strait of Hormuz in 2019 prompted notable discussions about the survivability of non-stealthy uncrewed aircraft in future conflicts that have had clear impacts on subsequent U.S. military planning. The RQ-170 has also notably been sent over Iran in the past, with authorities there recovering a largely intact example that went down inside the country in 2011. The RQ-170 Sentinel Iran recovered in 2011 on display. Iranian State Media It is also interesting to note here that initial work on the segregated section at Ramon airbase in the late 2000s came at a time when concerns about Iran getting more capable S-300 surface-to-air missile systems from Russia were growing. Those same concerns reportedly helped drive the IAF's decision to purchase F-35 stealth fighters. Iran also finally sealed the deal to acquire S-300s around the time that the work was being done to revamp and expand the fenced-off areas of Ramon. The construction of the initial segregated portion of Ramon also came around the time, broadly speaking, of Israel's covert 2007 strike on a secret nuclear reactor in Syria that Bashar Al Assad's regime had built with help from North Korea. F-16Is from Ramon were among the aircraft involved in that operation. The Syrian armed forces also have an air defense network that presents real threats, as exemplified by the shootdown of an Israeli F-16 in 2018. Watch how the IAF destroyed the Syrian nuclear facility in 2007 pic.twitter.com/HQqRd4xnba&mdash; Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) March 21, 2018 Other incidents over the years, including strikes against Iranian-backed militias in Iraq in 2019, have raised questions about possible secret Israeli drone capabilities. Advanced uncrewed aircraft operated by Israel and others might also, in part, help explain claimed incidents involving unexplained aerial objects over Iran in recent decades, which also often come with reports of heavy electronic attacks on perusing fighters and radar stations. Overall, for Israel, with its long and still expanding history of very long range and often covert and/or clandestine strikes on high-value targets in foreign countries, a drone just having the ability to persistently surveil far-flung and denied areas would be of great value. Stealthy uncrewed aircraft capable of conducting intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions could also provide important pre and post-strike intelligence. A penetrating uncrewed ISR platform could also help provide early warning about potential threats and otherwise monitor areas of interest, all with a lower chance of an opponent like Iran even detecting their presence. As The War Zone has highlighted in the past, persistent surveillance that can help establish so-called 'patterns of life' in a target area from which various kinds of useful intelligence can be gleaned. Doing this while deep in denied airspace without the enemy even knowing they are being watched can result in much higher-fidelity intelligence products. As relevant examples, the RQ-170 reportedly helped keep tabs on Osama Bin Laden's compound in Pakistan before and during the U.S. raid that led to his death and the U.S. Air Force has at least explored using the Sentinel to help with bomb damage assessment. In the latter case, a test was conducted involving an RQ-170 assessing the impact of a GBU-57/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) bunker buster, a weapon specifically designed to be employed against deeply buried facilities like those housing much of Iran's nuclear infrastructure. An RQ-170 at Andersen Air Force Base on Guam. USAF There is also a question to be raised here about whether Israel might be a partner of some kind when it comes to the RQ-170 and/or related developments. The Sentinel has had its own role in keeping tabs on Iranian, North Korean, and Pakistani nuclear and ballistic missile programs. A true stealthy UCAV capable of prosecuting long-range kinetic strikes or launching non-kinetic attacks (such as electronic or cyber warfare ones) would give Israel further options for targeting high-value assets and penetrating into densely defended areas to get to them, as well as doing so in covert and clandestine ways. Even just having the ability to deliver a small munition for a 'hammer toss' against a singular high-value target would be a major capability for a platform of this kind. In addition, UCAVs typically have combat radii that are multiple times greater than that of a fighter. For Israel, this could enable them to conduct entire missions into Iran and back without any need to refuel in mid-air. The IAF has notably limited aerial refueling capabilities to support long-range penetrating missions by its known crewed combat aircraft fleets. Israel does also have means of conducting long-range stand-off strikes, including with air-launched ballistic missiles like Rocks. Footage From the Refueling Aircraft on the Way to Strike Houthi Military Targets in YemenThe Israeli Air Force's refueling aircraft have been operating in all arenas in the war, providing fighter jets with flexibility in strikes and aerial operations at any distance.Yesterday… pic.twitter.com/o8TRNAtC8l&mdash; Israeli Air Force (@IAFsite) September 30, 2024 The War Zone has reported in detail in the past how there is evidence of the U.S. military and/or the U.S. Intelligence maintaining a pocket fleet of stealthy General Atomics Avenger drones for the same kinds of reasons. In many ways, it is surprising that evidence like this that could point to an Israeli force of stealthy drones, and possibly UCAVs, has not emerged before now. The absence of such a capability within the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) would be equally curious in much the same way that it is odd that the U.S. military has abandoned interest, at least publicly, in stealthy flying wing UCAVs. The continues to be substantial work on developing and fielding UCAVs elsewhere in the world, from France to Turkey to Russia to India. China has made especially significant strides in this field in recent years. So, while these documents certainly do offer some insights into what was previously an unconfirmed capability, their contents should be of little surprise.

Boeing’s 757 ‘Catfish’ Flying F-22 Avionics Testbed Emerges With ...	As if it didn’t have a distinctive enough look already, Boeing’s 757 Flying Test Bed — better known as ‘The Catfish’ due to its unique and highly modified nose profile — has got some striking new colors. The red, white, and blue scheme is a direct reference to the livery this very same aircraft originally wore, as the prototype for the 757 family. Aviation photographer @Task_Force23 has shared with us photos of the repainted Catfish, N757A, Boeing's first 757 that made its maiden flight on February 19, 1982.

The Catfish at Baltimore/Washington International Airport, Maryland, in February 2005. Sunil Gupta/Wikimedia Commons It’s not clear exactly why the jet’s original colors were reinstated at this point, but they certainly make N757A look even more striking. One possibility is to mark 25 years in service as a vital testbed used to perfect the F-22’s ever-evolving avionics suite. The Catfish’s current job in support of the F-22’s sensor suite is reflected in the Raptor nose grafted onto the forward fuselage, containing the AN/APG-77 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar. A swept-wing section atop the flight deck houses conformal antennas for the Raptor’s AN/ALR-94 electronic support measures suite. Less obvious is the Catfish’s use as a test platform for the F-22’s electronic warfare suite, low probability of intercept datalink, AN/AAR-56 IR/UV missile approach warning system, secure communications systems, and various other tactical subsystems. Inside the cabin of the 757 are computer workstations, server racks, and even a replica of the F-22 cockpit, with primary and secondary displays, as well as a throttle and stick, providing the highest level of realism for testing, including recreating the kinds of tactical and environmental scenarios that F-22 pilots would be exposed to in real life. Altogether, there is room on the aircraft for up to 30 software engineers and technicians to evaluate the avionics during testing.

James Richardson A U.S. Air Force F-22 Raptor from Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, flies in formation over the Joint Pacific Alaska Range Complex, July 18, 2019. The JPARC is a 67,000 plus square mile area, providing a realistic training environment commanders leverage for full spectrum engagements, ranging from individual skills to complex, large-scale joint engagements. (U.S. Air Force photo by Staff Sgt. James Richardson) While production of the F-22 was wrapped up back in 2011, it is still the U.S. Air Force’s premier air dominance fighter, and its sensor suite remains incredibly powerful. Continued trials involving the Catfish ensure that the Raptor remains on top of its game. This is primarily effected through incremental upgrades to the fighter’s hardware and software, most of which have been aided by the Catfish, which also plays a smaller role in the development of new tactics. As well as its usual home on the secure military ramp at Boeing Field, Seattle, the Catfish periodically deploys to Edwards Air Force Base, California, or Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, for development work, as well as taking part in major test events and exercises. For cross-platform integration, it has also been flown alongside other integrated testbeds, including the F-35’s Cooperative Avionics Testbed — nicknamed the CATbird — and additional platforms used by Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, and others. Under the Air Force’s Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program, the Catfish is almost certainly playing an active role in the development of the F-22’s successor. With the F-22 now being used as something of a test surrogate for technologies that are being developed under NGAD, as well as adopting technologies that have been designed for NGAD, the 757 Flying Test Bed will be feeding into both those programs. While there’s a long tradition of using surrogate aircraft as avionics testbeds, it’s interesting that the Catfish in particular seems to have influenced at least one similar platform operated by one of America’s major military rivals. In China, a specially adapted Russian-made Tupolev Tu-204C — itself essentially a clone of the 757 — is used for avionics testing. As you can read about here, this aircraft is being used as a flying integrated avionics testbed for the J-20 stealth fighter, Beijing’s closest answer to the F-22. The Chinese answer to the Catfish, based on a Tu-204C, with a J-20 nose and swept-wing section atop the flight deck, as found on the original 757 Flying Test Bed. via X There have been growing questions about the long-term future of the F-22 in recent years. However, in July of this year, the head of Air Combat Command said there is now no planned replacement for its Raptor fleet.

South Korea Could Send Advisors, Weapons To Ukraine Over North Ko...	The first North Korean troops are expected to arrive in Russia’s Kursk region tomorrow to help defend it against Ukraine’s ongoing incursion, the head of the Ukrainian Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR) told The War Zone Tuesday. That information comes as Seoul is considering sending advisors and heavy weapons to Ukraine in response to Pyongyang’s deployment to Russia of upwards of 12,000 soldiers, including elite special operations units. 'We are waiting for the first units tomorrow in the Kursk direction,' Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov told us. It is unclear at the moment how many or how they will be equipped. 'We will see after a couple of days,' he added. Alarm about North Korean troop movements to Russia is growing in South Korea. After a meeting to assess the situation, South Korea’s presidential National Security Council said Pyongyang’s deployment poses a 'significant security threat' to both South Korea and the international community and is a 'blatant violation' of U.N. Security Council resolutions prohibiting military cooperation with North Korea,' the South Korean Yonhap News Agency reported on Tuesday. 'If the illegal military cooperation between North Korea and Russia continues, (South Korea) will not stand by but respond firmly in collaboration with the international community,' Principal Deputy National Security Adviser Kim Tae-hyo said, according to Yonhap. He warned of 'phased measures' in response to the level of their military ties. (LEAD) S. Korea vows to take 'phased measures' in response to N. Korea-Russia military cooperation Yonhap News Agency (@YonhapNews) October 22, 2024 'There is a possibility that personnel will be sent to Ukraine to monitor the tactics and combat capabilities of North Korean special forces dispatched in support of Russia,' Yonhap reported, citing a source. 'If deployed, the team is expected to be composed of military personnel from intelligence units, who could analyze North Korean battlefield tactics or take part in interrogations of captured North Koreans.' There are also unconfirmed reports that North Korea has sent fighter pilots to Russia. A South Korean government official claimed last month that North Korea 'dispatched fighter pilots to Vladivostok, a city in the Russian Far East, ahead of the first deployment of its ground troops on October 8,' Newsweek reported, citing TV Chosun. 'This could relate to training on Russian combat aircraft supplied to North Korea, the report said. But it could not rule out that Russia, which has suffered from a shortage of pilots' during the all-out war, 'had requested assistance from the North.' Training North Koreans to operate Russian jets, most likely its familiar Su-25 Frogfoot attack jets, would present a host of challenges including language barriers and doctrine, but it isn't out of the question.

That system is also known as the M-SAM, or Medium-range Surface-to-Air Missile, which is already deployed in South Korea and is optimized to destroy lower-tier ballistic missile threats. Beyond that, South Korea, a major arms producer, could also provide offensive weapons, like artillery shells, howitzers, tanks and multiple launch rocket systems, Yonhap and the South Korean Chosun-TV media outlet posited. Since the outbreak of the war, South Korea has provided the United States with 155mm shells 'on the condition that the U.S. is the ‘end user’ — a method that observers say might have enabled Seoul to give indirect arms support to Ukraine as the U.S. sends its own stockpiled munitions to Ukraine,' Yonhap noted.

'Other possible weapons systems that might be considered include South Korea's homegrown K9 self-propelled howitzers, K2 main battle tanks, and Chunmoo multiple rocket launchers.' Though not mentioned in any local media reports, South Korea also possesses indigenously produced ballistic missiles and combat jets, among other advanced systems, that would be of extreme interest to Kyiv. South Korea isn’t the only country contemplating increased support to Ukraine over the deployment of troops from the North. Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis told Politico on Sunday that it’s time for European countries to revisit French President Emmanuel Macron’s idea of deploying troops to Ukraine. 'If information about Russia’s killing squads being equipped with North Korean ammunition and military personnel is confirmed, we have to get back to ‘boots on the ground’ and other ideas proposed by Macron,' Landsbergis told the news outlet.

Rutte urged Seoul to send a delegation to NATO 'to share data and suggested boosting cooperation in the defense industry and security dialogue among South Korea, Ukraine and NATO to respond if the North sends more soldiers to Russia.' Yoon asked for access to NATO's battle management system. 'We hope that the procedure for joining NATO's Battlefield Information Collection and Exploitation Systems (BICES) is quickly finalized so that we can communicate with NATO in real-time and share data safely and effectively,' Yoon said, the South Korean Korea.Net news outlet reported. 'The NATO chief responded by saying he would strive to ensure swift progress.' On Twitter, Rutte said North Korea sending troops to Russia 'would mark a significant escalation.'

Those troops 'are expected to be deployed to the front lines as soon as they complete their adaptation training.' At least six of Pyongyang’s forces, as we previously noted, have already been killed in Ukraine. On Tuesday, the independent Russian ASTRA news outlet published video on Telegram claiming to show North Korean troops in Russia. 'ASTRA geolocated a video that, as its creators behind the scenes claim, shows the arrival of North Korean soldiers at a military base,' the outlet reported. 'Apparently, this is military unit 44980 of the 127th Motorized Rifle Division in the village of Sergeyevka in Primorsky Krai.'

It calls for each side to provide military assistance to each other in the event of war. With that strategic partnership in place, having intelligence troops on the front to learn about Russia's capabilities would be an important asset for South Korea. As the war in Ukraine grinds on, North Korea’s supply of troops and arms to Russia helps Vladimir Putin continue his fight. The Pentagon recently said that some 600,000 Russian troops have been killed and wounded since the all-out invasion was launched in February 2022 and that September saw the highest rate of casualties of any month since. In response to assertions that her country is sending troops to Russia, Kim Jong-un, the powerful sister of North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un slammed South Korea and Ukraine on Tuesday for what she claimed was a military provocation against Pyongyang. She likened the two countries to 'bad dogs bred by the U.S,' the Korea JoongAng Daily reported. 'A military provocation against a nuclear weapons state may be led to horrible situation, unimaginable for politicians and military experts in any big or small country in the world with their normal thinking to experience,' she said in the statement carried by the Korean Central News Agency.

'If it's true that the DPRK soldiers are going there to join the war against Ukraine, it would certainly mark a dangerous and highly concerning development,' White House National Security spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Monday. On background, U.S. officials, East Asian diplomats and congressional aides are saying there is not much the U.S. to stop North Korea from sending troops to Russia. 'They concede that Washington has made little to no progress in slowing North Korea’s rogue nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, and if it can’t do that, it can only do so much to halt North Korean troop deployments to Russia, too,' those sources told Politico. There is no indication that the Biden administration will change its policies regarding 'no U.S. boots on the ground' in Ukraine or allowing it to use long-range weapons deep inside Russia as the result of these developments. However, as one of the world's best arms manufacturers with a deep reserve of ammunition, South Korea's direct involvement in this war could represent a significant boost to Ukraine's defense.

Japan Expands Carrier Capabilities With F-35B, Drones Could Be Ne...	A U.S. Marine Corps F-35B stealth fighter has for the first time operated aboard Japan’s biggest in-service warship, the Izumo class ‘multifunctional destroyer’ Kaga. We have previously reported on the significant modifications made to this amphibious assault ship to ensure it can operate the short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) jets, which Japan is also acquiring. At the same time, there are signs that Japan may also be looking to expand the fixed-wing capabilities of this class of vessel, including drones and potentially other crewed platforms. A Marine Corps F-35B flown by a test pilot from Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Two Three (VX-23) landed aboard Kaga for the first time on October 20, off the southern coast of California. The vessel is currently embarking an integrated test team as part of the developmental test effort to certify the modified vessel for operating F-35Bs. Lt. Cdr.

The Phalanx 20mm close-in weapon system (CIWS) previously mounted on the front of the warship was also removed. Subsequently, further modifications involved re-balancing and structurally reinforcing Kaga’s hull. Kaga shortly before pulling away from its dock in Kure City, Hiroshima Prefecture, in April 2023. @betafujihara via X Kaga was originally launched in 2015 and commissioned in 2017. Japan has previously tested the U.S. Marine Corps F-35B from the deck of a modified Izumo class warship, when the name ship of the class undertook trials in October 2021, as you can read about here. This was the time that Japan had operated fixed-wing aircraft from ships since the end of World War II. A video showing those trials is embedded below. Izumo was commissioned in 2015 and completed its first phase of modifications in 2021. However, the second phase of modifications, including the Kaga-style squared-off flight deck, are not scheduled to begin until March next year. Tokyo took the decision to modify its two Izumo class vessels for STOVL operations back in 2018, although there had previously been rumors that a return to fixed-wing carrier aviation was always likely, despite official statements to the contrary. While officially described as ‘multifunctional destroyers,’ the Izumo class warships were primarily helicopter carriers, prior to the STOVL modifications. Kaga arriving at Tanjung Priok port in Jakarta, Indonesia on September 18, 2018. Note the bow design before the remodeling, with the Phalanx CIWS fitted. Photo by Andrew Lotulung/NurPhoto via Getty Images Once modified, the two warships will be able to embark Japan’s F-35Bs. 42 are on order and they will be operated by the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF), which also has a growing fleet of conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) F-35A versions. As the tests with U.S. Marine Corps F-35Bs suggest, the modifications to the vessels also pave the way to interoperability with American F-35Bs. While this would help maximize the utility of these vessels, especially bearing in mind the JASDF’s relatively small F-35B fleet, there remain questions about the feasibility of longer-term Marine Corps deployments aboard Japan’s carriers. This is something that also applies to the United Kingdom, which has raised the possibility of embarking Marine Corps F-35Bs more regularly to help boost its carrier strike potential. HMS Queen Elizabeth embarking F-35Bs from British and American squadrons during maneuvers in 2020. Crown Copyright Still, even if embarked on a more ad-hoc basis, or during cross-deck operations, Marine Corps F-35Bs will likely go to sea aboard the Izumo class in the future. What aircraft might join them is somewhat more intriguing. Last week, at the Japan International Aerospace Exhibition in Tokyo, General Atomics Aeronautical Systems (GA-ASI) presented a rendering showing its carrier-capable Gambit 5 drone — which is based around a common modular core ‘chassis’ concept — operating from an Izumo class warship. Concept artwork showing the carrier-capable Gambit 5 drone operating from the Izumo. GA-ASI This is not the first time that we’ve seen the Gambit 5 presented on an aircraft carrier. The drone was revealed in the form of concept artwork showing it on a Queen Elizabeth class vessel for the United Kingdom at the Farnborough Airshow in July. You can read about the overarching Gambit 5 concept here. A rendering featuring a catapult-equipped Queen Elizabeth class carrier with a Gambit-series drone ready to launch. GA-ASI Regarding the Gambit 5 on the Izumo class, C. Mark Brinkley, a General Atomics spokesman, explained to TWZ: 'It’s meant to open the discussion with attendees on sea-based options for autonomous collaborative platforms because we see that as a very real opportunity for many nations.' As to the drone itself, while the Gambit 5 is now also being suggested for short takeoff and landing (STOL) operations from land bases, it was originally developed for shipboard use. A company rendering of the Gambit 5 operating from a flattop. GA-ASI 'The biggest challenges for Gambit 5 are sea-basing challenges, not specifically short takeoff and landing,' Brinkley added. 'The ship is moving, the deck is moving, the weather and climate play a role. We’ve invested years of research and investment on projects such as the U.S. Navy’s Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) program and Carrier-Based Aerial-Refueling System (CBARS). We understand the challenges to operating uncrewed jets at sea, and we know that Gambit 5 can be made real.' Putting advanced drones on carriers is a growing area of interest right now, with China, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States all exploring options of how best to integrate uncrewed platforms, of different sizes, on these warships. In particular, the potential for smaller aviation-capable vessels to operate drones is being explored, with Turkey notably even seeking to field a carrier that’s specifically tailored to support drones. The Turkish Navy flagship, Anadolu, which is planned to be used as a carrier for different tiers of armed drones. Photo by Serhat Cagdas/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images In the case of the Gambit 5 concept, the vessel is provided with catapults to launch the drones, as was the case with the Queen Elizabeth class concept. However, the British carrier differs from the Izumo class in being equipped with a ‘ski jump’ launch ramp, originally for STOVL operations. The British announced plans last year to integrate assisted launch systems and recovery gear onto the ships in the future. Although there is no confirmation at this stage that Japan plans something similar for its smaller Izumo class ships, it would make them able to operate fixed-wing drones, and potentially even other fixed-wing crewed aircraft. As well as the Gambit 5 and F-35B, the GA-ASI concept artwork shows F/A-18E Super Hornet fighters and an E-2 Hawkeye airborne early warning and control aircraft operating from the Izumo class. While Japan already operates the E-2 in a land-based capacity, it has no known plans to acquire fixed-wing carrier fighters in the Super Hornet class. A Japan Air Self-Defense Force E-2C Hawkeye during the Cope North exercise at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam. U.S. Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Courtney Witt Airman First Class Courtney Witt There are huge challenges in adapting carriers that are already fixed-wing-capable to accommodate even slightly larger aircraft, due to space requirements and the dimensions of existing elevators and other infrastructure. Even if Japan was in the market for carrier-based non-STOVL fighters and E-2s, whether they would be able to incorporate them in the Izumo class is another question entirely. Also shown in the artwork is an SH-60 Seahawk series helicopter, a type used by Japan previously aboard a wide range of warships, including the Izumo class. Not shown, but another important type for the Izumo class is the MV-22 Osprey tiltrotor, of which Japan is currently the only export operator. Nevertheless, the artwork does reflect the potential that the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) and the Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG) that GA-ASI first developed for the U.S. Navy’s Ford class aircraft carriers could also bring new capabilities to the Izumo class and other aviation-capable vessels. We have discussed in the past how EMALS and AAG are well suited to bringing drones into carrier air wings since they can be finely tuned in terms of the forces they exert on aircraft during launch and recovery. This makes them especially relevant for operators looking to utilize smaller and lighter drone designs from flattops. For Japan, having a carrier-capable drone like the Gambit 5 would provide a powerful adjunct to the F-35B. The Gambit 5 was derived from the air-to-air-capable Gambit 2, but it could also be used for strike as well as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). Drones such as the Gambit 5 and or the same company’s MQ-9B STOL could bring important boosts in capability and overall capacity to Japan’s carrier air wings, which are now very much in their infancy. Faced with the prospect of a potential confrontation with China, armed carrier-based drones could help Japan generate critical additional ‘mass,’ supporting F-35B missions including in more hazardous scenarios, engaging targets in the air, at sea, and on land. Even unarmed drones would be valuable force multipliers, conducting missions such as ISR, command and control, extending targeting capabilities, and boosting situational awareness. Meanwhile, a drone like the MQ-25 Stingray, provided it could be integrated on the Izumo, would deliver aerial refueling to extend the reach of the carriers’ F-35Bs. A prototype MQ-25 Stingray. Boeing www.twz.com At this stage, it’s not clear if Japan is actively planning to add drones to the future air wings of the Izumo class and, if it does, whether they would be fixed-wing types requiring launch and recovery gear to be added. 'We are absolutely talking to potential customers at Farnborough about the concept,' Brinkley said in the summer, when the Gambit 5 was unveiled, but did not name any specific prospective buyers. The U.S. Navy is already signaling the centrality of drones in future carrier operations, with plans to eventually have up to 60 percent uncrewed aircraft in its carrier air wings. Very likely, Japan is watching such developments closely and looking at the options for adding drones to its already very capable Izumo class vessels. Until then, Japan will continue to work toward having crewed stealth fighters operational on these two warships, with the recent test flights by a Marine Corps F-35B the latest step toward achieving this.

Smarter MQ-1C Gray Eagle Is Getting Mojave’s Short Field Capabili...	General Atomics Aeronautical Systems (GA-ASI) has provided details on the latest iteration of its MQ-1C Gray Eagle uncrewed aerial system (UAS), specifically the Gray Eagle STOL, or Short Takeoff and Landing variant. The new version of the drone incorporates technology that was first demonstrated on the company-funded Mojave, a heavily armed drone descended from the Gray Eagle that was also designed to be ideally suited to operating from remote or austere locations with rough strips and limited logistical support. The new drone is also very clearly pitched toward the U.S. Army and foreign customers that need increase distributed operations — as evidenced in the concept art at the top of this story — dispersed operations in the Pacific specifically. GA-ASI describes the Gray Eagle STOL as its 'most rugged UAS design,' although it’s worth noting at this point that the basic MQ-1C Gray Eagle for the U.S. Army was already something of a design that put a premium on efficiency and usability. Derived from the Air Force’s Predator, the Gray Eagle — originally known as the Warrior — was tailored for warfare in the Middle East, used a heavy-fuel piston engine instead of a turboprop, and was intended to be operated by a cadre of enlisted soldiers. A U.S. Army MQ-1C Gray Eagle. U.S. Marine Corps photo by Cpl. William Chockey A U.S. Army MQ-1C Gray Eagle at Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center (MCAGCC), Twentynine Palms, California. U.S. Marine Corps photo by Cpl. William Chockey Further reducing the footprint in terms of logistics and crews, the MQ-1C was designed to take off and land automatically through secure line-of-sight links, before flying beyond-line-of-sight missions via satellite communications. Enhancements for the MQ-1C soon followed, including an extended-range model with double the range and endurance, a test example staying aloft for nearly two days nonstop in a demonstration above Southern California. Building upon the MQ-1C Gray Eagle, GA-ASI is now offering the Gray Eagle STOL, which emphasizes the ability to operate from unimproved surfaces or even ships at sea, thanks to its short takeoff and landing capability, which was previously proven using the Mojave, first flown in 2021. GA-ASI’s Mojave demonstrator during takeoff and landing trials on a dirt strip near El Mirage, California, on August 1, 2023. GA-ASI Using the Gray Eagle STOL, 'commanders can choose virtually any bases of operation and take advantage of unconventional locations not normally affiliated with unmanned aircraft or aviation operations as an added level of survivability and surprise,' GA-ASI asserts. The Mojave’s ability to take off and land in very short distances — including on dirt strips — is something we have reported on before. Its stated performance includes a takeoff run of 400 feet for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions, or 1,000 feet when armed with 12 Hellfire missiles. Other weapons options include the Dillon Aero DAP-6 Minigun, which has been live-fire tested from the Mojave at Army’s Yuma Proving Ground. Its STOL attributes also lend the Mojave to shipborne operations, as demonstrated during trials aboard the British aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales. The short-field performance is such that the Mojave can also conduct carrier-based operations, in certain configurations, without any need for a catapult to launch it or arresting gear during recovery. This STOL performance has now been ported over to the Gray Eagle STOL, as C. Mark Brinkley, a General Atomics spokesman, described to TWZ. 'Mojave is simply a demonstrator model for our overall STOL concept, meant to show the possibilities afforded by our medium-altitude, long-endurance UAS when STOL capability is added. It’s one-of-a-kind and was not designed to go into production as it is currently built. We continue to use it as a technology demonstrator and have some upcoming demos scheduled, as well as some public showings planned at various trade shows next year.' With that in mind, the Gray Eagle STOL also adds some features that were not found on the Mojave. These include the various technologies introduced on another improved development of the MQ-1C, namely the Gray Eagle 25M (or GE 25M), first flown in December 2023. Gray Eagle 25M. GA-ASI The Gray Eagle 25M was developed to provide the U.S. Army with the option to procure a more advanced version of the MQ-1C, which would incorporate various enhancements to better meet the demands of a future conflict, likely to be expeditionary peer conflicts rather than a counterinsurgency fight. Among these new features are an improved heavy-fuel engine, increased onboard power, significantly reduced maintenance requirements, and an expeditionary laptop-based ground control station. Brinkley says the new Heavy Fuel Engine 2.0 'increases reliability, durability and horsepower, from 180 to 200 horsepower. It features dual brushless generators, which will dramatically reduce field maintenance and deliver over 50 percent more electrical power for new payloads and mission capabilities. The new engine, gearbox, and generator design decreases major maintenance actions and virtually eliminates the need for overhaul. The design effort was focused on reducing field maintenance and extending the time between engine replacement by 40 percent over the current Gray Eagle engine.' The Gray Eagle 25M also has an improved flight computer, with five times more processing capacity, and a modular open system architecture to ensure new capabilities can be integrated quickly and relatively cheaply. According to GA-ASI, these might include new air-launched effects and long-range sensors. In fact, the manufacturer is making a lot of the Gray Eagle 25M’s ability to work with air-launched effects. In one press release, GA-ASI lays out a scenario in which the Gray Eagle 25M lobs air-launched effects toward enemy air defense systems in a large and very contested battlefield. As the air-launched effects close in on the air defenses, the Gray Eagle 25M acts as 'quarterback,' relaying data gathered by the smaller drones to other friendly elements, be they aircraft, long-range fires, or other platforms. Concept artwork from GA-ASI showing a Gray Eagle 25M launching the company’s Eaglet air-launched drones. GA-ASI The Gray Eagle 25M is fitted as standard with the EagleEye synthetic aperture radar, which can detect and track ground targets out to 50 miles and maritime targets out to 124 miles. 'We are developing a new Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) antenna and associated software for EagleEye, which will further increase its range and deliver significant mode enhancements, Brinkley says. 'The radar’s increased range and optimized multi-mode performance will allow the aircraft to operate well outside the weapons effects zone of most threat systems, adding another layer of survivability.' Reflecting the increasing threat posed by hostile electronic warfare jamming, especially to GPS networks, the Gray Eagle 25M is also designed for greater resilience, including vision-based navigation that can be used to overcome GPS jamming, and SATCOM anti-jam technologies. GA-ASI says that all of the improvements found in the Gray Eagle 25M are now also incorporated in the Gray Eagle STOL. However, with different engines, wings, and tails, the Gray Eagle 25M and Gray Eagle STOL are very different aircraft, and the STOL version is not available as a conversion kit for GE 25M. The end result is a drone that combines advanced features with the ability to fly a wide variety of missions, from land and sea. At the forefront of the expected spectrum of missions are expeditionary ones of the kind that would be likely in any future high-end conflict, such as one in the Pacific against China. The Gray Eagle STOL is being pitched for reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (RSTA), as well as attack, contested logistics, and other missions, in just such scenarios. Logistics is not a role that has traditionally been associated with drones of this kind. However, GA-ASI has explored the idea of underwing pods capable of carrying up to 1,000 pounds of cargo. The U.S. military sees diverse distributed logistics chains as increasingly essential for supporting future operations in contested environments, especially in the context of a potential future high-end conflict, including in the Pacific. As GA-ASI describes it: 'Gray Eagle STOL might go with American forces into an expeditionary base deep downrange, co-locating with them as necessary to support missions, including delivery of supplies with the range to reach from island chain to island chain for units separate from the main body. Operating from a semi-prepared landing zone, a dirt road, or any paved surface, it expands commanders’ options.' As we have reported in the past, GA-ASI sees a particular niche for the Gray Eagle STOL in the U.S. Army’s requirement for an armed scout and overwatch platform. In February this year, the Army announced it was canceling its Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) program, which was focused on the acquisition of a new armed scout helicopter, as part of a broader reshuffling of its future aviation plans to include a greater focus on uncrewed systems. Concept artwork for the Boeing entry in the U.S. Army’s now-canceled Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft program, or FARA. Boeing www.twz.com 'We’re trying to jump into that [opportunity],' GA-ASI’s Alexander told Breaking Defense in a previous interview when talking about pitching the Gray Eagle STOL as potential a gap-filler in the wake of the FARA program’s cancellation. 'We believe a Gray Eagle STOL would offer the Army new attack reconnaissance capabilities unlike any previous uncrewed system,' GA-ASI’s Brinkley also told The War Zone. 'We have already demonstrated Mojave’s ability to operate from austere and rugged dirt roads, to take off and land from a ship at sea, and now to attack targets with machine gun fire.' Whether or not the Army decides that the new drone would be a good fit for its armed scout and overwatch requirements remains to be seen, especially with lingering concerns about the survivability and, by extension, the utility of non-stealthy medium-altitude armed drones like these. In its favor, like the Gray Eagle in service today, the Gray Eagle STOL can also team with AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, a capability of increasing importance within the Army. Also now being pitched by GA-ASI is the MQ-9B STOL, which will come in the form of a conversion kit conferring STOL capability on the existing MQ-9B SkyGuardian and SeaGuardian. MQ-9B SeaGuardian. GA-ASI GA-ASI 'We are taking the lessons learned from the Mojave prototype and Gray Eagle STOL program to develop MQ-9B STOL,' Brinkley told TWZ. 'One airframe, with multiple configurations and mission options. It’s a huge win for MQ-9B customers.' The MQ-9B STOL is a significantly bigger aircraft than the Gray Eagle 25M/STOL. The MQ-9B has a 38-foot fuselage, 79-foot wingspan, turboprop engine, and maximum takeoff weight of 12,500 pounds. This compares with a 28-foot fuselage, 58-foot wingspan, and maximum takeoff weight of 4,400 pounds for the GE 25M. At the very least, the Gray Eagle STOL and MQ-9B STOL signal that there remains a lot of potential within the original MQ-1C Gray Eagle and MQ-9B platforms, and GA-ASI is continuing to adapt these aircraft to better suit the future battlefield.

Israel Trades Increasingly Bellicose Threats With Iran As Retalia...	Israel and Iran are ratcheting up the rhetoric ahead of Jerusalem’s coming response to Tehran’s massive Oct. 1 ballistic missile attack involving about 180 ballistic missiles. The Israeli retaliation operation against Iran 'will be more forceful than initially planned, due to drone attack on PM Netanyahu’s home,' Israeli media reported. An explosive drone launched by Hezbollah from Lebanon hit Netanyahu’s private home in the coastal town of Caesarea on Saturday, Axios reported. He was not home and there were no casualties.

'Iran has made up its mind about the targets it may hit in a defensive response to the Israeli regime’s possible strike,' Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Esmaeil Baqaei told reporters on Monday, according to the official Iranian Tasnim news outlet. 'Iran’s finger is on the trigger as a greater surprise is awaiting the Zionists,' Tasnim stated. An Iranian military source told the publication that 'if the Zionist regime strikes Iran’s military sites, Tehran’s response will be ‘decisive’ and ‘beyond the estimates of Zionists.’' If Israel targets Iran’s nuclear sites, 'Iran will react and also reconsider its nuclear policies, the source added.' In addition, Iran warned Israel 'that if it targets Iran’s facilities and infrastructures in any manner, Iran will by no means remain committed to maintaining the scope, type and intensity of its measures at the previous level.'

'Yes and yes,' he told reporters when asked if he knew the plans. 'No and no,' he responded when asked if would reveal them.

The ongoing Israeli response has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians. 'I cannot sit here today and tell you that that negotiations are about to restart in Doha or Cairo or anywhere else for that matter,' Kirby said in response to a question from CNN’s Kayla Tausche Monday. Biden is 'deeply concerned' about the disclosure of classified documents regarding Israel's plans for its retaliation against Iran that found their way into the public sphere, National Security communications spokesperson John Kirby told reporters Monday afternoon. The White House could not say at the moment whether the documents were leaked or hacked. 'You can rest assured that he will be actively monitoring the progress of the investigative effort to figure out how this happened,' Kirby said. The documents, dated October 15 and 16, began circulating online Friday after being posted on the Iranian-linked Middle East Spectator Telegram channel. 'An informed source within the U.S. intelligence community has shared with us an extremely sensitive 'top secret' U.S. intelligence document from the NGIA, dated Oct, 15-16, detailing Israeli preparedness for an extensive strike inside Iran,' Middle East Spectator claimed. One of the documents, which says it was compiled by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGIA), 'says the plans involve Israel moving munitions around,' according to CNN. 'Another document says it is sourced to the National Security Agency and outlines Israeli air force exercises involving air-to-surface missiles, also believed to be in preparation for a strike on Iran. CNN is not quoting directly from or showing the documents.' The documents are meant to be seen only by the US and its ‘Five Eyes’ allies — Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom,' according to CNN, adding that the US is investigating the leak, A US official said the investigation 'is examining who had access to the alleged Pentagon document. Any such leak would automatically trigger an investigation by the FBI alongside the Pentagon and US intelligence agencies,' the network noted. 'The FBI declined to comment.' While the U.S. said the documents are real, and there are no indications they are not, there is always the possibility that even parts of them were disclosed on purpose as part of an information operation. The US is investigating a leak of highly classified US intelligence about Israel’s plans for retaliation against Iran, according to three people familiar with the matter. One of the people familiar confirmed the documents’ authenticity. CNN Breaking News (@cnnbrk) October 19, 2024 Israel gave the U.S. a document last week 'with its conditions for a diplomatic solution to end the war in Lebanon and allow displaced civilians from both sides of the border to return to their homes,' Axios reported, citing two U.S. officials and two Israeli officials. Israeli officials said the paper came out of discussions Israeli Minister for Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer - a confidant of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - had with the Israeli Ministry of Defense and the Israel Defense Forces 'about the principles Israel demands to be part of any diplomatic solution to end the war with Hezbollah,' the publication reported. One Israeli demand 'is that the IDF be allowed to engage in 'active enforcement' to make sure Hezbollah doesn't rearm and rebuild its military infrastructure in the areas of southern Lebanon that are close to the border,' Axios reported, citing an Israeli official. The official added that 'Israel also demands its air force have freedom of operation in Lebanese air space.' Scoop: Israel gave the White House its demands for ending the war in Lebanon.

The strikes were conducted in 'Beirut, southern Lebanon, and deep within Lebanese territory,' the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said Monday on Telegram. The funds, 'which Hezbollah used for terror activities, were stored by the Al-Qard al-Hassan Association, which directly funds Hezbollah's terror activities, including the purchase of weapons and payments to operatives in Hezbollah's military wing,' the IDF stated. 'The Hezbollah terrorist organization stores billions of dollars in the association's branches, including money that was directly held under the name of the terrorist organization.' The IDF claimed that before launching the attacks, 'numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including advance warnings issued via different platforms to the civilian population in the area.'

Earlier Monday, Israel Hayom reported that Hezbollah forces captured by the IDF in southern Lebanon testified in their investigations that Hezbollah paid money to UNIFIL personnel to use their bases for operations. 'These sources, privy to the details, revealed that Hezbollah also took control of UNIFIL cameras in compounds near the Israeli border and utilized them for their own purposes,' Israel Hayom reported. 'In light of these revelations and UNIFIL's glaring failure to prevent Hezbollah's entrenchment along the border Israel plans to rely primarily on commitments from the Lebanese army in any future arrangement with Lebanon, rather than on UNIFIL, which has proven ineffective over the years and is now accused of frequently collaborating with Hezbollah operatives.'

The Jerusalem Post (@Jerusalem_Post) October 21, 2024 The UN, meanwhile, repeated its complaint that the IDF is striking UNIFIL forces in southern Lebanon. 'Yet again, we remind the IDF and all actors of their obligations to ensure the safety and security of UN personnel and property and to respect the inviolability of UN premises at all times,' UNIFIL stated. The mission also reiterated 'that the violation of a UN site and damage to its assets constitutes a flagrant violation of international law and Security Council resolution 1701, the unanimously adopted text to end to a 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah and chart a path towards security on the border between Israel and Lebanon.' In addition, it stated that the Israeli army 'has repeatedly asked UNIFIL to vacate its positions along the Blue Line and has deliberately damaged UN positions.' Despite the pressure on the mission and troop-contributing countries, UNIFIL stressed that peacekeepers remain in all their positions, the mission’s statement said on Sunday. 'We will continue to carry out our mandated tasks of monitoring and reporting,' the statement concluded.

Our First Look At Land-Based Aegis Missile Defense System In Guam	We have gotten what appears to be our first view of a Mk 41 vertical launch system (VLS) for the Aegis Ashore air defense system that has been installed on the highly strategic American island of Guam in the Pacific. The land-based Mk 41 launchers are one step toward addressing the vulnerabilities of the U.S. military bases on the island to attack — something that China, in particular, has directly referenced in the context of a full-scale conflict in the region. Ultimately, Aegis Ashore on Guam will be just one element in plans to make the island’s airspace the most heavily defended anywhere on Earth. A photo showing the VLS array installed in an above-ground structure was published by the Defense Visual Information Distribution Service (DVIDS) on October 17. The image was part of a series from Joint Task Force Micronesia showing a visit to the island by Acting Under Secretary of the Navy Tom Mancinelli. Acting Under Secretary of the Navy Tom Mancinelli is greeted by Navy Cmdr. Mark Klein, commanding officer of Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron (HSC) 25, during a tour of Guam, Oct. 17. U.S. Navy photo by William J. Busby III William Busby According to information provided by DVIDS, Mancinelli received briefings from military leaders on 'critical defense infrastructure, force readiness, and emerging threats in the Indo-Pacific region.' Mancinelli was also shown flying over the island in a U.S. Navy MH-60 Seahawk helicopter, all part of his gaining a 'comprehensive understanding of key strategic locations across the island, highlighting Guam's essential role in U.S. military operations and regional security.' Acting Under Secretary of the Navy Tom Mancinelli tours Guam by helicopter with Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron (HSC) 25 on Oct. 16, 2024. U.S. Navy photo by William J. Busby III William Busby Most intriguing, however, is the photo showing the Mk 41 VLS array, the caption of which actually describes Mancinelli’s tour of a different air defense system — the U.S. Army Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery on the island. As TWZ has discussed before, THAAD has been deployed continuously to the island for many years now. It was sent there particularly to counter the possibility of a North Korean strike, as well as any other potential contingencies, but the growing threat from China far eclipses that of North Korea. As part of the efforts to drastically upgrade Guam’s defenses, the U.S. Navy is installing a version of the Aegis Ashore system on Guam, in addition to similar facilities in Poland and Romania, plus a dedicated test site in Hawaii. The U.S. Aegis Ashore site in Romania. USN Typically, Aegis Ashore facilities comprise a main ‘deckhouse’ and associated support building, as well as the VLS arrays seen in the photo at the top of this article. The deckhouse accommodates the Aegis Combat System and AN/SPY-1 radar, among other things, and mimics portions of Flight IIA Arleigh Burke class destroyers. This reflects the Aegis Ashore’s heritage in the sea-based Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) system, which you can read about in more detail here. Aegis Ashore is primarily designed to engage ballistic threats during the midcourse portion of their flight outside the Earth's atmophere using SM-3 interceptors. However, the Mk 41 is a modular launcher, meaning that additional anti-missile interceptors, such as the terminal-stage intercept and anti-air SM-6 and the forthcoming Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI), which could also be added. With its ability to take down certain incoming hypersonic threats, as well as other weapons, the GPI could be especially relevant for the defense of Guam. With additional launchers, even dispersed around the island, shorter-ranged missiles, such as the Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) Block II and even the latest SM-2s, could feasibly provide protection against air breathing threats, such as cruise missiles and drones. Patriot interceptors are now also now a possibility. While its capabilities are much in demand, there are various issues that make the installation of the traditional Aegis Ashore more complicated in Guam. Not only does the island have limited space for such a facility with the right lines of sight for its radar and radio systems, but the terrain is mountainous. In its basic configuration, Aegis Ashore needs a relatively large amount of flat open space and it has to be positioned to maximize radar coverage relative to potential threats. The difficulty in installing Aegis Ashore in an environment like this contributed to Japan’s decision to abandon its own plans for the system. An MDA briefing slide showing a notional layout of the Aegis Ashore site in Poland, as of 2013, given a sense of the physical space requirements. MDA As TWZ wrote in the past, 'placing portions of a future Aegis Ashore system on Guam in facilities underneath mountains or on mobile platforms on land, or even just off the coast, could certainly help with figuring out exactly how to make it work, from a basic design perspective, within the physical limitations that the island imposes.' The U.S. military previously said they planned to have the site operational by 2026. We have approached the Navy for comment on the current status of Aegis Ashore on Guam. Ultimately, Aegis Ashore should be much better adapted to Guam’s specific requirements, forming part of the planned Enhanced Integrated Air and Missile Defense (EIAMD) system. Last year, the U.S. military revealed that a total of 20 separate sites were currently under consideration to host surface-to-air interceptors, radars, and more, under EIAMD. A map showing the 20 sites on Guam under consideration to host elements of the Enhanced Integrated Air and Missile Defense system. MDA Using a distributed and tiered ‘system of systems’ approach, EIAMD is planned to provide 360-degree air and missile defense for Guam, with capabilities to deal with a wide spectrum of aerial threats. While the VLS array photographed last week may look familiar, overall, Aegis Ashore in Guam will probably look very different from the sites in Eastern Europe. As well as the potential to integrate additional missiles into the versatile Mk 41 VLS, Guam’s Aegis Ashore could have its various elements distributed to a much more significant degree than its predecessors, improving survivability and making better use of the island’s challenging geography. In the past, there was talk of the possibility that portions of Guam’s Aegis Ashore site could go into bunkers underground or onto mobile platforms or even vessels. Based on this one photo, the site uses the standard above-ground structure for its VLS — at least for now. A satellite image of Guam. Google Earth 'I can see Aegis being underground or mobile,' the Missile Defense Agency’s (MDA) director, U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Jon Hill, said, back in 2021. 'It’s not new science separating radars from weapons.' That might still be an option in the future, especially as the Pentagon is well aware of the potential vulnerabilities of a fixed above-ground facility, especially in a major conflict with a near-peer adversary, like China. EIAMD will also include at least four AN/TPY-6 radars, which were formerly known as the Homeland Defense Radar-Guam. This radar makes use of technology developed for the Lockheed Martin Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) used in Alaska. The Long Range Discrimination Radar at Clear Space Force Station, Alaska. MDA MISSILE DEFENSE AGENCY As we have discussed previously, regardless of any vulnerabilities that might be inherent in the static and above-ground nature of the basic system, Aegis Ashore is intended to primarily provide an additional line of defense against limited ballistic missile strikes launched by smaller ‘rogue’ actors, such as Iran. It is not seen as a broader strategic deterrent or a more robust missile defense capability for an all-out war with a peer competitor. Taken by itself, Aegis Ashore would be vulnerable to attack by China, which would use saturation strikes by its growing ballistic missile arsenal to overwhelm it, as it targeted the various U.S. military bases across the island. However, in Guam, Aegis Ashore by itself would be more about providing complementary coverage to other anti-missile defenses, including the aforementioned THAAD. That system has its own limitations, only being capable of intercepting ballistic missiles in the terminal stages of their flight. At the same time, its AN/TYP-2 radar is unidirectional, so it cannot provide 360-degree coverage against incoming threats. But as the island's defenses rapidly evolve, Aegis ashore will be a core component of the sprawling Enhanced Integrated Air and Missile Defense system. Patriot, directed energy systems, and the Army's new Enduring Shield lower-tier air defense system, among others. are all likely to play a part. Taken together, this highly diverse and distributed system, which will also be able to link with warships, aircraft, and especially space-based surveillance systems, will make Guam arguably the most highly defended piece of land on the planet. A transporter-erector-launcher for interceptors associated with the THAAD system. DOD At the same time, even with the best air defenses available, wider concerns about survivability are driving the U.S. military to work on expanding its available basing options across the Pacific, to provide alternatives to well-established bases like those in Guam. This includes alternate operating locations on nearby islands in the Marianas archipelago. Even though questions remain about how Aegis Ashore in Guam will eventually look and what kinds of more survivable and other elements will be included in the overall air defense architecture, the photo of the new VLS underscores the fact that the Pentagon is now on its way to drastically upgrading the island's defenses. Hopefully the move to finally do so isn't too little, too late.

Questions Linger Over Australia’s Role In B-2 Spirit Strikes On Y...	The U.S. Air Force used air bases in Australia to support the strikes on Houthi weapons bunkers in Yemen by B-2 stealth bombers earlier this week. At this point, there is some confusion as to whether B-2s were among the aircraft that used Australian bases, but USAF tankers likely supported the bombers, launching refueling operations from Australian soil. You can read our initial coverage and analysis of the B-2 strikes in Yemen here. Regardless, the development reflects the expanding military and strategic alliance between the United States and Australia, which has included upgrades for Australian air bases, specifically to better accommodate U.S. bombers. The Australian Department of Defense has confirmed that Australian support for the U.S. strikes on Yemen on the night of October 16/17 did include 'access and overflight for U.S. aircraft in northern Australia.' A report from Australia’s national broadcaster ABC stated that 'A remote Northern Territory air base has been used as a staging post for this week’s major U.S. airstrike on underground Houthi weapons stores in Yemen.' This could point to Royal Australian Air Force Base Tindal, a remote installation south of Darwin, which has been receiving upgrades to better accommodate U.S. bomber deployments, as you can read about here. The work is projected to be completed in late 2026. Available low-resolution satellite imagery for the dates in question doesn’t show any B-2s at Tindal — which is not conclusive in itself — but there are other possible operating locations in northern Australia, including some auxiliary installations. RAAF Tindal seen in May of 2024 with the new apron for supporting U.S. bombers under construction. (Google Earth) Subsequently, the same broadcaster reported that the Australian Department of Defense would not confirm or deny whether U.S. aircraft involved in the strikes had taken off from Tindal. The emphasis on taking off may be critical here, as we will discuss later. The ABC report on the subject was then altered to include a statement from an Australian Department of Defense spokesperson who said that B-2s were not operating out of Tindal, but would not provide further comments, due to operational security. There has been plenty of speculation that B-2s at least used Tindal to recover to, landing there after the Yemen raid. That remains possible since the later Australian Department of Defense comment was in response to a question as to whether the stealth bombers were operating out of the base (i.e. taking off for the raid) as opposed to landing there afterward. As for the official U.S. line, this appears to point to a roundtrip from Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri, the main operating base for the type, although it may be the case that one or more Australian bases were made available as an alternative landing site, after the mission. If the flight was direct, it would have literally flown around the world. According to multiple US officials: The American B2 stealth bombers dropped multi-thousand pound bombs, not GBU-57's, on 5 underground Houthi weapons storage targets in Yemen last night. The choice of the B2, which flew roundtrip from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, was…&mdash; Jennifer Griffin (@JenGriffinFNC) October 17, 2024 The periodic presence of U.S. bombers in Australia is by no means new, dating back to the early 1980s, while larger-scale training exercises in the country have involved U.S. bombers since 2005. More recently, the Enhanced Air Cooperation Initiative has been in place, involving deeper efforts to have the RAAF and U.S. military aircraft work closer together, with regular bomber rotations since 2018. B-2s have been regular visitors to Australia in recent years, with four of the stealth bombers having deployed to RAAF Base Amberley, in Queensland, in 2022, something you can read more about here.

Photos — backed up by some satellite imagery — show KC-135 Stratotankers and KC-46 Pegasus tankers at Cairns Airport in Queensland and more KC-135s at RAAF Amberley, soon after the strikes. Even if B-2s didn’t make use of Australian bases for the raid, it seems that U.S. tankers did, which would explain references to 'access and overflight for U.S. aircraft in northern Australia.' An Australian official further told ABC that the support Australia provided was 'consistent with our long-standing alliance commitment and close cooperation, demonstrating the interoperability of our militaries.' 'Australia is committed to supporting the U.S., and key partners, in disrupting Houthi capabilities used to threaten global trade and the lives of mariners in the Red Sea, a vital international waterway,' an Australian Department of Defense spokesperson added.

U.S. Air Force photo by Staff Sgt. Spencer Tobler Staff Sgt. Spencer Tobler While the raids may well have degraded the Houthis’ ability to wage their ongoing campaign against shipping in the Red Sea region, as TWZ previously pointed out, they were also tailored to deliver a powerful and highly specific message to Iran, the Houthis’ primary benefactor. At this point, it’s unclear if that message was underscored by the use of the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, better known as the MOP, a weapon ideal for attacking targets including the extremely hardened sites related to Iran’s nuclear program. This looked like a distinct possibility, especially due to the fact that B-2s were used for the strikes. The MOP, weighing in around 30,000 pounds, can only be carried by the B-2. Two can be carried by each of the stealth bombers at a time. So far, the Air Force has not confirmed what weapons were used, although Air & Space Forces Magazine reports that the B-2s dropped 2,000-pound BLU-109-equipped GBU-31 Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM), citing a 'person familiar with the matter.' Munitions maintainers from around the Pacific assemble BLU-109 munitions at Osan Air Base, South Korea. U.S. Air Force photo/Staff Sgt. Stephenie Wade Staff Sergeant Stephenie Wade The BLU-109 is another precision munition with a penetrating warhead. Each B-2 can carry 16 of these weapons. It’s also possible that 5,000-pound class bunker-busters might have been used, although the exact status of this weapon in the B-2’s inventory is unclear. A very early graphic from the MOP program showing the bomb able to penetrate up to 60 feet under the ground. By 2007, the weapon was reportedly capable of burrowing nearly four times deeper than this. This also offers a comparison between the 2,000lb BLU-109-equipped guided bomb and 5,000lb GBU-28. DOD via GlobalSecurity.org As we reported at the time, whatever type of bunker-buster munitions were used by the B-2s, the raid was a very clear signal to Iran that the United States is uniquely well equipped to target critical facilities 'no matter how deeply buried underground, hardened, or fortified,' in the words of a Pentagon statement. While Iran was not mentioned by name, the implication is very clear. While acknowledging that it provided support to the United States, specifically in its effort to blunt the Houthis’ ability to target Red Sea shipping, Australia also didn’t mention Iran by name. Darwin lawmaker Luke Gosling told ABC that Australia works 'incredibly closely with the U.S. Air Force' in the north. Gosling added that there are 'no deliberate messages being sent from Australia, other than we are in lock-step with our allies in order to uphold a rules-based order upon which Australia’s security and prosperity is so dependent.' The most obvious example of the deepening relationship between Australia and the United States is the AUKUS initiative — standing for Australia, United Kingdom, United States. This is a wide-ranging effort, with standout items including the supply of nuclear-powered attack submarines to Australia, and increased intelligence sharing. A RAAF F-35A Lightning II, EA-18G Growler, and F/A-18F Super Hornet fly alongside a U.S. Air Force B-52H from the 23rd Expeditionary Bomb Squadron based at Guam during Exercise Talisman Sabre 21. Australian Department of Defense SGT Andrew Eddie At the same time, the United States has been ramping up bomber deployments at Tindal, while also sending bombers to other Australian air bases, as Washington continues to expand its military presence in the region. The upgrade work at Tindal includes an expanded apron with space for up to six B-52 strategic bombers, squadron operations facilities, and maintenance infrastructure. Once completed, the airbase will be much better able to host bomber detachments, as well as tankers and fighters, with work also addressing fuel and munitions storage and mission planning buildings. Work at Tindal, as well as AUKUS and other related developments, have been widely seen as a deterrent aimed toward China. While that remains true, it is now clear that the growing U.S. military footprint in Australia is also being leveraged to strike targets in the Middle East. Significantly, Tindal will add another forward operating location for U.S. bombers, on top of Hawaii, Guam, and Diego Garcia, also in the broader region. Although with appropriate tanker support, there is no reason why bombers can’t also use the base to support operations in the Middle East or elsewhere. It remains to be seen whether RAAF Base Tindal or any other base was used for the first time by B-2s conducting combat operations, but the fact that Australia was used to support air operations over Yemen, in and of itself, is a significant development, at a time of increasing military cooperation with the United States.

South Korea Intelligence Offers Assessment Of North Korean Troops...	South Korea’s spy agency released images on Friday claiming to show North Korean troops training at military bases in Russia’s far eastern region. The National Intelligence Service (NIS) said they are the initial wave of what South Korean officials say will be 12,000 North Korean troops, including members of its notorious special forces, fighting in Russia’s all-out war on Ukraine. 'The suspicions of ‘direct military cooperation between Russia and North Korea’ raised by foreign media outlets have been officially confirmed,' NIS stated. 'We will continue to track and confirm the movement of military cooperation between Russia and North Korea through close intelligence cooperation with allied countries.' That information comes a day after Ukraine’s spy boss told us that there are currently nearly 11,000 North Korean troops in eastern Russia, who will be ready to fight by Nov. 1. On Friday, Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, head of the Ukrainian Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR), told us that figure was revised upward to 11,800. At least six of Pyongyang’s forces, as we previously noted, have already been killed in Ukraine. The North Korean soldiers dispatched to Russia 'are currently stationed at Russian military bases in the Far East, including Vladivostok, Ussuriysk, Khabarovsk, and Blagoveshchensk,' South Korea’s National Intelligence Service (NIS) stated in a new assessment released Friday. Those troops 'are expected to be deployed to the front lines as soon as they complete their adaptation training.' All four bases are at least 4,000 miles east of Ukraine. NIS released images purporting to show at least 400 North Korean troops training at Ussuriysk and at least 240 at Khabarovsk. However, the number of troops and if they are even North Korean cannot be confirmed by the satellite imagery provided. A military facility in Ussuriisk, Primorsky Krai that South Korea's spy agency says shows an estimated 400 North Korean personnel gathered on a parade ground. (NIS) NIS claims there are about 240 North Korean troops gathered at a Russian military base in Khabarovsk. (NIS) NIS said it began observing North Korean troops in Russia back in early August. It detected First Vice Director of the Munitions Industry Department Kim Jong-sik - 'a key figure in North Korea’s missile development' - 'visiting the North Korean KN-23 missile launch site near the Russia-Ukraine frontline several times with dozens of North Korean military officers and providing on-site guidance,' the spy agency said in the assessment. NIS then 'closely monitored' the movements of the North Korean military and detected North Korea 'transporting its special forces to Russia via Russian naval transport ships from [Aug] 8th to the 13th, confirming the start of the North Korean military’s participation in the war.' To move these troops, the Russian Navy entered North Korean waters for the first time since 1900, according to NIS. '&#8230;four landing ships and three escort ships belonging to the Russian Pacific Fleet completed the first transfer of approximately 1,500 North Korean special forces from the areas near Chongjin, Hamhung, and Musudan to Vladivostok, Russia during the same period, and a second transport operation is expected to take place soon,' NIS explained. With more than 120,000 troops, North Korea has one of the world's largest special operations forces. They are tasked with five basic missions: conducting reconnaissance, performing combat operations in conjunction with conventional operations, establishing a second front in South Korea’s rear areas, countering South Korean/U.S. special operations forces in North Korea’s rear area, and maintaining internal security. Above all else, causing mayhem deep behind the front lines during a war with the South would be on the top of their to do list. It is known that these troops are North Korea's most hardened and go through extremely harsh training. Videos of their brutal demonstration have been circulating for years. NIS released a synthetic aperture radar satellite image claiming to show Russian ships at Musudan, less than 200 miles south of Vladivostok. The nature of the image makes that impossible to confirm without other supporting evidence. South Korea's spy agency claims this synthetic aperture radar satellite image shows Russian ships transporting North Korean troops to Russia. (NIS) This graphic from South Korea's spy agency claims to show the route Russian ships are taking to transport North Korean troops in the East Sea. (NIS) In addition, Russian Air Force AN-124 cargo jets 'have been frequently traveling between Vladivostok and Pyongyang,' NIS said. Before departing for Russia, North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un 'inspected the special forces unit twice before the deployment' on Sept. 11 and Oct. 2, according to NIS. North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un observed his special operations forces training before they departed for Russia. (NIS) The North Korean soldiers 'were issued Russian military uniforms and Russian-made weapons, and were also issued fake ID cards for residents of the Yakutia and Buryat regions of Siberia who look similar to North Koreans. It appears that they disguised themselves as Russian soldiers to hide the fact that they were deployed to the battlefield. Budanov confirmed that to The War Zone Friday. 'The first battalion of 2,600 troops will be formed in the 11th Airborne Brigade and are preparing for deployment in the Kursk region with documents of cover as Russian citizens from the Buryat and Yakutia regions,' he told The War Zone exclusively. In addition to what the NIS shared, other videos emerged on social media purporting to show North Korean troops training and being equipped in Russia. Video's have surfaced online allegedly showing North Korean soldiers at a Russian military base. The authenticity remains uncertain. If these are really North Korean soldiers is unconfirmed. pic.twitter.com/Ddzcn87NA3&mdash; NOELREPORTS (@NOELreports) October 18, 2024 Exclusive - Newly obtained footage from Russia's Sergievsky Training Ground showing North Korean troops being outfitted in Russian gear in preparation for deployment to Ukraine. pic.twitter.com/01Z4jZIiOe&mdash; SPRAVDI — Stratcom Centre (@StratcomCentre) October 18, 2024 The NIS assessment came after South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol 'convened an emergency security meeting amid mounting speculation that the North may be providing its soldiers to fight Russia's war in Ukraine,' the South Korean Yonhap News Agency reported. The presidential office said South Korea 'has been closely tracking North Korea's troop movement to Russia from the beginning in coordination with its allies, and will continue to monitor the situation and take all necessary measures proactively.' The North's move 'signals a major development in the military cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang besides their suspected arms trade, already criticized by the international community,' Yonhap posited. We reached out to the Pentagon and White House National Security Council for additional details and will update this story with any pertinent information they provide. This all comes in the wake of recent treaty negotiations between Moscow and Pyongyang. As we previously reported, Russian President Vladimir Putin submitted a draft law to the Russian State Duma recently seeking ratification of a strategic partnership between Moscow and Pyongyang, hammered out in June. It calls for each side to provide military assistance to each other in the event of war. Seoul has said it was considering changing its policy against providing lethal aide to Ukraine in response to that pact. In addition to offering new details about North Korean troop movements to Russia, NIS provided more granularity about Pyongyang’s shipment of arms to Moscow. NIS 'assessed that North Korea had provided Russia with a total of 13,000 containers of shells, missiles, and anti-tank rockets, as well as other lethal weapons, on approximately 70 occasions since August of last year.' The South Korean spy agency released satellite images purporting to be some of the vessels in North Korea's Nanjin port transporting the weapons to Russia. The Russian ship roll on/roll off container carrier Angara carrying North Korean weapons departing from Najin Port. (NIS) The Russian roll on/roll off container carrier Lady R carrying North Korean weapons departing from Najin Port. (NIS) As a result of GUR 'confirming North Korean weapons collected from the battlefield, the weapons North Korea provided to Russia included 122mm and 152mm shells, Bulsae-4 anti-tank missiles, short-range ballistic missiles such as the KN-23, and RPG anti-tank rockets,' the South Korean spy agency assessed. 'Considering the size of containers loaded on cargo ships traveling between North Korea and Russia, it appears that a total of more than 8 million 122mm and 152mm shells have been provided to Russia so far.' As we previously wrote, the Ukrainian government announced that the KN-23 short-range ballistic missiles that North Korea provided to Russia were used in attacks on major cities, including the Ukrainian capital Kyiv resulting in a significant number of civilian casualties. 'However, Ukrainian intelligence authorities analyzed that many North Korean weapons have a high defect rate and low accuracy, so they are being used for mass offensives to maintain the front line rather than precision strikes,' NIS added. As the war in Ukraine grinds on, North Korea's supply of troops and arms to Russia helps Vladimir Putin continue his fight. The Pentagon recently said that some 600,000 Russian troops have been killed and wounded since the all-out invasion was launched in February 2022 and that September saw the highest rate of casualties of any month since. Meanwhile, this could just be the start of a much larger deployment of North Korean forces to Russia. Pyongyang's greatest asset is the number of troops it has, with one of the largest standing armies on earth. While many are poorly trained and fed, Kim could trade large numbers of troops to Russia in exchange for things it desperately needs - hard currency, food and other goods, and military assistance. Russian doctrine is on display in Ukraine, flowing huge numbers of troops in so-called 'meat assaults' against Ukrainian positions. Even untrained North Koreans would help Russia continue to carry out those attacks. North Korea will also gain highly valuable combat experience on a modern battlefield, something it currently lacks. It remains to be seen just how well the North Korean troops will perform, but one South Korean military observer told us they will prove challenging to Ukraine. 'North Korean combat troops in Ukraine is alarming but not surprising,' said In-Bum Chun, a retired South Korean lieutenant general who ran that nation's special operations forces and is now a military analyst. 'They are the pick of the crop.' The public reaction in South Korea to news of North Korea sending troops to Ukraine 'is surprise and concern about the implications of these activities,' said Chun. 'I am sure the Ukrainians will have a challenge.'

Army Wants Its New Tank-Busting 155mm Artillery Shells To Work Co...	The U.S. Army is looking to give its still-in-development anti-armor guided 155mm artillery shells the ability to 'collaborate' with each other to help find their targets and otherwise be more effective. The rounds as they are envisioned now are already set to give artillery units a new option for engaging enemy tanks and other armored vehicles, even ones on the move, via indirect fires. Army Col. Leon Rogers, the service's Project Manager for Combat Ammunition Systems, provided an update on the Cannon Delivered Area Effects Munition Armor (C-DAEM Armor) 155mm shell, now also designated as the XM1180, at the Association of the U.S. Army's (AUSA) main annual conference in Washington, D.C., earlier this week. The C-DAEM Armor round, also known as C-DAEM Increment I, has been in development since 2018. The Army conducted the first live firing of a guided test article just this past March. A slide Col. Leon Rogers showed at this year's AUSA gathering showing plans for the C-DAEM Armor shell and other 155mm artillery ammunition developments. US Army 'C-DAEM Armor, XM1180, most people don't really know what that means, but what that gives the artillery community is a way to actually destroy armored targets,' Rogers explained. 'As you see in the future, it's about collaboration. Those rounds will be able to talk to each other.' Rogers highlighted specifically how this capability could help ensure that rounds don't double up on the same targets, facilitating a single barrage to engage and destroy more vehicles over a broader area. Networking the shells together could have other benefits, including helping the rounds fired find targets at all, even if they might be outside the range of their own onboard seekers. Depending on the level of collaboration and coordination between shells, as well as the ability of their seekers to not only spot, but categorize targets, they might also be able to focus their attention on target types that are pre-designated as being higher priority first. The current XM1180 design leverages the existing GPS-assisted inertial navigation system (INS) guided M982 Excalibur precision-guided 155mm shell, but adds a new and still unspecified all-weather seeker to find targets in the terminal stage of flight. There are future plans to develop a guidance package that is also less reliant on GPS to be more resilient in the face of jamming and spoofing, the importance of which has been underscored by observations from the ongoing war in Ukraine. C-DAEM Armor also features a new unitary shaped-charge armor-piercing warhead. In the past, it has been reported that the round is expected to have a maximum range of around 37 miles (60 kilometers) and the ability to scan up to nearly 11 square miles (28 square kilometers) for target vehicles. 'After the projectile has been fired, the sensors on the projectile will be used to search the area around its reported position, and if found, attack the target,' Peter Burke, Deputy Project Manager for Combat Ammunition Systems, said back in 2019, according to a report from Army Technology. As already noted, giving XM1180s the ability to collaborate between themselves could help eliminate the 'if found' from that equation and also help prevent targets from escaping being struck. The Army is not the only service to be interested in collaborative capabilities to improve targeting efficiency and effectiveness, as well as just reduce the number of munitions that are expended without hitting targets at all. The U.S. Air Force's Golden Horde program centered on the development of swarming networked air-launched munitions capabilities is one prime publicly known example. The baseline C-DAEM shell is already poised to give Army 155mm howitzers a valuable new precision indirect anti-armor capability. The Army's current Excalibur guided 155mm rounds cannot engage moving targets. The 1970s-era laser-guided M712 Copperhead 155mm shell, which was largely removed from service years ago, could hit moving vehicles, but also required a third party of some kind relatively close by to designate the target. As a prime example of the M712's limitations, earlier this year, The Wall Street Journal reported that Ukrainian forces had received Copperheads as military aid from the United States, but rarely employed them due to a lack of suitably equipped drones it could use to designate targets from afar. The Army also has unguided Dual-Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions (DPICM) shells, which are loaded with cluster munitions designed to defeat armored and unarmored targets. Cluster munitions, in general, have been increasingly controversial, in large part due to their potential to scatter unexploded submuntiions that can be threatening to friendly forces and innocent bystanders. You can read more about DPICM and these issues here. In addition to the XM1180, the Army is also currently developing a second round in the C-DAEM family called the XM1208, which is loaded with nine sensor-fuzed smart submunitions as a DPICM replacement. All of this now comes as the conflict in Ukraine has further underscored the value of artillery, particularly 155mm howitzers, on the modern battlefield, including for engaging enemy armor formations. On top of the Copperheads, the Ukrainian armed forces have received Excaliburs and DPICM rounds, among others, from the U.S. military. Recent videos from Ukraine’s 47th Mechanized Brigade showing FPV, DPICM, and Bradley fire on a Russian MT-LB with infantry; FPV strike on a Russian T-80BV tank with a roof screen causing a catastrophic loss; a Bradley IFV firing on Russian positions; and a video of a Russian… pic.twitter.com/hqgXVsra5e&mdash; Rob Lee (@RALee85) May 19, 2024 The U.S. military is working hard now to facilitate a dramatic boost in the production of 155mm shells of all kinds, including through the establishment of an entire new ammunition factory in the United States, to help meet Ukraine's demands as well as replenish its own stockpiles. At AUSA this week, Army officials said that 155mm shell production is now around 40,000 rounds per month, up from 14,400 shells per month prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The goals now are to get that figure up to 55,000 shells per month by the end of the year and eventually up to 100,000 shells per month in the future. Beyond more capacity to produce complete rounds, meeting these targets also requires expanded sources for various subcomponents, including shell bodies and explosive fillers. 'We don't get our TNT from any source in the U.S. right now,' Col. Rogers noted this week. 'And, oh, by the way, before the Ukraine war kicked off, just where we were getting our TNT from? Ukraine.' For the U.S. Army, there is also a growing question about what will fire C-DAEM Armor and any other 155mm shells in the future. The service announced this week that it was launching a new Self-Propelled Howitzer Modernization (SPH-M) effort to succeed its abortive Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA) program. The Army had announced in March that it was canceling work on the next-generation XM1299 155mm self-propelled howitzer it had been developing under ERCA as a successor to the venerable M109 series, due in part to issues with its extremely long cannon. The service has now awarded contracts to American Rheinmetall Vehicles, BAE Bofors, Hanwha Defense USA, General Dynamics Land Systems, and Elbit Systems USA to demonstrate alternative 155mm self-propelled howitzers as part of SPH-M. There have been separate discussions in recent years about options for modernizing or supplanting the Army's inventory of 155mm M777 and 105mm M109 towed howitzers, as well. A prototype the US Army had used in the development of the XM1299. US Army The Army has also said previously that the end of ERCA has put new emphasis on new, advanced 155mm shells, including long-range ramjet-powered types. The new C-DAEM Armor shell is already set to be an important part of that 155mm ammunition ecosystem and networked targeting capabilities could make artillery units even more effective in hunting enemy tanks and other vehicles in the future.

Nearly 11,000 North Korean Troops In Russia Preparing To Enter Th...	There are now nearly 11,000 North Korean infantry troops training in eastern Russia to fight in Ukraine, the head of the Ukrainian Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR) told The War Zone Thursday afternoon. 'They will be ready [to fight in Ukraine] on Nov. 1,' Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov told TWZ. The North Korean troops will be using Russian equipment and ammunition, said Budanov. The first cadre of 2,600 soldiers will go to Kursk, where Ukraine has established a heavily fought-over foothold (more on that later). It is unclear where the remaining North Korean troops will go, he added. 'We don't have the full picture right now,' said Budanov. Pyongyang's forces, as we previously noted, have already been killed in Ukraine. There are 11,000 North Korean troops training in Russia to fight Ukraine, Ukrainian Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, commander of the Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR), told us.(Howard Altman) Howard Altman Budanov’s comments came hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told reporters in Brussels that there are about 10,000 North Korean troops preparing to fight his country on behalf of Russia. Zelensky warned that a third nation wading into the hostilities would turn the conflict into a 'world war,' The Associated Press reported. The Ukrainian leader did not go into further details. Zelenskyy claims 10,000 North Korean troops are preparing to enter the war with Russia and some officers already been in occupied Ukraine helping the Russian armed forces use weapons provided by Pyongyang. via @HenryJFoy Christopher Miller (@ChristopherJM) October 17, 2024 A day earlier, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said in Seoul that Washington and its allies are alarmed by North Korea’s military support for Russia’s war in Ukraine but couldn’t confirm Ukrainian claims that North Korean soldiers were sent to fight for Moscow. On Tuesday, Ukrainian media reported that about 3,000 troops were forming part of the 'Special Buryat Battalion,' organized within the 11th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade of the Russian Armed Forces to fight in Ukraine.' As we previously reported, Russian President Vladimir Putin submitted a draft law to the Russian State Duma on Monday seeking ratification of a strategic partnership between Moscow and Pyongyang, hammered in June. It calls for each side to provide military assistance to each other in the event of war. In another sign of the burgeoning relationship between Moscow and Pyongyang, a report emerged on Thursday claiming that Russian troops are training to use North Korean self-propelled artillery. The Ukrainian-aligned ATESH group claimed on Telegram that a Russian soldier who is part of the organization said the training is underway at the Higher Artillery Command School in Saratov, about 300 miles east of Ukraine. ATESH did not specify what variant of self-propelled artillery North Korea provided. While The War Zone cannot independently verify this, we have written frequently about how North Korea is supporting Russia, including supplying ballistic missiles, artillery ammunition, and now, apparently, troops. russian military begins training on North Korean self-propelled gunsAn agent of the ATESH movement from the russian Armed Forces reports that in Saratov, at the recently restored Higher Artillery Command School, training of artillerymen on North Korean self-propelled… pic.twitter.com/gL5flsTOZa&mdash; Lew Anno Suport#Israel #Ukraine 24/2-22 (@anno1540) October 17, 2024 The Pentagon is looking into reports about North Korean troops fighting on behalf of Russia, but could not confirm them, Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told The War Zone during a press conference Thursday afternoon. 'If true, that would demonstrate an increase in the cooperation between Russia and North Korea, and I think that would also demonstrate the dire situation [Russia] finds itself in, in terms of its forces on the battlefield,' said Ryder. 'As you heard us recently say, the casualties that Russia is experiencing on the front lines are extremely significant, upward of 600,000 killed or wounded, and so it just demonstrates the desperation in terms of identifying additional forces for their military. It's something that will continue to keep a close eye on.' By deploying troops to Ukraine, North Korea may lead South Korea's Yoon Suk Yeol government to rethink its policy of not providing direct military support to Ukraine, a U.S. expert said Thursday. According to South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency, Victor Cha, Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, made the remarks following media reports that the Russian military is organizing the aforementioned special battalion of North Korean personnel amid manpower shortages. 'I would imagine, it would make President Yoon very upset, and who knows what he's going to do if he's really upset?' Cha said at a forum co-hosted by the Asan Institute for Policy Studies and the Brussels-based Center for Security, Diplomacy and Strategy. Reports of N. Korea sending troops to Russia may prompt Yoon to reconsider its support for Ukraine: U.S. expert Yonhap News Agency (@YonhapNews) October 17, 2024 Budanov's statement is another indication of North Korea's growing role in Russia's all-out war on Ukraine and that it seems the size of the troop contingent that will participate has already grown larger than some had originally thought. The Latest On the battlefield, more than two months after Ukraine first launched its invasion of Russia’s Kursk region, one news organization is making a contested claim about the status of that operation. Ukrainian troops have lost about half the territory captured, according to the Telegraph. 'A senior Russian commander from Chechnya said that an estimated 50,000 troops were pushing back Ukrainian forces, who either had to ‘flee or end up in the cauldron,’' the publication reported.

Well-connected Russian and Ukrainian military bloggers have been reporting since Saturday that Moscow’s troops have punched through sectors of Ukraine’s front lines in Kursk, the publication noted. Col.-Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukraine’s Armed Forces, last week confirmed that 50,000 Russians were fighting in Kursk, according to the Ukrainian Suspline news outlet. He stressed, however, that such actions led to the weakening of Russian groups in other areas, in particular in the Zaporizhzhia, Kherson regions and the Kramatorsk direction. 'The situation in the Kursk region remains difficult, but under control,' the Ukrainian DeepState open-source intelligence group said on Telegram last week. 'It was a difficult and tense night, the Defense Forces of Ukraine are indeed carrying out stabilization actions, but it has not yet been possible to regain control over everything that was lost.' Russians have 'suffered considerable losses during the assault, so it will be difficult for them to gain a foothold,' DeepState added. 'The worst is now, probably, in Lyubimovka, but we have to wait for the end of the new round of maneuver warfare.' Ryder on Thursday pushed back on the assessment that Russia has recaptured about half the territory it lost in Kursk. 'Based on the information I have, that is not accurate,' he told The War Zone. 'There has been a small amount of territory retaken by the Russians in Kursk, but at this stage, nothing that we would consider significant.' DeepState'a interactive battle map shows that Ukraine has lost territory in Kursk in the past few weeks, mostly in the northwestern sector of its salient. However, it does not appear to be as much as The Telegraph asserted. The gray shows the position of Ukrainian troops in Kursk on Sept. 21. (DeepState) Much of that territory has been recaptured by Russia as of Oct. 16, according to DeepState (DeepState) Some Russian milbloggers meanwhile have reported a slowdown in the effort to repel Ukrainian forces. Some Russian channels report a slowdown in efforts to repel an 'attempted invasion' in the Kursk region.

He made those comments Thursday during a press conference in Brussels, after presenting his 'Victory Plan' to European Union leaders. 'Either Ukraine will have nuclear weapons, which will serve as protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance,' he said he told the former U.S. president and current Republican presidential nominee, according to the Kyiv Independent. 'Apart from NATO, we do not know of such an effective alliance.' 'I believe Trump heard me and said that it was a fair argument,' he added. Zelensky also invoked the Budapest Memorandum, in which Ukraine agreed in 1994 to give up its nuclear arsenal in exchange for security guarantees from Russia, the U.S., and the U.K., the publication noted. 'The agreement resulted in Ukraine losing its nuclear shield, Zelensky argued, while other powers that have maintained their nuclear arsenal have not suffered from a full-scale war,' according to the Kyiv Independent. Zelensky emphasized that he would choose NATO membership over pursuing nuclear weapons. Zelensky spoke to Trump and said:'There are two choices.

Officials in Kyiv complain of a double standard because a THAAD battery has not been assigned to protect Ukraine, Politico noted. 'The reason why the U.S. acts boldly in Israel and cautiously in Ukraine is clear: Russia is armed with nuclear weapons and Iran isn’t,' a source told the publication. 'The tough answer that Ukrainians may not like to hear but is unfortunately true is that we can take the risk of shooting down Iranian missiles over Israel without triggering direct war with Tehran that could lead to nuclear war,' a senior U.S. Senate aide who works on Ukraine policy told Politico. 'There’s a lot more risk in trying that with Russia.' The announcement of its pending delivery comes ahead of an expected Israeli retaliation for Tehran’s massive missile barrage earlier this month.

The group, UAT-5647, also known as RomCom, 'has long been considered a multi-motivational threat actor performing both ransomware and espionage-oriented attacks,' the report states. 'However, UAT-5647 has accelerated their attacks in recent months with a clear focus on establishing long–term access for exfiltrating data of strategic interest to them. Our assessment, in line with recent reporting from CERT-UA and Palo Alto Networks, indicates that the threat actor is aggressively expanding their tooling and infrastructure to support a wide variety of malware components authored in diverse languages and platforms such as GoLang, C++, The RUST and LUA.' The cyber attack on high-profile Ukrainian entities is likely part of a two-pronged effort to steal data and place malware on these systems in order to disrupt and seek financial gain from the targets, the report concluded. 'It is also likely that Polish entities were also targeted, based on the keyboard language checks performed by the malware. In another cyber attack Russian hackers used Telegram to target the devices of Ukraine’s draft-aged men with the MeduzaStealer malware, Ukraine’s government computer emergency team stated in a separate report. MeduzaStealer 'was previously used by Russia-linked threat actors to obtain login credentials, computer information, browsing history and data from password managers,' according to The Record. 'Last year, a threat actor known as UAC-0050 deployed the malware against targets in Ukraine and Poland.'

Army Confirms It’s Exploring Requirements For A New Heavy-Lift He...	The U.S. Army is actively exploring options for a new-generation heavy-lift rotorcraft to replace the CH-47 Chinook. Although plans are still very much in their infancy, they have broader implications for future heavy-lift capabilities, especially for the Pacific theater. Confirmation that work on a Chinook successor is ongoing comes as the service progresses with its Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) tiltrotor, which will replace part of the UH-60 Black Hawk fleet, and after its cancelation of the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA), which would have partially replaced the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior armed scout helicopter, now retired without any plans for a direct successor. In response to a question from TWZ, Brig. Gen. Cain Baker, the director of the Future Vertical Lift Cross-Functional Team, or FVL CFT, at Army Futures Command, provided an update on Chinook replacement plans at the Association of the U.S. Army’s annual symposium yesterday. Within the Army, this is known as Capability Set, or 'Cape Set,' Four, part of the wider Future Vertical Lift (FVL) effort. FLRAA and FARA were responses to other FVL Capability Sets. Cap Set 4 also evolved in part from earlier efforts, including the Joint Heavy Lift (JHL) and Joint Multi-Role (JMR) programs. Future Vertical Lift Cross-Functional Team Director Brig. Gen. Cain Baker (center) at the 2024 iteration of the Experimental Demonstration Gateway Event (EDGE) at Yima Proving Ground earlier this year. Mark Schauer/U.S. Army It is important to note that Cape Set Four is not new and the Army announced the start of a new study into a potential Chinook replacement last year. 'We’ve done some initial studies on what a Cape Set Four looks like,' Brig. Gen. Baker explained. 'Those studies are still ongoing, very, very cognizant of the size of it, the type of lift capabilities we want from it, but also the affordability of that.' For Baker, Cape Set Four is very much a lower priority than FLRAA, which is anticipated to enter low-rate initial production in 2028 after which units will start to use them operationally in 2030. Concept artwork of the U.S. Army’s Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) tiltrotor. Bell Textron Bell Baker continued: 'We will start looking eventually at Cape Set Four, as we get the feedback on what we see out in industry that’s available, and then, more importantly, does it potentially meet the requirements that we think we need.' Of those requirements, Baker listed longer range, heavier payload, and fuel efficiency. While Baker admitted that there is still 'a lot of work to do on Cape Set Four,' he also made clear that 'it is definitely out there on the horizon that we’ve got to look at.' In the meantime, the Army's Chinook fleet — which numbers more than 470 aircraft — will soldier on as the service's heavy-lift rotorcraft for many more years to come. This could be aided by the latest Chinook Block II upgrade program. This includes new rotor blades, a revised fuel tank configuration, and other improvements, while there is also a separate option to add more powerful General Electric T408 engines. So far, however, the Army has only bought them for its special operations units. The first picture of a CH-47, tail number 067, with the new T408 engines, which emerged in late 2019. U.S. Army 'We’re going to ride the Chinook like we’re riding the C-130' added Maj. Gen. Clair Gill, Commanding General at the U.S. Army Aviation Center of Excellence and Fort Novosel, also speaking at AUSA and referencing the Air Force’s long-lived turboprop transport plane. Nevertheless, the Army's determination to field a Chinook replacement at some point in the future is a notable turnaround, compared with previous comments. 'There is no plan right now for a Cape Set Four or Five and the Army has been pretty consistent in saying that' Gen. John Murray, then the commanding general of Army Futures Command, declared in May 2021. 'The FARA — Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft — and the Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft are the two plans, [or] programs, we have working right now. There is nothing working for a replacement for the CH-47.' The first Raider X competitive prototype for the now-canceled FARA program in a hangar at Sikorsky’s West Palm Beach, Florida, facility. Sikorsky The first Raider X competitive prototype in a hanger at Sikorsky’s West Palm Beach, Florida, facility. Sikorsky Photo While that plan has now changed, it’s likely that the current focus on FLRAA has highlighted the demand for greater speed and range in the vertical-lift domain, especially in the Pacific scenario. The Army is already preparing for the step-change in vertical-lift capability that the FLRAA promises to bring. This will include a new ability to conduct Large-Scale, Long-Range Air Assault, or L2A2, operations, defined by the ability to 'deliver one Brigade Combat Team in one period of darkness, over 500 miles, arriving behind enemy lines, and be able to conduct sustained combat operations,' Maj. Gen. Brett Sylvia, head of the 101st Airborne Division, said during a separate talk at AUSA. L2A2 currently relies upon a fast-flying tiltrotor to be realized, with the specific range and speed advantage of Bell’s V-280 Valor demonstrator very likely being a major factor behind its choice for FLRAA instead of Boeing’s rival SB>1 Defiant. FLRAA is derived from the V-280 design. How this does or doesn’t translate to a heavy-lift rotorcraft is an open question. There is no tiltrotor in this category currently flying or in development — although the idea has certainly been raised in the past — leaving a dearth of any kind of platform that can fulfill the Army’s Cape Set Four requirements. A concept from the Karem Aircraft Company shows a future heavy-lift tiltrotor, in the C-130 size category, schemed for the previous Joint Heavy Lift program, which also fed into Future Vertical Lift. Karem Aircraft Company rendering While the structural and performance enhancements introduced in the Chinook Block II program add speed and lift to an airframe design that’s now over 60 years old, the helicopter offers nothing close to FLRAA levels of performance. At the same time, Chinook Block II has always been seen as a stopgap until a replacement platform can be defined, a conundrum Cape Set Four is now grappling with. Other than the Chinook, the only other suitable heavy-lift rotorcraft currently in production is the CH-53K King Stallion, as operated by the U.S. Marine Corps.

U.S. Marine Corps photo by Lance Cpl. Meshaq Hylton This program has been anything but trouble-free, with issues during its development prompting a demand from Congress that the Marines examine potential alternatives, such as the Chinook. On top of the Chinook Block II, another potential stopgap solution for the Army would be to re-engine its CH-47 fleet with T408 engines. This would provide a significantly more capable helicopter, building on its speed, payload, and hot-and-high performance. The T408s engines each produce 7,500 shaft horsepower (shp), around 2,500 shp more than the T55-GA-714As on standard CH-47F models. In the past, the Army’s reluctance to re-engine its Chinooks — and to buy Block IIs for regular Army units — seemed to be driven, at least in part, by a stated desire to move beyond the venerable design and instead look toward fielding a new heavy-lift rotary-wing aircraft, something that has previously attracted pushback from Congress.

U.S. Army photo by Staff Sgt. Thomas Mort U.S. Army photo by Staff Sgt. Thomas Mort However, for some years now, there’s been a growing realization that today’s Chinook is not survivable enough in some scenarios for potential future conflicts with peer or near-peer adversaries. 'We needed a capability that could fly great distances at great speeds and penetrate, let’s say, a Russian air defense system,' Army Secretary Mark Esper told members of the House Appropriations Committee's defense subcommittee, back in 2019, defending Army plans to shift funds from the Chinook to future aircraft programs and modernization programs. 'The decision, I think, for the CH-47s for the conventional Army — what probably changed was, when the National Defense Strategy was issued, it told us to move away from counterinsurgency to high-intensity conflict,' Esper added. U.S. soldiers, assigned to 1st Combat Aviation Brigade, 1st Infantry Division, lift off in CH-47 Chinook helicopters prior to aerial gunnery training at the 7th Army Training Command's Grafenwoehr Training Area, Germany, Aug. 4, 2021. U.S. Army photo by Markus Rauchenberger U.S. Chinooks practice aerial gunnery training in Germany. U.S. Army photo by Markus Rauchenberger That means switching to advanced aircraft like the FLRAA tiltrotor and — until its cancelation — FARA, which emphasize high speed and long range as well as other measures to enhance their over survivability. The survivability question, in general, is one that has consistently been raised about rotorcraft of all types, especially when it comes to future high-end fights. In the meantime, the dense air defense environment faced by tactical aircraft — including rotorcraft — in Ukraine has demonstrated the vulnerability of traditional platforms even when exposed to older-generation threats. Along with concerns over rotorcraft survivability is the interest expressed by the Army (as well as the Marine Corps and Air Force) in distributed logistics chains, leveraging, at least in part, increasingly large uncrewed aerial cargo platforms. This could also raise questions about whether a new heavy-lift platform is necessary or cost-effective. A video showing the Kaman KARGO drone, one of the uncrewed aerial cargo designs the Marine Corps is currently considering acquiring. Another uncrewed option for future heavy-lift, vertical-lift requirements might be found in a fan-in-wing vertical take-off-and-landing capable type. Earlier this month, we reported on how Aurora Flight Sciences is working on a demonstrator aircraft in this category, as well as a scaled-up cargo aircraft based on the same technology. The demonstrator is being developed under a U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) program and reflects Air Force interest in a new high-speed, runway-independent special operations transport plane. If this concept actually comes to fruition and is operationally viable, it would provide a C-130-like payload with VTOL capability, and, even though it likely would not be procured by the Army, it could assume aspects of the mission set for the service. An Aurora Flight Sciences rendering of an uncrewed fan-in-wing VTOL-capable cargo aircraft. Aurora Flight Sciences Looking further ahead, the need for higher-performance vertical lift could potentially be provided by some kind of High-Speed Vertical Take-Off and Landing, or HSVTOL, aircraft. This is a concept that Bell is meanwhile has been working on, including now as part of the same DARPA program that Aurora's lift fan design is under development for. While this kind of aircraft promises to combine the ability to take off and land vertically using rotors as well as fly at jet speeds in forward flight, it is still very much in its infancy and significant hurdles — especially as regards the nature of the propulsion system — still need to be overcome. Bell’s latest three HSVTOL concepts are progressively larger, beginning with the smallest, known as HSVTOL Light, which is unmanned and scaling up to a roughly C-130-size transport. Bell The experience with FARA demonstrates just how quickly Army requirements can change and be superseded. With upgrades to ensure it remains relevant, the Chinook will be at the center of Army airlift for decades to come, but service officials are now talking openly about the need for a successor, even if that might not emerge until around the 2060s. With very few options, beyond more Chinooks, which don’t appear to meet long-term requirements, an all-new design currently looks almost certain. Rachel S. Cohen contributed to this story.

Secretive Phoenix Ghost Kamikaze Drones Rushed To Ukraine Finally...	The secretive Phoenix Ghost kamikaze drone, first developed for the U.S. Air Force and supplied to Ukraine in its ongoing fight against Russia, has finally emerged publicly. We now know for sure that Phoenix Ghost is not a single design, but a family of increasingly larger and longer-ranged one-way attack munitions from AEVEX Aerospace, some of which have been seen before, while at least one was only revealed this week. AEVEX confirmed the connection between various kamikaze drones it offers and the Phoenix Ghost effort at the Association of the U.S. Army’s (AUSA) main annual symposium in Washington, D.C., this week. The Pentagon first announced Phoenix Ghost kamikaze drones provided by AEVEX would be headed to Ukraine back in 2022, but scant information about them had subsequently emerged before now. Disruptor, one of the AEVEX kamikaze drones now known to be part of the Phoenix Ghost family. Jamie Hunter 'It’s been a long time coming,' Elizabeth Trammell, senior director of business development at AEVEX, told TWZ Tuesday. 'This has been around for a while … We’ve been able to receive specific permission to talk about it.' The Phoenix Ghost family of one-way attack munitions includes types with distinctly different forms and performance capabilities. At least some of the designs were derived from aerial targets that AEVEX originally developed for testing counter-drone systems, according to the company. Phoenix Ghosts were among the first kamikaze drones the U.S. military publicly announced it would be sending to Ukraine, but it had not been previously confirmed what they were and no conclusive imagery showing one had emerged before now. It is worth noting that the development of the Phoenix Ghost family, which traces back to a project under the Air Force's Big Safari special projects office, also predates Russia's all-out invasion of Ukraine in 2022. As such, AEVEX was very much ahead in the United States in working on one-way-attack drones, in general. I find it odd that with all the imagery and video pouring out of Ukraine of virtually every weapon system before, action, in action, or after action, we have yet to see a single confirmed image of a Phoenix Ghost suicide drone/loitering munition.&mdash; Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) July 25, 2022 All 'AEVEX loitering munitions use visual-based navigation to autonomously identify and follow landmarks or features in their environment, enabling precise positioning and pathfinding without reliance on GPS,' according to the company's website. 'Our systems leverage alternative PNT [precision navigation and timing] solutions to maintain precise navigation and operational capability in GPS-denied or degraded environments.' In addition, 'AEVEX loitering munitions automatically detect, identify, locate, report (DILR) and deliver lethal and non-lethal effects against threats across multiple scenarios and domains with unprecedented accuracy and speed' and are able to 'navigate, make decisions, and complete missions without direct intervention,' the company says. However, the drones can also be fitted with line-of-sight links and/or mesh networked radios, as well as electro-optical and infrared sensors, to provide some degree of direct control. In addition to acting as kamikaze drones, AEVEX says the uncrewed aerial systems in its product line can be configured for electronic and cyber warfare and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Among the specific kamikaze drones AEVEX has now disclosed as being part of the Phoenix Ghost family are Dominator and Disruptor, which are in the so-called Group 3 category. The U.S. military defines Group 3 drones as weighing between 55 and 1,320 pounds, being able to fly at altitudes between 3,500 and 18,000 feet, and having top speeds of between 100 and 250 knots. While the Dominator was previously disclosed, Disruptor was only publicly unveiled this week. Disruptor, which has a tubular carbon fiber main body, a pair of straight main wings, and a v-tail configuration, is 10.1 feet long and has a wingspan of 15.75 feet. It has a maximum takeoff weight of 185 pounds when launched pneumatically, but this can be increased to 205 pounds by using a rocket-assisted launch method. AEVEX also states that the Disruptor can be vehicle-launched, but has not provided any further details. Powered by a small internal combustion engine driving a two-bladed pusher propeller, Disruptor can stay aloft for 4.5 hours and fly out to a maximum range of at least 372 miles (598 kilometers) with a 50-pound payload. The company also offers a version using electronic fuel injection (EFI), increasing its endurance to 11.6 hours and extending its range out to 822 miles (1,322 kilometers). Disruptor's engine and propeller. Jamie Hunter Disruptor is interestingly similar, at least in very broad strokes, to kamikaze drones that Iran has developed or helped its proxies develop, such as the Shahed 101. AEVEX says the Group 3 Dominator is dimensionally identical to Disruptor in terms of overall length and wingspan, but it has a completely different twin-boom configuration with an inverted v-shaped tailplane. This a very common configuration for drones in this general size class, with the RQ-7 Shadow, which the U.S. Army announced plans to retire in Febraury, being just one example. There is also the Aerosonde family, versions of which remain in service with the U.S. special operations community. Other twin boom drones with v-shaped and straight tailplanes, including ones made in China, are also in widespread use globally. The Dominator drone. AEVEX Dominator has maximum takeoff weights of 205 and 225 pounds when launched pneumatically or in a rocket-assisted mode, respectively. With a similar, if not identical propulsion system to Disruptor, Dominator has maximum endurances of 4.6 and 11.7 hours and ranges of 293 and 743 miles (492 and 1,196 kilometers) with and without EFI. A Dominator drone on a pneumatic launcher. AEVEX The Phoenix Ghost family also includes a smaller Group 2 drone called Atlas, another design that AEVEX has previously shown publicly. Per the U.S. military definitions, uncrewed aerial systems in this category weigh between 21 and 55 pounds, can fly at altitudes up to 3,500 feet, and attain top speeds of up to 250 knots. The Atlas, which has what looks to be pop-out main wings and v-tail, has a maximum takeoff weight of 20.9 pounds, including an 8.1-pound payload, and is 2.9 feet long and has a wingspan of 5.5 feet, per AEVEX's website. Its stated endurance is between one and two hours, with a maximum range of at least 74 miles (120 kilometers). How Atlas is powered is not immediately clear, but it has a pusher propeller at the rear. The Atlas drone. AEVEX At AUSA this week, AEVEX had a product card detailing another drone called Dagger, which also does not appear to have been previously disclosed and looks to be a Group 2 analog to Disruptor. It is unclear whether the electrically powered Dagger is technically part of the Phoenix Ghost family or is a design that followed on from that work. Dagger is six feet long and has a wingspan of 8.7 feet, has a maximum takeoff weight of 35 pounds (including an eight-pound payload), and can fly for up to 80 minutes and out to a range of 120 miles (193 kilometers). A picture of the rendering of the Dagger drone seen on the AEVEX product card at AUSA. Jamie Hunter Dagger is designed to make it easier for troops to 'move in, get out, set up, shoot off, and … get out of there,' AEVEX's Trammell explained to TWZ at AUSA. AEVEX's Trammel also said that the Phoenix Ghost family encompasses multiple other assets that the company is keeping under wraps for now. The company is also continuing to evolve its product line, in part based on experiences from the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. AEVEX uses a two-week design cycle to let the company quickly respond to new threats and conditions troops encounter on the ground. 'We've learned a lot,' Trammell said. 'This [Distruptor] does not look anywhere near what it was when we first put it out.' The nose cone has changed, she said, as has the color. She indicated the colors have evolved to better camouflage the weapons around the clock. Ukrainian officials notably began highlighting Russia's use of black or otherwise darkly painted kamikaze drones, and that this had made it difficult to visually spot and track them, especially at night, last year. Ukraine has since been observed employing kamikaze drones with similar paint schemes. Another view of the Disruptor drone on the floor of this year's AUSA show, highlighting its dark paint job. Jamie Hunter As the war in Ukraine grinds through its third year, Trammell also expects demand will grow for the drones to collect more intelligence and play a larger role in electronic warfare. AEVEX is also known to be looking at enhancing Phoenix Ghost’s resistance to GPS jamming, something that has been a significant problem in Ukraine, for both drones and guided munitions. The company says its acquisition of Veth Research Associates should see that company’s guidance and navigation technology inserted into Phoenix Ghost drones, according to Aviation Week. When it comes to Ukraine, it remains unclear what types of Phoenix Ghost drones the country has received to date and how they are specifically configured in terms of payloads and guidance capabilities. To date, the U.S. military has pledged at least 1,800 Phoenix Ghosts to Ukraine. The U.S. military said had obligated approximately $576 million for the purchase of drones in this family from AEVEX for the Ukrainian armed forces through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI), as of August. AEVEX was shipping around 230 loitering munitions each month at the height of its deliveries, and is still delivering fresh weapons every two weeks, Trammell told TWZ. Back in April 2022, then-top Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby did say that the Phoenix Ghost drones Ukraine was getting had similar, 'but not [the] exact,' capabilities as the AeroVironment Switchblade 300 tube-launched loitering munition, which could point to the smaller Atlas or Dagger. However, officials added at that time that there are differences 'in the scope of capability for the Phoenix Ghost.' Another view of the Atlas drone. AEVEX Kirby's statement is one of a number of signs that had emerged before this year's AUSA gathering pointing to Phoenix Ghost actually being a family of drones and that Ukraine had received multiple types, something David Hambling just explored in more detail for Forbes last month. 'It’s a system of systems that varies in range and payload and type,' Skip Arny, a Vice President at Aevex Aerospace, also said about Phoenix Ghost at the AUSA show in 2022, according to Defense News. 'It’s a great example of a quick-reaction capability, and we basically got a request to put a system together, and that’s what it is.' Just this summer, pictures also began to emerge of a drone design that had not been previously observed in use by Ukraine, which independent defense analyst H.I. Sutton noted on his website Covert Shores looked similar if not identical to the AEVEX Dominator. Questions have been raised about whether these drones are actually Dominators or are a local derivative or clone of some kind given that they were reportedly recovered in Russia. The U.S. government has, at least from what is known publicly to date, placed significant restrictions on the use of American-supplied munitions against targets inside Russian territory, but various exceptions and caveats are also known to exist. Drones can stray from their intended flight paths for various reasons, too. Ukraine's arsenal of longer-range kamikaze drones has otherwise steadily expanded in the past two years, predominantly through the fielding of new domestically developed types. The wreckage of a one-way attack drone — which looks to be the Dominator, or a derivative of it — used to attack Russia earlier this year. via X Not knowing what kinds of Phoenix Ghost drones Ukraine has or how they are configured, it is also unclear what kinds of target sets the drones are being employed against. 'We haven’t really gotten into anti-tank or anti-armor, just because it’s not been a requirement for us,' AEVEX's senior director of business development Trammell told TWZ at AUSA this week. 'A lot of our aircraft, we had the base capability and then our customers came in and said, ‘This is what we want.’' Trammell's mention of 'customers' plural also raises questions about who else may have received Phoenix Ghost drones. As of June, AEVEX had reportedly delivered 4,000 drones under U.S. military contracts, well beyond the 1,800 Phoenix Ghosts publicly committed to Ukraine through USAI. It is certainly possible that the Ukrainian military has received more Phoenix Ghosts than is publicly known, but demand for various tiers of kamikaze drones is also growing globally. Earlier this year, the U.S. government approved the potential sale of more than 1,000 kamikaze drones, a mix of Switchblade 300 and ALTIUS 600M types, to Taiwan. That comes amid broader U.S. military plans to help the island turn the airspace and waters around it into a 'hellscape' full of uncrewed platforms in the event of an invasion from the mainland, as you can read more about here. The now routine use of multiple tiers of kamikaze drones in the conflict in Ukraine has helped push the Taiwan 'hellscape' plans forward and is also driving efforts across the U.S. military to acquire and field these types of uncrewed aerial systems. Last year, the Pentagon kicked off an initiative dubbed Replicator specifically with the goal of helping get thousands of new and relatively cheap uncrewed platforms with high degrees of autonomy into the hands of U.S. forces across all domains by 2025. In August, the Army awarded an especially massive contract valued at nearly $1 billion to AeroVironment for Switchblade 300 and 600-series drones, which is now the subject of a formal protest. 'There are a lot of companies in this space, so Switchblades are one of our first efforts here, but it's not going to be our last or our only one,' Doug Bush, the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology, told TWZ and other outlets at a media roundtable on the sidelines of the AUSA conference this week. 'I think you will see soon a diversity of companies getting contracts for that kind capability. It's a really healthy part of industry. We don't have, like, just one place to go.' Each branch of the U.S. armed forces — particularly the Army and Air Force — has been interested 'in some way, shape or form' in AEVEX's product line, Trammell told TWZ. Furthermore, 'as the conflict [in Ukraine] dwindles, there's other opportunities that this can go for,' she said. 'There's a lot of big programs that are looking for midsize UAS systems, and we're trying to advertise to that.' Still, the experience AEVEX has now gained from working on the now less-secretive Phoenix Ghost effort for Ukraine could give the company an important leg up as kamikaze drones continue to make their mark worldwide.

B-2 Spirits Just Sent A Very Ominous Message To Iran	The Pentagon is stating that B-2 Spirit stealth bombers, along with other U.S. forces, conducted a strike on Houthi underground weapon storage sites in Yemen. This it the first operational strike mission for the Spirit in years and the first into Yemen. It sends a very specific and powerful message that only B-2 can to the Houthi's benefactor, Iran. It also occurred on what appears to be the precipice of an unprecedented Israeli retaliation strike. As to why the B-2 was used against the Houthis, who have only rudimentary air defenses, we will address in a moment, but it was by design a very ominous and potentially historic act that might have featured the first use of an incredibly rare weapon. Even if it did not, the message was the same. The Pentagon's statement reads: 'Today, U.S. military forces, including U.S. Air Force B-2 bombers, conducted precision strikes against five hardened underground weapons storage locations in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. U.S. forces targeted several of the Houthis' underground facilities housing various weapons components of types that the Houthis have used to target civilian and military vessels throughout the region. This was a unique demonstration of the United States' ability to target facilities that our adversaries seek to keep out of reach, no matter how deeply buried underground, hardened, or fortified. The employment of U.S. Air Force B-2 Spirit long-range stealth bombers demonstrate U.S. global strike capabilities to take action against these targets when necessary, anytime, anywhere. For over a year, the Iran-backed Houthis, Specially Designated Global Terrorists, have recklessly and unlawfully attacked U.S. and international vessels transiting the Red Sea, the Bab Al-Mandeb Strait, and the Gulf of Aden. The Houthis' illegal attacks continue to disrupt the free flow of international commerce, threaten environmental catastrophe, and put innocent civilian lives and U.S. and partner forces' lives at risk. At the direction of President Biden, I authorized these targeted strikes to further degrade the Houthis' capability to continue their destabilizing behavior and to protect and defend U.S. forces and personnel in one of the world's most critical waterways. Again, the United States will not hesitate to take action to defend American lives and assets; to deter attacks against civilians and our regional partners; and to protect freedom of navigation and increase the safety and security in these waterways for U.S., coalition, and merchant vessels. We will continue to make clear to the Houthis that there will be consequences for their illegal and reckless attacks. I am grateful for the professionalism and skill of the brave American troops who took part in today's actions and who continue to stand guard in defense of our Nation.' The DoD's description of the targets is very important. 'Hardened underground weapons storage locations,' followed by declaring 'the United States' ability to target facilities that our adversaries seek to keep out of reach, no matter how deeply buried underground, hardened, or fortified.' This directly highlights the B-2's special ability to carry out unique penetrating 'bunker buster' strikes, specifically via its ability to carry the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, better known as the MOP. Although it isn't clear if this weapon was used, it's certainly possible for a number of reasons, and that is really all that matters. The MOP, weighing in around 30,000lbs, can only be carried by the B-2. Two can be lugged aloft by each of the stealth bombers at a time. These are highly specialized and prized weapons only available in relatively tiny numbers. MOP is able to penetrate deeper than any other conventional bomb on earth and is specifically designed and has been repeatedly upgraded to go after deeply buried, high-value targets, especially those in Iran. These sites include command and control centers and missile storage and launch facilities, as well as aircraft storage areas, tunneled into mountains. But above all else, the MOP's top targets would be extremely hardened sites related to Iran's nuclear program. This is a reality we have been discussing for many years and in detail. Even with the MOP, they will be a challenge to destroy, but anything short of a nuclear weapon, ground invasion, or use of an 'exotic' tactic like irradiation, the MOPs have the best shot at severely damaging these facilities and degrading their utility over the long term. Iran's Natanz nuclear site burrowed in a mountain.(PHOTO © 2023 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION) The Houthis also have high-value sites dug into mountains. They are not nearly as advanced as those found in Iran, and while hitting weak points, support areas, and entrances may degrade their utility, truly destroying them may very well necessitate the MOP's special penetrating abilities. Even if the target set didn't require it, a demonstration of MOP's capabilities — if it was indeed used — may have been a strategic messaging decision, but more about that in a moment. The Houthis are going underground. In 2019, the movement seems to have reactivated a Saleh-era underground facility at Hafa military base in Sanaa, which had been destroyed by coalition airstrikes back in 2015. (15.325075° 44.239581°) pic.twitter.com/g4Ep5CltEX&mdash; Fabian Hinz (@fab_hinz) March 14, 2021 The timing of such a strike makes perfect sense as it happened just as the tension between Israel and Iran is about to hit uncharted territory as the world awaits what is by all indications going to be a significant strike by Israel directly on Iran. Sending a very direct reminder that the U.S. has the ability to destroy extremely hardened sites with conventional weapons and it is willing to use them seems right on cue in terms of deterrence theater. This is only magnified if MOP was indeed used for the first time. In fact, MOP-related news often peculiarly pops-up during times of escalation with America's 'rogue state' foes, although a demonstration of operational use has never occurred. Regardless, striking these sites with any munitions also degrades the Houthi's long-range capabilities ahead of an Israeli operation, which is important. The B-2 also has the ability to deliver Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) with penetrating warheads in the 2,000-pound class (BLU-109), as well as, at least in the past, 5,000-pound class bunker busters, the latter being a much rarer weapon the exact status of which in the B-2's inventory is unclear. You can read more about this class of weapon's origins here and murky status here. A very early graphic from the MOP program showing the bomb able to penetrate up to 60 feet under the ground. By 2007, the weapon was reportedly capable of burrowing nearly four times deeper than this. This also offers a comparison between the 2,000lb BLU-109-equipped guided bomb and 5,000lb GBU-28. DOD via GlobalSecurity.org The B-2 is capable of carrying 16 of the 2,000lb class weapons, allowing it to 'dig down' through hardened targets that do not necessitate a MOP by having one weapon follow through the hole made by the one that just struck before it and so on. It is creative 'weaponeering' that allows for lesser bunker busters to achieve greater burrowing effects. Even the MOP could use this tactic for striking very deeply buried targets, like some of those in Iran. Otherwise disabling sites by going after entrance tunnels and other weaker, but less centralized areas may be an option. GBU-31 JDAMs equipped with BLU-109 penetrator warheads. (USAF) But if common 2,000lb bunker busters were used, why leverage the B-2, a precious asset of which only 19 exist, on targets that sit under airspace that is barely defended? There are a number of reasons for this that we already addressed after the Spirit was selected to strike targets in Libya in 2017. You can read that post here. But once again, the messaging related to the B-2 and its ability to penetrate deep into contested airspace to deliver a highly specialized weapon that threatens Iran's most guarded military and nuclear assets is the most glaring reason. We will have to wait to find out exactly what was stuck and how, but as it sits now, this mission was far more than just an attack operation to achieve a kinetic effect. It was meant to send a blindingly bright message to Iran at a critically high-risk and pivotal moment.

Command Center Stryker Teamed With Uncrewed Ground Vehicle ‘Wingm...	General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) unveiled a new Mission Command On The Move (MCOTM) concept and its supporting hardware at the Association of the United States Army's biggest annual conference (AUSA '24), which wrapped up today outside of Washington, D.C. The idea is to take an advanced command center filled with communications and a crew that can interpret critical data and make fast decisions, pack it all into a nimble armored vehicle, and push it forward toward the edge of battle along with an array of uncrewed ground vehicles (UGVs) also under its control. This concept appears to aim to accomplish a couple of key objectives. First, it makes a command and control node more nimble, protected, and thus far more survivable on a modern battlefield. Fixed command centers, which often have a major footprint and the multi-spectral signatures that go with it, are more vulnerable than ever, especially as precision-guided missile and drone technology proliferate at an alarming space. So allowing it to reposition rapidly, and even keep up with the forces it supports, is seen as an attractive capability. There is also a major logistics burden when it comes to establishing, breaking down, and repositioning traditional command centers in tents and trailers. The other is to allow this mobile C2 node to also control an array of UGVs that can work in a defensive manner, protecting the command center and friendly forces, and even in an offensive one. Seeing as the C2 node is armored, deeply networked, and highly mobile, it could stay in relatively close proximity to at least some of the UGVs it controls, allowing for line-of-sight connectivity between them. The UGVs can provide direct fire, reconnaissance, air defense, and additional transport capabilities. This kind of manned-unmanned teaming armored ecosystem is very much the direction the Army is interested in heading in the coming years. Central to this concept is the 8&#215;8 Mission Command On The Move (MCOTM) armored vehicle, which is based on the StrykerX demonstrator. This rolling battlefield management node works as a forward brain for friendly forces and a quarterback for the aforementioned UGVs even in hotly contested areas. The General Dynamics Land Systems Stryker Mission Command On The Move (MCOTM) command vehicle. (General Dynamics Land Systems) Like the StrykerX, which was unveiled at the AUSA show in 2022, the Stryker MCOTM system features hybrid-electric propulsion. This also builds on a previous StrykerQB concept that was rolled out for AUSA conference last year. Painted like a football uniform, it was displayed to show the Army 'the 'art of the possible' when it comes to using existing platforms for manned-unmanned teaming, or human-machine integration,' Breaking Defense reported at the time. The earlier StrykerQB vehicle. (General Dynamics Land Systems) The new Stryker MCOTM is another step forward in that development. With increased interior space thanks to a raised rear roof, it has room for seven soldiers. The command vehicle uses GDLS's KATALYST Next Generation Electronic Architecture (NGEA) to connect all its systems together and provide for ease of upgradability of its hardware and modification of its software. That enables the vehicle to adapt more quickly to changing tactical realities and technologies. The NGEA system offers 'cyber defense, and individual communication devices for end-to-end secure communications, at echelon,' the company states. 'Integrating innovative intra-command post communications helps substantively reduce electromagnetic signatures, enabling the MCOTM command post to 'hide in plain sight.'' Extra attention has been put on reducing the vehicle's signature beyond the radio frequency spectrum, including thermal and acoustic. The vehicle's hybrid propulsion helps with both. For self-protection, the Stryker MCOTM showcased on the showroom floor features the Iron Fist Light active protection system. The system is designed to shoot down approaching anti-tank guided missiles and other infantry anti-armor weapons, and could be used to also swat down incoming kamikaze drones and drone-launched projectiles in the near future. GDLS has shown the Stryker MCOTM paired with the newest version of the company's 8&#215;8 Multi-Utility Tactical Transport (MUTT) robotic vehicle, known as the MUTT XM, and the latest iteration of its TRX Defender, a 10-ton modular tracked robotic vehicle that can be configured to provide ground and air defense fire support. At AUSA this year, GDLS also highlighted MUTT XM as a robot dog carrier vehicle, capable of releasing and retrieving these mechanical and potentially deadly quadrupeds in forward areas. They can also be used for outer security around the MCOTM. At AUSA, the specific robot dog shown together with the MUTT XM was a Ghost Robotics Vision 60 quadrupedal UGV (Q-UGV), a design The War Zone has covered extensively in the past. This particular Vision 60 was carrying MIMIC spoofing technology from General Dynamics Mission Systems, 'providing a deployed layer of protection for the MCOTM command vehicles,' according to the company. A key part of our Mission Command on the Move (MCOTM) concept at AUSA 2024 is the MUTT XM, the newest member of our family of Multi-Utility Tactical Transport robotic vehicles.MUTT XM is bigger, faster and stronger than its predecessors and is hardened against electromagnetic… pic.twitter.com/7MLtXYW0Xm&mdash; General Dynamics Land Systems (@GD_LandSystems) October 15, 2024 The MUTT XM by itself 'is bigger, faster, and stronger than its predecessors and is hardened against electromagnetic interference,' GDLS stated in a release. It 'lightens the load as an equipment-carrying 'robotic mule' but also has built-in flexibility for a wide variety of combat, combat support, and combat service support functions and payloads.'

(Jamie Hunter) The Army has been experimenting with versions of the MUTT vehicle for a while, something we noted in February 2022. In an opposition forces exercise, the 8×8 wheeled, hybrid-electric-powered uncrewed ground vehicles (UGV) were each configured with a Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS) equipped with a 7.62mm M240 machine gun and a Javelin anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) launcher. It also had a tethered quadcopter drone with an array of video cameras allowing it to provide additional surveillance and reconnaissance capacity, as well as act as a signal relay. That extends how far the MUTT can operate from its human operators. You can see one example of that configuration in the image below. An 8&#215;8 Multi-Utility Tactical Transport (MUTT) as seen during a 2022 demonstration. (U.S. Army) TRX, which GDLS had first unveiled at the AUSA gathering in 2020, is a tracked semi-autonomous vehicle with a flat deck that can be configured in numerous ways, including for direct and indirect fire, autonomous resupply, complex obstacle breaching, counter-unmanned aerial systems (C-UAS), electronic warfare (EW), reconnaissance, and other battlefield missions. The core design was developed to meet the Army's need for a 10- to 20-ton UGV. That vehicle was the company’s submission to the Army’s Robotic Combat Vehicle-Medium (RCV-M) competition that Howe & Howe ultimately won with its M5. The General Dynamics Land Systems TRX in a SHORAD configuration. (Jamie Hunter) Another view of the SHORAD-configured TRX. (Jamie Hunter) As seen above and below, the TRX on display at AUSA this year was mocked up as a short-range air defense (SHORAD) system with faux Stinger short-range heat-seeking surface-to-air missiles, Coyote anti-drone interceptors, a 30mm automatic cannon, and a 7.62x51mm machine gun. This is an impressive and diverse loadout for a relatively small tracked vehicle. Vehicles that are capable of rebuffing drone attacks, are armored, and can keep up with frontline forces are becoming a growing priority for the U.S. Army and this is clearly a major business growth area for industry. Having just such a vehicle to protect the manned command and control Stryker that could operate detached from forward forces is also key. (Jamie Hunter) Another version of TRX we wrote about in 2021 was set up as a launch platform for 50 AeroVironment Switchblade-series loitering munitions. Such a configuration could venture forward and launch a devastating drone swarm at the command of the MCOTM. The General Dynamics Land Systems TRX configured as Switchblade launch platform on display at the 2021 AUSA conference. (Joseph Trevithick) www.twz.com The Army is increasingly looking to integrate UGVs with its crewed armored formation on the battlefield. Similar to how the USAF wants its Next Generation Air Dominance manned 'fighter' to be the centerpiece of a family of systems that will be dominated by uncrewed types, working as the central C2 node 'quarterback' for these drones, GDLS is presenting a similar concept for ground operations. Moving the controller forward not only helps with connectivity and awareness, but also allows for deficiencies in autonomy to be overcome by proximity. Advances in autonomy will change those relationships over time, but this kind of on-the-move management will be important at least in the near term as the U.S. military has stressed that having humans at least somewhere 'on-the-loop' is a requisite for uncrewed platforms. As far as the MCOTM's more traditional command and control functions, those are not clear, but even possessing some of these abilities and being able to keep them on the move and forward while flanked by a protective phalanx of UGVs is an enticing concept to ponder. Another view of the Stryker MCOTM on display at this year's AUSA show. Jamie Hunter Regardless of whether this system fills this role for the Army or anyone else, the general concept behind it is something we're going to be seeing more of in the coming years.

Army’s Future Vertical Lift Tiltrotor Will Differ Significantly F...	The U.S. Army's Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) tiltrotor is shaping up to be significantly different from the V-280 Valor from which it is derived. Changes range from the design of the drive train to the fuselage layout to the arrangement of the seats inside the main cabin. The service's goal is to have the initial FLRAA configuration largely nailed down by next year and development work is already informing exploration of how the new aircraft will be used operationally. Army officials provided new details about the FLRAA program at a panel discussion today at the Association of the U.S. Army's (AUSA) main annual conference in Washington, D.C. The service picked Bell and its V-280-based design as the winner of the FLRAA competition in 2022. A so-called Critical Design Review (CDR) is expected to occur next summer ahead of the planned delivery of the first of six FLRAA prototypes in 2026. The program schedule as it exists now sees low-rate initial production of the tiltrotors starting in 2028 and units beginning to use them operationally in 2030. Bell 'To be very clear, and that's why I very rarely use the term V-280 for FLRAA, the name of the aircraft will be different, the nomenclature will be different, the changes are significant,' Army Col. Jeffrey Poquette, the head of the program on the Army side, explained at AUSA. 'The drive train has already been upsized to meet the purposes and intent for meeting our requirements.' In terms of general performance, requirements the Army previously laid out publicly for FLRAA called for a design capable of hitting a top speed of at least 250 knots (285 miles per hour), and potentially up to 280 knots (320 miles per hour), and with an unrefueled combat radius of between 200 and 300 nautical miles. In testing to date, the experimental V-280, which has been flying since 2017, has reached a top speed of over 300 knots. The stated maximum speed and range of a typical current-generation Black Hawk under normal operating conditions is around 163 knots (187.5 miles per hour) and 268 nautical miles, respectively, according to Lockheed Martin, the parent company of the helicopter's manufacturer Sikorsky. The Army has also said in the past that it wants FLRAA to be able to carry 12 passengers, 4,000 pounds, or a mix of both, internally, as well as between 10,000 pounds and 13,100 pounds of additional cargo slung underneath the fuselage. FLRAA is also expected to have the ability to carry munitions and other stores on stub wings just like Black Hawk variants and the exact configuration of sensors, antennas and other systems will need to be finalized, as well. A future special operations-focused subvariant is set to have other specialized features, too, including aerial refueling capability. FLRAA will have other notable internal and external differences compared to the V-280. 'Something as simple as, will we have cockpit doors? The answer is no. But the Valor does,' Col. Poquette added. 'We've already decided that the original [boarding] step [into the main cabin] was a little too narrow.' 'The things that matter to soldiers in the back are not drive trains or engines or rotors. What matters to them [are things like] is my seat comfortable? Does my ruck[sack] have to sit on my toes when I'm trying to get out? Am I going to trip over the guy in front of me?' the FLRAA program head continued. 'So we spend a lot of time early trying to get the insight from the people that matter to us.' Poquette highlighted experimentation utilizing a wooden FLRAA mock-up earlier this year at Wheeler Army Airfield in Hawaii earlier this year that involved personnel from the 25th Infantry Division as having provided key feedback. 'We spent a week out there with them [the members of the 25th Infantry Division], iterating on the two [internal] configurations we wanted to test. We started with one, the one actually that we thought we were going to choose with [regard to] seat configuration,' Poquette said. 'We ran the soldiers through [drills]&#8230; without any combat gear, and then we added weapons, then we added body armor, then we added MOPP gear. We timed them.' MOPP is the U.S. military's suite of Mission Oriented Protective Posture protective gear, which includes gas masks and full body suits designed to help shield soldiers from chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear hazards. MOPP gear is notoriously physically straining to wear, especially in extremely hot and humid environments. A member of the 25th Infantry Division carrying their weapon and other gear exits the FLRAA mockup during testing at Wheeler Army Airfield in Hawaii in September 2024. US Army Spc. Charles Clark 'The people that do this kind of human systems science are technical experts, We measured every soldier with giant human-sized calipers,' Poquette continued. 'We wanted to make sure we could take care of the fifth percentile soldier, the 95th percent percentile soldier. 'We ran it [the tests] at combat speed &#8230; even as the soldiers came out, they ran out, they went into the prone with their weapon, so it was as tactical as we could make it while getting the information that we need,' he added.' 'What we found out is that soldiers really liked the second configuration better,' the FLRAA program chief said. 'Why did they like it? It was more comfortable, it was faster. They weren't tripping over each other.' Work on the internal configuration is not just limited to the arrangements of the passenger seats. There is the matter of where crew chiefs and other crew members will sit, as well as the positioning of weapons for self-defense. As seen below, the mock-ups the Army used in the tests in Hawaii had a crew-operated 7.62x51mm M240H machine gun mounted in a window on the side of the fuselage similar to the arrangement on the service's existing Black Hawks. US Army Spc. Charles Clark Poquette said today that the configuration of the controls and other features in the FLRAA's cockpit will also be different compared to how things are laid out on the V-280. The Army has been conducting other similar testing with units beyond the 25th Infantry Division. Other experimentation to help lay the groundwork for the future fielding of the FLRAA is already well underway, as you can read more about here. A so-called 'virtual prototype' has been helping personnel get a more hands-on look at FLRAA even before the first real aircraft is built. 'A virtual prototype is similar to a simulator, to the average person it is a simulator, but it's a little more fidelity than that,' according to Col. Poquette. 'It really involves using the software that is going to be in the aircraft, coupling that with a model, or what we call a dynamics model, of how the aircraft flies and how it reacts to conditions and inputs.' As can be seen in the picture below from the testing involving the mock-up earlier this in Hawaii, the Army has also been using augmented reality to give personnel a more in-depth experience so they can provide better feedback. US Army Spc. Charles Clark All of the initial FLRAA user testing and experimentation is particularly important given that the FLRAA is set to be the first-ever operational tiltrotor aircraft in the U.S. Army's inventory and is expected to be a major transformational moment in its history. This will require the service's pilots, especially, to learn entirely new skills sets and concepts of operations. 'How do I do an air assault with an aircraft that's going nearly 300 knots? That's something that Army aviators have never done before&#8230; as far as I know. It's a different mindset,' Poquette explained. 'We are helicopter pilots. &#8230; it's [FLRAA] only a helicopter for like takeoff and land. That's the whole point.' 'The Marine Corps does this. The Air Force Special Operations [Command] does. So we spend a lot of time with them on the program,' he continued. 'I know there is a plan to familiarize Army rotary pilots [with tiltrotors]. We have the V-22, the V-22 is a tiltrotor. So I've already started meeting Army aviators who have experience in the V-22. I just hired an experimental test pilot who is qualified in the V-22. So we're starting to build up the familiarity with a technology that the Army is just not really using.' A US Air Force Special Operations Command CV-22 Osprey. USAF A stock picture of a US Air Force CV-22B Osprey. USAF Bell, together with Boeing, developed the V-22 Osprey, which continues to be a controversial aircraft with a complicated track record. This was underscored by a fatal crash last year that led to virtually all of those aircraft being grounded for some three months. Work is still underway to address the root causes of that mishap and get Marine, Navy, and Air Force V-22 fleets back to their prior operational tempos. The V-280 and the FLRAA derived from it are clean-sheet Bell developments that differ greatly from the Osprey, as The War Zone has explored in detail before. The Army has also previously said that it is already looking toward future FLRAA variants with new and improved capabilities. The service has long touted its key demand that FLRAA use a modular open-architecture approach as making it easier to integrate new systems and functionality onto the aircraft in the future, something that officials at AUSA reiterated today. High-fidelity modeling and other digital engineering tools are also being actively employed now to help refine the baseline FLRAA design. The U.S. military continues to put heavy emphasis on digital engineering, especially in helping to avoid potentially costly issues down the road, despite growing internal and external assessments that the value of these techniques has at least been over-hyped. 'One of the things I try to impress upon people is budgets are tight. FLRAA is expensive. It's the largest program in Army history,' Col. Poquette stressed today. 'We can't afford to make a big mistake. &#8230; we can't afford to build the wrong thing. We can't build four or eight prototypes that miss the mark on the thing that's important to the Army.' US Army soldiers 'board' a FLRAA mock-up at Redstone Arsenal in Alabama. US Army Program Executive Office, Aviati As of this year, the estimated total development cost for FLRAA is approximately $652 million, according to the Government Accountability Office. It could ultimately cost the Army around $70 billion to also acquire as many as 2,000 of the tiltrotors and sustain them across decades of expected service life. Tiltotor aircraft development, in general, has historically involved significant risk and FLRAA's ongoing development comes as expected future battlefield realities also continue to evolve. If all goes according to plan now, the Army will have largely finalized all the changes to its future FLRAA tilt-rotors from the V-280 design by the middle of next year, a key step forward toward getting the transformational aircraft into production and operational service.

Leonardo DRS Gives Details On Its Directed-Energy Counter-Drone S...	The War Zone met up with Leonardo DRS’ Ed House and Blue Halo’s Trip Ferguson at the Association of the United States Army’s biggest annual symposium, AUSA ‘24, which is currently underway in Washington, D.C. to get all the details on the new Counter-Uncrewed Aerial Systems Directed Energy (C-UAS DE) Stryker. You can read our initial report on the armored vehicle that is bristling with counter-drone capabilities here, but House and Ferguson put much more color on the canvas for us in terms of exactly what their creation is capable of and where it will sit in a forces’ air defense force structure. Check it out in the video posted at the top of the story. Background: The new C-UAS DE Stryker is armed with a 26-kilowatt version of the LOCUST laser directed energy weapon from BlueHalo, installed on a retractable mount. It’s also equipped with laser-guided 70mm rockets, a 30mm XM914 automatic cannon that fires proximity burst shells, an M240 machine gun, a potent counter-drone electronic warfare suite, radars, electronic surveillance measures, and other sensors and communications gear. Combined, it’s a feature-packed, multi-layer, counter-drone-optimized, short-range air defense battery that can spot, track, and defeat drones — both kinetically and non-kinetically. All of this is packed into a fast-moving armored vehicle that can easily keep up with the troops it is tasked with protecting. The U.S. Army is looking to significantly grow its short-range air defense capabilities in the coming years, especially to counter the ballooning threat from drones, and the service is specifically interested in directed energy options. Leonardo DRS led a team that developed this unique Stryker variant that included seven other partners – BlueHalo, EOS Defense Systems USA, Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems, Arnold Defense, AMPEX, and Digital Systems Engineering. It took this eclectic consortium just eight months from design, build, and test, to culminate in a live fire exercise at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico that resulted in multiple drones being swatted out of the sky. Now, after unveiling their creation at AUSA ‘24, C-UAS DE Stryker is heading to more trials.	https://www.twz.com/sponsored-content/leonardo-drs-gives-details-on-its-directed-energy-counter-drone-stryker	2024-10-16T12:09:16-07:00	https://www.twz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ldrs-ls-stryker-atemrtc-3034-edited-copy.jpg?quality=85
Aerovironment’s New P550 Flies Five Hours On A Charge, Drops Two-...	AeroVironment on Monday unveiled its new drone that can tote weapons and conduct surveillance for up to five hours on a single charge as the company vies for a spot in the Army’s Long-Range Reconnaissance program. The P550, a highly modular battery-powered unmanned aerial system that can take off and land vertically and is able to carry up to 15 pounds of munitions and sensors, made its debut at the Association of the U.S. Army’s annual meeting in Washington. It’s a fresh entrant in a fast-paced competition that looks to improve soldiers’ real-time battlefield awareness at relatively low cost. 'There are things that fly as long, there are things that carry as much, but there's nothing that does both of that … without being fueled in some manner,' Product Line Manager Cris Cornell said Monday. 'There's nothing on the market performing like that in this space.' Soldiers already use small drones like AeroVironment’s hand-launched RQ-11 Raven for battlefield recon. But the LRR program — part of a broader effort to expand the Army’s arsenal of small drones capable of operating at various altitudes and ranges — promises to bring on a new generation of easily transportable drones that can strike targets while relaying combat data back to troops. The reusable P550 builds on the company’s Raven and Puma drones but adds VTOL capability and room for heavier payloads. Measuring about 17 feet wide, 9 feet long and weighing up to 55 pounds, the Group 2 UAS is designed to be a light lift on the battlefield, easy to assemble and simple to operate and upgrade. That wingspan allows the P550 to ferry multiple weapons and sensors at once, in an expansion of capability over AeroVironment’s existing designs. Rachel Cohen/TWZ The war in Ukraine has proven that the U.S. must adopt a strike role for its growing arsenal of small drones to remain lethal and relevant, Cornell said. 'You’ve got to be able to carry stuff — and not just stuff, you’ve got to be able to carry munitions,' Cornell said. The P550 can fly with the GPS-guided Shryke, a munition weighing less than 2.5 pounds developed by L3Harris and Corvid Technologies; Cornell said the company is exploring other options as well. The display at AUSA showed the drone’s fuselage outfitted with a surveillance payload, a signals-intelligence payload and a communications payload to demonstrate its ability to handle multiple missions compared to its predecessors. Rachel Cohen/TWZ Each aircraft can automatically recognize and catagorize targets, freeing up soldiers who would otherwise sift through imagery and other data for hours each day, and transmit that information via data link. It can also save its findings for later in case enemy jamming prevents it from sending the data in real time or for when emissions control is critical to survival. As the data link market has expanded, it’s become more feasible to design a drone that can connect anywhere — unlike the P550’s predecessors and older legacy systems, said Trace Stevenson, AeroVironment’s senior vice president of uncrewed systems. That relies on a modular open systems approach that aims to keep today’s UAS flexible in combat and could stop it from becoming obsolete in a matter of months or a handful of years. AeroVironment in April announced it had partnered with Parry Labs to design the P550’s software and plug-and-play mission systems. 'It's radio-agnostic, payload-agnostic and [ground control station]-agnostic,' Stevenson said. 'We have the common standards that allow the customer to determine what they want to put on the platform. As technology evolves, it'll be able to incorporate any of those … battery packs, payloads, ground control stations going forward.' That’s another lesson learned from Ukraine, Cornell said: '[The battlefield] changes so fast, and you have to have your system set up to be able to adapt to it.' Aerovironment Soldiers don’t need tools to assemble or disassemble the P550; the drone breaks down into three cases that can be tossed on the back of a Joint Light Tactical Vehicle or packed up as part of a larger pallet of equipment. Battalions can be 'up and flying in under 10 minutes and have eyes on top of them out to 40 km-plus range' to scout out a route ahead, watch enemy movement and more, Cornell said. 'We can do searches, map an area, find out where all the targets are, pass those targets to different elements,' he said. Rachel Cohen/TWZ The P550 has already begun flight testing and demonstrations for potential customers. In January 2023, the Army called on industry to offer options for a drone that could vertically take off and land and collect intelligence over nearly 19 miles and at least five hours in flight. The service plans to tap two vendors to mature their designs within the next few months before picking a winner, Stevenson said. Budget documents project it will begin buying the aircraft in fiscal 2027. The Army looks to buy upward of 600 drones for LRR, Cornell said. Soldiers could use a few in tandem to monitor a larger area, but aren’t likely to deploy them in groups of dozens at a time, he added. Officials across the military want to buy legions of drones, large and small, to grow the number of eyes in the sky and multiply their strike capability while sparing fewer dollars to replace a more advanced aircraft if it goes down. Stevenson said the company is preparing to build thousands of P550s each year. The AeroVironment reps declined to answer how much the UAS costs per unit.

Shield AI Looks To Unleash Its Hivemind Autonomy Software On Mult...	Artificial Intelligence (AI) is touching our lives in varying forms every day and that is only set to accelerate. It is also becoming a massive growth sector in the defense industry. It is posited by friends and adversaries alike that whoever can possess AI supremacy will have a huge advantage on tomorrow’s battlefield. Defense contractor Shield AI has established a firm footing at the bleeding edge, using AI-infused cognitive autonomy to enhance military capability. The company has developed its own family of small quadcopters that use its AI algorithms to efficiently sweep buildings for threats, and its larger drone known as V-BAT that can launch vertically, transition to forward flight, and operate as part of an automated swarming team. Shield AI says its autonomy is designed to be sufficiently versatile to be platform agnostic, meaning that it can be scaled and implemented across an infinite number of different platforms, and not just those in its own stable. NATO defines autonomy as a system's ability to function without outside intervention based on acquired knowledge and situational awareness. Within this, there are two main types when it comes to applying AI to military weapon systems: platform and mission autonomy. Platform autonomy focuses on self-management tasks like flight, navigation, and communication, as well as handling functions such as takeoff, landing, and fault detection. Mission autonomy, however, is more advanced, enabling systems to execute complex tasks, make tactical decisions, and seamlessly coordinate with other systems in dynamic environments. Shield AI's V-BAT drone employs Hivemind autonomy. Shield AI The War Zone sat down with Shield AI’s vice president of engineering for Hivemind, Christian Gutierrez, who is in charge of autonomy engineering and Shield AI’s vision of steadily expanding through integration on an increasing variety of military platforms. TWZ: Before we dive into Shield AI’s autonomy, and specifically your Hivemind product, can you outline your background and technical specializations that you bring to Shield AI? Gutierrez: Well, I started my career as an avionics technician in the U.S. Air Force, working on F-117 Nighthawks and then F-16 Vipers that I deployed with to Iraq back in 2005. I also worked command and control, and battle management for NORAD [North American Aerospace Defense Command] in the Homeland defense alert mission. I then joined Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works as an embedded software engineer working on a critical development program for future-generation aircraft and ground systems. That work included a lot of development testing in that realm before I transitioned to human space flight and deep space missions with my work being focused on software and navigation, learning about the hostility of deep space. Then I became the chief of systems engineering for a family of hypersonic missiles. In that role, I led electrical mechanical ordnance propulsion and the whole lifecycle of the systems. That program ran from inception, through capture, design development, and multiple flight tests for many customers including the U.S. Army and the Navy. All of that experience led me to my current role with Shield AI and our vision of deploying our AI [artificial intelligence] solution across a host of platforms and domains. Right now we’re focused on the air segment, but we're already growing and scaling to expand into different domains such as maritime. We see our success in this industry surrounding our ability to develop the capability to suit the varying needs of different warfighters. TWZ: Can you give us your take on the expansion of autonomy in the military space and explain Shield AI’s approach to mission autonomy, and the opportunities this creates. Gutierrez: When I was at Lockheed Martin – as a platform provider – we started touching on the early phases of what we call platform autonomy, so for example, an autopilot with enhanced features. Since that time a clear bifurcation between platform autonomy and mission autonomy has developed. Think of the latter as a valuable blend of a mission planner and a pilot. Shield AI’s Hivemind autonomy can help companies that excel in developing and building platforms to push the envelope through the employment of mission autonomy. There has to be maturity in both the platform and the autonomy so that we can collectively execute this successfully. In terms of challenges, we need alignment and standards to be fully established around autonomy, much like the automotive industry has done. That will allow us to make aligned progress ahead of our adversaries. At a high level, we think there is industry consensus on the split between mission and platform autonomy. We are working with industry partners to promote understanding of where this lies in terms of defining those levels of autonomy. At Shield AI we are sending a strong message around establishing and maintaining stringent industry standards. We know what they are for automotive, and leaders of AI and autonomy, and the world's leading defense contractors, are now working together to define the standards for our industry. Shield AI is focused on building trust with our customers and developing relationships. That is formed around clearly understanding concepts of operations, understanding the operational needs of different theaters, and understanding the limitations of technology that currently exists. Then we can start to help advance those technologies with our technology. Success in the defense industry is relatively straightforward – it’s the ability to develop and deliver for the warfighter. So first you have to understand what it is the warfighter needs. For that, Shield AI has recruited industry experts to help us shape our operational analysis and our understanding of exactly what is needed. It’s then about having the required expertise to take it through development, integration, and testing. We also need to be very direct with how we regulate all of this and ensure we have the right certification and standards in place. TWZ: Could you share examples of mission autonomy in action? Any real-world wins that demonstrate the effectiveness of your autonomy software and how these successes have shaped your strategy? Gutierrez: Mission autonomy is real – this isn’t theory or PowerPoint. Our technical approach is informed by our experiences with Hivemind, which started out in our small Nova quadcopter drones from 2018. This was years before most people had even heard of mission autonomy. Since then we've been scaling up to Group 3 unmanned air vehicles such as V-BAT and we're doing it seamlessly thanks to how we have developed our Hivemind software stack, which was developed from the outset to be extensible and modular. Our software stack is about perception, cognition, and action. We perceive something, we identify it, then we take action. Hivemind runs through our V-BAT unmanned system, and it has been proven in projects such as the X-62A VISTA [Variable-stability In-flight Simulator Test Aircraft] where we were in complete control of maneuvering an F-16 fighter and showcasing that we could go head-to-head with crewed fighters in dogfights. The X-62A VISTA used Hivemind autonomy to fly the aircraft – a modified F-16. Shield AI We've got several flight tests that we are currently running, including showcasing operations in denied environments. That’s exercising our state estimation algorithms – which is about aggregating data from various sensors to establish where the platform is at in terms of state, so the platform can continue its mission. We also recently completed live fly testing with two Kratos MQM-178 Firejets and two crewed chase aircraft. That testing was about proving the ability to operate what we call intelligent mass, that means crewed and uncrewed platforms coming together and breaking apart at will. That was a huge accomplishment in a first-of-its-kind test. The team is extraordinarily excited about that because we are developing and maturing our technology and it's a huge win at the Group 5 unmanned level. You can read more about this here. TWZ: Can you explain how Hivemind can support enhancements in different platforms? Gutierrez: It goes back to that bifurcation of platform autonomy and mission autonomy. In the military aviation world, the platforms have to fly. But they also have to accomplish a mission, and that's where we come in – where our Hivemind autonomy stack can accomplish a mission. For example, military combat platforms typically have a set of sensors and a feed from those sensors. So, they might need to locate a target. We take those inputs and use AI to make decisions. The decisions being made can be as complex as working out a location or finding an object or target. When we talk about our AI in air platforms, the natural immediate thought is that it's a pilot. That’s right in part, because yes, the AI is flying the aircraft, but that is only a very small part of what you're doing. It's actually the mission side of it that's more of a critical area. You're relying on the platform autonomy to fly the aircraft, and the mission autonomy is telling it to bank and maneuver and climb, etc, to achieve the mission objectives. On the VISTA program we were closer to the control part, the stick controls and things like that to actually fly the actual airplane. But that’s not really the environment we are focused on, it’s much more about the mission autonomy. We aren’t building a bespoke solution that only meets the needs of one platform, and we definitely don’t want it to be locked down in that way. We need to offer modularity, the ability to scale across different platforms in any class or group, adaptability, and interoperability. We need to be able to scale across maritime, space, missile defense, you name it, applying government standards of open architecture so we can operate within anybody's environment via a set of tooling. That means you can generate an AI pilot for example, and we can license that tool suite so a customer can either maintain what we generated for them or develop their own AI for whatever segment or platform they have in mind. A platform manufacturer can come to us as world renowned experts in AI and software development and we can work with them to help develop their own solution for their fleet of aircraft. So, we get away from that vendor lock situation by being open and able to integrate on any system or within any business model. We essentially license our software to them and then work as a partner. This way they get full access to the system, and they are able to do some development themselves. The U.S. government really wants to show that suppliers are integrating with a host of industry partners and that you can deliver a product that’s not solely controlled and owned by the prime contractor. A way of doing that is to expose the interfaces to ensure that everyone has access. That's exactly what we do with our solution. Our bread and butter is the underlying algorithms that generate that AI effect, and it can then be customized as required to meet needs and missions. Shield AI recently completed highly-successful tests with its AI embedded in Kratos Firejets. Shield AI TWZ: What are the key factors that differentiate Shield AI from competitors, especially in terms of your technology? Gutierrez: You have reference architecture, which is the pilot. The core reference implementation is the Intellectual Property [IP], which is all the underlying algorithms, then you have the enterprise, that’s the tooling. Our middleware strategy with industry compliance and modular design enables rapid customization. Having middleware allows you to integrate in a host of hardware environments. It doesn't mean you account for all of them, and that’s why we're also investing in our own computer hardware so that we can offer to work in their hardware environment, or we can bring our own computer box. That middleware is critical, and we've invested in it over the years. We can adapt to any platform with any sensor and with any mission with ease, and we can do it ourselves, or we can enable that provider to do it themselves. That's a huge differentiator. We can show a customer how to do one example and then they can take over and continue to execute while we provide support. That approach seems to really resonate with the customer. The goal is to be able to integrate Hivemind into any hardware environment that a platform provider has. If the environment isn't suitable, for example it doesn't have enough compute, or it doesn't have the power, then we can provide our own ‘compute box.’ We can speak whatever protocol the platform might have, be it MIL-STD-1553 or whatever, there's all kinds of protocols on board these platforms. So having a compute box that can speak to many interfaces is hugely important and just the kind of detail that we think through to ensure that it is a low bar to entry with platform providers. We talk a lot about reinforcement learning and the AI technologies and techniques that we use to conduct a mission. How we learn from the mission, adapt it and then redeploy it onto a platform within hours. Then there's the stack of the cognition, perception, and action, which is tied to our task and behavior model which mimics human behavior. With the VISTA tests, and what we have just seen with Firejet, we are leaps ahead of everyone else. With Firejet, the customer said that was the best flight performance they’d seen. The maneuverability, everything, just went phenomenally well. We know that it is the best, but we also know the hard work that went into it and our competitors have a lot to do to keep up with us, but competition keeps us on the edge of our seats. TWZ: Modern flight tests are very rigorous. Do you see autonomy working in the same boundaries or do you foresee a need to rewrite the rulebook to be more agile? Gutierrez: I think the rulebook is being rewritten as we speak. We are at the bleeding edge and forcing regulators to catch up. Shield AI holds unique expertise in this industry, and our experts are able to explain the intent and then work with customers to shape test plans and meet criteria. We are hiring industry experts especially in mission planning airworthiness certification, which is a huge piece for us – managing FAA regulations, safety boards, and those kinds of areas. Also, professionals with a test and integration background, plus experts in modeling and simulation as well as operational analysis. Shield AI experts are working closely with the military and other industry partners. Shield AI The operational analysis, integration, and test modeling and simulation create that trifecta needed to successfully navigate operational test and evaluation and to build trust with your customer. You must have that pedigree of testing, especially for that kind of automated testing. It’s imperative that we show our customers that we understand how to develop and integrate with complex weapons systems. We are also talking about the definitions of the levels of autonomy, which hasn't been formally written down, so it’s difficult for certification boards to say whether you meet the intent and criteria. We are defining this and applying the tried and trusted methods that we're adopting. I mean, we don’t see a need to reinvent the wheel, just automate it. Adapting to what we see in the field is critical, making fixes, then getting it through testing fast. We must shorten that timeline. Historically, it’s taken months before a patch is deployed, and we want to get these upgrades out into the field within hours. We need to be audacious. TWZ: How do you envision Shield AI’s technologies and products complementing those of prime contractors or aircraft builders? Gutierrez: Traditionally, having a gap in capability leads to investing a ton of money to develop a very exquisite system. Once that system is finally operational, it may no longer be relevant. We've wrapped up the war in the Middle East and now we have a problem in the South China Sea, so a platform designed for one may no longer be effective for the other. That’s where Shield AI comes in and makes a weapon system more effective. For example, we can increase range. That’s not fuel range, but operating range, mission effectiveness range, advancing capabilities and technologies. We are not pitching our capabilities as a threat to industry, but as a vital partner to success. The bigger the partner and platform portfolio, the more powerful Shield AI’s value proposition becomes through the embedding of our Hivemind software. For example, the need to address stand-off in the South China Sea when a platform cannot penetrate. We can look at the set of problems around that penetration and develop a set of technologies to help overcome deficiencies in maybe something that has changed since the original requirements were set. Traditionally, this might necessitate a new aircraft or a different block upgrade, which equates to billions of dollars of investment. Shield AI can assess the issue and potentially help with a solution. It’s not easy to just drop in new hardware, but our compute hardware is super lightweight and small and it is absolutely able to make these more intelligent systems. TWZ: Can you explain how Shield AI autonomy can enhance platforms right now. Gutierrez: We talk about coming in as a software upgrade not hardware. They are currently limited to platform autonomy because they don’t have the technology to do the mission autonomy. Particularly with regard to unmanned systems, it's critically important to be able to push the envelope there. If you think of crewed aircraft such as the F-35, for example, a Shield AI solution could be configurable as a co-pilot. There’s a lot of things we can do to help protect the asset. You could enable cognitive behavior within your electronic warfare sensor suite. There might be signals that are not recognized, that haven't been registered before and you need to come back and send the signal out to somebody to process and then have a new jamming effect drawn up and then implemented. We could automatically update the mission data in flight, there and then, and the system would learn from it. That could continue exponentially. Shield AI says that it's autonomy could be used in the F-35, for example. Jamie Hunter TWZ: Looking forward, how do you see Shield AI’s approach to mission autonomy evolving? Gutierrez: We're trailblazing here and frankly ahead of what people can wrap their head around. We have to demonstrate our credentials, and we have to do all this ethically and partner with the right agencies. When we talk about working at the edge, we are talking about no communications – it’s the platform and its mission autonomy. So, how do you ensure it’s still doing the right things that you wanted it to do? We're currently working through that with a really slick solution that ensures there's essentially a third voter. Sort of like an arbitrator. It’s something that we're actively working on right now. It’s going to build great trust with our customers. It's not even the way it will monitor and ensure the location we want our platform to be at, it’s about keeping what we're doing safe and it's within the boundaries of the mission profile. TWZ: In terms of mission technology that’s developing fast, I’d assume Ukraine is a big focus right now? Gutierrez: We're keeping a close eye on what's going on there. We're seeing firsthand some of the technologies that are being employed by the Russians. The agility and speed to adapt and iterate has been shown to be critical, particularly in denied environments. It’s easy to see how you might initially enter an environment like that and operate effectively. But maybe just a few days later the adversary has adapted to throw your sensors off. You need to adapt, evolve, and that’s where we can help. But you can’t teach a system that’s not there. If you don’t have the hardware in the first place you cannot have an effect. That’s why we are not a threat to the platform, we're a partner capability enhancer. TWZ: In the next five years, what do you think will surprise people about developments in autonomy for aircraft, and perhaps other types of platforms. Gutierrez: We are assimilating a body of industry experts, and we've got fantastic leads and opportunities that will help us to address gaps in maritime operations, for example, be that surface or subsurface or within the space domain, within missile defense. There are legacy systems out there that need life extension, that next-generation capability and we are actively expanding into those market spaces. The definition of what cognitive autonomy is will be fully defined, and we will be at the bleeding edge of it. We have also been very thoughtful about awarding certification and about safety. We've also been very thoughtful about how we integrate into existing or developing platforms with our own compute hardware or our middleware. So, you're going to see Shield AI proliferate across many domains. Cognitive autonomy will become more understood and widely embraced, so in five years if we’re only talking about aircraft flying with our autonomy I would be surprised!

Australia To Send M1 Abrams Tanks To Ukraine	Australia will provide Ukraine with 49 M1A1 Abrams main battle tanks, a significant boost for Kyiv’s armored units, as they continue to face down Russia’s full-scale invasion. The announcement comes amid lingering questions about the effectiveness of the Abrams tanks that have already been supplied to Ukraine, including reports from this summer suggesting they had been briefly withdrawn from combat operations. We can’t confirm they actually were withdrawn, and surviving examples have meanwhile been upgraded, reflecting their continued relevance. Pat Conroy, Australia’s Minister for Defense Industry and Capability Delivery, told the press today that the surplus M1A1s would be transferred to Ukraine, ending a long period of speculation about their fate. The tanks have an estimated value of $164 million and bring total Australian military assistance to Ukraine to more than $1.3 billion. A formal announcement about the transfer will be made tomorrow, at the meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels. An Australian Army M1A1 Abrams tank from the 2nd Cavalry Regiment and an Australian Army soldier from the 3rd Battalion, The Royal Australian Regiment during Exercise Brolga Sprint 24 at Townsville Field Training Area, Queensland, in June 2024. Australian Department of Defense TPR Dana Millington 'These tanks will deliver more firepower and mobility to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, and complement the support provided by our partners for Ukraine for Ukraine’s armored brigades,' Conroy said in a statement. 'We stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine in their fight against Russia’s illegal invasion,' Conroy added. Since the tanks were originally sold to Australia by the United States, Washington had to approve the transfer to Ukraine. In an interview with ABC, Ukraine’s ambassador to Australia Vasyl Myroshnychenko described the tank transfer as a 'significant contribution' to Ukraine’s war effort. The development also marks a U-turn by the Australian government. Earlier this year, Australian Minister for Defense Richard Marles said that providing the tanks to Ukraine was 'not on the agenda.' Kyiv had previously requested that Australia consider providing it with Abrams tanks, as well as other heavy weapons. In the past, we pointed out how the upgraded former Australian F/A-18A/B Hornet fleet could be very useful for Ukraine, after which Ambassador Myroshnychenko confirmed to TWZ that Ukraine was indeed exploring if the fighters could be suitable for its very pressing needs. Since then, there have not been any further developments in this area, as far as we know. Also on Kyiv’s list was Australia’s fleet of 45 MRH90 Taipan helicopters, withdrawn last year after repeated cost increases, fleet groundings, and two major crashes. You can read more about that here. An Australian Army MRH90 Taipan at Townsville Field Training Area, Townsville, Queensland. Australian Department of Defense An Australian Army MRH90 Taipan from the 5th Aviation Regiment lands as part of air mobility operations with the 3rd Battalion, The Royal Australian Regiment on Exercise Brolga Run 23 at Townsville Field Training Area, Townsville, Queensland. COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE In the event, rather than donate the helicopters, Australia decided to strip them of valuable parts and bury them. Canberra’s decision to now provide the Abrams tanks should at least help assuage Ukraine’s disappointment in not securing the Taipans. On the other hand, it should also be noted that the age of the surplus M1A1s means that it might not be possible to put them all into service. Some may well also have to be reduced to spare parts if they are otherwise deemed too worn-out for frontline use. The Australian Army is able to give up its M1A1 fleet as it’s now receiving 75 new M1A2 Abrams, in the highly capable SEPv3 variant. You can read more about Australia’s $2.5-billion M1A2 acquisition here. One of the first M1A2 Abrams tanks for the Australian Army on display at the Land Forces Melbourne 2024 exhibition earlier this year. Australian Department of Defense Cpl Michael Currie Australia also confirmed that a small number of its 59 old tanks — 10 in total — will be retained to assist in the transition to the new tanks. It’s unclear if these will be used permanently for training or testing purposes or if they will also head to Ukraine later. Ukraine previously received 31 M1A1 tanks from the United States. The first of these had arrived in the country at least by September of last year, although the first video showing one of the tanks in action on the front lines didn’t emerge until February of this year. While the arrival of the U.S.-supplied Abrams in Ukraine came amid much fanfare, an apparent first loss of an M1A1, also in February, led to questions being raised about just how survivable these tanks are on the country’s highly contested battlefields. Imagery captured from a drone that looks to show one of Ukraine’s prized U.S.-supplied M1A1 Abrams tanks having suffered significant damage. via X Initially, it seems that the M1A1s were deployed mainly around Avdiivka, the key city in the eastern Donbas region, which was captured by Russian forces in mid-February. By May of this year, Ukrainian M1A1 were starting to get production-standard anti-drone armor screens, also commonly known as 'cope cages,' on their turrets. The modified Abrams also started receiving additional explosive reactive armor (ERA). A Ukrainian M1A1 Abrams with anti-drone armor screens on its turret. Metinvest Since then even more extreme modifications have surfaced, with one configuration including new plate armor and other additions. Via X Nevertheless, as losses continued to mount, unconfirmed reports emerged in the spring suggesting that Ukraine had withdrawn its M1A1s from frontline operations. By that time, five of the 31 tanks were confirmed as having been lost to Russian attacks. It was said that the reason for the withdrawal was the tank’s vulnerability to drone attacks, although the reasoning was somewhat hazy. As TWZ speculated at the time, it seems more likely that if the tanks were pulled it was because they are considered especially valuable assets, and having more examples knocked out — or, worse still, captured — by Russia would be an unpleasant propaganda and materiel loss for Kyiv. Preserving the dwindling force for when it was needed most and quickly upgrading them with additional protection could have also been a real factor.

Photo by Vlad Karkov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images SOPA Images Whatever the reasoning, and the reality of the supposed ‘combat pause,’ the U.S.-supplied M1A1s have recently been in the thick of the action, including contributing to the Ukrainian incursion into Russia’s Kursk region, which began in early August. Also involved have been examples of Ukraine’s other higher-end tank types, including the Challenger 2, Leopard 2, and T-80. A video from the fighting in Kursk from August showed the destruction of another M1A1, which brought the total losses to 16, according to the Oryx open-source tracking group — over half the force. While tank losses are always to be expected, especially during breakthrough operations and when faced with a proliferation of attack drones as well as relentless Russian artillery, questions about the Ukrainian Abrams have refused to go away. Ukrainian personnel interviewed by Western media outlets have raised concerns about the U.S.-made tank’s reliability and its vulnerability to Russian attacks. Explosive reactive tiles attached to a Ukrainian M1A1 Abrams. Unknown author/Twitter/X screencap Nevertheless, there’s no doubt that the M1A1 remains a very useful weapon and one that Ukraine only wants more of. This is especially the case now, as it begins to lose some ground to the larger Russian force. Kyiv is also still feeling the effects of the months-long pause on deliveries of military hardware from the United States after the funding available for security assistance to Ukraine ran out. The United States has so far not signaled that it’s willing to send more Abrams tanks to Ukraine even as they continue to commit to fielding more Bradley Fighting Vehicles. This makes today’s announcement from Australia all the more welcome for Ukraine. While we don’t yet know when the Australian-provided Abrams tanks will start to arrive in Ukraine, they will, at the very least, bolster what was always a fairly tokenistic force, in terms of numbers of vehicles. At the same time, increasing M1A1 numbers and growing experience with these tanks may yet see them finally overturn persisting doubts around their usefulness.

Army Looking To Shrink Typhon Missile System After Lessons Learne...	The U.S. Army is already interested in scaling down its new Typhon ground-based missile system, if possible, to help make it easier to deploy and operate. The service only sent Typhon, which currently uses large tractor-trailer launchers to fire Tomahawk cruise missiles and SM-6 multi-purpose missiles, overseas for the first time to the Philippines earlier this year. Typhon, also known as the Mid-Range Capability (MRC), was among the topics of discussion at a panel talk centered on the Army's new Multi-Domain Task Forces (MTDF) at the Association of the U.S. Army's (AUSA) main annual conference earlier today. Typhon is a key component of the current approved force structure for the service's three MDTFs. In addition to Typhon, each of the task forces is set to eventually incorporate units armed with the Dark Eagle hypersonic missiles and the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) short-range ballistic missiles, as well as a variety of air and missile defense, counter-drone, electronic warfare, and other advanced capabilities. A Typhon launcher in the Philippines. US Army 'So, the Mid-Range Capability, we fielded it, we have put it into the theater, but we're learning lessons on how we can improve the next evolutions of that,' Army Col. Michael Rose, commander of the 3rd MDTF headquartered at Fort Shafter in Hawaii, said today at AUSA. 'How do we make it more mobile? How do we make it smaller? How do we make it more agile? How do we employ it most effectively and how do we sustain it? A lot of those lessons are feeding back into our RDT&E [research, development, test, and evaluations] and acquisitions professionals to improve and enhance that new operational capability.' Rose did not elaborate further, but it is not hard to see how Typhon's current configuration, which is technically road-mobile and air-transportable, might present certain operational limitations. At the core of a typical Typhon battery at present are four trailer-based launchers, each towed by an 8&#215;8 tractor from the Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT) family. A fifth trailer, also towed by a HEMTT tractor, provides a mobile battery operations center (BOC). There are other supporting vehicles and equipment in the unit's inventory, as well. A briefing slide laying on the basic components of a typical Typhon battery. US Army It's also worth noting that each Typhon launcher, which is derived from the Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) used on various U.S. and foreign warships, can only hold up to four missiles at a time. As such, the entire battery can fire 16 missiles before needing to reload, which requires additional vehicles and equipment. The system does offer a wide breadth of capabilities given the abilities of the Tomahawk and the SM-6 to strike targets on land and at sea. The Army has also been eying the very versatile SM-6 for potential ground-based use in its surface-to-air mode.

Ryan DeBooy The picture seen below of a Typhon launcher rolling off a U.S. Air Force C-17 during 1st MDTF's first overseas deployment of elements of the system to the Philippines in April underscores the large size of the trailer-based components and their HEMTT prime movers. US Army Air Force cargo aircraft are in high demand even in peacetime and there are concerns already about the capacity of existing fleets to meet operational needs during future conflicts, especially in a potential high-end fight in the Pacific against China. There is a also growing focus within the U.S. military on concepts of operations involving dispersing forces across a wide network of operating locations to reduce their vulnerability, and many of those sites could well be completely inaccessible to larger airlifters like the C-17. There is also the matter of increasingly more capable and longer-range air defense threats. To be fair, it would have been an easy geolocation. There are just a few 1000 m runways for a C-17 in Luzon, and the very first image showed the launcher in front of a wall we've seen before. (The US has exercised here before.)

A couple of observations. pic.twitter.com/FW9B97sAMU&mdash; Dr. Jeffrey Lewis (@ArmsControlWonk) May 26, 2024 Typhon's size and weight could limit the ability to deploy the system by sea, especially in the absence of available established port facilities, or even over land depending on the environment. Insufficiently wide and/or strong bridges are already a well-known impediment to the movement of tanks and other heavy armored vehicles. Deployment limitations, along with other factors, also impact how and where the Typhon can be employed and create potential vulnerabilities. Col. Rose and the others on the MDTF panel at AUSA today did not offer any examples of potential or notional options for how Typhon might be scaled down or otherwise improved upon. The U.S. Marine Corps, which has been completely reorganizing itself to align with new expeditionary and distributed concepts of operations, is in the process of fielding a ground-based Tomahawk cruise missile launcher mounted on an uncrewed derivative of the 4&#215;4 Joint Light Tactical Vehicle. The Marines' Long Range Fires (LRF) launcher is substantially smaller and lighter than the Typhon launcher, but also can only be loaded with a single Tomahawk at a time. A Marine Corps Long Range Fires launcher vehicle. USMC The Army has also been experimenting with an uncrewed derivative of the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) called the Autonomous Multi-domain Launcher (AML) with a particular eye toward future dispersed operations. AML and HIMARS can both fire 227mm guided artillery rockets, as well as Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) and PRSM ballistic missiles, but, at least in their current forms, the launchers are not long enough to accommodate Tomahawk. AML might still be a starting place for a more truncated launcher for use with Typhon. HIMARS itself was originally developed as a way to fit at least some of the capabilities of the M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) into a package that could squeeze inside a C-130 cargo plane. It's also worth noting here that the U.S. Navy has been experimenting with containerized Mk 70 launchers, which are very similar in form and function to the Typhon launchers and are also based on the Mk 41 VLS, in ship and ground-based configurations. However, the ground-based arrangement that has been demonstrated to date is also a relatively large tractor-trailer setup. A Navy trailer-mounted Mk 70 launcher rolls off a US Air Force C-17 during training in Denmark in 2023. US Navy A US Navy trailer-mounted Mk 70 launcher in its deployed position. US Navy New, smaller missiles might be another option for scaling down Typhon. As a tangential example, the new PRSMs are notably smaller than the ATACMSs they are replacing, but offer longer range and other important capability boosts. At the same time, this would be a major shift for Typhon, especially given the investments the Army has made already in Tomahawk and SM-6. Developing something entirely new would be costly, as well. A test launch of a PRSM from a HIMARS launcher. Lockheed Martin In the meantime, Typhon has already made a significant mark in the Pacific region, being lauded by the U.S. military's counterparts in the Philippines and drawing the ire of China. The Philippine armed forces have even expressed an interest in acquiring their own Typhons. This has certainly presented a counter-example to questions raised in the past about where Typhon systems, as well as Dark Eagle hypersonic missiles, might be deployed, especially in the Pacific, at all due in part to potential resistance from allies and partners to host them. From where elements of the system are currently deployed in Northern Luzon, Typhon holds targets at risk in the southeastern end of mainland China, as well as on Hanan Island in the northern end of the South China Sea. Several Chinese man-made outposts elsewhere in the South China Sea, as well as targets at sea in the surrounding areas, would also be in range. Hainan, in particular, is home to several highly strategic naval and other bases. In September, the People's Liberation Army also conducted an extremely rare intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launch out over the Pacific from the island. All of this is a reminder of the importance of Typhon, and being able to deploy and employ it effectively, as well as the possible vulnerabilities that might come along with the system in its current form. Typhon, as well as Dark Eagle, which could face many of the same deployability issues with its trailer-based launchers, are presently set to be low-density, high-value assets that would be prime targets for an opponent, especially in a large-scale conflict. With all this in mind, it will be interesting to see how Typhon does or doesn't evolve, size-wise in or in any other regard, based on what the Army is still learning from its early fielding of the system.

Army Already Preparing For V-280 Valor To Dramatically Transform ...	The U.S. Army doesn’t expect to get its hands on the new V-280 Valor Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft, or FLRAA, until 2030 at the earliest, but it’s already developing tactics for when the advanced tiltrotor arrives. This fact illustrates just how much of a revolution FLRAA is anticipated to bring, including entirely overhauling the speed, range, and survivability of air assault operations. Speaking earlier today at the Association of the U.S. Army’s annual symposium, Maj. Gen. Brett Sylvia, commanding general of the 101st Airborne Division, explained the degree to which FLRAA will change the way that historic division, and other Army units, will go to war. U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Brett Sylvia, at that time 1st Cavalry Division Forward commander, now the commanding general of the 101st Airborne Division, at a combined arms rehearsal in Poland, June 6, 2020. U.S. Army photo by Spc. Javan Johnson Spc. Javan Johnson The forthcoming arrival of FLRAA has led to a new concept of operations for the Army, which is now taking shape. This is Large-Scale, Long-Range Air Assault, or L2A2, and, simply put, it relies upon the new tiltrotor to be realized. As TWZ has explored in the past, the specific range and speed advantage of the V-280 Valor was very likely a significant reason why it was chosen for FLRAA ahead of Boeing’s rival SB>1 Defiant. While the engineering and manufacturing development phase for FLRAA continues, the Army is practicing the L2A2 concept using the aircraft it has on hand. According to Sylvia, L2A2 is defined by the ability to 'deliver one Brigade Combat Team in one period of darkness, over 500 miles, arriving behind enemy lines, and be able to conduct sustained combat operations.' 'We can’t do that right now is because the platforms that we have organic to the 101st are not enough in order for us to be able to do that in one period of darkness,' Sylvia added.

Jacob Derry Staff Sgt. Jacob Derry Instead, over the last 12 months, the 'The Screaming Eagles' have undertaken four exercises to explore what it takes to move a Brigade Combat Team over that distance, all the while moving exclusively at night. In the latest of these training events, the division’s 2nd Brigade Combat Team was moved to the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) at Fort Johnson, Louisiana. The 101st is home-based at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, 575 miles distant, from where the simulated air assault was launched. While moving from one location to the other was achieved, it required the division to set up two mission support sites and six Forward Arming and Refueling Points (FARPs) en route to ensure the movement of the helicopter assault force. More significantly, it also required three nights in order to be able to move that entire Brigade Combat Team under the cover of darkness. Meanwhile, staffing all of the mission support sites and FARPs, as well as related security and sustainment forces, required almost a thousand soldiers.

Wes Wright The next part of the training was done as a simulation, this time involving the future Air Assault CAB, a formation created to ensure the Army can conduct L2A2. As Sylvia explained, the Air Assault CAB is going to have four times the number of heavy-lift aircraft than what he has available today, and all of the unit’s UH-60 Black Hawks will be replaced by FLRAA.

U.S. Army 'When we ran that in simulation, we were able to execute that one Brigade Combat Team move in one period of darkness, so we made our timeline,' Sylvia said. 'But the second thing, and probably more critical than that, was that we cut in half that sustainment and security that we needed. We went down to one mission support site and only three Forward Arming and Refueling Points in order to be able to execute that. I don’t think I need to tell you what that does in terms of our survivability, because of our speed and our lower signature when we can execute that.' Over the course of the next few years, the Army will continue to build its Air Assault Combat Aviation Brigade, to meet L2A2 aspirations. In the meantime, as Sylvia said, 'We are doing the things in order to be able to build the foundation so that all we have to do is just receive the aircraft and we’ll be ready to execute.' 'What we can do, is we can build the tactics, techniques, and procedures, build the doctrine, build the structures, understand the sustainment in order to be able to do that.'

(Bell) Sylvia also addressed how the Army was working to adapt how its future mission support sites and FARPs would look like so that they can survive and be effective during large-scale conflicts with peer or near-peer adversaries, including over significant distances, as will be found in the Indo-Pacific theater. Sylvia said the 101st Airborne Division’s current training is exploring changes to support sites and FARPs so they can 'operate in a semi-permissive or in a non-permissive environment.' In the future, the Army’s FARPs will have to be 'dispersed, distributed, and much smaller,' Sylvia noted. Sylvia recalled one of the exercises that explored new ways of distributing FARPs. 'We didn’t land like we traditionally do, where you go, you take over an airfield, and you park all your aircraft out there in the field. So now we are taking our aircraft, we are parking them in a very distributed manner, not on airfields. We’re camouflaging the aircraft, camouflaging the FARPs out there.'

U.S. Air Force photo by Capt. Jessica Tait Capt. Jessica Tait A resurgence in interest in camouflaging such assets to deceive opponents and otherwise help to conceal the movements and activities of friendly forces is something that we have examined in the past and is especially relevant for any future high-end fight involving the United States, such as one against China in the Pacific. Initial findings have been highly encouraging, Sylvia noted. 'During one of our exercises, when we got done afterward, and we were talking with the opposing force commander, he said, ‘Hey, I had great success in finding and targeting your FARPs.’ And I said, ‘Yeah, how many did you get?’ And he said, ‘I got two.’ I said, ‘Did you know I had nine out there?’ And he said, ‘Obviously I wasn’t as good as I thought I was.’ And so that’s the point. We do have to think about how we do these things differently. New capabilities certainly are great, but I think our tactics and techniques are the things that are going to be most effective in the near term.' A first FLRAA for the Army is expected to take to the air in 2026, with low-rate initial production slated to begin in 2028, leading to initial fielding in 2030. While the Army may be pinning its hopes of achieving Large-Scale, Long-Range Air Assault firmly on FLRAA, that doesn’t mean the UH-60 will be disappearing any time soon. A prototype V-280 Valor.

Clair Gill, Commanding General at the U.S. Army Aviation Center of Excellence and Fort Novosel, said that the future force mix will come down to the specific situation and operational demands at the time — as well as budgetary constraints. 'Would I love to put a FLRAA everywhere that there's a Black Hawk? Sure. Do I think it’s affordable? Probably not,' Gill told reporters. 'The Black Hawk is coming up on 40 years old, I believe, and my sense is the Black Hawk is going to compete with the B-52 and C-130 for going the distance. We’re going to have Black Hawks in our formation as long as any of us are reading the news.' 'I think FLRAA is going to come on.' Gill continued. 'We’re going to learn a lot about it. We’re going to scale it. We’re going to see where we are in the 2030s, once we go to full-rate production and we get that first limited test unit out, learn a lot about it, we got to figure out how we train it. We start proliferating it. And if it, if it is that game-changing technology and everybody says that we’ve got to double down, then maybe we buy more. But I think initially it’s going to be some sort of a mix, and I don’t see the Black Hawk going away.'

Thousands Of North Korean Troops To Help Russia Fight Ukraine: Re...	Thousands of North Korean troops are being trained to provide combat power in Ukraine to help Russia make up for mounting losses, according to reports. The move is part of a growing alliance between Moscow and Pyongyang that benefits both parties in several ways. 'The North Koreans will form part of the ‘Special Buryat Battalion,’ organized within the 11th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade of the Russian Armed Forces,' the Ukrainian Liga media outlet reported on Tuesday. 'The battalion is expected to include up to 3,000 North Korean troops and is currently being supplied with small arms and ammunition.' First notable glimpse at DPRK troop contribution to Russia. A 'Buryat battalion' consisting of DPRK personnel were stood up in the 11th Guards Air Assault Brigade. It’s made up of around 3,000 personnel for Ukraine’s Kursk salient. 18 members deserted. Dillon Payton (@dillonrpayton) October 15, 2024 Liga suggested that the battalion could be deployed near the Ukrainian-occupied town of Sudzha in Russia’s Kursk region, but the exact location or arrival time remains unknown. The Ukrainian Suspline news outlet suggested that there are already a number of North Korean troops there. Meanwhile, North Koreans could also find themselves fighting on Ukrainian soil, Andriy Kovalenko, head of Ukraine’s Center for Countering Disinformation, said on Telegram. Thousands of North Korean infantry soldiers are undergoing training in Russia and could be deployed to the front line in Ukraine by the end of this year, The Washington Post wrote last week, citing a Ukrainian military intelligence official. 'The official said North Korean officers are already on the ground in Russia-occupied Ukraine to observe Russian forces and study the battlefield, but Kyiv hasn’t seen any North Korean units fighting yet,' the Post reported. As we previously noted, dozens of North Koreans are behind Russian lines in Ukraine. They are operating 'in teams that support launcher systems for KN-23 [short-range ballistic] missiles,' a source in Ukraine told The Guardian last week. North Korea began supplying Russia with those missiles, also known as Hwasong-11s, but about half were defective, according to an analysis from Ukrainian state prosecutors. One report claims that 10,000 North Korean troops have been dispatched to assist Russia. North Korean troops, as we previously noted, have already been killed in Ukraine. While Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Thursday dismissed claims of Pyongyang sending military personnel to fight in Ukraine as a 'hoax,' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky insisted that it is happening. 'We see an increasing alliance between Russia and regimes like North Korea,' Zelensky said during his evening address on Sunday. 'This is no longer just about transferring weapons. It is actually about transferring people from North Korea to the occupying military forces. Obviously, in such circumstances, our relations with partners need to develop further.' On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin submitted a draft law to the Russian State Duma seeking ratification of a strategic partnership between Moscow and Pyongyang, hammered in June. It calls for each side to provide military assistance to each other in the event of war. 'In the event that one of the Parties is subjected to an armed attack by a State or several States and thus finds it in a state of war, the other Party will immediately provide military and other assistance with all available means at its disposal, in accordance with Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations and in accordance with the legislation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Russian Federation,' the agreement stated. While the western world maintains a strategy of wishing it will all go away, Putin solidifies North Korea as the weapons manufacturing department of his terror coalition, submitting for ratification the mutual defense treaty between the two countries. KyivPost (@KyivPost) October 15, 2024 All this comes in the wake of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un’s visit to Russia last year for a summit with Putin where the two men bolstered their deepening ties with a shadowy arms deal. It was reported that, among other things, it called for Pyongyang to send construction and engineering forces to Russia-occupied territories of Ukraine for rebuilding work. There was no indication of how many personnel would be involved or the exact nature of their work. It is unclear whether that actually occurred. There are several reasons why a mutual aid pact could be highly attractive to both parties. It benefits North Korea in several ways. The cash-starved nation can receive economic and military assistance from Russia by providing its biggest available resource - personnel - in return. It could also gain real-world combat experience on a relatively modern battlefield, something its troops have not had in decades. Pyongyang has already been sanctioned by the U.S. for sending forced labor to distant counties as a way of raising money for the regime. North Korean troops fighting Ukraine help Russia make up for what the Pentagon said is the loss of some 600,000 troops killed and wounded since the beginning of the all-out invasion. It also assists Putin in avoiding an unpopular larger conscription, according to the Kyiv Post, citing sources in the Ukrainian Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR). 'Putin is doing everything possible to delay and avoid the decision to conduct a new full-fledged wave of mobilization on the territory of the Russian Federation,' the publication reported. Last month, GUR commander Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov said Russia was facing a troop shortfall. 'In this period (in the summer of 2025), they will face a dilemma - either to announce mobilization or in some way it is necessary to reduce the intensity of hostilities a little, which may, in the end, be critical for them,' he said, according to the Interfax news outlet. How well North Korean troops will perform is an open question. About 18 have already fled their positions in Kursk and Bryansk, according to the Ukrainian Suspine news outlet. 18 servicemen from North Korea reportedly escaped from Russian positions on the border of Bryansk region and Kursk region, Ukraine's Suspilnyi reports, citing intelligence sources.The reasons for the escape have not been established. Russian Army has launched a search. pic.twitter.com/BMQNCxSKnL&mdash; Clash Report (@clashreport) October 15, 2024 Another huge issue is language, said Kovalenko. 'Less than 1% of the personnel officers of the army of the DPRK speak Russian,' he noted. 'This is important to understand in order to analyze the possibilities of involving these military personnel in the actions of the Russian army in the future.' North Korea is no stranger to foreign deployments. It sent a fighter squadron to back up its communist ally North Vietnam during that conflict, noted Samual Ramani, DPhil/PhD Intl Relations @UniofOxford Associate Fellow @RUSI_org and author 'Russia in Africa' and 'Putin's War on Ukraine.' It dispatched pilots to fly on Egyptian jets during the 1973 Arab-Israeli War and military trainers to back up Iran's forces during the Iran-Iraq War. 'North Korea simultaneously was carrying out an even higher intensity military campaign in Angola,' Ramani said on Twitter. 'About 3,000 North Korean troops and 1,000 advisors backed the Angolan MPLA alongside Cuba and against apartheid South Africa's forces.' Pyongyang provided military assistance to other African nations as well, including Mozambique and Zimbabwe. 'Post-Cold War, North Korea's interventions dried up but training (including allegedly of Hezbollah on tunnel building) persisted Syria was a theatre where the Chalma brigades fought on Bashar al-Assad's behalf,' Ramani wrote. North Korea has been accused of sending forces to UkraineNorth Korea has a long history of deploying forces to overseas conflictsHere's the whole history /1&mdash; Samuel Ramani (@SamRamani2) October 14, 2024 While relatively small numbers of troops from other nations help both sides in this conflict, there has been no large-scale mobilization of foreign forces for either party. North Korea sending thousands of soldiers to help Russia would be a major change in that status quo, although just how much effect they could have remains unclear.

Oshkosh Talks Its 30mm Cannon-Wielding Medium Caliber Weapon Syst...	Oshkosh Defense’s 30mm Medium Caliber Weapon System (MCWS), integrated with the Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicle Double V Hull, offers what the company calls 'a transformative lethality solution for the U.S. Army.' Since the MCWS contract award in 2021, Oshkosh has partnered with the Army to incorporate a range of features designed specifically for the Stryker mission. The MCWS turret leverages the proven Rafael Samson Remote Weapon System and Fire Control System, providing heavy firepower with its XM813 30mm cannon and M240 coaxial weapon, as well as increased engagement range and enhanced situational awareness, all without compromising the Stryker’s mobility and survivability. The Stryker MCWS will replace the predecessor Infantry Carrier Vehicle – Dragoon (ICVD). Soldiers recently had a chance to test the MCWS during Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation (FOT&E), which assessed operational effectiveness and suitability in realistic conditions. Oshkosh Defense is actively delivering vehicles to the U.S. Army to ensure the timely fielding to the first Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT) in early 2025, marking a key milestone in the program.

Joint German-Italian Battle Tank Venture Could Shake Up European ...	Two major defense players from Italy and Germany have teamed up to build tanks and infantry fighting vehicles, initially aimed to meet the requirements of the Italian Army, but also for other customers, as armored warfare makes a resurgence in Europe and elsewhere. Under a 50:50 joint venture announced today, and following on from an earlier corresponding Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), Leonardo Rheinmetall Military Vehicles (LRMV) will develop and then build a version of Rheinmetall company’s KF51 Panther main battle tank and KF41 Lynx infantry fighting vehicle for the Italian Army. Thereafter, the two firms will market the vehicles to other potential customers. Whilst not a contract award, the establishment of the joint venture suggests it’s highly likely that the Panther and Lynx will be the platforms of choice for Italy, especially as other possible candidates have dropped out of the running. Should that happen, the two solutions from LRMV be chosen, as seems likely, the Panther will replace the Italian Army’s current fleet of locally made Ariete main battle tanks, developed in the 1980s. Italian Army Ariete tanks during an exercise at Capo Teulada in October 2022. Italian Army Meanwhile, the Lynx infantry fighting vehicle would be at the center of the Italian Army’s Armored Infantry Combat System (AICS) program, replacing the current Dardo IFVs, and surviving Cold War-era M113 armored personnel carriers. AICS is a wide-ranging effort that will eventually field as many as 16 different variants, including recovery, combat engineer, and bridge-laying vehicles. Italian Army troops exiting a Dardo infantry fighting vehicle. Italian Army The AICS also includes specialized combat vehicles, among them reconnaissance and anti-tank versions, as well as ones fitted with the Skyranger air defense system, reflecting the growing importance of short-range air defenses to deal with drones and other battlefield aerial threats. A prototype KF41 Lynx fitted with a Skyranger 30mm air defense turret. Rheinmetall Angela Micheletto LRMV determines that all its AICS vehicles will be based on the Lynx infantry fighting vehicle version, benefiting from the modular nature of its design. The AICS initiative calls for advanced features including open architecture, significant command-and-control capability, and the ability to share targeting data with a variety of other platforms. The fighting vehicles will also be expected to work alongside drones and uncrewed ground vehicles and to engage targets with different rounds, including airburst types. Scalable armor and other protective systems will defend them against improvised explosive devices, anti-tank missiles, and swarming drones, among other threats. . The Italian Army has a requirement for over one thousand AICS vehicles of all types. Reportedly, Italy plans to build 20 prototypes of the AICS by 2027 or 2028, with deliveries to begin between 2029 and 2041. Production of all vehicles for Italy — Panther and AICS — will be primarily handled at a new plant in La Spezia, Italy. This facility will be responsible for 60 percent of the manufacture of all vehicles. Italy’s Leonardo will also be responsible for the mission systems, electronics suites, and weapons integration on all vehicles ordered for the Italian Army. 'We are creating a new heavyweight in European tank production,' said Armin Papperger, CEO of Rheinmetall. 'Leonardo and Rheinmetall, two leading European suppliers of defense technology, are joining forces to carry out ambitious projects. We are primarily addressing the Italian market, but we will also be targeting other partner nations which are in need of modernizing their combat systems in the future. Rheinmetall has the perfect technologies for Italy’s requirements.' Meanwhile, Roberto Cingolani, CEO of Leonardo, described the joint venture as 'a significant step towards the creation of a European defense system based on specialized shared platforms. Rheinmetall and Leonardo aim at developing state-of-the-art technologies able to compete at international level.' A prototype KF41 Lynx with the Skyranger 30mm air defense turret. Rheinmetall Today’s announcement is also a significant turnaround for Italian Army armored vehicle development and one that could have major repercussions across the continent. Before Leonardo teamed up with Rheinmetall, it had planned to develop and build new fighting vehicles for Italy in partnership with KNDS. KNDS is a European defense company that came from the merger between Germany’s Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and France’s Nexter Systems. Under the earlier agreement, Leonardo and KNDS would have jointly produced Leopard 2 main battle tanks (originally designed by Krauss-Maffei Wegmann) for the Italian Army. Lynx KF41 infantry fighting vehicle. Rheinmetall The Italian parliament had even approved the Leopard 2 purchase, before the collapse of the partnership, which came about when KNDS reportedly rejected Leonardo’s plans to install a significant proportion of its own systems on the tanks. By going with Rheinmetall and the still-in-development KF51 Panther, Italy should be able to tailor the tank more closely to its own requirements. On the other hand, while the Leopard 2 was an off-the-shelf product that would have been able to be fielded fairly rapidly by the Italian Army, the service will have to wait longer for the Panther — perhaps as long as 10 years, according to some accounts. That long timeline also raises the possibility of a clash of rival European tank designs. While Rheinmetall introduced its Panther as a private venture project, Germany and France had meanwhile teamed up on a political level to push the development of another new main battle tank, the more ambitious Main Ground Combat System (MGCS). MGCS is set to replace German Leopard 2 and French Leclerc main battle tanks and was due to arrive in service beginning in 2035. While a technology demonstrator for the MGCS program, the Enhanced Main Battle Tank, combining Leclerc and Leopard 2 components, was unveiled in 2018, progress since then has been slow.

As TWZ has discussed in the past, a larger 130mm or 140mm gun would certainly offer improved range and armor penetration capabilities. Earlier this year, KNDS rolled out a new version of the Leopard 2 with a completely uncrewed turret that can be armed with a 140mm main gun. KNDS plans to offer the tank for sale but also expects it to be a key stepping stone to the next-generation MGCS. A Leopard 2 demonstrator with an uncrewed turret armed with a 140mm main gun. KNDS Notably, the KF51 Panther is armed with a 130mm caliber main gun. Having Italy choose the Panther is a major vote of confidence that might lead to it forming the basis of the MGCS, but that might well not be a satisfying result for Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, in particular, which is currently still building the Leopard 2 and would want to stay firmly in the MBT game, perhaps with an up-gunned Leopard 2 or a derivative for MGCS. In the meantime, the value of the Italian procurement will be significant. When it was still planning to buy Leopard 2s, Italy expected the acquisition program would be worth around $8.6 billion, for 270 tanks, while another $16 billion would be invested in the AICS program.

Photo by Craig Stennett/Getty Images Craig Stennett An armored vehicle spending spree of this kind would have been surprising only a few years ago, but Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has dramatically changed the defense and security landscape in Europe. In particular, with tank warfare being a prominent feature of the fighting in Ukraine, the idea of investing in new main battle tank fleets, as well as spending on armored fighting vehicles in general, has made a comeback. As we noted in our previous discussion of the Panther, the design of this tank seems to be especially relevant for this new era. Overall, it should be lighter and more agile than current main battle tanks, while carrying a bigger main gun, and having the ability to provide stand-in surveillance and strike with loitering munitions. This addresses some of the concerns about the vulnerability of tanks to various weapons, especially loitering munitions and first-person view (FPV) drones, which have played a prominent role in Ukraine. With Italy looking now more likely than ever to emerge as the first customer for the KF51 Panther, this may well encourage further orders for the tank, as well as for the KF41 Lynx. Meanwhile, LRMV will be paying close attention to developments in the MGCS, with the Panther now looking well-positioned to make a challenge for this highly important program, too.

New Patriot Missile Interceptor Axed By Army	The U.S. Army is no longer pursuing a new interceptor for its Patriot surface-to-air missile systems. The disclosure as the service has also said it wants to reduce reliance on the highly in demand and heavily strained Patriot force and look more at tailored air defense force packages leveraging its Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS) network. Army Brig. Gen. Frank Lozano announced the decision regarding what had been known as the Lower-Tier Future Interceptor (LTFI), in a live interview with Defense News' Jen Judson from the floor of the Association of the U.S. Army's (AUSA) main annual conference. Lozano is head of the service's Program Executive Office for Missiles and Space. Gen Lozano, PEO Missiles & Space, tells @JenJudson that they have cancelled the Lower Tier Future Interceptor program, which would have succeeded the PAC-3 MSE. Instead they will upgrade MSE, and want to move forward with THAAD integration into IBCS. #AUSA2024 pic.twitter.com/NZMPgDH4KP&mdash; Colby Badhwar (@ColbyBadhwar) October 15, 2024 'So, right now, the Army has decided that we are not going to move forward on what we were calling a Lower Tier Future Interceptor,' Lozano told Judson. 'That was going to be a very expensive endeavor. &#8230; Interceptors in that family or class of interceptors are very capable, but also very expensive.' The Army had previously defined 'lower-tier' in this instance as the 'lower tier portion of the ballistic missile defense battlespace' and described the LTFI as being set to help 'increase Air and Missile Defense (AMD) capability through increased velocity, altitude, and maneuverability.' Lozano did not elaborate on cost, but the unit price of a PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) interceptor, the most advanced type now available for Patriot, is just under $4.2 million, according to Army budget documents. 'After going through a business case analysis within the PEO and with the Army senior leaders, what we've decided to do is, one, look at continuing to upgrade the PAC-3 MSE missile, which I believe is probably the best air defense missile in the world, [and] continue to advance that capability so that it can remain relevance against the evolving threats,' Lozano added. The PAC-3 MSE is already a substantial improvement over precious PAC-3 variants, as you can read about in more detail here. Current Patriot launchers can also be loaded with a mix of PAC-3 MSEs and older interceptor types. An overview of the improvements found on the PAC-3 MSE variant over its predecessors. Lockheed Martin An overview of the improvements found on the PAC-3 MSE variant over its predecessors, including a 'New LE [lethality enhancer].' Lockheed Martin A graphic highlighting the ability to load multiple types of interceptors onto a single Patriot launcher. Lockheed Martin A complete Patriot battery today can consist of up to eight launchers, along with an AN/MPQ-65 multifunction phased array radar and various fire control, communications, and other support equipment. The Army is also in the process of adding a new radar, called the Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS), to the Patriot ecosystem. In addition, Lozano said that the Army has been looking more at how the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) ballistic missile defense system can directly complement Patriot thanks to the new ICBS network. Developed by Northrop Grumman, IBCS is designed to offer an open-architecture command and control and networking environment to link together various air defense sensors and effectors, as you can learn more about here. 'What that would allow us to do is create a tighter coupling between the THAAD system and the Patriot system and via that tighter coupling, then you can manage the battle space in a much more efficient way,' Lozano told Judson. 'You could launch a THAAD interceptor against a particular target and then, as backup, launch a PAC-3 interceptor and it opens up the amount of battle space that you can use to take advantage of two interceptors against a very stressing threat&#8230; and in that same vein maintain the magazine depth of both family of interceptors.' The Missile Defense Agency (MDA), in cooperation with the Army and others, has been experimenting with the integration of components of the THAAD and Patriot systems in recent years. The decision to axe the LFTI effort also highlights broader discussions the Army is having now about the future of its Patiort force, which has been and continues to be in extremely high demand, but also too small to adequately meet those operational needs. The total number of THAAD batteries is even smaller and that system is also managed outside of the Army by the MDA. These are issues The War Zone has highlighted in the past, including just yesterday in the context of the emergency THAAD deployment to Israel. A THAAD transporter-erector-launcher is loaded onto a US Air Force C-17A Globemaster III transport aircraft at Fort Sill, Texas, bound for Israel as part of a training exercise in 2019. DOD The Army is looking to expand its Patriot force, but also scale back its use. 'We have relied too long on the Patriot system as the centric system to air and missile defense,' Army Lt. Gen. Sean Gainey, head of that service’s Space and Missile Defense Command (SDMC), said during a panel discussion at AUSA yesterday. 'We are modernizing now with the short-range air defense and moving forward with our IFPC [Indirect Fire Protection Capability] cruise missile defense, and our improvements to our current system[s], with the integration into IBCS, it will eventually start to relieve that significant stress.' The IFPC program, and the Enduring Shield system at the center of it, is a particularly significant part of the Army's broader air and missile defense modernization plans. The primary interceptor for Enduring Shield, which the service is working toward fielding operationally now, is the AIM-9X Sidewinder. An palletized Enduring Shield launcher. Leidos There are already plans for a second interceptor for Enduring Shield that is more optimized for the counter-cruise missile role. The Army has publicly laid out a vision for a design that offers capabilities akin to the AIM-120D Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), but in the same form factor as the AIM-9X. Whatever the new interceptor might look like, it could give Enduring Shield an expanded medium-range air and missile defense capability. The Army's current lack of a surface-to-air missile system in this middle tier has added to the strain on the Patriot force, which has filled this gap since the retirement of the Hawk system in the 1990s. The Army is also looking to deploy and employ all of its ground-based air defense capabilities in more tailored and potentially disaggregated ways in the future, thanks in large part to the power of the IBCS network. 'The force structure that we are building and growing is tailorable, it's adaptable, and it is able to kind of flexibly meet whatever needs we have in any hotspot in the world,' Gabe Camarillo, Under Secretary of the Army, said at the same AUSA panel yesterday as Lt. Gen. Gainey. 'We can compose this in any shape or fashion.' 'What I want to be able to do is to be able to provide a Chinese menu, if you will, to combatant commanders, so that once they perform their assessment of the threat, they can say, 'Frank, give me three of those, one of those, 10 of those, four of those,'' Brig. Gen. Lozano, another member of the panel, also said. 'And we deliver that capability, integrated and able to function and work together to defeat any threat any given Combat Commander faces.' There are questions about how realistic this kind of mission-to-mission tailoring of air defense force packages might be in terms of maintaining readiness and cohesion, especially when it comes to training and otherwise preparing disparate units to work together down range. The Army does seem to be betting heavily on the ability of IBCS to allow the rapid fuzing of different air and missile defense capabilities down-range. At the panel yesterday, Brig. Gen. Lozano shared an anecdote about how lessons learned from the ongoing war in Ukraine are reinforcing the service's focus on IBCS: 'About a year and a half ago, I took a trip over to Poland to visit Ukrainian soldiers training on the first two batteries of Patriot that we were donating to them. One was a U.S. battery, one was a German battery. Had the privilege of eating lunch with some of those Ukrainian Air defenders. And at the end of that lunch, I asked them, I'm curious, &#8230; based on your employment of Patriot, and Avenger, and Hawk, and Stinger MANPAD [man portable air defense] systems, NASAMS [National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System], how are you managing the battle space to ensure you have the most efficient application of combat power against the threats that Russia is throwing at you. And they said, you know, sir, you've hit on our most significant struggle. If there was a way that we had a system that could integrate all of those capabilities that would make us much more effective in that employment of combat power. Do you have something you can give us? And I said, Well, I can't get ahead of the President. I'm not allowed to offer anything up, but I will tell you that we've recognized that same thing. And so when a lot of people ask me, what are some of the most important lessons that we've learned from Ukraine, from an air and missile defense perspective, what has been reaffirming to me is that the modernization path that we are on is exactly the right path to be on.' The video below highlights various Western-supplied and other air defense systems in service in Ukraine, including Patriot. The fighting in Ukraine has also broadly underscored the importance of layered integrated air defense networks capable of tackling multiple tiers of threats, from kamikaze drones to ballistic missiles, and doing so simultaneously. Much still remains to be seen about how the Army's air and missile defense force structure evolves going forward. At the same time, it is clear that major developments in terms of capabilities, as well as tactics, techniques, and procedures, are still on the horizon despite the end of plans for the next-generation interceptor for Patriot.

China’s Large Tiltrotor Drone Breaks Cover	China has revealed the first example of a new tiltrotor drone, United Aircraft’s UR6000, that has clear military potential, despite initially being pitched for civilian missions. The drone is notably large, providing a very useful load-carrying capability, and relatively offering high-speed and long-range. The photo, seen at the top of this story, dated October 11, shows what is said to be the first completed UR6000 prototype on the production line at the Wuhu United Aircraft Production Workshop in the Wuhu Aviation Industrial Park in China’s eastern Anhui province. A placard in front of the aircraft states that this is 'the first machine delivered off the line.' An official confirmed earlier this year that the project was at that time in the early prototyping phase. United Aircraft The UR6000 project — also apparently known as the R6000 and as the Zhang Ying, or Steel Shadow — was originally launched at the Singapore Airshow earlier this year when a less-than-detailed conceptual model was presented. Featuring high-mounted wings of constant chord, the UR6000 has tilting three-blade proprotors in engine nacelles mounted on the wingtips. It appears that the design has copied Bell’s new-generation tiltrotor technology, as used in the V-280 Valor, where instead of the whole nacelle rotating, only the front portion pivots. This solution is said to decrease complexity and increase reliability, as well as performance, compared with earlier tiltrotor concepts where the whole nacelle rotates, like on the V-22 Osprey. The V-280 Valor demonstrator during a test flight. Bell The Valor demonstrator during a test flight. (Bell) The U-shaped tail has a plank-like horizontal tailplane with a large vertical stabilizer mounted on each end. Two large canard-like surfaces are mounted just aft of the cockpit. Although these appear to be mainly intended to accommodate the main landing gear, it's possible they could perhaps also be used to mount smaller stores or sensors. Initial concept artwork shows a large cargo door on the port side, located toward the aft section of the fuselage. At this stage, the powerplant for the UR6000 is unclear, although it is certainly planned to be powered by turboshaft engines. Initial assessments suggest that each engine will be rated at between 1,500 and 2,000 horsepower and that a variable-speed gearbox is used to manage the different power requirements for vertical and horizontal flight modes. United Aircraft has released some provisional specifications for the tiltrotor drone. These include a maximum takeoff weight of 13,448 pounds (6,100 kilograms), a payload capacity of 4,409 pounds (2,000 kilograms), a cruise speed of 432 miles an hour (550 kilometers an hour), a service ceiling of 25,000 feet (7,620 meters), and a maximum range of 932 miles (1,500 kilometers). How accurate these numbers end being is yet to be seen. Reportedly, development of the UR6000 began in 2021 and certification is expected to be completed by 2027. It seems the next milestone could be at the Zhuhai Air Show later this year, with reports that the prototype of the tiltrotor drone will be formally unveiled there. #ZhuhaiAirShow2024 get readyWorld's first 6 ton tilt-rotor huge UAV 'Steel Shadow' R6000to be unveiled pic.twitter.com/4cunj4WEL0&mdash; Húrin (@Hurin92) October 2, 2024 The UR6000 is described by the manufacturer as an autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV), however, there are also reports that, in the longer term, the design will be adapted to carry up to 10 passengers as an alternative to cargo. That indicates that a larger crewed version of the tiltrotor is also envisaged. Concept artwork of an apparent crewed version of the UR6000 in a generic civil-type color scheme. United Aircraft At this stage, the tiltrotor drone is being pitched for civilian missions, although it would seem to have obvious military applications too. At least one picture on United Aircraft’s website now shows the UR6000 in People’s Liberation Army (PLA) markings. United Aircraft While United Aircraft is not among the largest Chinese aerospace entities, it does have considerable experience designing and building rotary-wing drones, including smaller quadcopters as well as larger types with coaxial rotor arrangements. These are primarily intended for logistics and surveillance, as well as firefighting and emergency response.

Its accommodation for 10, passengers also compares closely with the AW609’s seating for up to 12 passengers in a high-density configuration. Leonardo's AW609 tiltrotor conducts shipboard trials aboard the Italian aircraft carrier ITS Cavour. Leonardo Leonardo In the military realm, the UR6000 also makes an interesting comparison with Bell’s V-247 Vigilant, which was originally pitched to meet the U.S. Marine Corps multirole, VTOL-capable drone program, known as MUX. The Marines wanted MUX to have a minimum internal payload capacity of 3,000 pounds, the ability to carry between 3,000 to 9,000 pounds of weapons or other stores externally, a cruising speed between 230 and 345 miles per hour, an unrefueled combat radius of 350 to 700 miles, and the ability to refuel in flight. In its original form, the V-247 was designed with a maximum gross weight of over 30,000 pounds, but this has since been downsized to about 28,000 pounds to satisfy U.S. Navy requirements, including operating from smaller-deck warships. Vigilant’s long-range cruise is now listed as 240 knots with a maximum continuous cruising speed of 300 knots. Its redesigned internal mission payload is 2,000 pounds and it has a 9,000-pound slingload capacity. A proposed U.S. Navy version of Bell’s V-247 Vigilant. Bell It's very possible that the PLA may order further specific military modifications of the UR6000 to suit its requirements. The tiltrotor could also join a growing family of fixed-wing Chinese transport drones that have dual-role civilian and military applications. A tiltrotor drone, in particular, could well be suitable for a range of missions, especially in the Indo-Pacific theater, in which access to conventional airstrips would likely be limited in wartime and there is an enduring requirement to deliver cargoes to remote locations like Chinese island outposts in the South China Sea. While the U.S. military is increasingly looking at how to best address expeditionary missions in this environment, it’s also of huge importance for the PLA, as it seeks to expand its reach across the Pacific, including operations from small island airstrips as well as a growing fleet of amphibious assault ships that would be ideal platforms for the UR6000. Potentially offering long-range and fast-cruising, as well as a significant payload capacity for a VTOL drone, the UR6000 is certainly an intriguing although somewhat familiar design. Moreover, it’s one that would appear to be eminently suited to island-hopping operations of the kind considered likely in a future large-scale conflict in the Indo-Pacific. Above all else, it shows China's real interest in breaking into the larger tiltrotor realm.

BriteStorm Miniature Electronic Warfare System Can Allow Small Dr...	A new miniature electronic warfare jammer that is relatively low-cost enough to be a payload on loyal wingman-type drones and even expandable loitering munitions has hit the market from defense contractor Leonardo. Focused on stand-in jamming, the BriteStorm payload is based on technology pioneered in the BriteCloud air-launched decoy, which The War Zone has covered in detail in the past. Like its predecessor, BriteStorm can scoop up hostile radar emissions and emulate returns to create large numbers of false and confusing 'ghost' tracks and can also execute more traditional jamming, with even more adaptive capabilities on the horizon. Leonardo, which is headquartered in Italy, officially unveiled BriteStorm at the Association of the U.S. Army's main annual conference, which opened today in Washington, D.C. The company's subsidiary based in the United Kingdom has led the development of the new jammer, as well as the preceding BriteCloud decoy. 'A standard BriteStorm fit incorporates a platform-specific antenna, transmit-receive modules and Leonardo’s Miniature Technique Generator,' according to a press release today from Leonardo. BriteStorm weighs just five and a half pounds (two and a half kilograms), the company also told Breaking Defense. This is small, but still substantially heavier than the soda can-sized BriteCloud, which weighs just over a pound (or half a kilogram). From left to right, examples of a BriteStorm antenna, transmit-receive module, and Miniature Technique Generator. Leonardo 'BriteStorm is platform agnostic&#8230; You can put it on almost anything, as long as it has a payload bay and the power of equivalent of something like a Humvee battery,' Michael Lea, Vice President Of Sales for Electronic Warfare at Leonardo, told The War Zone and other attendees at AUSA. 'And when it comes to price, BriteStorm has been designed to sit at a point that makes it attritable. &#8230; [meaning it] is not prohibitively expensive, and it won't cause a major strategic, strategic issue if lost.' Lea did not further elaborate on cost. BriteStorm is focused on providing stand-in jamming support – which Leonardo defines as an 'airborne electronic warfare capability, deployed ahead of the main force, to deliver high-powered interference against a wide spectrum of threats' – while installed on any of a variety of different platforms. 'By doing so, BriteStorm degrades the enemy’s IADS [integrated air defense system network], supressing its ability to detect and lock onto other platforms, protecting friendly forces and enabling their mission,' according to a company press release. When it comes to how the system works, regardless of what it is installed on, 'BriteStorm is the first stand-in jammer on the market to use the gold-standard digital radio frequency memory, or DRFM, technology, which means it can record the pulse of an enemy radar system perfectly,' Lea added. 'The pulse is then manipulated and projected back, confusing the enemy and significantly degrading their situational awareness.' BriteStorm's DRFM capabilities are based on those found on the BriteCloud decoy, which has been seeing increasing sales worldwide, most recently as a new addition to the F-35 stealth fighter's array of radiofrequency countermeasures. It is worth noting here Leonardo's division in the United Kingdom has also been supplying the electronic warfare payload for the still-in-development stand-in jammer derivative of the Select Precision Effects At Range Capability Three (SPEAR-3) mini-cruise missile from European consortium MBDA. The SPEAR-EW version has been leveraging past work on BriteCloud. 'BriteStorm is highly effective against radars in the NATO A to J bands,' the Leonardo executive continued. 'This means that BriteStorm is effective against all types of&#8230; surveillance, target acquisition, and tracking radars.' As The War Zone has highlighted in the past with regard to BriteCloud, DRFM's signal mimicry can take the form of entire fleets of illusionary targets, not only confusing, but overwhelming radar operators. Integrated onto aerial drones or other uncrewed platforms, the new BriteStorm jammers could also be sent into a target area from multiple different vectors at once, creating additional problems for enemy defenders trying to prioritize their resources. Leonardo says that BriteStorm can also work by using more traditional jamming functionality, 'barraging the enemy system with electronic noise.' A graphic depicting BriteStorm installed on a notional drone. Leonardo As such, BriteStorm jammers could help shield friendly crewed and uncrewed aircraft, as well as cruise missiles, from hostile air defenses, including drawing away surface-to-air missiles from the primary force. Just stimulating the enemy's defenses could help assets tasked with suppression and destruction of enemy air defenses, allowing them to cut a clear path to a target area for incoming strikers. Leonardo's LEA specifically highlighted the U.S. Army's Air Launch Effects (ALE) and Future Tactical Uncrewed Aircraft System (FTUAS) programs, the U.S. Air Force's Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) program, and the United Kingdom's Autonomous Collaborative Platforms (ACP) drone program as ones that the company is now eying as potential opportunities for BriteStorm. Leonardo has three unspecified aerial assets in the United States now that it is using to demonstrate the capability to potential customers. In the United Kingdom, the Royal Air Force's (RAF) Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO) has already taken delivery of several BriteStorm payloads and has conducted some degree of flight testing. Leonardo already conducted at least one test back in 2020 in cooperation with the RAF RCO that involved a group of drones employing BriteCloud decoys against a mock enemy integrated air defense network. A graphic Leonardo released as part of its announcement of the 2020 test. Leonardo 'We're having quite interesting conversations with a number of end users about CONOPS [concepts of operations] for operation of BriteStorm at the moment,' Leonardo's Lea said. 'And I think it's fair to say that in the world of CCA and ACP, coalition forces are trying to work out the right force mix between large, exquisite platforms, uncrewed platforms, and then potential attritable platforms, as well.' In addition, 'BriteStorm is supplied with a very comprehensive mission data and generation tool. And you can observe the effects BriteStorm&#8230; has on opposition radars, and then reprogram it, depending on what you've seen and the threat that's out there,' Michael Lea from Leonardo explained today. 'We are looking again in the capability roadmap, about how you may change the waveforms that BriteStorm can generate by connecting it back to other systems, which are elsewhere.' Responding to a question at the roll-out presentation at AUSA from The War Zone's Jamie Hunter about whether this might mean the system could be reprogrammed on the fly, representatives from Leonardo said the current plan is for any changes to be made in between missions. No mention was made of so-called cognitive electronic warfare capabilities in regard to BriteStorm, but remote updating of systems in the middle of operations to respond to new and evolving threats is a key part of that overall concept. An electronic warfare suite that can process incoming signals and autonomously adjust its outputs to be most effective in response without any outside input is the absolute 'holy grail' that the concept envisions, as you can read more about here. No explicit mention was made today about networking BriteStorms together, but doing so would provide critical additional capability. A networked group of platforms carrying the electronic warfare systems would have synergistic effects. It would make it harder for an opponent to realize they've been deceived and how, with multiple coordinated EW tactics occurring over a broad area and from different vectors and platforms. A grouping like this would also be more resilient to attacks since it would still be able to continue its electronic attacks even if some of the platforms in the network are lost. A graphic depicting BriteStorm installed on different tiers of drones. Leonardo It's interesting to point out here that the U.S. Navy has been pushing ahead in recent years with plans for a similar-sounding distributed and deeply networked electronic warfare ecosystem that includes uncrewed decoys and other nodes capable of mimicking friendly forces to protect them from threats and deceive opponents. The Navy has referred to this concept in the past as the Netted Emulation of Multi-Element Signature against Integrated Sensors, or NEMESIS, which The War Zone was first to really report on. We have highlighted in the past that some of these developments might help explain some number of sightings of so-called unexplained aerial phenomena (UAP). Furthermore, Leonardo's unveiling BriteStorm at the AUSA conference raises the question of whether the system might be usable against target sets beyond enemy air defense networks. Preventing enemy counter-battery radars from getting an accurate fix on artillery units or coastal radars from spotting and tracking ships at sea would also be valuable capabilities to have. More generally, BriteStorm reflects a broad resurgence of demand in the West, especially within the U.S. military, in higher-end electronic warfare capabilities that had increasingly fallen into disuse after decades of counter-terrorism and other lower-intensity missions. American officials now regularly talk about how dominating in the electromagnetic spectrum will be a key factor in succeeding in future high-end fights, such as one in the Pacific against China. The ongoing war in Ukraine has only provided further evidence of the importance of various tiers of electronic warfare capabilities, as well as an important source of more direct lessons learned for the United States and others. How and where BriteStorm may be fielded operationally in the future remains to be seen, but the U.S. military and other armed forces globally have clear and still-growing interest in the kinds of distributed electronic warfare capabilities it has to offer.

Emergency THAAD Deployment To Israel Heightens Concerns On Strain...	Sending one of the U.S. Army’s seven prized Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) batteries to Israel highlights the strain on the service’s air defense systems and personnel, which are increasingly deployed around the globe. This is a glaring issue we explored in-depth nearly a year ago, which you can read about here. Since then, the demand for these systems has only increased, especially now that Israel and Iran are trading escalating blows and as the threat from China looms larger in the Pacific with each passing day. The deteriorating security situation in Europe and Ukraine's massive appetite for air defenses is also a major factor stressing America's organic air defense capacity. While the deployment of the THAAD battery and about 100 soldiers to Israel will not add 'a tremendous amount of additional strain broadly to the community…the air defense artillery community is the most stressed,' Army Secretary Christine Wormuth told reporters Monday, including from The War Zone. 'They have the highest [operational tempo]…and what we are trying to do to manage that is two things.' Lt. Gen. Patrick Frank, U.S. Army Central Commanding General, meets with a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) crew next to a launcher emplaced and prepared to launch interceptors to counter ballistic missile threats at an undisclosed location in the CENTCOM Area of Operations, Dec. 12, 2023. (U.S. Army Courtesy Photo) The first is 'modernizing our integrated air and missile defenses to try to create more capacity,' said Wormuth, speaking at a reporter’s roundtable at the 2024 AUSA Conference in Washington D.C. One step toward that goal is moving toward the integration of the Patriot battery’s new Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS) into the Army’s Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS) network. LTAMDS is designed to provide higher-fidelity sensing capability at much further distances and process a wider array of data more quickly than the Patriot's current radar. It can also offer 360-degree coverage, which the current system cannot. The IBCS connects various sensors to effectors like, gun systems, lasers, missile systems, and electronic warfare capabilities and combines all this data on the entire air defense situation into a single actionable 'picture' for operators. The combination is meant to give air defenders a much greater ability to better react to and if necessary shoot down a multitude of threats at once. 'That will greatly increase the capacity of the existing Patriot force that we have, and that will help reduce some of the stress on our soldiers,' the Secretary explained. Patriot batteries are especially stretched, with the need for training, testing, maintenance and upgrades back at home competing with increasing obligations abroad. The other line of effort is 'constantly trying to be disciplined as we can' in providing inputs to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin so he can 'accurately assess the strain on the force when he's considering future operational deployment. We have to be as choosy as we can be about what we take on.' That is easier said than done, however. In this case, the THAAD battery and troops are being sent to bolster Israel’s defenses as it faces glaringly real ballistic missile threats from Iran and some of the higher-end ballistic missiles Iran has provided Hezbollah. The announcement of its pending delivery comes ahead of an expected Israeli retaliation for Tehran’s massive missile barrage earlier this month.

A THAAD battery can include up to nine transporter-erector-launchers, each carrying eight interceptors at the ready, as well as a long-range AN/TPY-2 X-band radar, a mobile fire control and command and control center, and various supporting equipment. Additional interceptors would be available to reload the launchers during a combat deployment, as well. A briefing slide showing the general composition of THAAD batteries as of 2016., MDA THAAD is designed to intercept short-, medium, and intermediate-range ballistic missiles during their terminal phase of flight when they are plunging toward their target. The system sits at the top-end of air defense systems capable of terminal phase air defense, which include Patriot, the SM-6, and Israel's Stunner. THAAD can reach up higher and is capable of swatting down faster threats, like longer-range ballistic missiles. The system made its first combat kill in 2020, defending the United Arab Emirates from a ballistic missile launched by Houthi rebels of Yemen. A basic overview of where THAAD fits into the missile defense ecosystem. (MDA) THAADs are in short supply and extremely high demand. In addition to the THAAD battery being sent to Israel, the Army shipped a THAAD battery to the Middle East region shortly after the surprise Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas incursion into southern Israel amid fears that the conflict could erupt into a regional war. In addition, two more are also deployed outside of the continental United States, one in South Korea and one on the U.S. island of Guam in the Western Pacific. THAAD has also been sent on deployments to Europe in recent years. The Army is currently hoping to field an eighth THAAD battery by 2025. This is not the first time THAAD has been sent to Israel. As we reported in March 2019, the first time was part of a Pentagon effort to be able to quickly deploy capabilities and keep adversaries from having too much foreknowledge about U.S. military plans. THAAD's arrival there and the following exercises were very much to prepare for a similar situation as what Israel is facing now and Iran's ballistic missile capabilities have only grown more potent over the last half decade. Though a full THAAD battery was deployed to Israel for the first time five years ago, members of the U.S. Army’s 10th Army Air and Missile Defense Command have maintained the system's long-range AN/TPY-2 X-band radar at a so-called 'cooperative security location' known as Site 512 in Israel’s Negev Desert permanently at least since 2012. This little talked about arrangement means THAAD could deploy without the need to move its staple sensor system there. THAAD seen during its first deployment to Israel in 2019. DoD While Israel faces numerous aerial threats from Hezbollah, the Houthis and various Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and Syria, deploying a THAAD battery at this point seems to be a clear signal to Tehran that not only does the U.S. have Israel’s back, but it is willing to put additional troops and prized materiel on the ground to defend it. The U.S. has been building up capabilities in the region for months now, including other missile defense assets, namely destroyers capable of midcourse intercept of ballistic missiles, in an effort to deter Iran and be better ready to respond should a wider conflict erupt in the region. All that being said, given its capabilities, the THAAD battery would make a prime target for Iran or any of its proxies. But it will also be among the most defended assets in the region and Iran is already fully aware of Israel's strategic missile defense assets and installations. Still, with additional U.S. troops now in harms way, the possibility for a conflict widening if they are harmed is certainly elevated.

North Korea Sending GPS-Equipped Balloons Across The Border	Among the balloons being sent across the border from North Korea to the South are examples carrying GPS transmitters, according to the Republic of Korea military. Waves of excrement and trash-filled balloons have been sent over South Korea since the summer, but the latest development suggests that the North is also using them for limited intelligence-gathering, perhaps in preparation for future contingencies, or to develop more balloon-based military capabilities. The announcement comes only days after Pyongyang accused the South of sending multiple waves of drones over the North Korean capital to drop propaganda leaflets, as you can read about here. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff says that GPS transmitters were found in some of the North Korean balloons. Although it’s unclear when exactly these balloons were sent, there have been no previous reports of them carrying such devices, since the current campaign began.

Photo by ANTHONY WALLACE / AFP ANTHONY WALLACE A South Korean defense official said the military is 'tracking North Korea’s possible development of balloon flotation technology and preparing for contingencies.' The implication is that North Korea has been using the GPS data sent back by appropriately equipped balloons to study their flight data. A balloon of this kind cannot have its course altered based on returned GPS data, but the equipment could have other implications of varying degrees of impact. Tracking balloon movements over time would show North Korea the kinds of routes they are taking, how far they can travel, and at what speeds. By their nature, the balloons are very likely to be intact once they come down — provided they are not shot down — meaning that the signal can still be transmitted, at least until it descends below the recieving station's horizon. However, if the balloons are brought down by South Korean air defenses, resulting in a sudden loss of connectivity, it’s the resulting data could also help to highlight potential strong and weak spots in the country’s defensive coverage.

This was a city-wide civil defense exercise designed to better prepare for any future trash balloons, as well as North Korean drone attacks. Photo by ANTHONY WALLACE / AFP ANTHONY WALLACE Perhaps more significantly, the development could point to North Korea working on other new capabilities for its balloons. The utility of balloons for surveillance was clearly highlighted by a spate of incidents over North America in early 2023, including a high-altitude balloon originating from China. It's a reality TWZ has warned about in great detail before those instances, as well. If North Korea were to fit its balloons with intelligence-gathering equipment, this could provide valuable data. For example, fitting balloons with basic onboard electronic surveillance systems would allow them to send back signatures of air defense systems they detect and their azimuths. While the data might be simple, multiple balloons could allow emissions to be rapidly triangulated, which would help locate air defense radars and other critical nodes, for instance. At the same time, a balloon equipped to send back such data would also generate electromagnetic radiation, revealing its presence and location to electronic surveillance measures, although this can be mitigated to a degree by sending very simple data streams in small bursts and leverage commercial satellite communications is another possibility.

In the past, we have explored how such balloons could be deadly if filled with explosives, incendiary devices, radioactive materials, or chemical weapons, for example. GPS data, if comprehensive enough, could help North Korea develop tactics for sending balloons to the South with payloads of this kind, too. GPS can also be used to order the release of a balloon-borne weapon over certain predetermined areas. A campaign of this kind would not be accurate, but it would cause mayhem and havoc throughout the South, a primary goal of the North Koreans and something we explored in depth back in 2017. Were Pyongyang to launch a major cross-DMZ conflict, this could be just the kind of tactic that it would look for in combination with deep assaults into the South. Using balloons for lethal attacks is hardly new. Balloons carrying bombs and incendiary devices were a feature of World War II. As we have previously noted, Ukraine today also uses inflatable objects to drop explosives on Russians. The Ukrainian Armed Forces have launched a series of meteorological balloons equipped with explosives deep into Russia for the first time. One of them was intercepted by air defense systems in the Lipetsk region.According to Mash, a modified unmanned aerostat carrying kilograms… pic.twitter.com/0XjfgyzbSd&mdash; MD (@distant_earth83) April 17, 2024 Another option for North Korea would be to use balloons to help overwhelm the South’s formidable air defenses, in times of conflict. This would parallel Russia’s use of balloons with radar reflectors to stimulate, confuse and deplete Ukrainian air defenses. Just the fact that North Korea has displayed increasingly sophisticated use of basic balloons against the South makes them a real threat during a conflict, and thus would suck up precious air defense effectors. This is all in great contrast to North Korea’s balloon campaign up until now. This has involved payloads of trash as well as 'fecal matter and other contaminants.' As such, they have had mainly nuisance value, as well as providing a signal of Pyongyang’s ability to cause disruption in the South using the kinds of ‘gray zone’ tactics that inhabit the space between peace and war.

Photo by Anthony WALLACE / AFP ANTHONY WALLACE The number of balloons involved is also significant, with South Korean reports stating that some 260 balloons were launched by the North in one overnight action last May. This figure reflects the fact that balloons are relatively cheap and simple, making them more attractive for these kinds of operations. Concerns about the possible dangerous payloads have led to South Korea’s military deploying 'chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear response teams and bomb disposal units to collect the objects for a detailed analysis,' according to Yonhap. As far as North Korea is concerned, it has said that its balloon campaign is a response to propaganda balloons launched from the South, activities that have been primarily attributed to activists and North Korean defectors. Such balloons allegedly carry mainly aid parcels and leaflets condemning the North’s leadership. Last week, however, reports emerged of drones being launched from South Korea, apparently with the same purpose. North Korea said that South Korean drones were responsible for scattering a 'huge number' of leaflets with anti-North propaganda over its capital. Officials in Pyongyang described the action as a 'political and military provocation that could lead to armed conflict.' KCNA As TWZ reported at the time, Seoul didn’t admit responsibility for launching the leaflet-dropping drones, although this was a notably sophisticated operation for a group of volunteers or defectors — at least compared to drifting balloons. In particular, the drones would need considerable range, payload, and navigation capabilities to have specifically targeted Pyongyang and to have done so over several nights. At this point, it’s impossible to say whether North Korea’s GPS-equipped balloons are just an experiment or the sign of something more significant in the works. However, it is a useful innovation and may well not be the last we will see, as Pyongyang continues its balloon campaign amid growing tensions on the peninsula.
