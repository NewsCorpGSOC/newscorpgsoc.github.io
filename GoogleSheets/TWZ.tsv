Weaponizing Space Key To Trump’s Iron Dome Missile Defense Shield...	President Donald Trump has laid out a vision for a new Iron Dome air and missile defense system to shield the U.S. homeland, which directly hearkens back to the Reagan-era Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). A renewed call to deploy space-based anti-missile interceptors is a central aspect of the plan as it has been presented now, which focuses primarily on defending against ballistic and other higher-end missile threats. In addition, any explicit mention of the ever-growing danger posed by drones is conspicuously absent. Trump had talked about the Iron Dome plan, which is also part of the current official Republican Party platform, on the campaign trail, and TWZ explored what was known about it in detail last year. The President has now provided new, more specific information in an Executive Order, a copy of which was posted online late last night. Trump says he's signing an executive order to have the Defense Department start constructing an Iron Dome defense system for the US pic.twitter.com/vsJSvDXFDF&mdash; Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) January 27, 2025 It is important to note up front that the Executive Order confirms that the new U.S. Iron Dome system is unrelated to the Israeli Iron Dome system, despite the shared name and Trump's off-handed references to the latter when talking about the former. The Iron Dome system from Israel's Rafael, as seen in the video below, is designed primarily to defend against lower-end and localized threats like artillery rockets and mortar shells. It does now also have some capability against drones and cruise missiles. 'The threat of attack by ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles, and other advanced aerial attacks, remains the most catastrophic threat facing the United States,' the Executive Order declares. 'Over the past 40 years, rather than lessening, the threat from next-generation strategic weapons has become more intense and complex with the development by peer and near-peer adversaries of next-generation delivery systems and their own homeland integrated air and missile defense capabilities.' 'He's what we need, to immediately begin the construction of a state-of-the-art Iron Dome missile defense shield, which will be able to protect Americans,' Trump also said at an event yesterday. The meat of the Executive Order is a call for a 'next-generation missile defense shield' that 'shall include, at a minimum, plans for' the following eight components: Defense of the United States against ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks from peer, near-peer, and rogue adversaries Acceleration of the deployment of the Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor layer Development and deployment of proliferated space-based interceptors capable of boost-phase intercept Deployment of underlayer and terminal-phase intercept capabilities postured to defeat a countervalue attack Development and deployment of a custody layer of the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture Development and deployment of capabilities to defeat missile attacks prior to launch and in the boost phase Development and deployment of a secure supply chain for all components with next-generation security and resilience features Development and deployment of non-kinetic capabilities to augment the kinetic defeat of ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks The Executive Order gives Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth just 60 days to present a path forward to implementing all of this and potentially more. The Office of Management and Budget is also tasked with formulating a cost estimate that will inform the upcoming proposed defense budget for the 2026 Fiscal Year. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth walks with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Air Force Gen. CQ Brown, Jr. after arriving at the Pentagon on January 27, 2025. DOD Petty Officer 1st Class Alexander Kubitza Addition provisions in the order require U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM) and U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) to jointly produce 'an updated assessment of the strategic missile threat to the Homeland' and 'a prioritized set of locations to progressively defend against a countervalue attack by nuclear adversaries.' Calls for bolstering regional air and missile defense capabilities, and to work with allies and partners to that end, are also included. The term countervalue is typically used in the context of planning for the employment of nuclear weapons, or responses to their use. It refers to the targeting of key military and other assets critical to a country's ability to wage war. It is also worth pointing out here that larger ballistic missiles and their payloads, in general, typically reach hypersonic speeds in the latter stages of their flight. The hypersonic threats mentioned here refer to advanced designs with added emphasis on very high maneuverability and largely flat atmospheric trajectories that make them especially hard to track and defend against. A graphic showing, in a very rudimentary way, the difference in trajectories between a traditional ballistic missile and an unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicle, a type of highly maneuverable hypersonic weapon. Pseudo or aeroballistic missiles and air-breathing hypersonic cruise missiles are also depicted. GAO The U.S. military's current dedicated homeland missile defense posture is focused primarily on shielding against limited strikes involving higher-end ballistic threats, and now increasingly novel hypersonic ones, primarily through a relatively small number of land-based interceptors tied to larger sensor and communications networks. Outside of the National Capital Region (NCR) around Washington, D.C., more general air defense duties, including protecting against incoming cruise missiles, falls almost exclusively to the U.S. Air Force (including the Air National Guard). Ground-based surface-to-air missiles (SAM) are deployed within the NCR, but the United States has not had a nation-wide SAM network since the 1970s. A graphic offering a very general look at the fields of coverage offered by the current elements of the US military’s missile defense architecture inside the United States and forward-deployed elsewhere around the world. US Army Some of what the Iron Dome Executive Order lays now out, including the named Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor (HBTSS) and Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA), is already in the works. HBTSS' central goal is the deployment of a new satellite constellation capable of not just providing improved early warning and situation awareness, but also fire control-quality tracks, including against highly maneuverable hypersonic threats. Two demonstrator HBTSS satellites are already in orbit. PWSA is working toward a multi-layered, distributed space-based networking backbone to support air and missile defense and other missions. The U.S. military has also been working on new 'underlayer and terminal-phase intercept capabilities,' including the Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI) for use against maneuvering hypersonic weapons. Efforts to develop options to neutralize ballistic and other missile threats at the point of launch, or even before they are launched (sometimes referred to as 'left of launch'), from any domain, are not new, either. The video below depicts a notional intercept involving various current and future missile defense capabilities, including GPI and HBTSS. The new call for space-based interceptors is notable, especially amid concerns about the broader weaponization of space already. At the same time, orbital missile defense capabilities, including physical interceptors and directed energy weapons, were areas of particularly active interest in President Trump's first term. There were also calls to field new and improved counter-space capabilities, including space-based kinetic weapons, under President Joe Biden. One of former Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall's last acts was to publish a report outlining a vision for future U.S. air and space capabilities by 2050 that explicitly mentions 'counterspace systems [that] will include a cost-effective mix of weapons, both terrestrial and on orbit.' As already noted, the Iron Dome Executive Order draws a direct comparison to Ronald Reagan's SDI, which was also envisioned as an array of ground and space-based anti-missile capabilities paired with new sensors and communications networks. 'President Ronald Reagan endeavored to build an effective defense against nuclear attacks, and while this program resulted in many technological advances, it was canceled before its goal could be realized,' the new order says. However, highlighting SDI also raises immediate questions about the viability of the new Iron Dome plan. SDI was infamously nicknamed 'Star Wars' by its critics and never came close to meeting its ambitious goals. President Bill Clinton finally brought it to a close for good in 1993 after some $30 billion – close to $56.1 billion in today's dollars – had been spent. U.S. missile defense efforts subsequently coalesced around more limited objectives, which ultimately led to the creation of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA). An artist’s conception of a space-based particle beam missile defense system from the Star Wars era. Los Alamos National Laboratory via Aerospace Projects Review The same kinds of criticisms leveled against SDI, including fears of prompting new arms races, especially in space, and the significant technical and other challenges in implementing the desired capabilities, are likely to come up again with Trump's Iron Dome plan. There will also be new cost concerns given that U.S. defense budgets are already facing increasing difficulties balancing competing priorities, especially around expensive nuclear modernization efforts. In addition, since the U.S. government withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002, something the new Executive Order also explicitly mentions, Russia and China, especially, have already been investing in new capabilities specifically designed to defeat or at least challenge American missile defense capabilities. China is also significantly expanding its nuclear stockpile, a trend that could continue there and emerge elsewhere, in response to the Iron Dome plan. Missile defense advocates have argued, in turn, that these realities put the United States at a dangerous disadvantage that requires additional protective measures. There is also a question of prioritization, which brings us to the matter of uncrewed aerial threats. At best, the Iron Dome plan lumps drones into the category of threats capable of executing 'other next-generation aerial attacks,' but that would de-emphasize the serious dangers posed now by even lower-end weaponized commercial designs. Alarms bells about the adequacy of domestic U.S. air defense capabilities, or the lack thereof, against less advanced threats like drones and cruise missiles have increasingly ringing in recent years. The line between drones, especially longer-range kamikaze types, and traditional cruise missiles is becoming increasingly blurry, too.

Reader Submission TWZ has for years now been highlighting drone threats, which are already on the cusp of becoming newly significant thanks to artificial intelligence and machine learning-driven technological developments that are also increasingly proliferating. As we wrote when talking about Trump's Iron Dome ambitions as they were known last summer: 'Drones, even lower-end weaponized commercial types, present an ever-growing threat in their own right, something that the war in Ukraine has helped finally push into the mainstream consciousness. The barrier to entry in this domain is extremely low, with terrorists, criminal groups, and other non-state actors – like the [Iranian-backed] Houthis [in Yemen] – increasingly using uncrewed aerial systems to launch attacks, as well as to conduct surveillance. Even relatively cheap examples of these systems can fly over extreme distances and strike with pinpoint accuracy. Their low and slow characteristics, and the fact that launch points can come from so far away, make them very hard to defend against. This poses a whole new threat dimension to the U.S., one in which the homeland is clearly vulnerable.' 'Looking outward for drone threats from America’s borders only factors in one facet of the issue. Attacks present the additional danger of being something that small groups or even individuals within the United States, can readily mount. The complexity of these potential attacks will only increase as the hardware and software to execute them proliferates even in the commercial space.' 'Reports of concerning drone activity over military bases and training ranges, as well as other sensitive sites, inside the United States, are only becoming more commonplace. U.S. authorities have said that many sightings of what are now commonly called unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), previously referred to as unidentified flying objects (UFO), have been assessed to have been uncrewed aircraft, as well as balloons, on closer examination, as well. It’s worth noting here that the U.S. military and other armed forces around the world, especially China, have been actively working to develop and field high-altitude balloons as penetrating launch platforms for drones and munitions, among other missions.' Still-unexplained drone incursions over Langley Air Force base in Virginia in December 2023, which TWZ was first to report, helped turn the issue into a national cause celebre last year. A flurry of reported drone sightings in the skies over New Jersey late last year, which we were also first to report on and evolved into something of a nationwide hysteria, both underscored and obscured the very real national security concerns at play. Drone incursions around bases hosting U.S. forces in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe have made clear this is a global issue. Jacek Boczarski/Anadolu via Getty Images The Pentagon did notably roll out a new counter-drone strategy in 2024. At the same time, U.S. military officials highlighted significant policy and other challenges still limiting their ability to respond to uncrewed aerial threats domestically last year. It is possible that the new Trump administration may seek to address the drone threat through other actions. Trump has already pushed for officials to loosen restrictions on using force against uncrewed aerial systems along the southern border through a separate Executive Order. Though we now have more specific details, there is much still to learn about Trump's new Iron Dome plan, and how and when it might implemented, in general.

What Red Sea Battles Have Taught The Navy About A Future China Fi...	The Navy’s surface fleet has spent the past 15 months taking down hundreds of missiles and drones fired by Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels at U.S. and allied Navies’ ships, as well as commercial vessels in and around the Red Sea. While it has become the most intense sustained combat the sea service’s warships have seen since World War II, the Navy continues to prioritize preparing for a conflict in the Pacific. This begs the question: What lessons does the Red Sea fight offer the Navy when it comes to preparing for conflict with its top pacing threat, China? TWZ reached out to a range active-duty and retired military officers to answer this question. They said the Red Sea was a prime stress test for a fleet preparing for war with China, even as it drained finite munitions and further exposed shortfalls in the defense industrial base. 'A lot of these lessons and everything that we are taking from the Red Sea are an incredibly valuable warm-up for us in the high-end fight,' an active-duty surface warfare officer (SWO) who spoke with TWZ on the condition of anonymity said. The Navy destroyer USS Donald Cook (DDG-75) launches a SM-2 missile during an exercise in 2020. (U.S. Navy) Analysts acknowledged the obvious — that China would be an entirely different adversary to take on compared to the Houthis, and that war with Beijing would be far more fearsome and intense than the Houthi campaign. But while the theater, geography and capability of the adversary would differ, the Red Sea has nonetheless been a major experience generator and proving ground on several fronts. Even without the China preparation angle, the Navy has earned some undeniable wins in the Red Sea. No American warships have been hit, and crews have countered Houthi attacks that have, at times, come dangerously close to putting a hole in a gray hull. Navy brass say they are now able to tune ship radars, provide feedback and update tactics far more rapidly now than when the hostilities started. Just analyzing engagement data has gone from 40 days or more to just a day or two, a massive gain that could prove critical in a Pacific fight. A year ago, TWZ detailed how the potential implications of this unprecedented amount of real-world experience and its resulting data flowing out of so many engagements, and how lessons learned from it could be used to the advantage of not only the U.S. Navy, but China as well. The destroyer USS Gravely (DDG-107) launches Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAM) in the Red Sea in January 2024. (U.S. Navy) Despite the Red Sea success so far, the surface fleet must remain humble, according to a retired warship captain who spoke to TWZ on condition of anonymity to share his thoughts. 'I think it is important that we not be lulled into a sense of complacency by our own success,' he said. 'We are fighting a high-end fight against a low-end adversary. The weapons, tactics, and strategic implications of a Pacific war could be quite different and more challenging.' The lessons the Navy has learned for fighting in a littoral environment like the Red Sea would be applicable to potential littoral conflict in the South China Sea or Luzon Strait, weapons engagement zones that would be far more saturated than an open ocean war. But even within a blue water fight over the expanses of the Pacific, key lessons apply, the active-duty SWO said. 'When you are in the littorals, your timelines are shorter' for tracking and intercepting incoming fire, he said. 'If you can execute on a littoral timeline, then you can execute on a blue water timeline.' Working through environmental frictions and the fog of war in the Red Sea is also a good dry run ahead of conflict with China, he said. 'The geography, the way the Houthis have evolved, is giving us some great insight, and it directly translates into us getting ready for that high-end fight against China,' the active-duty SWO said. And while Beijing may employ more advanced drones, anti-ship missiles and other ordnance, and in different ways, the Red Sea experience in taking out those threats still carries over, the active-duty SWO said. 'A missile, no matter what the origin is, is still going to be targeted,' he said. 'It’s still going to be targeting you, and a lot of those kinetic aspects still transfer over to even a higher-end type of missile.' While the Red Sea has been a closed-in, littoral fight, drones would still be seen in a blue-water war with China, the active-duty SWO said, noting Chinese amphibious ships that are being built to carry and launch advanced unmanned systems. TWZ reported last fall on China’s Type 076 amphib and its electromagnetic catapult for launching drones. Smaller drones don’t even need this infrastructure and can be launched in large numbers from nearly any vessel. China's Type 076 amphibious assault ship. (Chinese Internet capture via X) The math of wartime missile expenditure is another prime Red Sea takeaway that is applicable to a China war, according to Jan van Tol, a retired forward-deployed warship captain and current senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments think tank. Expensive surface-to-air (SAM) missiles that take a long time to procure and build have regularly been used to shoot down relatively cheap Houthi aerial attack drones, he said. Go here to read TWZ’s reporting about precisely which Navy munitions have been fired in the Red Sea, and how many times. But expenditure rates of guided munitions will be 'far worse in a China fight,' van Tol said. Exacerbating that reality is the fact that the PLA’s weapons are more sophisticated than the Iranian-derived munitions on which the Houthis rely, which will likely increase the number of American SAMs expended per engagement with the Chinese. China has far more anti-ship missiles than the Houthis, in a variety of iterations. It has developed short, medium, and intermediate-range anti-ship ballistic missiles to help exert authority over its broad territorial claims and deny opponents access to vast areas during conflicts. If Beijing attempts to invade Taiwan, it will rely on a variety of munitions to keep U.S. surface combatants and aircraft carriers far from the East China Sea and South China Sea. This is all part of the PLA’s overreaching anti-access/area-denial strategy that is currently heavily dictating what a war would look like in the Pacific. A very general look at some of the breadth of conventionally-armed long-range missile options China has, and the ranges they can reach. (DOD) 'PLA raid density will be far higher than the relative dribbles of Houthi attacks, so Navy ships will quickly run out of SAMs,' van Told said, adding that some U.S. Vertical Launching System (VLS) missile cells are loaded with non-SAM weapons, and that U.S. warships will have to retire to rearming locations far from the fight. The Navy is trying to mitigate having ships leave the battle for days or even weeks at a time for reloading via an at-sea VLS reloading capability known as the Transferrable Reloading At-sea Method (TRAM) that was demonstrated for the first time last fall. Go here to read TWZ coverage of that effort. Sailors aboard the Navy cruiser USS Chosin (CG-65) use the Transferrable Reload At-sea Method (TRAM) to grasp a missile canister over the ship's MK 41 Vertical Launching System (VLS) in October. (U.S. Navy) In a high-intensity war with China, SAMs and other weapons would be exhausted quickly, and the American defense industrial base 'has relatively little surge production capacity relative to need,' van Tol said. The Red Sea has hammered home the need to increase production of Navy munitions, van Tol said. A peacetime effort to increase precision-guided munition production of all kinds would help to identify component subcontractor chokepoints and other hiccups that would metastasize into a major problem when a surge in demand happens during a war with China. Military leaders have warned of how missiles fired in the Red Sea and elsewhere are eating into stocks that could be used for a war with China too. 'It would be important to identify those and make [defense industrial base] investments to ease those chokepoints,' he said. 'This was analogous to the difficult production problems the U.S. initially faced in 1939-1941 during the pre-Pearl Harbor industrial mobilization, which really was spurred by huge French and British demands for arms starting in the late 1930s … If it wasn’t for the ‘head start’ working out the problems while supplying those allies, the vast production of 1943-1944 would have never been possible.' While concerns about supply remain, the Red Sea is offering invaluable, real-world proof that a Navy warships’ air defense weapons actually work in combat, according to the active-duty SWO. 'We’re going to be facing an even higher-end fight against China,' he said. 'Confidence in the system is extremely important for us, for those sailors and operators and Marines and others that are going to be pushing out forward for that fight … whether it is a five-inch round, or whatever ordnance, a missile coming off a rail from an aircraft.' Military history is full of examples of weapon systems that appeared to be good to go, only to fail in the heat of battle, Mark Cancian, a retired Marine Corps colonel and senior advisor with the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, told TWZ. He pointed to the Navy’s defective Mk 14 torpedoes during World War II as a prime example. A Mk 14 torpedo is balanced during World War II. (U.S. Navy) 'Real world operations always enhance warfighting readiness because nothing is simulated,' he noted. 'Everything must be done, and there is a concrete result in the end. Even the best training doesn’t replicate these conditions.' The Navy would also face a multi-domain attack from China. Unlike the Houthis, who have largely launched airborne weapons and sometimes surface drones at warships, the PLA would come at the service in the undersea, space and cyber domains as well, van Tol said. 'Ships will not have the ‘luxury’ of concentrating on only one domain,' he said. While short on specifics, the active-duty SWO noted that the Navy’s electronic warfare (EW) capabilities have also benefited from real-world experience in the Red Sea. 'The exploitation of the RF spectrum to try and stay to the left of kinetic engagements is always something that we would like to take advantage of,' he said. 'Electrons are free, and I can read and I can produce those as long as I’m making electricity … there’s a lot of lessons learned on that aspect that we were able to put forth, from a detection to an engagement, in that whole kill chain aspect.' While the Red Sea campaign doesn’t come close to matching the intensity of operations should a war with China break out, it nonetheless provides the Navy with invaluable real-world insight into how systems work and what planning, training and procedures need to be tightened up, according to Bradley Martin, a retired surface warfare officer (SWO) who spent two-thirds of his 30-year Navy career at sea. Among the lessons the Navy can take out of the Red Sea are the stark realities of cyclic carrier air wing operations near an enemy’s weapons engagement zone, said Martin, now a senior policy analyst with the RAND think tank. The perils of such operations came into focus last month, when the cruiser USS Gettysburg (CG-64) accidentally shot down a F/A-18 Super Hornet during a sustained Houthi attack on the USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75). The Navy has released few details on the encounter, but at least three investigations are underway to determine what transpired. Flight operations aboard the USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75) in December. (U.S. Navy) 'Dealing with attacks from an enemy with a substantial shore-based arsenal is an important experience' as well, Martin added. The Houthi arsenal is provided via Iran, and past TWZ reporting revealed that the Navy has taken out more than 400 of the group’s anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCM), anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBM) and aerial attack drones since October 2023. Some of the arsenal fielded by the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. (IISS) ©2023, The International Institute for Strategic Studies, originally published on (reproduced with permission) But while the Red Sea is providing the Navy with valuable lessons, 'readiness is without question being drained,' Martin said. The U.S. Navy’s part in defending Israel from Iranian and Houthi ballistic missile attacks, and the tying in with Israeli defense infrastructure to accomplish that, has direct relevance to Taiwan’s defense in a future fight as well, the active-duty SWO said. Culturally, the Red Sea fight is nudging the surface fleet out of its 'peacetime' footing and giving it a taste of what war with China would entail, van Tol said. With the exception of Navy SEALs and some aviators, the fleet has not faced a serious threat of being attacked for decades, which has inhibited 'tough, realistic training.' A 'safety first' culture is fine and necessary for a peacetime Navy, but it is not helpful for preparing in earnest for a real conflict, he said. 'This has now seemingly changed to some extent … when ships deploy to the Red Sea, the crews know that they may come under attack,' van Tol said. 'The real chance of having to no-kidding defend the ship helps concentrate the mind wonderfully. This change in mindset and mentality is really important and seems to be happening.' Sailors stand watch in the combat information center of the Navy destroyer USS Carney (DDG-64) in October 2023. (U.S. Navy) The Red Sea has further reinforced the importance of maintaining a high level of tactical training and proficiency among a ship’s watch teams during war, he added. Such training can’t be limited to pre-deployment work-ups, because a war with China will come with relatively little notice. 'Ditto with regard to damage control training and material readiness,' van Tol said. 'The ships that have operated in the Red Sea to date have done a great job defensively so far, no hits. But even the Houthis may get lucky on an attack. Against the PLA’s much more potent threats, the odds of ships being hit would be far higher.' The current conflict is teaching the surface fleet vital lessons for the next war when it comes to crew stress under the threat of constant engagement, while instilling in sailors that all the training that they do really matters in the real world, according to the active-duty SWO. The surface fleet has increased how it monitors sailor wellbeing and ensures that those who need help get it as soon as possible as a result, he said. 'That’s an important aspect that we can’t just gloss over,' he said. 'That is the sailor's investment in the combat situation. We’ve seen a lot of initiatives pay off, and we’re getting better data on that.' The Red Sea has also helped to demystify certain munitions fired by the Houthis – variants of which China would use in a future fight – and proved that a U.S. warship can defeat them, according to James Holmes, a maritime strategy professor at the Naval War College. The Houthis are the first entity to ever fire an anti-ship ballistic missile in anger, and the Navy has now shown that such weapons can be taken out. 'The same goes for ‘kamikaze drones,’ which essentially serve the same purpose, as ship killers,' Holmes told TWZ in an email. 'Demystifying the next big and bad thing is a major contribution. We should not be cowed.' A Boatswain's Mate walks the flight deck as an MH-60S Sea Hawk helicopter takes off from the Navy destroyer USS Gravely (DDG-107) in March during the warship's deployment to the Red Sea. (U.S. Navy) Petty Officer 1st Class Jonathan Word At the same time, the Navy shouldn’t 'get cocky' about its performance in the Red Sea, he said. 'Carl von Clausewitz, probably the best strategic thinker of them all, implies that success in warfare is about a 60-40 proposition at best,' Holmes said. 'We can lose, and in fact I think the odds are in China’s favor. When a fraction of one force faces off against the entirety of another, who wins? We are the fraction, China’s PLA has the entirety. That is not the case in the Red Sea.' Still, he said, the Red Sea has provided the surface fleet a taste of what they might meet should war erupt with China. 'We are expending munitions we sorely need, so there is a material dimension to correct,' Holmes said. 'But at the same time, warfare is a human contest. We are getting our people ready to do what they may have to do before long. If we give them the tools, the tool wielders can do the work.' The Navy’s preparations for a potential battle against Chinese forces is accelerating, and the sea service has undoubtedly benefited from taking on a real-life adversary, even one far weaker than the People's Liberation Army. The at-times daily Red Sea conflict may be drawing to a close, with the Houthis announcing they would halt such attacks following a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. However it ends, the surface fleet has seen sustained combat for the first time in decades and shaken off the peacetime cobwebs in the process, a process that has provided great experience, a tsunami of data, and a sobering look at how prepared the surface fleet is to face-down a far more powerful foe.

Boom! The XB-1 Demonstrator Jet Has Gone Supersonic	Boom Supersonic’s XB-1 demonstrator has broken the sound barrier, marking a major milestone in the effort that hopes to lead to a larger 55-seat supersonic airliner design known as Overture. Overall, the program could have significant implications not only for commercial aviation but also for the military. Boom Supersonic’s XB-1 demonstrator eases past the sound barrier for the first time, going supersonic just over 11 minutes into its sortie today. YouTube screencap The aircraft was flown to a speed of Mach 1.1 by former U.S. Navy aviator and Boom test pilot Tristan 'Geppetto' Brandenburg, from the Mojave Air & Space Port, California. For the majority of its flight, the XB-1 was accompanied by two other supersonic jets, an ATAC Mirage F1 flown by A.J. 'Face' McFarland, serving as primary safety chase, and a T-38 Talon performing photo chase duties. During the flight, the XB-1 entered the supersonic realm three times, landing safely at Mojave after a flight of a little over 30 minutes duration.

The XB-1, also known as the 'Baby Boom,' is a one-third-scale technology demonstrator for the Overture. It made its first flight at Mojave on March 22, 2024, as you can read about here. During that flight, the XB-1 was flown at speeds up to 238 knots (273 mph, or Mach 0.355), achieving an altitude of 7,120 feet. On that occasion, Chief Test Pilot Bill 'Doc' Shoemaker was at the controls, while the flight was monitored by 'Geppetto' Brandenburg, flying a T-38 Talon chase aircraft. A video showing the first flight of the XB-1, on March 22, 2024: Boom Supersonic rolled out the XB-1, which carries the U.S. civil registration code N990XB, on October 7, 2020. The company first said it was developing this demonstrator in November 2016, some eight months after announcing its plans for the Overture. While we have outlined the key aspects of the XB-1 in the past, the aircraft is 62.6 feet long and its elongated delta-wing planform has a wingspan of 21 feet. It makes extensive use of sophisticated technologies, including carbon-fiber composites, advanced avionics, and digitally optimized aerodynamics. The XB-1 during an earlier test flight. Boom Supersonic It also has an unusual propulsion system to propel it into the supersonic regime. This comprises three General Electric J85-15 turbojets, which together provide more than 12,000 pounds of thrust. The widely used J85 also powers, among others, the Northrop F-5 and the T-38. Since the XB-1 was rolled out, another three-engined aircraft has broken cover, the Chinese advanced tailless combat aircraft tentatively known as the J-36. Compared to the XB-1, the Overture will be 201 feet long and is planned to achieve a cruising speed of Mach 1.7 (1,304 miles per hour) and a maximum speed of Mach 2.2. The company anticipates it will have a maximum range of 4,500 nautical miles. A rendering of Boom Supersonic’s Overture airliner. Boom Supersonic Achieving the Mach 1 mark is a huge achievement for the company and an important statement of intent for the future Overture supersonic airliner. Aimed to make supersonic travel more affordable to greater numbers of travelers — a goal in which no other operator has succeeded in the past — the Overture is planned to carry a total of 64-80 passengers. Intended to drastically shorten the duration of transoceanic routes, the aircraft is 'designed… to be profitable for airlines at fares similar to first and business class,' the company’s website notes. The last time this kind of performance was available to paying passengers, was aboard the Anglo-French Concorde. A seat on this iconic airliner cost multiple times that of an equivalent business-class fare and it was retired from commercial supersonic flight in late 2003.

However, it completed only around 100 commercial flights, only around half of them carrying passengers, before being relatively quickly relegated to cargo-carrying duties. It saw out its career as a supersonic research aircraft, including on behalf of NASA. A Soviet Tupolev Tu-144 supersonic airliner, at Schoenefeld Airport, East Germany.

It further states on its website that 'Overture’s order book stands at 130 orders and pre-orders,' with commitments from American Airlines, United Airlines, and Japan Airlines. Boom says it is slated to roll out the first Overture in 2026, with test flights to commence in 2027, and type certification expected by 2029. All this remains highly ambitious, with plenty more hurdles to negotiate, and we shouldn’t be surprised if that timeline fails to be met. Boom Supersonic Outside of the commercial market, potential military applications of the Overture shouldn’t be overlooked. Since 2020, Boom has been working with the U.S. Air Force with a view to a potential version of the Overture for high-speed executive flight. While moving government officials around at supersonic speed would be a unique and highly prestigious capability, the Overture design also offers potential for the rapid transit of cargo, as well as personnel, capabilities the Air Force has also been eyeing. In July 2022, Northrop Grumman and Boom announced a collaboration to develop a variant of the Overture specifically for the U.S. and allied military forces. At the time, Boom noted that a military variant would be ideal for 'rapid-response missions.' A pilot’s eye view of XB-1’s tenth test flight, narrated by Chief Flight Test Engineer Nick Sheryka: 'Fitted with specialized capabilities, the aircraft could be used to deliver medical supplies, provide for emergency medical evacuation, or surveil vast areas faster than conventional aircraft,' the company said. 'The special mission Overture variant could also be used to coordinate other aircraft and ground assets in a variety of scenarios.' Since then, there have been more efforts to progress the development of 'defense variants' of the Overture. In September 2023, Boom announced the launch of its Defense Advisory Group, building on its collaboration with Northrop Grumman. The group aims to help identify unspecified 'national security missions' the aircraft could be used for.

TOLGA AKMEN/AFP via Getty Images TOLGA AKMEN But like the commercial applications of the Overture, the prospect of getting a militarized version off the ground is also fraught with difficulties. Back in 2017, Lockheed Martin announced that it was working with Aerion to develop the AS2 supersonic business jet — a primarily commercial aircraft that could have military applications. At the time, we outlined the various ways in which its capabilities could be harnessed by the U.S. military, only for Aerion to go out of business in 2021. A rendering of the Aerion AS2 in a U.S. military livery. Aerion Ultimately, despite the undoubted military potential of the Overture — or developments of it — it will be the commercial marketplace where the program succeeds or fails. The history of prior programs demonstrates just how difficult it is to make commercial supersonic flight a reality, especially an affordable one. That, however, remains Boom’s primary aim. For now, however, it’s very much worth reflecting on Boom Supersonic’s achievement of breaking the sound barrier with its XB-1. Whatever the future has in store for this ambitious program, the exotic test jet is sure to capture imaginations like the supersonic pioneers that came before it.

Billions For Next Generation Fighter Jet Engines Greenlit By Air ...	The U.S. Air Force has dramatically plussed-up contracts with General Electric and Pratt & Whitney, both of which now have a ceiling of $3.5 billion, to continue work on prototype next-generation jet engines. To date, the Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion (NGAP) program has been focused primarily on developing new engines to power a new sixth-generation crewed stealth 'fighter' in the works as part of the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative. The NGAD combat jet's future is now an open question, but NGAP might also feed into other advanced aviation programs. The Pentagon announced the modifications to the existing NGAP deals in its daily contracting notice today. Both are described as funding additional 'technology maturation and risk reduction services' in support of work on prototype engines. A notional sixth-generation stealth combat jet. Collins Aerospace The specific entry for the modification to the NGAP contract with Pratt & Whitney (a subsidiary of Raytheon) provides the following additional context: 'The work includes design, analysis, rig testing, prototype engine build and testing, and weapon system integration. The contract modification is for the execution of the prototype phase of the Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion program and is focused on delivering a state-of-the-art propulsion system with a flexible architecture that can be tailored for future combat aircraft operating across various mission threads; and digitally transforming the propulsion industrial base.' An engine test rig at the U.S. Air Force's Arnold Engineering Development Complex (AEDC) in 2017 used to support work on Pratt &#038; Whitney's XA101 engine. The company is leveraging work on the XA101 for its NGAP design. USAF The U.S. Air Force first awarded the NGAP contracts to General Electric and Pratt & Whitney in 2022. At that time, additional NGAP contracts also went to Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman, the three prime contractors vying at that point to develop the NGAD combat jet, to help ensure the next-generation engines would be compatible with their respective designs. Each of those deals had an initial ceiling of close to $1 billion. Details about the NGAP designs from General Electric and Pratt & Whitney, known as the XA102 and XA103, respectively, remain limited. The XA102 passed a major design review in 2023 and the XA103 did the same last year. They both leverage work on earlier engines that the two companies developed as potential options for re-engining F-35 Joint Strike Fighters as part of the Air Force's Adaptive Engine Transition Program (AETP). In 2023, the Air Force announced its intention to cancel AETP in favor of upgrading the existing Pratt & Whitney F135 engine currently used on all variants of the F-35. Congress subsequently authorized additional funding for AETP. An old Air Force briefing slide, dating back to at least 2018, regarding the AETP effort. USAF An old Air Force briefing slide, dating back to at least 2018, that shows potential benefits that could be released through the AETP program and follow-on efforts for various aircraft types, including a future advanced combat jet. USAF Like the XA100 and XA101, the XA102 and XA103 are known to be so-called adaptive cycle designs. What this means in broad strokes is that their bypass ratios can be adjusted on demand while in flight between modes that are more fuel-efficient or provide more power, depending on what the situation requires. For instance, a tactical jet with such an engine could fly in an 'efficiency' mode to an operating area, helping to conserve fuel for when it gets on station, which might include time in a higher-power combat-focused mode. The capabilities adaptive cycle engines offer could be particularly important in a future large-scale conflict, especially one against China across the board expanses of the Pacific, where aerial refueling assets are expected to be increasingly at risk and available bases could be few and far between. General Electric has previously said that its earlier XA100 design is some 25 percent more efficient than the F135 and can also offer between 10 and 20 percent more thrust than the Pratt & Whitney engine in certain flight profiles. You can read more about the XA100 and adaptive cycle technologies here. Despite the new funding, what any future NGAP engine might power is less clear than it was back in 2022. The Air Force launched a deep review of its NGAD combat jet plans last year and it remains unclear how the service under the new Trump administration will proceed. A number of alternatives to the original concept, envisioned as a relatively large and expensive successor to the F-22 Raptor stealth fighter but with an overall different mission set, have been proposed, including a truncated lower-cost design viewed more as a follow-on to the F-35 with a focus on acting as an aerial drone controller. NGAP engines, or derivatives thereof, could still power the NGAD combat jet regardless of its final form. Members of a next-generation family of jet engines, or technologies therefrom, could find their way into other advanced Air Force crewed and uncrewed aircraft, as well. The service is actively working to acquire new Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones and is also eyeing stealthy aerial refueling tankers, though the future of those efforts has also been called into question primarily due to concerns about affordability. The Air Force's budget outlook is complicated by a number of very high-priority, but also very expensive programs, including the B-21 Raider stealth bomber and LGM-35A Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile. The ballooning cost of Sentinel was a key factor in the decision to initiate the NGAD combat jet review. Other branches of the U.S. military could be interested in the NGAP engines or related designs. While the future of the NGAD combat jet is murky, the U.S. Navy has insisted that it will push ahead with its own plans for a sixth-generation carrier-capable stealth 'fighter' commonly referred to now as F/A-XX. At the same time, in an interview with Aviation Week last year, the Navy did say it was looking to chart a course for F/A-XX independent of Air Force efforts, including NGAP. A rendering of notional U.S. Navy sixth-generation combat jets flying past an aircraft carrier. Boeing At the same time, any engines that might come out of NGAP still look to be a ways off. The contract modifications announced today for the ongoing prototyping effort now cover work through 2032. Whatever ultimately comes of NGAP, the expanded deals with General Electric and Pratt & Whitney show the Air Force is still very committed now to seeing the development of the XA102 and XA103 through to at least the prototype stage.

Rebel Troops Claim Capture Of Congo Border City Stoking Fears Of ...	The M23 rebel group, which has taken control of large parts of the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in recent years, now says it has captured the key city of Goma, the largest in the area, from government forces. While the DRC government earlier today disputed that the city had fallen to the rebels, there’s no doubt that M23 has made a rapid advance in the last days and tensions between the DRC and neighboring Rwanda — which backs M23 — are growing. Members of the M23 armed group alongside residents in a street of the Keshero neighborhood in Goma, on January 27, 2025. Photo by STR / AFP -STR In a statement today, M23 announced it had taken Goma, as the United Nations reported 'mass panic' in the city, with the DRC government describing the insurgency as a 'declaration of war.' 'We urge all residents of Goma to remain calm. The liberation of the city has been successfully carried out, and the situation is under control,' the M23 spokesperson, Lawrence Kanyuka, said on X.

They then called upon the DRC government soldiers — the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC) — to surrender their weapons. The deadline for this expired early Monday morning. According to U.N. peacekeepers, some DRC soldiers gave up their weapons before the deadline. #DRCongo : footage shows government forces surrendering with their weapons held above their heads as they cross the border from #Goma into neighboring #Rwanda. pic.twitter.com/ZclQ466u2n&mdash; Thomas van Linge (@ThomasVLinge) January 27, 2025 Map of the city of Goma in the east of the DRC showing the international airport, central prison, and the border post with Rwanda.

According to the United Nations, M23 now controls key roads in and out of the city and the airport can no longer be used for evacuation and humanitarian efforts. The U.N.’s special representative for Congo told an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council, 'We are trapped.' At the weekend, the U.N. had said it would withdraw all of its non-essential staff out of the city. Head of MONUSCO Bintou Keita tell UNSC:'Today, despite ongoing MONUSCO support to FARDC, M23 and Rwandan forces penetrated Munigi quarter in the outskirts Goma city, causing mass panic and flight amongst the population.

'Contrary to the manipulative messages circulating on social networks the FARDC hold the Goma airport… and all the strategic points of the capital of the North Kivu province,' the DRC government said. It added that its army was 'more than determined to defend the homeland at the cost of the supreme sacrifice.' There have been reports today of heavy artillery hitting central Goma, as well as a mass escape from a prison in the city that was holding 3,000 inmates. There are also reports of the power and water supplies having been cut in many areas.

I have not seen the M23 yet.' A local journalist told the BBC today that gunfire was continuing in Goma and the situation was 'complicated.' Meanwhile, the chaplain of a hospital in Goma told the BBC that while 'we still have quite a number of [FARDC] soldiers that have gathered together… a big part of the city is controlled by the rebels.' Tens of thousands of residents have reportedly already fled the city, which was home to more than a million people. This is a continuation of a broader trend in the DRC’s North and South Kivu provinces which border Rwanda. Since the start of the year, more than 400,000 people have been forced from their homes here, according to the U.N., as M23 rebels have continued their advance. Of those displaced, more than 178,000 people were forced to leave their homes in the past two weeks. On the FARDC side, the military governor of North Kivu province, Maj. Gen. Peter Cirimwami Nkuba was killed during fighting against M23 rebels, around eight miles from Goma. He was shot last Thursday, during a visit to the front lines, but his death was only announced today. The FARDC has been seen using rocket artillery and Soviet-era tanks to try and counter the rebel advance, as well as rocket-armed Mi-24 Hind helicopter gunships.

The eastern part of the DRC is rich in mineral resources, control of which has been fought over by various armed groups. As well as the DRC’s own authorities, rebel factions and neighboring countries have been dragged into the fighting. In the process, millions have been killed, with the most violent periods being two major conflicts in the 1990s. The M23 rebel group now in Goma dates back to 2012, when it was formed out of another faction, with the stated goal of protecting the ethnic Tutsi population in the east of the DRC. Most of the M23 fighters are Tutsis who formerly served with Congolese government forces. Although M23 has been forced out of the DRC once before, by 2021 they were ready to launch a new offensive. Both the DRC and the U.N. say that M23 is backed by Rwanda. For its part, Rwanda neither confirms nor denies its direct backing for M23, although it refutes claims that it has sent its own troops across the border to support the rebels. This is despite reports from the U.N. that, as of last year, as many as 4,000 Rwandan troops were in the DRC. Reports today citing unnamed intelligence officials suggest that significant numbers of soldiers from the Rwanda Defense Force have crossed the border to support M23, with their numbers and heavy weapons likely to have significantly helped speed the rebel advance. A pickup truck of the FARDC patrols in Goma, on January 23, 2025. Photo by Jospin Mwisha / AFP JOSPIN MWISHA U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres yesterday called on 'the Rwanda Defense Force to stop supporting the M23 and to withdraw from the territory of the DRC,' in a statement that clearly put at least some of the responsibility for the current violence on Rwanda. Adding to the weight of evidence that Rwandan soldiers are also supporting the M23 offensive was U.N. peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix, who said: 'There’s no question that there are Rwandan troops in Goma supporting the M23. Of course, it’s difficult to tell exactly what the numbers are.' The total number of M23 fighters is generally put at more than 8,000. The Rwandan government has said the latest fighting near its border poses a 'serious threat' to its 'security and territorial integrity.' It has also blamed the DRC for the escalating violence. Today, Rwanda blamed shelling by the DRC for killing five people and injuring 26 in the town of Rubavu, on the Rwandan side of the border. 'They are desperate, fleeing. They are mounting their weapons, indiscriminately shelling into Rwanda, not targeting forces but targeting civilians,' Rwanda’s military spokesperson told Reuters. The current conflict also involves around 14,000 U.N. peacekeepers — under the MONUSCO mission — who are primarily tasked with supporting the FARDC in their campaign against M23. MONUSCO troops had been planning to leave the DRC prior to the latest escalation. It is also worth noting that, despite their numbers, only a portion of the MONUSCO troops are allowed to carry out offensive operations — these are the soldiers assigned to the so-called Force Intervention Brigade.

Separate from MONUSCO is another military force deployed in the eastern DRC — the Southern African Development Community (SADC) — but they have also failed to stop the M23 advance. In recent days, the various peacekeeping forces have reported multiple casualties. South Africa said nine of its soldiers were killed while attempting to prevent the rebel advance on Goma.

The apparent fall of Goma is a significant development in the long-running conflict in the African Great Lakes Region. With the airport apparently shut down and roads blocked, the humanitarian and security hub that operated out of the city, serving much of the surrounding region, will also have to cease operations. Already, the region faces one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, with millions of people displaced. Now, the advance of the M23 rebels is further destabilizing the eastern DRC. As a new insurgency threatens to engulf this part of the country, the fear now is of a potential wider conflict involving both the DRC and Rwanda and potentially other countries in the region.

C-32 Forced To Delay Landing After F-16s Scrambled To Intercept D...	A C-32A VIP transport jet on a special air mission (SAM) had to delay landing at Joint Base Andrews on Saturday because two U.S. Air National Guard F-16C Vipers and a U.S. Coast Guard MH-65 helicopter were scrambled to intercept a 'potential drone' flying near the capital region, according to Air Traffic Control (ATC) audio posted online the internet. The object was observed over Freeway Airport located about 10 miles north of Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, according to that audio. The incident began around 8:30 p.m. Eastern time on Saturday. The C-32A was using callsign SAM47, which makes it clear neither POTUS nor VPOTUS were on board, although it was likely operating in support of the President's movements to the West Coast. 'You can expect some delay, I have a scramble in progress,' an ATC operator told the pilots of SAM47, according to the audio posted by a user named TEEJ on the metabunk.com website. Our friend @Thenewarea51 on X also posted a snippet of the conversation, along with flight tracking data that showed C-32A’s flight path. One of the POTUS backup aircraft SAM47 (C-32A) just happened to try and land at Andrews AFB in DC while returning from California when a potential drone was observed.

The ATC operator told the Coast Guard helicopter, callsign BLACKJACK01 and one of the F-16s, callsign BRAVE01, that the target of interest (TOI) was 'a potential drone [flying at an altitude of] between 5,000 and 6,000' feet. A second Viper, callsign BRAVE02, was also launched to track down the potential drone. 'BLACKJACK01, the TOI is now off about one to two o'clock, four miles south,' the ATC operator told the helicopter, guiding it toward the target. 'It looks like it is in the vicinity of Freeway Aiport,' a privately owned airport in Mitchellville, Maryland. Several minutes later, ATC asked if BLACKJACK01 had intercepted the TOI. 'Negative for BLACKJACK01, negative.' the helicopter responded before being given further guidance from ATC. 'BRAVE01, turn right heading 320 last known radar ping was northwest of your position at six miles,' ATC told the Viper’s pilot. 'BLACKJACK01, navigation is approved and just be advised I'm not showing a target anymore,' ATC told the helicopter a few minutes later. 'No more TOI.'

(113th Wing) Eventually, the F-16s returned to their station at Andrews AFB and the MH-65 returned to its base at Reagan International Airport without intercepting the target and the C-32A landed without further incident as well.

Doscher) A spokesperson for the 89th Airlift Wing at JBA, which is responsible for the presidential airlift unit and its mission, told The War Zone that there was no drone over the base and declined comment about the aircraft that were scrambled. We’ve also reached out to the Air Force, the 316th Wing at Andrews Air Force Base, the 113th Wing, the White House, the FAA, the Coast Guard, U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM), and Freeway Airport for more information about what happened and what response measures were taken. In addition, we contacted the FBI, which is already investigating a wave of drone sightings on the East Coast, to see if they are looking into this incident. The FAA deferred our questions to the Defense Department. The 316th Wing at Andrews Air Force Base deferred our questions to the 89th Airlift Wing. We will update this story with any pertinent information provided. It is unclear what would have happened if either the Vipers or the helicopter actually did intercept the potential drone. However, the incident underscores the challenges of protecting airspace near the capital from these objects and the limitations on counter-drone authorities and capabilities. An often confusing maelstrom of legal and regulatory hurdles that limit how and when active counter-drone defenses of any kind can be employed within the homeland, which you can read more about in our deep dive here. The airspace over the capital region is the nation’s most heavily protected. It is extremely well monitored with counter-drone and specialized optical systems, as well as enhanced radar, and FIM-92 Stinger missiles National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems, or NASAMS stand ready to shoot if need be, in addition to airborne intercept assets. Regardless, smaller, slower drones are very hard to spot even during the day, let alone at night, due to their size and signature, making them extremely hard to intercept. It can also be dangerous because they are so hard to see and fly at much lower speeds than the aircraft intercepting them, especially the Vipers, so midair collisions are a real risk. The MH-65 is on call specifically to intercept low-and-slow moving targets like small light aircraft and the suspected drone, in this case. It's also important to note that even with such an advanced and multi-layered integrated air defense system that cocoons the capital region, false alarms in regard to drones or intruding aircraft do occur. You can read all about one very prominent incident in which this happened and why in this TWZ exclusive. This latest incident took place after a mass wave of drone sightings, mostly over New Jersey and New York. That included sightings over power facilities, Picatinny Arsenal and Trump’s golf course in Bedminster that spurred the FAA to issue scores of Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs). Picatinny received a permanent drone ban over its facility while the other TFRs expired earlier this month without renewal except the one over Bedminster. The president, who had already promised to provide details about these incursions, last week ordered his chief of staff to share findings about those sightings with the public. The potential drone sighting near Andrews Air Force Base also comes after drone incursions in December 2023 over Langley Air Force Base in Virginia, about 130 miles to the south. That event appears to have sparked a major wakeup call within the DoD as to the threat posed by these craft to critical military infrastructure. Many other military installations in the Continental United States, like Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, have also been subjected to drones of unknown origin intruding over their airspace, as had the Air Force’s Plant 42 advanced aerospace development hub in California this past fall. There were also drone incursions over U.S. bases in the United Kingdom in November. The last of those took place on Nov. 26, a spokesperson for the 48th Fighter Wing at RAF Lakenheath told us. The War Zone was the first to report all those incidents. It is unknown at the moment if the incident that took place over the weekend has any connection to any of these prior sightings. However, it is likely to renew concerns about these objects, who is operating them, and whether they pose any real threats.

Russian Withdrawal From Prized Syrian Naval Base Now Underway	Satellite imagery shows clear indications that Russia's increasingly anticipated withdrawal of forces from its Tartus naval base in Syria has finally started. Complete loss of access to the facility, where Russian vehicles and materiel have been massing there for weeks already, would be a major blow to the Kremlin. The Russian military has already been steadily drawing down its posture at Khmeimim Air Base in Syria amid persistent questions about the future of its presence in the country as a whole since the sudden fall of dictator Bashar Al Assad last year. Satellite imagery taken on January 25 that TWZ obtained from Maxar, seen at the top of this story and below, shows the Russian-flagged roll-on/roll-off (RO/RO) cargo ships Sparta and Sparta II docked in Tartus, as well as cargo transloading activity. The two ships had been holding offshore for days before finally being allowed to enter the port.

Satellite image ©2024 Maxar Technologies An additional satellite image taken on January 27 that TWZ reviewed from Planet Labs shows even more vehicles and materiel missing from the pier. A number of vehicles are also now visible arrayed in a row close to the pier edge, which would make them easier to load onto a ship. A large number of shipping containers have also now appeared in another nearby cargo marshaling area, though it is unclear whether or not this is related to the movement of Russian materiel or non-military cargo operations that have now resumed at the port.

The satellite image from Planet also confirms that one of these vessels has now departed, which would align with the aforementioned disappearance of the vehicles and materiel.

Similar aerial activity has been observed in the past around the withdrawal of forces from Khmeimim. The image from Planet also looks to show a Russian Grachonok class patrol boat, designed primarily for force protection duties in and around ports, moored in Tartus. #Russian Ka-52 & Mi-8 #helicopters spotted conducting reconnaissance over #Syria's Tartus port, where Russian logistics vessels Sparta & Sparta II are docked.

Notably, only the Sparta's, no warships as far as I know, have been alongside so far. pic.twitter.com/nGaxBloRps&mdash; Thord Are Iversen (@The_Lookout_N) January 27, 2025 TWZ has previously highlighted the significant vulnerability of Russian maritime and ground assets at both Tartus and Khmeimim, especially to drones, as emplaced air and other defenses appear to have been broken down for withdrawal. Russian naval vessels that were in the port of Tartus when Assad fell left shortly thereafter in another apparent force protection move. Many of them still appear to be holding off the coast, though the Improved Kilo class submarine Novorossiysk has notably left the region. Another Russian RO/RO cargo ship, the Sparta IV, was recently observed leaving the Baltic Sea along with a Russian Navy Ropucha class amphibious warfare ship. These vessels may also be headed for Syria, but this currently remains unconfirmed. Other Russian amphibious warfare ships that could be used to transport cargo out of Tartus have also arrived off the coast of that port in recent weeks. Another Russian-flagged cargo ship, the Ursa Major, which may have been Syria-bound, sank in the Mediterranean in December 2024 under still-murky circumstances as you can read more about here.

The Kremlin had struck the deal back in 2017 with the Assad regime, which had essentially gifted the naval facility, as well as Khmeimim Air Base, to the Russians. Two years earlier, Russia's military launched an invention in the country some two years earlier, which had saved Assad from advancing rebel forces. Russian forces were still actively fighting rebel forces, including elements of the coalition led by Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) that ultimately deposed Assad, right up until the collapse of the regime. As TWZ highlighted even before the fall of Assad's regime in December 2024, Tartus and Khmeimim are strategically very significant for Russia beyond just operations in Syria and the Middle East. The facilities have been particularly important nodes for supporting Russian activity in Africa, especially Libya, where the Kremlin looks to be trying now to bolster its presence. Tartus notably provided the Russian Navy with a key warm water port. Khmeimim, which Russia has notably expanded in recent years, including to help the base be better able to serve larger aircraft like bombers, had also been a valuable point from which to project air power across the Mediterranean and elsewhere. What the final status of the naval base at Tartus and Khmeimim Air Base will look like remains unclear. Russia has, unsurprisingly, voiced clear interest in retaining at least some kind of presence at both facilities and has reportedly been negotiating with the new Syrian authorities in Damascus to this end. For its part, the post-Assad government, led by members of HTS, has previously expressed a willingness to maintain ties with the Kremlin despite open conflict between the two sides just two months ago.

Bakr ALKASEM / AFP via Getty Images BAKR ALKASEM The situation across Syria is otherwise still extremely fluid, and the new government in Damascus has yet to consolidate control over much of the country. Turkish-backed forces continue to openly fight with Kurdish groups, including elements tied to the U.S.-supported Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), in the north. There has also been talk of integrating the SDF into a new national military. In southwestern Syria, Israel looks to be consolidating its control over territory in an ostensible buffer zone, moves that have been criticized by the HTS-led government and parts of the international community. Israeli, U.S., and other foreign forces have also taken advantage of the newly permissive airspace across Syria to launch airstrikes in support of their national interests. The U.S. military says its focus is on preventing ISIS terrorists from exploiting the situation to regroup and has reportedly shared intelligence with HTS to support that fight. Still, many countries, including Russia and the United States, formally designate HTS as a terrorist group. Major U.S. and other foreign sanctions imposed on the Assad regime also remain in place, though American and European officials have moved to relax and/or suspend them. Whether or not Russia's military presence in Syria is now set to end entirely remains unknown, but after weeks of steady withdrawals from Khmeimim Air Base, the departure of forces from Tartus now looks to be actively underway.

China’s Mysterious Tailless Stealth Fighter Has Swiveling Wingtip...	A new photo of the still-mysterious Chinese tailless combat aircraft, likely from the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation, which first surfaced last month, provides a better view of the rear aspect of the jet. The image would appear to confirm that the aircraft’s outer wingtip sections act as moving control surfaces, as we had previously suggested was a high possibility. You can read our full extremely in-depth analysis on both of China's new stealthy tailless tactical jets here. The photo in question was first published on the Chinese microblogging website Weibo. The aircraft is seen on approach to land, passing over a busy highway in daylight. Since it first appeared, some observers have suggested the jet may be designated J-50 (in the Chinese Jianjiji or fighter series), while others have referred to it as the J-XDS. At this stage, we simply don’t know for sure. A new photo shows the Chinese tailless combat aircraft, likely from the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation, from the rear aspect. via X While it’s worth noting that the authenticity of the photo cannot be confirmed, there’s nothing to suggest that it’s been manipulated and it’s otherwise in line with the imagery of the aircraft that we have seen before. Via ACuriousPLAFan/SDF:'A rear view photo of J-XDS, posted by Cute Orca on Weibo with the caption 'If this is not a PS-ed photo, this shows that the J-XDS has full-moving wingtips and no angled vertical stabilizers.'' pic.twitter.com/W8UEmA2Twc&mdash; @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) January 27, 2025 Seen here from the rear aspect, there is no sign of the ‘pop-out’ maneuvering tail surfaces that some had suggested might be present and which had also appeared in ‘fan art’ of the same aircraft. The suggestion was that such surfaces might sit flush with the inner wing area, before being activated for low-speed flight, increasing control authority and maneuverability. As we explained in our analysis feature, this didn’t seem to be the case and this photo helps disprove this claim further — especially since the aircraft is seen in a low-speed phase of flight when such control surfaces would be deployed. A fan art render shows an imagined configuration with ‘pop-out’ maneuvering tails, something that we can now more or less rule out: Just wow! SAC J-50 rendering with foldable tails pic.twitter.com/iCHMZZ32Lz&mdash; Húrin (@Hurin92) January 1, 2025 As we pointed out in the past, having these auxiliary tail surfaces would add more weight and complexity to the design, and also decrease fuel storage, which would likely not be worth any advantages they would bring in terms of stability and agility. The apparent confirmation that the aircraft has swiveling outer wingtip sections, which serve as major control surfaces, is significant. In this photo, the tip of the right wing can be clearly seen in a front-up, rear-down position. Having extremely widely spaced surfaces that span from the leading edge to the trailing edge like this should provide a lot of roll authority and, when deployed together, should also be used to control pitch. In this way, the outer wing sections — combined with an advanced digital flight control system — would help mitigate the stability issues that come with a tailless design. An earlier rear-aspect view of the reported Shenyang combat aircraft design. From this angle, a prominent flight-test data probe can be seen on the nose. via X The disadvantage of this arrangement is a likely reduction in low observability, although the designers will have presumably decided that the compromise is worthwhile, especially if it is a requirement of the tailless configuration. This could be reduced in cruise to some degree by limiting the articulation of these surfaces, or even locking them out entirely unless a severe input is commanded. Still, just having a jointed area in this location is less than desirable in a similar manner to how canards are not conducive to extreme radar signature reduction goals. Aside from this, the new photo probably also provides us with our best look at what could be a cockpit canopy, which was not very discernible in previous images. While it’s again hard to determine any details, a prominent bulge does at least seem to be present where a cockpit should be. There has been some speculation that this aircraft could be uncrewed. This doesn’t seem to be the case by anything we are seeing, but it’s always possible as the bulge could also accommodate a satellite communications package. Once again, this is very unlikely at this time. An earlier view of the reported Shenyang design accompanied by a Flanker chase plane. The high/mid-set wing appears to be a modified ‘lambda’ design. via X The low resolution of the photo means it’s hard to determine much about the configuration of the fighter’s engine exhausts, although the suggestion, once again, is that the twin powerplants are provided with 2D thrust-vectoring nozzles very similar to those found on the U.S. F-22 Raptor. This would also help with stability and maneuverability. The thickness of the fuselage — another aspect we discussed in our deep-dive analysis piece — is also showcased in this new image. Another previous underside view of the aircraft provides a suggestion of the complex arrangement of control surfaces across the trailing edge of the wing, as well as the movable wingtips. via X As well as contributing to low observability, engine nozzles of this kind would enhance the aircraft’s maneuverability and stability, key concerns considering that it’s a relatively heavy, tailless design. Overall, there remain many unknowns about this, the second Chinese tailless combat aircraft to break cover last December 26. However, more photos are sure to emerge and these should gradually provide us with a much better idea about its design, as well as provide a hint toward its potential capabilities and anticipated role.

Bunker Talk: Let’s Talk About All The Things We Did And Didn’t Co...	Welcome to Bunker Talk. This is a weekend open discussion post for the best commenting crew on the net, in which we can chat about all the stuff that went on this week that we didn’t cover. We can also talk about the stuff we did or whatever else grabs your interest. In other words, it’s an off-topic thread. The caption to this week’s top shot reads: NANTWICH, ENGLAND - MAY 24: The ballistic missile early warning control centre inside the former RAF Hack Green secret nuclear bunker on May 24, 2023 in Nantwich, England. Hack Green played a central role in the defence of Britain for almost sixty years. It was chosen during WW2 to protect the land between Birmingham and Liverpool from hostile attack and as a location for the new RADAR equipment. The bunker went on to be used for shelter and protection during the Cold War. As relations between East and West thawed many of the UK's nuclear bunkers were sold off. The Secret Bunker is now privately owned by the Siebert family and is run as a museum trust. Also, a reminder: Prime Directives! If you want to talk politics, do so respectfully and know that there’s always somebody that isn’t going to agree with you. If you have political differences, hash it out respectfully, stick to the facts, and no childish name-calling or personal attacks of any kind. If you can’t handle yourself in that manner, then please, discuss virtually anything else. No drive-by garbage political memes. No conspiracy theory rants. Links to crackpot sites will be axed, too. Trolling and shitposting will not be tolerated. No obsessive behavior about other users. Just don’t interact with folks you don’t like. Do not be a sucker and feed trolls! That’s as much on you as on them. Use the mute button if you don’t like what you see. So unless you have something of quality to say, know how to treat people with respect, understand that everyone isn’t going to subscribe to your exact same worldview, and have come to terms with the reality that there is no perfect solution when it comes to moderation of a community like this, it’s probably best to just move on. Finally, as always, report offenders, please. This doesn’t mean reporting people who don’t share your political views, but we really need your help in this regard. The Bunker is open!

Russians Enter Last Major Ukrainian Stronghold In Key Eastern Sec...	Russian forces have entered the Donetsk Oblast town of Velyka Novosilka, according to Russian and Ukrainian sources. The settlement is Ukraine’s last major stronghold in the southern Donbas region. Located at the intersection of Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Dnipropetrovsk Oblasts, its capture could provide Russian forces with a potential route for advancement into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Ukrainian military analysts say, according to Euromaidan Press. 'Military personnel of the ‘Vostok’ group continue to hack into the defense of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Velyka Novosilka,' the Russian MoD claimed on Telegram. 'Servicemen from the ‘East’ military group installed the Russian flag on one of the buildings recaptured from the enemy in the center of the settlement.' The Ukrainian DeepState open-source tracking group confirmed that assessment, saying 'The enemy is successful in advancing on the eastern outskirts, and has also occupied a small part of the central streets of the settlement, where they filmed their videos with rags.' Video emerged on social media appearing to back up that claim.

'Velyka Novosilka is the last large, well-prepared line of defense and logistics hub of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the South Donetsk direction,' the MoD stated. Though the Russians are in the middle of the settlement, fighting for its control still rages. A day earlier, a Ukrainian military official expressed concern that the settlement could be encircled. 'The Russians are conducting mixed assaults, using both infantry and equipment,' said Viktor Tregubov, a representative of the Ukrainian Khortysya operational-strategic group, according to Radio Liberty. 'There are actually a lot of problems there. Velyka Novosilka is now in a rather difficult situation.' The situation is 'dynamic, difficult,' he added, because 'the Russians have a large quantitative advantage, in particular, in personnel.' Russian soldiers raise the flag in Velyka Novosilka pic.twitter.com/skcSboMMjX&mdash; LogKa (@LogKa11) January 24, 2025 Making matters worse, the geographical layout of the area, including a river that cuts through the village, complicates defensive maneuvers, Trehubov noted. As part of its effort to surround Velyka Novosilka, Russian troops are attempting to take control of access routes to the village through heavy fire, he added. Though the town is imperiled, some well-regarded Russian milbloggers say tough fighting remains. 'It is too early to talk about the liberation of the village, but the enemy no longer has a coherent defense,' Oleg Sarov said on Telegram. 'Fighting is going on throughout the village, the enemy is holding a number of concrete pillboxes, but Russian attack aircraft are gradually advancing. The controlled territory in the center is expanding, the flag is raised over the stadium in the eastern part.' While the Russians are making grinding advances across the eastern part of Ukraine, officials in Kyiv are particularly concerned that the fall of Velyka Novosilka could have a cascading effect. A Russian advance into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, which is solidly controlled by Ukraine, will further complicate Ukraine’s ability to defend its eastern region. The settlement of Velyka Novosilka is in a key sector of the eastern front. (Google Earth) This all comes as both sides are jockeying for position ahead of any possible ceasefire negotiations engineered by U.S. President Donald Trump. You can read more about that later in this story. The Latest Russian forces continue to have slow, halting momentum across most of the eastern front while making no gains to the south. Here are some of the key takeaways from the latest Institute for the Study of War (ISW) assessment. Kursk: Russian forces recently advanced in the Ukrainian salient in Kursk Oblast amid continued fighting in the area on January 23. Kharkiv: Russian forces continued limited ground attacks in the Kharkiv direction on January 23 but did not advance. Luhansk: Russian forces continued offensive operations in the Lyman, Kupyansk and Borova directions on January 23 but did not make confirmed advances. Donetsk: Russian forces continued limited ground attacks near and in Kurakhove, Chasiv Yar, southeast of Siversk near Ivano-Darivka on January 23 but did not advance. However, they recently gained ground in northern Toretsk and southwest of the town as well as southwest of Pokrovsk. Zaporizhzhia: Neither Russian nor Ukrainian sources reported ground activity in western Zaporizhia Oblast on January 23. Kherson: Russian forces continued limited ground attacks in the Dnipro direction in Kherson Oblast on January 22 and 23 with no advances reported.

'The year was very tense. It took place in conditions of constant active actions of the enemy, they attacked, we defended,' Oleksandr Syrskyi told Radio Bayraktar. 'But we also had some good news when we conducted a successful counter-offensive, an offensive operation in the Kursk sector, which greatly motivated our military personnel&#8230; And gave us hope that this offensive will not be the last.' The main conclusion of the Kursk operation, Syrsky added, is the need to prepare not only for defense but also for offense.

Deputy Head of the Office of the President Colonel Pavlo Palisa, speaking for the first time since assuming the position, said Ukraine is exploring new recruitment options because the current drafting system inherited from Soviet times is hindering progress. 'While Ukraine passed a mobilization law last spring and lowered the age of conscription from 27 to 25 years old, the measures have not had the impact needed to replenish its ranks or replace battlefield losses in its war with Russia,' the AP noted. The issue has been a huge point of contention with the U.S. and allies, who have urged Zelensky to increase the pool of recruits. However, even Ukrainian troops are beginning to wonder if this will be too little, too late.

A total of 121 drones were intercepted and destroyed, the MoD stated, while Ukraine claims the attack caused widespread damage. The Russian MoD says that Ukraine struck Bryansk, Ryazan, Kursk, Saratov, Rostov, Moscow, Belgorod, Voronezh, Tula, Oryol, Lipetsk and Crimea. The drones sparked fires at the Ryazan Oil Processing Company and the Ryazan oil pumping station and damage to the Kremniy El microelectronics plant in Russia’s Bryansk Oblast, according to the Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff. 'The plant produces a wide range of microchips and components used in strategically important weaponry systems,' the General Staff stated. 'In particular, the Topol-M’ and ‘Bulava,' rocket systems and the S-300 and S-400 surface-to-air missiles systems, as well as in onboard electronics of combat aircraft.' There was also 'damage to the Ryazan Thermal Power Plant, the Investigative Committee building on Krasnoarmeyskaya Street in Bryansk, and the building of the Institute of Management and Business on 2-aya Pochepskaya Street (also located in Bryansk),' the ASTRA news outlet reported on Telegram.

Trump Posts From His Truth Social (@TrumpDailyPosts) January 22, 2025 Trump also lashed out at Zelensky, saying the Ukrainian president is partly to blame for the war. 'He wants to settle now, he’s had enough,' Trump said of the Ukrainian leader in an interview with Fox News. 'He shouldn't have allowed this to happen either…He's no angel, but he shouldn't have allowed this war to happen.' During the interview, Trump chided Zelensky for taking on a much bigger enemy. 'First of all, he's fighting a much bigger entity, okay, much bigger when he was, you know, talking so brave,' Trump stated. 'So now two things happened. They were brave, but we gave them billions of dollars. The United States spent $200 billion more than Europe. Why did we spend more? You know why? Because Biden never asked Europe to spend more.' Instead of fighting, Trump suggested that Zelensky should have made a deal with Russia. 'Zelensky was fighting a much bigger entity, much bigger, much more powerful,' Trump posited. 'He shouldn't have done that, because we could have made a deal, and it would have been a deal that would have been, it would have been a nothing deal. I could have made that deal so easily. And Zelensky decided that ‘I want to fight.’' 'You know, they have 30,000 army tanks. Russia has 30,000 army tanks,' Trump continued. 'Zelensky had none practically. Then we started pouring equipment, pour and pour and pour. And they had the bravery to use the equipment. But in the end, this has to be settled.'

The Kyiv Independent (@KyivIndependent) January 15, 2025 During a fiery speech at Davos earlier this week, Zelensky urged Europe to do more to take care of itself. 'Most of the world’s now thinking – so, what’s gonna happen to their relationship with America?' Zelensky asked rhetorically. 'What will happen to alliances? To support? To trade? How does President Trump plan to end wars? But no one is asking these kinds of questions about Europe. And we need to be honest about that.' 'Europe can’t afford to be second or third in line for its allies,' he added. 'If that happens, the world will start moving forward without Europe, and that’s a world that won’t be comfortable or beneficial for Europeans.' Zelensky really hammered Europe in his Davos speech, addressing its future and the threats facing it.'Right now, all eyes are on Washington. But who’s actually watching Europe at the moment?' Here are some highlights from his speech Christopher Miller (@ChristopherJM) January 21, 2025 After leading his country through nearly three years of war, Zelensky is seeing his star sheen wear off and is facing a tough reelection.

Under the Constitution, elections must be called after martial law is lifted, the publication pointed out.

'By one measure, Mr. Zelensky still has the support of a majority of Ukrainians, albeit a slim one: 52 percent still have trust in the president, according to a poll in December by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology,' the Times reported. Polling data focusing on a hypothetical election shows Zelensky trailing a former commander in the military, Valery Zaluzhny, the Times stated. Zelensky fired Zaluzhzny as part of a sweeping overhaul of the military command and is now Ukraine’s ambassador to Britain. One survey, by the polling agency Leading Legal Initiatives, 'showed Mr. Zaluzhny winning a hypothetical first round of a two-stage election with 24 percent of the vote,' the Times explained. 'Mr. Zelensky trailed, with 16 percent; and [former Prime Minister Yulia] Tymoshenko, the opposition figure, came in third place with 12 percent. Neither Mr. Zaluzhny nor Ms. Tymoshenko has declared an intention to run.' Zelensky's waning popularity may be extending abroad too. Unlike former Tymoshenko, who attended some of Trump's inaugural events, Zelensky was not invited and said he would only come if he was.

Army Rangers Used Gun-Toting Fire Engine Ladders Mounted On Amphi...	In addition to kickstarting the liberation of Western Europe, the Allied invasion of Normandy in World War II, now best known as D-Day, is famous for the many specialist vehicles that were developed to ensure it went to plan. Alongside the various ‘Funny’ Tanks that played an important role in the amphibious landings, there was a truly bizarre version of the DUKW (or ‘Duck’) amphibious truck, outfitted with an extension ladder to scale cliffs in northern France and then rain down suppressive fire on the German defenders. A photo taken of one of the ladder-equipped DUKW vehicles during a training exercise before D-Day. The gunner has climbed to the top of the ladder to operate the guns. Public Domain Before looking at the little-known modification of the DUKW, it’s worth recalling the huge efforts that went into developing a range of specialized vehicles to support the D-Day landings, which posed some enormous challenges. As well as getting from the landing craft to the beach, these vehicles would have to battle with extensive German coastal defenses, while also negotiating soft sand and shingle and a range of beach obstacles. Someone must have said 'no' to the idea. (A Swan: a DUKW fitted with a 100 feet extensible ladder.) #WW2 #HISTORY pic.twitter.com/xJuWw72Pcz&mdash; RG Poulussen (@rgpoulussen) June 21, 2024 Among the more celebrated of the D-Day ‘Funnies’ were the Duplex Drive (DD) ‘swimming’ amphibious tanks, mine-clearing flail tanks, armored engineer vehicles to smash through beach defenses, including bunkers and gun emplacements, and carpet-layer tanks that could place reinforced matting across soft beaches to allow other heavy armor to follow. A British Army Valentine DD amphibious tank, with its flotation screen erected, moves in the water alongside a landing craft, in January 1944. Public Domain The cliff-assault version of the DUKW was tailored for the very specific role of scaling the Pointe du Hoc, a 110-foot cliff that was roughly midway between Utah and Omaha Beaches, on the northwestern coast of Normandy. This formed part of the Germans’ Atlantic Wall fortifications. At the top of the cliff, the Germans had assembled six 155mm coastal artillery guns, defended from ground assault by infantry and from air attack by 20mm anti-aircraft cannons. There was also an assortment of bunkers and machine gun posts. The approximate location of the Pointe du Hoc, roughly midway between Utah and Omaha Beaches, on the northwestern coast of Normandy. Tom Fish, geo.fish // Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0 By D-Day, on June 6, 1944, the 155mm guns had been moved inland but it was determined that the cliff top would still need to be taken by ground forces, to prevent the Germans from using this strategic position against the Allied invasion force. After all, the Germans had begun to install four new casemates on the cliff top and it would have been possible to move the 155mm guns, or alternative weapons back there. A view of the Pointe du Hoc today reveals something of the challenge of scaling the cliffs. Myrabella / Wikimedia Commons / CC BY-SA 3.0 As for the DUKW, this vehicle was already well-established for amphibious operations. Based on the 2½-ton CCKW truck from the General Motors Corporation (GMC), it was a six-wheel-drive amphibious vehicle. Its main amphibious assault role was to take supplies from ships anchored offshore and bring them directly to the beachhead. Before D-Day, DUKWs had been used at Guadalcanal in the Pacific and in the invasion of Sicily. A standard DUKW amphibious truck carries a load of blood and medical personnel from a landing beach during the invasion of southern France, in August 1944. U.S. National Archives Among the best accounts of the DUKW’s role in the assault on Pointe du Hoc is provided by the website Mike’s Research, with the article on this topic worth reading in full. The assault was to be made by the U.S. 2nd Ranger Battalion under the command of Lt. Col. James Earl Rudder. The force was to be divided into three separate elements that would land below the cliff, to the east, and to the west, respectively. These elements would arrive aboard 10 Landing Craft, Assault (LCA), with additional supplies carried in two more LCAs. The force would also be provided with four special DUKWs, each of which had a 100-foot extension ladder. Befitting the innovative and somewhat ad-hoc approach to the D-Day ‘Funnies,’ these ladders were obtained from the London Fire Brigade, apparently taken from that service’s Dennis Merryweather Turntable Ladder trucks. A map of the assault plan for the Pointe du Hoc. Public Domain The plan for the assault on Pointe du Hoc called for the Rangers to assemble at the beach below, and then scale the cliffs using ropes, ladders, and grapples. This would have to be done while under fire, before neutralizing the German positions and defending them until reinforcements arrived. As well as their ladders, the modified DUKWs also had armament, to provide suppressive fire. Nevertheless, it was a huge ask for the soldier at the top of the ladder to operate these weapons as they teetered toward the top of the cliff, while on the receiving end of German defensive fire. While accounts differ, it seems almost certain the weapons on the top of the adapted DUKW’s ladder were British-made Vickers K machine guns, also known as the Vickers Gas Operated. Originally developed to arm aircraft, the weapon, in 0.303in caliber, was likely chosen due to its high rate of fire — 950-1,200 rounds per minute. It also offered a large magazine compared to the more commonly used Bren gun of the same caliber.

Public Domain Richard Ash A poor-quality but nonetheless interesting video showing training for the Pointe du Hoc operation, including the ladder-equipped DUKWs: While the initial installation featured three guns at the top of the ladder and can be seen in pre-assault training videos, this was apparently reduced to a pair of guns for the actual operation. According to the account provided by Mike’s Research, the assault on Pointe du Hoc began at 5:30 a.m., when naval bombardment targeted the invasion beach, including the German positions atop the cliff. Despite covering fire from a pair of U.S. Navy destroyers, and from Allied aircraft, the Rangers’ passage to the beach was far from straightforward. As well as German defensive fire, they had to deal with high waves, and one of the LCAs was sunk, while another took on water and was swamped. Of the LCAs carrying supplies, one was also sunk and the other became so full of water that most of its cargo had to be thrown overboard. Rangers demonstrate the rope ladders they used to scale the cliffs at Pointe du Hoc. U.S. Navy Of the four DUKWs, one was targeted by German 20mm fire and sank, around 300 yards from the shore, at which distance the Rangers’ invasion force started to face mortar and machine gun fire. Nevertheless, the surviving LCAs and DUKWs made it to the beach, at 7:10 a.m. Mortars were used to launch grappling hooks at the top of the cliff and the Rangers started their rope climb to the summit. Unfortunately, the three remaining DUKWs were now stalled along the shoreline, either stranded in the sand or unable to move across the cratered beach. Some accounts suggest that the ladders were not long enough anyway, which would seem plausible considering their 100-foot length and the tops of the cliffs being around 110 feet. A surviving German bunker observation post at the top of the Pointe du Hoc. Archangel12/Wikimedia Commons Thinking quickly, Lt. Col. Rudder ordered the ladders be raised anyway, to provide elevated positions from where the German defenses could be engaged with the mounted guns. As Mike’s Research recounts: 'While perched on the top rungs, brave Rangers sprayed the top of the cliff with automatic rifle fire. While providing fire support from the top of one of the DUKW ladders, Private Malcolm Arnold observed waves of Rangers climbing up the cliff under fire from above and with grenades exploding around them. A number of Rangers fell when the Germans cut their ropes. After the successful cliff assault, the Rangers neutralized the position and later repelled several counterattacks…' A poor-quality but interesting photo of a ladder-equipped DUKW vehicle during a training exercise at the bottom of a cliff, likely on the Isle of Wight, in England. Public Domain While the special DUKWs may not have been used as they were intended, it seems clear they helped bring about a successful conclusion to the operation. Fighting continued into the night of June 6, with the Rangers pinned back on the top of the cliff, some being captured by the Germans. But they held their ground until the 8th when they were relieved by more Rangers as well as U.S. infantry and elements of a tank battalion, which had meanwhile arrived from Omaha beach. The scene at the top of Point du Hoc after relief forces had reached the Rangers. German prisoners can be seen being moved in the background after their capture. Public Domain Although the heavier 155mm guns had already been moved from the top of the cliff, Rangers managed to locate five German guns and destroy them with thermite grenades. By the time reinforcements arrived, of the original force of 225 soldiers that had landed at the Pointe, 77 had been killed, with another 152 wounded. With only four of the ladder-equipped DUKWs known to have been sent into combat, it’s perhaps not surprising that the story of these highly unusual vehicles is now barely known.

Public Domain However, the ingenuity of the underlying concept, as well as the bravery of the soldiers that operated them, and those that fought alongside them was reflected across the Allied invasion of Normandy and ensured that it would be a fundamental turning point in the war in Western Europe.

Ukrainian Leopard 1 Tank Survived A Dozen Drone Strikes: Report	One of Ukraine’s Cold War-era Leopard 1 main battle tanks survived as many as a dozen hits from Russian first-person view (FPV) attack drones, according to Ukrainian sources. The incident underscores the proliferation of this particular threat on the battlefield but also points to the effectiveness of the ‘up-armored’ version of the venerable Leopard 1, examples of which have received a variety of different protective measures in Ukrainian service. A video published by the Ukrainian Militarnyi news outlet shows the tank in question, repeatedly being struck by drones, in a compilation of footage taken from original Russian sources. While it’s hard to say with certainty that we are seeing the same tank throughout the video, in the first part, at least, the same tank is seen from the perspective of multiple drones in the same location, parked among trees. We then see what’s purportedly the same vehicle moving along a tree-lined road, where it’s again targeted on multiple occasions. According to Ukrainian sources, the tank, a Leopard 1A5, survived no fewer than a dozen hits from the quadcopter-type FPV drones. The tank was first detected by Russian forces while stationary in a treeline. In this position, the Leopard 1 was targeted by five FPV drones. 'The tank withstood three hits to the frontal part, as well as two more to the left side and rear of the hull,' Militarnyi reports. After that, the tank moved away from its initial position on the treeline and began to move along a road. Here it stopped for some reason and came under attack again. It took another three drone hits, apparently to the hull above the engine and transmission compartment. This was still not enough to immobilize it, and it began to move forward again, after which 'two subsequent hits to the same spot stopped the tank and probably caused a fire.' It’s unclear what happened to the tank crew, but the Ukrainian report suggests that they likely escaped from the tank before it was put out of action, noting that most of the hits were not to the crew compartments and the time interval between the drones’ arrivals was sufficient for the soldiers to evacuate. Provided the crew did escape, their survival was certainly helped by the additional protective measures that have been added to the Leopard 1s by the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ Main Armored Directorate.

(Photo by Roman PILIPEY / AFP) ROMAN PILIPEY The most obvious of these modifications in the video is the ‘cope cage’ structure over the turret. These overhead metal screens have become a trademark of Ukrainian and Russian vehicles fighting in Ukraine and are intended to deflect FPV ‘kamikaze’ drones as well as drone-dropped mortars. Further protection is provided by netting, draped over the cage. The up-armored Leopard 1 also features nets elsewhere as well as grille-type slat armor over the more vulnerable rear part of the hull. Slat armor is designed to protect against the shaped charges in many anti-tank rounds, which need to detonate at certain distances from the target to be most effective. In the meantime, shaped charges and repurposed anti-tank projectiles are common payloads for FPV drones, as well.

ERA functions by detonating on impact before the round hits the tank’s hull. The counter-blast effect can disrupt the weapon’s effects or destroy it outright. A Ukrainian Leopard 1A5 almost entirely covered in ERA bricks. via X In the past, we have seen Ukrainian tanks, including Western-supplied ones, covered with an extensive outer layer of Soviet-era Kontakt ERA bricks, also used by Russia to enhance the protection of a range of different platforms. Were it not for these measures, 'the basic version of the Leopard would most likely have been destroyed by the first hits along with the crew,' the Militarnyi report contends. After all, the original Leopard 1 developed in the 1960s was designed to provide protection against very different kinds of threats than those encountered on the battlefield in Ukraine, primarily the main guns of enemy tanks and anti-tank guns.

(Photo by Ronny HARTMANN / AFP) RONNY HARTMANN Other, non-kinetic defensive measures have also been added to fighting vehicles used by both Ukraine and Russia, although the Leopard 1 in the video was apparently not fitted with any kind of electronic warfare equipment to disrupt the control systems of the attacking drones. While this likely reflects the limited availability of these kinds of systems, it should also be noted that Russia is making increasing use of FPV drones controlled using fiber-optic cables, which cannot be disrupted by Ukrainian jamming. Evading FPV drones is now frequently essential for survival in the Russia-Ukraine war and we have previously profiled some other standout incidents, including the Russian T-80 tank that came under sustained attack by a succession of explosive-laden FPV drones before apparently making good its escape. You can see the video of that engagement embedded below.

These were refurbished before being delivered and were also joined by further examples drawn from Belgian and Dutch stocks. The first of these tanks had begun to arrive in Ukraine in the summer of 2023. By providing additional protection, using the package developed by the Main Armored Directorate, Ukraine has demonstrated that the old Leopard 1 can still play a useful role on the battlefield, although its presence also reflects the limited numbers of more modern tanks that Ukraine has available. While 155 Leopard 1s have been made available to Ukraine so far, the country only received 31 U.S.-supplied M1A1 Abrams and 29 Leopard 2A4s. A recent video shows a Ukrainian Leopard 1 engaging Russian soldiers hiding out in a ruined building in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine.: Ukrainian Leopard 1 tank crew of the 1st Tank Battalion of 5th Heavy Mechanized Brigade fires at orcs trying to hide in the ruins of a school.

January 2025.&mdash; Baba Yaga Fèlla (@babayaga.fellas.social) 2025-01-23T00:59:06.648Z The Leopard 1 is no longer used by Germany, but there are significant numbers available from storage depots. However, the issue of securing ammunition for the older tank’s 105mm rifled main gun could be difficult to resolve in the long term. For now, however, the Leopard 1 remains very much in the thick of the action on the front lines. This recent video provides a remarkable demonstration of the resilience of the tank, once it has been provided with additional Ukrainian-sourced protective measures and once again highlights the ever-present threat of FPV drones on the battlefield.

XQ-67 Drone Getting Overhauled With New Capabilities As Part Of D...	The U.S. Air Force's XQ-67A drone is set to receive modifications and upgrades to demonstrate its ability to perform certain missions as part of a program called Demon Ape. Originally developed as a ‘sensor truck’ for the once-secretive Off-Board Sensing Station (OBSS) program, the stealthy XQ-67A is now being used as a testbed to support the Air Force's larger Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) advanced drone effort. General Atomics, which built the drone, has also confirmed that it served as the basis for its now-in-development CCA design. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) awarded General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. (GA-ASI) a sole-source contract for the Demon Ape-related work on January 17. Demon Ape is actually a forced acronym standing for Demonstration of Autonomous Collaborative Platform Performance and Effectiveness. The XQ-67A broke cover in February 2024, which TWZ was the first to report, and it made its maiden flight later that month. 'The Government currently requires a mix of research and data, hardware, and software in support of continuing the research and development of the XQ-67A,' according to an online notice about the contract award. 'That work consists of integrating specific mission systems and upgrading the vehicle to ensure adequate power generation and thermal management capacity.' A copy of the formal justification for the sole-source contract is attached to the notice, but is heavily redacted. Still, it does provide some additional details, including that the changes to the XQ-67A are tied to at least one specific mission set. 'The Government intends to continue the research and development of the XQ-67A by modifying the aircraft [redacted],' the justification document says. 'For the XQ-67A to perform this mission, the offeror will have to integrate the specific mission systems [redacted] as well as upgrade to ensure adequate power generation and thermal management capacity.' 'At the conclusion of OBSS, the XQ-67A will have designs ready for the integration of mission systems,' the Air Force's justification for the sole-source contract adds. 'Additionally, the XQ-67A will have been integrated with critical mission infrastructure [redacted].' TWZ has reached out to the Air Force and General Atomics for more information. As we have written in the past: '[The] XQ-67A has what could be large side-looking airborne radar (SLAR) apertures on both sides of the forward fuselage, but that these could also be weapons bays. SLAR would make more sense for XQ-67A based on what we know of the Air Force’s separate and secretive Off-Board Sensing Station (OBSS) program under which the drone was developed. At the same time, the spaces along the sides of the forward fuselage could be modular or otherwise readily adaptable. Earlier this year [2024], the Air Force also disclosed the existence of an Off-Board Weapon Station (OBWS) effort related to the OBSS project, as you can learn more about here.' A large aperture or bay is visible on the left side of the forward fuselage in this picture of the XQ-67A. USAF Courtesy photo via USAF The forthcoming modifications and upgrades might include reconfiguring the XQ-67A to be able to demonstrate capabilities more in line with the OBWS concept. If that is the case, that would also bring the drone even more in line with General Atomics CCA design. The Air Force has said it wants its first tranche of CCAs to be focused, at least initially, on serving as air-to-air ‘missile trucks’ that will operate closely with crewed combat jets. Air-to-ground strike, electronic warfare, networking node, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) have also been put forward as potential future CCA mission sets. The Air Force is also running the CCA program in iterative development cycles, with General Atomics along with Anduril now developing designs as part of the initial Increment 1. There is increasing evidence that the requirements for Increment 2 will call for more capable, and by extension more expensive, designs that might be tasked with additional missions. Models of the Increment 1 CCA designs from General Atomics (top) and Anduril (bottom). General Atomics/Jamie Hunter Whatever the new modifications and upgrades to the XQ-67A might entail, the Demon Ape work also looks set to further prove out the so-called 'genus/species' concept central to the OBSS program and a predecessor effort known as Low Cost Attritable Aircraft Platform Sharing (LCAAPS). The basic concept involves the use of a core 'genus' set of components from which multiple 'species' of differently configured drones can be crafted. General Atomics has also been pioneering this concept with its Gambit drone family, which all use a common 'chassis' that includes landing gear, as well as critical mission and flight control computer systems. '[Now former] Secretary of the Air Force, Mr. Frank Kendall, stated that future air dominance will include 'the introduction of uncrewed collaborative aircraft to provide affordable mass and dramatically increased cost effectiveness.' The focus on delivering 'affordable mass' means that novel developmental approaches must be proven to drastically drive down costs,' the justification for the new Demon Ape contract explains. 'Additionally, it is critical to shorten the development timeline, otherwise the Air Force would not be able to deliver enough aircraft to enable mass.' 'As a result of the OBSS program, the Air Force has captured the hardware and software design data in Technical Data Packages, and has that design data. At the hardware level, the system is designed and built around a Genus common platform architecture. The Air Force has rights to the design of the Genus and its technical data,' the justification document adds. 'Development of new Species aircraft variants by other vendors using the Genus as the starting point is possible. The Air Force also has most of the rights to the OBSS Species aircraft variant. Development and insertion of different vendors' technologies or subsystems into the Species is possible. At the software level, the Air Force is requiring insertion of which will allow for integration of software applications, algorithms and skills that could be developed by any vendor. The open nature of the design will allow for competition in these aspects of the project in the future.' USAF The XQ-67A drone seen during its first flight.

The company has been making significant investments in new and improved rapid design and manufacturing capabilities in recent years. As already noted, the Air Force has previously stated that work on OBSS, to include this kind of modular open-architecture approach, is now feeding into the larger CCA effort. '[Speaking] from the [Air Force] Test Center [AFTC] perspective, but also having some experience with the Lab [the Air Force Research Laboratory; AFRL], we went through a long process of developing that technology,' Air Force Maj. Gen. Scott Cain told The War Zone and other reporters at the Air & Space Forces Association's main annual conference last September. 'Our steps that we took … were proving out that system [the XQ-67] and making sure that it got through that first flight and airworthiness. And now that has been picked up … that program, OBSS, … did a seamless transition over to the CCA program.' 'So the Test Center supported the Lab in getting XQ-67 to that first flight and to do some early characterization of the platform,' Cain, who was then head of AFTC and had previously been in charge of AFRL, added at that time. 'There are other lessons from this about building a common chassis that will be carried forward. And the CCA program is ingesting those and thinking about those for future increments of the system.' As has been mentioned, the Air Force is still very much refining its requirements for CCA's Increment 2. The service also announced additional Increment 1 CCA orders last year that it said would help in the development of new concepts of operations and tactics, techniques, and procedures for the employment of those initial drones. Air Force officials have said that they expect to purchase between 100 and 150 Increment 1 CCAs, in total. A composite of renderings of the CCA designs from General Atomics (at top) and Anduril (at bottom). General Atomics/Anduril Whether the operational Increment 1 CCA force ultimately consists of General Atomics or Anduril types, or a mix of both, remains to be seen. As TWZ has noted before, General Atomics' work on the XQ-67A, both as a flying risk reduction prototype for its CCA design and as a broader testbed, has certainly given the company a running start. General Atomics has decades of additional experience in developing and serial production of other drones, including the famous MQ-1 and MQ-9 families. The Air Force is also still finalizing how the drones will be integrated into its force structure, training cycles, and logistics chains. Technical questions, including those surrounding command and control, from the required communications networking capabilities to physical interfaces human operators will use to manage the drones, need to be answered, as well, as you can read more about here. Outside of the CCA program, the Air Force has a number of efforts underway to help answer these various questions. This includes Demon Ape, which is now set to get a modified and upgraded XQ-67A to continue its work. UPDATE: 2:05 PM EST — General Atomics has now provided us with some additional context about the XQ-67A and the Demon Ape program. 'The Demonstration of ACP Performance and Effectiveness program, also called Demon APE, is the next logical step for the overall CCA concept,' C. Mark Brinkley, a company spokesperson, told TWZ in a statement. 'First, we build and fly this nontraditional unmanned jet in an Off-Board Sensing Station configuration. OBSS has goals that are separate from CCA, but they still live inside this larger concept for the future of air superiority.' 'So you have one modular, central core yielding numerous Autonomous Collaborative Platform configurations. OBSS is a sensor, CCA is a shooter, but you can also have EW, fighter/attack, whatever,' he continued. 'You’re not starting over every time, trying to figure out how to build landing gear and where to put the payloads. The modularity we’ve demonstrated means you can go from new variant to new variant very fast and generate a lot of commonality.' 'Also in parallel, Demon APE is advancing OBSS directly by integrating specific mission systems and upgrades to meet the goals for that program,' he added. 'I can’t talk about what those are specifically, but the name tells you a lot: Off-Board Sensing Station. These new systems require adequate power generation and thermal management, and Demon APE is doing that now.'

North Korean Rocket Launcher Disguised As Civilian Truck May Have...	A North Korean multiple launch rocket system (MLRS) designed to be disguised as a common truck looks to have appeared in Russia’s Kursk region. The unique vehicle's arrival there would be part of Pyongyang’s military support for Moscow’s war effort. We reported just yesterday that North Korea is increasing its supply or artillery troops and hardware to Russia, especially for use in the Kursk region. The 'hiding in plain sight' MLRS based on a civilian truck platform is a concept that we have seen before in North Korea and a cruder version of which has also been previously used in combat by Iraqi militias.

Korean 122mm MLRS filmed in Kursk. pic.twitter.com/fziMy5lfTW&mdash; 𝔗𝔥𝔢 𝕯𝔢𝔞𝔡 𝕯𝔦𝔰𝔱𝔯𝔦𝔠𝔱△ (@TheDeadDistrict) January 23, 2025 A brief video showing the civilian-truck-based North Korean MLRS began to circulate today on social media. Ukrainian and Russian military bloggers alike have stated that the MLRS was spotted in Kursk, although we cannot currently verify the location in which the footage was shot. The MLRS in the footage certainly appears to be identical to a North Korean one that was first noted during a military parade in Pyongyang, as TWZ reported at the time. During the parade in September 2023 marking the 75th anniversary of North Korea’s founding, the country’s Worker-Peasant Red Guards paramilitary force unveiled a fleet of MLRS disguised as civilian trucks that match perfectly with the vehicle depicted in the video. Worker-Peasant Red Guard rocket launchers concealed within container trucks during a parade in Pyongyang on September 9, 2023. KCNA The weapon in question is based on a box truck with 12 tubes each of what appear to be 122mm artillery rockets deployed via their pop-up and sliding-door roofs. The parade also included a dump truck version of the MLRS, alongside agricultural tractors pulling rocket launchers and anti-tank guided missiles on trailers. North Korean fake dump trucks that can have rocket artillery concealed inside. KCNA North Korean civilian tractors pulling trailers with anti-tank missiles, rocket artillery, and anti-aircraft guns attached. KCNA As we discussed previously, these kinds of weapons make a lot of sense in terms of North Korean operational tactics, masquerading as civilian vehicles before swinging into action should a conflict kick off on the Korean peninsula. Once the fighting has begun, the MLRS could roam around more freely, appearing as a normal truck, then quickly firing, relocating, and doing so repeatedly, making the enemy’s targeting plans that much more complicated. On the battlefields of Ukraine, an MLRS that’s disguised as a civilian truck would also have considerable value. This would apply in the Kursk region, where Russian and North Korean forces are engaged in a counteroffensive against Ukrainian forces that launched an assault there last summer, but also across large swaths of eastern Ukraine that are controlled by Russia. The fact that the MLRS can move around the fringes of where fighting is taking place without necessarily arousing outright suspicion would be a big deal, and this would be aided by the extensive road networks existing in these areas, where, in some cases, there is no shortage of civilian traffic to blend in with. Ukrainian forces are already using considerable resources to try and identify and then engage Russian units — and especially artillery and air defense systems — as they are brought into battle. Having another level of camouflage and concealment would make that even more complicated. Among the lessons of the conflict in Ukraine is the vulnerability of equipment on and around the battlefield, especially to drone attacks, putting huge pressure on keeping equipment out of sight as much as possible, or at least confusing the enemy as to what they are seeing and subsequently prioritizing for targeting. The possibility that any given anonymous-looking truck moving on a road could actually be concealing rocket artillery therefore adds a whole new dynamic. On the other hand, this kind of artillery is far less mobile outside of existing roads compared to traditional MLRS and it’s unclear if it features any kind of protection, even against small-arms fire and shrapnel. That is less of a concern though as 122mm 'Grad' rockets can saturate target areas over ten miles away, allowing them to be employed behind the front lines and towards the extent of many traditional and unassisted first person video drones' practical range. Another view of North Korean rocket launchers concealed within container trucks during a parade in Pyongyang. KCNA It's possible that North Korea may have sent this kind of MLRS to Russia due to availability or perhaps as some kind of combat trial, especially bearing in mind the fact that this is a relatively new system. For the time being, we will have to wait for more evidence to confirm that this type of MLRS is really in the Kursk region and, if so, how it might be employed and by whom. There is, however, a precedent for this type of MLRS being used in combat. Back in 2023, TWZ reported on how Iranian-backed militants in Iraq fired 122mm artillery rockets at U.S.-led coalition forces in neighboring Syria using an improvised array of launchers disguised inside a modified tanker truck. A video clip, seen in the social media post below, emerged showing this vehicle in action.

At least three rockets can be seen still inside the launch tubes. CENTCOM Concealed improvised rocket launchers have been seen on multiple occasions in the hands of Iraqi militants, ever since the immediate aftermath of the U.S.-led invasion of the country in 2003. In the process, various types of commercial trucks have been modified in this way over the years. In the meantime, the concept of concealing weapons in anonymous-looking containers has gained more traction around the world. Most notably, Israel and Russia, among other countries, have developed missile launchers disguised to look like shipping containers, able to be hidden among normal deck cargo or within industrial areas from which to launch attacks. Returning to Ukraine, only yesterday we reported on how North Korea was expected to send reinforcements to Kursk imminently. Kyiv’s military intelligence chief told TWZexclusively that these reinforcements will mostly comprise missile and artillery troops who typically operate hundreds of tubed and rocket artillery systems as well as the KN-23 short-range ballistic missiles Pyongyang has already provided Moscow. The wreckage of a North Korean missile is shown in a briefing dedicated to the Russian shelling of Kharkiv by North Korean missiles on March 14, 2024, in Kharkiv, Ukraine. Photo by Denys Glushko /Gwara Media/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images Global Images Ukraine The artillery was expected to be used to support both North Korean and Russian operations, although the missiles would be reserved for Russian objectives. Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR), also told us that the North Koreans would train Russian soldiers on all of those systems. Aside from the thousands of troops North Korea has now committed to the conflict, especially in the Kursk region, Pyongyang has already supplied Russia with huge amounts of weaponry, including desperately needed artillery rounds and various kinds of other ammunition, amounting to millions of individual projectiles. TWZ has also reported on the appearance of North Korean 170mm M1989 Koksan self-propelled artillery pieces being deployed in the Ukraine war and, more recently, a North Korean-made mobile surface-to-air missile system, the designation of which remains unconfirmed. Again, it’s not clear if these are being used exclusively by North Korean troops or whether they have been supplied to Russia. What is meanwhile clear is that North Korea is stepping up its military support for Russia’s war with Ukraine, including providing an increasingly varied array of heavy weapons.

F-35 AI-Enabled Drone Controller Capability Successfully Demonstr...	Lockheed Martin says the stealthy F-35 Joint Strike Fighter now has a firmly demonstrated ability to act as an in-flight 'quarterback' for advanced drones like the U.S. Air Force's future Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) with the help of artificial intelligence-enabled systems. The company states that its testing has also shown a touchscreen tablet-like device is a workable interface for controlling multiple uncrewed aircraft simultaneously from the cockpit of the F-35, as well as the F-22 Raptor. For the U.S. Air Force, how pilots in crewed aircraft will actually manage CCAs during operations has emerged as an increasingly important question. Details about F-35 and F-22 related crewed-uncrewed teaming developments were included in a press release that Lockheed Martin put out late yesterday that wrapped up various achievements for the company in 2024. Lockheed Martin The F-35 'has the capability to control drones, including the U.S. Air Force’s future fleet of Collaborative Combat Aircraft. Recently, Lockheed Martin and industry partners demonstrated end-to-end connectivity including the seamless integration of AI technologies to control a drone in flight utilizing the same hardware and software architectures built for future F-35 flight testing,' the press release says. 'These AI-enabled architectures allow Lockheed Martin to not only prove out piloted-drone teaming capabilities, but also incrementally improve them, bringing the U.S. Air Force’s family of systems vision to life.' 'Lockheed Martin has demonstrated its piloted-drone teaming interface, which can control multiple drones from the cockpit of an F-35 or F-22,' the release adds. 'This technology allows a pilot to direct multiple drones to engage enemies using a touchscreen tablet in the cockpit of their 5th Gen aircraft.' A US Air Force image depicting an F-22 Raptor stealth fighter flying together with a Boeing MQ-28 Ghost Bat drone. USAF A US Air Force image depicting an MQ-28 Ghost Bat flying together with an F-22 Raptor stealth fighter. USAF The press release also highlights prior crewed-uncrewed teaming work that Lockheed Martin's famed Skunk Works advanced projects division has done with the University of Iowa’s Operator Performance Laboratory (OPL) using surrogate platforms. OPL has also been working with other companies, including Shield AI, as well as the U.S. military, to support advanced autonomy and drone development efforts in recent years. In November 2024, Lockheed Martin notably announced that it had conducted tests with OPL that saw a human controller in an L-39 Albatros jet use a touchscreen interface to order two L-29 Delfin jets equipped with AI-enabled flight technology acting as surrogate drones to engage simulated enemy fighters. This sounds very similar to the kind of control architecture the company says it has now demonstrated on the F-35. A view of the 'battle manager' at work in the back seat of the L-39 jet during issuing commands to the L-29s acting as surrogate drones. Lockheed Martin When it comes to the Air Force's CCA program, the effort is currently structured around iterative development cycles, with Anduril and General Atomics developing different drones now under what is known as Increment 1. Dozens of other contractors are working on ancillary developments, including autonomous technologies and control systems. The Air Force is still refining its requirements for Increment 2, but they are increasingly expected to call for more capable uncrewed aircraft designs that will also be more expensive. For its part, Lockheed Martin said last year that its losing pitch for Increment 1 was a very stealthy 'gold plated' drone and that it has since refocused its attention on lower-cost, potentially even expendable designs. Models of the drones General Atomics (at top) and Anduril (at bottom) are developing as part of the CCA program's Increment 1. General Atomics/Jamie Hunter Air Force officials have said that the service could eventually buy between 100 and 150 Increment 1 CCAs, and thousands of drones across all of the programs increments. The F-35 has also been identified in the past as one of the expected initial crewed companions for the drones. Even before the CCA concept was publicly codified, Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works had outlined a detailed crewed-uncrewed teaming vision that included the Joint Strike Fighter. The Air Force is also still very much in the process of developing new concepts of operations and tactics, techniques, and procedures for employing CCA drones operationally. How the drones will fit into the service's force structure and be utilized in routine training and other day-to-day peacetime activities, along with what the maintenance and logistical demands will be, also remain to be seen. Questions about in-flight command and control have emerged as particularly important ones to answer in the near term. 'I was just talking to our program manager downstairs… and we were talking about what we think the number of aircraft, CCAs, that can be controlled by a crewed aircraft [is]. And I initially started out with a range of three to five,' Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall told TWZ and other reporters at the Air & Space Forces Association's (AFA) main annual conference last September. 'We’re talking about bigger numbers than that now. So we’re moving towards greater reliance on uncrewed aircraft working with crewed platforms to achieve air superiority and to do other missions.' 'One of the things you have to have if you’re going to use CCAs and have them be armed and … lethal is that they have to be under tight control. And, for me, one of the elements of that needs to be line-of-sight communications. And I think that that’s an important thing to have in the mix, secure, reliable line-of-sight communications. We’re not going to have aircraft going out and doing engagements uncontrolled,' the Air Force’s top civilian added at that time. 'So the default, if they lose communications, would be for them to return to base, which takes them out of the fight. So we don’t want that to happen. And when they do do engagements, … we want them under tight control. So I think the mix of crewed and uncrewed aircraft, I think, is going to be the right answer for the foreseeable future.' As Lockheed Martin's new touting of its work on tablet-based control interfaces highlights, there is a significant debate now just about how pilots will physically issue orders and otherwise manage drones from their cockpits. A picture of a drone control system using a tablet-like device that General Atomics has previously released. GA-ASI 'There’s a lot of opinions amongst the Air Force about the right way to go [about controlling drones from other aircraft],' John Clark, then head of Skunk Works, also told The War Zone and others at the AFA gathering in September 2024. 'The universal thought, though, is that this [a tablet or other touch-based interface] may be the fastest way to begin experimentation. It may not be the end state.' 'We’re working through a spectrum of options that are the minimum invasive opportunities, as well as something that’s more organically equipped, where there’s not even a tablet,' Clark added. 'We started with [the Air Force’s] Air Combat Command with tablets… There was this idea that they wanted to have this discreet control,' Michael Atwood, Vice President of Advanced Programs for General Atomics, had previously said during an appearance on The Merge podcast in 2024. 'I got to fly in one of these jets with a tablet. And it was really hard to fly the airplane, let alone the weapon system of my primary airplane, and spatially and temporally think about this other thing.' The F-35 notably has the benefit here of already having an advanced wide-area digital touchscreen display in its cockpit. The Technology Refresh-3 (TR-3) configuration for the jets, which provides the software and hardware backbones to support the forthcoming Block 4 upgrades, also includes an enhanced panoramic cockpit display. Collins Aerospace, a division of Raytheon (now formally known as RTX), put out a glitzy computer-generated video last year, seen below, that offered a vision for how pilots might control CCA-like drones in the future. This included the F-35's in-cockpit display being used for this purpose. The issuing of commands via tablet-like devices was also depicted. A screen capture from the Collins Aerospace video showing the F-35's in-cockpit display being used to issue commands to nearby drones. Collins Aerospace capture In addition, there are still many questions about the secure communications architectures that will be needed to support operations involving CCAs and similar drones, as well as for F-35s and F-22s to operate effectively in the airborne controller role. The F-35 could use the popular omnidirectional Link 16 network for this purpose, but doing so would make it easier for opponents to detect the fighter jet and the drone. The F-22, which has long only had the ability to transmit and not receive data via Link 16, faces similar issues. Both the Joint Strike Fighter and the Raptor have specialized directional low probability of intercept/low probability of detection (LPI/LPD) datalinks, the Multifunctional Advanced Data Link (MADL) and Intra-Flight Data Link (IFDL), respectively. However, MADL cannot 'talk' to IFDL, or vice versa, and neither one can communicate directly with other links. Lockheed Martin and the U.S. military have been actively working on ways to 'translate' between MADL and IFDL, as well as between those links and others, including via communications gateway nodes on other crewed and uncrewed aircraft, in recent years. Regardless, equipping the drones themselves with MADL or IFDL could allow for direct highly-secure, jam resistant command links. We have seen the XQ-58 equipped with MADL, for instance, during tests. Using drones as translators and rebroadcasting nodes could work as well. A briefing slide discussing some of the general capabilities of IFDL and MADL. DARPA Regardless, Lockheed Martin's centering of the F-35 (and the F-22 to a lesser degree) in this discussion is also interesting given the significant uncertainty around plans for a new crewed sixth-generation stealth combat jet as part of the Air Force's larger Next-Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative. NGAD also includes the CCA program. Acting as an airborne drone controller has long been envisioned as a key role for the NGAD combat jet effort, which was originally crafted as a replacement for the F-22 and was subjected to a deep review last year. Various alternatives have been evaluated, including a significantly pared-back concept described as more of an F-35 follow-on that is focused primarily on the drone control mission. The Air Force has also separately backed off on any timeline for retiring the F-22, which continues to receive significant new upgrades. President Donald Trump's administration now has the task of deciding how to proceed, or not, with the NGAD combat jet amid broader serious concerns about the affordability of various top-priority Air Force programs, including the CCA program and plans for future stealth tankers. The service has previously said that the ballooning cost of the Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile program, specifically, was a key factor in the decision to review the NGAD combat jet effort. A rendering of a notional sixth-generation combat jet flying with a trio of drones. Collins Aerospace Expanding the ability of the F-35, specifically, to serve in the drone controller role has potential ramifications beyond the Air Force's CCA program. The Air Force and the Navy have already been working together on systems that will allow for the seamless exchange of control of CCAs and other drones belonging to either service during future operations. The U.S. Marine Corps, which is pursuing its own loyal wingman-type drones currently through experimentation with Kratos XQ-58 Valkyries, also has formal ties to the Air Force's CCA program. All three services fly variants of the Joint Strike Fighter. It's also worth noting here that the U.S. military has been publicly demonstrating the ability of tactical jets to actively control drones in mid-air for nearly a decade now, at least. In 2015, a U.S. Marine Corps AV-8B Harrier jump jet flew notably together with a Kratos Unmanned Tactical Aerial Platform-22 (UTAP-22) drone in testing that included 'command and control through the tactical data link.' Other experimentation is known to have occurred across the U.S. military since then, and this doesn't account for additional work in the classified domain. U.S. allies and partners, a growing number of which are also F-35 operators, may be included in CCA's Increment 2 phase. Many of them have similar drone developments already underway that will require advanced control architectures, too. Commonality in control architectures could have operational benefits, especially during future coalition operations, as well as help accelerate development and spread out cost burdens. Explicit cooperation and collaboration between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia on uncrewed capabilities, including autonomous technologies and related developments, is a notable element of the trilateral AUKUS security partnership. 'Work continues with urgency in 2025, with a particular focus on further integrating drones with the F-22 and F-35 in real-world flight tests to enable rapid testing and learning that can be put into action in the near term,' Lockheed Martin's press release from yesterday adds. 'These capabilities ensure America and its allies stay ahead of ready, equipped with flexible, scalable technologies that rapidly adapt to the evolving demands of future defense operations, securing America’s dominance of the skies.' The F-35, in particular, looks on track to become a particularly important crewed companion for Air Force CCAs, as well as other advanced drones, in the coming years.

Chinese Navy Commissions First Type 054B Frigate	China’s first Type 054B frigate, the Luohe, was commissioned into the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) on Wednesday. The PLAN's newest warship is purportedly bristling with advanced features. Its commissioning follows a Pentagon warning late last year about Beijing’s growing ability to quickly churn out high-end vessels as part of a rapidly expanding fleet with increasing reach across the globe. The ship class, referred to by the U.S. and NATO as the Jiangkai III class, could eventually become the backbone of China’s combat fleet in the future, although Luohe and a second Type 054B are believed to be the only two built thus far. The Luohe was commissioned at the Qingdao Comprehensive Support Base, situated just across the Yellow Sea from South Korea. The ship was launched in 2023 and underwent sea trials last year. While Beijing released few technical details on the vessel, online posts citing the government state that the ship displaces about 5,000 tons. It is also believed to be longer and more capable of future system upgrades than its predecessor, the Type 054A. China's first Type 054B frigate, the Luohe. (X.com) The Type 054B also suggests a stealthier design, with its clean superstructure and overall shaping helping to reduce its radar cross section. In that respect, the warship is similar to the French Aquitaine class frigate, which adopted similar signature-reduction aspects, among many others that have or are adopting similar design traits around the globe to enhance survivability.

Images released online reveal some aspects of Beijing's latest warship, but not necessarily the entirety of Type 054B's innovation. While Luohe and the ships that will follow in the class bear similarities to China's older 054A frigate, this latest frigate is a design that appears to be focused on further reducing reliance on legacy Russian-derived equipment, instead focusing on all indigenous systems, the Australia-based Luck said. While some unknowns exist regarding the Luohe, Luck noted that the sensor array seen in images is entirely new compared to Type 054A. That sensor fit includes a two-sided, rotating electronically scanned array (AESA) primary radar atop the main mast and what appears to be an electronic warfare system extending out of either side of the secondary mast's midpoint. The main and secondary masts of the Chinese Type 054B frigate Luohe. (X.com) 'The ship seems to do away with the dedicated illumination radars for [HQ-16 medium-range surface-to-air missile] guidance, but it's not clear how integration has changed exactly in this regard,' he said. 'It's possible the design uses an improved HQ-16 missile to go with the new sensors, but that's speculative too. Either way, in sensor fit, the ship notably moves away from the Russian tech base used to develop hardware such as the Type 382 and 366 radars and the MR-90 illuminators fitted to Type 054A.' Among other changes between the Luohe and its Type 054A predecessors, the new frigate is fitted with what appears to be an improved version of the H/PJ-87 100mm gun as its main deck gun. Previously, Chinese frigates sported the 76mm as standard fit, although two Type 054 frigates did at one point sport 100mm guns, Luck said. The main gun on China's Type 056B frigate. (X.com) Behind that gun and just in front of the superstructure there is a Type 1130 close-in defense weapon system with an 11-barrel Gatling-type rotary barrel cannon.

(X.com) It also has dual quad box-like missile launchers amidships that fire YJ-83 anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs), Luck said. The propulsion system features two diesel engines, but Luck noted that he originally expected the Type 054B class to feature a gas turbine. Quad launchers aboard China's first Type 054B frigate, the Luohe. (X.com) The frigate boasts a larger hangar than the Type 054A, and can host the Z-20F, a multirole maritime helicopter that mirrors the U.S. Navy’s SH-60 Seahawk. The Z-20 would provide a critical piece to the Type 045B’s anti-submarine warfare (ASW) capabilities, but could also undertake other missions, likely including anti-surface warfare. The latest batch of Type 054As can also accommodate the Z-20, Luck said, 'so this may support the idea that PLAN keeps relying on the 054A for shorter term requirements while they test and improve the Type 054B.'

More advanced types are also in the works as China pushes ahead with unmanned aircraft technologies on all fronts. Luck said the PLAN doesn't appear intent on embarking on a Type 054B building spree just yet, and has noted in his writing how the Luohe and a second frigate are the only ships in the class to be built thus far. 'I think 054B mostly fits the established approach of PLAN when it comes to inducting new combatant designs,' he told TWZ. 'Which means they are quite cautious, initially building a small number to figure out a new design and then either confirm the configuration for mass production or make some changes before they do so. The only notable aberration in that regard was [the Type 055 destroyer], which the builders immediately laid down in numbers.' While the Luohe bears some similarities to the Type 054A, which numbers more than 40 ships of different variants first entering service in 2008, Luck said the new frigate is 'a far more modern design,' and he suspects its true innovations may be lurking belowdecks.

(Paul Hennessy/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) 'Some of the most interesting things about an efficient and modern naval combatant are not very visible from the outside, such as how its command-and-control work, how crew spaces are reconfigured to improve performance including with a possibly smaller crew and so on,' he said. 'I think a few significant changes are on the inside and we have to see more imagery of the ships in service to figure some of these out.' Another big question is cost. If this ship can offer relatively robust capabilities at low cost and build times, it could really help the PLAN's massive fleet expansion initiative. Luohe's debut comes as the U.S. Navy stumbles through its own Constellation class frigate acquisition program, which is at least three years behind schedule. Despite being based on an existing Fregata Europa Multi-Missione (FREMM) parent design, the future warship is suffering 'unplanned weight growth' that could lead to a loss of speed. While the Constellation began having about 85 percent commonality with the parent design, that has plunged roughly 15 percent following Navy design changes, USNI News' Mallory Shelbourne reported in May. While much about the Type 054B is still to be learned, the class is yet another factor in what the U.S. Navy has identified as a huge disparity between Chinese and U.S. capacity to build new naval vessels and total naval force sizes. As The War Zone previously reported, the Office of Naval Intelligence believes Chinese shipbuilders are more than 200 times more capable of producing surface warships and submarines. An Office of Naval Intelligence slide depicting the force laydown for the U.S. and Chinese navies. (U.S. Navy) By most recent estimates, China’s fleet numbers more than 370 vessels, while the U.S. Navy battle force sits at less than 300. This disparity only looks set to grow as China continues its shipbuilding campaign with a huge shipyard capacity advantage over the U.S., and as the U.S. Navy continues to fumble its future shipbuilding agenda against many competing fiscal priorities.

This Is South Korea’s New Heavily Armed Marine Attack Helicopter	South Korea’s locally developed Marine Attack Helicopter (MAH) recently made its first flight and a video now provides us with a much better look at its extensive modifications. With its heavy load of armament carried on relatively huge stub wings, the MAH also stands out for its striking resemblance to the modified Aérospatiale Puma that played the role of the Soviet Mi-24 Hind gunship in the Rambo movie franchise of the 1980s, and that’s not entirely coincidental. 'MAH' takes off for the first time.MAH is a new, dedicated attack helicopter designed for the South Korean Marine Corp.20mm triple barreled chain gun, Taipers missiles, France Mistral, proven platform, latest avionics..that sounds promising.I should call this Korean Hind.It… pic.twitter.com/JPCxDPjJqp&mdash; ハク Mason (@mason_8718) January 22, 2025 The first flight of the Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) MAH was announced last week by the Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA), which manages South Korean defense procurement. However, the milestone event occurred back on December 17, the manufacturer confirmed. KAI added that the first flight lasted around 20 minutes and involved tests of the helicopter’s flight control performance and stability. This included 'taxiing, taking off, and performing hovering, circling, forward/backward/left/right flights, S-shaped circling flights, and maximum horizontal flight at an altitude of approximately 30 meters [100 feet],' KAI said. The prototype MAH. via X (screencap) The most striking features of the MAH relate to its extensive armament, tailored for its missions of amphibious assault, close air support, and coastal defense. A 20mm three-barrel gun is mounted in a turret below the nose (since this is a prototype, the nose also sports a prominent orange-painted boom for test instrumentation). Attached to the sides of the fuselage are stub wings with three weapons hardpoints on each. In the video of the prototype helicopter, these carry — from inboard out — a pair of tube-launched anti-tank guided missiles, a seven-round pod for unguided rockets, and a pair of containerized air-to-air missiles (AAMs). Meanwhile, an electro-optical/infrared turret is fitted at the front of the nose. Stub-wing weapons and missile/laser warning sensors on the prototype MAH. via X (screencap) Previous reports suggest that the missiles carried are Cheongeom ATGMs (up to eight of which can be carried, in four-round clusters), which are locally produced by Hanwha Aerospace, and MBDA Mistral AAMs. However, DAPA has in the past said that it expects the MAH to be armed with locally made AAMs, which would be 'the first time that a domestically developed helicopter has an air-to-air missile capability.' It’s unclear if these plans have now been superseded by integrating the tried-and-tested Mistral, which is also found in the other helicopter-launched applications, as seen in the video below. At least some of the weapons systems on the MAH have already been integrated on the Light Armed Helicopter (LAH-1) Miron, another locally developed rotorcraft, but based on the Airbus H155. The Miron was developed for the Republic of Korea Army (ROKA) and the first examples were delivered to that service late last month.

Photo by JUNG YEON-JE/AFP via Getty Images JUNG YEON-JE Less obvious are other adaptations for the MAH’s combat role, including its extensive self-protection suite, which includes missile warning sensors on the sides of the nose, and laser warning sensors on the sides of the cockpit. On the flight deck, the crew of the MAH is provided with a fully integrated glass cockpit, which includes target acquisition and designation sights (TADS), a stores management computer, helmet-mounted displays, and night-vision goggles capability. Power for the MAH is provided by a pair of General Electric/Hanwha Aerospace T700-701K turboshaft engines each developing 1,855 shaft horsepower, with full-authority digital engine (FADEC) to optimize performance. Published dimensions of the MAH. Korea Aerospace Industries Befitting its maritime role, the MAH is extensively protected against seawater corrosion, is outfitted with flotation devices for emergency landings on water, and has folding main rotor blades to reduce its deck ‘footprint.’ Overall, the up-armed MAH does look reminiscent of the modified Puma that was used in at least two of the Rambo movies, playing the role of the Soviet Mi-24. In fact, that shouldn’t be entirely surprising, as some of the design DNA from the Puma was fed into the South Korean helicopter program early on in its development. The up-armed Puma that was used in Rambo: First Blood Part II, released in 1988. YouTube screencap The MAH is the latest expression of the Korean Utility Helicopter (KUH) program, which was launched back in 2006 as a joint venture involving KAI, Eurocopter (now Airbus), DAPA, and the Korean Aerospace Research Institute. The involvement of Eurocopter saw the KUH take as its conceptual starting point the AS532 Cougar — an evolution of the earlier Puma design. The first helicopter to emerge from this effort was the Surion, which was rolled out in July 2009 and made its first flight in March 2010. The KUH-1 Surion prototype. Korea Aerospace Industries This became Korea’s first domestically designed and produced helicopter, with the KUH-1 Surion being ordered by the Republic of Korea Army (ROKA), primarily to replace its fleet of UH-1H Huey helicopters used for troop lift, search and rescue, and liaison. The KUH-1 entered service in 2012 and also led to a dedicated medical evacuation version, the KUH-1M, with medical equipment, a weather radar, an external winch, and auxiliary fuel tanks.

Flyblackarrow/Wikimedia Commons The KUH-1 was followed by the MUH-1 Marineon for the Republic of Korea Marine Corps (ROKMC), and the KUH-1CG variant for the Korean Coast Guard, while further civil versions have been produced for the National Emergency Management Agency, the Korea Forest Service, and the National Police Agency. The helicopter has also been offered for export, so far without winning any orders. In October 2022, DAPA awarded KAI a $300-million contract to develop the MAH, as an armed version of the MUH-1 Marineon. By the end of last year, KAI had completed production of the first three MAH prototypes and the first ground tests of a prototype began in October 2024. DAPA has said that it expects 2025 to see the MAH undergo full-scale test and evaluation, including many more flight tests, with development planned to be completed in the second half of 2026. Once in service, the MAH will be able to provide powerful fire support and escort for ROKMC Marineon helicopters, including during amphibious assault operations. A rendering showing MAH and MUH-1 helicopters supporting an amphibious assault. Korea Aerospace Industries The ROKMC has only recently begun to re-emerge as an aviation operator within the South Korean military. Although the ROKMC operated light fixed-wing aircraft back in the 1950s, the service was disbanded and its assets were integrated into the ROK Navy (ROKN) in 1973. In 1987, the ROKMC was reestablished but it would not be until 2014 that it was permitted to establish an aviation component. At this point, it was planned to introduce 40 helicopters within three squadrons: two equipped with assault helicopters and one with attack helicopters. To furnish the assault squadrons, 30 MUH-1 Marineon helicopters were ordered, suggesting that the service would eventually get (at least) 10 MAH for its attack squadron. Since then, however, Seoul has placed orders for 24 of the MAH version. A rendering showing MAH helicopters on the deck of an amphibious assault ship. Korea Aerospace Industries The introduction of the MUH-1 Marineon was not entirely smooth. The first two examples were officially inducted by the ROKMC in January 2018, but one of these crashed in July of the same year, after a rotor blade sheared off followed by the detachment of the entire rotor head. This led to a grounding of the entire Surion fleet during which cracks were discovered in the rotor masts of other examples. A thorough inspection was made of all the rotor masts and ROKA KUH-1s had returned to limited flying operations before the end of 2018.

Photo by KIM Jae-Hwan/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images SOPA Images Despite this setback, the Surion program has continued, including the development of the MAH version. As well as adding new helicopters to the ROKMC, South Korea is generally investing more in amphibious warfare as part of a broader expansion of its naval power, which also includes new submarines and heavily armed surface combatants, all part of a more hawkish approach toward North Korea. The two Dokdo class assault ships are the most powerful expressions of these growing amphibious capabilities and will be very suitable hosts for the MAH helicopters once these enter service. Although optimized for attack missions, the MAH also looks to retain its cabin, suggesting that it can also transport troops when required, much like the Mi-24 series. The Marineon can carry up to 11 troops and, even if some of the internal space is lost in the new version, this should ensure the MAH remains a very versatile platform. Next up, the ROK Navy could be set to receive a mine countermeasures version of the Marineon, reflecting the need to defeat North Korea’s extensive mine warfare program. Work on the mine countermeasures Marineon is expected to be completed before the end of 2026. With this in mind, the extensive development path of the South Korean helicopter looks set to continue.

Royal Navy Nuclear Submarine Surfaced Next To Russian Spy Ship To...	The United Kingdom has confirmed that one of its Royal Navy nuclear-powered submarines surfaced close to the Yantar, a notorious Russian spy ship late last year, to make it clear it was being observed. The revelation came as the Royal Navy was once again closely tracking the Russian ship after it returned to British waters. According to the U.K. defense secretary, the Yantar has, in recent months, been 'mapping the U.K.’s critical underwater infrastructure,' at a time when NATO, in general, is increasingly concerned about apparent sabotage to undersea cables. The Yantar was sailing in British waters in November last year, during which time U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey said it had been 'detected loitering over U.K. critical undersea infrastructure.' The Yantar transits through the English Channel during an earlier visit to these waters, in 2018. Crown Copyright LPhot Dan Rosenbaum Interestingly, Healey disclosed that a Royal Navy submarine was among the assets tasked with shadowing the Yantar when it was in British waters back in November. The defense secretary said that warships and patrol aircraft were also involved in tracking the Russian vessel. At one point, the submarine surfaced close to the Yantar 'to make clear that we had been covertly monitoring its every move,' he said. The submarine wasn’t named but will have been one of the five currently active Astute class attack submarines. A Royal Navy Astute class nuclear-powered attack submarine. Crown Copyright www.twz.com The Russian vessel then moved into Irish waters east of Dublin, sparking worries that it might be conducting espionage on critical energy and internet submarine pipelines and cables running between the United Kingdom and Ireland. The spy ship was later escorted out of the Irish Sea. It’s rare for the U.K. government to release any kind of information about the activities of its nuclear-powered submarine fleet, especially regarding such sensitive surveillance missions. In this case, the information was likely made public to dissuade Russia from further espionage directed against critical underwater infrastructure. The tactic may have been effective anyway, with Healey saying that, during its latest venture into British waters, this week, the Yantar didn’t remain on station for any longer period and was closely escorted throughout its journey by the Type 23 frigate HMS Somerset and the River class offshore patrol vessel HMS Tyne. A library image shows three River class patrol vessels, led by HMS Tyne (foreground) exercising off the coast of Cornwall, England. Crown Copyright LA(Phot) Al Macleod According to the Royal Navy, Somerset 'covertly launched her Merlin helicopter, which used its powerful sensors to locate the Russian ship as it made its way north towards the English Channel.' The Type 23 frigate then closed in on the Yantar’s location and intercepted it at the entrance to the Channel, off the French coast. 'Somerset used her cutting-edge radars and sensors to report on every move during the operation, as she maintained a close distance to Yantar through the Channel and the Strait of Dover,' the Navy added. HMS Somerset (foreground) tracks the movements of a Russian spy ship Yantar this week, in waters close to the United Kingdom. Crown Copyright Crown Copyright Tracking the Yantar is not necessarily a difficult job, since its position is typically broadcast at regular intervals using the automatic identification system (AIS), an automatic tracking system that uses transceivers on ships.

HMS Somerset shadows the Russian spy ship Yantar in the English Channel this week. Crown Copyright Royal Navy Healey went on to accuse Russia of threatening European security by targeting undersea infrastructure carrying oil, gas, electricity, and the internet. 'We see you. We know what you’re doing,' he told members of parliament. Healey added that the Yantar was first picked up on Monday when it was 45 miles off the British coast, inside the U.K.’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ).

Officially, the Yantar is a Project 22010 'oceanographic research vessel,' but it has specialized equipment that can reportedly tap or cut submarine cables and investigate and retrieve objects from depths of up to 18,000 feet. It is part of the Russian Defense Ministry fleet, being operated by the Main Directorate Deep-Sea Research, which works on behalf of the Russian Navy, and other agencies. The Yantar was involved in a high-profile operation in 2017 when it sailed off the coast of Syria to recover the wreckage of two fighter jets, a Su-33, and a MiG-29KR, that crashed into the Mediterranean Sea during operations from Russia’s aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov. The following year, 2018, the U.K. Royal Navy again escorted the Yantar through the English Channel as it headed into the North Sea. At this time, it was carrying a Saab SeaEye Tiger deep-sea robot on its deck. Russia acquired this underwater drone after the Kursk submarine disaster. It can reach depths of 3,280 feet. On this occasion, the U.K. Royal Navy sent the Type 45 destroyer HMS Diamond plus a Wildcat helicopter to follow the Russian ship. HMS Diamond (foreground) shadows the Russian spy ship as it passes through the English Channel in 2018.

In the Baltic Sea alone, cables have been damaged on three times occasions, with all of them carrying at least some of the hallmarks of sabotage. In the most prominent event, on December 25, an oil tanker dragging its anchor, damaging a power cable running between Finland and Estonia. This led to NATO launching Baltic Sentry, a mission intended to ensure the security of critical undersea infrastructure in the region. As you can read about here, the mission now also involves Dutch F-35A stealth fighters and it will soon add at least 20 uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) in the coming weeks. This is in addition to surface vessels and maritime patrol aircraft. Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) F-35s flying over the Dutch frigate HNLMS Tromp during the Baltic Sentry mission earlier this week. Dutch Ministry of Defense The vessel responsible for the incident in the Baltic in December was the Eagle S, registered in the Cook Islands, but connected with Russia. The oil tanker was also revealed to be brimming with spy equipment after it was seized by authorities. The suggestion that this incident was connected somehow to the Kremlin was also raised by Healey, who noted that 'many analysts believe this was caused by a vessel in Russia’s shadow fleet.' The potential risk to undersea infrastructure has long been understood, especially bearing in mind how hard it can be to defend it against nefarious action — and the degree to which nations rely on it to fulfill many of their critical needs. 'We are now seeing Russian underwater activity in the vicinity of undersea cables that I don’t believe we have ever seen,' U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Andrew Lennon, then serving as NATO’s top submarine officer, told The Washington Post back in December 2017. 'Russia is clearly taking an interest in NATO and NATO nations’ undersea infrastructure.' Meanwhile, there is now a wide acknowledgment that the Russian war in Ukraine — and the heightened East-West tensions as a result — are driving up the scale of this risk. With that in mind, spy ships like the Yantar are sure to be closely tracked by NATO assets whenever they are found operating in their waters.

More North Korean Artillery Troops Heading To Russia: Ukraine Int...	North Korea is expected to send reinforcements to Russia’s Kursk region, Kyiv’s military intelligence chief told The War Zone exclusively. They will mostly be missile and artillery troops who typically operate the hundreds of tubed and rocket artillery systems as well as the KN-23 short-range ballistic missiles Pyongyang has already provided Moscow, Lt. Gen. Kyrulo Budanov, head of Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR), told us. The artillery is being used to support both North Korean and Russian operations while the missiles are strictly for Russian objectives, he added, noting that the North Koreans will also train Russians on all of those systems. 'We don’t expect to see many new ground combat troops,' he posited. Ukrainian Special Operations Forces posted a video of its troops fighting North Koreans, which you can see in the following video.

The publication did not say how many troops or what kind. The Ukrainian intelligence chief did not know for sure how many new troops would be coming or when they would arrive. So far, about a third of the 12,000 North Koreans sent to Kursk have been killed, leaving about 8,000 to continue the fight, Budanov claimed. Those figures conform with information provided yesterday by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. In contrast, the BBC, citing Western officials, reported that there were 4,000 battle casualties including wounded. About 1,000 were killed, the outlet stated. The War Zone cannot independently verify either tally. A photo shows an alleged North Korean soldier held after being captured by Ukrainian army on January 11, 2025. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the country's military had captured two North Korean soldiers in the Kursk region of Russia, adding that they had survived and were communicating with the Security Service of Ukraine. (Photo by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's Social Media / Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images) Anadolu The new North Korean troops will boost Russia’s long-range fires in both Kursk and Ukraine, Budanov stated. North Korea has provided about 120 170mm M1989 Koksan self-propelled artillery guns and 120 M-1991 240mm multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) to Russia in the last three months, and will likely send at least as many more in the future, Budanov told us. 'They have a lot of these systems,' he added. North Korea has an immense artillery arsenal it has built up over decades for use primarily along the DMZ should a war between North and South erupt. It has exported millions of artillery rounds to Russia, which was in bad need of shells prior to the relationship between the two countries rapidly changing. More Koksans being shipped to Russia. So far I’ve counted around 36 or so guns being photographed which is 2 battalions worth of Koksans. This 1/3rd of what is called a Corps Fire group. A significant addition to the Russian arsenal. KPAWeaponsTracker (@KPAWeapons) January 22, 2025 As we noted in our previous coverage, the Koksans feature a 170mm caliber artillery cannon, mounted in an open superstructure rather than a protected turret atop a chassis similar in appearance to that used on Russia’s 2S7 Pion, a 203mm self-propelled artillery piece. The M1989 version also has onboard storage for 12 rounds of ammunition. The weapon’s main advantage is its long range, with the big 170mm gun assessed as capable of firing a standard shell to a range of around 25 miles, or a rocket-assisted shell to a range of 37 miles. The M-1991s have 22 tubes aligned in two rows of eight and one row of six, according to the U.S. Army. They have high explosive, smoke, incendiary, and chemical warhead capabilities within 200-pound warheads. These rockets also have a maximum range of about 37 miles. Most of these weapons are either being used against troops in Ukraine or for training in Russia, Budanov noted. 'The 170mm weapons have powerful ammunition and good capability,' Budanov pointed out. 'The 240mm MLRS are like any other heavy systems. They make more problems on the front line.' M-1991 240mm multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) like these on parade in Pyongyang, have been sent to Russia, according to Ukrainian intelligence. (KCNA) In addition to the artillery, Pyongyang is expected to send 150 more KN-23 short-range ballistic missiles to Moscow in 2025, said Budnov, adding that there were 148 sent last year. North Korean troops are firing those weapons from both the Kursk and Bryansk regions and will continue to instruct Russians, who are now firing them as well, Budanov stated. Those missiles, as we previously reported, were first launched against Ukraine in January 2024, according to a Biden administration assessment at the time, with questionable results. Russia has obtained the North Korean KN-23 short-range ballistic missile seen here. (North Korean State Media) North Korean troops and weapons are adding to the challenges Ukraine faces both in Kursk and at home. In Kursk, they are being used in so-called meat wave assaults, attacking in large numbers with little armor support, according to The New York Times. Though differences in language and doctrine reduce their effectiveness, the sheer numbers of North Korean troops have forced Ukraine to expend munitions and defend positions they might have had to otherwise. On the Ukrainian front, North Koreans use unusual tactics: they move in groups of 40 or more men under heavy fire and across fields littered with mines. They do not stop during attacks. If they capture a position, they leave it to the Russians and prepare for a new assault.The… pic.twitter.com/yEtybqlgTr&mdash; Anton Gerashchenko (@Gerashchenko_en) January 22, 2025 Budanov, however, is not impressed with their capabilities. 'They are like biological robots,' he dismissed. Despite fierce efforts by Russia and its North Korean allies to dislodge them, Ukraine still holds onto its Kursk salient. Meanwhile, Russia continues to slowly chew up ground in the eastern part of Ukraine, especially near the key logistical hub of Pokrosk.

That’s a questionable timeline especially given both Russian and Ukrainian objections to publicly floated details from a plan co-written by Kellogg and published by the pro-Trump America First Policy Institute. It calls for a delay in Ukraine joining NATO, freezing the front lines where they are, and suggests that the U.S. will boost its aid to Ukraine if Russia does not comply while it will cut off aid if Ukraine does not. However, despite pledges he could quickly end this conflict, Trump has yet to release his peace plan. Putin signaled that he was in no rush to settle the war in Ukraine, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. The goal of any coming talks 'should not be a brief truce, not some kind of respite for the regrouping of forces and rearmament with a view to a subsequent continuation of the conflict, but a long-term peace based on respect for the legitimate interests of all people, all peoples who live in the region,' Putin said in a video released by the Kremlin this week, the publication noted.

Giving the Raptors an IRST capability, something that has been in the works for years now, will offer the jets a valuable new way to spot and track aerial threats, especially stealthy ones, and do so passively and in a way immune to electronic warfare. Lockheed Martin, which is also the primary contractor for the F-22, provided new details about the TacIRST-based Infrared Defensive System (IRDS) for the Raptor in a press release today. TacIRST was unveiled in 2022 and its first known integration was into the noses of F-5 Advanced Tiger aggressor jets belonging to private contractor Tactical Air Support (TacAir). At least one podded configuration with multiple TacIRST sensors has been observed as part of the development of the system.

Lockheed Martin A podded version of Lockheed Martin's TacIRST system. Lockheed Martin via USPTO 'The F-22 will soon feature a newly developed, distributed set of embedded TacIRST sensors developed by Lockheed Martin to enhance aircraft survivability and lethality, known as the Infrared Defensive System (IRDS),' according to the release. 'In addition to managing integration of IRDS on the F-22, the company will also support integration on other platforms.' How many total sensors and what other components the complete IRDS consists of are unclear. TacIRST by itself is a compact staring-type system with a fixed field of view, so a distributed array of them would be required to provide broader coverage around the F-22. Historically, both integrated and podded IRSTs have featured larger aperture sensors in gimbal mounts with flexible fields of view. It's also not clear how exactly IRDS will be added to the F-22. The description in the press release of IRDS being 'embedded' in the Raptor would seem to point to it being directly integrated into the aircraft's core structure. At the same time, Raptors have been seen flying with stealthy underwing pods widely understood to be part of plans to add IRST capability to the jet. Those same pods have also been seen carried by sensor testbed aircraft. A F-22 seen with the stealthy underwing pods in 2022. James Reeder Pictures that emerged just last week, seen in the social media post below, notably showed one of the pods with a small slit aperture at the front, which would be more in line with the TacIRST sensor, instead of the larger faceted window that has been seen in the past. Pods with the larger window could accommodate a more traditional IRST sensor. The pods might be part of the complete IRDS package, or be capable of being linked to it to provide additional IRST coverage and/or other capabilities, though we don't know if that is the case at this time. Having the embedded IRST as well as the ability to mount a larger IRST sensor in the pod under the wing could be beneficial or the trajectory of the F-22's IRST program may have changed, with TacIRST being selected as a solution instead of a more traditional singular podded system.

The Joint Strike Fighters also feature a Distributed Aperture System (DAS) made up of an array of cameras around the aircraft that provide threat warning and other functionality. The F-22 does have its own AN/AAR-56 Missile Launch Detector (MLD) system that provides spherical infrared threat warning, and that could potentially be supplanted by the IRDS, with the system providing IRST and MLD functions. Getting TacIRST sensors and hardware into the apertures that exist for the F-22's MLD system may be a challenge. If this is possible, it could provide the F-22 with an even larger situational awareness and sensor upgrade. Regardless, capabilities found on modular DAS-like setups that are less proprietary compared to one used on the F-35 have shown the ability to provide multi-functional capabilities. TWZ has reached out to Lockheed Martin for more details about IRSD and how it will be integrated onto the F-22. It's also worth noting that IRSTs, in general, are typically only able to instantaneously determine a target's angle and bearing, and track it, with it taking more effort to determine its range using just a single sensor platform. Two IRST sensors on separate aircraft that are networked together can instantly triangulate the target's range, which can then provide more robust engagement-quality target tracks. Lockheed Martin has demonstrated this kind of networked IRST capability in combination with its Legion Pod in the past and it is a common practice for aircraft equipped with advanced IRST capabilities. The IRST21 sensor used on the Legion Pod, as well as in other podded configurations, is a more traditional gimbaled type, as you can read more about here. An abstract graphical depiction of two podded IRST sensors working networked together. Lockheed Martin Regardless, adding IRST capability to the F-22 would be a major boon for the jets, especially amid a growing number of potential stealthy aerial opponents. IRSTs 'see' targets over long distances in the infrared spectrum regardless of any features intended to reduce their radar cross sections. As already noted, they also have the benefit of working passively, meaning that they do not put out signals that could alert an enemy to the fact that they have been detected and are being tracked. This makes them immune to electronic warfare, another ever-growing threat, as well. In addition, while IRSTs then offer advantages over traditional radars, especially in environments with heavy electronic warfare activity, they can complement each other greatly. IRSTs can cue radars and vice versa, and fused data from both, as well as passive radio frequency sensors, can produce even higher-quality target tracks, as well as just provide better overall situational awareness and enhanced positive target identification. IRSTs are in use elsewhere globally, including among potential adversaries like China and Russia, which presents its own threats. China's recently emerged heavy stealth fighter concept, currently referred to colloquially as the J-36, appears to feature a very elaborate and potentially long-range IRST capability. The F-22 Raptor was originally supposed to feature an integrated IRST system, but those plans were dropped ostensibly for budgetary reasons relatively deep into its development. From the information available now, the Air Force began to re-explore the idea of adding an IRST capability onto the Raptors more actively in the late 2010s-early 2020s timeframe. The service's 2025 Fiscal Year budget request mentions active work on an 'advanced Infrared Search and Track sensor' as part of a 'sensor enhancement' effort for the jets since at least 2023. A rendering shared by now-retired Air Force Gen. Mark Kelly, then head of Air Combat Command, in 2022, showing modernized F-22s with stealthy underwing pods and drop tanks. The jet in the foreground is also seen firing a still unidentified missile. Via Gen. Mark Kelly 'We understand the need for advanced and versatile infrared systems like IRDS that will make pilots' missions more survivable and lethal against current and future adversaries,' Hank Tucker, Vice President of Missions Systems at Lockheed Martin, said in a statement today. 'We're committed to supporting the Air Force through continuous innovation of capabilities to deter and defeat evolving threats.' Broader plans to add new and improved capabilities for the F-22s, including stealthy range-extending drop tanks, now come amid significant uncertainty about the future of plans for sixth-generation stealth combat jet as part of the Air Force's Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative. That aircraft was originally envisioned as a successor to the Raptor, but a deep review of those requirements was initiated last year and the Trump administration now has to make a final decision about how to proceed. The service currently has no publicly announced timeline for retiring the Raptors, which remain the most capable fighters in U.S. inventory today. Ongoing F-22 modernization efforts had also been feeding into the NGAD effort, and the reverse is true too, which you can read more about here. Lockheed Martin's press release today about IRDS does mention the potential 'integration on other platforms,' though it offers no further details. If nothing else, the F-22 looks to getting ever-closer to getting a long-promised and increasingly critical IRST capability.

We Went To Mock War With Marine F-35Bs On A Pacific Island	On Dec. 8th, 2024, four F-35Bs from VMFA-214 'Black Sheep' squadron, along with two F-35Bs from VMX-1, flew out of Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Yuma in Arizona accompanied by two Air Force C-17s from the 97th Airlift Squadron. The destination was an airfield on San Clemente Island (SCI), a U.S. military-controlled outpost used for training, test, and weapons development, located roughly 65 miles off the San Diego coast. Before the C-17s landed, VMFA-214's F-35Bs faced a host of ‘red air’ adversaries, including 5th generation fighters, before the C-17s could safely ingress. In other words, they would have to fight their way in. From this airfield, the Black Sheep and VMX-1 would test a host of new tactics, techniques and procedures while refining others, before fighting their way out on the way back to MCAS Yuma. The Marines would be stationed as they would in a conflict, living in tents and eating Meals Ready to Eat (MREs), while living and operating from SCI. The War Zone was invited to get an exclusive look at how these squadrons operated and maintained the F-35B out of an austere environment while generating combat sorties. It was an unprecedented and exclusive peek into the USMC's evolving Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations (EABO) playbook and what a real fight in the Pacific with the USMC’s most advanced fighter aircraft could actually look like. Fighting Their Way In The War Zone sat down with VMFA-214 Commanding Officer Lt. Col. Robert 'Champ' Guyette to discuss the melding of USAF heavy transport capabilities and Marine tactical airpower in a forward deployed scenario from an island with minimal support and highly contested logistics. 'It's somewhat non-standard for Marine tactical aviation to work this closely with the C-17, but we have a great relationship with the reserve unit, the 97th, the ‘Fightin Roos’ out of Joint Base Lewis-McChord up in Washington. It started about a year and a half ago. We've got some Marines that used to fly with us that are now reservists with the 97th. And so that's how the relationship started,' Guyette explained. 'We started doing detachments out of New Orleans and other places like that to achieve mutual training objectives. There's a lot of things that we can't do that they can do and vice-versa, so it's a symbiotic relationship between the two of us.' In the cockpit of the C-17 as they fly at very low-level to SCI, with F-35Bs providing escort and fending off red air adversaries. (Author) 'From the Marine perspective, the C-17 represents tactical fixed-wing heavy lift, which we always welcome in expeditionary mission planning cells. They routinely practice things like high-speed, low-level ingress and egress, and they can carry a ton of stuff. We are employing it to insert my entire Marine Corps team on the objective – all the weapons I would need and the tactical refueling and ground refueling systems to fight and sustain ourselves inside the WEZ [enemy’s weapons engagement zone], all in one C-17. Whatever fuel that they don't need to get home, we can download that fuel from the C-17 into our fuel bladders to fill fighters,' the squadron commander said. 'We set up the base, dump the gas out of the C-17, and then defend it so they can scoot. Once the bladders are filled with C-17 gas, MWSS (Marine Wing Support Squadron) Marines can fill up the F-35s when they cycle down from the overhead CAP (combat air patrol) and really minimize the time we are on deck. Properly configured C-17 and F-35 units make a strong expeditionary fighting team, and we're really lucky to have those partners in the 97th.' C-17 landing at San Clemente Island with Marine F-35 support crews, weapons, and materiel. (Author) The F-35B and C-17A have more in common than one might think. Each aircraft was designed to operate from remote locales. The design of the C-17 with high-lift wings, slats, powerful engines, and externally blown flaps, allows it to take off and land on runways as short as 3,500 feet. The runways need to be only about 90 feet wide because the aircraft can turn around using a three-point star turn. It also had a unique backing-up capability using thrust reversers, which was demonstrated on the island during the exercise. Maximum payload capacity of the C-17 is 170,000 pounds, and it has space for 18 pallet positions that makes it ideal to help carry the equipment needed for EABO. C-17A loaded with forward refueling equipment about to head on its way to San Clemente Island. (Author) All F-35Bs took off and landed in the Short Take Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) mode during the exercise. Short takeoffs can lead to issues because, if not done properly, pieces of the runway can break apart and get ingested into the engine or strike the aircraft and nearby assets. Mitigating foreign object debris (FOD) on takeoff, pilots demonstrated the short takeoff (STO) capability of the F-35B, launching their combat-loaded 5th generation fighters from simulated short and narrow runways in less than 1,000 feet using temporary markers on SCI's main airfield. F-35B launching in STOVL mode on SCI. (Author) Naval Auxiliary Landing Field San Clemente Island was the perfect place to set EABO for this exercise. The main runway sits at the northern tip of the island with the Pacific at both east and west ends, providing a fairly austere environment for training objectives that would simulate what the Marines could face much farther out into the Pacific. For 48 hours, the three flying squadrons along with MWSS-371 would establish an EABO node in support of the larger 3rd Marine Air Wing exercise known as Steel Knight 24. The event is the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force’s (I MEF) annual large-scale exercise, which is seen as the final major training event for the 1st Marine Regiment before they deploy as part of Marine Rotational Force Darwin in Australia. F-35Bs depart SCI in STOL mode. (Author) Previous Steel Knight exercises, which have become increasingly challenging and realistic, as well as this one, act as an operation that the MEF and 3rd MAW use to develop and validate their concept of operations in the Pacific. For VMFA-214 on SCI, objectives included enhancing squadron proficiency, Training and Readiness (T&R) progression to prepare for deployment, and exercising the planning, coordination, and logistics required to establish an EABO-representative node in a contested environment. The USAF C-17 and Marine F-35 team took centerstage for the exercise. (Author) Guyette summed up the mission as 'Fight in, fight from, fight out. It's a three phase-approach that we're rehearsing this week. We believe that in the next fight, we're going to have to fight to get to anywhere we go, and the enemy is going to try to hassle us on the way in. Once we get there, we're going to have to protect ourselves, and we're going to minimize our time in any one place. We're going to have to be able to strike from that place and then pack up and then fight our way back out. And so day one of this exercise was an opposed escort of C-17s from Yuma into San Clemente Island. We had four Black Sheep F-35Bs, and two from VMX-1 — the operational test unit in Yuma, and we were up against a large number of what we call red air, or adversary aircraft. We sourced the red air from Marine F/A-18s, F-35s and contract red air from companies like ATAC flying F-21 Kfirs and Hawker Hunters with special mission pods on them. They were simulating a coordinated enemy, trying to protect the island and prevent us from getting the C-17s on there. Marine F-35Bs escorting USAF C-17s into SCI. (Author) 'With some tanking support, we got the band together airborne and executed an offensive counter air (OCA) sweep mission to punch a big hole in that red air picture. Then we got those C-17s ingressed into San Clemente Island, carrying my Black Sheep maintenance team and all of our ordnance, as well as the MWSS-371 Sand Shark Marines and their Tactical Air Ground Refueling System (TAGRS). Once on deck, the Sand Sharks offloaded the gas out of the C-17s and into the TAGRS bladders. While they're setting that up on the ground, the F-35s overhead shifted to a defensive counter air (DCA) mission to protect the island, as the red air reconstituted for another re-attack. This scenario was modeled after similar &#8230; situations we'd see in the real world — the enemy would be made aware that we are there and would not just cede the island, so we'd have to put them in their place again while the Marines below us set up that position. And so, a red air strike package approached, we defended the island, and then recovered the four Black Sheep and two VMX-1 jets for the night.' MRZR towing TARS. (Author) After two C-17s conducted their low-level approach to the island with F-35B cover, they quickly unloaded MWSS Marines and cargo with the help of experienced loadmasters. Three Marine Polaris MRZR all-terrain vehicles towed two TAGRS and several 3,000-gallon fuel bladders off the aircraft and were set up alongside the C-17 within minutes. The other C-17 offloaded maintenance Marines and ordnance, which included several GBU-53 Bravos, also known as Small Diameter Bomb IIs (GBU-53/B, and several AIM-120 air-to-air missiles. Marine F-35Bs can carry eight GBU-53/Bs internally, as well as a pair of AIM-120 AMRAAMs, maintaining their low observable signature. The GBU-53/B can glide for dozens of miles to its target, which can be static or moving, striking with extreme precision and a powerful blast that can even piece some fortified structures. GBU-53/Bs and AIM-120s get unloaded and readied for loading onto F-35Bs. (Author) MWSS-371, which is responsible for providing all essential aviation ground support requirements to the expeditionary group, put the new TAGRS to use. The TAGRS includes all of the refueling components in one compact system allowing for rapid setup and breakdown. This makes it near-essential for EABO operations, which seeks to distribute lethality across a large battlespace, especially to austere locales. The MRZR/TAGRS combination is perfect for expeditionary fuel operations since they can fit in both MV-22s and CH-53s. MWSS-371 recently employed this system during a recent Weapons and Tactics Instructor Course (WTI) and reduced expeditionary F-35B refueling time by 90% over previous capabilities and concepts of operations. Marines about to transfer fuel from the C-17 to large bladders. (Author) The planning cell for the exercise was unique in that it included pilots and loadmasters from all three weapons schools including graduates from Marine WTI training in Yuma, the USAF Weapons School in Nellis, and the Navy’s Fighter Weapon School (Topgun) in Fallon. One of the planners on the C-17 side for the exercise was Maj. Matt 'Leaker' Walton. Walton has been flying the C-17 since 2009 with more than 4,000 flying hours and is a graduate of the USAF Weapons School. 'Exercise opportunities with units like VMFA-214 and MWSS-371 are critical to the continued development of C-17 training because it allows us to see how to best support our joint partners like those of I MEF,' Walton stated. 'The C-17 plays a significant role in the joint maneuver force, especially in the INDOPACOM theater, so these opportunities have an operational level impact by building relationships at the tactical level. Further, this opportunity represents the first step in synchronizing the parallel joint efforts of Expeditionary Advanced Basing Operations (EABO), Agile Combat Employment (ACE), and the Army’s Multi-Domain Task Force (MDTF) to address challenges like anti-access area denial (A2/AD).' C-17 on the ground at San Clemente Island taxiing to the apron. (Author) Asked about how the school prepared him for this unique training event, Walton told us, 'The USAF Weapons School is a problem-solving course I think thinly disguised as a mission planning course. It teaches you how to solve difficult problems and build a team to do it. I think what we did with the VMFA-214 is a perfect example. I don't speak all of the same language as the Marines, but when you have a singular purpose with another unit it allows you to sit across the table from each other, look each other in the eyes and figure out ‘what do I need to support you. What do you need to support me?’ And it allows you to build very complex integrated plans in a systematic way.' 'I don't know the correct way to say this but every one of the weapons school communities has a different flavor. Topgun and WTI certainly have their own flavor and they're different from each other. The Air Force is very, very heavy on mission planning and integration. I think mission planning and kind of like deliberate strategic long-range planning is an Air Force strength. And so I think that is a large focus of Weapons School, how to build a complex thing piece-by-piece,' Walton added. The C-17 dropped off 80,000-pounds of fuel at the Marines' temporary home on SCI, providing enough gas for a few days of air operations, but integrating the C-17 into complex mission planning was difficult. The aircraft lacks a Link-16 networking capability, which provides challenges to the F-35s as they provide escort. Without a viable datalink that can connect with the F-35s, C-17 crews are forced to use other methods to stay on task. 'We are literally using a piece of paper and a pencil with a bullseye chart and tracking where we are and where red air is based on specific criteria in order to maintain the risk that we are set to. Most of the defense of the C-17 is accomplished in the mission planning cell where we produce contracts that VMFA-214 have to execute in order to keep us safe. We are highly dependent on our escort or the tactical command and control function as we listen to radios and use paper. It is hard to do and requires a high level of aircrew training.' 'Flying low-level is a very important self defense capability for the C-17. It is something we train to on almost every sortie. We can fly down to 300-feet AGL (above ground level) and did that for most of the mission both in and out. While it makes it harder for red air to target us, it also makes it harder for blue air to track us, which is why the mission planning and mutual trust is so important.' Taking The Fight To The Enemy Day two on the island saw VMFA-214 awakening out of their tents to begin executing a long-range strike against a simulated surface target. Capt. Christopher 'Mellen' Streicher serves as the operations officer at VMFA-214, having previously served in VMFA-211 where he deployed on the HMS Queen Elizabeth. Capt. Christopher 'Mellen' Streicher, operations officer for the Black Sheep. (Author) Stryker told us about day two, stating, 'We flew a division [four aircraft] of F-35Bs off San Clemente and hooked up with some F-15E Strike Eagles in the lane along with some F/A-18s from VMFA-232 executing a maritime strike on an enemy combatant in the Whiskey 291 (training range area). They had to fight back the red air picture which was trying to prevent them from reaching that asset, and they had to locate that asset which is challenging. As F-35 pilots, we continuously train to locate challenging targets with both active and passive techniques. More importantly is how you pass on that information to an asset that has weapons that can attrite that threat.' VMX-1 F-35Bs readying for a sortie on SCI. (Author) 'It is critical to integrate with our F/A-18s. In the air-to-air arena, the Hornets have six medium range missiles and two AIM-9Xs so they carry more weapons than we do. The challenge becomes ‘how do I use those weapons efficiently and effectively and get the Hornets into a spot where they can employ their strengths?’ Maybe the answer is ‘I use my sensors to help them find targets … so we find and locate the target, and then fight the air-to-air fight while we pass the targeting info to the Hornets that can go fire a weapon to destroy that target.’ The data passage piece is not that complicated, but it is the one that takes the most planning, so things go smoothly.' F-35B in STOVL mode on the runway. (Author) Guyette elaborated, telling us, 'So that's the whole trick of it, to use the different strengths of each aircraft together as a team in order to accomplish a challenging objective. The key to building a winning plan is understanding each other's systems and then having long discussions about what each other needs to accomplish the mission. We call that process F2T2EA: find, fix, target, track, engage, and assess. We need to find the target and we need to fix it, or make sure that we understand very precisely where it is. We will then target and then track it as it's moving. In this case, a ship moving through the ocean. We will then engage it as a team, and then we will assess the effects of our engagement. In each one of those steps, different players come into the forefront, with different contracts between teammates and different systems and capabilities that are the focus. At the end of the day it's the crews — men and women, Marines, airmen and sailors — working together to use the systems and their training and their airplanes to complete that kill chain.' F-35B transitions from STOVL mode. (Author) 'On day two, we used Marine F-35Bs, Air Force F-15Es, and Marine F/A-18s, as well as some other special mission systems to get that done. On this mission the target wasn't an actual warship, it was a contracted barge with a system that simulates the signatures of a threat surface combatant. Team F-35 finds it, then fixes it using techniques to reduce the uncertainty area. Then the Hornet steps into the spotlight, as F-35s use datalinks to pass targeting information to the F/A-18s, with multiple briefed backup plans when Murphy inevitably shows up and the plan goes sideways. We use a very talented and experienced white cell to inject that kind of friction, testing blue air adaptability and flexibility by simulating chaotic event patterns many of us have witnessed in combat.' Once the target was located, F/A-18s simulated an attack with their AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles, while F-35s and F-15Es provided protection against the rapidly regenerating red air threat. With the target destroyed, F-35s covered the egress of the F/A-18s and then returned to SCI for a quick refuel and rearm, postured to scramble to defend their island outpost while pilots planned the next offensive action. Marines generating sorties from their temporary island outpost. (Author) Current plans have the Marine Corps retiring F/A-18C/Ds around 2030, but they will spend their last years getting some very important upgrades as they continue to fly along with F-35s. Those upgrades include new APG-79(V)4 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars and improved electronic warfare suites. On the weapons side of the house, Marines are busy integrating the AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) cruise missile. The introduction of the JASSM to the legacy Hornets will provide a huge capability over current weapons in terms of reach, which will allow the aircraft to be more survivable as they attempt to stay out of the range of enemy air defenses. With no current aircraft in the USMC inventory capable of carrying the JASSM, integrating JASSM into the Hornet will provide some time until both Marine F-35Bs and Cs receive new stand-off strike weapons. The Fight Out On the final day at SCI, Marines quickly packed up their gear and awaited the arrival of the C-17s that took off from MCAS Yuma. With the C-17s on deck, Marines quickly loaded their equipment and themselves leaving only the F-35Bs with their pilots on deck in running aircraft. The last people of the aircraft were the crew chiefs that were carrying the chocks for the F-35s. C-17s and F-35Bs taxi at SCI. (Author) C-17s departed with F-35Bs just a few minutes behind. One of the F-35B pilots on the last mission was Maj. Mike 'Harvey' Savage. C-17s incorporated one of their unique abilities into the final mission, which was a maritime resupply of a notional submarine. Savage told us, 'The mission planning day was a little non-standard because due to operating off the island, we had to do the mission planning day three days prior to execution. This presents a myriad of challenges because the mission was not fresh in people’s minds. We’d been sleeping in tents for two nights. The day includes executing the mission planning cell, which includes a structure of meetings. It was also a rep for one of the pilots as a workup event for the pilot to get his Mission Commander Under Instruction, which is a prerequisite for the pilot to attend the next WTI in the spring. It was a 12-hour day.' Briefing onboard the C-17. (Author) 'For the mission we executed short takeoffs as a four ship after waiting for the wake turbulence of the C-17s to subside. We executed a pre-mission hit to top off our gas and got in the escort mindset to get the C-17s to a release point to where the C-17s could provide an aerial replenishment to a nuclear submarine. We joined up with five other F-35s from Yuma for a total of nine plus four F/A-18s. We went up against four F-35Cs, two Kfirs, two Learjets and four Hawker Hunters. It was a robust red air picture. We gave the C-17s a hard time on target to make it more difficult for mission planning. We attempted to set conditions to enable the C-17s to get to the release pilot without getting shot down. The C-17 is a strategic target so we provided escort. It was great having F-35Cs on the opposing side because it shows you what the threat is we’re going up against. The Learjets had jamming pods which made it more difficult and added a layer of complexity. Once the C-17s were in an acceptable level of risk to complete their mission, they went in.' Low level door drop operations aboard the C-17. (Author) Embracing The Digital Battlespace While On The Move Another unique part of the exercise on SCI was the testing of the Maritime Targeting Cell - Expeditionary (MTC-X), also known as MENACE. Designed specifically for use in missions that require great mobility, the system is an upgrade of the MTC-A (Maritime Targeting Cell - Afloat), which gathers information from sensors and sends it to communication nodes based on land and at sea, in a secure way. One of the ideas behind the system is to help reduce the sensor-to-shooter time by accurately directing long-range fire from weapons such as the Navy-Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System, also known as the NMESIS weapons system. The NMESIS fires Naval Strike Missiles, capable of hitting targets 115 miles away. For this exercise, the system was brought on to SCI by a Marine KC-130J from VMGR-352. It is also capable of being slingloaded beneath a CH-53. The MTC-X is vital to getting the most out of all the F-35 has to offer in the forward battlespace. Col. John 'Ike' Dirk serves as the commanding officer of VMX-1, who flew out to SCI on a CH-53K to get a firsthand look at MENACE in an expeditionary environment. He told us, 'MENACE is kind of a forward edge deployable communications node and planning facility with connectivity. We at VMX-1 are doing an evaluation on it. There are a lot of different systems in the space. It has some on-board power capability. As good at the F-35 is, we must have near real-time communications, otherwise, as latency builds up — whatever the data we have is only as good as our last communications hit. If we are going to be spread out doing stuff like we like to do in the Marine Corps, then we need to have the ability to be connected in that environment. Menace is one of the things we are evaluating to help facilitate that. MENACE seen on the ramp at SCI. (Author) 'The key thing is that it is organically transportable by the Marines Corps. As important and reliant as we are on the joint force, we can’t be completely dependent on external logistical support to move around our key pieces of equipment. The system doesn’t need a power source and can actually provide power to other systems like a COC (Combat Operations Center).' Dirk continues, 'One of the great things about the F-35 is that we have gotten out of the business of doing time-based maintenance where we wait for a piece to fail. We do a lot of conditions-based maintenance and some of that is done algorithmically, calculated in the airplane when it might be time to change out a part. In order to do that you need connectivity with either stuff you have with you, like MENACE, or where you can reach back to the enterprise and say, 'hey these are the parts that I am going to need to replace soon and here are the ones we need to order because I want to replace them because of what they went through in their lifespan.' Being able to be connected not only enables the tactical part but enables the logistical past for not only the F-35 but for all of our systems.' The EABO exercise was a mix of an extremely low-tech and very high-tech simulated combat environment. (Author) Talking about MTC-X, Guyette added, 'The Marine Corps and the Marine Corps War Fighting Lab is pushing this really hard, because we've realized that part of being able to do EABO is to be able to push data back and forth in a denied, degraded, intermittent and latent data environment. In places where it's hard to get a cellular signal, or it's hard to get connection to overhead assets to generate data back and forth, data isolation can be a showstopper for anybody that's trying to do this kind of thing. Expeditionary command and control and expeditionary data are key enablers to our way of fighting, and so the Marine Corps is currently investigating multiple solutions to that problem. 'What we've got out here today is one solution from a vendor that allows us to use unclassified and classified networks, both over voice and data, in order to support our maintenance effort and support mission planning, mission briefing, mission execution from a command and control perspective, and debriefing as well. The maintainer is pushing data back from a node to a hub or a spoke, so that back home, where we do have those resources, they can prepare and order parts from farther back in the supply chain. When the jet finally makes it back to that echelon, it’s maintained proactively instead of reactively.' Generating 5th generation fighter sorties from an island with minimal support presents an array of old and new challenges. (Author) Guyette added, 'Robust expeditionary C3I allows my intelligence Marines to provide crews with real-time situation updates prior to launch, and the pilots can take that information and modify the software in the airplane to customize our lethality based on the current threat. They can also use this equipment to coordinate mission briefs with disparate assets, which is something we did here on the island. So, Air Force units that are not located with us, other Marine units that are on the ship or on other bases, overhead Space Force assets, and our Ground Combat Element Marine brothers and sisters on the ground, coordinating all that stuff and secure comms, and then going out and executing it, managing the battle space via a C2 (command and control) node &#8230; and then coming home and doing it all over again.' Living In The Expeditionary Environment A few years back when he was the commanding general of the 3rd Marine Air Wing, Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps Gen. Christopher J. Mahoney was speaking to The War Zone about Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations. He told us, 'In the Marine Corps, if I want a new idea, I read an old book. The EABO concept is about moving around, establishing a capability, sustaining that capability, and then moving again before you become a seductive target to somebody. That is what we’re moving toward with EABO.' GBU-53/Bs about to be loaded onto an F-35B with one of the C-17s that supported the mission in the background. (Author) 'If you look at Operation Cartwheel in World War II, up in the Solomon Islands, and how we executed particularly aviation operations in Korea, that’s what we did. MAG-12 [Marine Air Group 12] moved across several airfields and moved around depending on where the fight was, picked up their trash, moved around, got in battery, and started generating combat power or moved back onto the ship and then moved back ashore. So, those ideas and those capabilities are things we’ve got historical experience with. Now it’s a matter of reintroducing them intellectually, and then making the structure follow the concept and thoughts, and then training to the functions that we want to perform,' he added. One of the squadrons that was a big part of those operations in the Solomon Islands that Mahoney was referring to was the Black Sheep, known as VMF-214 at the time. During the late 1943 island-hopping campaign up the Solomons, Maj. Gregory 'Pappy' Boyington led VMF-214 as they flew out of bases so far forward that they were often behind Japanese lines, and even operating out of an airfield on an island that still had enemy positions on it. The squadron was made up of some of the most experienced pilots in the Pacific and scored dozens of kills in a few short weeks with nine of the 28 pilots becoming aces. A simulated scramble at Turtle Bay on September 11, 1943 with the Black Sheep's F4U-1s in the background. (National Archives) Now the Marines of the Black Sheep squadron are at it again, training in austere environments as they prepare for a possible confrontation in the Pacific. Watching the Marines on their final day on the island packing up their tents and gear behind a ramp dotted with 5th generation F-35s, one could only think of the photos from the Solomon Islands where 'Boyingtons Bastards' were seen operating in much the same way living next to their F-4U Corsairs. Guyette summed up the experience of the exercise saying, 'If my Marines can wake up in a tent, hygiene, shave their face successfully, go out and work on an airplane, and then come back to their bivouac and be comfortable being uncomfortable, and then pack their trash quickly, get in a C-17, and then get out and do it all over again, that's success for me this week. The high speed, whiz-bang, gee-whiz stuff will come with time. Our pilots are capable of amazing things, but the thing that I personally as a commander really focused on is my corporals and my sergeants. I asked them to shift their mindset from a hangar or a ship, where we have everything we could ever want, into this kind of field environment where they're aggressively conserving materials and doing without a lot of creature comforts that we normally have. And I think that's kind of the best part of this job for me as a CO now, is watching the Marines effortlessly do that and be excited to do it because they know it’s realistic. It's built into them as Marines, and they continue to amaze me after 20 years of watching them.' Marines of all ranks called small tents home during their stay on SCI. (Author) 'They know we’re not going to have hangars. We're not going to have all of our nice equipment like at home. It'll be compromised, destroyed, or we're going to have to move away from it when the time comes. And so the question you ask yourself is, can we really make that happen when the fight comes to us? Could we actually do that? What you're seeing during this exercise is that the things that make us Marines are the things that are going to help us win.' Guyette elaborated further, 'We must continue to train like this. Marines know it and honestly they don't care about creature comforts because they just want to fight and win. You know, if we give them an MRE and a bottle of water and maybe someplace to sleep out of the rain, they will just continue to smash the enemy into the dirt, repeatedly. I couldn't be more proud of them and proud to be on the team with them. They just get it done, and it doesn't matter where they are or what the situation is – if they’re together, they're going to find a way to win. The Black Sheep, the Sand Sharks, and the VMX-1 Marines … they've all demonstrated that the strength of the individual Marine is what will carry the day.' All of the squadrons that participated showed an extraordinary ability to get maintenance done with far fewer tools and equipment than they would normally have at MCAS Yuma. During the visit, we saw only one aircraft go down for some unexpected maintenance that required a few hours before it was back flying. 'We say in the Black Sheep, slow is smooth, smooth is fast. And so, we don't hand out qualifications because somebody knows everything. We hand out qualifications to lead maintenance tasks because we trust their ability to make good judgment calls. We've got publications our Marines reference on ruggedized computers that show them exactly how to perform maintenance actions and they followed them to the T, both out here and back in the hangar. However, there are certain situations that require young Marine NCOs to simultaneously demonstrate leadership, technical expertise and risk assessment in stressful environments. While there are support facilities on SCI, the Marines acted as if there weren't to make the exercise as realistic as possible. (Author) 'For example, if we strip out a screw or this nut and we don't have another one out here in the node, we can't just go to the hangar and get another one, right? So, what do we do? Is the jet flyable? What is the risk? How do I assess that? All of these questions are being asked in the corporal or sergeant’s head, alongside a clock that is always ticking, with little sleep and tough physical conditions weighing down on him or her. From the first weeks of boot camp, the Marines learn critical personal skills that allow them to be very deliberate with the tasks on which success of a huge upcoming strike, or the defense of the node, rests. I trust them implicitly with my life and the lives of my pilots, and they don’t let us down.' Guyette summed up his reflections on how his Marines get the job done, stating 'And so, in the last 48 hours we adapted to this field environment really well and that’s indicative of strong NCO leadership. The strength of any Marine unit is these E-4s and E-5s, corporals and sergeants. They run down the C-17 ramp, pop out of their tent with just their tool bag and they are turning jets around within minutes — landing them, recovering them, refueling them, arming them and de-arming them. And they're doing it without getting hurt and without breaking anything. They move quickly, with a sense of urgency, but they’re not rushing. I don't have to pick an all-star team. I don't have to pick my best Marines to do this kind of thing. They’re all like this, so there really isn’t an all-star team. We picked who was available and who was willing and they're knocking it out of the park.' All Six F-35Bs sit on the ramp at SCI. (Author) Busy Year For The Black Sheep The exercise finished a long year for VMFA-214 that saw them traveling to several countries across INDOPACOM as they prepare for an upcoming Unit Deployment Program (UDP). In May, the squadron left Yuma and landed on a flightline at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam during a trans-Pacific flight route to Royal Australian Air Force Base Tindall, Australia. There, Marines trained alongside allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific region for several weeks. VMFA 214 got the opportunity to participate with their Australian partners in Diamond Storm, which is the Australians’ Air Warfare Instructor Course, also known as AWIC. It's their culminating event of a multi-month weapon school. Prior to that, they teamed up with the Australian 75 Squadron, which is their F-35A Squadron based out of Tindall as well as their 3 squadron, which is in Williamstown on the east coast. F-35B trails the C-17 it is tasked with protecting during Steel Knight '24(Author) The Black Sheep also cut their teeth in hub-and-spoke operations in the First Island Chain this summer, participating in Marine Aviation Support Activity 2024, a multinational exercise based mostly out of the Philippines. VMFA-214 flew four jets from Australia to Clark Air Base in the Philippines and executed a littoral live fire exercise integrated with some artillery strikes, where they attacked and destroyed maritime targets off the coast of Luzon using precision munitions. Flying and fighting under Philippine command and control, they were in and out, returning to Australia to rejoin the fight within 72 hours and demonstrating the tactical value of an agile F-35 unit in INDOPACOM sphere of control. Speaking about the last few months, Guyette added, 'One of the things that I'm most excited about is we got the opportunity, after we came back from Australia, to go down to work Emerald Flag in Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida. We were working with the Kratos XQ-58, which is another potential capability that the Marine Corps is looking for Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA), Penetrating Autonomous Affordable Collaborative Killer Portfolio (PAACK-P), which we are now transitioning to MUX-TACAIR. We’re starting to explore the concept of ‘VMFAU,’ or maybe just 'VMF,' where we combined piloted and unpiloted tactical platforms to get after TACAIR mission sets. Armed, sensing and jamming remotely-piloted aircraft that you can launch from a node could potentially work in tandem with our aviators in fighter aircraft to win in our most challenging scenarios. We would control that from somewhere like a C2 node like we had out at SCI. The TACAIR squadrons of the future are going to be teamed up with unmanned assets, both launched from their position and from points elsewhere. We are considering many concepts of employment. In one of them, you may be flying in an F-35 and, the next day you are flying a CCA on the wing of your squadron mates from a ground station, controlling it from the node.

(DoD Image) Communication Directorate 'What the Black Sheep are clearly demonstrating is that the combination of manned and unmanned expeditionary TACAIR and advanced expeditionary C2 gives the Marine Corps a powerful, agile weapon, and it’s a strong value proposition to the joint force. It’s the ability to strike and move — hitting hard and then rapidly relocating while continuously integrated with our joint teammates, within the enemy’s WEZ. We are not quite there yet, but we now know exactly the skill sets and capabilities we need to develop. The Black Sheep are excited to push these concepts into reality, because it provides an incredibly difficult problem for those who would oppose us.' Summing up the experience of operating off of SCI, Guyette provided the big picture view. 'There were a lot of Marines that did some amazing things in the Solomon Islands. They were all heroes fighting from those islands. We are literally on an island practicing fighting from an island. As a commander, I have engaged and gone through all of the books from the Marine Corps Historical Society and even looked at some old pictures of how those bases were laid out, putting myself in the context and seeing the challenges that people had to go through 80 years ago. The challenges haven't changed, just the ranges are larger and farther and everything happens faster, but the things that made them successful yesterday are the things that will make us successful tomorrow.'

Dutch F-35s Now Helping Prevent Baltic Seafloor Cable Sabotage	NATO’s Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) has confirmed to TWZ that four Dutch F-35A stealth fighters are now also participating in Baltic Sentry, a mission intended to ensure the security of critical undersea infrastructure in the region. The jets were already in the region as part of the alliance’s Baltic Air Policing mission. Earlier this week, the Dutch Ministry of Defense released photos showing Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) F-35s flying over the two Dutch warships involved in Baltic Sentry, the De Zeven Provinciën class frigate HNLMS Tromp and the hydrographic survey vessel HNLMS Luymes. However, it hadn’t previously been confirmed that the combat jets were also directly contributing to this mission. A pair of Dutch F-35A stealth fighters over the Baltic. Dutch Ministry of Defense SHAPE provided TWZ with the following details about the involvement of Dutch F-35s in Baltic Sentry: 'Understanding the environment so we can prevent, mitigate, or respond to an identified threat, including damage to critical undersea infrastructure, is what an activity like NATO’s Baltic Sentry is all about. F-35s, along with other maritime patrol aircraft, assist in that regard. By operating in a multitude of domains, including the air domain, we increase our understanding, which the multirole F-35 can do very expediently.' Since the beginning of December, the RNLAF currently has had four F-35s deployed at Ämari Air Base in Estonia. They are there for the Baltic Air Policing mission, under which NATO air forces take turns deploying to air bases in Lithuania and Estonia, on a four-month rotational basis since the three Baltic States don’t have combat aircraft able to provide air policing over their own territories. Baltic Air Policing involves frequent interceptions of Russian Armed Forces aircraft moving between the heavily militarized Russian exclave of Kaliningrad and mainland Russia. These aircraft often fly close to NATO airspace without using transponders, communicating with air traffic control, or having filed a flight plan. This requires visual identification by NATO fighters on quick reaction alert. A map of the Baltic region. Google Earth Now, on top of these duties, the Dutch F-35s are flying at least some sorties for Baltic Sentry, a NATO mission that was launched earlier this week. It’s also part of a growing Dutch military presence on NATO’s eastern flank, which also includes ground troops as part of the alliance’s enhanced Forward Presence (eFP) posture in Lithuania. As you can read here, Baltic Sentry was established in response to possible sabotage actions on the Baltic seabed between Finland and Estonia. Most notably, in late December, the Estlink 2 undersea power cable and four telecommunications were damaged here, with suspicion falling upon the Russian-linked Eagle S oil tanker. The ship, found to be brimming with spy equipment, was seized by Finnish authorities for further investigation. The Swedish Navy ship HMS Belos found the anchor of the Eagle S, a Russian-linked oil tanker suspected of severing Estlink 2 and other undersea cables. Finnish Navy A video of the Eagle S after it was seized by Finnish authorities: Before this incident, in November, Germany said damage to two communication cables running under the Baltic Sea was most likely the result of sabotage. One of the cables in question runs between the Swedish island of Gotland and Lithuania, and the other between Finland and Germany. A Chinese cargo vessel, the Yi Peng 3, is at the center of allegations surrounding that damage, having been identified as operating near the cables when the incidents occurred. Subsequently, the Swedish Minister of Defense announced that the Norbalt undersea power cable linking Sweden with Lithuania was likely also purposely damaged by the Yi Peng 3. Officials suspect the Yi Peng 3 of severing cables running underneath the Baltic Sea. Photo by Mikkel Berg Pedersen / Ritzau Scanpix / AFP) / Denmark Baltic Sentry is primarily a vigilance mission, to ensure the security of critical submarine infrastructure, such as energy and data cables. For this purpose, it is mainly involving surface ships and maritime patrol aircraft, although, as we have recently discussed, at least 20 uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) will join the NATO effort in the coming weeks. In the context of the Dutch contribution, the survey vessel HNLMS Luymes is also currently the flagship of Standing NATO Mine Countermeasures Group 1, while the frigate HNLMS Tromp is also currently deployed as the flagship of the maritime mission. These two vessels are due to be joined next week by the Alkmaar class minehunters HNLMS Schiedam. The Dutch Ministry of Defense plans for these vessels to continue their Baltic Sentry mission at least until the end of February. From left to right: the survey vessel HNLMS Luymes, the frigate HNLMS Tromp, and a German Navy mine warfare vessel. Dutch Ministry of Defense Other vessels are also set to join the mission. NATO Maritime Command announced today on X the addition of a Finnish ship, the Hamina class missile boat Pori, and yesterday the addition of a Swedish ship, the corvette Visby, to Baltic Sentry. 'With this contribution, we are demonstrating our determination to step up our efforts,' said Vice Admiral René Tas, the commander of the Royal Netherlands Navy. 'We are making our presence and vigilance known and thus securing our submarine infrastructure. It is essential for the alliance to prevent destabilizing activities by deterrence on the one hand and by taking action if deterrence proves ineffective on the other.' As for the F-35s, these provide an entirely different set of surveillance capabilities to the Baltic Sentry mission. Previously, NATO had only mentioned that an unspecified number of crewed maritime patrol aircraft had been committed to Baltic Sentry, but not that fighter jets would also become involved. A video published earlier this month shows Dutch F-35s operating from Estonia for the Baltic Air Policing mission: However, the jets are able to rapidly cover the Baltic Sea area, most importantly being able to very rapidly respond to suspect activities on the surface of the water. As well as providing visual reconnaissance and ‘shows of force’ if required — for example, flying low over a vessel suspected of suspicious activity — the F-35 is also well equipped with organic electronic intelligence-gathering capabilities. As we have written about in the past, the F-35 is highly proficient at sucking up electronic signals, quickly classifying and geolocating them, and displaying them for the aircraft’s pilot. In an air combat context, this would typically include electronic emissions from hostile radars and air defense nodes, but its passive antennas can collect radio-frequency emissions of other kinds, also relevant in a maritime environment.

U.S. Air Force photo/ Master Sgt. Matthew Plew More generally, NATO surveillance is also drawing upon artificial intelligence capabilities, specifically under the U.K.-led Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF). This system was set up to protect critical undersea infrastructure and 'harnesses AI to assess data from a range of sources, including the Automatic Identification System (AIS) ships use to broadcast their position, to calculate the risk posed by each vessel entering areas of interest,' according to the British Ministry of Defense. You can read more about it here. In September of last year, the RNLAF announced that the F-35 had attained full operational capability, meaning that the stealth fighter was now responsible for the full spectrum of missions previously handled by the F-16, including the nuclear strike role. The last Dutch F-16s were formally retired in the same month, after 45 years of service, as you can read about here. Nevertheless, with only four Dutch F-35s in the Baltic, the level of availability that they can offer to the Baltic Sentry mission, on top of the more regular Baltic Air Policing, remains questionable. Should Baltic Sentry require additional combat jets for patrols and surveillance, then it would have to call upon other air forces in the region or rely on RNLAF jets flying from their home bases in the Netherlands. TWZ has reached out to the RNLAF for more details about how the F-35s will be used in the new mission. In the meantime, the contribution of Dutch F-35s to Baltic Sentry is certainly an interesting one. As the alliance seeks to better protect critical undersea infrastructure in the region, the stealth fighters provide a very visible reminder of NATO’s maritime presence, as well as a considerable boost to situational awareness.

Cheap Cruise Missile Paired With Affordable Seeker From Ship-Kill...	A new relatively cheap precision-guided air-launched stand-off munition the U.S. Air Force is working on could be employed against ships with the help of seeker technology from the service's Quicksink program. The Extended Range Attack Munition (ERAM), under development primarily for Ukraine, is otherwise shaping up to be a highly modular design, variants of which could be optimized for use against other target types. The Stand-In Strike Division of the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center's Armament Directorate, based at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, provided new details about ERAM, including plans to leverage work done under Quicksink, in a recent contracting notice. Plans for ERAM first emerged in January 2024. In addition to Ukraine, NATO allies Denmark and the Netherlands are also known to be involved in the program. Artwork the US Air Force has put out in the past depicting a general notional missile design. The service has not yet offered a look at the baseline ERAM design. USAF Artwork the US Air Force has put out in the past depicting a general notional missile design. USAF The Air Force 'is seeking support to procure ERAM hardware capability (GPS receivers, seekers, navigation units, radio solutions, datalink, or other capabilities to add operational capabilities to the weapon). The ERAM program is currently executing an Other Transaction Authority (OTA),' the contracting notice explains. 'The OTA will conclude with a Phase 2 development option, a full rate production OTA, and potential future development for additional capabilities. This request will support these future opportunities for the USAF to procure ERAM baseline configuration.' OTA is a Pentagon contracting mechanism intended to support rapid prototyping and other research development work without having to go through more traditional and often more drawn-out contracting processes. 'Future ERAM phases will incorporate various seekers, payloads, and capabilities to enhance performance in GPS-denied areas and or to produce ERAM variants to achieve disruptive effects when launched,' the notice adds. 'Equipment, interfaces, prototypes, engineering support, digital model integration support, and support documentation will be necessary to integrate these capabilities.' In line with this, the Air Force is now looking to get potential 'pricing and schedule for 10 BAE prototypes of the QuickSink seeker in a form factor to support ERAM integration and engineering efforts.' As TWZ has previously reported, the Quicksink seeker that has been developed and tested already on a modified 2,000-pound-class GBU-31/B Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) precision-guided bomb is a dual-mode design. It features a radar seeker and an imaging infrared (IIR) camera. The Quicksink JDAM uses its existing GPS-assisted inertial navigation system (INS) guidance package to get to a designated target area first. Once there, the weapon switches over to the seeker, which uses its two components to find and categorize the target by checking its length against a detailed internal reference database. The seeker also provides a velocity vector for the target and course corrects the munition's flight path so that it hits the water right next to it before exploding below the waterline for maximum damage. The combination of radar and IIR offers valuable targeting flexibility in all weather conditions. IIR cameras are also immune to radiofrequency electronic warfare jamming and provides enhanced target descrimination. The Quicksink seeker itself was designed with a high degree of modularity leveraging plug-and-play architecture to allow for the relatively rapid integration of new and improved functionality in the future, as well as to help keep costs down. The Air Force has said in the past that the initial examples of the seeker cost around $200,000 each, but that it was hoping to drive that unit down to at least $50,000. A model of the Quicksink seeker. Joseph Trevithick TWZ has noted in the past how the Quicksink seeker, or elements thereof, might be adaptable to other munitions, offering a relatively low-effort pathway for add-on anti-ship capability. What changes might be needed to integrate the seeker onto ERAM are unknown. The recent contracting notice also names three other subsystems for potential inclusion on ERAM – Marshall Deck of Cards (Marshall DoC), Shepherd, and FALCO – more specific details about which do not appear to be readily available. As with the Quicksink Seeker, mention is made of 'BAE' in relation to these other systems, which looks to be a reference to defense contractor BAE Systems. The Marshall DoC system is also described as 'the top priority for integration with the ERAM weapon' and appears to be particularly operationally sensitive with an explicit additional demand for 'a potential anti-tamper solution to establish root of trust and protect [its] &#8230; software from exploitation and or battlefield loss.' TWZ has reached out to the Air Force and BAE for more information. Details about the baseline ERAM configuration are still limited. In a previous contracting notice, the Air Force laid out requirements for a 500-pound-class precision munition with a range of up to 250 miles while flying at a speed of at least Mach 0.6. The weapon also has to use an INS-based guidance package 'capable of operating in a GPS degraded environment' and that offers 'terminal Accuracy' of 'CEP 50 w/in 10m' (the ability to impact within 10 meters, or around 33 feet, of a specified point at least 50 percent of the time) in 'both in non-EMI (Electromagnetic Interference) and high EMI environments (includes GPS degraded).' Regardless, pairing ERAM with the Quicksink seeker technology makes good sense, both for Ukraine and any other future users of the munition. The Air Force initiated Quicksink as a means to rapidly and cheaply increase its ability to launch aerial anti-ship attacks, to begin with. ERAM offers a way to then also extend the reach of that capability, helping keep launch platforms just that much further away from air defense threats. For Ukraine, ERAMs configured to strike targets at sea or on land would just offer a valuable new source of lower-cost air-launched precision-guided munitions. It's not hard to foresee additional interest in a munition of this kind for the same reason coming from the armed forces of other countries, including the U.S. military, either. In January 2024, the U.S. Navy put forward its own requirements for a Multi-Mission Affordable Capacity Effector (MACE), a lower-cost anti-ship missile that would also be small enough to fit inside the internal weapon bays on at least some variants of the stealthy F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. ERAM and MACE are just some of a number of known U.S. military projects currently exploring options for new longer-ranged precision-guided munitions that are also relatively low-cost and easy to produce at scale. Interest in types with anti-ship capability is particularly acute given the pricey slate of available air-launched options available to America's armed forces, including variants and derivatives of the AGM-84 Harpoon (including the Standoff Land Attack Missile Expanded Response, or SLAM-ER), the Joint Strike Missile (JSM), and the AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM). The unit price of the main LRASM variant currently in production, the AGM-158C-1, is around $3 million. A munition like ERAM would be shorter-ranged and have less advanced capabilities than LRASM, but a large stockpile of them could also help commanders keep more capable weapons in reserve for more heavily defended and otherwise challenging targets. Work now on projects like ERAM follows years of similar efforts and is being driven heavily by the expected demands of a future high-end fight. Especially in the opening phases of a potential major conflict in the Pacific with China, American forces would be called upon to prosecute tens of thousands of targets across a broad and highly-contested battlespace. There would then be a need to conduct sustained strike operations afterward, which would demand a steady pipeline of additional munitions. Many of America's allies and partners are planning around similar operational requirements. For the U.S. military, lessons learned from the conflict in Ukraine, as well as ongoing operations around the Middle East, have highlighted concerns about existing stockpiles of key munitions and the ability to replenish them. Much remains to be learned just about ERAM's baseline design, but we now know the Air Force at least plans to explore an anti-ship configuration taking advantage of the seeker from the Quicksink program.

This Shot Of USAF Explosive Ordnance Disposal Techs In The Middle...	U.S. Air Force explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) technicians assigned to the 379th Expeditionary Civil Engineer Squadron recently showed off the tools of their trade in absolutely spectacular fashion. The stunning photo was taken during a controlled demolition somewhere in the U.S. Central Command region. The picture, published on Jan. 10 by U.S. Air Forces Central Command (AFCENT), shows three squadron members, two wearing bomb suits, which are donned when remote manipulation of a device is not an option.

These troops and their equipment proved invaluable during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq protecting U.S. and partner forces. Between Sept. 27, 2002 and the time their mission in Afghanistan ended 12 years later, EOD airmen in Afghanistan and Iraq 'completed 55,847 missions and responded to 19,946 IEDs,' Air Force Times reported, citing AFCENT statistics. EOD airmen received more than 100 Purple Hearts and several valor awards for their actions. At least 20 EOD airmen were killed during these wars, 12 in Afghanistan and another eight in Iraq, the publication reported. All told, Air Force EOD techs saved countless lives and prevented many more injuries. The service of EOD troops was also given the Hollywood treatment in 2008's hit movie The Hurt Locker. Clearly they are pretty proud of their mission, as can be seen in this absolutely epic shot.

Extremely Low Altitude Shootdown Of Ukrainian Drone By Russian SA...	An intense video has emerged in Russia, showing a portion of a Ukrainian drone strike, including the interception of one of the drones by what is likely to have been a Pantsir short-range air defense system. Footage showing the successful interception of Ukraine’s long-range one-way attack drones by Russian ground-based air defenses is not generally common and this one reinforces the challenge posed by these relentless Ukrainian attacks against Russian infrastructure and military facilities. Meanwhile, it’s very much a textbook example of how a surface-to-air missile in this class can down targets even at very low level, with limited response time.

In the video, taken overnight, we can clearly hear the buzzing engine of a Ukrainian drone, as flashes from nearby explosions illuminate the clouds. We then see the rocket engine of a Russian surface-to-air missile moving from right to left and at a very low level. So low, in fact, is the missile, that the glare from its motor can be seen to illuminate nearby houses as it passes them. It then impacts its target in a shower of sparks and burning debris. The use of a surface-to-air missile in such close proximity to civilians and civilian infrastructure is noteworthy, but also a measure of the desperate efforts being taken to try and thwart these kinds of attacks. The illuminated rocket engine of the Russian surface-to-air missile seen low over Smolensk. via X After a brief pause, the noise of at least one other drone can be heard, indicating that this was an attack involving multiple drones. At around the halfway mark in the video above, we see, from below, a twin-boom Ukrainian drone as it flies low over a building, followed by an explosion. People then start to spill out of the building, seemingly mainly intrigued by the engagements happening around them. Based on its appearance, the drone could be the same as the type that was notably used in an attack on Russian air defenses in Crimea in September 2023. In particular, the pusher engine configuration and extended wing roots match with this drone, the name of which remains undisclosed. A Ukrainian twin-boom long-range one-way attack drone seen in the video from Smolensk. via X The Ukrainian twin-boom attack drone that was used in an attack on Yevpatoria, Crimea, in September 2023. via X We can’t say for sure that the missile was, as widely reported, from a Pantsir short-range air defense system (SHORADS), although it would seem most likely. The Pantsir has been deployed widely to defend critical infrastructure within Russia, including on top of government buildings in Moscow, where they appeared in early 2023 after Ukraine demonstrated its ability to conduct strikes at extended ranges. In the wheeled Pantsir-S1 configuration that is primarily used for defending infrastructure, civil and military, the system is armed with up to six ready-to-fire 57E-series command-guided missiles and also has two 30mm automatic cannons. Crews use the system’s integrated radar and infrared sensor to target aerial threats. The missiles reportedly have a maximum range of around 11 miles and can hit targets at altitudes up to around 50,000 feet, although this is very much a best-case scenario and depends on the exact missile variant and the profile of the threat. However, the system is primarily designed for low-altitude, close-in point defense. This includes swatting down cruise missiles, tactical aircraft, and air-to-ground munitions. Drones, too, are one of the main targets for the Pantsir. Reportedly, the target of the Ukrainian drone strike in last night’s video was the Smolensk Aviation Plant, which is operated by the Tactical Missiles Corporation, Russia’s major producer of air-launched precision-guided munitions. Its portfolio includes a wide range of tactical air-to-ground missiles, as well as air-to-air missiles.

Reports of further attacks against the Smolensk Aviation Plant appeared in November of the same year. Smolensk Aviation Plant is located adjacent to the airport in the same city, with the facility being seen here at the bottom right of the airfield. Google Earth The approximate location of Smolensk within Russia. Google Earth The last couple of days have seen Russian aerospace and air-launched munitions industries targeted by Ukrainian long-range drones. Overnight on Sunday, Ukrainian drones struck the Kazan Aircraft Plant in Kazan, around 700 miles from the front line in Ukraine. This facility is responsible for manufacturing, modernizing, and maintaining Russian heavy bombers, including the Tu-160 Blackjack, the only aircraft in its class that remains in production in Russia. According to reports, the drone strike resulted in a fire at a fuel depot near the factory. Russian Telegram channels report a drone attack on an aircraft plant in Kazan, Russia.

As well as aircraft and missile production and maintenance facilities, Ukrainian drones have, in recent weeks, also been sent against Russian air bases, including Engels, a long-range bomber base in the Saratov region in southern Russia. Here, a fuel storage facility appears to have been the intended target, with strikes against it on more than one occasion already this month. Satellite images from the oil depot near Engels-2 air base on Sentinel came available. At least 8 tanks have burned out, but more are possible. We will have to wait for better satellite images to confirm the damage.&mdash; NOELREPORTS (@noelreports.com) 2025-01-18T16:33:39.714Z Fuel depots elsewhere in Russia have been targeted too, as Ukraine seeks to deprive Russian combat aircraft — and the wider armed forces — of vital petroleum, oils, and lubricants. For some time now, Russia’s energy infrastructure has been a priority target for Kyiv, but the apparent focus now on military-oriented targets is noteworthy. To some degree, these tactics have likely been driven by Russia’s own efforts to protect its bombers on the ground, which have seen the aircraft increasingly dispersed to airfields further from the front lines. This is in addition to a range of decoys and other countermeasures installed at their regular bases. With this in mind, static production and maintenance plants, as well as sprawling fuel farms, are much more reliable targets for Ukrainian drone strikes. As to Russian efforts to stop the Ukrainian drones from getting through, these have, since the start of such Ukrainian raids, achieved mixed results. While official Russian accounts frequently claim a 100 percent success rate against drone strikes, there is mounds of evidence of damage caused by those that do manage to get through. Undoubtedly, Russian ground-based air defenses — as well as aircraft — are extracting a toll on incoming Ukrainian drones. However, the footage captured over the Smolensk region last night does provide what’s a rare view from deep inside Russia of an apparently successful drone interception by a Russian point defense surface-to-air missile.

Navy Says It Won’t Repeat Cruiser Upgrade Blunder With Destroyer ...	As the U.S. Navy proceeds with modernizing its Flight IIA Arleigh Burke class destroyers with advanced electronic warfare, radar and combat systems upgrades, the head of the so-called DDG Modernization 2.0 program said the service has learned lessons from its deeply troubled Ticonderoga class cruiser modernization efforts, and several guardrails are in place to avoid similar pitfalls. TWZ has reported extensively on the congressionally mandated cruiser modernization effort, and how nearly $4 billion was spent modernizing seven of the ships, which have for years served in the air defense commander role for carrier strike groups (CSG), among other missions. But of those seven large surface combatants, none ended up gaining the extra five years of service life originally envisioned. The former Navy cruiser USS Chancellorsville (CG-62), renamed USS Robert Smalls in 2023. (Commander Fleet Activities Yokosuka Facebook page) Instead, nearly half that money was wasted modernizing four cruisers that never returned to sea and were retired by the Navy, according to a Government Accountability Office (GAO) assessment, which warned that efforts like DDG Modernization 2.0 carried the same risks if the Navy didn’t learn from its mistakes. But as DDG Modernization 2.0 continues, with one Burke returning to the water after the first phase of modernization and three slated to follow this calendar year, several aspects of that program seek to prevent a repeat of the cruiser fiasco, Capt. Timothy Moore, DDG Modernization 2.0 program manager, told TWZ in an interview late last week. 'We’re taking some of the bad things that happened during cruiser modernization and properly implementing them, with the oversight at the O-6 level, to support an effective program and keep us ahead of the game as we modernize and resend these ships back out to the fleet,' Moore said. While implementing best practices from other modernization or new Navy construction programs to 'avoid any of the pitfalls that occurred during the cruiser modernization era,' the directive standing up DDG Modernization 2.0 also called for a major program manager – an executive tasked with overseeing a complex Navy program or organization – to run the effort, he added. 'That in itself gives the acquisition and technical rigor to this program that you did not see during the cruiser modernization timeline,' Moore said. BREAKING: USS Pinckney (DDG 91) Arleigh Burke-class Flight IIA guided missile destroyer leaving San Diego after two year DDG MOD 2.0 upgrade with SEWIP Block 3 - November 7, 2023 #usspinckney #ddg91More info - webcam pic.twitter.com/wVFcyurfXY&mdash; WarshipCam (@WarshipCam) November 7, 2023 DDG Modernization 2.0 also involves an independent cost estimate of the initiative 'to make sure we are true to ourselves when it comes to the true cost of this program,' he said, adding that a formalized acquisition strategy and integrated master schedule have also helped keep the program running smoothly thus far. Navy officials have not responded to TWZ requests for costs and other information regarding the effort, but TWZ has in the past reported that the program was slated to cost $10 billion to modernize 23 destroyers. The USS Pinckney (DDG-91) is the lone destroyer to complete the first upgrade phase in late 2023. Moore said three destroyers currently undergoing the work are slated to come out of that maintenance availability later this year with the first phase completed and returned to the fleet. The USS Pinckney (DDG-91) in September 2023 as it was nearing completion of a host of upgrades to its electronic warfare systems, radar and combat systems. (USS Pinckney Facebook page) TWZ previously reported that those ships are the USS James E. Williams (DDG-95), USS Chung Hoon (DDG-93), and USS Halsey (DDG-97). While such work is done in two phases, USNI News’ Aaron-Matthew Lariosa reported last week that the USS Sterrett (DDG-104), will be the first destroyer to receive all upgrades in one availability. Such work generally takes two years, according to Moore, who stressed the Navy is still 'very early' in its efforts. 'We are pretty much hitting the mark with our redelivering these ships back to the fleet in a timely manner, according to the schedule and the contracts that we have in place,' he said. The work is being done during a destroyer’s mid-life upgrade, or around 15 years into service, which ensures they are not being pulled out in a way that disrupts fleet operations, Moore said. Schedules for the upgrades can also depend on the ship’s operational schedule. 'But with these ships, and because they are destroyers, which are pretty much sort of the workhorses of the Navy, which we’ve kept maintained pretty well, we are able to meet on-time redelivery of these ships back to the fleet,' he said. Pinckney got back underway in late 2023 sporting an enlarged superstructure with geometric structures extending off the port and starboard bridge wings, leading some online wiseacres to dub it a 'muffin top' destroyer.

(X/@WarshipCam) (X/@WarshipCam) That top-heavy look is due to the AN/SLQ-32(V)7 Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program Block III, or SEWIP Block III, electronic warfare system installed on the warship during modernization. You can read more about the destroyer's new 'supersized' look in this past post of ours. 'Those sponsons are housing some of the electronics required to support that expanded capability,' said Moore, who declined to provide further details in an unclassified setting. TWZ has regularly reported on SEWIP Block III’s groundbreaking features: 'Northrop Grumman’s SEWIP Block III suite itself represents a revolutionary capability leap over previous iterations of the AN/SLQ-32 system. The new variant features active electronically scanned array (AESA) technology capable of putting out powerful and highly focused bursts of radio-frequency energy that can be used to launch electronic attacks on multiple targets along different vectors simultaneously. It also has advanced capabilities to detect, geolocate, and categorize threats passively. The system’s arrays have the potential to also be used as radars and communications nodes.' A rendering of the SEWIP Block III electronic warfare system. (www.TWZ.com) Upgraded destroyers will also eventually sport the AN/SPY-6(V)4 radar. As TWZ has reported, the AN/SPY-6(V)4 radar is a scaled-down version of the AN/SPY-6(V)1 Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) that is a key component of the Flight III Arleigh Burke design. All AN/SPY-6 radars sport active electronically scanned arrays and are comprised of groups of cube-shaped Radar Modular Assemblies (RMAs). The (V)1 version has four fixed arrays each with 37 RMAs. The (V)4 has four fixed arrays, as well, but with 24 RMAs apiece. 'We are upgrading the Aegis Combat System’s baseline 10, which will match that SPY-6 radar,' he said. 'And then we’re also, because of the increased requirement for cooling, replacing the air conditioning plants with the high-efficiency, super-capacity chillers, which are currently resident in the Flight III and some of our other amphibious platforms.' The AN/SPY-6(V)1 radar affixed aboard the Navy Flight III destroyer USS Jack H. Lucas (DDG-125). (RTX) While such superstructure alterations add weight to the ship, the Navy has added ballast aft of the ship so that it 'still rides very well,' Moore said. 'From my conversations with the [Pinckney] CO, she handles very well out to sea, and you don’t really notice that extra bulk on the port and starboard sides, other than visually,' he said. TWZ reported this week on how the Navy is increasingly using Flight IIA destroyers as the air defense commander for carrier strike groups (CSG), a role traditionally filled by the retiring cruisers. A warship serving as a CSG air defense commander is responsible for tracking any and all objects in the sky for the CSG, and coordinating actions across the CSG to investigate and, if need be, neutralize those threats. They are the nerve center of the air warfare fight and have the ability to use all the air defense assets in the CSG to achieve their objectives. While that initiative is distinct from DDG Modernization 2.0, Moore said ships like the Pinckney that undergo the upgrades 'will be good candidates' to serve as air defense commander in the future. 'That depends on the demands of the fleet,' he said. As the Navy awaits more of its Flight IIIs to come online, a Burke variant that is being afflicted by cost increases and delivery delays, efforts like DDG Modernization 2.0 seek to ensure that American destroyers remain the versatile and survivable workhorses of the surface fleet. Such expanded capabilities could prove crucial in a future war with China that military brass have been warning about for years.

NASA’s ‘New’ Boeing 777 Undergoes Modifications For Its Future Fl...	NASA’s new flying laboratory, an ex-commercial Boeing 777 airliner, has arrived in Waco, Texas, for modifications ahead of its entry into service. The aircraft will replace the agency’s now-retired Douglas DC-8, a venerable aircraft that made its final flight in May of last year, as you can read about here. Aviation photographer @SR_Planespotter shared photos of the 777’s arrival at Waco on January 13. The aircraft is there to undergo what NASA describes as structural modifications. These will almost certainly be carried out by L3Harris Technologies, a well-established aircraft systems integrator, working with military and commercial platforms. The NASA 777 arrives at Waco on January 13. @SR_Planespotter NASA 777 (N577NA) Landed near Waco, Texas, United States. pic.twitter.com/oXLrjHAMhu&mdash; NASA Aircraft Tracking (@NASAAircraft) January 13, 2025 As well as needing to replace the DC-8 specifically, the need for the new flying laboratory was identified more generally in a 2021 report from the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM). It highlighted 'the need to maintain and improve upon the capability to carry a variety of remote sensing and gas sampling instruments in order to answer some of the most challenging questions in Earth science.' @SR_Planespotter Manufactured in 2003, the NASA 777-200ER was previously operated by Japan Airlines, or JAL as JA704J before going into storage at Southern California Logistics Airport in Victorville, where it arrived in May 2020. Japan Airlines 777-200ER JA704J at Amsterdam-Schiphol Airport in the Netherlands in August 2007. Andre Wadman/Wikimedia Commons In December 2022, the aircraft was acquired by NASA, at a cost of less than $30 million, based on the agency’s Fiscal Year 2023 budget documents. The same month, the aircraft received the U.S. registration N774LG and was flown out of the storage facility to Langley Air Force Base, Virginia, where it underwent a previous series of modifications at the NASA Langley Research Center. The NASA 777 flying laboratory at Langley as the aircraft was prepared for its first flight from there, in May of last year. David C. Bowman/NASA The 777 will fly a similar range of research missions as its predecessor, the 1969-vintage DC-8, another ex-commercial airframe that entered NASA service in 1987. Broadly speaking, these missions are divided into four categories: sensor development, satellite sensor verification, telemetry data retrieval and optical tracking for space vehicle launch and re-entry, and research studies of the Earth’s surface and atmosphere. The sensor testbed mission involves verifying prototype instruments, including those that will be carried aboard satellites, ensuring that they work within the Earth’s atmosphere before going into space. Meanwhile, sensors already in use aboard satellites are verified, checking that they are properly calibrated. This kind of mission involves the aircraft flying under the satellite’s path, using its own instruments to replicate the data collected by the satellite. The two data sets are then compared for error. The tail of the NASA 777. @SR_Planespotter Telemetry data retrieval sees the aircraft use a tracking antenna — this was fitted in the DC-8’s nose — to receive launch vehicle telemetry data, which might be in support of NASA’s own space missions or for Missile Defense Agency programs, for example. Optical tracking systems are meanwhile used to monitor spacecraft re-entering the Earth’s atmosphere. Finally, Earth sciences missions include using sensors aboard the aircraft to monitor all kinds of activities and phenomena on the surface of the globe, including studying polar ice fields and monitoring wildfires. These types of missions are flown under NASA’s Airborne Science Program and, with its large payload capacity, long-range capability, and onboard laboratory equipment, the 777 will be ideally suited for them. The NASA 777 about to touch down at Waco on January 13. @SR_Planespotter NASA says the 777 will be able to accommodate between 50 and 100 onboard operators, significantly more than the 45 researchers and flight crew that typically flew aboard the DC-8. At the same time, the 777 offers a useful payload of 75,000 pounds, compared with the 30,000 pounds of scientific instruments and equipment that the Douglas jetliner could haul aloft. Using the DC-8, NASA was able to fly science missions typically lasting between six and 10 hours, although 12-hour missions were feasible. The 777 will have a mission duration of 18 hours, NASA says, although this will depend on the particular payload and weather conditions. According to NASA, the 777’s modifications at the Langley Research Center included fitting new observation ports; power, data, and communications systems; and accommodation for instrument operators. Looking around the aircraft gives away few signs of modifications, although these may well appear once the next phase of work begins at Waco. @SR_Planespotter NASA’s previous DC-8 was outfitted with various instrument ports, including modified windows in which different sensors and probes could be mounted. Other antenna mounts could be carried externally, including on wing pylons. Meanwhile, the surface of the aircraft had additional optical windows, made of various materials, as well as sampling probes to take air and aerosol samples. The DC-8 also had a delivery tube for deploying unguided sensor pods, known as dropsondes. Nighttime interior shot of the now-retired NASA DC-8 during a transit flight. NASA photo by Michael Studinger NASA expects the modifications for the 777 to be completed by September 30 this year, after which the new research aircraft should undertake its first operations for the agency out of Langley. While it surely lacks the charisma of the catfish-nosed DC-8, the 777 continues the modernization of NASA’s test aircraft fleet, which also saw the retirement of the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, or SOFIA, a kind of flying telescope housed in an adapted Boeing 747SP, in 2022. NASA’s new flying laboratory is set to be a more than capable successor to the DC-8 and, like its predecessor, should have a long career providing valuable data to federal and state authorities, as well as U.S. academic institutes and other scientists around the world.

No Suspects In FBI’s New Jersey Drone Scare Investigation, Dozens...	An FBI investigation into thousands of reported drone sightings around New Jersey late last year has uncovered no suspects or recovered any drones, a spokesperson told us. In addition, scores of temporary flight restrictions (TFRs) imposed by the FAA on drone flights over sensitive facilities throughout the region have expired. Meanwhile, on his first day back in the Oval Office, President Donald Trump repeated his vow that his new administration would provide more details about the spate of drone sightings in the northeast that The War Zone was the first to report. They garnered massive media coverage and caused a low-level panic among some residents. 'I would like to find out what it is and tell the people,' Trump said Monday in response to a question of whether he would use his powers to tell the American public more about the drone incursions. 'In fact, I would like to do that.' Trump asked Susie Wiles, his chief of staff, to find and share more details. 'Can we find out what that was?' Trump asked her. 'Susie, why don't we find out immediately?' The president then expressed his own curiosity about the incursions. 'I can't imagine it's an enemy, or people would have gotten blown up all over. Maybe they were testing things? I don’t know why they wouldn’t have said what it was.' As we have previously reported, often confusing legal and regulatory hurdles limit how and when counter-drone systems of any kind can be used in the United States. Concerns about risks of collateral damage resulting from the use of anti-drone capabilities are another huge factor. As a result, the U.S. military isn’t currently allowed to field kinetic and directed energy capabilities, such as laser and high-power microwave weapons, surface-to-air interceptors, and gun systems, for defending domestic bases and other critical infrastructure from rapidly growing and evolving drone threats. Instead, the focus is on electronic warfare and cyber warfare, and other ‘soft-kill’ options, at least for the time being. Even these capabilities are in limited use and are only even effective against a relatively narrow set of drone types. However, one of the scores of Executive Orders Trump signed on Monday - declaring a national emergency at the border with Mexico - called for the Secretary of Transportation and the Federal Communications Commission to 'consider waiving all applicable Federal Aviation Administration and Federal Communications Commission regulations or policies, respectively, that restrict the Department of Homeland Security’s ability to counter unmanned aerial systems within 5 miles of the southern border.' Trump’s comments about drone disclosures on Monday followed his earlier pledges to get to the bottom of a situation that the Biden administration deemed not to be a threat to national security or public safety and had no foreign nexus. 'I’m going to give you a report on drones about one day into the administration,' Trump told a room of Republican governors at his Mar-a-Lago resort earlier this month. 'Because I think it’s ridiculous that they are not telling you about what is going on with the drones.' President Trump: Drone Report on Jan. 21Trump: 'I hope it’s not an enemy, but we’re going to find out… They know and it’s very strange they aren’t talking about it.'Governor Landry: '[Last week] we had drones being flown over our nuclear reactors in Louisiana.' pic.twitter.com/XRnRIn9Er4&mdash; UAP James (@UAPJames) January 10, 2025 For Trump, the issue of mystery drones flying overhead is personal. His golf club in Bedminster was one of the scores of locations that reported them. 'They had a lot of them flying over Bedminster, which was interesting,' Trump explained on Monday. The incursions weren't Trump's first drone concerns. In January 2021, an image highly suggestive of a drone targeting him on a golf course in a 'vengeance' strike in retaliation for the death of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani led Twitter to ban an account for Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei at the time. The U.S. military killed Soleimani in a drone strike in Iraq in January 2020, which had already prompted public threats from Iranian officials, including against Trump specifically. (Via Twitter) The ongoing FBI investigation into the drone incursions has produced few publicly known results. In addition to finding no suspects, no drones have been recovered. 'It’s not unusual in a case like this not to have a suspect,' FBI spokesperson Amy Thoreson explained, adding that there has been a 'significant decrease' in reported sightings. In December, the FBI stated that there were more than 5,000 reports of mystery drones, with only about 100 deemed worthy of further investigation. 'If anyone sees anything, they can report it,' she stated. TWZ has reviewed many video and images taken by citizens who reported seeing the drones. We have seen no proof of any widespread drone incursions throughout the state, with the vast majority of material in circulation claiming to show drones actually depicting standard aircraft or, in a very limited quantity, common hobbiest drones. After the public outcry over the drone sightings, the FAA issued scores of Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs) warning operators away from flying drones largely over power facilities in New Jersey. Not long after, these expanded to New York. Some 22 installations were initially put under TFR in the former and a whopping 68 in the latter. This number grew further not long after. It is not clear what intelligence, if any, led to this action. In addition, TFRs were imposed over Picatinny Arsenal and the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster among other locations. All but the one over Bedminster expired and were not renewed. The one over Bedminster was extended through Jan 31. The club was under regular TFRs, especially during Trump's time in office whenever he was present there. TFR's over sensitive energy sites (small red circles) issued last month during the height of the drone scare. (1800WXBRIEF.COM) Drone operators who do not comply with the restrictions over Bedminster are warned that the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, and Justice 'may take security action that results in the interference, disruption, seizure, damaging or destruction of unmanned aircraft deemed to pose a credible safety or security threat to protected personnel, facilities or assets.' (FAA) We reached out to the FAA and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) about why the TFRs were allowed to expire and whether new ones or permanent bans would be issued. 'Drones are prohibited from flying over designated national security-sensitive facilities,' an FAA spokesperson told us on Tuesday, adding the administration maintains a map of restricted security-sensitive airspace. The spokesman deferred additional questions about whether any of the expired TFRs will be renewed to DHS, which has yet to respond to several queries. We will update this story with any pertinent information provided. The TFR over Picatinny was replaced by a 'permanent National Security UAS Flight Restriction,' garrison commander, Lt. Col. Craig A. Bonham II, told us on Tuesday. There were 11 confirmed incursions over Picatinny between Nov. 13 and Dec. 6 and six unconfirmed, a facility spokesman added. Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey reported nearly a dozen confirmed drone sightings late last year. (U.S. Army photo) It is unclear at the moment if Trump’s directive to his chief of staff also includes finding and sharing new details about the drone incursions over Langley Air Force Base, that we were first to report. Many other military installations in the Continental United States, like Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and Marine Corps Base Camp Pendelton, have also been subjected to drones of unknown origin intruding over their airspace, as had the Air Force’s Plant 42 advanced aerospace development hub in California this past fall. The War Zone was the first to report all those incidents. There were also drone incursions over U.S. bases in the United Kingdom in November that we were also the first to report. The last of those took place on November 26, a spokesperson for the 48th Fighter Wing at RAF Lakenheath told us. While the number of drone sightings, which once reached a fever pitch, have greatly diminished, Trump has signaled that the issue will not fade away under his watch.

Ukraine Is Burning Through 155mm M777 Howitzer Barrels So Fast Th...	The U.S. Army is moving to establish a second production source for barrels for 155mm M777 towed howitzers in response to what it calls 'unprecedented demand' from Ukraine. Only one U.S. government-owned and operated arsenal makes the barrels and that facility cannot currently meet a requirement to churn out more than 30 new ones each month. Discussion of the need for more barrels for M777 howitzers was included in a recently released Pentagon budget document dated December 17, 2024, which details several so-called reprogramming actions related to U.S. military assistance to Ukraine. The M777's barrel, or 'cannon,' technically has its own separate designation, M776. The U.S. military is required by law to get approval from Congress to reallocate funding from one part of its budget to another. The full entry regarding the M777 barrels reads: 'Funds are required for 155mm cannon tube second source in support of Ukraine. Includes procurement, factory improvements, production equipment and tooling, etc. in direct support of replenishment items provided to Ukraine. The high volume of artillery fire missions has created an unprecedented demand for M776 155mm Cannon Tubes (39 caliber), with a projected requirement of over 30 tubes per month. The current manufacturer of cannons, Watervliet Arsenal (WVA) [in New York state], a Government Owned Government Operated (GOGO) facility, has not been able to support the demand. Facilitization investment will support up to 10 cannon tubes per month, including large cannon calibers. This is a congressional special interest item. This is an emergency budget requirement.' The relevant portion of the recent Pentagon reprogramming document. DOD The reprogramming document shows that $161 million was reallocated to the Army for this effort from a dedicated Ukraine Replacement Transfer Fund within the Pentagon's budget. The lifespan of a barrel for any howitzer depends on a variety of factors, including firing rates. The barrels do wear out, and degradation of the rifling and overall internal structure can lead to reduced range and accuracy, as well as the potential for catastrophic failure. Firing a high volume of rounds, especially with full propellant charges to get maximum range, in a relatively short amount of time can only increase the wear rate. The U.S. Marine Corps notably highlighted having 'burned out' the barrels on two of their M777s during fighting against ISIS in the Syrian city of Raqqa in 2017. The U.S. Army's metrics for determining when the cannon on an M777 needs to be replaced are not publicly available. It is unclear how many M777s Ukraine has received from the U.S. military and other sources since Russia launched its all-out invasion in February 2022. A Pentagon factsheet put out in December simply says the United States has provided 'more than 200 155mm howitzers,' which also includes variants of the self-propelled M109. The Ukrainian armed forces have received at least four more M777s from Canada and another six from Australia. Four M777s bound for Ukraine seen inside a Royal Australian Air Force C-17 cargo plane in April 2022. Australian Department of Defense How many M777s are in active Ukrainian service today is also not clear. There is visual documentation of nearly 100 M777s having been damaged or destroyed in Russian attacks, which may not reflect the complete total. Some damaged howitzers could have been put back into operation, as well.

Issues around ensuring sufficient supplies of ammunition for those howitzers have drawn particular attention in the past year or so. The United States and several European countries have been working to dramatically step up production of those shells to help meet Ukrainian demands, as well as replenish their own stockpiles. Past Ukrainian pronouncements about the number of 155mm rounds required to meet its operational requirements – at times up to 3,000 per day – give a good sense of the rate at which the country's forces have been firing shells from howitzers like the M777.

Direct shot!Footage by Operational Command South. pic.twitter.com/a1JwJ4Pn6L&mdash; Defense of Ukraine (@DefenceU) July 12, 2022 The Pentagon reprogramming document underscores how the matter of ammunition supplies is just one serious issue facing Ukrainian artillery units. This all also speaks to real issues that the U.S. military itself could be faced with in the future, especially high-end ones like a fight with China in the Pacific. If U.S. capacity to produce things like replacement barrels for M777s is insufficient to meet the needs of Ukraine's armed forces, it is hard to see how it could respond to far greater demands from American forces during a major conflict. Lessons being learned from the conflict in Ukraine, as well as current operations across the Middle East, have already been having significant impacts on thinking about how the U.S. military should structure its own arsenal, especially stockpiles of key munitions, and be prepared to replenish it going forward. American obligations to the Ukrainian military, as well as operational demands in the Middle East, have also prompted serious criticism about the adequacy of current stockpiles. It's also worth noting here that the Pentagon reprogramming document indicates that the U.S. Army's planned investment in additional capacity to produce M777 barrels could also be used to make other large caliber 'cannons' in the future. The Army has not ordered any new production M777s for itself since 2019 and has been going back and forth in recent years on the possibility of replacing them, as well as its 105mm M119 towed howitzers. The U.S. Marine Corps has also been dramatically down-sizing its inventory of M777s in favor of additional High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) and new ground-based missile launchers as part of a larger restructuring effort. Members of the US Army train with an M777 howitzer. US Army When it comes to Ukraine, there is also now great uncertainty over the future of U.S. military assistance to Ukraine under President Donald Trump. Among a flurry of executive orders Trump has signed within the first 24 hours of assuming office is one putting a complete hold on all American foreign aid for the next 90 days pending individual reviews of those efforts. It's not clear yet what the actual impacts of the order may be and it does include a provision for restarting the flow of aid sooner on a case-by-case basis. Trump has also been vocally in favor of a deal to end the conflict and has said he plans to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Putin 'should make a deal. I think he's destroying Russia by not making a deal,' Trump told reporters at the White House yesterday following his inauguration. 'I mean, he’s grinding it out, but most people thought that war would have been over in about one week and now you’re into three years.' Donald Trump says he could speak to Putin very soon. 'He's not doing so well, so he can't be thrilled. &#8230; Zelenskyy wants to make a deal. I don't know if Putin does. He might not. He should make a deal. I think he's destroying Russia by not making a deal.'

All of this also comes as Russia has been making battlefield gains, although ones assessed to have come at significant cost, in eastern Ukraine. Casualty rates on the Ukrainian side have also become increasingly worrisome, as highlighted by a recent scandal over reports that members of the Ukrainian Air Force, including important maintenance personnel, had been sent to fight as infantry on the front lines. Ukraine's armed forces also just recently launched a new push inside Russia's Kursk region, which has been partially occupied since last August.

Houthi Pledge To Curtail Ship Attacks Sparks New Security Assessm...	In response to a Houthi pledge to cease attacks on non-Israeli-linked Red Sea shipping in the wake of the Gaza War ceasefire, a global leader in the maritime security industry issued a new threat assessment on Monday. Ambrey suggested the region around the Bab el-Mandeb Strait could be about to enter a period of reduced danger for those vessels transiting through the area if — and it's a big if — the Houthis actually stick to their word. The Houthi-linked Humanitarian Operations Coordination Center (HOCC), which serves as a conduit between Houthi forces and commercial shipping operators, sent an email to the shipping industry on Sunday saying that it would no longer attack U.S. and U.K.-linked ships in the wake of the ceasefire that went into effect Jan. 19 with the exchange of three Israeli hostages held by Hamas and dozens of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. HOCC added that Houthis would also stop attacking Israeli-linked vessels 'upon the full implementation of all phases of the agreement.' That is a reference to Phase 2 of the ceasefire, which is scheduled to take effect in about five weeks. The letter does not mention any other nations. HOCC Given that the rebel group has attacked vessels with dubious ties to Israel, it remains unclear how they will make that distinction moving forward. Regardless, the Houthis say they will resume kinetic actions against ships connected to the U.S. or U.K. if the militant group's assets and personnel are subjected to further airstrikes. 'We affirm that, in the event of any aggression against the Republic of Yemen by the United States of America, the United Kingdom, or the usurping Israeli entity, the sanctions will be reinstated against the aggressor state (s),' the HOCC notice continued. 'You will be promptly informed of such measures should they be implemented.' You can see one of those ship attacks in the following video. Ambrey on Monday suggested that the HOCC proclamation would have a positive impact on non-Israel-linked shipping if the Houthis lived up to their pledge. 'The coming weeks will provide the proof of whether the Houthi follow suit with their stated intent,' Ambrey assessed. 'During this period, the threat to all shipping is reduced apart from Israeli-owned-and-flagged vessels. However, this is subject to flashpoint escalation if the Houthi consider Israel in breach of the ceasefire agreement.' Ambrey also assessed that 'shipping with links to Israel and Israeli trade to be at greater risk than U.S.- and U.K.-owned shipping as the ceasefire remains fragile and secondary negotiations continue. Houthi military action in response to a perceived breach of the ceasefire agreement by Israel remains possible and would highly likely impact Israeli-affiliated shipping first.'

(Photo by Ramzi Mahmud/Anadolu via Getty Images) Anadolu Ambrey urged caution about Houthi promises. 'The Joint Maritime Information Center (JMIC) issued the warning: Maritime industry should be skeptical of recent Houthi claims,' the company noted, referring to a U.K.-led information-sharing effort on Houthi attacks. Houthi statements, especially claims of attacks on U.S. or U.K. warships, are frequently made without merit. The most recent example of that came on Sunday when the Houthis claimed to have targeted the USS Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group for the eighth time. Over the past year, the Houthis have claimed successful ships on U.S. Navy ships, which never actually occurred. 'We have nothing operational to provide,' a U.S. official told The War Zone in response to our question about the veracity of the Houthis’ latest attack claim. The shipping attacks began in November 2023 in solidarity with Palestinians over the latest war between Israel and Gaza. They have forced ships to avoid the Suez Canal for a far longer route around Africa, boosting cargo costs by nearly $200 billion. The Houthis attacks sank two vessels, damaged many others, caused the death of four mariners, and led to many being held hostage after a ship was seized. The Houthi Red Sea campaign also led to nearly constant military engagements with the U.S. and its allies, including air strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen and repelling the militant group’s frequent missile, aerial drone, and drone boat attacks on commercial and military vessels. The Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Carney fires a surface-to-air missile at Houthi threats on October 19, 2023. (USN) The Hapag-Lloyd shipping company told The War Zone it is too early to say if they will resume shipping through the Suez Canal. 'We will continue to closely monitor and analyze the latest developments and their impact on the security situation in the Red Sea,' Tim Seifert, a spokesman for the Hapag-Lloyd shipping company told The War Zone on Monday. 'Otherwise, the following applies unchanged: we will return to the Red Sea when it is safe to do so.' In addition to effects on commercial shipping, the U.S. military stands to benefit dramatically from any real reduction in Houthi belligerence in the Red Sea region. Navy vessels - which have had to maintain a constant presence in this area - have expended hundreds of expensive munitions taking down Houthi threats. That's forced those ships to leave the area to replenish. The constant Red Sea region patrols have been at the cost of presence elsewhere in the world and put a heavy strain on ships and crews. In addition to battles at sea, U.S. Navy aviation assets, as well as cruise missiles, and U.S. Air Force and Royal Air Force aircraft have carried out repeated strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen. Israel has also pounded the rebel group from the air. A full breakdown of what each of the Navy's missiles cost is seen in the exclusive TWZ video below: It is unclear how seriously the U.S. and its allies take this new Houthi pledge. We have reached out to U.S. Central Command, the U.K. Defense Ministry, and the European Union’s Operation Aspides maritime security effort for more details. It's also a question of just how many munitions the Houthis still have after nearly 16 months of barrages and many strikes against their weapons storage areas in Yemen. Iran's ability to resupply them with critical components for these weapons is also in question after a brutal year for their proxy investments abroad. You can read all about the Houthis anti-ship arsenal here. Adding to the uncertainty of any future U.S. response to the Iranian-backed Houthis, Donald Trump assumed the presidency today. He has previously vowed to revive his 'maximum pressure' campaign against Tehran and its proxies, and when asked about possible military strikes, answered with an ominous 'anything can happen.'

(U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Kaitlin Watt) As we noted in the past, ​​the conflict that began on Oct. 7, 2023 radically reshaped the region’s geopolitics. It saw Israel decimate Hezbollah in Lebanon and by going after proxy groups like these, this has dramatically weakened Iran’s influence over the region, a dynamic reinforced by the fall of the Assad regime in Syria. So, overall, when it comes to the Houthis and the incredibly complex security situation in the region, despite any pledges to the contrary, shipping magnets and military forces alike will very much have to take a 'wait and see' approach to their sudden move towards deescalation.

Nulka Combat Use Shows Warships Need Longer-Lasting Electronic Wa...	The U.S. Navy's use of expendable Nulka decoys in combat has highlighted the need to expand the ability of its ships to launch off-board decoying electronic attacks, including ones lasting tens of minutes or more. Expanded electronic warfare capabilities and capacity could be particularly valuable for helping defend against high-volume attacks, such as barrages of anti-ship cruise missiles or certain kinds of drones. This notably follows the service's announcement last year that one of its top priorities if it had more funding would be accelerating work on a new longer-endurance ship-launched flying decoy drone. Navy Rear Adm. William Daly, head of the Navy’s surface warfare division, talked about combat experience with Nulka and the desire for more off-board electronic attack capabilities during a talk at the Surface Navy Association's main annual symposium last week. A Nulka seen during testing of the Mk 53 MK 53 Decoy Launching System aboard the amphibious assault ship USS America. USN 'We need more off-board electronic EA [electronic attack]. Nulka has demonstrated great performance in combat,' Daly said. 'However, we need longer legs for saturation, to counter saturation rates, and tens of minutes or longer for off-board EA.' In U.S. military parlance, electronic attacks involve use of 'electromagnetic energy to degrade or deny an enemy’s use of the spectrum,' according to a primer from the Congressional Research Service. Nulka decoys are designed to hover in the air for a period of time after launch, but how long exactly they can stay aloft is unclear. The result of a cooperative effort between the United States and Australia, Nulka carries an electronic warfare system that actively produces a signature that mimics that of a large warship to help lure away incoming radar-guided anti-ship cruise missiles. Arleigh Burke class destroyers, Ticonderoga class cruisers, Nimitz class aircraft carriers, America class amphibious assault ships, San Antonio class amphibious warfare ships, and both subclasses are Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) are among the Navy vessels equipped with Nulka. The U.S. Coast Guard's Legend class National Security Cutters and various foreign naval vessels can employ the decoys, as well. In his remarks last week, Rear Adm. Daly did not elaborate on the combat use of Nulka to date or where those employments had occurred. Navy warships capable of employing the decoys have been actively engaged in defending against Houthi missile, drone, and other attacks in and around the Red Sea since October 2023. The Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Mason is also known to have launched Nulkas as part of the response to an earlier cruise missile attack by the Iranian-backed Yemeni militants in 2016. The US Navy's Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Carney fires an SM-2 missile at a Houthi threat in October 2023. USN The US Navy's Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Carney fires an SM-2 missile at Houthi aerial threats on October 19, 2023. USN Regardless, Daly's comments at the Surface Navy Association symposium show that the service has seen enough of what Nulka can do in real combat contexts to highlight the need for more electronic attack capability and capacity. The service's top surface warfare officer also acknowledged work is already underway on systems that could help meet those demands, though he did not provide further details. As already noted, the Navy already has one very relevant program ongoing now, called the Long Endurance Electronic Decoy (LEED). 'The Long Endurance Electronic Decoy (LEED) program will deliver an expendable long endurance autonomous off-board decoy Countermeasure system, comprised of a flight vehicle and Radio Frequency (RF) payload with modular capability allowing for rapid modification of the Electronic Warfare (EW) payload,' according to the service's 2025 Fiscal Year budget request. LEED leverages work dating back to at least 2019 on an earlier effort called the Long Endurance Airborne Platform (LEAP). The latter project is known to have demonstrated a relevant capability using a tube-launched small, low-cost, tube-launched rotary wing drone called the Netted Offboard Miniature Active Decoy (NOMAD). Pictures showing past testing of the Netted Offboard Miniature Active Decoy (NOMAD). USN A trio of pictures showing testing of NOMAD. USN As TWZ has previously written about LEED: 'By all indications, LEED will not only have a longer endurance than Nulka, giving it more time on station and allowing it to operate further away from the ships it is shielding, but it will also have significantly greater autonomous and networked capabilities. If these decoys can operate together in highly autonomous swarms and readily exchange information with other electronic warfare nodes like SEWIP [Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program] systems onboard ships, it will allow them to present much more complex targeting challenges for an opponent and the seekers on their munitions. This could also help expand the total area of coverage offered by these decoys and enable them to rapidly shift focus if new, higher-priority threats appear.' 'Increased endurance and maneuverability will open up the ability for LEEDs to move like the ships that launch them while giving off similar signatures. This, in turn, will allow them to mimic individual vessels or, when working in groups, ghost fleets and do so at extended distances if required. In addition to presenting false targets for incoming missiles, this could confuse and draw away enemy forces who will have to devote extra resources to figuring out where the real threats lie.' A 2017 Navy briefing slide discussing NOMAD. USN USN It is important to stress the valuable additional persistence and flexibility that a drone-like system like LEED would offer, as well as its potential ability to push those capabilities not just off-board, but out to longer distances from the ship. TWZ highlighted these and other benefits in a previous feature laying out a detailed case for equipping Navy warships with swarms of drones capably performing a variety of missions. As Rear Adm. Daly noted last week, a capability like LEED, especially if the decoys can operate in networked swarms, could also help provide greater overall 'saturation' in the face of high-volume attacks, including complex ones involving more than one category of threat (e.g. missiles and kamikaze drones together). Houthi attacks on ships in and around the Red Sea have provided clear examples of the additional challenges defenders face when dealing with incoming ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as drones, simultaneously. If LEED functions, in general terms, akin to Nulka, then its capabilities would at least include the same kind of decoying and spoofing. LEED, which is described as having a modular payload, or other future off-board ship defense systems might incorporate additional electronic warfare capabilities like active jamming. Infrared decoy payloads may also be possible. Infrared sensors are also immune to radio-frequency electronic warfare, in general. LEED is just one known element of a broader Navy push to develop and field an advanced, multi-faceted, cooporative and distributed electronic warfare ecosystem. This larger effort was once referred to as Netted Emulation of Multi-Element Signature against Integrated Sensors, or NEMSIS, which TWZ was the first to report on. Additional known efforts today include other off-board electronic warfare systems like the podded AN/ALQ-248 Advanced Off-Board Electronic Warfare (AOEW) system, which MH-60R/S Seahawk helicopters will carry and that you can read more about here. An MH-60R with an AN/ALQ-248 Advanced Off-Board Electronic Warfare system pod loaded onto its right forward stub wing suspended in the anechoic test chamber at Naval Air Station Patuxent River. USN via Lockheed Martin Navy budget documents had also made clear that LEED, at least, will be directly integrated with electronic warfare suites on the ships that launch them, including variants of the increasingly more capable Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) family. The latest SEWIP Block III system includes its own new and extremely capable electronic attack capability, along with other features TWZ has explored in detail in the past. Navy ships equipped with AN/SPY-1 radars have some additional onboard ability to execute electronic attacks. Certain versions of the AN/SPY-6 radar, which are set to be increasingly common across the service's fleets, will have greater capability in this regard. Various Navy ships have gotten more ad-hoc additional electronic warfare capability in response to specific regional threats in recent years, as well. Other kinds of physical anti-missile decoys, including flares and chaff, are also in Navy service across its fleets. Artwork depicting the SEWIP Block III in action, with an inset image showing part of one of these systems ashore during development. Northrop Grumman Artwork depicting the SEWIP Block III in action, with an inset image showing part of one of these systems ashore during development. Northrop Grumman It is also worth noting here that the Navy is looking at adding high-power microwave (HPM) directed energy weapons to its fleets as another closer-in layer of defense against large cruise missile and drone barrages. The additional layer of point defense that HPMs offer, by extension, is seen as a way to help ships keep higher-end surface-to-air missiles available for use against threats that require their high performance. Of course, there is risk in not killing any threat as far out as possible, but the Navy is already choosing to use its deck guns against less threatening drones. The Navy has also been investing heavily in various tiers of laser directed energy weapons in the past few years for many of the same reasons, but there has been significant criticism about the progress, or lack thereof, on actually fielding those systems. More advanced and longer-endurance expendable decoys could be a boon in this regard, as well. U.S. military operations against the Houthis in and around the Red Sea, as well as in the defense of Israel, in the past year or so, have already highlighted worrisome trends in munitions expenditures and the pipelines for restocking those arsenals, as well as limitations imposed by a lack of at-sea rearming capability. At the SNA symposium last week, Navy Vice Adm. Brendan McLane, head of Naval Surface Forces, disclosed that his service's warships had fired 120 SM-2 missiles, 80 SM-6 missiles, and a combined total of 20 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles (ESSM) and SM-3 missiles, as well as 160 five-inch shells, in the course of these operations around the Middle East. Lessons learned from the recent Red Sea fight have already led to more than one crash Navy program to expand the ability of its ships, as well as aircraft, to better engage aerial threats. Combat experience with Nulka is now also providing new impetus for increasing off-board electronic attack capabilities available to Navy ships.

Russian BTR-82 Had A Spectacular Misfire On The Battlefield In Uk...	A dramatic video has appeared showing a Russian BTR-82 8&#215;8 armored personnel carrier firing its main gun wildly, spitting dozens of shells in one fiery burst, apparently due to a technical malfunction after the vehicle was reportedly struck by a Ukrainian drone. While huge numbers of this particular model of BTR have been lost in Russian hands since the start of the full-scale invasion, this is certainly one of the most bizarre sequences we’ve seen of the vehicle in combat. The cannon of the Russian BTR-82 starts shooting spontaneously after being hit by a drone.&mdash; Special Kherson Cat (@specialkhersoncat.bsky.social) 2025-01-19T21:26:09.612Z The BTR-82 follows the same format as the Cold War-era BTR-80 and typically accommodates up to three crew and seven troops. The standard armored personnel carrier variant weighs 16 tons and has a top speed on improved roads of between 50 and 60 miles per hour, and it has also spawned a wide range of variants and specialized vehicles. The BTR-82 is highly mobile, with an amphibious capability using waterjet propulsion. The video in question is edited together using footage from at least two drones, one of them providing overwatch and the other apparently a weaponized first-person view (FPV) drone. At the start of the sequence, smoke can be seen coming from the left rear corner of the BTR, which stands stationary in a field. Some of the hatches are already open, suggesting that members of the crew have escaped, or are about to. Smoke emanates from the rear right-hand part of the BTR-82 in the first part of the video. via X It’s worth noting that this particular BTR has some visible anti-drone protections, including two ‘cope cages,’ which are also festooned with netting. One of these is located over the gun mounting on top of the turret. Slat armor is also fitted around the sides of the hull. Cope cages, which you can read more about here, are a familiar feature on all kinds of vehicles in the Ukraine war, providing a physical barrier against drone impacts and entering the vehicle itself, especially in the more vulnerable areas of the turret and the hull. Slat armor, meanwhile, provides additional protection against projectiles approaching the front, sides, and rear of the vehicle, typically rocket-propelled grenades and similar anti-armor weapons. The next view, from the FPV drone, shows it approaching the vehicle, although we don't see it actually enter the hull. It’s not clear if the BTR was already smoking at this point, having been hit by a previous drone, or having received some other kind of fire. It could also be that these two parts of the video are provided out of sequence, with this FPV drone footage having been captured before the vehicle started to smoke. Imagery captured from an FPV drone, which may have entered the open hatch in the vehicle a moment later. via X Regardless, at this point, the BTR-82's main gun, which is in a raised position, begins to fire. It remains firing, without pause, for a full 20 seconds, leaving the vehicle cloaked in smoke. The main weapon of the BTR-82 is a 2A72 autocannon in 30mm. This is a light development of the widely used 2A42, which arms the BMP-2 infantry combat vehicle, BMD-2 and BMD-3 airborne combat vehicles, the BTR-90 armored personnel carrier, as well as the Ka-52 and Mi-28 attack helicopters.

This is a notably faster rate of fire than the already impressive 200 rounds per minute achieved by the rapid-fire Bushmaster chain gun, as used on the M2 Bradley infantry combat vehicle, which is used by Ukraine. Against soft targets, such as infantry, the effective range of the gun is increased to around 1.2 miles. Ammunition options include armor-piercing-tracer (AP-T), high-explosive fragmentation-incendiary (HEF-I), and high-explosive-tracer (HE-T) ammunition. The BTR-82 normally carries 300 rounds of 30mm ammunition, so we are not seeing the full load being fired here, although it’s still a significant salvo. It’s also not clear what kind of effect this sustained burst of fire might have had on the gun, its mounting, and ancillary equipment. Although designed for prolonged firing, the gun is air-cooled, meaning that extensive sustained use could cause it to overheat or cause other damage.

The fate of the BTR-82 in the video also remains unclear, but at the very least it would appear to have been severely damaged. Further fires or detonations could have been catastrophic and there’s always the possibility that it could have been targeted by further FPV drone strikes. According to the Oryx open-source tracking group, which only records losses for which it has visual confirmation, Russia has seen more than a thousand BTR-82 series vehicles, including the more modern BTR-82AT, destroyed, abandoned, or captured since the start of the full-scale invasion.

Photo by Aleksandr Gusev/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images SOPA Images Losses like these have, in part, prompted Russia to deploy some much older armored personnel carriers in the conflict, including the tracked BTR-50, which first entered Soviet service in 1954. These ancient vehicles began to be noted in the context of the war in Ukraine in early 2023 and now are a more common sight in the fighting. While the web is flooded with AI-generated images of non-existent Russian futuristic tanks, museum pieces like these two BTR-50, in service since 1954, are increasingly being spotted on the front lines. t.me/mag_vodogray&#8230;&mdash; Special Kherson Cat (@specialkhersoncat.bsky.social) 2025-01-18T14:28:50.391Z Ultimately, the BTR-82’s unplanned long burst of cannon fire may have been an unusual anomaly, but the vehicle — provided it was eventually destroyed — can be added to a huge and growing number of the type that has been lost in Ukraine.

Older Destroyers Taking On Navy Air Defense Commander Role As Cru...	As the U.S. Navy waits for more of its Flight III Arleigh Burke class destroyers to join the fleet, the existing Flight IIA DDGs will increasingly be taking on the air defense commander role in a carrier strike group (CSG) that has long been served by the aging Ticonderoga class cruiser fleet. The Navy has four variants in its workhorse guided-missile destroyer fleet: Flight I, Flight II, Flight IIA and Flight III. Flight IIIs will one day take over the air defense commander mission as they were designed specifically accommodate it, but to date, just one, the USS Jack H. Lucas (DDG-125), has been commissioned into service. As a result, the Flight IIAs will increasingly be handling a CSG’s air defense command mission as the Navy’s cruiser fleet retires. Unlike destroyers taking on traditional missions that are often skippered by O-5 rank commanders, air defense DDGs will be helmed by O-6 rank captains, as cruisers are, reflecting the heightened import of that mission. The USS Jack H. Lucas (DDG-125), the first of the Flight III destroyers. (USN) A warship serving as a CSG air defense commander is responsible for tracking of any and all objects in the sky for the CSG, and coordinating actions across the CSG to investigate and, if need be, neutralize those threats. They are the nerve center of the air warfare fight and have the ability to use all the air defense assets in the CSG to achieve their objectives. The cruisers traditionally undertaking such missions have a larger Combat Information Center (CIC) with more watch standers, as well as expanded hardware. Advances in destroyer hardware and the ever-evolving Aegis Combat System mean that the Flight IIAs are up to taking over the task, as the Navy intends, even if some compromises are made and taking on more crew, resulting in closer quarters. Check out TWZ's past reporting on how these CICs have been tested like never before in the Red Sea. A Combat Information Center (CIC) aboard a modernized Navy Ticonderoga class cruiser is significantly larger than those found on Alreigh Burke class destroyers, which were never intended to fulfill the air defense command role. (USN) (U.S. Navy) 'As we get the Flight IIIs online, we will gradually transition to that,' the head of Naval Surface Force Atlantic, Rear Adm. Joseph Cahill, told TWZ and other reporters by phone during a roundtable conversation at the Surface Navy Associations conference last week. 'But we had a gap in there that we needed to fill and [using Flight IIAs for air defense commander is] how we filled it. We think that’s going pretty well from an execution standpoint, but we do need to keep our eye close on that and keep really managing that talent.' This year will feature Flight IIAs increasingly serving in that air defense commander role, with each of the Navy’s 11 CSGs eventually having their own DDG undertaking that mission. Surface fleet brass say they’ve been encouraged by the DDGs that conducted that mission for two carrier strike groups last year as well. USS Cowpens (CG-63) firing a volley of Standard surface-to-air missiles. (USN) The USS Frank E. Peterson Jr. (DDG-121) deployed with the USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72) Carrier Strike Group (CSG) last year, serving as air defense commander. Meanwhile, fellow Flight IIA destroyer USS Daniel Inouye (DDG-118) handled the air defense commander role for the USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71) CSG last year as well. Daniel Inouye trained for that role before deployment and then took on the mission after the strike group’s cruiser dropped out for 'material reasons,' according to Vice Adm. Brendan McLane, the head of Naval Surface Forces. While McLane didn’t identify the Theodore Roosevelt CSG cruiser by name, online reports indicate that USS Lake Erie (CG-70) was the cruiser that could not make the deployment. Still, McLane said, Daniel Inouye performed the role well after the cruiser’s air defense team was moved over to the destroyer. 'So that team was around the commanding officer, enabled to do it,' he said. 'And what I can tell you is both turned out really well. I was happy, and the feedback that we got from the strike group commander on Frank E. Peterson was that, really, you couldn’t tell the difference. And with Daniel Inouye, even though it was a short-notice change, it was the same. They did very, very well.' Both warships trained for that contingency before deployment commenced, he said. The aging cruiser fleet has suffered readiness issues and what outside analysts have called a botched modernization effort that resulted in billions spent for very little extended cruiser service life. Go here to read more TWZ coverage of those issues. While details remain scant, a deployed cruiser, USS Gettysburg (CG-64), was at the center of a friendly fire incident last month, when the cruiser shot down a F/A-18 Super Hornet jet while deployed with the USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75) in the Red Sea. That ship, while just a handful of years before the end of its service life, had been recently upgraded and is the most advanced of its kind at sea today. Flight operations aboard the USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75) in December. (USN) (U.S. Navy) For the interim time between the last of the cruisers retiring and the Flight III DDGs coming online, the Navy plans to have one Flight IIA destroyer serving as air defense commander in each of its 11 carrier strike groups. The USS Winston S. Churchill (DDG-81) will deploy this summer with the USS George H.W. Bush (CVN-77) Carrier Strike Group, Cahill said, and the USS Mason (DDG-87) is preparing to take on that role as well. Navy leadership have not identified the other vessels slated to take on air defense commander. 'The warships that we've selected that are Flight II Alphas have all been modernized and have the latest threat-based capability out there, so that's another important piece on this,' Cahill said. 'These integrated air and missile defense commanders have incredibly potent and lethal combat systems.' Meanwhile, other Flight IIAs are undergoing other modernization efforts to upgrade their capability and extend their service life, a development that TWZ has covered extensively in the past. Such Flight IIAs are up to the air defense command ship task, but the decision raises questions about long-term feasibility, according to a retired warship captain who requested anonymity to share his frank thoughts on the matter with TWZ. The Navy Flight IIA destroyer USS Mason (DDG 87). (USN) (U.S. Navy) Equipment-wise, a DDG can accommodate the extra staff required to take on the air defense mission, which involves a handful of additional watch stations in the warship’s Combat Information Center (CIC). 'You’ve got extra people and need to put them somewhere, so that could be a hassle, but you’ve got room,' the retired captain said. Still, tasking a Flight IIA destroyer with the air defense commander mission means the CSG has one less warship available for other missions, he said. Flight IIA manning documents also don’t include the required extra people, so that could portend long-term alterations to the ship’s manning. 'It adds another layer and brings up the ops tempo a bit for everybody on the ship,' he said, adding that every other CSG warfare commander is stationed on the aircraft carrier, and that there’s been debate in the community for a long time about whether the air defense commander mission should be run from a flattop as well. 'From a capability standpoint, with a few tweaks, the Flight II Alphas can do the job,' he said. This mission shift for the Flight IIAs is being driven by the fact that the Navy is waiting on its Flight III destroyers to come online en masse. Navy officials have not responded to TWZ questions about the status of that effort, and when more of those new DDGs will be joining the fleet, but analyses and other reporting indicate that the Flight IIIs are suffering cost increases and delivery delays. The Navy currently has 74 destroyers in the Arleigh Burke class. Two Flight IIAs and 18 Flight IIIs are already either under construction or their purchase has already been authorized by Congress. A Congressional Budget Office (CBO) assessment released earlier this month also found that, overall, the 23 Flight IIIs laid out in the Navy’s most recent 30-year shipbuilding plan will end up costing $2.7 billion on average, up from prior estimates of $2.1 billion per ship. 'The Navy stated in a briefing to CBO and [the Congressional Research Service] that the increase in its estimates of the cost of the DDG-51 Flight IIIs was attributable to shipbuilding inflation’s outpacing economywide inflation as well as declining shipyard performance,' the CBO report states. The report added that the destroyers currently under construction 'have experienced substantial delays.' To date, just one Flight III destroyer, the USS Jack Lucas (DDG-125) has been commissioned, and the keel was laid for the second Flight III, the future USS Louis H. Wilson Jr. (DDG-126) in 2023. The future USS Ted Stevens (DDG-128) was also launched in 2023. Inside Defense reported in June that other Flight III vessels could see six-to-25-month delivery delays. #GeneralDynamics Bath Iron Works Begins Construction of #USNavy Flight III Arleigh Burke Class Destroyer Future USS Louis H. Wilson Jr. #DDG126 #BIW pic.twitter.com/m5kaB3hP8Y&mdash; DefPost (@defpostmedia) March 5, 2020 TWZ reported on various aspects of that CBO assessment, which questioned cost and fleet size estimates by the Navy for the coming decades. While Navy leaders have expressed confidence that Flight IIA destroyers can handle the air defense mission as the sea service waits for Flight IIIs, the stopgap solution nonetheless reflects longstanding issues that the sea service and the American shipbuilding industry face when it comes to purchasing and delivering warships on time. And while legislative and other efforts are underway to potentially fix these shortfalls, it remains to be seen whether U.S. shipbuilding can be put on a better course.

Drone Boats Being Rushed To Help Prevent Baltic Seafloor Cable Sa...	In the coming weeks, uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) will join NATO’s new Baltic Sentry effort to protect power and communications cables running under the Baltic Sea, some of which have recently been sabotaged. The USVs, also known as drone boats, will help establish an enhanced common operating picture to give participating nations a better sense of potential threats and speed up any response. It is the first time NATO will use USVs in this manner, said a top alliance commander. #NATO is ready to defend critical underwater infrastructure in the #BalticSea. Op #BalticSentry deploys #SNMG1 & #SNMCMG1, maritime patrol aircraft & naval drones to increase our understanding of the maritime environment, improving Allies’ ability to deter, defend & respond to… pic.twitter.com/B0SwtkLLQZ&mdash; NATO Maritime Command (@NATO_MARCOM) January 17, 2025 NATO’s Allied Command Transformation (ACT) 'will bring some new [USVs] at the speed of light,' said French Adm Pierre Vandier, the Supreme Allied Commander Transformation (SACT). 'So, I expect that in less than a few weeks, we will bring that to (Allied Marine Command) MARCOM and then we will begin to use these ships to give a persistent, 24-7 surveillance of critical areas.' The plan is to create 'a single network' combing 'all the picture[s], all the video, the [Integrated Automation System] IAS, the picture on a radar picture,' and then share the resulting data 'with all stakeholders,' Vandier said Thursday evening after a meeting of NATO defense chiefs. 'It will give quicker forensic and quicker hints for action for the multiple stakeholders whether they are industry or Coast Guard or National Police.' The effort 'is the first time we bring this as an operational experiment in answer to an operational problem,' the admiral added. There will be at least 20 USVs assigned to Baltic Sentry, a NATO spokesman told The War Zone Friday afternoon. ACT and NATO’s Allied Command Operations are 'finalizing the specific capabilities required,' he added. 'Those requirements will focus on delivering situational awareness, through largely passive sensors (including imagery and the electromagnetic spectrum) and generating the necessary number of platforms to cover the areas of interest,' he explained. 'The initiative foresees the fleet evolving over phases, allowing for the opportunities to scale the effort, integrate new or different technologies, and broaden the operational domains.' The exact types of USVs are still to be determined, the official said. A Common Unmanned Surface Vehicle (CUSV) from the US Navy moves past a Spanish Navy P45 patrol vessel during sea trials as part of NATO Exercise REPMUS 22. (NATO) In the first phase of the experiment, the USVs will 'have the capabilities under human control' while 'later phases will include greater autonomy.' The USVs will augment the dozen or so vessels as well as an unspecified number of crewed maritime patrol aircraft committed to Baltic Sentry, which was unveiled earlier this week. It was formed in the wake of the suspected sabotage last month of undersea power and communications cables between Finland and Estonia. According to Finnish authorities, the Russian-linked Eagle S oil tanker severed the Estlink 2 undersea power cable and four telecommunications cables with its anchor. The ship, found to be brimming with spy equipment, was seized and authorities are continuing their investigation. You can see that ship after it was seized by Finnish authorites in the following video. The suspected sabotage of the Estlink 2 power cable is the most recent of several such incidents in the region. In November, Germany said damage to two communication cables running under the Baltic Sea was most likely the result of sabotage. The two cables in question are both fiber-optic communication cables, running along the Baltic seabed. One runs between the Swedish island of Gotland and Lithuania, and the other between Finland and Germany. Gotland is about 280 miles southwest of where the Estlink 2 cable was severed. A day later, Denmark confirmed it was monitoring a Chinese cargo vessel at the center of allegations surrounding that damage. The 735-foot-long Yi Peng 3 was identified as operating near the cables when the incidents occurred. The Chinese vessel had departed the Russian port of Ust-Luga, in the Leningrad region, close to the Estonian border, on Nov. 15 and had been scheduled to sail to Port Said, Egypt, where it was originally due to arrive on Dec. 3. Earlier this week, Swedish Defense Minister Carl-Oskar Bohlin announced that the Norbalt undersea power cable linking Sweden with Lithuania was likely also purposely damaged by the Yi Peng 3 as well. The vessel is currently transiting the Red Sea. Officials suspect the Yi Peng 3 of severing at least three cables running underneath the Baltic Sea. (Photo by Mikkel Berg Pedersen / Ritzau Scanpix / AFP) / Denmark) MIKKEL BERG PEDERSEN 'We are determined to deter, detect and counter any attempts at sabotage,' read a joint statement by the leaders of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Sweden that announced Baltic Sentry. 'Any attack against our infrastructure will be met with a robust and determined response. We stand ready to attribute hostile actions committed by malign actors, as appropriate.' In their statement, the leaders singled out Russia and its shadow fleet of oil tankers for creating security and environmental problems around the world. 'This reprehensible practice also threatens the integrity of undersea infrastructure, increases risks connected to sea-dumped chemical munitions, and significantly supports funding of Russia’s illegal war of aggression against Ukraine.' Baltic Sentry is the latest effort to defend against the Russian shadow fleet. Nordic Warden, 'an advanced UK-led reaction system to track potential threats to undersea infrastructure and monitor the Russian shadow fleet, following reported damage to a major undersea cable in the Baltic Sea,' was launched earlier this month, the U.K. Defense Ministry (MoD) announced. The system was set up to protect critical undersea infrastructure and 'harnesses AI to assess data from a range of sources, including the Automatic Identification System (AIS) ships use to broadcast their position, to calculate the risk posed by each vessel entering areas of interest,' according to the MoD. 'The…action reinforces existing and planned NATO responses.' Nordic Warden is a U.K.-led effort to counter Russia's shadow fleet. (Forsvaret) USVs gained global recognition from the war in Ukraine, which has used them to devastating effect as strike weapons against Russia in the Black Sea region. However, their use as reconnaissance and surveillance tools is also being evaluated by the U.S. and other navies, like China’s. American USVs of various types have played an increasing role in keeping tabs on ship movements and other actions, as well as taking part in major exercises, in the Middle East, for instance, under the Navy’s Task Force 59. The Baltic Sentry USV experiment will be closely watched to see how its autonomous operations and sensing capabilities work under a very real-world, high-profile use case. The data provided by these systems won’t just help counter sabotage threats in those waters, it will also provide greater insights into the benefits and challenges of operating these systems over extended periods.

Navy To Simplify Drone Ship Plans, Focus On Containerized Payload...	After spending years charting a way forward to a family of unmanned surface vessels in a specific array of sizes and configurations, the Navy is eyeing a major course alteration that would see it pursuing a simpler and more interchangeable design. According to Rear Adm. William Daly, head of the Navy's surface warfare division (N96), the wish list is now simple: he wants to amass a large number of these unmanned boats quickly and equip them with payloads that fit in common containers and are designed to confuse the enemy. 'The optionally crewed future needs to arrive sooner,' Daly told an audience Tuesday at the Surface Navy Association's annual symposium just outside Washington, D.C. 'N96's focus now is to move faster and streamline the family of unmanned surface crafts. The change from what you've heard earlier is that we are not pursuing large, medium … more directly, a hybrid fleet need not include large and/or exquisite uncrewed platforms. We've got to get real here.' The US Navy's Seahawk, an existing MUSV design in the service's inventory. USN Chief Petty Officer Shannon Renfroe Rather than the array of large and medium designs that had been previously planned, Daly said, the Navy needs a single solution that can meet the needs that both were intended to fill while remaining inexpensive and 'non-exquisite.' 'It can come off multiple production lines in an identical manner and go towards one of two payloads,' Daly said: a weapons payload for the originally charted large unmanned surface vessel (LUSV) mission, and an intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) payload for the medium USV (MUSV) mission. Mariner, at rear, and Ranger, in the foreground, which are two of the larger USVs that the Navy has been experimenting with for several years now. USN As recently as the fiscal year 2025 budget request, the Navy had unique specifications for its large and medium USV programs, calling for an LUSV up to 300 feet long with a displacement of up to 2,000 tons that could be outfitted with payloads for anti-surface warfare and strike and carry a vertical launch system (VLS) with as many as 32 cells. According to a Congressional Research Service report updated in December, the Navy's budget plans had the first LUSV purchase taking place in fiscal 2027 at an estimated cost of $497.6 million, with procurement of the next two the following year at about $326 million apiece. Medium USVs, which the Navy had described as under 200 feet long and displacing less than 500 tons, were to have a mission more focused on ISR, with planned payloads supporting ISR and targeting, counter-ISR and targeting (counter-ISR&T), and information operations missions. The most recent budget did not include procurement of any MUSVs before fiscal 2029. The Navy has two medium-sized USVs, the Sea Hunter and Seahawk, which it has been using as testbeds for years now. Sea Hunter was originally developed for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Anti-Submarine Warfare Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel (ACTUV) project. The Navy's large USV plans have received attention and scrutiny thanks to the Defense Department's Ghost Fleet Overlord program, which involved designs originally developed by the Pentagon's Strategic Capabilities Office. Those ships were transferred to the Navy in 2022 for further experimentation and development and additional examples have been acquired since then. While the vessels were involved in a series of successful tests, including one Pacific transit in which the USV Nomad traveled 4,421 nautical miles and spent 98% of the voyage in autonomous mode, skeptics have also emerged. The Navy put Nomad up for auction last year and the current status of that particular ship is unclear. The Nomad USV. USN After Iran briefly seized two smaller Navy Saildrone Explorer USVs in late 2022, Elaine Luria, then a Democratic Party Representative from Virginia, as well as a veteran Navy officer, criticized the service's vision for the platforms, saying it had not been clearly articulated to Congress and that the technology was not mature enough to handle 'the maintenance challenges of operating at sea and transiting long distances.' Daly's vision, as presented this week would move the service toward a common unmanned craft that could fill both the targeting and ISR roles, at least initially. 'The designs already exist, and we must not over-spec this,' he said Tuesday. 'We've also had sufficient funding and experimentation to date to know what we need.' Daly said the vessel he envisioned was at the formerly specified higher range of a MUSV – so, about 200 feet – and capable of holding up to four 40-foot payload containers. US Navy Adm. Daryl Caudle, head of U.S. Fleet Forces Command, gestures at USV designs, including a concept depicted carrying a containerized payload, at defense contractor Leidos' booth at the 2025 Surface Navy Association symposium on January 15, 2024. USN 'Many of the payloads are ready and tested. [Concepts of operation] are coalescing,' he said. 'Let's move faster. This is efficient, this is effective, and this is scalable.' As noted here, Navy LUSV and MUSV-related testing to date has included a number of containerized payloads. The most notable of these is the four-cell Mk 70 Expeditionary Launcher, also known as the Payload Delivery System. The Mk 70 is derived from the Mk 41 VLS and can fire missiles like the multi-purpose Standard Missile-6 (SM-6) and Tomahawk cruise missile. See the game-changing, cross-domain, cross-service concepts the Strategic Capabilities Office and @USNavy are rapidly developing: an SM-6 launched from a modular launcher off of USV Ranger. Such innovation drives the future of joint capabilities. #DoDInnovates pic.twitter.com/yCG57lFcNW&mdash; Department of Defense (@DeptofDefense) September 3, 2021 Daly also emphasized that he wanted the containers to look identical from the outside, thwarting the ability of adversaries to determine the threat level via ISR drones or other visual reconnaissance. In the future, he said, he expects the payloads that USVs and other platforms carry to get more diverse and include laser weapons and high-powered microwaves. 'What's in the box, a weapon or a different payload?' he said. 'Keep them guessing.' In a conversation with reporters on Wednesday, Daly said experimentation under the Ghost Fleet Overlord program and subsequent efforts, including the deployment of four USVs together in the Pacific region in 2023, had all proven the capability of the systems. Practicalities of shipyard production and manning had also driven thinking toward a less exquisite, more universal USV solution. The Navy's USVs Ranger, in the background, and Seahawk, in the foreground, in Sydney Harbor in Australia during the 2023 deployment. USN 'Technology was also part of that, meaning containerized solutions for a lot of things have really matured over the last five-ish years,' he said. With the roughly $500 million that Congress had programmed for medium and large USV development since fiscal 2021, 'it was critical for me to be able to show that all of the learning with that technology, all those other assumptions … enabled us to get to this solution, this feasible, producible at-scale solution.' Compared with the LUSV acquisition cost estimates from the fiscal 2025 budget, Daly said he thinks he can get his more generic USVs at around $50 million per copy. The strategy will have to get support from Congress, he said, and the Navy also has critical decisions to make around how to man USVs for support and maintenance, where to homeport them, and how to employ them in the fleets. Asked by TWZ about the next steps for developing modular containerized payloads, Daly stressed that he didn't want to 'over-spec' the development process. In addition to containerized directed-energy weapons as a future payload, which could mean a laser or a high-power microwave, Daly said counter-ISR&T packages may also be in the mix. What systems might fill that latter role is unclear, but an electronic warfare suite might be one option. The video below shows a previous test of a Navy laser directed energy weapon installed on the San Antonio class amphibious warfare ship USS Portland. Citing Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti's 2027 target for increasing readiness across the force and meeting a new 80% surge goal, Daly said he wanted to see the payloads readied in the next two years, though the fleets would have a say on timing. 'We are all trying to provide [Franchetti] options for pre-2027, and there are ISR-related and weapons-related options that could be met before 2027, let's put it that way,' he said. Daly's planning – which will have to be endorsed in future Navy budget requests to firm up the way forward on USVs – also requires a more comprehensive vision from the service on how to employ the vessels and integrate them into the fleet. While previous studies have called for up to 153 large USVs, the service still seems to be grappling with a holistic concept of operations: when the ships will be unmanned versus optionally manned, how they'll work alongside manned vessels, where they can assume some of the burden of manned ships, and what employment might look like in combat, among other things. Unlike with some programs, the Navy does not have a dedicated resource sponsor for unmanned surface vessels, although USVs were mentioned frequently by service leaders throughout the SNA symposium. Daly said the Navy to start building and doing things with USVs, even as concepts of operations were still 'coalescing.' 'Skepticism of the system on analyzing this forever and making it too exquisite is a motivation for me,' he said.

France Decries Russian S-400 Radar Locking Onto Its Maritime Patr...	A French Navy Atlantique 2 maritime patrol aircraft was illuminated by the fire-control radar of a Russian long-range air defense system, while flying over the Baltic Sea earlier this week, according to France’s Minister of the Armed Forces Sébastien Lecornu. The incident is the latest to occur in a highly strategic region in which NATO and Russian assets closely monitor each other, and which has seen a recent spate of suspected sabotage of undersea infrastructure. This has occurred as NATO officials increasingly warn of the threat of Russian ‘hybrid warfare’ tactics here and elsewhere in Europe. 'On Wednesday night, a French Atlantique 2 maritime patrol aircraft was the target of Russian intimidation,' Lecornu said, in a statement issued today on X. 'It was patrolling in international airspace over the Baltic Sea as part of a NATO operation and was illuminated by the fire-control radar of an S-400 ground-based air defense system. This aggressive Russian action is unacceptable. Our armed forces will continue to act to defend freedom of navigation in international air and sea spaces,' he added.

Guillaume Vernet, a spokesman for the French Armed Forces. 'The professional attitude of the crew prevented any escalation.' Additional reports suggest that as well as being locked on by the fire-control radar, the Atlantique 2 was subjected to some kind of jamming by the Russian Armed Forces. The Atlantique 2 was flying from its home base at Lann-Bihoué in Brittany, northern France, and reportedly flew a route that took it off the coast of Sweden and other countries in the Baltic. While the Atlantique 2 began its service life primarily as an anti-submarine warfare platform, its mission spectrum has increased considerably in more recent years, as you can read about here.

In its current configuration, the twin-engine turboprop boasts a Thales Searchmaster active electronically scanned array (AESA) surveillance radar, a forward-looking infrared (FLIR) camera under the nose, an MX-20 sensor turret with electro-optical and infrared cameras below the rear fuselage, a magnetic anomaly detector (MAD) in the tail for acquiring submerged submarines, and wingtip electronic support measures (ESM) pods to intercept radio transmissions. The aircraft has a mission crew of 10 sensor operators, plus another four in the cockpit. The MX-20 sensor turret under the rear fuselage of an Atlantique 2. Dassault Aviation With a range of 4,300 nautical miles and an endurance of 14 hours, the Atlantique 2 is an ideal surveillance asset and can even conduct strike missions overland. 'We are the only French aircraft equipped with so much imagery and electromagnetic surveillance kit and able to stay in the area for so long — up to 14 hours on task,' the commanding officer of one of the two Atlantique 2 squadrons told AirForces Monthly in 2019. 'That allows us to assess information, to reinforce it, to make sure that it’s a target that needs dealing with and to release weapons.'

Photo by FRED TANNEAU/AFP via Getty Images It’s unclear exactly where the incidents occurred, but it seems almost certain that the French Navy aircraft was in international airspace close to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The Baltic is a routine operating area for the Atlantique 2 and other NATO maritime patrol and surveillance aircraft, from where they ensure the safety of navigation as well as keep tabs on Russian naval and air movements and activities on the ground in Kaliningrad, which is sandwiched between NATO members Poland and Lithuania. A map of the Baltic region including Kaliningrad. Google Earth The heavily militarized exclave is a key area of interest to NATO. As well as hosting the headquarters of the Russian Navy’s Baltic Fleet, it also has important military air bases and serves as something of a missile bastion for Russia. It is home to ground-launched Iskander short-range ballistic missiles and has temporarily hosted Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missiles launched by MiG-31 Foxhound interceptors. In the past, there has also been speculation that Russia might deploy the 9M729 ground-launched cruise missile (SSC-8 Screwdriver) there. This controversial weapon violated the terms of the now-defunct Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, according to U.S. officials, and led to the United States withdrawing from that treaty. Russian soldiers sit on the launcher of Tochka-M short-range ballistic missile, prior to its launch at a military training ground in the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. STRINGER/AFP via Getty Images STRINGER As to the S-400, this long-range air defense system has been deployed to Kaliningrad in the past, although in late 2023 it was reported that at least some of the systems, or components of them, had been moved from the exclave, likely for use in the war in Ukraine. However, the system involved in the incident this week wouldn’t necessarily have had to be in Kaliningrad to have illuminated the French Navy aircraft. With a claimed range of over 200 miles, the fire-control radar could also have been located in Belarus and illuminated the aircraft off the coast of Kaliningrad, or it could have been stationed in the vicinity of St. Petersburg, provided the Atlantique 2 was operating at the eastern end of the Baltic, flying off the coast of Finland or Estonia. Either way, the fact that a radar associated with the S-400 locked on to the Atlantique 2 will likely have provided very useful intelligence for the French Navy. Using its ESM equipment, the aircraft may have been able to eavesdrop on communications between Russian air defense operators as well as gain a better understanding of the S-400 and how it’s used. At the very least, the mission crew aboard the French aircraft should have been able to locate where the threatening radio-frequency emission was coming from, establishing the location of the S-400 and the type of radar used.

ANDREY SMIRNOV/AFP via Getty Images ANDREY SMIRNOV As well as routine intelligence-gathering flights in the region, maritime patrol and surveillance of the region have been stepped up in the wake of reported sabotage incidents that have targeted undersea cables in the Baltic. Most notably, in December, undersea cables between Estonia and Finland were damaged, with the suspected culprit vessel, the Eagle S, reportedly being extensively outfitted with espionage equipment. The Swedish Navy ship HSwMS Belos found the anchor of the Eagle S, a Russian-linked oil tanker suspected of severing Estlink 2 four undersea telecom cables in December. Finnish Navy As we reported recently, the newly created Baltic Sentry mission, which began this week, is dedicated to the protection of critical underwater infrastructure in this region. Speaking to TWZ earlier this month, a NATO naval spokesman said: 'We’ve had persistent military presence in the Baltic Sea and that is something that will continue in full support of our Baltic allies. We will continue to work with our allies to determine options and assets to maintain an enduring military presence.' In addition, Russia has been accused of conducting large-scale jamming of GPS navigation in the Baltic region for some time now. Russian GPS jamming has been reported in the Baltic since at least 2017 and last year, U.K. authorities confirmed that a Royal Air Force Dassault 900LX business jet transporting the U.K. defense secretary experienced GPS jamming while flying near Kaliningrad. Russia has been accused of using similar tactics to target military aircraft elsewhere in Europe, too. GPS systems are widely used for accurate aircraft navigation, increasing safety and efficiency, with most aircraft having backup systems if the GPS is lost. For its part, Russia has a wide array of man-portable and vehicle-mounted electronic warfare systems that are reportedly capable of jamming transmissions and even feeding false information into networks, including 'spoofing' GPS signals and potentially sending parties and vehicles off their intended course. A Russian Krasukha-4 mobile electronic warfare system. It is reportedly able to target spy satellites, ground-based radars, and airborne early warning systems. Russian Ministry of Defense While the Baltic region has long been the backdrop for sometimes tense interactions between NATO and Russian military assets, the war in Ukraine and the recent incidents of apparent sabotage on the seabed have increased the focus on this area and officials are now speaking more frequently and openly about the Kremlin’s nefarious intentions here and elsewhere. Yesterday, Gen. Christopher G. Cavoli, Commander, U.S. European Command, and Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), said that Russian interference of aircraft 'is widespread,' extends 'far beyond' European borders, and 'is something that is quite serious,' affecting all kinds of aircraft, both military and civilian. In the Baltic region specifically, there seems little prospect of this kind of interference diminishing. Although using an air defense radar to illuminate a NATO aircraft in international waters is a provocative action, it’s not the first time that Russia has used belligerent tactics over these waters and will almost certainly not be the last.

Littoral Combat Ship Can Now Rapidly Shoot Down Aerial Drones Wit...	The U.S. Navy carried out a crash program last year to enable Freedom class littoral combat ships (LCS) armed with radar-guided AGM-114L Longbow Hellfire missiles to fire those weapons against uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) — in other words, drones. This came in direct response to concerns about Houthi drone threats to American warships operating in and around the Red Sea. Hints at the new counter-drone capability from the Freedom class LCSs first emerged at the Surface Navy Association's main annual symposium earlier this week. The Navy responded to TWZ's queries for more information sent on January 15 by directing us to a press release put out the following day. The USS Indianapolis is the first Freedom class LCS to have gotten this counter-drone upgrade, which it received in the course of operations in the Middle East last fall. Indianapolis was deployed between March and November 2024, during which time it also operated in the Atlantic Ocean and around Europe. Indianapolis is also the first LCS from either the Freedom or Independence classes to receive a Combat Action Ribbon, which we will come back to later on. A stock picture of the USS Indianapolis. USN 'In Fall 2024, the [Navy’s Littoral Combat Ship Mission Modules] program [office] upgraded both the software and hardware of the Surface-to-Surface Missile Module (SSMM) to enhance the ship’s defense posture while on deployment,' according to a Navy release. 'This rapid deployment of C-UAS [counter-uncrewed aerial systems] capability underscores the flexibility of SSMM in addressing a range of threats, including surface, land, and aerial challenges.' Enlisted technicians from the Navy Munitions Command (NMC) Bahrain Detachment support the delivery of hardware and software upgrades aboard USS Indianapolis (LCS 17) in September 2024 while the ship was forward deployed to the U.S. 5th Fleet Area of Responsibility. USN The main element of the SSMMs are launchers that can be loaded with up to 24 AGM-114Ls at a time. Unlike many other Hellfire variants, the Longbow Hellfire features millimeter wave radar rather than laser guidance. One LCSs, the ship's radar cues the missiles to their targets and the seeker's on the missile lock on and destroy their assigned targets autonomously. The SSMM reached initial operational capability on Freedom class LCSs in 2019. The same year, the Navy began testing the module on Independence class LCSs. 'Recent events in the U.S. 5th Fleet Area of Responsibility (AoR) underscore the importance of equipping our warships with up-to-date C-UAS systems to keep emerging threats at bay,' Navy Capt. Matthew Lehmann, head of the LCS Mission Modules program office, said in a statement. 'By leveraging the adaptability of proven technologies &#8230; we were able to deliver on a critical need to the Fleet. This accomplishment showcases the ingenuity and resourcefulness of the Littoral Combat Ship Mission Module Program.' 'This rapid integration of C-UAS capabilities enhances our ability to project power and maintain freedom of maneuver in contested environments,' Rear. Adm. Kevin Smith, Program Executive Officer for Unmanned and Small Combatants at Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), also said in a statement. 'By equipping LCS with advanced, flexible systems like the SSMM, we are not only addressing immediate threats but also strengthening the Navy's overall strategy for operational agility, deterrence, and sustained dominance in littoral regions.' The main purpose of the SSMM initially was to give Freedom or Independence-class LCSs additional capacity to counter swarms of small boats, crewed and uncrewed, something that remains a real threat. Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen have been particular pioneers in the use of explosive-laden uncrewed kamikaze boats. However, Ukraine's employment of a still-expanding array of uncrewed surface vessels, including kamikaze types, in and around the Black Sea has been responsible for fully thrusting the dangers they pose into the mainstream consciousness. In 2022, the Navy also showed that the SSMM could be used to fire Longbow Hellfires at targets on land. Leveraging the SSMM now as a rapid pathway to giving LCSs added counter-drone capabilities makes good sense. Beyond offering an additional layer of self-defense against uncrewed aerial threats for the ships themselves, this could allow them to provide a short-range protective umbrella for other friendly vessels nearby. It's unclear what the AGM-114L's range is when launched from the surface rather than the air. The Longbow Hellfire's maximum reach in the air-launched mode is reportedly between five and five and a half miles (8,000 and 9,000 meters) The idea, broadly, of employing AGM-114s, especially the radar-guided Longbow variant, against aerial threats is also not new. Israeli AH-64 attack helicopters have used Hellfires to down drones and the U.S. Army is increasingly training to do the same with its Apaches. Other U.S. military helicopters might be able to employ Hellfires in the air-to-air role, as well. The Army has also explored employing AGM-114Ls as surface-to-air interceptors in the past. . @USArmy Soldiers engage an unmanned aerial system (UAS) from an AH-64 with upgraded Hellfire missile during Red Sands training exercise in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. @usarmycentral pic.twitter.com/HG9ChuWxt6&mdash; U.S. Central Command (@CENTCOM) September 30, 2024 At the same time, just adding the counter-drone functionality to the SSMM last year underscores how the Navy and the rest of the U.S. military are still very much playing catch-up in responding to uncrewed aerial threats. The dangers posed by drones, including lower-end kamikaze types, are not new, as TWZ regularly notes. The scale and scope of these capabilities and the underlying technologies are ever-growing and are steadily proliferating even among non-state actors like the Houthis, as well as the armed forces of nation states large and small. How many more SSMM-equipped Freedom class LCSs now are in line to get the new counter-drone upgrades is unclear, as is when or if that capability might filter down to Independence class types. The Navy currently has 10 Freedom class LCSs in service, with another one now in the process of being fitted out. There are 16 more Independence class LCSs on the service's rolls and another one of those ships on the way. The USS Freedom, at rear, sails alongside the USS Independence, in the foreground, as an example of both types together. These two particular ships have since been decommissioned. USN The USS Freedom, at rear, sails alongside the USS Independence, in the foreground. The lead ships in both of their classes of Littoral Combat Ships (LCS), these vessels were both been decommissioned in 2021. USN The addition of counter-drone capability to the SSMM might also open up new avenues to employing Hellfires, as well as that missile successor the AGM-179A Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM), on other Navy ships in that role, as well as against other target sets. Lockheed Martin notably had a model of an Arleigh Burke class destroyer equipped with two arrays of launchers that could be used to fire Hellfires or JAGMs on display at the Surface Navy Association's main annual symposium earlier this week. A close-up of the Hellfire/JAGM launchers on the Arleigh Burke model on display at the 2025 Surface Navy Association symposium. Joseph Trevithick TWZ has reached out to the Navy and Lockheed Martin for more information. Speaking at the Surface Navy Association symposium on Wednesday, Navy Capt. Mark Haney did say the Freedom class USS Minneapolis-Saint Paul is set to receive the same counter-drone modifications to its SSMM that are now found on the USS Indianapolis. Haney, who is Commodore of Littoral Combat Ship Squadron 2 based in Mayport, Florida, also said that Minneapolis-Saint Paul will be the most capable Freedom class LCS deployed to date when it heads out later this year. 'Full SUW [Surface Warfare] package, 30-millimeter guns, an SSMM capability that also adds the counter-UAS to it, a Romeo [MH-60R Seahawk] helicopter det[achment], as well as a new UAV [uncrewed aerial vehicle] that we've never deployed before on the LCS, and that is the Aerosonde,' Haney explained. The ship will also have 'two 11-meter RIBs [rigid inflatable boats], [a U.S.] Coast Guard det[achment], and a U.S. Navy VBSS [visit, board, search, and seizure] capability.' Freedom class LCSs also have a 57mm gun in a turret on the bow and a 21-round launcher for RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missiles (RAM) toward the stern. RAMs provide close-in defense primarily against incoming cruise missiles, but can also be employed against other aerial threats, including drones, as well as small boats. It's worth noting here that the AGM-114L in the anti-drone role also offers a valuable lower-cost alternative to the RIM-116. Official budget documents from the Army, which is the lead service for Hellfire, provide only an average unit cost across all variants, pegged at between approximately $150,000 and $215,000 in recent years. The current price tag on a single RAM is around $950,000. RAM is the cheapest of U.S. Navy counter-air missiles, with longer-range weapons being a multiple of that cost. More firepower for Freedom class LCSs is also expected in the future in the form of launchers for Naval Strike Missile (NSM) cruise missiles and greater availability of containerized Mk 70 launchers that can fire multi-purpose Standard Missile-6 (SM-6) and Tomahawk cruise missiles. It is worth noting that the Mk 70s go on the ship's stern helipad, which would severely limit, if not eliminate its ability to embark helicopters. Newer members of the Freedom class, including Minneapolis-Saint Paul, also have an active electronically scanned array (AESA) TRS-4D air and surface search and target acquisition radar. All Freedoms have an electronic support measure (ESM) package, as well. The USS Minneapolis-Saint Paul. The rectangular TRS-4D radar is seen on top of the ship's main mast. USN At the same time, Capt. Haney's comments this week highlighted longer-standing issues with the Freedom and Independence class LCSs having failed to live up to expectations and continued questions about their operational utility. For instance, originally the expectation was the LCSs would be readily reconfigurable with different modules and mission packages like the SSMM to increase their flexibility. The ships are now deployed in largely static configurations. In addition, the two classes of LCSs have also been beset by structural and technical issues over the years. Propulsion systems problems have plagued the Freedom class in particular and have contributed to the decommissioning of some of those ships well before the end of their expected service lives. The Navy has been pushing to get more operational use out of its LCSs, which currently represent a significant portion of its overall surface warship fleets, in recent years. This includes the first-ever deployment of a Freedom class type to the Middle in 2022 and plans to begin forward-deploying other ships in the class in Bahrain later this year. Independence class types regularly sail in the Pacific. As earlier noted, USS Indianapolis has now become the first LCS to receive a Combat Action Ribbon, which was awarded following a Houthi attack aimed at the ship, as well as Arleigh Burke class destroyers USS Stockdale and USS Spruance, last September. Another stock shot of the USS Indianapolis. USN The full citation accompanying the Combat Action Ribbon, which TWZ obtained from the Navy, reads: 'For outstanding service in support of military operations from 25 September 2024 to 27 September 2024. USS Indianapolis (LCS 17) effectively executed dynamic and kinetic responses to threats from Iranian-backed Houthi non-state actors emanating from the Red Sea in the Fifth Fleet Area of Responsibility (AOR).' 'From 25 September 2024 to 27 September 2024, USS Indianapolis (LCS 17), USS Stockdale (DDG 106), and USS Spruance (DDG 111) were operating off the coast of Yemen in the Red Sea conducting a northbound Bab-al-Mandeb transit when several salvos of enemy unmanned aerial vehicles and missiles were launched from Yemen, targeting the Surface Action Group (SAG). USS Indianapolis (LCS 17) provided early indications and warnings through the analysis of electronic signals, prioritizing potential threats, ensuring proper de-confliction orders across the force in the Electronic Warfare Spectrum, ensuring the SAG was prepared to respond to any hostile act in the Recognized Maritime Picture (RMP) and Recognized Air Picture (RAP). In response, the SAG engaged with Standard Missiles 2 (RIM-66), Standard Missiles 6 (RIM-176), and launched chaff eliminating the threats and enabling the SAG to continue its mission.' Still, there is notably no indication here that USS Indianapolis fired any of its own weapons in anger in this particular engagement, which also prominently highlights the lack of more robust air defense capabilities on the LCSs. Whether the ship employed any of its weapons against hostile targets in the course of the rest of its deployment is unknown. All of this also now comes amid major delays and other issues with the Navy's Constellation class frigate program. The service has been working to acquire the new frigates in no small part to provide a more capable small surface combatant than the long-underperforming LCSs. In the meantime, the Navy continues to try to squeeze more operational value of its LCS, including now through the addition of counter-drone capability to the SSMM.

F-15E Strike Eagle With New EPAWSS Electronic Warfare Suite Heads...	A first operational U.S. Air Force F-15E Strike Eagle equipped with a sophisticated new radar warning and electronic warfare suite that provides a major boost to its survivability has returned to its unit. As you can read about here, the AN/ALQ-250 Eagle Passive/Active Warning Survivability System, or EPAWSS, provides the F-15E with a full electronic warfare overhaul, but it has taken a long time to come online. There is also some uncertainty about the future size of the Strike Eagle fleet and how many jets might eventually get the upgrade. The same system is meanwhile also being installed on the Air Force’s new-production F-15EX Eagle II jets. The first operational F-15E equipped with EPAWSS was delivered to the 48th Fighter Wing at RAF Lakenheath in England on January 15, the Air Force announced. Meanwhile, Boeing published a video on social media of the jet preparing to depart San Antonio, Texas, where it received the upgrade from BAE Systems, which developed EPAWSS.

A U.S. Air Force F-15E arrives at RAF Lakenheath, England, on January 15, 2025, after being equipped with EPAWSS. U.S. Air Force Senior Airman Seleena Muhammad-Ali 'EPAWSS significantly improves the survivability and lethality of the F-15E Strike Eagle and F-15EX Eagle II, and the fact the first modifications are delivering to our frontline fighters at RAF Lakenheath is even more critical,' said Brig. Gen. Jason Voorheis, Program Executive Officer for the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center’s Fighters and Advanced Aircraft Directorate, which is leading the effort to field the new system. 'It has taken us a long time to get to this point, but this system is vital to our 21st-century fighter force structure. Not only does this system keep our most lethal fighter in the modern fight, [but] it’s an incredible deterrent in our Great Power Competition initiative.' In upgraded F-15Es, EPAWSS replaces the old AN/ALQ-135 Tactical Electronic Warfare System (TEWS). Compared to the standard F-15E configuration, aircraft upgraded with EPAWSS feature strengthened tailplane supporting beams, each of which has a pair of rounded antenna fairings at the end.

U.S. Air Force/1st Lt Savanah Bray An F-15E Strike Eagle with the EPAWSS electronic warfare suite that is also found on the F-15EX. EPAWSS could be one of the systems through which Cognitive Electronic Warfare capability might be introduced to the F-15E and the F-15EX. USAF Designed to sample the electromagnetic spectrum, identify threats, prioritize, and allocate jamming resources against them, EPAWSS is described by its manufacturer as follows: 'Providing both offensive and defensive electronic warfare options for the pilot and aircraft, EPAWSS offers fully integrated radar warning, geolocation, situational awareness, and self-protection solutions to detect and defeat surface and airborne threats in signal-dense contested and highly contested environments. Equipped with advanced electronic countermeasures, it enables deeper penetration against modern integrated air defense systems, providing rapid response capabilities to protect the aircrew.' In an operational context, EPAWSS ensures the Strike Eagle aircrew receives timely and accurate warnings of ground-based and airborne radio-frequency (RF) threats, including their specific type and location. With this enhanced situational awareness, the crew is much better able to avoid, engage, or negate the threat. As well as alerting the crew to the threats as a defensive system, EPAWSS is able to target these threats offensively, employing countermeasures and providing targeting for effectors. The system can also be used to detect and counter incoming infrared threats, but the F-15Es do not appear to have the missile approach warning systems (MAWS) detectors installed at this time, which would help significantly in this regard. EPAWSS might have taken a while to arrive, but there’s no doubt it was badly needed. Based on 1970s analog technology, the TEWS has long been considered obsolescent, at least when it comes to facing the kinds of threats that might be encountered in a conflict with a high-end adversary, such as China or Russia. Since the AN/ALQ-135 was introduced, there have been enormous advances in air defense capabilities, including the proliferation of high-end surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), with performance far beyond what was envisaged when the F-15E began to enter service in the late 1980s. An F-15E going into combat against a peer or neer-peer adversary today would very likely face ground-based air defense threats offering a very long range, active electronically scanned array (AESA) technology, counter-jamming capabilities, and a high degree of mobility. Even lower-tier adversaries are, in some instances, able to field systems in this class. A screen capture of the Russian S-500 long-range air defense system as seen in a 2021 Russian Defense Ministry video. Typical of the advancing air defense threat, the S-500 is claimed to have a range of at least 300 miles. Russian Defense Ministry A screen capture from the Russian Defense Ministry video of the 2021 test showing one of the 10&#215;10 TELs used in the S-500 system. Russian MoD There is no sign that the pace of developments in air defense threats will slow any time soon and, with this in mind, EPAWSS is designed to be rapidly and easily updated, aided by its open-architecture setup. In this way, new capabilities can be added very rapidly to address emerging threats. 'EPAWSS is a line update item, it’s one of those things that we just need to get the appropriate data and maintenance to load updated information,' Maj. Aaron 'Kamikazze' Eshkenazi, of the 85th Test and Evaluation Squadron at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, explained to TWZ in a previous interview. Indeed, since it’s software-defined, it might even be possible to configure it to adapt to new threats — even those never detected before — in near real-time in the future, something you can read more about here. Other advantages include reduced maintenance demands and a higher degree of reliability compared to legacy equipment. At the same time, EPAWSS is smaller and lighter than its predecessor, thanks to it being fully digital. This in turn allows for an increase in the number of chaff and flare countermeasures cartridges that can be carried. An F-15E suspended from the ceiling at the Benefield Anechoic Facility during its first phase of testing of the EPAWSS at Edwards Air Force Base, California, May 8, 2019. U.S. Air Force/Ethan 'Evac' Wagner EPAWSS 'takes advantages of today’s computing, receiver, and transmitter technologies to provide a quicker, smarter response to the threats and better actionable information to the pilot,' Ed Sabat, Project Development Lead and Civilian Director of Operations, 772nd Test Squadron, explained in an earlier Air Force press release about the system. In the future, EPAWSS could also become critical to the integration of Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones and launched effects, providing intelligence on where they should be deployed for the best tactical advantage at any given time. With their far superior view of the electromagnetic battlespace, EPAWSS-equipped F-15s will be well-suited to the airborne commander or ‘quarterback’ role, also being able to share the data they hoover up with other platforms. Further details of exactly how EPAWSS works, and the kinds of threats it can defeat remain a closely guarded secret. EPAWSS is one of several important upgrades for the F-15E in recent years, including the Raytheon AN/APG-82 AESA radar, which is also integrated into the electronic warfare system as it is a highly capable electronic attack weapon in its own right. It has also added certain niche capabilities, such as the AN/ASQ-236 Dragon’s Eye radar pod that you can read about in this previous feature. New weapons and weapons configurations have also appeared, adding to the Strike Eagle’s versatility. The AN/APG-82 AESA radar on a test stand. Raytheon Although EPAWSS is seen as fundamental to ensure the F-15E’s survivability in the kind of contested airspace environments in which the Air Force might expect to find itself fighting in the future, it’s not entirely clear what the future Strike Eagle fleet might look like. Last summer, we reported on the effort of members of Congress to block Air Force plans to send more than half of its F-15E fleet to the boneyard in the coming years. The Air Force argues that it needs to retire older F-15Es to help free up resources for its future modernization plans, but lawmakers have been concerned about dwindling numbers of available tactical aircraft were this to happen. Currently, the Air Force has 218 F-15Es in its inventory. Of those aircraft, 119 are powered by a pair of Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-220 turbofan engines that produce some 23,500 pounds of thrust each. The other 99 have two F100-PW-229s, which are significantly more powerful, with each engine rated at 29,000 pounds of thrust. The Air Force had hoped to retire all of the F-15Es with the -220 engines, which are also older overall, by the end of Fiscal Year 2028.

Devin Rumbaugh Most recently, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 blocked the Air Force from retiring more than 68 F-15Es before the end of Fiscal Year 2029. Previously, it was reported that 99 F-15Es (those with F100-PW-229 engines) would get EPAWSS, but the new legislation could potentially see the number increase. That the F-15E remains a highly prized asset, selected for a variety of high-profile operational missions was underlined in April 2024, when the aircraft shot down more than 70 Iranian drones heading for Israel. While EPAWSS is being retrofitted in existing F-15Es, the equipment is being installed in the new, more advanced F-15EX Eagle II aircraft as they are being built. However, F-15EX fleet numbers have been reduced, from the original plan for at least 144 aircraft, to what is now expected to be only 98 aircraft. EPAWSS capabilities in the F-15EX are further enhanced by the large-area display in the cockpit, providing improved visualization of the threat. An F-15EX undergoes testing at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. Jamie Hunter Jamie Hunter It remains to be seen exactly how many F-15Es receive EPAWSS, but those that are now returning to their units after being retrofitted with the new equipment will be prized examples among what were already some of the Air Force’s most in-demand tactical assets. With air defense threats becoming ever more diverse, complex, and unpredictable, EPAWSS will ensure these upgraded aircraft — and the new-build F-15EX — are effective for many years to come.

The Famed Ex-USS John F. Kennedy Casts Off On Its Final Voyage	On a cold, dreary Thursday in Philadelphia, a smattering of people came to the waterfront to see the former Kitty Hawk class aircraft carrier U.S.S. John F. Kennedy (CV-67) begin its final journey. Nicknamed 'Big John,' the Kitty Hawk class sub-variant began a trip from the U.S. Navy’s Inactive Ships Maintenance Facility to the International Shipbreaking Limited facility in Brownsville, Texas. There it will be cut up and its remnants sold for scrap. After 17 years in Philadelphia, Big John is expected to arrive at its final destination sometime next month, a Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) spokesman told The War Zone. It will transit south through the Atlantic Ocean, around the Florida peninsula, and then across the Gulf of Mexico. No date has yet been set for the ship’s dismantling.

For a brief time this even included talk of returning Kitty Hawk to service and rumors of selling Big John to India. There were several more grounded but unsuccessful attempts to keep them from the scrapper's torch. The Navy set the John F. Kennedy aside for possible conversion into a museum ship after it was decommissioned. Multiple groups attempted to secure the vessel for that purpose, but none of those efforts proved successful. Nuclear powered supercarriers cannot be museum ships, so these were the last opportunities for such a second life for the Navy's largest warships. Commissioned on Sept. 7, 1968, the flattop was the first Navy ship to be named John F. Kennedy and was the last U.S. conventionally powered aircraft carrier built. It was retired from service in 2007, 39 years later. The USS John F. Kennedy at the U.S. Navy’s Inactive Ships Maintenance Facility. (USN) www.twz.com The vessel was a one-of-a-kind derivative of the Kitty Hawk class design originally intended to be nuclear-powered. It entered service at the height of the Vietnam War, but did not see service there. However, it did support a variety of other missions, including the U.S. response to the bombing of Marine Corps Barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, in 1983 and the first Gulf War in 1991. The carrier and its air wing were called upon to provide combat air patrols after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and the ship also took part in the early stages of the war in Afghanistan.

That problem is only about to get far more amplified. Scrapping a nuclear powered vessel of similar size is far more complicated and plagued with hazards. By comparison, the net cost to dismantle the former USS Enterprise - the Navy’s first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier - could be as high as $1.55 billion, according to a 2018 Government Accountability Report. This won't be the last flattop to bear the 35th president's name. The future Ford class USS John F.

According to NAVSEA, once the ship hits open waters, it won’t be visible again from shore until it nears the Texas city of San Padre Island on the Gulf of Mexico.

This Is The Type Of Russian Decoy Drone Shot Down Over Kyiv As Br...	A Russian decoy drone was engaged by Ukrainian air defenses over Kyiv today, close to where President Volodymyr Zelensky was meeting British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, leader of one of Ukraine’s staunchest allies. The drone’s presence further underscores the threat posed to Ukraine by long-range Russian uncrewed aerial vehicles, including unarmed ones intended to stimulate and confuse Ukrainian air defenses. The incident also coincided with Starmer announcing that the United Kingdom would provide Kyiv with additional mobile air defense systems, of undisclosed type. The drone, apparently a Russian Parodiya decoy type, was seen above the Mariinskyi Palace, the presidential residence on the right bank of the Dnipro River. Multiple accounts state that local air defenses tried to bring the drone down and detonations could be heard. At least one account suggests a drone was brought down, adding that, according to eyewitnesses, there were at least two drones over the capital.

The Parodiya is among a number of different types of Russian decoy drones that have begun to appear in increasing numbers in the conflict in recent months. These also include the Gerbera drone, which you can read about here, which seems to be used primarily in support of attacks by Geran/Shahed-series long-range one-way attack drones.

It is powered by a piston engine driving a propeller in the nose. Like the Gerbera, the Parodiya is reportedly primarily intended to mimic the Geran/Shahed attack drones, using a radar-reflective Luneburg lens for this purpose. Wreckage of Parodiya drones reveals the internal Luneburg lenses. GUR In this way, the decoy will appear to Ukrainian air defenses as if it’s an attack drone, prompting them to try and engage it and increasing the likelihood that attack drones will make it to their target. Even if no attack drones are present, these decoys can suck up hugely valuable interceptors which are prized and not easily replenished. A drone like this that cost maybe $10k can be brought down by a missile that costs $1M at least, leaving less of them for real threats. A Parodiya decoy drone that came down somewhere in Ukraine. GUR According to the Ukrainian Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR), the Parodiya also contains a significant number of components produced by Western companies, which has been a recurring motif in Russian high-end weapons. Other components in the drone were sourced from China, the GUR claims. Electroncis inside a Parodiya decoy drone. Ukrainian Police In November last year, Ukrainian Air Force spokesperson Yurii Ihnat told CNN that the Parodiya and other types of decoy drones accounted for up to half of all drones used by Russia in its large-scale attacks on Ukraine. The sound of anti-aircraft fire over Kyiv today was highly symbolic, as Zelensky and Starmer met ahead of a press conference at the presidential palace. This was the U.K. prime minister’s first official trip to Ukraine since taking office. Starmer said the drone was a reminder of what Ukrainians experienced every day. 'It makes it real for us,' he said. 'It’s an everyday threat Ukraine is facing with incredible resolve and determination.'

Photo by Carl Court/PA Images via Getty Images Carl Court - PA Images While it’s unclear whether the Parodiya was accompanied by attack drones, today’s incident over Kyiv is not the first possible close call during a visit to Ukraine by a Western leader. In March last year, we reported on how President Zelensky and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis were in the vicinity of a Russian missile strike on the Ukrainian port city of Odesa. The Greek prime minister later described the incident as 'intense.' The timing, location, and weapon used in the strike led some to suggest that it was a decapitation attempt by Russia. Unconfirmed reports suggest that Odesa came under attack from Russian Iskander-M short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs), one of which may have landed as close as 220 yards from the two leaders. President Zelensky and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis in the Ukrainian port city of Odesa in March 2024. Photo by Presidency of Ukraine/Anadolu via Getty Images Russia may have even timed the use of these non-lethal drones to coincide with the Prime Minster's visit. Returning to today’s events, the drone incident came as Starmer announced a 'closer than ever' partnership with Ukraine, a statement of commitment that comes just days before Donald Trump returns to the White House, bringing uncertainty about the nature of future U.S. military support to Ukraine. Today, the Ukrainian and British leaders announced a new defense partnership including additional military assistance for Ukraine. 'The power of our long-term friendships [must not be] underestimated. Supporting Ukraine to defend itself from Russia’s barbaric invasion and rebuild a prosperous, sovereign future is vital to this government’s foundation of security and our plan for change,' Starmer said. There have been reports that the two leaders may have also discussed the possibility of British troops being deployed in Ukraine as part of a postwar peacekeeping force. Accounts in the British media today suggested that this might be one of several options being discussed that would involve British and French soldiers being sent to Ukraine following a potential peace deal. The United Kingdom has been at the forefront of delivering military aid to Ukraine, especially when it comes to weapons that were previously considered ‘off the table’ due to their assumed potential for escalating tensions between Russia and the West. The United Kingdom was quick to send shoulder-launched anti-aircraft and anti-tank weapons to Ukraine and was the first to announce it would begin training Ukrainian pilots to operate modern NATO-standard fighter jets. When, in 2023, the United Kingdom said it would send 14 of its Challenger 2 main battle tanks to Ukraine, it kickstarted a broader international effort to get similar equipment to Ukraine, with the British tanks being followed by German-made Leopard 2s and U.S.-made M1 Abrams.

Photo by Genya SAVILOV / AFP GENYA SAVILOV Perhaps most prominently, the United Kingdom has supplied Ukraine with Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missiles, which have been used in multiple high-profile attacks on Russian targets both in occupied Ukraine and, more recently, within Russia’s own borders, in the Kursk region.

Via X Twitter screencap The next tranche of British military support for Kyiv will include undisclosed mobile air defense systems, additional training for Ukrainian soldiers, as well as 150 artillery barrels. This is part of a wider pledge to provide £3 billion (around $3.67 billion) of British support a year, to be continued indefinitely. Whatever comes next for Ukraine, British military support looks to be a given for the time being. With new air defense systems now headed from the United Kingdom to Ukraine, the drone incident over Kyiv today was a very timely reminder of the continued threat from Russian attacks of this kind, and the continued need for air defense equipment, a demand that is only further driven by the growing presence of decoy drones like the Parodiya.

Investigation Launched Into Transfer Of Ukrainian MiG-29 Maintain...	The Ukrainian Air Force has created a commission to investigate whether key personnel are being transferred to the front lines amid a shortage of troops defending the east. The move comes after a major controversy erupted after one unit claimed that its MiG-29 Fulcrum maintainers were sent to the infantry, drastically affecting its ability to launch sorties. It was the latest of several such allegations, which Ukrainian officials have denied. 'The commission is working to prevent the transfer of deficient specialties of military personnel, which could significantly impact the combat ability of Air Force units,' spokesman Col. Yuri Ignat stated on Facebook Thursday. At issue are troops maintaining aircraft and operating and maintaining anti-aircraft systems, radio-technical troops, mobile fire groups, and military personnel who have been trained abroad on Western weapons. Losing them to the infantry could have a cascading effect on the ability to launch strikes with its limited aviation assets or defend against them from the air and ground. Ukrainian Air Force maintainers perform routine upkeep of the aircraft after a flight on August 1, 2023 in eastern Ukraine. (Photo by Libkos/Getty Images) LIBKOS 'Appropriate decisions have been made to prevent the transfer of military personnel of deficient specialties to other types and types of the Armed Forces,' Ignat explained. 'Currently, the Air Force Commission is checking whether there [are any violations]. If such cases are identified, decisions will be made to rectify them.' Ignat's announcement included several phone numbers for people to call with tips. 'It's not the first year that the Air Force soldiers are strengthening brigades of other kinds and types of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the hottest fronts of the front, side by side with the brothers take part in fierce battles, within their capabilities to destroy the enemy with all available weapons, both in the stationary units of the Air Force, and in other units,' the Air Force spokesman added. Ignat’s statement follows a call by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday for the Air Force to ensure that no key personnel are being sent to fight as infantry, regardless of mounting losses in personnel and territory. 'Today, there was a lot of information, outrage and discussion – regarding the transfers,' Zelensky said in his nightly address. 'I have instructed to clarify everything for the public and to ensure that the number of specialists needed by the Air Force to carry out combat missions – for our aviation, air defense, and mobile fire groups – is not reduced.' The Ukrainian president was reacting to claims made earlier that day by a sergeant from the Carpathian 114th Air Force Brigade that hundreds of Fulcrum maintainers were given orders to head to the front lines, according to the Ukrainian Galka news outlet. The unit received a telegram about the transfer of almost all its technicians to the infantry, meaning there would be few left to service the aircraft, Sgt. Vitaliy ‘Bart’ Gorzhevskyi claimed in a video message. Previously, 250 people were taken from the brigade, with another 218 slated for transfer, he noted. The War Zone cannot independently verify these claims. 'We, aviation technical personnel, have been fulfilling our mission for over 10 years, servicing MiG-29 fighters,' Gorzhevskyi stated. 'Since 2014, we have been working in the most difficult conditions, providing combat sorties and maintaining our aviation in service. We have mastered new types of aircraft provided by Western partners, and are training a new generation of pilots. Without technical personnel, aviation will not be able to function. We worked alongside legendary pilots such as Juice, Karaya, Smereka, and each of us firmly believes in our mission and loyalty to the Motherland.' One of those pilots, Vadym 'Karaya' Voroshylov, echoed Gorzhevskyi’s concerns. 'Personally, I and every pilot of the Air Force owe them for the constant combat readiness and serviceability of aircraft,' he said in an Instagram post. 'Are we ready to simply give them up? No, because these are very narrowly focused specialists who studied at higher military educational institutions for 5 years, and gained professional experience in training aircraft in combat brigades and in combat conditions.' 'I witnessed many cases when the airfield was under enemy fire, and the engineering staff moved aviation equipment to shelter after takeoff, or extracted pilots from the cockpit of burning aircraft,' he added. 'Unfortunately, some of them gave their lives saving aviation equipment that was on the ground in such cases.' The bottom line, said Voroshylov, is that transferring ground crews 'will lead to problems with the maintenance and servicing of aircraft - as a result, we will have a decrease in the combat capability of aviation brigades. Aviation is one large ecosystem, the life of which directly depends on the performance of the functional duties of each element, which is IMPOSSIBLE to replace. I want to defend my people, our aviation!' You can see a 2023 interview he gave in the following video. A Ukrainian hero, fighter pilot 'Karaya,' talked to us about what it’s like flying combat missions (in inferior jets to the Russians) and shared with @scrippsnews video he recorded in his cockpit. It’s wild how close to the ground they need to fly to avoid enemy radar. #ukraine pic.twitter.com/bB9dLzXwJs&mdash; jasonbellini (@jasonbellini) April 20, 2023 Ukrainian media outlets have reported previous transfers of key personnel from the Air Force to the infantry. Thousands of Air Force troops have been transferred this way, according to the Kyiv Independent. 'Reports indicated that since 2024, thousands of Air Force soldiers have been transferred to the Ground Forces,' the publication wrote. 'The latest directive was issued on Jan. 11, when Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi issued an order to transfer over 5,000 Air Force personnel to Ground Forces units.' A senior Air Force officer, 'speaking anonymously, said transfers have now reached a ‘critical level,’ with unit staffing dropping to 50%,' the publication added. 'Since 2024, combat brigades of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine have been replenished with soldiers transferred from Ukraine’s Air Force units. This has continued into 2025. The latest order from Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi on the transfer of personnel… pic.twitter.com/4mrJMsuaCO&mdash; Rob Lee (@RALee85) January 14, 2025 The Ukrainian Militinaryi news outlet said it 'knows that the large-scale withdrawal of personnel from the Air Force was authorized' by Syrsky. In addition to aviation units, the transfers 'also affected the anti-aircraft and radio engineering units of the [Ukrainian Air Force],' the publication added.' In particular, we are talking about the maintenance of anti-aircraft missile systems, including SAM operators trained abroad, as well as radar system operators.' 'This is already the third large-scale transfer of personnel,' Militinaryi noted. 'According to officers, when this order is implemented, the staffing in some parts of the anti-aircraft missile forces will fall below 40%. According to regulatory documents, this is the level of a non-combat unit.' The Ukrainian Air Force 'already has its own infantry brigade, formed from personnel of the aviation, anti-aircraft missile troops and radio engineering troops, which has been fighting in various directions for more than a year,' Militinaryi explained. 'It is known that the fighters of the infantry brigade of the [Air Force], together with units of the marines, participated in the most difficult battles on the left bank of the Kherson region in Krynki, in Zaporizhia during the offensive operation and are currently defending the country in the Vovchansk area.' You can see how the fighting has damaged Vovchansk in the video below. russian airstrikes have heavily damaged Vovchansk.

'The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine officially reports that it was not and is not planned to transfer the urgently needed specialists of the Air Force engineering and aviation service who service aircraft to infantry units,' it stated in a Telegram post. 'Instead, the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is increasing the number of technical and flight personnel.' The General Staff, however, did acknowledge that 'certain categories of personnel of the Air Force, as well as other branches and branches of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, after preliminary training in training centers, strengthen the Ground Forces, Airborne Assault Forces, etc.' It is unclear why the Ukrainian Air Force is still investigating these transfers after the General Staff's denial that they happened. We've reached out to Ignat for more details. The controversy over these transfers highlights the precarious position Ukraine finds itself in, trying to defend the east, where Russian forces continue to slowly gain more ground, while at the same time sustaining its invasion into Russia’s Kursk region. 'The situation at the front is not easy, in many areas there is a shortage of infantrymen,' the General Staff explained. 'The decision to strengthen the ground brigades on the front line at the expense of servicemen from units of other branches and branches of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is a forced step by the military leadership to strengthen our defense.'

Navy Warships Have To Leave The Red Sea Fight For Weeks To Reload...	U.S. Navy destroyers and cruisers needing to leave the ongoing battle against Iran-backed Houthi rebel missile and drone barrages in the Red Sea to reload their Mk 41 Vertical Launching System (VLS) missile cells are causing a presence gap and 'a real challenge,' Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro said Wednesday at the annual Surface Navy Association conference. That challenge extends not only to the Red Sea campaign, he said, but especially to a future war with China across the vast West Pacific expanse as well. As such, continuing development of the Transferrable Reload At-sea Method (TRAM) to reload missiles on warships while at sea will be critical to keeping large surface combatants on station in such a contingency, Del Toro said at the conference, which TWZ attended. Navy leaders have framed the ongoing Red Sea battles as the most sustained kinetic action the service has seen since World War II, with hundreds of munitions having been expended since hostilities commenced in October 2023, draining some ships’ of a sizable portion of their missile and gun ammunition arsenals. You can read our complete breakdown of how many of each missile here. 'We simply cannot afford to give up two weeks for destroyers and cruisers and future frigates to be able to reload,' Del Toro said. 'This critical capability will significantly increase our ability to maintain forward presence without the need to withdraw from combat for extended periods of in-port reloading time.' The TRAM has been in development for years and was successfully demonstrated in October, when the Military Sealift Command dry cargo ship USNS Washington Chambers (T-AKE 11) pulled alongside the Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Chosin (CG-65) and transferred an empty VLS weapon container to the cruiser while underway off southern California. Go here to read TWZ coverage of that milestone. Sailors change out an empty Vertical Launching System (VLS) weapon container aboard the Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Chosin (CG-65) in October. (U.S. Navy) A missile canister travels across cables from the dry cargo and ammunition ship USNS Washington Chambers (T-AKE 11), foreground, to the cruiser USS Chosin (CG-65) during a test of the Transferrable Reload At-sea Method (TRAM) in October. (U.S. Navy) Eric Osborne Sailors used TRAM to move a missile canister along rails that were attached to Chosin’s VLS modules, the Navy said when announcing the successful test. The canister was then tilted into a vertical position and lowered into a VLS cell via the TRAM’s cable and pulley system. Civilian mariners aboard the dry cargo and ammunition ship USNS Washington Chambers (T-AKE 11) prepare to send an empty missile canister across cables to the cruiser USS Chosin (CG-65) as part of an at-sea test of the Transferrable Reload At-sea Method, or TRAM, in October. (U.S. Navy) The hydraulically powered TRAM can be used while a ship is undergoing underway replenishment, which is a regular yet demanding evolution where various supplies are ferried from a supply ship to a warship as the two vessels move in parallel. Last fall’s test was highly anticipated, with Capitol Hill lawmakers taking a major interest in the capability. Before that, a pier-side trial at the Naval Surface Warfare Centers Port Hueneme division outside San Diego in July was also a success. Del Toro said after the test that TRAM was on track to be fielded in two to three years. But his comments this week reinforce the fact that a maritime war against China featuring an American armada dispersed across the West Pacific will require an at-sea reloading capability. In such a conflict, Navy bases in Japan would likely be cut off by China, forcing U.S. ships to rearm at Guam or locations even further from the South China Sea and East China Sea, where such a war would be expected to rage if Beijing invades Taiwan or tensions in the South China Sea turn red hot. Ashore reloading hubs would likely become prime targets for the enemy as well. There’s also the fact that a Navy destroyer or cruiser could be left at least partially undefended when transiting a naval war zone with empty missile cells. At-sea reloading would cut down on the transit time for re-upping a warship’s munitions, while allowing such ships to stay at least closer to the action, even though rearming would likely take place at least some distance from the core of the fighting. 'The opponent would have weakened our fleet even without scoring a punch' if warships have to leave the battle to reload, James Holmes, a maritime strategy professor at the Naval War College, told Navy Times in 2017, after then-Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson announced the effort that would become TRAM. 'If we keep having to rotate cruisers or destroyers back to rear areas to reload, the opponent has subtracted that much combat power from the fleet.' Sailors aboard Navy cruiser USS Chosin (CG-65) use the Transferrable Reload At-sea Method, or TRAM move an empty missile canister over the ship's forward MK 41 Vertical Launching System (VLS) during the first at-sea demonstration of TRAM in October. (U.S. Navy) Such capabilities were part of the fleet before the end of the Cold War, but fell by the wayside after the Soviet Union’s fall amidst a broader U.S. military drawdown. Cranes were installed on the earlier cruisers back in the 1980s to assist with reloading, but it was a time-consuming and perilous tasker, analysts told Navy Times. 'It’s stressful for the equipment, it’s stressful for the people and it’s a challenge that’s been looked at for many years,' Eric Wertheim, a naval analyst and author of 'Combat Fleets of the World,' told Navy Times. 'It was very hard to do, and it was not very practicable, so when the need for it diminished, it just fell by the wayside.' It remains unclear where American warships fighting in the Red Sea are currently heading to reload their munitions, and U.S. Naval Forces Central Command officials declined to confirm those locations to TWZ Thursday. One likely reloading option is Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, which hosts rearming capabilities and sits aboard the strategically located Greek island of Crete in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. Such a voyage entails about 1,900 miles and would require a Navy warship to transit north out of the Red Sea via the Suez Canal. The Navy destroyer USS Mason (DDG-87) prepares to load missiles during a stop at Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Greece, in 2016. (U.S. Navy) Rearming at the Navy’s base in Bahrain is a roughly 2,500-mile voyage, and would involve leaving the Red Sea south through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and transiting the strategic chokepoint of the Strait of Hormuz. Diego Garcia is about the same distance, deep in the Indian Ocean. Some ships may be getting some munitions closer to the Red Sea, in partner nations, but it would be in a far more limited capacity. Allies in the Red Sea mission have also had to travel far to reload before returning to the area of operations. TWZ reported in February on the British destroyer HMS Diamond steaming all the way to Gibraltar to get more missiles after operating in the Red Sea. The Houthis have been attacking ships with missiles and drones, sometimes at a near-daily clip, since October 2023. But they signaled this week that they would halt their attacks if a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas takes effect. Even if the Navy's frenzied mission in the Red Sea soon ends, it has proven the need for an at-sea reloading capability. The sea service has gotten a taste during the Red Sea conflict of why the capability is so badly needed, even as it races to prepare for a future war in a very different theater that nonetheless presents some of the same challenges.

First Look At Stealth Destroyer’s Hypersonic Missile Launchers	Newly released pictures offer the first real look at the four new large launch tubes for firing Intermediate-Range Conventional Prompt Strike (IRCPS) hypersonic missiles now installed on the U.S. Navy's stealth destroyer USS Zumwalt. The other two ships in the Zumwalt class are also set to get the same array of tubes on their bows, which could also potentially be used to launch payloads beyond IRCPS. The ships are losing at least one of their 155mm Advanced Gun Systems (AGS), the advanced ammunition for which the Navy previously determined would be too expensive to buy, as part of the process. Navy Capt. Clint Lawler shared pictures showing the installation of USS Zumwalt's new launch tubes in a briefing yesterday at the Surface Navy Association’s main annual symposium. Lawler is the program manager for the three-ship Zumwalt class, also known as the DDG-1000 class, within the Navy's Program Executive Office for Ships (PEO Ships). USS Zumwalt has been at the HII shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi, since August 2023 for the IRCPS integration and just returned to the water after months in dry dock in December. The slide from Capt. Clint Lawler's presentation at the 2025 Surface Navy Association symposium, which also details the timeline for installing the new launch tubes onto the USS Zumwalt. USN In addition to providing the first real look at the launch tubes installed, Lawler's pictures give a sense of the scale of the work that was involved. As noted, the Zumwalt's forward 155mm AGS turret, as well as associated components then extend deep below decks, had to be removed first, a process that was completed in March 2024. A picture the Navy previously released showing one of USS Zumwalt's two AGS turrets being removed as part of the IRCPS integration process. USN The foundation for the new launch tubes went into the newly freed-up space in May 2024. The installation of additional bulkheads and other work followed quickly thereafter. The four launch tubes themselves were delivered to the yard between July and August of last year. The basic installation of the tubes was finished by October. USS Zumwalt seen in December 2024. HII Each one of the new launch tubes for the Zumwalt class ships is 87 inches, or 7.25 feet, in diameter, per a report from USNI News. IRCPS missiles will be triple-packed into the tubes via an Advanced Payload Module (APM) canister, for a total load of up to 12 missiles. The Navy also plans to eventually integrate IRCPS onto its future Block V Virginia class submarines. The IRCPS missiles themselves are tipped with an unpowered boost-glide vehicle on top and you can read more about hypersonic weapons of this general type here. The Navy is jointly developing the missile with the U.S. Army, which plans to field it in a ground-launched configuration called the Dark Eagle or Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW). A slide from a 2021 Navy briefing providing a visual overview of IRCPS and associated systems, including the APM canister, as well as the elements of the Army's Dark Eagle/LRHW effort. USN The goal now is to have Zumwalt ready for actual live-fire testing by the end of the year. Multiple ground-based IRCPS/Dark Eagle test launches have already occurred. This includes the first successful firing of one of the missiles from the Army's trailer-based launcher in December, which followed some two years of failed attempts to do so. The Army had blamed those setbacks on problems with the launcher, not the missile. There is the possibility that the new tubes being added to the Zumwalt class ships could be used to fire other payloads in addition to IRCPS missiles. A rendering on display at the Surface Navy Association symposium this week depicted a Zumwalt class ship with seven-round canisters loaded into at least two of the tubes, as seen in the social media post below. TWZ has reached out to the Navy for more information. Surface Navy Association’s 37th National Symposium #SNA2025 pic.twitter.com/aINV8CDq2c&mdash; 笑脸男人 (@lfx160219) January 16, 2025 The Navy's Ohio class guided missile submarines and Block 4 Virginia class boats both fire Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles from their large launch tubes via seven-round canisters. The Block 5 Virginias will also notably feature four more such tubes in a new Virginia Payload Module (VPM). Other canister designs, including ones that could be used to launch uncrewed underwater and aerial systems, have at least been tested in relation to the Ohio class in the past, as you can read more about here. It's also unclear what will happen to the second Advanced Gun System on each of the Zumwalt class ships. The other AGS mount on USS Zumwalt remains in place, at least for now, according to USNI News. That space could potentially be reutilized for other purposes. The Navy might also seek to finally find more affordable ammunition for those guns, which are currently unusable after the Navy balked at the $800,000 unit price of the precision-guided Long-Range Land Attack Projectiles (LRLAP) they were supposed to fire. Other advanced extended-range guided 155mm rounds have emerged since then, including ramjet-powered types the U.S. Army is currently exploring. In December, the Navy also awarded General Atomics a contract to help mature its Long Range Maneuvering Projectile (LRMP), an unpowered design that features pop-out wings. Regardless, as it stands now, the future USS Lyndon B. Johnson, the third Zumwalt class ship, which is still in the final phases of construction, is next in line to get the new launch tubes. When it comes to the AGS question, it's unclear whether Johnson has gotten or will get even a single turret. The second ship in the class, USS Michael Monsoor, will be the last to go through the conversion process. 'We’ve extended the combat system aggravation period [for Johnson] by two years to accomplish this installation,' Capt. Lawler said during his presentation yesterday, according to USNI News. 'The CPS work was placed on contract in August and we dry-docked the ship this past Sunday.' The future Zumwalt class destroyer USS Lyndon B. Johnson seen in 2018. USN The USS Zumwalt is expected to be able to actually employ IRCPS operationally sometime in 2026. Overall, the hypersonic missiles are viewed as an important new very-long-range strike capability for use against high-value strategic-level targets, especially in a future high-end fight, such as one against China in the Pacific. IRCPS also gives the extremely truncated Zumwalt class, which has seen its cutting-edge capabilities watered-down over the years, an important new purpose. Significant questions have been raised in the past about the exact roles and missions of the very costly trio of ships. The USS Michael Monsoor, the second Zumwalt class destroyer. USN With plans now to at least be able to fire an IRCPS missile from USS Zumwalt before the end of the year, 2025 looks set to be a particularly important period for the stealth destroyers.

Navy MH-60 Seahawk Helicopter Has Shot Down Its First Drone	A Navy MH-60R 'Romeo' Seahawk helicopter deployed to the Red Sea has shot down a Houthi drone, the Vice Chief of Naval Operations revealed Tuesday. While other rotorcraft have taken out drones – notably, a French AS565 Panther from the frigate Alsace in the Red Sea downed a Houthi unmanned aerial vehicle last March with its 7.62mm machine gun in an operation that was captured on video – this was a first for a U.S. Navy helicopter, Adm. James Kilby told an audience at the Surface Navy Association's annual symposium near Washington, D.C. Kilby was describing the body of information the Navy had accumulated from 15 months of continuous combat operations in the Red Sea, with 26 ships having been in the 'engagement zone' of fire from Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen during that period, and how pre-deployment training for these ships and elements continued to stress innovative and diverse ways to mitigate threats. At a virtual training he'd observed some months ago, 'F/A-18s were trying to knock down cruise missiles,' Kilby said. 'In fact, I was sitting in my office not too long ago where we had the first helicopter shoot down a UAV.'

(U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Mark Andrew Hays/Released) Petty Officer 2nd Class Mark Hays In a follow-up conversation with Vice Adm. Daniel Cheever, commander of Naval Air Forces, who also participated in the Red Sea panel, he confirmed that the shootdown had taken place 'about a month ago' and involved a Seahawk attached to the Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group. While Cheever did not specify the type of UAV that had been shot down or the means the helicopter had employed to take it out, he said the Seahawk crew had 'used a little bit of an unconventional system' to make the kill. 'It's an interesting world, you know, when you're talking ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and unmanned systems,' Cheever said. 'The one thing is, we're operating in the contested environment 24/7 and have been for [15] months. So when people talk about, you can't live in a contested environment, I kind of go, actually, we can and have and will.'

(U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class James R. Evans/Released) MC1 James R. Evans The MH-60R, the successor to the SH-60B, first flew for the Navy in 2001. It is specialized for anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare, but it has the ability to do other missions, as well. Beyond its core mission weaponry, it can be armed with a crew-served door gun — either the .50-caliber machine guns like the GAU-21/A or an M240 7.62mm machine gun. It can also carry up to eight AGM-114 Hellfire air-to-ground anti-tank missiles, which are primarily used for force protection against small boats. Hellfires have also been successfully employed against UAVs in the past; a video published by the Israeli Defense Forces in 2018 shows an Israeli AH-64 Apache helicopter swatting down an Iranian drone that had ventured into its sovereign airspace from Syria. Since then, Apaches have been playing an increasingly key role in drone defense for Israel.

These types of Hellfires are not available for the Seahawk, but laser-guided ones are. It’s possible one of these missiles was used in an ‘off-label’ manner to take down the drone.

(U.S. Navy Combat Camera photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Arthurgwain L. Marquez/Released) Petty Officer 2nd Class Arthurgwain Marquez Another possible UAV-killing tool for the Seahawk is the Advanced Precision Kill Weapons System II, consisting of Hydra 2.75-inch rockets equipped with a laser guidance kit. APKWS has been at least tested for use on the MH-60R since 2015 and is also employed on the Apache. In late 2022, defense contractor BAE Systems announced that five 70mm APKWS II rockets, equipped with guidance kits and modified proven proximity/point-detonation fuzes, had successfully taken out fast-moving drones in a ground-to-air test conducted in Arizona. With these modifications, the company said, APKWS II rockets could be successfully employed against UAVs weighing up to 50 pounds and traveling up to 100 miles per hour. Ukraine is operating multiple ground-based counter-drone systems that use the proximity-fuzed APKWS rockets. The USAF has also tested APKWS II with its fighters for anti-cruise missile defense. It’s also possible, like the Hellfire, that the MH-60 could have used a standard APKWS IIs to shoot down the drone, as well, if indeed the laser-guided rockets are actively available to fleet MH-60Rs. While Cheever's mention of an unconventional kill method raises questions about novel weapons or combinations of effects that might have been employed, the most likely option to take out the Houthi drone is perhaps the door gun – the same weapon employed by the French Panther during its successful kill in March. Helicopter door gunners have also been shooting down drones in the course of the ongoing fighting in Ukraine. Back in 2015, the Navy published a video of a Seahawk door gunner successfully taking out a target drone over the ocean during training. While UAV technology has evolved significantly, many of the unmanned systems used to target U.S. assets in the Red Sea remain relatively inexpensive as well as low and slow-moving – vulnerable to visual targeting and door gunner's bullets. While the Navy Seahawk's quietly executed drone shootdown may represent a first-of-its-kind kill against a UAV for the seagoing force, the Seahawk — including the MH-60R's cousin, the MH-60S — has already proved its mettle against other unmanned systems in the Red Sea. In late 2023, CENTCOM announced that Navy helicopters had sunk three small Houthi boats that attacked a U.S. position in the southern Red Sea, sending a fourth vessel fleeing back to shore. All these firsts and lessons learned, as well as mounds of raw sensor data, on a daily basis around the Red Sea are being leveraged far faster than ever before to come up with new tactics and systems modifications, and to train crews prior to deployment. The Seahawk's first drone 'kill' will certainly be used in this same manner. You can read all about this accelerated feedback cycle here. MH-60R gun at the ready. (Sikorsky) Navy leaders Tuesday also hinted that the service's deployed assets in the Red Sea are about to become even more deadly against drones. Rear Adm. William Daly, the service's director of surface warfare, said during recent deployments to the region, Navy destroyers had tested 'several' new counter-UAS systems, 'each bringing unique tactical capabilities.' 'I expect several of these systems to be deployed soon,' he said. In the meantime, Navy supercarriers, amphibious assault ships, and surface combatants that pack MH-60s now have another proven tool against aerial drones in their quivers.

Iran Unveils New Spy Ship Based On Corvette Hull	Iran has developed a reputation for launching some unconventional naval vessels, some of them downright strange — at least when compared with their equivalents elsewhere in the world. Its latest offering, the Zagros, is very much in keeping with this trend: a surveillance ship based on a corvette hull, an unorthodox approach for a type of vessel that would typically be converted from a commercial hull. A bow view of the Zagros, the latest Iranian intelligence-gathering vessel. Iranian state media The Zagros underway during helicopter operations. The flight deck is an unusual feature for a vessel of this kind. Iranian state media Iran unveiled its first domestically built signals intelligence (SIGINT) ship, the Zagros, yesterday. According to the state-run news agency IRNA, the ship has now officially joined the country’s naval fleet. 'The Zagros signals intelligence ship will be a vigilant eye for the Iranian Navy deep into seas and oceans,' the commander of the Iranian Navy, Adm. Shahram Irani, said in a statement. Iranian state media released footage of the vessel under construction, underway at sea, as well as Iranian Armed Forces Joint Chief of Staff Gen. Mohammad Bagheri and other military personnel visiting the ship and meeting with its crew.

Antennas for these sensors are housed in prominent ball-shaped radomes arranged around the top of the superstructure, with seven in all, of three different sizes, with the smaller ones likely to house satellite communications systems. An aerial view of the Zagros reveals the main sensors.

(@mhmiranusa) January 15, 2025 Iran’s semi-official Tasnim news agency has said the Zagros is also able to conduct cyber operations but provided no further details. Iranian state media In other respects, however, the Zagros exhibits some significant differences from more usual surveillance vessels. The state-run Fars news agency describes the new vessel as an 'intelligence destroyer,' reflecting the fact that the Zagros was built using a converted hull from a Mowj class warship, five of which are currently in service. These domestically produced vessels are classified as destroyers by Iran, but in terms of size and armament are much closer to light frigates, or corvettes, although the distinction between warship types — especially of these kinds — is increasingly blurred. Iran Unveils First Domestically Built Intelligence Destroyer pic.twitter.com/sJYPg1H02U&mdash; Fars News Agency (@EnglishFars) January 15, 2025 The Mowj class has a displacement of around 1,500 tonnes, a length of 311.7 feet, and a beam of 36.4 feet. The warship has a speed of around 30 knots and is operated by a typical crew of 140. A Mowj class corvette, the Deylaman, commissioned in November 2023. Iranian state media Specifications are currently not available for the Zagros, but the dimensions are presumably very similar. Based on the imagery published so far, the Zagros has no armament fitted, in contrast to the original Mowj class vessel, which is armed with a 76mm main gun, a 30mm close-in weapon system, Mehrab surface-to-air missiles, Noor or Qader anti-ship missiles, and torpedo tubes. However, unlike the original Mowj class, the Zagros has a flight deck and a hangar, able to accommodate a helicopter. Available imagery shows the ship embarking an Agusta-Bell AB212, a version of the Bell 212 built under license in Italy and equivalent to the U.S. military UH-1N. An AB212 helicopter operating from the flight deck. YouTube screencap/Iranian state media An embarked helicopter is an unusual feature of a SIGINT ship, suggesting that the vessel is intended to undertake other missions, as well, or perhaps the rotorcraft is intended simply to provide a means of logistical support when at sea for extended periods. On the other hand, a helicopter could also be used to provide a degree of force protection, especially important in the absence of other weapons aboard the ship — although some lighter weapons may still be fitted at a later date. Another option would be to outfit the helicopter with a sensor payload, increasing the overall area in which intelligence can be collected and providing a rapid means of gathering it from points of interest. So far, Iran has relied on adapted smaller commercial vessels to gather SIGINT and it’s not entirely clear why it took the opposite approach with the Zagros. Other countries typically take a commercial hull as the basis for a spy ship, since this offers considerable space for sensors and sensor operators as well as significant power-generation capabilities. Since their main role is peacetime surveillance, the combat capabilities of such vessels are very much secondary. Using a commercial hull also results in a ship that is far more efficient to build and operate, and which is more easily supportable once in service. This view of the Zagros, accompanied by two tug boats and a motor launch, shows the narrow corvette hull that offers relatively little internal volume for a ship of this kind. YouTube screencap/Iranian state media However, given that Iran has previously converted commercial hulls into warships — notably its fleet of 'forward base ships' — such an approach is perhaps not entirely surprising. Above all, it suggests that Iran is willing to make use of whatever hulls are available to meet its naval requirements. At the same time, presuming the Zagros is built to a higher naval standard — which is not necessarily a given — it would presumably be more survivable than a commercial hull. Once established in service, the Zagros should offer Iran a valuable means of gathering intelligence on opposing forces not only in the Persian Gulf but also farther afield, including into the Arabian Sea and the Red Sea. Here, it could be especially useful in the context of the growing hostilities between Iran and Israel, as well as the anti-shipping campaign currently being waged by the Iran-backed Houthi militia. A view of the Zagros underway, during helicopter operations. YouTube screencap/Iranian state media In recent years, however, Iran has also demonstrated a growing ability to project naval power over much greater distances. With this in mind, the Zagros might even end up making deployments to the Mediterranean Sea, from where it could also observe Israeli and other countries’ naval activities. Given the antagonism between Iran and the United States, the Zagros could also be used to monitor U.S. Navy carrier battle groups operating close to Iran or its interests. With its new signals intelligence vessel, Iran has once again taken an unexpected path to expandings its naval capabilities. However, given the current tensions between Iran and its adversaries, and the growing number of theaters in which these are being played out, the Zagros looks like it could be headed for a busy career.

New Air-Launched Cruise Missile Teased By General Atomics	General Atomics has offered a look at a new air-to-surface missile it is developing. The emergence of the project comes at a time of great and still growing interest, especially within the U.S. military, in new air-launched strike munitions, particularly ones that are cheaper and easier to produce than existing designs. A rendering of the new weapon from General Atomics' Electromagnetic Systems Group, currently referred to simply as the 'Strike Missile,' is on display at the company's booth at the Surface Navy Association's main annual symposium that kicked off this week. A company representative on the show floor could not provide TWZ with any additional information and cautioned that the name could change in the future. From what can be seen in the rendering, the slab-sided design with two lugs on top features an air-breathing propulsion system with a single ventral intake. A long rectangular strake is also visible along the body and there are four additional fins at the tail end. There are no other clear indications as yet about its size, performance, and other specifications. A picture of the Strike Missile rendering on display at General Atomics' booth at the 2025 Surface Navy Association main annual symposium. Joseph Trevithick TWZ is not aware of any past forays on General Atomics' part into the realm of traditional air-to-surface missile development. The company's website does mention past experience with developing surface-to-surface and surface-to-air munitions, including lower-cost and modular designs. Its Aeronautical Systems division also has extensive experience with air-launched drones. A rendering of the General Atomics Rapid Affordable Modular Missile (RAMM), a surface-to-air missile design. General Atomics A model of General Atomics' Eaglet, one of a number of air-launched drones the company has been developing in recent years. Howard Altman In general, as TWZ has noted in the past, the line between uncrewed aerial systems, especially longer-range kamikaze drones, and cruise missiles, as well as decoys carrying electronic warfare payloads, is increasingly blurry. A single modular design could be configured to perform different mission sets, as well. General Atomics' own Advanced Air Launched Effects (A2LE) uncrewed aerial system is a good example of the increasingly blurry line between drones, cruise missiles, and decoys. General Atomics As already mentioned, the U.S. military is very interested in acquiring new air-launched strike munitions, especially lower-cost types that can be produced readily at scale, but that also still offer appreciable range. Pursuing these kinds of weapons is increasingly seen as vital for providing sufficient strike capacity in future conflicts, especially high-end ones like a fight in the Pacific against China, and allowing for the relatively rapid replenishment of stockpiles. The U.S. Navy's Multi-Mission Affordable Capacity Effector (MACE) and U.S. Air Force's Extended Range Attack Munition (ERAM) are prime examples of new projects that have emerged just in the past year to help address these needs, following on from years of other similar efforts. The Air Force and the Pentagon’s Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) are working on another project called the Enterprise Test Vehicle (ETV), which could be a stepping stone to new lower-cost cruise missiles. General Atomics is not one of the four companies – Anduril Industries, Integrated Solutions for Systems, Inc., Leidos subsidiary Dynetics, and Zone 5 Technologies – known to have received ETV contracts. The Anduril barracuda-500M, one of the designs now being developed under the Enterprise Test Vehicle program. Anduril It also emerged last year that ERAM is primarily focused on delivering a new air-launched munition capability to Ukraine. The Pentagon has since disclosed that Denmark and the Netherlands are involved in that particular effort, as well. This underscores the additional interest in these kinds of lower-cost air-launched strike munitions that exists outside of the United States. Altogether it is unsurprising that General Atomics would be looking to enter this growing market space. In addition, having a weapon like this within the company's portfolios means it could also be pitched directly in combination with its uncrewed aircraft offerings to new and existing operators. This could be especially pertinent when it comes to existing designs like the MQ-9 Reaper that have shown to be increasingly vulnerable even to opponents with relatively limited air defense capabilities. General Atomics has previously presented a vision of the Reaper as a potential stand-off munitions 'truck,' which could be one way to try to help ensure their relevance in future conflicts. The Strike Missile might be able to fit inside internal bays, as well as under the wings, of other drone designs, including the one General Atomics is developing as part of the Air Force's Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) program.

DDG(X) Next-Generation Destroyer’s Capabilities And Costs Are Sol...	As the U.S. Navy’s next-generation destroyer, currently dubbed the DDG(X), continues through concept design stages, the service’s surface warfare director reiterated Tuesday how the future ship must be able to field a wider variety of weapons systems, while sporting nearly unprecedented levels of power production. And while questions remain about delivery schedules and cost, the Navy needs to make DDG(X) far more capable of taking on future systems and upgrades than its predecessor, the Arleigh Burke destroyer class, a design that is now officially ‘maxed out’ in terms of future growth. The Navy has remained largely mum as of late about where the DDG(X) effort currently stands, but Rear Adm. Bill Daly gave an update on the program during the Surface Navy Association’s annual conference, which TWZ attended. 'DDG(X) is a must do, operationally, tactically, for shipbuilding,' Daly said. 'The DDG(X) design is our clean-sheet imperative to update warship endurance, power production and storage, C5I [command, control, communication, computer, cyber and intelligence], and weapons technology such as hypersonics and directed energy.' Daly noted that U.S. households consume 40 percent more power than they did when the lead destroyer in the current destroyer class, USS Arleigh Burke (DDG-51) was built in the late 1980s, and that such consumption has translated to ships as well. As part of this power requirement, he said the Fiscal Year 2025 National Defense Authorization Act calls for the Navy to investigate power systems that can generate 40 megawatts of reserve power. The Navy destroyer USS Arleigh Burke (DDG-51). (U.S. Navy) 'This is a required evolution that we must get right for DDG(X), quickly,' he said, adding that the service is proceeding on testing propulsion systems at land-based sites, as required by law. USNI News reported in 2023 that a $122 million, full-scale DDG(X) integrated propulsion system would be tested at the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Philadelphia. TWZ has in the past reported what the DDG(X)’s so-called Integrated Power System (IPS) will offer: 'IPS will also be vital to meet the increased power generation demands of both directed-energy weapons and powerful sensor arrays. The technology behind IPS is the same as found in the Zumwalt class of destroyers, in which an advanced turbo-electric drive system replaces the traditional gas-turbine propulsion gear. While the Zumwalt class has not proved a success, with only three hulls completed, its propulsion system is unquestionably powerful, putting out more than 75 megawatts of power.' Daly also suggested that the exact weapons systems aboard DDG(X) remain in the works, but TWZ has reported on how they will likely include long-range surface to air and hypersonic missiles, as well as directed-energy weapons. To date, Zumwalt class are the only Navy surface combatants capable of generating such high levels of electricity and are in the midst of being outfitted with launchers to eventually fire Intermediate-Range Conventional Prompt Strike (IRCPS) hypersonic missiles. Go here to read more TWZ coverage of that effort. The Navy destroyer USS Zumwalt (DDG-1000) returned to the water last month after receiving an upgrade that will allow it to launch hypersonic missiles. (HII) 'Every time you watch an impressive video of what meshed drones can do, ask yourself, would I rather have a large-bore shotgun, a directed-energy weapon, or both for the DDG(X)?' Daly said. 'That is a required evolution that we need to get correct quickly.' Asked about when the Navy will release more about the DDG(X), Daly said he wants 'to make sure I have several parts right in that shape, and that’s what we’re doing, concept design.' Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) has not responded to TWZ queries by deadline regarding the evolution of the future warship’s design. But a LinkedIn post last month by the Navy’s Program Executive Office (PEO) Ships about an officer’s going-away party features a photo of DDG(X) on a cake, in which the Mk 45 five-inch main gun is no longer on the bow, a contrast to images released by the Navy of the future ship in the past. Naval News’ Carter Johnson was the first to report on the main gun’s absence in the DDG(X) cake rendering, which also shows a rearrangement of the Mk41 Vertical Launching System (VLS) missile modules, along with changes to the front-facing bridge windows and other modifications. At this point, it remains unclear whether the cake reflects the ship’s current design or the creative liberty of the cake maker. Either way, DDG(X) is planned as a bigger ship than its Burke brethren, displacing 13,500 tons, which is nearly 40 percent greater than the 9,700-ton displacement of the latest Flight III Arleigh Burke variant, according to a December Congressional Research Service report. While DDG(X) will host the Flight III Aegis Combat System and the high-powered AN/SPY-6 radar, also known as the Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) or Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar (EASR), DDG(X) will have more margin for growth than Flight IIIs, which means more space, weight capacity, electrical power and cooling capacity that will allow it to accommodate new higher-power equipment and directed-energy weapons over its service life, the CRS report states. The AN/SPY-6 radar aboard the Flight III Navy destroyer USS Jack H. Lucas (DDG-125). (RTX) '[The] DDG 51 Flight (FLT) III [design] is highly capable, but after over 40 years in production and 30 years of upgrades the [DDG-51] hull form does not provide sufficient space and center of gravity margin to host these future capabilities,' Navy officials told CRS. DDG(X) will also feature reduced infrared, acoustic and underwater electromagnetic signatures, increasing its survivability. It is further expected to have a greater cruising range due to fuel efficiency that will reduce its need for underway refueling. DDG(X) is planned to have an increased weapon capacity compared to its predecessor as well. 'The Navy states that the baseline DDG(X) design, like the Fight III DDG-51 design, is to include 96 standard Vertical Launch System (VLS) cells, with an ability to incorporate 12 large missile launch cells in place of 32 of the 96 standard VLS cells,' the CRS report states. 'It is also to include two 21-cell Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) launchers, and possibly also an ability to be built with an additional mid-body hull section, called the Destroyer Payload Module, that would provide additional payload capacity.' A RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) fired from the amphibious transport dock ship USS Anchorage (LPD-23). (U.S. Navy) Still, the Navy’s ambitious plans for DDG(X) are coming with a cost, even as the brass warns that China could move to invade Taiwan in the next few years, according to the CRS. The Navy’s 2025 shipbuilding plan called for production of those ships to commence in 2032, but the Navy later informed the CBO that the first ship actually wouldn’t begin production until 2034 or later. Go here to read more TWZ coverage of how the future DDG fleet in general is being impacted by cost increases and delivery delays. The Navy wants to eventually buy 28 DDG(X) ships at an average cost of $3.3 billion per vessel, a price 'driven mostly by an increase in the size and capabilities' of the future warship, according to the CBO. But given the size and new tech onboard the DDG(X), CBO’s assessment states that those ships will actually cost $4.4 billion on average. The CBO also found that Flight III costs will balloon from an average of $2.1 billion per ship to $2.5 billion per hull, with even steeper cost increases coming in the future. The Flight III Navy destroyer USS Jack H. Lucas (DDG-125). (HII) 'The uncertainty about the ultimate size and capabilities of the [DDG(X)] suggests that its final cost could differ substantially from both the Navy’s and CBO’s estimates,' the report states. As the fleet awaits further details about the DDG(X), all signs point to it being a game-changing platform in comparison to the surface fleet’s current capabilities. But what precisely it will field, and whether the Navy and industry can deliver it on time and within budget, remains to be seen.

Navy Now Seeking Commercial Ship Design To Propel Its Long-Delaye...	After years of delays procuring its own Medium Landing Ship (LSM) to ferry platoon-size elements of Marines between West Pacific islands during a war with China, the U.S. Navy is now looking to existing, private-sector designs to potentially fill this capability gap. The Navy halted its efforts to acquire the LSM last month, after an industry request for information (RFI) resulted in cost estimates that were beyond what the Navy and Marine Corps envisioned paying for the platform. Catch up on TWZ's recent reporting on the acquisition travails that have plagued the program here. But earlier this month, Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) issued a new RFI to industry seeking an existing vessel design that could be retrofitted into a LSM that would require only minor modifications to fulfill requirements. It also seeks information from shipyards regarding the capacity for such an effort if they submit information. The recently passed Fiscal Year 2025 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) 'constrained' the Navy from procuring the LSM 'as originally envisioned,' Rear Adm. William Daly, the Navy’s director of surface warfare, said Tuesday at the annual Surface Navy Association conference, which TWZ attended. 'But what it did was, the NDAA provided a unique opportunity to explore acquiring a non-developmental vessel to serve as the medium landing ship,' Daly said. 'First in class, a great opportunity, recognizing the time-critical needs of Marine Corp littoral mobility.' A rendering of the future U.S. Navy Medium Landing Ship (LSM) and its capabilities. (U.S. Navy) The new RFI, released on Jan. 6, seeks a landing ship that can conduct shore-to-shore beaching operations, while loading and unloading cargo directly onto a beach. It calls for a vessel that is shorter than 400 feet, with a 300-ton minimum cargo capacity. The request makes no mention of potential lethality or survivability upgrades that could be integrated into the existing platform. It also seeks information on beach gradients that existing vessels could handle for offloading a full load onto the beach, along with speed and endurance data, how many have been built and how quickly more could come online. Formerly known as the Light Amphibious Warship (LAW) and also referred to as the Landing Ship Medium, the LSM is envisioned as delivering forces right onto a beach without any established port facilities. It would ferry mobile, platoon-sized Marine units to islands where they would fire anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCM) at Chinese forces and collect data for other U.S. forces, among other tasks. Those Marines would also work to deter opponents in situations short of actual conflict, while helping to control littoral areas and seascapes. Such missions would be conducted by the new Marine Littoral Regiments (MLR). The operations would occur within China’s striking distance, likely in the southern Japanese islands and in the Philippines, part of a sea-denial campaign spanning the South China Sea and East China Sea, analysts told TWZ in December. LSMs are seen as a key mover of Marines under the Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations (EABO) concept, which is a major component of the Marine Corps overhaul known as Force Design 2030 that seeks to ready the service for a war with China. Part of that original vision saw the Navy and Marines moving away from a laser focus on large amphibious assault and landing ships. TWZ has extensively reported on EABO and what it means for the Corps. But opinions have differed on what the LSM should be, with the Navy wanting a more survivable vessel and the Marines looking to field the capability as quickly as possible, as some warn that China could invade Taiwan and prompt a U.S. response in the next few years. A Marine sets up defensive positions during an Expeditionary Advance Base Operation (EABO) exercise in Okinawa, Japan, in 2020. (U.S. Marine Corps) Under prior LSM concepts, the services called for between 18 to 35 LSMs that would range in length from 200 to 400 feet, with a 12-foot draft, each crewed by about 70 sailors, according to an August Congressional Research Service (CRS) report. The LSM would provide 8,000 square feet of deck cargo space and be able to carry up to 50 Marines and nearly 650 tons of equipment. Per the original plan, the LSM was to also feature a helicopter landing pad, as well as two 30mm guns and six .50-caliber machine guns for self-defense. They would have a 14-knot transit speed, a cruising range of 3,500 nautical miles, and would be expected to serve for 20 years. The Navy’s latest RFI makes no mention of the sought-after ship design hosting such capabilities, and it remains unclear if they are still part of the Navy’s LSM requirements. The Marines first introduced the idea of the LSM in 2020, but the program has suffered several stalls, with plans to acquire the first vessels initially pushed back to Fiscal Year 2023 and then to Fiscal 2025, as the Navy grapples with hefty bills for submarines and other needs, Defense News reported in 2022. The Navy began receiving initial LSM concepts from shipyards and design firms in late 2020. By January 2024, the Navy was seeking proposals for the LSM, with Marine Corps officials saying they were on pace to procure in 2025 and deliver in 2029, according to the CRS. Amidst these delays, the Marines have made do and already leaned on existing commercial and military capabilities that require little modification, according to the service. Those efforts have included Marines using stern-landing ships to inform the development of the LSM in the interim. A June 2024 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report warned that 'existing commercial designs require significant modifications to meet LSM’s requirements,' and that none of the commercial designs assessed by the Navy had the required beachability or cargo fuel capacity. 'Although not optimal, such vessels will provide both operational capability and a sound basis for live experimentation and refining detailed requirements for the LSM program,' the Corps said in a 2022 update to Force Design 2030, a reorganization of the force that seeks to better prepare it for war with China. The military has had some success buying commercial vessels and repurposing them for military use. A roll-on/roll-off cargo ship was modified to carry special operators and their gear and renamed M/V Ocean Trader, a job that TWZ reported on back in 2016. The ship has been something of a ghost since entering service, popping up in hot spots around the globe. The M/V Ocean Trader, a shadowy U.S. special operations seabase ship, was initially a roll-on/roll-off cargo ship that was bought and modified by the military. (David Kozdron) The British Royal Navy has undertaken similar efforts in recent years, and China has also used civilian ferries to move its amphibious forces and launch amphibious craft during beach invasion drills. Turning commercial ships into helicopter carriers is also something China’s training to do during a major contingency operation.

But USNI News’ Mallory Shelbourne first reported the latest LSM setback on Dec. 17, citing comments by Navy leadership. 'We put it out for bid and it came back with a much higher price tag,' USNI News quoted Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development, and Acquisition Nickolas Guertin as saying at an American Society of Naval Engineers symposium last month. 'We simply weren’t able to pull it off. So we had to pull that solicitation back and drop back and punt.' Guertin noted that the service had what they thought was a 'bulletproof' cost estimate, and a 'pretty well wrung out design in terms of requirements, independent cost estimates,' USNI News reported. The Navy’s proposed Fiscal Year 2025 budget requests show the first LSM would cost $268 million, but costs would average out to roughly $156 million by the seventh and eighth ship, according to the Congressional Research Service (CRS). A U.S. defense official speaking on condition of anonymity told TWZ last month that initial plans called for each ship to cost between $100 million and $150 million, but that the Navy added features to meet their requirements, and that shot the price of each ship up dramatically. The Marines wanted a ship that was less exquisite and more numerous, according to the official. An Austal rendering of a medium landing ship. (Austal) The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) said in April that Navy estimates for the LSM’s cost have 'varied widely.' CBO’s own analysis found the LSM could cost $340 million to $430 million per ship for an 18-ship program, an estimate it said reflects the range of full-load displacements – 4,500 tons to 5,400 tons – in preliminary designs that shipbuilders submitted to the Navy. The Navy looking at existing ship designs for its LSM mission, and the program’s delays so far, highlight a longstanding tension between the Navy and Marine Corps. The Marines need certain maritime capabilities for amphibious operations. The Navy is tasked with moving those Marines, but must pay for the ships the Marines need. Similar debates have surfaced around the size of the larger-deck amphibious fleet in recent years as well. The amphibious force is 'not the favorite thing of the Navy to deal with,' Bradley Martin, a retired Navy surface warfare officer who spent two-thirds of his 30-year career at sea, told TWZ last month. 'I say this as a guy who spent a number of years on the amphibs,' said Martin, now a senior policy researcher with the RAND think tank. 'The Marines aren’t very worried about how the Navy sustains ships, and the Navy hasn’t been really clear about what it takes to sustain ships. There’s been that disconnect.' Navy and Marine Corps brass are united in sounding the alarm about China’s ascending military capabilities, and how Beijing could move to invade Taiwan as soon as 2027. The LSM is framed as a key enabler for Marines to contribute to a Pacific fight. But whether the Navy going back to the drawing board once again will get such a LSM out to the fleet in a quicker, more affordable way remains to be seen. geoff@twz.com	https://www.twz.com/news-features/navy-now-seeking-commercial-ship-design-to-propel-its-long-delayed-medium-landing-ship-program-forward	2025-01-15T13:09:10-08:00	https://www.twz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Medium-Marine-Landing-Ship-copy.jpg?quality=85
Gaza Ceasefire Agreed To, Final Israeli Approval Pending	Israeli and Hamas officials have reached a deal to bring an end to the fighting in Gaza and to exchange Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners. News of the deal has been confirmed by Hamas, Qatari, and U.S. officials, although Israel is yet to make a statement. The deal, however, is contingent on approval by Israel's cabinet, which is reportedly preparing to meet and ratify it, amid rightwing threats to bring Benjamin Netanyahu’s government down if it is approved. The news that the bloody conflict, which began on October 7, 2023, with a surprise attack on Israel by Hamas, could be coming to an end emerged as Israeli airstrikes on Gaza continued. Overall, the death toll in the conflict has exceeded 47,000 people, the overwhelming majority of them Palestinian, according to United Nations figures. BREAKING: Israel and Hamas have reached an agreement on a ceasefire and hostage release deal, a US official and an Arab official tells The Times of Israel. An announcement is expected in the coming hours, an Arab official adds.&mdash; Jacob Magid (@JacobMagid) January 15, 2025 'The deal is expected to deliver an initial six-week halt to fighting that is to be accompanied by the opening of negotiations on ending the war altogether,' The Associated Press reported. It involves the gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, the phased release of hostages held by Hamas, and the release of hundreds of Palestinian detainees held by Israel. The Israeli military has already codenamed the operation to start returning the hostages Wings of Freedom. The name Sparrow Wings has also been reported, which may be another translation.

According to a Hamas official, the group’s leader, Khalil al-Hayya delivered approval of the ceasefire agreement to mediators from Qatar and Egypt in Doha, the Qatari capital. The deal was hammered out in meetings hosted by Qatar’s prime minister, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, alongside negotiators from Hamas and Israel. According to the BBC, 98 hostages remain in Hamas captivity. Otherwise, it’s expected that the deal will allow hundreds of thousands of people displaced in Gaza to return to their homes and help bring badly needed humanitarian aid into Gaza.

According to that official, the issue involved the Philadelphi corridor — a strip of land roughly nine miles long, and 100 yards wide, along Gaza’s border with Egypt, including the Rafah crossing. AP reports that Hamas was unhappy with the arrangements for the strategic corridor, specifically the maps that were approved by the Israeli cabinet, although this seems to have been resolved.

Earlier today, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denied initial reports that Hamas had agreed to an outline deal for a limited release of hostages, a ceasefire, and partial withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. 'Contrary to reports, the Hamas terror organization has not yet returned its response to the deal,' the prime minister’s office said. Meanwhile, Israeli airstrikes continued in the past 24 hours in Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces on its official Telegram channel claimed that yesterday it struck 'more than 50 terrorist targets across the Gaza Strip, including terrorist cells, weapons storage facilities, underground infrastructure, anti-tank fire positions, and Hamas military structures.' Over the past day, the Israeli Air Force carried out airstrikes on over 50 targets in the Gaza Strip, the military says, including against groups of operatives from the Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad terror groups.One of the strikes, launched overnight, targeted a… pic.twitter.com/qkKCU1ALVv&mdash; Emanuel (Mannie) Fabian (@manniefabian) January 15, 2025 Al Jazeera reported today that overnight Israeli attacks in Gaza had killed 24, including two people 'in an Israeli drone attack on Khirbet al-Adas area, north of the city of Rafah.' Overall, the ceasefire agreement has essentially been on the table since May of last year. Hamas's position has been weakened significantly since then. In addition, The Washingon Post, citing a diplomat briefed on the ceasefire negotiations, credited progress in the talks in part to the influence of President-elect Donald Trump, saying it was 'the first time there has been real pressure on the Israeli side to accept a deal.' More broadly, the conflict that began on October 7, 2023, has also radically reshaped the geopolitical landscape in the Middle East. It has also seen Israel decimate Hezbollah in Lebanon and by going after proxy groups like these, this has dramatically weakened Iran's influence over the region, a dynamic that has been reinforced by the fall of the Assad regime in Syria. Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen do also continue to launch attacks on Israel, as well as on foreign warships and commercial vessels in and around the Red Sea. Shiite militias in Iraq are also still in play. As for Gaza, there are now big questions about how the territory will be rebuilt and how it will be governed. While the pre-war Hamas leadership has been taken out and its forces greatly weakened, there is plenty of resentment against Israel which could help the group to reconstitute or something else take its place. This is a developing story. We will update it as more news comes in about this deal.

Norwegian F-35s Scrambled In Poland During Russian Missile Strike...	Norway has confirmed to The War Zone that it scrambled two of its F-35A stealth fighters, currently deployed in Poland, overnight, coincident with large-scale Russian missile strikes on Ukraine. While the Norwegian jets are primarily in Poland to help defend a key logistics hub bringing materiel into Ukraine, rogue Russian missiles and drones have entered Polish airspace several times since the full-scale invasion began. 'On Wednesday night, two Norwegian F-35A fighter jets ‘scrambled’ in Polish airspace,' Lt. Col. Eivind Byre, the Royal Norwegian Air Force (RNoAF) head of communications, told us in an email. Norwegian F-35s in Poznań-Krzesiny, Poland, as part of Norway’s contribution to NATO’s integrated air and missile defense. Polish Air Force Polish Air Force The quick reaction alert (QRA) scramble was apparently prompted by Russia’s latest barrage of missile strikes on Ukraine. Byre also told the Forsvarets Forum website, covering Norwegian defense matters, that the RNoAF fighters were scrambled 'in connection with the war in Ukraine, to protect Polish airspace as part of NATO.' According to a statement from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, by 11:00 a.m. local time today, Russia had launched over 40 missiles and more than 70 drones against Ukraine, targeting gas infrastructure and energy facilities. Zelensky claimed that at least 30 of the missiles were successfully intercepted. The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said that Russian attacks on energy facilities, especially gas infrastructure in the Kharkiv, Lviv, and Ivano-Frankivsk regions 'caused significant damage.' A local resident whose house was destroyed stands next to a crater following a missile strike on the village of Sknyliv, some 37 miles from Lviv, on January 15, 2025, after Russia launched dozens of missiles and drones at the Ukrainian energy sector. Photo by YURIY DYACHYSHYN / AFP YURIY DYACHYSHYN The respective heads of the regional administrations in the Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk regions said there were no casualties in the strikes. Ukraine’s national grid operator said today it had introduced emergency power cuts in six regions after what it described as a 'massive' Russian missile strike. The Russian attacks were reportedly spearheaded by more than a dozen Tu-95MS Bear and Tu-22M3 Backfire strategic bombers launching air-launched cruise missiles, although Kinzhal aero-ballistic missiles, delivered by adapted MiG-31 Foxhound interceptors, are also said to have been used. The Russian strategic bombers are said to have taken off from the air base at Olenya in the Murmansk region. There are reports that none were launched from Engels in the Volgograd region — an airfield that has been hit by multiple Ukrainian drones in recent days. A strategically important fuel farm supplying Engels Air Base was struck by Ukrainian drones last week. via X Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff Reportedly, Kalibr subsonic cruise missiles were also fired from Russian Navy vessels in the Black Sea. The Russian missile and drone barrage came a day after Ukraine launched what was described as its largest aerial assault on Russian territory since the start of the full-scale invasion. You can read more about this here, suffice it to say that targets were hit at locations between 125 to 700 miles deep into Russian territory, in the Bryansk, Saratov, and Tula regions and the Republic of Tatarstan. Factories and energy infrastructure appear to have been the main targets. Following the Ukrainian attacks, Russia’s military said yesterday that it would retaliate, further claiming that six U.S.-supplied Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) and six U.K.-supplied Storm Shadow cruise missiles had been used by Ukraine. With most of the missiles and drones apparently targeting the western regions of Ukraine, including the Lviv region that borders Poland, it makes sense that the Norwegian F-35s were launched while on QRA duty. It’s unclear whether any Russian missiles or drones entered Polish airspace, or if they were just headed toward it. The RNoAF declined to answer this question, instead passing it over to NATO, which has yet to respond to us. A Norwegian F-35As lands at Ørland Air Base, Norway, in December 2024. Norwegian Ministry of Defense Milla Saus Johansen / Forsvaret In the past, Poland has said that Russian missiles have entered its airspace after being launched from the St. Petersburg area against Ukrainian targets near the western city of Lviv. These missiles then traversed Belarus and entered Polish airspace for about 40 seconds before turning toward their targets in Ukraine. Of course, this provides only a very limited reaction time, should Poland decide to intercept them. The threat that the Russian missiles pose to Poland shouldn’t be underestimated. In November 2022, two Polish citizens were killed by falling debris when Ukraine shot down a Russian missile near the Polish border using a surface-to-air missiles. Aerial view taken on November 17, 2022, shows the site where a missile strike killed two men in the eastern Poland village of Przewodow, near the border with Ukraine on November 15, 2022. Photo by WOJTEK RADWANSKI,DAMIEN SIMONART/AFP via Getty Images WOJTEK RADWANSKI In December 2022, Polish authorities reported a Russian cruise missile — apparently unarmed, or at least failing to detonate — coming down near the northern city of Bydgoszcz, around 311 miles from the Belarusian border, without causing any casualties. Another military object, later reported to be a Russian cruise missile, was found in a forest close to the village of Zamosc near the northern city of Bydgoszcz, in April 2023. Polish authorities also suspected a Russian drone of entering its airspace in August last year, determining that it may have landed on Ukrainian territory after it likely strayed off course during a Russian attack on Ukraine. Last September, Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski said his country and other nations bordering Ukraine have a 'duty' to shoot down incoming Russian missiles before they enter their airspace. 'Membership in NATO does not trump each country’s responsibility for the protection of its own airspace — it’s our own constitutional duty,' Sikorski told the Financial Times. 'I’m personally of the view that, when hostile missiles are on course of entering our airspace, it would be legitimate self-defense [to intercept them] because once they do cross into our airspace, the risk of debris injuring someone is significant.' NATO, however, opposed the idea, with its then secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, saying it risked the alliance 'becoming part of the conflict.' Nevertheless, NATO has bolstered Poland’s air defenses, including the current Norwegian deployment there. -fighters-and-air-defenses-head-to-poland%2F Since early December last year, Norway has deployed four F-35As at the air base at Poznań-Krzesiny and also has a National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS) air defense system in the country, all part of a contingent that includes around 100 Polish soldiers. The Norwegian deployment is officially there to help defend the most critical logistics hub for military support to Ukraine, Rzeszów Airport in southeastern Poland. 'Ukraine remains in critical need of military support, with Poland as the most critical logistics hub. Starting early December, Norway will assume air defense responsibility for the most important hub for the transport of both civilian and military material from other countries to Ukraine,' Norwegian Minister of Defense Bjørn Arild Gram said at the time, adding that the airport also plays a vital role in medical evacuation efforts on behalf of Ukraine. A Norwegian NASAMS launcher, in the foreground, with a Patriot surface-to-air missile launcher and a Canadian C-130Jtransport, at Rzeszów Airport. Norwegian Ministry of Defense Ole Andreas Vekve / Forsvaret The Norwegian mission is due to end around April of this year, after which another NATO member will assume responsibility. So far, reports suggest that only the United States has committed to the rotational deployments. While we await more details of today’s F-35 scramble, it is notable that the incident comes on the same day as Poland calls upon Europe to 'take responsibility' for its own security, ahead of the U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration next week and the uncertainty that brings in terms of support for NATO — and for Ukraine. 'There is awareness among European countries that the next few months will be a very difficult time … That’s why we think that this particular moment is the right time to say loudly that it’s time to take responsibility for our future and our security,' Poland’s Europe Minister, Adam Szłapka, told the Guardian. Meanwhile, as long as the conflict in Ukraine rages, Poland remains very much a frontline state, and breaches of its airspace by Russian millies and drones will still be a threat. With that in mind, deployments of NATO fighters and air defense systems to the country provide a valuable additional line of defense and one that Warsaw will hope continues.

This follows the emergence of satellite imagery showing multiple similar, but different jack-up barges in various stages of construction at a shipyard in southeastern China. The Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) has been increasingly demonstrating its ability to leverage ostensibly non-military maritime assets to support amphibious operations, especially a possible invasion of Taiwan. The picture in question looks to have first begun circulating on social media earlier today, but where or when it was taken is unclear. Independent naval analyst H.I. Sutton, writing for Naval News, was first to report last week on the construction of new jack-up barges at Guangzhou Shipyard International (GSI) on Longxue Island just southeast of the city of Guangzhou. GSI is a subsidiary of the state-run China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC). An illustration of the approach for PLA over the beach-landing tests and training. The vessel connecting the ferry to the pontoons is not one of the recently revealed new designs, but obviously related in overall concept.

This, in turn, would provide an added margin of safety. The U.S. military's brief use of a temporary pier system to try to help increase the flow of humanitarian in the Gaza Strip last year underscored the potential vulnerability of such structures just to severe weather. A squall broke apart that pier, which did not feature a jack-up barge, after less than two weeks of operations and it took more than a week to get it usable again. Poor weather continued to dog its operations afterward. The Chinese barge seen in the image circulating online now has at least two prominent jack-up legs at one end, but whether it has additional supports elsewhere is unclear. This is distinctly different from what is seen in the recent satellite imagery of GSI's yard on Longxue Island, where barges with four, six, and eight jack-up legs are visible. At least some of those barges have their own built-in ramps, which could negate the need for a temporary pier/causeway system entirely in certain circumstances. This could also help make it faster and easier to establish these ship-to-shore nodes.

The barges are similar to the Mulberry harbors constructed for the Normandy invasion. pic.twitter.com/664NdDrqXo&mdash; Edward Conard (@EdwardConard) January 13, 2025 It is important to note that jack-up barges are not new, nor is their use in combination with temporary pier/causeway systems. A particularly well-known military example of this is the employment of so-called Mulberry harbors by Allied forces following the D-Day landings in Normandy, France during World War II. The PLA has itself been demonstrating its ability to use semi-submersible and jack-up barges as intermodal nodes between ships, including ostensibly commercial RO/RO ferries, and temporary piers/causeways for at least a decade. Some of the jack-up barges that have been employed in previous experiments and exercises look very similar to the one seen in the image now circulating on social media. This raises the possibility that the 'new' picture was taken some time ago.

In addition, last year, GSI launched a still very curious ship featuring a large open flight deck, but with commercial-style rather than military markings, seen in the social media post below and that you can read more about here.

Via 这丫头有点风/Wb. pic.twitter.com/aV9ffBAgUB&mdash; Alex Luck (@AlexLuck9) January 14, 2025 It is possible that the new jack-up barges under construction at GSI's yard now could ostensibly be non-military in nature. At the same time, the presence of the integrated ramps points more to ship-to-shore connectors with clear military applications. Regardless, all of this underscores the thin and often non-existent line between the PLA and commercial and civilian enterprises in China. As already noted, the PLAN has been increasingly utilizing RO/RO ferries and other commercial maritime assets in amphibious exercises for years now. The PLAN has been steadily and significantly expanding the size and scope of its organic amphibious warfare fleets, but commercial capabilities are clearly still viewed as offering valuable additional capacity. Though ships built to commercial standards would be more vulnerable, the added capacity could still be very useful for supporting an invasion of Taiwan, especially after an initial bridgehead is established. The PLAN could make use of a hybrid military/civilian amphibious force for future military operations elsewhere, as well as for disaster relief and humanitarian assistance activities at home and abroad. The PLA has also used commercial RO/RO ferries for routine peacetime maritime logistics purposes in the South China Sea. 'The PRC’s [People's Republic of China's] amphibious fleet has, in recent years, focused on acquiring a modest number of ocean-going LPDs [landing platform dock] and LHAs [amphibious assault] ships. There is no indication the PRC is significantly expanding its number of tank landing ships and medium-sized landing craft at this time,' according to the Pentagon's most recent annual report on Chinese military developments, released in December. 'Although the PLAN has not invested in the large number of landing ships and medium landing craft that analysts believe the PLA would need for a large-scale assault on Taiwan, it is possible the PLA assesses it has sufficient amphibious capacity and has mitigated shortfalls through investment in other operational capabilities, such as civilian lift vessels and rotary-wing assets to address this gap. The PLA may have confidence in the PRC’s shipbuilding industry’s massive capacity to produce the necessary ship-to-shore connectors relatively quickly.' 'An over-the-shore capability like the floating causeway will be a critical capability in a Taiwan invasion, giving the PLA the capability to bypass damaged or sabotaged ports and harbors with an independent, relocatable off-shore loading and unloading capability,' a report from the independent China Maritime Studies Institute published last year explains. 'At least through 2030, the PLA’s reserve civilian merchant fleet is probably unable to provide significant amphibious landing capabilities or the maritime logistics in austere or challenging environments necessary to support a large-scale, cross-strait invasion of Taiwan. That said, if current trends in training and exercises continue, the PLA may be able to effectively leverage civil maritime shipping on a large enough scale to support a major amphibious operation by the mid-2030’s.' 'In the first wave of an assault the Chinese navy’s traditional amphibious assault ships could deliver roughly one heavy brigade’s worth of equipment (though likely spread over a larger number of lighter amphibious brigades) and about 21,000 troops. This pales in comparison to the capacity of its civilian fleet,' Tom Shugart, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) think tank, wrote in a piece for War On The Rocks back in 2022. 'For my calculations, I considered only those ferries owned by companies that are either — like the Bo Hai Ferry Company — known to be organized as maritime militia strategic support fleets, or whose ships have taken part in previous military exercises. These ferries could deliver more than two additional heavy brigades’ worth of equipment, with amphibious vehicles delivered directly to the beach with modified ramps, while other vehicles could be delivered via temporary beach causeways or captured ports. If temporary piers or captured ports were available for China’s military-associated vehicle carriers, they could deliver at least five more heavy brigades’ worth of equipment.' 3c. &#8230;and if China can set up temporary piers for its PLA-associated pure vehicle carriers, or capture a port, they could deliver 5 more brigades in one trip. pic.twitter.com/3LdBIF5nH1&mdash; Tom Shugart (@tshugart3) October 12, 2022 There continue to be acute fears that the PLA could launch a military intervention against Taiwan before the end of the decade. However, the U.S. military has more recently downplayed the possibility of China's armed forces being in a position to successfully launch such an operation by 2027, if not sooner. American authorities have long said that is the year that Chinese President Xi Jinping has directed the PLA to be ready for action across the Taiwan Strait. 'The PLA regularly identifies shortcomings in the force’s warfighting and command capabilities in official media. These critiques guide its modernization efforts,' the Pentagon's China military power report released in December notes. 'Despite its rapid progress, the force has not yet demonstrated the type and scale of sophisticated urban warfare or long-distance logistics capabilities that would likely be required for operations against Taiwan or major contingencies overseas.' 'As we look at these operational challenges that the PLA is seeking to resolve, to the extent that their particular goal is to be feeling ready and confident that they can execute a short, sharp invasion of Taiwan at acceptable costs, they're not there today,' Ely Ratner, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs, said at an event that the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) think tank hosted that same month. 'They're trying to get there. &#8230; But it's not clear they're getting any closer than they were over the last couple of years.' The PLAN is certainly only continuing to increase its use of commercial capabilities, including jack-up barges and RO/RO ferries, to bolster the kind of amphibious capacity needed for a Taiwan intervention, and that could also be valuable for operations elsewhere.

Navy Just Disclosed How Many Of Each Of Its Surface-To-Air Missil...	The U.S. Navy’s surface fleet has fired nearly 400 individual munitions while battling Iran-backed Houthi rebels in the Red Sea over the past 15 months. That includes the firing of 120 SM-2 missiles, 80 SM-6 missiles, 160 rounds from destroyers and cruisers’ five-inch main guns, as well as a combined 20 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles (ESSM) and SM-3 missiles. That unprecedented disclosure of munition expenditures was revealed by the head of Naval Surface Forces, Vice Adm. Brendan McLane, during the annual Surface Navy Association conference on Tuesday, which TWZ attended. The remarks by McLane and other Navy brass offered fresh insight into what sailors are facing in the Red Sea, beyond the generalized U.S. Central Command press releases that often only offer very limited details of a given day’s kinetic events, if information is released at all. All told, Navy ships, aircraft and submarines have engaged more than 400 Houthi aerial drones, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles since October 2023, when the Yemen-based group began attacking vessels transiting the Red Sea in solidarity with the Palestinian militant group Hamas. The Navy destroyer USS Carney (DDG-64) fires a surface-to-air missile at Houthi threats on October 19, 2023. (U.S. Navy) McLane’s munitions rundown reflects the array of layered defenses found aboard a modern American warship. With a range out to 90 nautical miles and an altitude of 65,000 feet, at least according to its manufacturer, the SM-2 is considered the Navy’s cornerstone surface-to-air munition, providing area defense against anti-ship missiles and aircraft. The SM-6 is the only munition that can perform anti-air, anti-surface, land attack and terminal ballistic missile defense missions, while the SM-3 intercepts ballistic missiles during the midcourse portion of their flight and the ESSM offers robust protection against aerial threats from close to medium range. McLane's SM-3 tally likely includes missiles fired to defend Israel from an Iranian ballistic missile attack in April 2024. A destroyer’s Mk 45 five-inch main gun is normally leveled against surface opponents and shore targets, but has anti-air capability as well. While McLane’s rundown during a panel with other Navy leaders raise further questions about the expenditure of finite American munitions in that campaign, panel brass pointed out the analytic and collaborative leaps and bounds that have occurred across communities since the fight began in October 2023, cooperation they say will serve the fleet well in America’s next conflict. A full breakdown of what each of these weapons cost can be seen in the exclusive TWZ video below: Top U.S. military leaders have also in recent months expressed concern that munitions fired in the Red Sea and elsewhere are 'eating into' critical munitions stockpiles needed for a future Pacific fight with China, and the sea service has sought extra funding from Congress in the past year to restore these depleted stocks. On Tuesday, McLane, known in the community as 'SWO Boss' cited the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Spruance (DDG-111) as an example of what sailors are facing in those waters. The warship got home from a Red Sea deployment with the USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72) Carrier Strike Group (CSG) in December. 'They were in a fight where they shot down three anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBM), three anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCM) and seven one-way [unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs],' McLane said. 'So that’s how it kind of rolls up.' The combat capabilities on such warships are controlled by a Combat Information Center (CIC), manned by sailors and officers who are being tested in ways a CIC has never been tested before, as TWZ reported earlier this month. USS Carney (DDG 64) sailors in the warship's combat information center while deployed to the Red Sea in 2023. (U.S. Navy) McLane added that the Navy’s missile expenditure in the conflict is within 'the historical norm.' 'We’ve done the analysis with what we used to shoot in World War II, and we’re at about two rounds per incoming missile,' McLane said. Later in the day, during a speech on the state of the surface fleet that TWZ attended, McLane emphasized that warship commanding officers are not worried about munitions cost, 'nor should they be.' 'They have other things to worry about, like what’s for breakfast,' he said. 'The cost of the missile that they are going to shoot is not one of the things that they are worried about.' McLane added that 'more modest threats' like aerial attack drones are being engaged with a destroyer’s five-inch main gun and electronic countermeasures, along with fixed and rotary-wing aircraft. A Navy warship's five-inch main gun in action. (U.S. Navy) These fresh insights come as the Navy continues to battle Houthi barrages on an at-times daily basis, and as fact-finding continues into how the Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Gettysburg (CG-64) came to shoot down a U.S. F/A-18 Super Hornet last month during a sustained Houthi attack. The ship and jet involved were assigned to the USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75) CSG, the fourth strike group to operate in those waters since October 2023, and one that had only recently arrived in theater. While precise official details of the Dec. 22 shootdown remain scant, Vice Chief of Naval Operations Adm. James Kilby said during the conference that three separate investigations have been launched to find out what happened. One is a so-called 'JAGMAN' investigation, an administrative probe that assembles the details around an incident for potential administrative or judicial action if the higher-ups deem it necessary. The second investigation into the friendly-fire incident is conducting an assessment of the ships deployed with the Truman, while the third is a Naval Safety Command-helmed effort. 'We understand that our forces, families and supporting commands also have many questions,' Kilby said. 'However, to maintain the sanctity of the process, we will not be taking questions after this panel. We are committed to understanding what happened on Dec. 22, and more broadly, we're committed to being a deliberate learning organization.' In recent days, the Houthis have claimed that they conducted a nine-hour attack on the Truman CSG, forcing it to leave the Red Sea, according to media reports. U.S. Central Command has not commented on the alleged Jan. 11 attack, but has posted photos of the Truman and its strike group at sea on Monday. The Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75) sails with the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Jason Dunham (DDG 109), left, and the Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser USS Gettysburg (CG 64) in the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility. pic.twitter.com/iMydE5y40S&mdash; U.S. Central Command (@CENTCOM) January 13, 2025 'I want to reiterate that the Red Sea remains a dynamic environment,' Kilby said. 'We will continue to learn from [the Gettysburg shootdown], the incidents every single day. We learn more from our shortcomings than our successes.' As the Navy’s surface fleet has continued to battle the Houthis, the community is learning lessons from each and every engagement in near-real time, Kilby noted. 'When I was a young fire control officer on [USS Philippine Sea (CG-58)], I remember sending away [Aegis Combat System] tapes, physically, that means by mail, and waiting months for those tapes to be analyzed and returned to the ship,' he said. 'Generally, we could not remember the specificity and the actions we took, or what happened.' But today, terabytes of ship data from a given Red Sea engagement is sent to other Navy agencies and industry partners and processed within 48 hours, providing the ship’s command and the surface fleet at large with fresh insight on what did and did not work, McLane said. The Navy destroyer USS Mason (DDG-87) conducts a vertical replenishment with the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN-69) in the Red Sea in January 2024. (U.S. Navy) 'I think the first time we had an engagement in the Red Sea, it took about 40 days' to analyze ship data, he said. 'Now it’s 48 hours, plus a few more to get the final checks done. It touches everything in our surface warfare ecosystem.' McLane likened the effort to NFL coaching staffs watching tape of the last game. Lessons learned are shared with the ship, the surface community and technical experts. 'Human memory is fallible,' McLane said. 'Sometimes you don’t exactly remember what happened, or you think you remember what happened. We get a taste of that data so that we can reconstruct exactly what happened.' A combat information center aboard a modernized U.S. Navy cruiser. (U.S. Navy) Sometimes those post-game assessments reveal an issue at the software level, and specialists are flown to the ship to ensure that the software is uploaded correctly, while other lessons involve reinforcing the right buttons to press in a certain scenario, he said. A 'Red Sea Syllabus' is used to prepare units about to deploy in those waters, and is updated regularly so that every ship has the latest information before entering the area. The head of Naval Air Forces, Vice Adm. Daniel Cheever, also noted Tuesday that cooperation and coordination between the surface and aviation communities has drastically increased since the Red Sea battle began. Collaboration at speed has become key when preparing a ship or squadron for the Houthi threat. That speed was on display last year, as the Navy raced to equip its Super Hornet jets flying over the Red Sea with AIM-9X Sidewinder short-range missiles for shooting down Houthi drones, TWZ reported. An AIM-9X Sidewinder missile configuration for the Navy Super Hornet and Growler. 'It's really the hours and days instead of weeks and months, that's what we weren't 100% ready for,' Cheever said. 'The speed of this thing is minute, hours, days, maybe, but days is even probably late to need as we work this thing.' The Air Boss also expressed confidence that the Navy will take these Red Sea lessons into America’s next conflict. 'We're not just looking at the Red Sea, we're looking at how this applies to the future of warfighting, and how we need to learn,' Cheever said. 'When you look at what's happened over these 14 months and beyond, it gives me great confidence for what the future holds for any future fight.' A year ago, TWZ detailed exactly this — unprecedented learning opportunity and real danger that prolonged combat in the Red Sea presents. This is now playing out exactly in the manner laid out, but, as we saw with the Super Hornet shoot down, the longer this goes on, the more chance there is for a major catastrophe, and the enemy is learning too.
