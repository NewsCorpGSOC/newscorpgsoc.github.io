Battle-Proven NASAMS Air Defense Systems Approved For Taiwan	Taiwan is lining up to become the next customer for the combat-proven National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS) air defense system after the United States approved its sale to the country. The introduction of the system would be a considerable boost to Taiwan as it seeks to bolster its air defenses in the face of the growing and increasingly advanced nature of the threat posed by Chinese aircraft, missiles, and drones. As is typically the case for major U.S. arms sales, the Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) announced the State Department’s approval of the NASAMS package for Taiwan last week. The possible Foreign Military Sale could be valued at up to $1.16 billion. The proposed deal consists of three NASAMS systems, each of which includes an AN/MPQ-64F1 Sentinel radar. Other related hardware comprises an undisclosed number of fire distribution centers (FDC), canister launcher systems (CLS), electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) systems, and tactical control center (TCC) systems. The systems will be provided with up to 123 AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles-Extended Range (AMRAAM-ER). Designed specifically for NASAMS, the AMRAAM-ER combines elements of the RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) and newer versions of the AIM-120 AMRAAM. The resulting missile offers a significant boost in maximum range and engagement altitude over a standard AIM-120 fired from a NASAMS launcher. You can read more about the AMRAAM-ER and its capabilities here. Armed with standard AMRAAMs, NASAMS is capable of engaging targets from relatively close ranges to up to roughly 20 miles away and from around 1,000 feet to 50,000 feet, making it notably flexible. Leveraging the ESSM’s motor and control section reportedly increases the engagement range by about 50 percent and increases the ceiling by 70 percent. AMRAAM-ER undergoing wind tunnel testing.

Related equipment in the package includes Multifunctional Information Distribution Systems (MIDS) and MIDS Link 16-capable radios, radar communication nodes, IPS-250X High Assurance Internet Protocol Encryptions (HAIPE), KIV-77 identification friend-or-foe (IFF) systems; AN/PSN-13 Defense Advanced Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers (DAGR), and more. It should be noted that approved foreign arms sales announced through DSCA are not final and are subject to change, including as a result of negotiations between the country in question and relevant defense contractors. According to a statement from the DSCA, 'The proposed sale will improve the recipient’s capability to meet current and future threats by contributing to the recipient’s abilities to defend its airspace, provide regional security, and increase interoperability with the United States through its NASAMS program.' AMRAAM-ER undergoing a test firing from a NASAMS box launcher. Kongsberg 'This proposed sale serves U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient’s continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability. The proposed sale will help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance, and economic progress in the region,' the DSCA adds. As we have examined in the past, in relation to the transfer of NASAMS to Ukraine, this is a medium-range air defense system that can engage a variety of aerial threats. The system is especially useful for intercepting cruise missiles and one-way attack drones, weapons that China would use if it were to conduct strikes against targets in Taiwan. It also has a very limited capability against short-range ballistic missiles under certain circumstances. NASAMS has a modular architecture that allows for the use of a number of different radars and other sensors, as well as launchers, in a single battery, depending on the variant, all tied to a central fire distribution center. The system can be integrated into a larger integrated air defense system (IADS) consisting of disparate sensors and weapons, which is especially useful for Taiwan and its demanding requirements vis-à-vis the Chinese threat. Another huge advantage of NASAMS, and one we have discussed in great detail before, is its ability to fire ubiquitous AMRAAMs. A NASAMS launcher firing an AMRAAM-ER missile. Raytheon In fact, the primary armament for NASAMS is the exact same AIM-120 AMRAAMs used around the world by fighter aircraft in air-to-air applications. There is no requirement for a special AMRAAM variant or major modifications to existing missiles. In this way, Taiwan’s NASAMS can also be provided with ‘effectors’ direct from the existing stocks of missiles used by Republic of China Air Force (ROCAF) F-16 fighters. In addition, NASAMS is able to fire infrared-homing AIM-9X Sidewinder and IRIS-T missiles, the former of which is also used by the ROCAF’s upgraded F-16V fighters.

According to reports, the ROCAF has around 300-400 AMRAAMs to arm its F-16s, insufficient to counter the huge Chinese aerial threat. With a fleet of around 140 F-16s, this would provide for just over two missiles per aircraft. In times of particular tension, therefore, Taiwan would be expected to place emergency orders with the United States for more AMRAAMs and other critical munitions. But could those weapons even reach Taiwan in time if a major conflict were to erupt?

The first batch of AIM-120C-5s had been delivered by late 2003, with another sale of AIM-120C-7s being approved in 2007. Should China and Taiwan go to war, there exists the possibility, at least, to feed the NASAMS using a vast global stockpile of AMRAAMs to support the kind of high-intensity conflict that this would involve. NASAMS is far from a total solution for Taiwan, especially with just three systems currently in the country’s sights. Once procured, it will form part of a multi-layered integrated air defense system that is an absolutely fundamental component of Taiwan’s ability to defend against an aerial attack from China should Beijing ever go on the offensive against the island, which it sees as a breakaway province. A Taiwanese F-16 fighter shadows a cruise-missile-carrying PLA Air Force H-6K bomber that had approached the island of Taiwan. Military News Agency, ROC Among the key Chinese threats that NASAMS could help defend against are land-attack cruise missiles, which could be launched from bombers, submarines, and surface combatants, as well as from ground-based launchers. They would likely be used to try and knock out Taiwanese air bases and other key military infrastructure across the island. Then there is the growing threat posed by Chinese drones. These are increasingly being tested in swarms, which would be a huge challenge for Taiwan’s defenses. As well as being used for one-way attack missions, drones would likely also be used for surveillance missions, locating targets for stand-off strikes, as well as employing electronic warfare jammers, or even systems able to launch cyber attacks to confuse and overwhelm the island’s defenses, or simply harass Taiwanese forces.

The last of the HAWKS were formally retired in 2023, after which Taiwan reportedly agreed to provide Ukraine with some of these upgraded systems.

The Tien Kung I has a maximum range of 63 miles and can only engage aircraft targets but can be deployed in vertical-launch silos at fixed sites and on mobile trailer launchers. The Tien Kung II offers around twice the range and can also engage cruise missiles but is only deployed in silos. Finally, the Tien Kung III has a reported range of 125 miles and is primarily an anti-ballistic missile (ABM) system, broadly equivalent to the U.S.-made Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system. Taiwan also operates U.S.-supplied Patriot Advanced Capability 2 and 3 (PAC-2 and PAC-3) systems, which provide additional ABM capabilities and long-range air defense against a broad range of threats.

The country also uses a unique version of the Skyguard air defense system that combines Oerlikon 35mm guns, firing Advanced Hit Efficiency and Destruction (AHEAD) ammunition with RIM-7 Sea Sparrow missiles.

SAM YEH/AFP via Getty Images SAM YEH Most likely, Taiwan’s NASAMS would be deployed around major population centers to provide area air defense in the most critical areas. In particular, it would be expected to offer improved defense against low-flying cruise missiles and drones, which are challenging targets to reliably intercept. Ultimately, the mix of capabilities and advantages that NASAMS offers may well see it go on to become a more fundamental cornerstone of Taiwan’s integrated air defense system, which faces an enormous challenge in terms of the number and variety of threats it faces.

Here’s What NORAD’s Commander Just Told Us About The Langley AFB ...	The incursions of mystery drones over Langley Air Force Base in Virginia - which we were the first to report back in March - has sparked a lot of questions about who flew them and how the U.S. military responded to them and will do so in similar instances in the future. Drone flights over sensitive military installations, warning areas, naval warships, and critical national infrastructure sites is a major issue The War Zone has raised for years. Today we had a chance to ask the general responsible for defending America's airspace about the issue and the Langley incursions, in particular. Speaking to The War Zone along with a small group of reporters at Peterson Space Force Base in Colorado Springs, the commander of U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) and the joint U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) Air Force Gen. Gregory M. Guillot offered few specifics about the incursions but talked about some of the steps NORAD is taking in the wake of those incidents. A satellite image of Langley Air Force Base. Google Earth 'The only thing I can tell you about the Langley drones is roughly the number and roughly the altitude,' he said when we asked him about the exact characteristics and configurations of those drones. He did not elaborate. However, earlier this month, Air Force Gen. Mark Kelly told The Wall Street Journal that at least one of the drones was 'roughly 20 feet long and flying at more than 100 miles an hour, at an altitude of roughly 3,000 to 4,000 feet. Other drones followed, one by one, sounding in the distance like a parade of lawn mowers.' Replying to our question, Guillot told us he did not know if they were tracked back to their recovery point or whether they could have been launched by a vessel off the coast. The Langley incursions were among more than 600 reported over U.S. military installations since 2022, NORAD stated Tuesday. In the wake of the rash of drone activity over Langley AFB, NORAD was tasked by the Joint Chiefs of Staff to look at drone incursions across the U.S., Guillot said. 'I saw that NORAD’s responsibility for countering UAS was very limited to something that would be an attack of national consequence,' he explained not the small drones as seen over Langley and elsewhere. NORTHCOM, meanwhile, has no responsibility or authority to take action, because the services are charged with securing their facilities. As part of his assessment, Guillot examined the defensive capabilities Langley had at the time, what was brought in, 'and then how could they operate in that system.' That led to the creation of a counter-drone experiment this week called Falcon Peak 2025, in which several companies will offer their solutions to counter these incursions. We will go into more detail on these possible solutions after we see some of the systems in use on Wednesday. After taking the reins at both commands in February, Guillot initiated a 90-day assessment of what role they could play in dealing with the kind of small drones that flew over Langley, That situation formed the centerpiece of his assessment, he testified before Congress in March. Air Force Gen. Gregory M. Guillot, commander, U.S. Northern Command and North American Aerospace Defense Command, testifies during the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on the Review of the Defense Authorization Request for Fiscal Year 2025 and the Future Years Defense Program. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) Tom Williams One finding he talked about Tuesday was that NORAD should coordinate the military and government’s response to small drone incursions. 'I want to make sure that we have a solid foundation for the DOD and the interagency, and I also want to put an umbrella over the top where someone's looking out to share best practices and ensure machine-to-machine linkage, so we can share that type of information,' Guillot remarked. In addition, he wants to 'work with industry to make sure that we're building the right kind of systems that we need to defeat the threats that we're seeing, not only now, but expect to see into the future.' Guillot said that he 'coordinates frequently' with the recently formed All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), the Pentagon’s unit tracking what used to be known as UFOs. In addition, he remains confident that the incursions reported over installations are small drones as opposed to something that can't be identified. As we have frequently reported, there have been unidentified drone incursions for years over U.S. military installations, warning areas, and critical government facilities. Among them were a very similar repeated rashes of claimed drone sightings in Colorado in 2020 in an area where many of America’s ICBMs are based. Another took place at the Palo Verde nuclear facility in Arizona in 2019. Also in 2019, drones swarmed over a U.S. Navy exercise taking place 100 miles off the coast of California, raising concerns that an adversary was trying to suck up critical intelligence, including very sensitive electronic and signals emissions of America's most advanced air defense and command and control systems. The Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Paul Hamilton had a series of encounters with unidentified drones off the coast of southern California in 2019. USN More recently, we were the first to write about drone flights over the highly-secure Plant 42 in Palmdale California that were so concerning a temporary flight restriction was issued for the airspace over the facility. Asked about why the military is taking this matter more seriously now, Guillot suggested the reason is technology-based. 'We have more systems that can detect and track them with fidelity that shows the range and altitude that they are near either critical infrastructure or a base.' Guillot did acknowledge systems have been in place to detect and track objects for years and that there were lessons learned from the Chinese surveillance balloon that passed over parts of the United States and Canada in February 2023 before being shot down 'For years, we've had clutter reduction capabilities, moving target indicators that can find something moving in clutter that's very important to us,' he told another reporter at the roundtable. 'And I think, as we saw with the balloon, what the clutter gate is, you know, so you could reduce anything below a certain speed, where we have that set, and then, the elevation, how high we look, is certainly something that I think we've learned over the last several years.' You can read more about NORAD's admission that its radars were not properly configured to spot and track non-traditional aircraft following the Chinese balloon incident here and here. While he expressed confidence in the ability to detect and track larger drones and crewed aircraft, Guillot said there is a need to improve those capabilities for smaller ones. '&#8230;the purpose of this demonstration is to improve our ability to detect and track the Group One and Group Twos, which are much smaller, fly lower, which puts them in that clutter range&#8230; ' We also asked about whether the U.S. is still considering installing surface-to-air missile defense systems around military installations and critical locales (beyond Washington D.C.) and whether the umbrella provided almost entirely by a relatively small cadre on-alert fighter aircraft is still the best way to protect American skies. The 142nd Fighter Wing is one of the world’s premier air F-15 Eagle units. USAF An F-15C from the 142nd Fighter Wing. USAF The military has to take a 'layered approach' because the 'threat is layered,' Guillot enunciated. 'I think there's certainly a role for fighters. There's a role for non-kinetic or low-collateral kinetic capabilities that would be at the smaller end. And then I'm a big proponent for advances in directed energy, laser and high power microwave. So those non-kinetic capabilities that bring a kinetic result of bringing down the systems, and I think it has to be layered in today's today's threat.' 'The challenge that we see today is that it's not a single competitor or adversary that threatens us,' Guillot added. 'It's not a single domain that threatens us, and it's not a single avenue approach. So the only way to get after multiple potential adversaries or competitors in all domains from all avenues of approach is to have a layered system that includes all of the things that you talked about.' Despite all the evidence that we have brought up over the years that points to foreign actors using drones to collect intelligence about U.S. military tactics, techniques, and procedures, Guillot insisted he does not know of any 'organized or unorganized foreign nexus.' He answered 'no,' when we asked him if he is seeing patterns and joint activity around military installations and in warning areas that point to a systemic and ongoing operation by an adversary. '&#8230;but that is something that we look very closely at,' he declared. 'I haven't seen it yet, but I think one of the responsibilities of this job is to always look for or assume the worst, the biggest, the most likely course of action and the most dangerous course of action. So I'm always looking for any sort of foreign nexus. But I have not seen [and] I do not know of any organized or unorganized foreign nexus.' Underscoring the myriad aerial threats his command must handle, Guillot cut the interview short and literally ran out of the room to deal with an immediate situation. The reason, we later learned, was a civilian aircraft violated temporary flight restrictions imposed over Baltimore for the visit of VIP, NORAD spokesman John Cornelio told The War Zone. It turns out the VIP was President Joe Biden. Given the damage that small weaponized drones can do and their extremely rapid proliferation, as we have seen in Ukraine, the Middle East, and even near our own borders from cartels, combatting these threats will take up an increasing amount of resources and investment. Case in point, the Air Force is now seeking extra protection for its aircraft on the ground from such attacks using shelters and other physical countermeasures, and especially at Langley AFB.

North Korea Gaining Modern Combat Experience Fighting Ukraine Is ...	Ever since the possibility of North Korea assisting Russia in its war effort emerged in the Summer of 2022, quantifying exactly what that would look like and its downstream effects have been challenging. Now, as indications point to North Korean troops wading into the direct fighting, one aspect of this major geopolitical shift beyond how it impacts Ukraine couldn't be more clear — North Korea getting real-world combat experience on a modern battlefield alongside a well-versed ally is a very unwelcome development for South Korea and the United States. The experience aspect of North Korea's involvement in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is one we have stressed repeatedly, but it's often overlooked, with the focus being more on the immediate impact an influx of troops could have for the Kremlin's cause. This is understandable as Russia has experienced heavy losses and Ukraine has as well. Any major infusion of able bodies into the fighting from an external source could erode either side's ability to compete on the battlefield. Kim inspects a group of soldiers during training. (NK State Media) KCNA Amongst notorious resource scarcity, one thing North Korea has plenty of is troops and laborers. While it is now widely understood that over 10,000 North Korean troops are preparing to fight on behalf of Russia - including some from North Korea's brutal special operations units - that could just be the start. With one of the largest standing armies on the planet and the need for cash, energy, and technological know-how for weapons development, North Korea has excess supply to offer when it comes to exporting fighting men in exchange for what it needs and wants. Add security guarantees from the world's largest nuclear power and technological assistance in advanced weapons manufacturing and it's clear that Kim Jong Un has every reason to provide Russia with whatever manpower it thinks it needs to turn the tide on the battlefield. But the fact that under such an arrangement North Korea also gets real-world combat experience is an offering Russia could not provide the Hermit Kingdom during a time of relative peace. North Korea's isolated forces could use this experience badly. North Korean special operations forces march during a parade. (PHOTO BY ED JONES / AFP via Getty Images) The last time North Korea fought substantially in an all-out modern war was nearly 75 years ago, although since then it has taken part in more limited conflicts around the globe sporadically in varying, often shadowy capacities. In addition, international training, and especially participation in advanced war games, has been extremely limited for North Korean military units, and the fidelity of the country's organic training efforts pales in comparison to those of South Korea. The massive and as 'realistic-as-possible' combat exercises South Korea executes alongside its American partners are far more advanced and actually combat representative than anything North Korea is capable of emulating. This is on top of the relatively poor standards of combat training for North Korean regular forces as a whole. So, being able to train with Russian forces and then fight in a real war with the threat of things like standoff guided weaponry, kamikaze drones, electronic warfare, night vision and thermal optics, and so much more, against a very battle-hardened enemy ground force, is arguably a priceless opportunity. The fact that the Ukrainian battlefield has direct similarities with what would exist during a war on the Peninsula is an even bigger plus.

(Photo by Jung Yeon-je / AFP) JUNG YEON-JE And yes, this means many North Koreans will die, and quite rapidly one would think, especially if Russia uses them as they have some of their conscripts and contracted forces in archaic 'meat assaults,' but in some ways that's the point. While paid for in blood, the learning curve will be very steep and likely well-documented. As brutal as it may be, lessons come quickly when they emanate from massive losses of lives on the battlefield. What North Korea learns firsthand the hard way, and from their Russian counterparts who have years of combat experience, can be incorporated into doctrine, training, and especially its weapons development endeavors, which Russia is likely assisting with, at least in some ways. Once again, sacrificing large numbers of your countrymen to get a clear view of the realities of modern combat is a very dark endeavor, but it is what it is in this case. PHOTO BY VLADIMIR SMIRNOV/POOL/AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES It remains to be seen how effective North Korean soldiers will even be and large hurdles such as language, foundational training, and equipment needs clearly exist when it comes to incorporating Pyongyang's forces into Russia's war machine. How exactly these will be overcome, especially in the near term, is unclear. It may turn out that North Korean troops are more trouble than they are worth and consume already scarce materiel and logistical support without the gains needed to justify the investment. There is also the real possibility of mass defections. But this doesn't change the benefit the North Korean army will get from combat operations regardless. Just how deep North Korea's involvement will end up being is also a huge question mark. If it is limited to what we think it is today — providing some weapons like ballistic missiles, millions of artillery shells, and around 10,000 troops — then its impact won't shift the realities of the battlefield that are already established. There are indications that, beyond small groups possibly already deployed to Ukraine, this initial cadre will be used to help boot Ukraine out of Russia's Kursk region, thus their deployment will be limited to Russia's own soil. If these troops end up being in any way effective and North Korea injects far greater numbers into the fight, not just to fight in Kursk but in Ukraine itself, it could be a massive problem for Kyiv which is struggling with holding ground as it is. Maybe just as concerning is that the impact of North Korea sending tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine would stem far beyond the reaches of Eastern Europe. North Korean troops raid a beach during training. (NK State Media) North Korea becoming a direct fighting player in this war greatly internationalizes the conflict. South Korea is already mulling jumping in with advisors and providing weaponry, the latter of which it has a large inventory of and the ability to quickly deliver more. Escalation could also come from Ukraine's allies who may see the arrival of a foreign regular fighting force in Ukraine as a reason to escalate by sending its own troops or expanding other forms of support or lifting restrictions on where and how advanced weapons can be used. But above all else, no matter how badly its troops do in combat, North Korea will walk away from this conflict with a new understanding of the demands of modern warfare from a battlefield that has similarities to the one that could erupt on the Korean Peninsula. It will exploit these lessons to the max. This, along with Russia's cash, energy, and weapons development resources, as well as intelligence, will result in a more robust, ready, and deadlier North Korean military.

Our Best Look At Taiwan’s New Drone Submarine	New imagery of Taiwan’s homegrown Huilong uncrewed underwater vehicle (UUV) — also known as the Smart Dragon — reveals more details of this intriguing craft, including what appears to be a pair of torpedo tubes, pointing to an expanded kinetic potential for the type. At this stage, it seems this relatively large drone submarine is intended as a testbed, rather than for an operational role, but its development does point to the growing ambitions of the Taiwanese Navy in terms of underwater warfare and the design, and certainly elements of it, could end up in a production form. In recent days, imagery has appeared showing the Huilong both out of the water and undergoing at-sea trials. Photos of the Huilong in a dry dock, still surrounded by scaffolding, provide a good view of the front end of the UUV, with the characteristic twin torpedo tubes at the front. Ahead of the apertures are yellow-painted cradles of the kind used to maneuver and load torpedoes and possibly torpedo-sized UUVs. A look at the rear end of the vessel, meanwhile, reveals an X-shaped rudder and tail fin arrangement, as well as a 5-bladed bladed propeller with raked tips.

Estimated specifications for the UUV include a length of around 30 meters (98 feet), a width of height of around 3.6 meters (11.8 feet), and a height of around 6 meters (19.7 feet) including the conning tower. The Huilong is thought to have a displacement of approximately 100 tons. The Huilong’s test role was reiterated in recent statements by the Taiwanese minister of defense. They said that the UUV is primarily meant for trials of sonar and underwater mines and apparently said that it doesn’t have its own propulsion system. Instead, during sea trials, it will be towed by a support vessel, the minister said. Bearing in mind the configuration of the Huilong, including propeller and tailplanes, the craft should at least have the potential to manuever under its own power, although this might only happen after initial towed trials and even then, towing it in and out of port will probably be necessary. While there has been some speculation that the Huilong might also have an operational role, there’s so far no confirmation of this. Taiwan's 'Smart Dragon' UUV is equipped with 2 torpedoes tubes. pic.twitter.com/vmeMJPjpV8&mdash; Taiwan Military (@TaiwanMilitary) October 23, 2024 More likely, it seems that technologies will be proven using the Huilong and will be ported over to follow-on UUVs, which cold include a production version of the test submarine. There are unconfirmed reports that the Huilong is intended to lead to a UUV that can be deployed from the backs of crewed submarines, although if this is possible due to its size is unclear. The design would seem to suggest it would be suitable for operating out of ports, as well. Other reports suggest that the Huilong is designed to deploy smaller UUVs, suggesting that there are ultimately plans for drone submarines that can potentially launch both torpedoes as well as UUVs that could be used for surveillance, target acquisition, and perhaps also strike operations. Laying mines is also a likely mission set. There are even conflicting accounts of whether the Huilong is a true UUV, or whether there is also provision made to carry some crew, with some reports suggesting the UUV has space for two to four people. Perhaps, a crew will be embarked in a test capacity, before moving to fully uncrewed operations. While many questions about the Huilong remain unanswered, there’s meanwhile no doubt that Taiwan is investing in its underwater capabilities. Earlier this year, TWZ reported about Taiwan’s first domestically made submarine, the Hai Kun, which entered the water for the first time in February, after being launched in September 2023. Taiwan’s first domestically made submarine, the Hai Kun (SS-711). CSBC Corporation The diesel-electric boat is the first of eight planned to provide a much-needed upgrade for Taiwan’s antiquated submarine force. While an initial assessment of the Hai Kun suggests an unusual combination of some fairly advanced features, it also potentially has a quality of finish that leaves something to be desired. The fact that Taiwan has, for many years, struggled to acquire foreign-made submarines spurred the development of the Hai Kun. But as the submarine fleet of the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) rapidly grows, the potential of UUVs to at least help address the imbalance is likely to make them an attractive option for Taiwan. In the past, Taiwanese officials have boldly stated that its new crewed submarines will be a 'strategic deterrent,' that could maintain a 'lifeline' to the Pacific in times of crisis, such as a Chinese naval blockade. That ambition seems less realistic when we take into account the fact that the PLAN submarine fleet numbers at least 60 boats, of all types, with the production of different designs and the development of new ones continuing at a rapid pace. The modern Type 039C, with its distinctive sail that is very likely intended to improve the boat’s stealthy characteristics, typifies the rapid pace of innovation in Chinese submarine design. via X While Taiwan will never be able to challenge China in terms of submarine numbers, UUVs — especially ones that can operate alongside crewed submarines — could play a very useful role. The fact is not lost on Beijing, either, with the PLAN also increasingly exploring the potential of UUVs as well as uncrewed surface vessels (USVs). Taiwan’s future submarine doctrine will be based around modern diesel-electric submarines that will likely exploit their advantages for ‘asymmetric’ warfare. This could involve setting ambushes for Chinese vessels. These same kinds of missions could potentially also be taken on by future UUVs, with torpedo-armed ones being especially suitable for ambushes. As well as launching torpedoes, the UUVs could also lay sea mines, a growing area of interest for the U.S. Navy, as well. As well as operations around Taiwan, the country’s submarine fleet could also venture further afield, including into the so-called ‘first island chain,’ where it could disrupt PLAN activities in major chokepoints like the Bashi Channel and the Miyako Strait. Again, UUVs could be of particular value here, with their small size making them proficient for shallow-water operations. A Pentagon graphic showing the geographic boundaries of the First and Second Island Chains. U.S. Department of Defense At the same time, both UUVs and crewed submarines would be prime targets for the PLAN during a conflict, in which China’s growing anti-submarine warfare capabilities would be targeting these as a matter of priority. But flooding the battespace with drones of all types is increasingly seen as a potential decisive factor in a battle across the Taiwan Strait. UUVs are definitely going to be an increasingly critical part of this tactical equation. Operational Taiwanese UUVs may still be some way off, but there’s no doubt that the country needs to urgently modernize and expand its submarine fleet. As you can read about here, this currently consists of two Hai Lung class boats, built in the Netherlands in the mid-1980s but subject to a mid-life upgrade that began in 2016. There are also two veteran Hai Shih class boats, which were originally built as Tench class and Balao class submarines during World War II, but these are understood to no longer go to sea. Faced with the threat of China’s fast-growing underwater armada, Taiwan’s interest in UUVs is understandable and it will be interesting to follow their development as it continues to upgrade its submarine force.

Ukraine Strikes Chechnya With Long-Range Drones For The First Tim...	The Kremlin-appointed Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov has vowed to avenge a Ukrainian drone attack that struck a military training facility in Chechnya. The raid, which appears to be the first of its kind to hit the southern Russian republic, is one of the longest-range drone strikes that Ukraine has attempted. The target was a special forces training center, but the attack also carries significant symbolic value, due to the high level of support of local strongman Ramzan Kadyrov for Russia’s war in Ukraine. Imagery posted to social media shows the apparent aftermath of the drone strike, on the military training academy in the town of Gudermes, 22 miles east of Grozny, the Chechen capital. As we have discussed in the past, Kadyrov was directly responsible for the creation of the Russian University of Special Forces — also known as the University of Spetsnaz — in Gudermes in 2013. Unprecedented: this morning around 6:30 am local time, the so-called 'Russian Special Forces University named after Vladimir Putin' in Gudermes, Chechnya, was attacked by unidentified drones, as reported by Ramzan Kadyrov.

'They’ve bitten us — we will destroy them,' Kadyrov told reporters in a video published by Russian state news agency RIA. 'In the very near future we’ll show them the kind of vengeance they’ve never even dreamt of,' he added. A satellite image of the Russian University of Special Forces in Gudermes. Imagery from today shows the large, boomerang-shaped building close to the center of the facility on fire. Google Earth As is typical for drone strikes of this kind, there was no immediate comment from officials in Kyiv. The privately run training academy’s glitzy website describes it as a 'professional educational institution,' that offers 'unique training grounds, methodology, and teaching staff that have no analogs in Russia.' The website features prominent testimonies from both Kadyrov and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The academy instructs both soldiers and civilians in a variety of combat tactics, including gunnery, drone operating, battlefield first aid, and parachute landing.

Russian University of Special Forces More than 47,000 troops deployed to the front line in Ukraine have been trained in Gudermes, according to the Kremlin. Meanwhile, a report from the Russian state news agency TASS claims that over 19,000 volunteers have been trained at the university before going to fight in Ukraine. Ukraine has been regularly using long-range drones of various types to strike targets in Russia, including hitting targets many hundreds of miles behind the front lines. Gudermes is around 780 miles from Odesa and around 650 miles from Kharkiv. As far as we know, this is the first time a Ukrainian drone strike has been launched against Chechnya, which is led by Kadyrov, a close ally of Putin who has frequently played on his warlord credentials to help bolster support for the war in Ukraine. Last month, Kadyrov garnered press coverage due to his claim that Tesla CEO Elon Musk had 'remotely disabled' his machine-gun-armed Cybertruck, which he had sent to the front line in Ukraine, where he said it had been 'performing well in combat.' 'What Elon Musk did was not nice. He gives expensive gifts from the heart and then remotely switches them off,' Kadyrov said, before noting that another pair of Cybertrucks had since been sent to the Ukrainian battlefield. More significantly, Kadyrov has contributed thousands of his own Chechen paramilitary forces to support the full-scale Russian invasion, since the very beginning of the operation. | At the special order of Ramazan Kadyrov, about 10,000 #Chechen National Guard departs to support the #Russia|n invasion of #Ukraine. - Local resources -pic.twitter.com/rUtUNmJ9hq&mdash; EHA News (@eha_news) February 25, 2022 Chechen servicemen from a Rosgvardia spetsnaz unit in Hostomel raising the Russia flag over a Ukrainian national guard base. pic.twitter.com/ceQjZ2Tgia&mdash; Rob Lee (@RALee85) February 26, 2022 Reportedly video of Chechen fighters headed to Ukraine on a transport aircraft. pic.twitter.com/rHUChT2ZeT&mdash; Rob Lee (@RALee85) March 13, 2022 While Kadyrov presents an image of staunch loyalty to Moscow, his position has also seen him emerge as one of the few political figures in Russia who speaks out about the way the war in Ukraine is being fought. Kadyrov has not held back from criticizing the Russian Armed Forces leadership when Ukrainian forces have made advances or offered tougher-than-expected resistance and he has suggested in the past that Putin might not be fully aware of the real situation on the ground in Ukraine. Earlier this year there were signs that the Kremlin might be looking to appoint a new Chechen leader, amid rumors that Kadyrov was seriously ill with pancreatic necrosis. The leader responded by publishing a workout video to counter claims of his deteriorating health. 'Remember that taking care of your health is an investment in your future,' a caption to the video read, while footage showed Kadyrov bench-pressing, lifting weights, and wrestling with a sparring partner. Interestingly, Kadyrov also moved to shore up his position as a staunch Putin supporter after the death of Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner mercenary group who launched a brief armed mutiny against Russia’s leadership in the summer of 2023, before being killed in a plane crash, the details of which remain murky. A day after Prigozhin’s funeral, Kadyrov — who had previously suggested that he could provide an alternative to the Wagner boss — described himself as Putin’s foot soldier and said he was ready to die for the Russian president. There were also suggestions Kadyrov might be lining himself up as Prigozhin’s successor, with his claims that former Wagner Group mercenaries were training in Chechnya with his forces. Russian President Vladimir Putin and the head of the Chechen Republic Ramzan Kadyrov visit the Russian University of Special Forces in Gudermes on August 20 of this year. Photo by Vyacheslav PROKOFYEV / POOL / AFP VYACHESLAV PROKOFYEV With repeated accusations of human rights violations, including torture and extrajudicial killings, as well as sanctions in multiple countries to his name, Kadyrov remains a very visible and highly active supporter of the Russian war effort. The fact the territory he rules over has come under long-range drone attack shouldn’t be too much of a surprise as Ukraine continues to expand its drone programs. There is a possibility that Russia’s failure to defend Kadyrov’s republic against drone attacks will lead to more criticisms leveled toward the Russian Ministry of Defense. Ever since Ukraine began its campaign of long-range drone strikes, there have been questions asked about the efficiency and preparedness of Russian air defenses to counter these threats. At the same time, depending on the damage that was inflicted, targeting the Russian University of Special Forces may also serve to disrupt the operations at what is, by all accounts, an important training center feeding both Russian soldiers and volunteers to support the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine. But above all else, this was a symbolic strike, although it could be the first of many more to come.

Next-Gen M1 Abrams Tank’s Active Protection System, Autoloader De...	The U.S. Army pushed back the start of work on a new integrated active protection system (APS) and autoloader for its planned next-generation iteration of the M1 Abrams tank, or M1E3, into the current fiscal year. The service announced last year that it had axed plans for another incremental upgrade for the M1 in favor of a major rework of the design focused heavily on new advanced capabilities, reduced weight, and increased fuel economy. The disclosure of 'the decision to delay the start until FY 2025 of the Integrated Main Battle Tank System effort which is specifically focused on the maturation of the autoloader and the active protection system' was included in a Pentagon budget document detailing various so-called reprogramming actions. The U.S. military has to, by law, seek approval from Congress to reallocate funds from one part of its budget to another. The Pentagon document, which is dated September 11, does not say exactly when the Integrated Main Battle Tank System work is expected to start, if it hasn't already. Fiscal Year 2025 began on October 1. A US Army M1 Abrams tank fires its main gun during training. US Army 'This decision maps with the schedule for the related program of record,' the reprogramming document says, as well as that the action helped free up $1.451 million for other priorities. General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS), the current prime contractor for the Abrams, received a preliminary M1E3 design contract last year. An APS that is not just an add-on system, but deeply integrated into the design, as well as an autoloader, are currently key planned elements of the future M1E3. 'That’s going to be substantially better than what we had with the installed Trophy system, which gives us great capabilities, but it’s not integrated,' Army Brig. Gen. Geoffrey Norman, head of the service's Next-Generation Combat Vehicle Cross Functional Team, told an audience at a Maneuver Warfighter Conference in September 2023, according to Breaking Defense. The Army has been integrating the Israeli-designed Trophy onto a portion of its existing Abrams tanks since 2017. Trophy is a hard-kill APS designed primarily to protect against anti-tank guided missiles, as well as other types of infantry anti-armor weapons, such as shoulder-fired rockets and rocket-propelled grenades. The system uses an array of small radars positioned around the vehicle it is installed on to detect threats and cue pre-loaded launchers. The launchers use a small explosive charge to expel a burst of kinetic projectiles to defeat or at least disrupt targets through force of impact. Trophy's manufacturer Rafael just recently unveiled a new version of the system that adds additional capabilities against top-down threats, including drones. An APS that is better optimized specifically for M1E3 and more streamlined into the design overall could have benefits both for the tank's physical structure and when it comes to auxiliary power and weight requirements. Add-on APSs like Trophy are often characterized by the addition of bulky and heavy protrusions around a vehicle, as well as sometimes onerous additional power demands. These issues have stymied Army attempts to add APSs to its Stryker light armored vehicles in recent years. Hard-kill APSs are only expected to become more important for tanks and heavy armored vehicles going forward. The new version of Trophy also underscores how these systems could help provide a critical additional layer of defense against growing threats posed by uncrewed aerial systems, something The War Zone previously explored in an in-depth feature. A US Army Abrams tank equipped with the Trophy APS. US Army via Leonardo An M1 Abrams tank with the Trophy APS installed. U.S. Army via Leonardo An autoloader for the main gun, a feature the U.S. military has historically eschewed on main battle tanks, is also set to be a key element of the M1E3's design. 'Are we looking at autoloaders for the tank to potentially reduce the crew size or allow for members to do different tasks? The short answer is absolutely, yes,' Brig. Gen. Geoffrey Norman said at the Maneuver Warfighter Conference last year. 'What that solution looks like, is one of those series of experiments that’s ongoing right now.' The autoloader will allow the tank to be operated by just three individuals, rather than the four currently required to crew existing Abrams variants. An auto-loading main gun and reduced crew also offer an avenue to make substantial changes to the tank's internal and external physical architecture, especially when it comes to the turret, which could help lower its profile and trim weight. It is worth noting here that autoloaders have been developed for the Abrams in the past, but have not been integrated onto any fielded variants of the tank to date. Whether the M1E3 might also come along with a new larger caliber or otherwise advanced main gun in place of the 120mm type found on Abrams today remains to be seen. 2/5 The magazine is double-row, closed-loop carousel of canisters that are cycled to place the requested round into a feed position, meaning you don't need the current big blast doors, instead just a small port (which is how most autoloaders with protected carousels work). pic.twitter.com/gEI9qVNG8P&mdash; Jon Hawkes (@JonHawkes275) October 22, 2024 4/5 The loading mechanism's 'operational swept volume does not encroach into any useable space within the turret', allowing you to keep all 4 crew (loader would do something else now). A few concept tanks have played with that 4th person becoming a systems operator for UAS/LM etc&mdash; Jon Hawkes (@JonHawkes275) October 22, 2024 Significantly reduced weight and a more economical hybrid propulsion system in lieu of the Abrams' existing fuel-hungry gas turbine powerplant are also expected to be key features of the final M1E3 design. Brig. Gen. Norman told Defense News that the goal weight-wise was to get the next-generation tank down to around 60 tons. With a full combat load, the latest M1A2 SEPv3 version tips the scale at around 78 tons. 'That might be a little aggressive, but we’re pretty ambitious,' Norman said. 'In order to do that, we anticipate having to change the crew configuration, potentially looking at opportunities to go to a remote turret or an optionally manned turret in order to save the space under armor.' GDLS has already presented one vision for what a future lighter-weight, hybrid-powered, autoloader-equipped, and otherwise redesigned Abrams might look like with its AbramsX demonstrator, which it rolled out in 2022. More broadly, the M1E3 effort, and lead-in work on APSs, autoloaders, and other systems, comes at a time when the Army is looking at a future where tanks, in general, might have a very different and de-emphasized role on the battlefield. While the ongoing war in Ukraine has underscored the continued relevance of heavy armored vehicles, the Army also expects the growing anti-armor threat ecosystem to present ever-more substantial challenges going forward, especially in any future high-end conflict.

Army Science Board A slide from a briefing accompanying the Army Science Board's report that gives a general overview of existing and emerging threats the M1 Abrams is facing. Army Science Board 'Based on our findings, The M1 Abrams will not dominate the 2040 battlefield. All of the M1’s advantages in mobility, firepower, and protection are at risk,' an Army Science Board study published last year declares. 'The M1A2 SEP V3&4 upgrades will improve effectiveness but will not restore dominance. Near transparency in all domains will significantly increase the lethality our forces will experience. China and Russia have studied our forces and doctrine and are fielding countermeasures.' You can read more about that study and its findings here. With all this in mind, risk reduction work on key systems like APSs and autoloaders, which the Army is now scheduled to start this fiscal year, will be important as the service presses ahead in firming up its requirements for its next-generation Abrams tanks.

New Chinese Mystery Flattop Emerges	An example of an entirely new class of Chinese vessel with a large open flight deck has emerged at a shipyard in the southeastern end of the country. From what can be seen in satellite imagery, the ship has features in line with a light aircraft carrier or a big-deck amphibious assault ship, but there are some indications that it might be a first-of-its-kind ostensibly civilian ocean research vessel. China does have a long history of developing and fielding new maritime scientific research capabilities with clear potential military applicability. A satellite image of Guangzhou Shipyard International taken on October 23, 2024, showing, among other things, what looks to be a new class of Chinese ship with a large flight deck. PHOTO © 2024 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Tom Shugart, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) think tank, was among the first to spot the new ship under construction at Guangzhou Shipyard International (GSI) on Longxue Island just southeast of the city of Guangzhou. Shugart's attention had been drawn to the yard first by the appearance there of what looks to be a new high-speed trimaran uncrewed surface vessel (USV) that has reportedly been under construction in Guangzhou since at least 2022. An earlier Chinese trimaran USV design, which evoked the design of the U.S. Navy’s highly successful Sea Hunter, had previously emerged back in 2020. So it just jumped out to me that next to the possible new Chinese USV is what looks like might be&#8230;possibly a new aircraft carrier or amphibious assault ship of some sort? Appears to be about 200m long, with a beam of about 40m, and two islands on one side of the deck. pic.twitter.com/oHhMWYWQFZ&mdash; Tom Shugart (@tshugart3) October 28, 2024 From what can be seen in satellite imagery The War Zone has obtained from Planet Labs, the new large deck ship is around 656 feet (200 meters) long and some 131 feet (40 meters) at its widest. It looks to have a larger main island on the right side of the center of the deck, as well as a smaller one further toward the bow. In speaking with The War Zone, Shugart said there are also what might be exhaust stacks on the right side of the deck toward the stern. He further highlighted what looks to be an angular mast structure on top of the main island of a kind often seen in warships as a mount for radars and other sensors. Overall, the ship's size and what can be seen of its configuration are in line, at least in broad strokes, with many existing light aircraft carriers and big deck amphibious assault ships, such as Japan's Hyuga class and China's own Type 075. The new big deck ship at GSI also looks to have been built very quickly. There is no clear sign of it in high-resolution satellite imagery of GSI's yard from May, but it is visible in a drydock there in August and looks to have been launched sometime between September 10 and October 9. A satellite image taken on October 23, seen earlier in this story, shows further progress, including what appears to be work to finish the surface of the flight deck. A satellite image taken on September 10, 2024, showing the new big deck ship still in dry dock at GSI's yard. The trimaran USV being built there is also visible at bottom right. PHOTO © 2024 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION The carrier-esque ship's appearance at GSI's yard is curious in itself. The shipbuilder is best known, at least publicly, for constructing larger commercial vessels, such as oil tankers, ore carriers, roll-on/roll-off cargo ships, and semi-submersible heavy lift types. Floating cranes and dry docks, and even marine wind turbines, are seen in past imagery. At the same time, GSI's work does have a clear military dimension. Previous satellite images show numerous Soviet-designed Zubr class heavy hovercraft, which China has built examples of domestically under license. Also visible are what CNAS' Shugart says look to be large naval auxiliary type ships for the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), along with the new trimaran USV. Visible in the satellite image of the GSI yard taken on August 8 are a pair of Zubr class hovercraft (toward top right), a floating dry dock (toward the center), a floating crane (at bottom right), as well as the new big deck ship under construction dry dock (toward upper left) and and the apparent trimaran USV (at center). Also just visible at bottom right is one blade belonging to a maritime wind turbine. PHOTO © 2024 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION 'I was really surprised to see it,' Shugart told The War Zone about spotting the new big-deck ship in Guangzhou. 'It all depends on&#8230; what's kind of the bigger plan for the PLA Navy,' Shugart added when asked about what this might mean for GSI's portfolio going forward. 'Are they [the PLAN] continuing to grow? Are they growing at a rate that they need to start using some other shipyards?' It is certainly no secret that the PLAN's fleets have been growing substantially in recent years and continue to do so on the back of the country's substantial shipbuilding capacity, as The War Zone has explored in detail before. Work to expand the size and scope of the PLAN's battle force includes the production of new aircraft carriers, large amphibious assault ships, advanced submarines, and more modern surface combatants. Fujian, China's first catapult-assisted takeoff but arrested recovery (CATOBAR) configured carrier, and the first example of a new uniquely large big-deck amphibious ship that also features a catapult, commonly known as the Type 076, are prime important of the new naval capabilities the country has on the immediate horizon.

Fujian out finally Smoke is visible, lets see If itd for Trials this time pic.twitter.com/R6VFqEgeFl&mdash; Húrin (@Hurin92) April 29, 2024 A new class of light aircraft carrier, amphibious assault ship, or even a sea base-type vessel could offer the PLAN valuable additional operational capacity. A simpler design built more to commercial standards, and with an air component centered on crewed helicopters and drones, could also make a lot of sense for supporting certain missions. This might include presence operations, particularly in and around the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. Such a ship could be useful for supporting anti-submarine warfare and amphibious operations, too. Just being able to build these ships at an additional shipyard could help the PLAN further accelerate its expansion of naval aviation and other capabilities. At the same time, there may also be another uniquely Chinese explanation behind the appearance of the new vessel with its large flight deck in Guangzhou. Since at least 2022, a screenshot said to be from a Chinese government tender has been floating around the internet. A machine translation of its Chinese-language text shows a call for a 'large-scale special deck operation' ship for maritime survey and other test/research activities with some kind of flight deck featuring a 'double-island superstructure.' There is also a demand for a 'through-type straight deck' and a 'dock compartment' at the stern, which could refer to a floodable well deck like those found on many amphibious warfare ships. Stated requirements include that the vessel be 200 meters long, have a flight deck 25 meters wide, have a displacement of 15,000 tons, be capable of hitting a top speed of at least 16 knots, have a range of 5,000 nautical miles at a cruising speed of 12 knots, and a maximum at-sea endurance of 40 days. The provenance of this apparent tender is unclear and, at the time of writing, neither CNAS' Shugart nor The War Zone has been able to readily verify its source independently. Still, some Chinese netizens have taken this in the past to be evidence of potential plans for an ostensibly civilian oceanographic research 'carrier.' China's New Toy-Scientific Research Aircraft Carrier pic.twitter.com/wetiUq8VMS&mdash; 彩云香江 (@louischeung_hk) September 14, 2022 As already noted, the lines between civilian and military assets in China, especially when it comes to the maritime domain, are often at best blurry. The War Zone has highlighted this reality on multiple occasions in the past specifically with regard to ships and other capabilities ostensibly tasked with underwater survey, oceanographic research, and other ostensibly scientific missions. A non-military vessel configured like an amphibious assault ship – something no country in the world currently operates – would be able to employ aerial drones and crewed helicopters, and watercraft (crewed and uncrewed) to conduct scientific or other civilian missions. At the same time, it would inherently be capable of serving as a dual-use platform to support military missions like those previously described if called upon. Another possibility could be that whatever is being built in Guangzhou is some kind of bespoke military training and/or test platform. The Chinese already have a number of unusual naval platforms, including ones capable of launching and recovering vertical take-off and landing capable drones, primarily designed to fulfill such roles. Earlier this year, Naval News reported on the appearance of what looks be another such ship at the Jiangsu Dayang Marine shipyard near Shanghai. The vessel in question, which is around 328 feet (100 meters) long and has an open flight deck on top, was spotted alongside two catamaran drone mini-carriers that The War Zone was the first to report on in detail. Correction: the earlier drone carrier was more like 100m in length - still much smaller.&mdash; Tom Shugart (@tshugart3) October 28, 2024 CNAS's Shugart told The War Zone that the big deck vessel under construction at GSI looked too large, in his opinion, to have a similar test and/or training role. Given the speed with which the large deck ship looks to be being constructed in Guangzhou, it may not be long before a fuller picture of its configuration and intended purpose now emerges.

Israeli Strikes Knocked Out All Of Iran’s S-300 Air Defense Syste...	Iran is likely still tallying the costs of the Israeli airstrikes launched on Saturday in retaliation for Tehran’s massive October 1 missile barrage on Israel. Among the targets that Israel appears to have gone after are Iran’s prized Russian-made S-300 air defense systems, according to U.S. and Israeli officials. Putting the Iranian S-300s out of action leaves the door open to follow-up strikes by Israel, including larger-scale direct attacks. As we noted on Saturday, this serves as both a contingent opportunity for the Israel Defense Forces and a deterrent against a response from Iran. Among the critical Iranian military infrastructure destroyed on Saturday were its three surviving S-300 long-range surface-to-air missile systems. This is the assessment of unnamed U.S. and Israeli officials speaking to the Wall Street Journal. Iran’s only other S-300 system was already hit by Israel earlier this year.

Photo by ATTA KENARE / AFP ATTA KENARE The same officials disclosed that Iran managed to bring down 'few if any' of the missiles that Israel launched from around 100 jet fighters, during Saturday’s raid, codenamed Operation Days of Repentance. The officials’ statements tally with assessments from the U.S. think tank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), including descriptions of Israel inflicting 'serious damage to the Iranian integrated air defense network.' 'The IDF struck three or four S-300 sites, including one at the Imam Khomeini International Airport near Tehran,' the ISW adds. The think tank states that at least some of the air defense sites targeted were protecting critical energy infrastructure in western and southwestern Iran and identifies sites being hit at the Abadan oil refinery, the Bandar Imam Khomeini energy complex and port, and the Tang-eh Bijar gas field.

While the S-300 has been steadily updated since it was first introduced by the Soviet Union in the late 1970s, it is now an aging system and one that has proven vulnerable in Ukraine. Nevertheless, it remains a significant threat, especially if used as part of a layered air defense system, and these surface-to-air missile systems were the most capable of their kind available to Iran. Tehran was the recipient of one of the more modern iterations of the S-300, namely the S-300PMU-2 Favorit (known to NATO as the SA-20B Gargoyle), which was introduced in 1997 and which has improved anti-ballistic missile capabilities. It should be noted that, over the years the IAF has trained against the specific S-300 threat in several multinational air exercises, making use of S-300PMU-1 systems operated by Greece and S-300s in the U.S., and refining its tactics in the process.

Costas Metaxakis/AFP via Getty Images Replacement of Iran’s S-300s, at least in the near term, is hardly straightforward. Russia currently needs as much air defense equipment as it can produce, for the war in Ukraine, so the transfer of systems from its own stocks to Tehran seems less realistic. There’s also likely to be a long wait for new-production Russian air defense systems in the same class, like the more capable S-400. One option might be the deployment of one or two Russian batteries, as has happened before in Syria, but this would be more symbolic than anything else, and it is still less likely due to the strain on Russia’s own air defenses.

We also don't know the state of Iran's other air defense systems and networking architecture, which could have been attacked non-kinetically, especially using cyber tactics. There are unconfirmed reports from Israel that some kind of follow-up operation might already have been prepared, with claims that government targets and infrastructure could be next, although Iranian nuclear facilities will apparently be spared for now. Considering how Saturday’s airstrikes included significant softening up of Israeli air defenses, it is almost inevitable that Israel has several follow-up options already planned should Iran respond with another barrage.

The attack killed at least four soldiers. As well as targeting air defense sites, including the S-300 systems, the Israeli attack was calculated to disrupt Iranian production of missiles and drones, something that should have a knock-on effect on Tehran’s proxies, such as Hezbollah and the Houthis, as well as for Russia. One of the missile production facilities appears to be the Shahroud factory in Semnan province, with evidence of damage there seen below. Although Shahroud is best known for its role in the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) space program, it is also assessed to be an important center for the large-scale production of short- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles, too.

In particular, the Israeli airstrikes appear to have targeted parts of the facility that were used for the production of the solid fuel that powers newer Iranian ballistic missiles. ISW predicts that Iran 'will likely need months or possibly a year or more' to acquire the equipment needed to replace these losses at Parchin. Since the raids, more footage has emerged showing apparent destruction at another Iranian site, namely at Shams Abad, near Arak, which is understood to be home to a major drone production facility.

It still remains unclear if any IAF aircraft flew into Iranian airspace, but some reports claim they did. Even using only standoff munitions, this may have been necessary in order to reach targets in eastern Iran, although they may not have had to penetrate far. At the same time, these weapons provide a combination of high accuracy and significant destructive power and are a major challenge to intercept. There are still differing accounts as to the number of munitions launched by the IAF. The deputy commanding officer of the Iranian Army’s Southwestern Command, Mohammad Mokhtari-far, today claimed that more than 600 missiles were launched by Israeli aircraft. Bearing in mind multiple reports suggesting around 100 Israeli aircraft were involved, this figure seems vastly inflated. On the other hand, it remains very likely that Israel also employed other means to degrade Iranian air defenses, including potential cyber-attacks. The Deputy-Commanding Officer of the Iranian Army’s Southwestern Command, Mohammad Mokhtari-far claimed on Monday that over 600 Missiles were launched by Israeli Aircraft against Sites in Iran, during Friday Night’s Attack.&mdash; OSINTdefender (@sentdefender) October 28, 2024 In the meantime, Iraq has lodged a complaint to the United Nations over Israel’s use of its airspace to attack Iran. In a protest letter sent to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the U.N. Security Council, Iraq condemned 'the Zionist entity’s blatant violation of Iraq’s airspace and sovereignty by using Iraqi airspace to carry out an attack on the Islamic Republic of Iran on 26 October.' We now also know a little more about some of the IAF aircraft and units that were involved in the strikes. Pilots from various units are quoted in a Jerusalem Post article, which references 119 Squadron and 201 Squadron, which both fly the F-16I Sufa, a long-range strike specialist. 'It was an honor to fly through the dark desert, knowing every moment in the air was a step toward a new dawn for Israel,' said Lt. Col. 'Y.,' commander of 119 Squadron. 'It was an honor to fly through the dark desert, knowing every moment in the air was a step toward a new dawn for Israel,' Lt. Col. Y., said of the mission that marked Israel’s largest strike on Iran in decades. The Jerusalem Post (@Jerusalem_Post) October 27, 2024 From the Iranian side, threats of retaliation continue. Maj. Gen. Hossein Salami, the chief of Iran’s IRGC, warned Israel it would face 'bitter consequences' after its attack on Saturday, according to local media reports. Salami was quoted today as having said that Israel had 'failed to achieve its ominous goals,' describing the airstrikes as symbolic of 'miscalculation and helplessness.' At the same time, however, there is debate in Iran about what kind of response Tehran should formulate. Iran now has to make a call as to whether to not respond at all, or at least with a direct attack like that on October 1, or whether to prepare some kind of retaliation that is seen as proportionate to the Israeli airstrikes — which were more limited than many expected.

'We do not seek war, but we will defend the rights of our nation and country,' Pezeshkian told a cabinet meeting yesterday. 'We will give an appropriate response to the aggression of the Zionist regime,' he added. Meanwhile, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said that Tehran will 'use all available tools' to respond to Israel’s attack, although provided no more details on how it would 'deliver a definite and effective response to the Zionist regime.' Finally, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said yesterday that the attack should not be 'exaggerated or downplayed' but also did not vow immediate retaliation. Meanwhile, there are reports that Khamenei is gravely ill, and the search for a potential successor could lead to a power struggle with possible repercussions on the conflict with Israel.

To reinforce the deterrence effect, Israeli officials now appear to be ramping up their threats of potential follow-up strikes. Time will tell if that Israeli calculation pays off.

Dozens Of AH-64, UH-60, and CH-47 Helicopters Were Damaged In Sto...	A total of 44 U.S. Army helicopters suffered various degrees of damage during a burst of extreme weather at Fort Carson in Colorado earlier this year. This includes AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, Black Hawk utility and medical evacuation types, and Chinook heavy lifters. The service has sought at least $29.3 million to help repair the aircraft, which represent a significant portion of the fleet assigned to the 4th Infantry Division's 4th Combat Aviation Brigade. The details about the scale and scope of the damage to helicopters at Fort Carson's Butts Army Heliport come from a Pentagon document detailing various so-called budgetary reprogramming actions approved in Fiscal Year 2024, which ended on September 30. By law, the U.S. military has to get approval from Congress to reallocate funding from one part of its budget to another. 2/ pic.twitter.com/jLQ8y1xr9O&mdash; Lord Bebo (@MyLordBebo) August 3, 2024 Butts Army Heliport was hit by what the Pentagon reprogramming action described as a 'severe microburst weather event' on August 1. The National Weather Service defines a microburst as 'a localized column of sinking air (downdraft) within a thunderstorm and is usually less than or equal to 2.5 miles in diameter.' 'Funds are required for Army helicopter repairs that were damaged&#8230; at Fort Carson, CO,' the Pentagon reprogramming document, which is dated September 11, says. 'The damaged helicopters are as follows: six AH-64D; seven AH-64E; seven CH-47F; nine UH-60M; ten HH-60M; and five UH-60L.' UH-60 Black Hawks assigned to the 4th Combat Aviation Brigade. US Army The approved reprogramming put an additional $29.333 million into the Army's Operation and Maintenance account for repairs. Whether this reflects the total assessed damage to all 44 helicopters or if any additional funding to help repair them has come from other sources is unknown. Whether any of those helicopters have already been repaired and returned to service is also not known. The War Zone has reached out to Fort Carson for more information. A stock photo of some of 4th Combat Aviation Brigade's CH-47 Chinooks. US Army 'A variety of aircraft are damaged to include Apaches, Chinooks, and Black Hawks,' authorities at Fort Carson had said in a statement back on August 2. 'Facilities on the heliport have minor damage. Currently, there are no environmental impacts reported. There will be a thorough investigation to assess the damage.' 'This weather event had a significant impact to our fleet. I am grateful there were no injuries,' Army Col. Nicholas Ploetz, commander of the 4th Combat Aviation Brigade, also said in a statement at the time. 'Our Soldiers are resilient and will do what is necessary to recover our equipment and continue to perform our mission.' How many helicopters of all types the 4th Combat Aviation Brigade had assigned to it on August 1 is unclear. At least as of 2010, a typical Army Combat Aviation Brigade had around 48 AH-64s, 38 UH-60s, 12 HH-60s, and 12 CH-47s, according to one official document. The extreme weather at Fort Carson came at the tail end of a fiscal year, which began on October 1, 2023, that had also seen a notable uptick in other kinds of Army aviation accidents. This includes the crash of a 4th Combat Aviation Brigade AH-64 back in March, which caused a temporary grounding of all aircraft at the Colorado base. That was one of four Apache mishaps in the space of two months. A pair of AH-64s assigned to 4th Combat Aviation Brigade. US Army A pair of AH-64 Apaches assigned to the 4th Combat Aviation Brigade. US Army In April, Army officials ordered a service-wide aviation safety 'standup' in the wake of 12 total crashes and 10 fatalities in the preceding six months. The service had suffered just nine Class A aviation mishaps in all of Fiscal Year 2023, according to Task & Purpose. At the time of writing, the U.S. military currently defines a Class A mishap as one in which the total assessed damage is $2.5 million or more; a crewed aircraft is deemed completely 'destroyed, missing, or abandoned'; at least one fatality or total permanent disability occurs; or some combination thereof. 'Of the numerous accidents we had this year, there was, there was not a single finding like 'this is the problem we have in aviation.' It's multifaceted,' Brig. Gen. Matthew Braman, Director of Army Aviation within the service's headquarters at the Pentagon, said earlier this month. '[The] majority of those findings are things that reside down at the unit level, where unit commanders can enforce policy existing policies that work.' Braman comments came during a panel discussion at the Association of the Army's main annual conference (AUSA) in Washington, D.C. 'There's also Army-level fixes that we're looking at. So, some of those are material fixes&#8230; certainly on the Apache side they're looking at ways to make improvements on certain aspects,' Braman added. A potentially serious issue with electrical power generators on Army AH-64s notably emerged last year, which service officials have said since they have been looking for long-term solutions to resolve. Braman also highlighted unspecified training and other materiel factors. The aftermath of another one of this year's Apache mishaps, this one occurring on February 13 and involving a Utah Army National Guard AH-64D.

There are no indications one way or the other currently that what happened at Fort Carson in August was the result of any negligence. We do now have a much fuller picture of just how significant the damage at Butts Army Heliport that left dozens of helicopters impacted.

Israel’s Reprisal Strike Carefully Calculated, Unclear If Jets Ev...	Israel's retaliation strike on Iran targeted air defense positions and long-range weapons facilities. Carried out primarily by the Israeli Air Force, it was a limited attack meant to weaken Tehran's offensive and defensive capabilities and to highlight Israel's deep strike capabilities. The strikes on air defense sites, in particular, made Iran more vulnerable to a larger follow-up strike, a clear deterrent against further escalation. By sticking to strictly military targets with few reported casualties, the operation also fell within the guidelines suggested by the Biden administration, and the threshold Iranian officials had previously suggested would result in no further kinetic actions. The strikes were in retaliation for the massive Oct. 1 Iranian ballistic missile barrage on Israel. Some 20 targets were hit, 'including the S-300 air defense of Imam Khomeini International Airport which provides defense cover for parts of the sprawling capital,' The New York Times reported, citing two Iranian officials, including a member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp (IRGC). 'In Tehran Province, at least three Revolutionary Guards missile bases were attacked, the officials said,' according to The Times. 'In a second round of Israeli strikes, the officials said, Israeli drones targeted the secretive Parchin military base in the outskirts of Tehran and one drone hit the base while others were shot down, they added.' It is unclear exactly what drones would have been used or if the weapon type stated is indeed accurate. U.S. and Israeli officials 'reported that three waves of airstrikes took place on Saturday morning local time, later named Operation Days of Repentance, the Jerusalem Post reported. 'The first wave targeted Iran’s air defense system, while the second and third focused on missile and drone bases and weapons production sites.' Satellite images emerged on social media purporting to show damage to a facility in Khojir as well as Iran's new solid-propellant rocket motor plant in Parchin, about 950 miles east of Israel. The plant was opened in 2021, according to Fabian Hinz, a Research Fellow Defense and Military Analysis at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. It is reportedly associated with the production of fuel for Scud, Fateh 110, and Zelzal ballistic missiles, we previously reported. In October 2014, there was a massive explosion at Parchin, which many believed was the result of sabotage by Israeli or American intelligence services.

Source: @ArmedForcesJO @Petranews ⁦@AlMamlakaTV⁩ Dana Zureikat Daoud دانا زريقات (@DanaZkat) October 26, 2024 As expected, Israel launched munitions over Iraq. Video and images emerged on social media purported to show a spent booster from an Israeli air-launched ballistic missile that was found in Iraq. The last and only time Israel struck Iran directly using traditional airpower came last Spring after Iran sent a barrage of drones and missiles at Israel. Following that Israeli response, it became clear an air-launched ballistic missiles were used to do so. A booster for one of these weapons, which Israel has an impressive and growing portfolio of, was found in a field in Iraq close to the Iran-Iraq border. TWZ did a breakdown on exactly what was found and its implications you can read here. Yesterday we posited that more of these would show up in this area today. These weapons, which include Rocks and Air LORA, allow the IAF to strike deep into another country from great standoff distances and do so with a weapon that hits very hard with high-accuracy and is extremely challenging to intercept. Another Missile Booster was found in Samarra city, western Salah Alden. #Iraq pic.twitter.com/QETVOGmDKo&mdash; Tammuz Intel (@Tammuz_Intel) October 26, 2024 Missile booster was found in Salah Alden Governorate, northern #Iraq, that was used in last night's attack on Tehran. #Iran pic.twitter.com/T1LzB7yuOY&mdash; Tammuz Intel (@Tammuz_Intel) October 26, 2024 Lots of spent air launched ballistic missile boosters near the Iran-Iraq border will likely show up on social media tomorrow.&mdash; Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) October 26, 2024 The question still remains if any IAF crewed assets ever even entered into Iranian airspace. Standoff munitions, especially air-launched ballistic missiles, could have been responsible for striking the limited target sets that were hit. This would have several critical advantages. First, doing so would result in a far less complex, lower-risk operation that could be executed and finished in a number of hours not days, with much fewer assets needed over a much shorter timeframe. It would also not necessitate the U.S. being directly involved in the operation, especially in a support role, such as providing aerial refueling. Second, the risk of losing a crew and having to attempt a rescue would also be far less of an issue as it would be only limited to Syria and Iraq, where Israel already operates and has long-standing contingency plans for. While Jordan and Saudi Arabia, if their airspace was used, have better diplomatic ties with Israel to deal with such an occurrence, and still CSAR could be able to cover those areas as well. The distance and hostility related to Iran makes doing so a much more risky and complex affair. Third, using standoff weapons, once again especially ALBMs, the suppression/destruction of enemy air defenses campaign could also be drastically reduced, if needed really at all. Many special capabilities, such as electronic warfare and cyber attacks, could be withheld for future contingencies. It's still possible that unmanned platforms were used even if manned ones were not, potentially including clandestine ones with penetrating capabilities. These are just some key points, there are others including adhering to U.S. demands as far as the mission's scope and risk for rapid escalation. The IDF released images and video showing F-15 and F-16 fighters that took part in the attack. One of those F-15 Bazs, marked 957 'Sky Blazer,' has an interesting history. 'It was involved in a mid-air collision with an A-4 during a training exercise over the Negev in 1983, according to Times of Israel reporter Emanuel Fabian. 'The F-15 managed to land safely and was later repaired.' Over the years, 'Sky Blazer has downed 4.5 Syrian planes (half because another F-15 was involved in shooting down a Syrian MiG-23 in 1985, and it was unclear which one launched the missile that ultimately caused the plane to be shot down),' he added. 'The same F-15 also participated in September's strikes on the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen.' Fun fact about the F-15 marked 957 'Sky Blazer' seen in this video.

The question of if and how Tehran will respond looms large over the region. 'It is too soon to say,' an administration official told The War Zone Saturday. On Saturday, U.S. President Joe Biden 'convened a call with Vice President Kamala Harris and their national security team to receive a briefing and discuss the latest developments in the Middle East following Israel’s precise response to Iran’s ballistic missile attack on October 1st,' according to the White House press pool. 'President Biden directed that every effort be taken to protect our forces and help defend Israel against any potential responses from Iran and its proxies.' 'I was on with the intelligence community for the last half hour,' Biden said. 'It looks like they didn’t hit anything other than military targets. I hope that this is the end.' Iranian authorities 'strongly condemned' the attack, saying they reserved the right to respond. However, they downplayed the results, a possible indication that they may not. Iran’s Foreign Ministry on Saturday decried yesterday’s attack against military targets 'as a clear violation of the international law, the UN Charter, and the article on the prohibition of threat or use of force against the territorial integrity and sovereignty of states, according to the official Tasnim news agency. 'On the basis of its inherent right to legitimate defense, stipulated in Article 51 of the UN Charter, the Islamic Republic of Iran considers itself to be rightful and duty bound to defend against the foreign acts of aggression.'

To that end, it Israeli officials contacted Iran before the attack and said what they would and would not hit, according to the Jerusalem Post.

'You played with the lion's tail,' warned Hesamoddin Ashena, adviser to former Iranian president Hassan Rouhani. '&#8230; This is Iran.' In what may be an indication of the government’s intentions, Iranian state media messaging dismissed the Israeli attack. They said it caused little damage and no upheaval to civilian life. Officials said air defenses downed most of the incoming missiles, no oil refineries or nuclear facilities were hit, and that casualties were limited to four soldiers who were killed. Outlets like Tasnim and IRNA portrayed a return to calm in Iran, with markets bustling, streets filled with traffic, and aircraft arriving and departing from Imam Airport in Tehran.

B-21 Taking On Some Of NGAD Fighter’s Missions On The Table Air F...	The U.S. Air Force has not ruled out expanding the roles and missions of the B-21 Raider stealth bomber as part of its ongoing reassessment of plans for a new crewed sixth-generation stealth 'fighter.' This is not the first time the service has at least alluded to the possibility of an air-to-air combat role for the Raider. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin talked about the B-21 and the future of the sixth-generation combat jet that has been under development as part of his service's Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative earlier today at the 2024 Military Reporters & Editors (MRE) Conference. The plans for the NGAD aircraft, also sometimes referred to as the Penetrating Counter-Air (PCA) platform, are currently undergoing a deep review. Concerns about very high expected costs – individual fighter-like NGAD aircraft potentially costing $300 million or more apiece – have been cited as the central driver behind the reassessment. The first pre-production B-21 Raider. USAF The first pre-production B-21 Raider at Plant 42 ahead of its first flight. USAF 'We intend to have that by December,' Allvin said when asked about the timeline for when the NGAD combat jet review is expected to be finished. 'We also want to be able to influence the&#8230; [proposed] budget submission in February. So, obviously, all that has to go through DOD [the Department of Defense]. So we're looking to have the results in December.' 'As the NGAD review goes forward, like, is it possible that what that ends up with could be the B-21 taking a larger role?' Defense News' Stephen Losey asked Allvin later in his talk. 'We have not taken that off the table,' the Air Force's top officer said in response. Allvin did not elaborate on what this might mean for the B-21, but as already noted, this is not the first time the possibility of an 'air dominance' role for the Raider has come up. 'If we were to characterize it [NGAD] as a fighter, we would be… thinking too narrowly about what kind of airplane we need in a highly contested environment,' then-Air Force Maj. Gen. Scott Pleus, told what was then Air Force Magazine back in 2019. 'A B-21 that also has air-to-air capabilities' and can 'work with the family of systems to defend itself, utilizing stealth – maybe that’s where the sixth-generation airplane comes from.' At the time, Pleus was Director of Air and Cyber Operations for Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), the Air Force's top command in that region. Now a lieutenant general, he is currently Director of Staff at the Air Force's Headquarters at the Pentagon. It remains unclear whether Pleus' 2019 comments explicitly reflected an idea for employing the B-21 in air-to-air combat, or if he was referring to a similarly sized and/or otherwise capable aircraft. Renderings of very stealthy tailless designs, like the one below from Lockheed Martin, have historically been used to illustrate discussions about the NGAD combat jet. Lockheed Martin At the same time, as The War Zone has explored in detail in the past, the B-21's size, long range, high-altitude ceiling, broadband low-observability (stealthiness), and other capabilities could actually make it well suited to supporting certain forms of air-to-air combat. The Raider has the potential to serve as a launch platform for air-to-air missiles, especially outsized very long-range types. Its payload capacity would give it the ability to carry a large volume of smaller air-to-air missiles, as well. B-21s could also employ air-to-ground munitions in support of the suppression and destruction of enemy air defenses mission (SEAD/DEAD), which is also part of the air superiority equation. Maybe most significantly, the B-21s could also act as airborne nerve centers in support of counter-air missions, especially for controlling drones like the Air Force's planned fleets of Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA), and have the ability to do so even in the most heavily contested of airspaces. Uncrewed aircraft, in turn, could feed targeting data back to Raiders with air-to-air loadouts. B-21s might even be able to launch some of those drones themselves. The video below from Collins Aerospace offers a good visual depiction of how CCA-type drones might work together with crewed aircraft in an air-to-air combat scenario, including by extending the sensor reach of the entire force. 'What is the role, if any, of a CAA in consonance with the B-21 as it’s fielded?' then-Air Force Lt. Gen. James Slife, at the time Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, asked rhetorically at the annual Defense News Conference last year. 'We should we should keep our options open for how we employ them going forward.' Gen. Slife is now Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force. Labeling the B-21 as simply a bomber is already something of a misnomer. 'The B-21 is multi-functional,' Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said at the roll-out ceremony for the first pre-production Raider in December 2022. 'It can handle anything from gathering intel to battle management.' The first pre-production B-21 in flight. USAF How any increased role for the B-21 might impact broader plans for the Raider is unclear. Allvin took the time today to push back on comments this week from Kathy Warden, CEO of Northrop Grumman, the prime contractor for the B-21, about possible changes on the horizon to the planned Raider force structure. The Air Force's publicly stated plan remains to buy 100 of these aircraft. 'I can see that being something in the future [that changes]. &#8230;we do not currently have a plan to do that in the next month or two,' Allvin said. 'I think we'll understand more about it [as testing proceeds] that will give us more confidence [about fleet size].' 'But there's also going forward to understand the capability, the capabilities that are bearing out, along with the price point,' the Air Force Chief of Staff continued. 'So far, the program has been run very well, and so the usual price ballooning we haven't seen.' 'We do not have that on the front burner right now to re-evaluate' the planned B-21 fleet size, he added. In April, Allvin had also told members of Congress that 100 B-21s was still the plan, as well as that his service was already looking ahead to augment the Raiders with new capabilities. Photo courtesy of Jonathan Case, Northrop Grumman It is important to stress that the reassessment of the NGAD combat jet plans is ongoing and we know it is intended to be exhaustive. Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall has talked repeatedly now about how the service is also considering a significantly cheaper (and similarly less capable in certain regards) crewed stealth aircraft focused primarily on the drone controller mission as another alternative. You can read more about what that plane could look like here. With the Air Force hoping to have the completed review of its NGAD 'fighter' plans in hand before the end of the year, it might not be too long before more details about its conclusions, and how they may or may not relate to the B-21, start trickling out.

NATO Flexes With Simultaneous Nuclear Strike And Naval Warfare Ex...	Steadfast Noon, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s annual tactical nuclear weapons exercise in Europe, was completed yesterday, having been run simultaneously with the British-led Strike Warrior large-scale maritime maneuvers, centered around a British Carrier Strike Group. The combined drills sent a powerful message to Russia, not just in terms of NATO’s enduring nuclear strike potential in Europe but also in regards to its diverse conventional military capabilities spread across the continent. This year’s Exercise Steadfast Noon began on October 14 and ended on October 24. In a statement, the alliance confirmed that 'more than 60' aircraft took part, as well as around 2,000 military personnel from eight air bases. #steadfastnoon24 is a two week EX conducted in the area of Western Europe. The main purpose is to train the Allies in Nuclear deterrence. For the first time, the F35-A is showing her abilities. #strongertogether @NATO pic.twitter.com/gkPIf16NPw&mdash; NATO JFC Naples (@JFC_Naples) October 23, 2024 Steadfast Noon is concerned entirely with nuclear deterrence and involves training flights over Western Europe each fall. The aircraft that take part are nuclear-capable but there are no live warheads used in the exercise. In the past, we have explored exactly what procedures are likely practiced in Steadfast Noon and how these drills are a cornerstone for ensuring readiness to launch a nuclear attack during a crisis. Under the NATO nuclear-sharing arrangement, U.S. B61 nuclear gravity bombs are understood to be housed in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Turkey, and can be employed by tactical jet aircraft from approved member states. Turkey notably hosts B61s, but is not among the countries that could employ them. Non-strategic NATO combat jets currently capable of carrying nuclear weapons include the F-15E, F-35A, F-16, and Tornado. They are referred to as Dual-Capable Aircraft (DCAs) in NATO parlance, and you can read more about them here. A frontal view of four B61 nuclear gravity bombs on a bomb cart. Defense Department photo by SSGT PHIL SCHMITTEN 'Nuclear deterrence is the cornerstone of allied security,' NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said, ahead of this year’s exercise. 'Steadfast Noon is an important test of the Alliance’s nuclear deterrent and sends a clear message to any adversary that NATO will protect and defend all allies.' The host countries for this year’s Steadfast Noon were Belgium and the Netherlands (Kleine Brogel and Volkel air bases, respectively), with most training flights taking place over these nations, as well as over Denmark, the United Kingdom, and the North Sea.

A notable feature of this year’s nuclear exercise was the involvement of Royal Netherlands Air Force F-35As, for the first time since these were declared ready to perform nuclear roles, with the B61-12 thermonuclear bomb. You can read more about this development here. An F-35A drops an inert B61-12 bomb during a certification test flight. U.S. Air Force B-52s have been involved in Steadfast Noon before. Although Steadfast Noon is a tactical nuclear exercise and the Stratofortress is a strategic platform, the exercise also involves a range of aircraft working in packages to get the Dual-Capable Aircraft into the target area. Such scenarios could include B-52s delivering conventional weapons. For some time now, the only nuclear weapons available to the B-52 are cruise missiles – currently AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missiles (ALCMs) that are set to be eventually replaced by new AGM-181 Long Range Stand-Off (LRSO) types. Supporting these nuclear strike platforms were various fighter escorts, aerial refueling tankers, airborne early warning, and electronic warfare aircraft.

Matthews, JADTEU In all, 13 NATO nations took part on some level. According to reports ahead of Steadfast Noon, other countries involved comprised the Czech Republic (with Gripen multirole fighters), Denmark (F-16), Finland (F/A-18), Greece (F-16), Poland (F-16), Romania (F-16), Turkey (F-16), and the United Kingdom (F-35B and Typhoon). Meanwhile, non-nuclear-capable Eurofighter EF2000s from both Germany and Italy were also listed as participants.

The country applied to join the alliance in May 2022, along with Sweden, in response to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Poland, meanwhile, is not currently a member of NATO’s nuclear weapon-sharing program but has expressed an interest in at least hosting weapons in the past. This policy position has been underscored by concerns over Russia’s decision last year to forward-deploy nuclear weapons in Belarus in cooperation with that country’s military.

In particular, the think tank notes that there has been significant recent modernization of infrastructure at nuclear-tasked air bases in Europe. 'This modernization involves security upgrades to the underground vaults that store the U.S. nuclear weapons, underground cables and nuclear command and control systems, and facilities needed for the new F-35A nuclear-capable fighter-bomber,' FAS states in its related report.

Public Domain/WikiCommons Modernization has included special loading pads at Kleine Brogel in Belgium, Ghedi in Italy, and Volkel in the Netherlands to receive U.S. Air Force C-17 airlifters that transport nuclear weapons and service equipment. Kleine Brogel has also received major upgrades to its weapons maintenance facilities, where nuclear weapons are stored and worked on. At Volkel, FAS has identified the construction of a new wall in front of an aircraft parking area, to keep this hidden from spotters and other observers outside the base. NATO's annual tactical nuclear weapons exercise Steadfast Noon begins today. Here is a backgrounder including what is happening at the different nuclear bases: pic.twitter.com/4aAX7SvDEu&mdash; Hans Kristensen (@nukestrat) October 14, 2024 In Germany, Büchel air base is midway through an upgrade that is adding, among others, a service area for Germany’s future nuclear-capable F-35As and a refurbished runway. There is also evidence here of security upgrades for the nuclear weapons area and a possible loading pad for C-17s. One other NATO air base in particular has come under extensive scrutiny in recent months. This is RAF Lakenheath in England, used by the U.S. Air Force, where the nuclear mission is expected to return after a long absence. The base is home to the 48th Fighter Wing, part of U.S. Air Forces in Europe, which includes squadrons of nuclear-capable F-15Es and F-35As. One of the first F-35As for the 48th Fighter Wing (specifically, the constituent 495th Fighter Squadron) touches down at RAF Lakenheath in December 2021. U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Koby I. Saunders However, there is still a degree of mystery around the nature of the nuclear mission at the U.K. base. Since 2022, Lakenheath has been listed as one of the NATO bases undergoing nuclear upgrades. The Pentagon has remained tight-lipped about this, but construction work on new aircraft shelters and underground vaults to store nuclear weapons has been confirmed by satellite images. Whether nuclear weapons will be permanently stored at Lakenheath is unclear and it remains possible that the facilities here are intended as a backup for the other air bases in Europe with a NATO nuclear mission. The total number of aircraft in Steadfast Noon appears to have been a modest increase over the number of aircraft involved in last year’s drill ('up to 60') but more significant is the fact that NATO air forces in Europe were simultaneously engaged in Exercise Strike Warrior. The U.K.-run Strike Warrior maneuvers took place primarily off the coast of Scotland over the same timeframe and had the main role of confirming that the U.K. Royal Navy’s Carrier Strike Group, centered around the aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales, is ready for operations.

Russia’s Iskander-M short-range ballistic missile can carry a nuclear or a conventional warhead and is among the country’s available tactical nuclear weapons. Vitaly Kuzmin via Wikimedia The rhetoric from Moscow has included repeated threats by President Vladimir Putin to use nuclear weapons, as he seeks to thwart NATO support for Ukraine and, especially, to try and ensure that limits remain on Ukraine’s use of Western-supplied long-range weapons to strike targets within Russia’s recognized borders. Moscow has also held its own high-profile tactical nuclear exercises. These drills have been accompanied by the announcement of possible changes to Russia’s nuclear doctrine. These have included the suggestion that the Kremlin’s threshold for the potential use of nuclear weapons may have been lowered, although the exact permutations of this — and whether it really constitutes a significant change — have been subject to some debate. NATO has always reiterated that the Steadfast Noon isn’t targeted toward any nation, in particular. A NATO video published yesterday described a 'fictitious red adversary,' although the identity of the alliance’s primary nuclear foe has always been clear. #SteadfastNoon24 showcases NATO's nuclear deterrence in today’s world.

Since then, there have been growing concerns that a European NATO member could be next. In that context, exercises that put to the test the nuclear and conventional might of the alliance, like those carried out in recent days, have become especially relevant.

Our First Look At The Ghost Shark Uncrewed Submarine Underwater	We have now gotten our first look at the Ghost Shark extra-large autonomous undersea vehicle (XL-AUV) operating submerged thanks to the Autonomous Warrior 2024 maritime autonomous capabilities demonstration in Australia. The Royal Australian Navy (RAN) is the first known customer for the highly modular Ghost Shark, which manufacturer Anduril is now pitching elsewhere, including to the U.S. Navy. The Australian Department of Defense released a video montage, seen below, from Autonomous Warrior 2024 that includes clips of Ghost Shark below the waves this week. The event took place predominantly in and around Jervis Bay on Australia's eastern coast over a period of three weeks earlier this month. There are two separate clips of the Ghost Shark in the Autonomous Warrior 2024 video, captures from which are seen at the top of this story and below. In both cases, the top of the mast at the front of the drone submarine appears to be blurred out. Australian Department of Defense capture Ghost Shark's mast, which is distinctly lower profile than what is typically found on other uncrewed underwater vehicles (UUV), is a particularly notable feature of the design. Otherwise, what can be seen in the Autonomous Warrior 2024 video looks to be in line with imagery of the drone submarine that has been released since it first broke cover in April. 'We don’t have big masts running down the backbone of our vehicle that a lot of other designs do that then preclude the ability for the payloads to come out in different directions… of the payload module itself,' Dr. Shane Arnott, Senior Vice President for Engineering at Anduril and the company’s maritime lead, told The War Zone in an interview back in August. 'So we have… in effect, unlimited flexibility in this design, just the way that we’ve configured the vehicle and the payload bay itself could be almost anything within a size configuration that you can dream up. We haven’t encountered crazy idea yet from a customer that … we can’t fit.' Australian Defense Force Australian authorities have said they expect to use their future fleet of Ghost Sharks for 'persistent intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance [ISR] and strike,' but have provided no additional details so far about how the drone submarines might be configured to perform those missions. Anduril has also declined to provide more specific information about the UUV's capabilities, including its maximum range and endurance. You can read more about what is known about the design to date here. Regardless, events like Autonomous Warrior 2024 offer important opportunities for the RAN and Anduril to further test and refine Ghost Shark capabilities, as well as explore how they can be alongside other crewed and uncrewed platforms. Anduril announced earlier this year that it had brought a Ghost Shark to the United States for the first time as part of efforts to expand its capacity to test the UUV, as well as demonstrate it to prospective customers. 'There’s just a lot of test points for us to hit. So, having the ability to have multiple Ghost Sharks, and particularly in different waters around the world, such that we can burn down those test points and just grow our trust and the customer’s trust by testing and ‘show me, don’t tell me,’ is kind of a really big part of why we’ve done this [bringing the UUV to the United States,' Anduril's Arnott explained to us earlier this year. A Ghost Shark drone submarine being lowered into the water during previous testing. Australian Defense Force Ghost Shark was not the only uncrewed platform involved in Autonomous Warrior 2024, which is part of a larger Australian maritime autonomy initiative called Maritime Big Play (MBP) and is also tied in with the 'advanced capabilities' Pillar II of the trilateral Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS) defense cooperation agreement. Pillar I of the AUKUS agreement centers on the RAN's acquisition and fielding of a nuclear-powered submarine force and assisting with that effort. Maritime Big Play also has links to the U.S. military's Technology Readiness Experimentation (T-REX) effort and NATO's Robotic Experimentation and Prototyping Augmented by Maritime Unmanned Systems (REPMUS) exercise series, according to the Pentagon. The U.S. Navy has also been conducting a growing number of large-scale uncrewed-focused maritime exercises and demonstration events in recent years. Also seen in the Australian Department of Defense video are Greenough Advanced Rescue Craft (GARC), Swiftships Sea-Stalker, and Ocius Bluebottle uncrewed surface vessels, as well as a REMUS-series UUV. Ocean Aero's Triton hybrid UUV/USV and at least one other larger UUV design are visible at points in the montage, too, as are various uncrewed aerial systems and high-altitude balloons. GARC (at left) and Sea-Stalker USVs in use at Autonomous Warrior 2024. Australian Department of Defense capture A trio of Ocius Bluebottle USVs sail together during Autonomous Warrior 2024.

Australian Department of Defense capture There are two clips showing the apparent launch of a payload from the hull of what may be a docked RAN Collins class submarine based on a flag seen in the background. What is being fired and why is not entirely clear, but it has a torpedo-like outward appearance and could be an expendable countermeasure of some kind. The U.S. Navy and others have also been actively working on submarine-launched aerial drones and UUVs, including types small enough to be launched from existing countermeasures launchers. A screen capture showing the payload launch. Australian Department of Defense capture Another view of the payload launch. Australian Department of Defense capture 'A versatile and robust software-defined network architecture called Multi-Domain Uncrewed Secure Integrated Communications (MUSIC) was tested for its ability to enable seamless communication and coordination across diverse unmanned systems and operational environments' during Autonomous Warrior 2024, according to a Pentagon press release. 'The Common Control System (CCS) was also featured in the exercise, built on an open architecture to provide uncrewed vehicles hardware and software that works across several different systems. This effort supports future work to create an AUKUS-wide Common Control System, fusing [the] best elements of the three countries’ existing systems.' The three AUKUS partners increasingly see uncrewed maritime platforms above and below the waves, as well as aerial drones, as not only important, but critical for providing increased sensor coverage, wider and more resilient communications networks, and other capabilities, and for doing so in cost-effective manners. The U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps, in particular, are envisioning future fleets of UUVs and USVs that can carry out kinetic attacks and employ electronic warfare and other non-kinetic effects, as well as emplace mines. The US Navy envisions its future Orca UUVs, the first of which is seen here with its top-mounted mast deployed and a payload module installed with a top-opening bay, as being uncrewed mine layers, at least initially. USN Evidence continues to grow from wargames carried out by the U.S. military and other organizations that uncrewed aerial and maritime capabilities could have especially decisive impacts in a future high-end fight across the broad expanses of the Pacific against China, especially one over Taiwan. With this in mind, America's armed forces have been helping Taiwan with a plan to defend the island against an invasion from the mainland by turning the airspace and waters into a 'hellscape' full of uncrewed platforms, as you can read more about here. 'Autonomous Warrior/Maritime Big Play creates a unique opportunity for our three countries to work together, which will ultimately improve operational efficiency and allow us to work more cohesively against common threats,' Heidi Shyu, Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, said in a statement about Autonomous Warrior 2024 this week. 'This collaborative approach enables us to reduce acquisition, maintenance, and training cost by creating economies of scale.' It's worth noting here that members of the Japan Self-Defense Forces observed Autonomous Warrior 2024, which was the first time members of that country's armed forces had been present at a Maritime Big Play event. Australian military officials brief their Japanese counterparts during Autonomous Warrior 2024. Australian Department of Defense 'All of this together underpins a more strategic approach to ensure that AUKUS and like-minded partners can operate new autonomous uncrewed systems more effectively as a coalition force from the start,' Madeline Mortelmans, the U.S. official currently performing the duties of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy, Plans and Capabilities, also said in a statement about Autonomous Warrior 2024 this week. The AUKUS triumvirate is now reportedly considering increasing Japan's involvement in Pillar II activities. This is in line with broader and largely U.S.-led efforts to create a more unified front among allies and partners in the Pacific to challenge Beijing. 'AUKUS partners have long histories of working together on defense and security issues, and have deep, enduring partnerships based on shared values,' Under Secretary Shyu said. 'By investing in novel and innovative capabilities directly aligned to AUKUS mission priorities, as well as making future advancements in emerging technologies like AI [artificial intelligence] and Quantum [computing], we support a more stable region — one where all nations are empowered to make their own sovereign decisions free from coercion — a world that centers on hope for the opportunity and prosperity of the future.'

Germany Plans To Buy Advanced New Taurus Cruise Missiles: Report	Germany has announced plans to acquire 600 examples of a new version of the Taurus air-launched conventional cruise missile, which would provide a major boost to the country’s long-range strike capabilities. Unclear is whether the Taurus Neo purchase might finally see approval for the transfer of older Taurus KEPD 350 weapons to Ukraine, with Berlin so far having blocked such a move despite Kyiv’s requests for them. Even if Ukraine gets its wish, it will be a long time before the Taurus Neo comes online, potentially freeing up older KEPD 350 versions. The German Minister of Defense Boris Pistorius wants to buy advanced versions of the missiles, but has yet to secure funds from the government, according to a report in the Spiegel magazine. A Taurus KEPD 350 cruise missile is loaded onto a German Tornado strike aircraft. MBDA MBDA The same source states that the 600 new missiles would cost around $2.3 billion and could see the first deliveries in 2029. Pistorius plans for the Taurus Neo to be included as an option in the 2025 budget, which would require a starting investment of around $379 million. The Luftwaffe or German Air Force already received 600 of the original Taurus KEPD 350 missiles, which have a range of more than 500 kilometers (311 miles). In German service, these are launched from the Tornado swing-wing strike fighter. Although they have also been tested from the Eurofighter EF2000, the Luftwaffe doesn’t currently use the more modern fighter as a Taurus delivery platform. A German Eurofighter EF2000 jet seen carrying a pair of Taurus cruise missiles, but the capability to employ them from EF2000s was never fully developed. Philipp Hayer/Wikimedia Commons It’s unclear what platform the Taurus Neo would be launched from, but the upcoming retirement of the Tornado fleet makes this much less likely. That would leave the Eurofighter as the most likely option. Potential integration on the F-35A stealth fighter, which Germany has also ordered, seems highly unlikely, with the missile needing a significant redesign to even fit in the internal weapons bay on the U.S.-made jet. Looking further ahead, Germany could plan to add the Taurus Neo to the crewed fighter that will be at the center of the next-generation combat aircraft program being pursued by Belgium, France, Germany, and Spain, known as the Future Combat Air System, or FCAS. The original Taurus KEPD 350 was designed to destroy high-value targets deep behind enemy lines, including command bunkers, ammunition and fuel dumps, airfields, and bridges. A Taurus missile in flight. Photo by South Korean Defense Ministry via Getty Images Designed to penetrate air defenses via a very low-level terrain following flight, the turbojet-powered Taurus missile carries a 1,060-pound dual-stage warhead, known as MEPHISTO. This uses a precursor charge to punch through hardened structures followed by the main change that can be fuzed for penetration mode when required, meaning it detonates after breaching the target. The MEPHISTO warhead can also be programmed to detonate on a specific pre-selected floor of a given building. The missile guidance system is based on an inertial navigation system (INS) that is continuously provided with GPS updates. There is also an image-based terrain reference sensor, which provides the capability to attack what the manufacturer describes as 'semi-stationary targets.' There are so far no details available about the improvements planned for the Taurus Neo, although potential changes could involve extended range, more destructive warhead, low-observable features, a new seeker, or a combination of these. Less likely, but also potentially under consideration could be increased speed, perhaps combined with defensive countermeasures to better defeat advanced air defense systems. Other modifications to improve the chances of penetrating hostile air defenses could include electronic support measures (ESM) to autonomously avoid the highest-threat areas. There’s also the possibility of a new-production version of the missile with relatively minor changes compared with the original KEPD 350. Speaking this summer, Thomas Gottschild, the managing director of MBDA Deutschland GmbH, which makes the missile, confirmed that although not currently in production, the assembly line could be reactivated at short notice. 'What we need is an order to activate our supply chain, a good dozen suppliers contribute to a complex missile like Taurus. These suppliers only start working for us with an order,' Gottschild said. However, the high costs involved in the program suggest that the Taurus Neo will likely feature several enhancements over its predecessor. Two quick points: First, 2029 is obviously a long way off, with even more time until the order is fully completed—if it reaches that scale.Second, funding has yet to be secured, and hopefully, they will manage to source the necessary budget. In my view, this should be an…&mdash; Fabian Hoffmann (@FRHoffmann1) October 25, 2024 The news of Germany’s Taurus Neo plans comes just two days after the signing of a landmark defense agreement between Germany and the United Kingdom, which you can read more about here. The two countries agreed to work together to 'rapidly develop' new extended deep strike weapons. Although no more details were provided, such weapons are planned to fly further and attack targets with greater precision than the Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missile used by the U.K. Royal Air Force. That agreement followed the announcement at the NATO Defense Ministers meeting in Brussels last week that the United Kingdom was joining the European Long-Range Strike Approach (ELSA) initiative, a French-led effort that involves Germany, Poland, and Italy. Previous announcements state that ELSA envisages a missile with a range of between 1,000 and 2,000 kilometers (621 and 1,243 miles) and that it should be in service by the 2030s. The will join the European long-range Strike Approach. Working alongside international allies, including our key ally , we will develop new long range missile capabilities to meet a critical NATO capability priority and bolster European security.#StrongerTogether UK Defence in France (@UKDefenceFrance) October 18, 2024 Exactly how the Taurus Neo would fit into either of these programs is unclear, but it provides more evidence of the growing interest in long-range strike weapons in Europe. The United States and Germany have also announced that U.S. long-range missiles will be stationed in Germany on an 'episodic' basis starting in 2026, including the SM-6 multi-purpose missile and Tomahawk cruise missile as well as 'developmental hypersonic weapons,' which is a likely reference to the Dark Eagle, which is due to be fielded soon, and others. The renewed focus on long-range strike has been driven, above all, by developments in Russian tactical nuclear missiles, which are being fielded in increasingly advanced and long-reaching forms. New types of missiles and new deployments have been accompanied by repeated nuclear threats from President Vladimir Putin as well as suggestions that Russia’s threshold for the potential use of nuclear weapons may have been lowered. The Taurus KEPD 350 is broadly similar to the Storm Shadow and SCALP-EG cruise missiles, which have been supplied to Ukraine by the United Kingdom, France, and Italy. A donated British Storm Shadow cruise missile carried under the wing of a Ukrainian Su-24 strike aircraft. via X Twitter screencap However, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has repeatedly denied requests by Ukraine to supply it with the Taurus. The German government has cited its concerns over Ukraine using the missile to strike targets deep inside Russia. The Storm Shadow and SCALP-EG were supplied to Kyiv on the understanding that they wouldn’t be used for such missions, though there have been reports that these restrictions might have been at least partially relaxed. The fact that Germany has decided it needs air-launched cruise missiles at this point may well also be another factor against Ukraine getting older Taurus KEPD 350 weapons. With a clear demand for weapons in this class, the current stocks of KEPD 350s are only likely to be retained longer, pending the introduction of the Taurus Neo. Of the original 600 Taurus KEPD 350s reported once in the German inventory, as many as half of these are said to be not ready for operational use after their certification expired. Stocks will also have been depleted over the years through examples being expended in tests or exercises, reducing the number that would be available to Ukraine. Should the German Ministry of Defense receive the funds it needs for the Taurus Neo program, it would ensure that the country’s air-launched long-range conventional strike capabilities keep pace with broader developments in air warfare. While it could allow the Taurus KEPD 350 to be phased out, along with the Tornado that carries it, it won’t necessarily see the older missiles approved for transfer to Ukraine, which is something that Berlin has stubbornly resisted so far.

Russians Helped Houthis Target International Shipping: Report	During its nine-month deployment to the Middle East, the USS Dwight D Eisenhower carrier strike group (IKECSG) fired off nearly 800 munitions fending off attacks on its ships and commercial vessels from the Houthis. Now a new report claims Russia gave the Yemeni rebel group targeting data in large measure to keep the U.S. entangled in the region and draw resources and attention away from Moscow's grinding war in Ukraine. The Houthis began attacking shipping in October of 2023 in support of Gaza and 'eventually began using Russian satellite data as they expanded their strikes,' The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. The publication cited 'a person familiar with the matter and two European defense officials.' The data 'was passed through members of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), who were embedded with the Houthis in Yemen,' one of the people told the Journal. Breaking: Russia provided satellite targeting data for Houthi rebels as they attacked Western ships in the Red Sea with missiles and drones earlier this year The Wall Street Journal (@WSJ) October 24, 2024 There is no indication in the Wall Street Journal’s report exactly when the data was supplied or if it contributed to any of the successful attacks on shipping. Regardless, the publication said it highlighted Russian President Vladimir Putin’s interest in undermining what the Pentagon keeps referring to as the U.S.-led 'rules-based order.' Responding to discussions about the U.S. and allies allowing Ukraine to strike deep into Russia with its donated weaponry, Putin threatened to send long-range weapons and military support to 'regions' around the world where they could be used for strikes against Western targets. 'For Russia, any flare-up anywhere is good news, because it takes the world’s attention further away from Ukraine,' Alexander Gabuev, director of Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, a think tank based in Berlin, told WSJ. Houthi attacks on shipping sucked up a lot of U.S. and allied resources. In addition to the IKECSG’s ships and aircraft, several other American and allied sea and air assets took part in defending shipping. They swatted away missiles and drones and blew up uncrewed surface vessels. They also attacked Houthi targets in Yemen. As we reported last week, B-2 Spirit stealth bombers, along with other U.S. forces, conducted a strike on Houthi underground weapon storage sites in Yemen. Land-based aircraft and other assets also took part in the fight. Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro disclosed at a Congressional hearing in April that his service alone had already expended at least $1 billion worth of munitions in operations against the Houthis since October 2023 and in the defense of Israel that month. The Navy was reported to have hit the 100 Standard Missiles fired mark by February of this year. The Dwight D. Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group expended 770 missiles and other munitions at Houthi targets over the course of its nine-month deployment. Capt. Chris 'Chowdah' Hill/USN There were also two international task forces created to defend Red Sea region shipping. The U.S.-led Operation Prosperity Guardian, which The War Zone was the first to write about, was stood up last December. The European-led Operation Aspides launched two months later. Despite all these assets deployed to the region, the Houthis kept up their attacks. Since launching this campaign a year ago, the militants attacked more than 100 ships, sinking two, damaging others, and hijacking another, the Journal noted. The following video shows the November 2023 Houthi hijacking of the Bahamian-flagged Galaxy Leader. NEW VIDEO: Yemen’s Houthi rebels hijack a cargo ship in the Red Sea over the weekend pic.twitter.com/pkkUJpbe5c&mdash; Trey Yingst (@TreyYingst) November 20, 2023 Those attacks disrupted global shipping, forcing companies to shift from passing through the Suez Canal to taking much longer, and more expensive routes around the Cape of Good Hope on the southern tip of Africa. 'Almost 1-in-10 barrels of oil shipped every day worldwide transit through Bab al-Mandab, the strait that separates the Red Sea from the Indian Ocean,' the Journal noted. 'The tanker traffic through that route was 77% lower in August 2024 compared with October 2023, according to Windward, a maritime-intelligence company.' Russian oil tankers have been hit by the Houthis as well, but they are part of a 'ghost fleet' created to circumvent international sanctions. Concerns about Russian assistance to the Houthis go beyond providing targeting data. The U.S. has been worried that Russia could further exacerbate the situation by providing the Houthis with its anti-ship or anti-air missiles as well as other weapons. Those arms could hinder efforts to protect shipping and place U.S. and allied forces at greater risk. However, there is no evidence that such transactions have occurred. Such a move would provide a huge boost to the large arsenal of anti-ship missiles already possessed by the Houthis, who became the first in the world to fire anti-ship ballistic missiles in anger. In addition to helping the Houthis, Russia may also be aiding Hezbollah in its fight against Israel. Last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israeli forces had found 'state-of-the-art' Russian weapons in searches of Hezbollah bases in south Lebanon. However, those weapons could also have been transferred by Iran or obtained by other means. Some of those weapons are on display in the following video.

We reached out to the National Security Council and the Pentagon for comment about the claim that Russia provided the Houthis with targeting data and if so, what they might do in response. We will update this story with any pertinent information provided.

Marines Testing Counter-Drone Rifle Aiming System With Automatica...	The U.S. Marines are testing a system for standard service rifles that automatically fine-tunes the point of aim with the help of a powered buttstock as a new option to help shoot down drones. The service is in the midst of a broad push to acquire new capabilities to help every Marine better protect themselves from ever-growing uncrewed aerial threats. The 3rd Marine Division in Hawaii released pictures today from a live-fire demonstration of a 5.56x45mm M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle (IAR) equipped with the ZeroMark Fire Control System (FCS). ZeroMark is a New York-based startup that was founded in 2022 and that says it has 'deep roots in Israel.' The company announced a new infusion of $7 million in venture capital funding to support the ongoing development of its counter-drone FCS back in May. A Marine fires an M27 IAR equipped with the ZeroMark FCS during a recent live-fire demonstration in Hawaii. USMC 'The ZeroMark FCS is an AI [artificial intelligence]-powered tool that enhances aim accuracy and counter-drone capabilities, providing Marines with a portable, real-time threat detection and response tool,' a caption for one of the pictures from the 3rd Marine Division says. C-UAS in soldiers’ hands.AI-powered accuracy.It’s coming. pic.twitter.com/hh38ON9Lfa&mdash; ZeroMark (@zeromarkinc) November 16, 2023 ZeroMark's system is not the first automated small arms targeting system the Marines have looked into in recent years with a particular eye toward helping engage drones. The service has also at least been evaluating SMASH 2000-series computerized optical sights from Israeli firm Smart Shooter. SMASH-series sights have the ability to detect and lock onto targets of interest, even ones on the move, and calculate an optimal aim point for the shooter. Depending on how the system is configured on a particular gun, it can even prevent the trigger from being pulled until the weapon is properly aimed at the target. The targeting system in ZeroMark's FCS is similar, in some very broad strokes, to that of the SMASH family. It uses an array of sensors, including electro-optical cameras and LIDAR, coupled with machine vision and advanced software algorithms, to acquire targets, according to the company. Where ZeroMark's offering differs most substantially is in its motorized articulating buttstock, which uses the data from the sensors to help physically move the gun's point of aim. This, in turn, helps the shooter engage the target with greater precision and speed. Screen captures from a ZeroMark promotional video seen earlier in this story showing how the buttstock is designed to articulate vertically (for evaluation) and laterally (for windage). ZeroMark captures '[The mechanized buttstock] doesn’t move the soldier’s arm, it creates a virtual pivot between shoulder pad and handheld positions that creates angular change of the bore axis (ultimately where the gun’s pointed),' ZeroMark CEO Joel Anderson said in an interview earlier this year, according to TechCrunch. 'The control systems for it are modeled to compensate for all the human factors (proprioception, noise, movement, torque, etc.) as well as the drone’s movement. So if you point in the general direction of the drone such that you’d be in the vicinity of a drone, the system does the rest.' Zeromark says it is also easy to install and uninstall as required on a wide variety of different rifle types. A promotional video seen earlier in this story shows prototypes or mock-ups of the system installed on rifles in the AK-47/AKM, AR-15/M16, and Tavor families, as seen below. ZeroMark captures Overall, ZeroMark says its FCS 'makes hitting a small drone at 200 yards as easy as hitting a 60-foot-diameter circle' at the same range, per TechCrunch. At least for now, the company has said work on its targeting system is focused on the counter-drone role, but has acknowledged that its system could be adapted for use against a wider array of target types in the future. The Marine Corps' interest in new ways to neutralize drones that it can add to its existing rifles and other small arms is certainly no secret. The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) put out a broad request for information (RFI) back in July that included a call for proposals for 'a rifle / rifle optic capable of tracking and defeating small UAS [uncrewed aerial systems],' as well as rifle-mounted electronic warfare jammers, specialized ammunition types, and other counter-small UAS (CsUAS) capabilities. 'The Joint CsUAS Office (JCO) has identified dismounted CsUAS capabilities as a vulnerability to the joint force. The Marine Corps Warfighting Lab (MCWL) identified the need for dismounted CsUAS throughout multiple experiments,' the RFI explained. 'Additionally, Tactical Training and Exercise Control Group (TTECG), Infantry Officer Course (IOC), both Schools of Infantry (SOI), and other units continue to fly threat UAS against Marine units during field exercises and training events. Each experiment and training exercise shows Marines are vulnerable to threat UAS and require the ability to defend themselves from the threat.' A US Marine with a standard M27 IAR. USMC This followed the Corps unveiling a three-tier plan to improve the ability of units at all levels to shield themselves from drones earlier this year. 'The threat is evolving in real time,' Lt. Col. Robert Barclay, the Marines’ ground-based air defense advisor for aviation expeditionary enablers, said at the Modern Day Marine expo in May. 'We were playing a cat-and-mouse game a lot of times, and that quite frankly gets a little cumbersome, and you don’t want to be behind the power curve.' The threat posed by various tiers of uncrewed aerial systems, including highly maneuverable first-person view (FPV) types turned into kamikaze drones and other weaponized commercial designs capable of dropping small improvised munitions, is not new. This is something The War Zone routinely highlights and the threat ecosystem looks to be on the verge of taking another major step forward thanks in large part to advances in artificial intelligence. The ongoing war in Ukraine, where both sides employ FPV and other drone types on a daily basis, has been especially central to finally thrusting the reality of drone threats into the mainstream consciousness. A global explosion of demand for counter-drone capabilities, including ones that individual personnel can carry, has followed.

Whether Marines or any other part of the U.S. armed forces ultimately adopts ZeroMark's FCS remains to be seen, but capabilities to help individual shooters engage drones and other targets faster and more accurately are increasingly becoming a top prioritiy.

U.S. Pushes Back On Claim Israel Delaying Iran Attack Over Docume...	The U.S. is pushing back against a claim made by The Times of London that Israel is delaying its expected retaliation strike against Iran because of the leak of a U.S. assessment of its war plans. 'We have no indication that Israel is delaying any action because of the document leak,' a U.S. official told The War Zone Thursday morning. 'Would steer you away from that.' Top secret documents leaked from the U.S. National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA) appeared last week on a pro-Iranian Telegram channel. They offered details about Israel’s advanced preparations for a large-scale strike in retaliation for the Oct. 1 Iranian missile barrage. The U.S. has not disputed their authenticity. It is possible Iran has obtained other documents not yet disclosed and it could signify a longer-term leak of information that remains unquantified, at least publicly. 'The leak of the American documents delayed the attack due to the need to change certain strategies and components,' an 'intelligence source with knowledge of Israeli deliberations' told The Times of London. 'There will be a retaliation, but it has taken longer than it was supposed to take.' Many factors can play into a military operation's timeline, especially an unprecedented one that would be highly complex and stretch Israel's long-range strike abilities. More basic elements are also important, including weather and moon states that are favorable to the operation and NEW: Israel has delayed its retaliatory strike against Iran because of a leak last week of potentially sensitive military information from the US The Times and The Sunday Times (@thetimes) October 24, 2024 Israel 'is concerned the leak could help Iran predict certain patterns of attack,' according to the publication. 'It has been forced to develop an alternative plan, one that requires detailed war gaming before any order is given, The Times understands.' The Netanyahu government has told the U.S. it won't strike Iran's nuclear facilities or oil infrastructure, the Washington Post reported. Instead, it will likely strike military targets. The Biden administration is working feverishly to tamp down tensions. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday that Israel's retaliation should not lead to greater escalation. Unlike the last rounds of attacks the two nations carried out against each other, an Israeli strike against Iran is likely to receive a quick response, setting off what could be a prolonged direct conflict between the long-time enemies.

'In the hideout, the troops located bunk beds, storage cabinets, food supplies, infrastructure for long-term stay, a large amount of equipment, weapons, and launch positions left behind by the terrorists.' Israeli troops located 'four enemy weapons storage facilities, some of which were placed in civilian homes,' the IDF said.

More than 1,200 Israelis were killed in that attack and more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed during Israel's massive military response. Blinken said Israel had accomplished its objective of 'effectively dismantling' Hamas, and that negotiations over a cease-fire and the release of dozens of Israeli hostages would resume in the coming days, The Associated Press reported. Speaking to reporters in Qatar, which has served as a key mediator between Israel and Hamas, Bliken said negotiators would reconvene 'in the coming days,' AP reported. 'What we really have to determine is whether Hamas is prepared to engage,' he said on his 11th visit to the region since the start of the war. The U.S. 'hopes to renew the negotiations after Israeli forces killed top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza last week, but neither side has shown any sign of moderating its demands from months of negotiations that sputtered to a halt over the summer,' the wire service stated. Blinken also announced an additional $135 million in U.S. aid to the Palestinians, while again urging Israel to allow more assistance to enter the territory.

The Associated Press (@AP) October 24, 2024 Al Jazeera said it conducted an investigation showing the extent to which the U.S. and U.K. have gone in support of Israel. The news outlet said an analysis of open-source flight tracking data showed over 6,000 military flights in a year, with hundreds transporting arms to Israel. Israel conducted only 20% of the 1,600 reconnaissance flights, while the U.K. was responsible for nearly half using Shadow R1 surveillance aircraft. The U.K. also provided targeting data during 645 flights. 'More than 1,200 military cargo flights made up the airlift over a year several bases in Europe were used with hundreds of flights from each from the UK, Germany, Italy, Cyprus and Greece,' Al Jazeera claimed. 'It is this air bridge, together with a vast number of surveillance flights and air-to-air refueling that has sustained Israel's brutal war on Gaza and how to expand its operations into southern Lebanon.' The U.K. MoD said it is not participating in the Israel-Hamas war. 'Our mandate is narrowly defined to focus on securing the release of the hostages only, including British nationals, with the RAF routinely conducting unarmed flights since December 2023 for this sole purpose,' the MoD told us in a statement.

U.S. Pushes Back On Claim Israel Delaying Iran Attack Over Docume...	The U.S. is pushing back against a claim made by The Times of London that Israel is delaying its expected retaliation strike against Iran because of the leak of a U.S. assessment of its war plans. 'We have no indication that Israel is delaying any action because of the document leak,' a U.S. official told The War Zone Thursday morning. 'Would steer you away from that.' Top secret documents leaked from the U.S. National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA) appeared last week on a pro-Iranian Telegram channel. They offered details about Israel’s advanced preparations for a large-scale strike in retaliation for the Oct. 1 Iranian missile barrage. The U.S. has not disputed their authenticity. It is possible Iran has obtained other documents not yet disclosed and it could signify a longer-term leak of information that remains unquantified, at least publicly. 'The leak of the American documents delayed the attack due to the need to change certain strategies and components,' an 'intelligence source with knowledge of Israeli deliberations' told The Times of London. 'There will be a retaliation, but it has taken longer than it was supposed to take.' Many factors can play into a military operation's timeline, especially an unprecedented one that would be highly complex and stretch Israel's long-range strike abilities. More basic elements are also important, including weather and moon states that are favorable to the operation and NEW: Israel has delayed its retaliatory strike against Iran because of a leak last week of potentially sensitive military information from the US The Times and The Sunday Times (@thetimes) October 24, 2024 Israel 'is concerned the leak could help Iran predict certain patterns of attack,' according to the publication. 'It has been forced to develop an alternative plan, one that requires detailed war gaming before any order is given, The Times understands.' The Netanyahu government has told the U.S. it won't strike Iran's nuclear facilities or oil infrastructure, the Washington Post reported. Instead, it will likely strike military targets. The Biden administration is working feverishly to tamp down tensions. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday that Israel's retaliation should not lead to greater escalation. Unlike the last rounds of attacks the two nations carried out against each other, an Israeli strike against Iran is likely to receive a quick response, setting off what could be a prolonged direct conflict between the long-time enemies.

Israeli aircraft 'pounded Beirut’s southern suburbs with strikes overnight, and six buildings were destroyed in the Laylaki neighborhood,' The Washington Post reported, citing Lebanese state media.

In one raid, 'the troops discovered an underground hideout intended to be used by 'Radwan Forces' terrorists in their plan 'Conquer the Galilee,' the IDF stated on Telegram. 'In the hideout, the troops located bunk beds, storage cabinets, food supplies, infrastructure for long-term stay, a large amount of equipment, weapons, and launch positions left behind by the terrorists.' Israeli troops located 'four enemy weapons storage facilities, some of which were placed in civilian homes,' the IDF said. 'The storage facilities contained a large number of weapons, including AK-47 rifles, ammunition, rockets, mortars, shoulder-fired missiles, RPGs, and advanced anti-tank missiles. All of the weapons were confiscated.' In addition, 'a tunnel was found inside a civilian house, which served as a weapons storage facility in a village in southern Lebanon,' the IDF claimed on Telegram. 'The troops located numerous weapons, terrorist infrastructure, and equipment intended to allow the terrorists to remain there for a long time. At the beginning of the recent targeted raids, the underground tunnel and enemy compounds were dismantled by the brigade and divisional engineering forces.' Elsewhere in southern Lebanon, 'the soldiers raided military structures, including a hotel that served as cover for Hezbollah's terrorist infrastructure,' the IDF stated. 'Inside, a weapons storage facility was found and dismantled, containing hundreds of anti-tank missile launcher positions and missiles that had been used to launch attacks on Galilee communities in recent months.'

More than 1,200 Israelis were killed in that attack and more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed during Israel's massive military response. Blinken said Israel had accomplished its objective of 'effectively dismantling' Hamas, and that negotiations over a cease-fire and the release of dozens of Israeli hostages would resume in the coming days, The Associated Press reported. Speaking to reporters in Qatar, which has served as a key mediator between Israel and Hamas, Bliken said negotiators would reconvene 'in the coming days,' AP reported. 'What we really have to determine is whether Hamas is prepared to engage,' he said on his 11th visit to the region since the start of the war. The U.S. 'hopes to renew the negotiations after Israeli forces killed top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza last week, but neither side has shown any sign of moderating its demands from months of negotiations that sputtered to a halt over the summer,' the wire service stated. Blinken also announced an additional $135 million in U.S. aid to the Palestinians, while again urging Israel to allow more assistance to enter the territory.

The Associated Press (@AP) October 24, 2024 As Blinken was delivering that message, Israel struck a school where displaced people were sheltering in the central Gaza Strip. The attack 'killed at least 17 people on Thursday, nearly all women and children,' the AP reported, citing Palestinian medical officials. 'Another 42 people were wounded in the strike in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp,' the AP added, citing the Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. 'Among the dead were 13 children under the age of 18 and three women, according to the hospital’s records.' The Israeli Air Force (IAF) 'conducted a strike on Hamas terrorists who were operating inside a command and control center in the area of Nuseirat,' the IDF claimed on Telegram without offering proof.

The Associated Press (@AP) October 24, 2024 Al Jazeera said it conducted an investigation showing the extent to which the U.S. and U.K. have gone in support of Israel. The news outlet said an analysis of open-source flight tracking data showed over 6,000 military flights in a year, with hundreds transporting arms to Israel. Israel conducted only 20% of the 1,600 reconnaissance flights, while the U.K. was responsible for nearly half using Shadow R1 surveillance aircraft. The U.K. also provided targeting data during 645 flights. 'More than 1,200 military cargo flights made up the airlift over a year several bases in Europe were used with hundreds of flights from each from the UK, Germany, Italy, Cyprus and Greece,' Al Jazeera claimed. 'It is this air bridge, together with a vast number of surveillance flights and air-to-air refueling that has sustained Israel's brutal war on Gaza and how to expand its operations into southern Lebanon.' The U.K. MoD said it is not participating in the Israel-Hamas war. 'Our mandate is narrowly defined to focus on securing the release of the hostages only, including British nationals, with the RAF routinely conducting unarmed flights since December 2023 for this sole purpose,' the MoD told us in a statement.

B-21 Raider Fleet Size Under Review	The expected size of the U.S. Air Force's B-21 Raider fleet could change as part of an ongoing force structure review, according to the bomber's manufacturer Northrop Grumman. The company is also expecting to get another B-21 low-rate production contract by the end of the year, which follows steadily progressing ground and flight testing work. Kathy Warden, Northrop Grumman's CEO, talked about the present state of the B-21 program and her company's expectations for the future during a quarterly earnings call earlier today. The Air Force's publicly stated plan has long been to buy at least 100 Raiders, but there have been discussions for years now about the possibility of the service acquiring significantly more of the bombers. 'I think that's exactly what the Air Force is looking at,' Warden said. 'They are undertaking a force structure design review and the Secretary [of the Air Force Frank Kendall] has been open about looking at the various options they have for increasing their force size, and has talked specifically about NGAD, and we know that B-21 is in the mix, as well.' Warden was responding to a question about how any fallout from the Air Force's reassessment of its plans for a new crewed sixth-generation stealth 'fighter' as part of the larger Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative might impact the B-21 and other programs. The NGAD combat jet effort's future is now very uncertain amid a deep re-examination of what the aircraft might be expected to do as a part of efforts to drive down costs, as you can read more about here. Broader concerns about the outlook for U.S. defense budgets in the coming years, as well as increasing costs for other top-priority efforts, especially the ballooning price of the LGM-35A Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile program, have also factored into the NGAD review. Northrop Grumman notably voluntarily withdrew from the competition to develop the NGAD combat jet, at least as a prime contractor, last year. A rendering of various existing advanced Northrop Grumman aircraft designs and future concepts, including a notional crewed stealth combat aircraft at left. Northrop Grumman 'It would be premature for me to suggest where that force structure review will end up,' Warden added during the call today. 'I do think in the coming months, we may get a better indication from the Air Force as to how they're thinking about B-21 quantities in the long run.' The War Zone has reached out to the Air Force for more information. New questions about the Air Force's expected B-21 fleet size had already emerged earlier this year. Gen. David Allvin, the service's Chief of Staff, caused a stir at a Congressional hearing in April when he declined to commit to buying more than 100 Raiders and talked about his service already looking to future capabilities to augment the bombers. A key known requirement for the B-21 already is the ability to operate in a pilot-optional mode. 'It [the B-21] certainly is the future of our bomber force. … 100 is the program of record,' Allvin said at the time. 'I think we’re not going to reach that number until probably the mid-2030s and beyond. And before we commit to that as being the platform beyond that, I think there are other technological advancements that we would see to be able to augment that and have a better mix.' The War Zone has previously explored in detail how the Air Force looking beyond the B-21 now makes good sense. The air combat realities that the entire U.S. military has to contend with continue to rapidly evolve, especially when it comes to future planning around a potential high-end fight, such as one in the Pacific against China. Advances in the uncrewed aviation and artificial and machine learning sectors are particularly significant factors in these broader developments. Photo courtesy of Jonathan Case, Northrop Grumman It is worth noting here that there is the potential that a review of the B-21 force structure plans, especially in relation to what could happen with the NGAD combat jet, might actually lead to an increase in Raider acquisitions. The possibility of B-21s, or a variant or derivative of that design, supporting NGAD-related air dominance missions is something The War Zone and Air Force officials have raised in the past. 'In the short run, we may remain very focused on delivering them optionality, the performance that we are delivering gives them a capability that is in production now that is well below the cost targets for the platform, and we believe that that's the role of industry to get the government options as they think about their force structure,' Northrop Grumman's Warden also said during today's earnings call. Northrop Grumman has delivered at least one of six pre-production B-21s and has begun work on the first low-rate initial production (LRIP) lot of Raiders. The company is expecting to get a contract for the second LRIP lot in the fourth quarter of 2024. 'We have no change to pricing,' Warden said today. 'We are continuing to perform&#8230; in alignment with the plan that we have laid out for the B-21 and I'm very proud of that team. It's quite a remarkable accomplishment.' In January, Northrop Grumman had disclosed a loss of nearly $1.2 billion on the B-21 program and its expectation that it would take a financial hit on each of the first five LRIP lots. 'Macroeconomic disruptions,' which could include higher-than-expected inflation and other broader economic factors, were cited as the cause of the losses. Though the exact current estimated unit cost of the Raider is unknown, Northrop Grumman continues to say it is under the Air Force's target of $550 million in Fiscal Year 2010 dollars, or around $793 million when adjusted for inflation. The first pre-production B-21 landing at Edwards Air Force Base in California after a flight test. USAF 'The B-21 program has also made solid progress in achieving ground and flight testing milestones on the development contract, and is continuing to execute the aircraft production contract in line with our estimates,' Warden added today. Northrop Grumman and the Air Force had already provided a substantial update on B-21 testing activities, including work using two non-flying ground test articles, around the Air & Space Forces Association's main annual conference back in September. Officials at that time highlighted how the tempo of flight testing using the initial pre-production Raider had increased to two flights per week. The Air Force's publicly stated goal remains to begin fielding B-21s operationally before 2030, with Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota slated to be the first base to host combat-coded Raider squadrons. Additional B-21 squadrons are set to be based at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, the current home of the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber fleet, and Dyess Air Force Base in Texas. There are now new questions about exactly what the full B-21 force layout might look like, even as testing and initial production of the bombers are expanding.

Poland’s F-16s Cleared For Major Upgrades	Poland has taken the next step in the modernization of its air force, with U.S. approval given for a major upgrade of its fleet of F-16 fighters. The program will bring the jets to the F-16V standard and also suggests new weapons may be introduced, too. The Viper Midlife Upgrade is announced as Poland awaits F-35s and considers buying F-15EXs, while making significant investments in its armed forces across the board, to meet the threat from Russia. As is typically the case for major U.S. arms sales, the Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) announced the State Department’s approval of the F-16 package for Poland yesterday. Poland’s Viper Midlife Upgrade would be valued at around $7.3 billion. Under the proposed deal, the full fleet of 48 Polish Air Force F-16C/D Block 52+ jets would be upgraded, receiving a considerable boost in capabilities. A Polish Air Force F-16C with conformal fuel tanks (CFTs) fitted. Polish Air Force Polish Armed Forces/Piotr Łysakowski It is important to stress that approved foreign arms sales announced through DSCA are not final and are subject to change, including as a result of negotiations between the country in question and relevant defense contractors. Nevertheless, at the center of the upgrade is the Northrop Grumman AN/APG-83 active Scalable Agile Beam Radars (SABR), an electronically scanned array (AESA) radar which you can read more about in detail here. A Northrop Grumman AN/APG-83 SABR radar installed on an F-16. U.S. Air Force USAF / Bobbi Zapka This will be combined with a new Modular Mission Computer as well as a Next Generation Mission Computer or equivalent. The pilots will be provided with Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing Systems (JHMCS II), an upgraded and improved version of the original JHMCS that Poland already uses. Other avionics include Embedded Global Positioning System (GPS) Inertial Navigation Systems (INS), AN/APX-126/127 Advanced Identification Friend or Foe (AIFF) with combined interrogator/transponder, and AN/ARC-238 radios (or equivalent). In terms of self-protection equipment, the upgraded F-16s would be fitted with either the AN/ALQ-254V(1) Viper Shield or AN/ALQ-257 Integrated Viper Electronic Warfare Suite (IVEWS), which aligns with reports earlier this year that Northrop Grumman and L3Harris were facing off to provide the central electronic warfare component of an expected upgrade package for the Polish jets. Other self-protection gear outlined by the DCSA announcement comprises Passive Airborne Warning System (PAWS-2) missile warning systems and AN/ALE-47 countermeasures dispensers. The offensive weapons outlined in the package are all test and training versions and comprise three AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) captive-carry flight test vehicles, three GBU-53/B Small Diameter Bomb II (SDB II) guided test vehicles, eight SDB II captive-carry reliability trainers, and two GBU-39(T-1)/B Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) guided test vehicles. Notably, neither the GBU-39/B nor the GBU-53/B, the latter of which is also known as the StormBreaker, are currently in the Polish arsenal. There are also two AIM-9X Block II Sidewinder special air training missiles and two AIM-9X captive air training missiles. A U.S. Air Force F-16D carrying a load of StormBreakers during a test. Raytheon F-16D carrying a load of StormBreakers during a test. (Raytheon) With no operational weaponry included so far, these stores will be used for developmental test of the F-16V for Poland. They provide a fairly good indication of some of the munitions that are likely to be procured by the Polish Air Force in the future. The DSCA statement on the approved sale also references MS-110 reconnaissance pods, although the number is not disclosed. Polish F-16s already fly with the dual-band DB-110 tactical reconnaissance pod, the precursor to the current MS-110, which adds a multi-spectral imaging (MSI) capability. 'The F-16 Viper mid-life upgrade will bolster Poland’s air defense and surveillance capabilities, support national security, and strengthen Poland’s defense and contributions to NATO,' the DSCA states. No timelines for Poland’s potential Viper Midlife Upgrade were announced. Upgrading the F-16 — known locally as the Jastrzab, or Hawk — makes a lot of sense for Poland, with the 48 examples (36 single-seat F-16Cs and 12 two-seat F-16Ds) set to be Poland’s most important combat aircraft for some time to come. These fighters currently serve with three squadrons, two of them based in Poznan-Krzesiny and one at Łask. These aircraft are already highly capable and among the most potent F-16s of any NATO operator. A Polish F-16 preparing for a night flight at Trapani Air Base, Italy, during the Trident Juncture 15 exercise. Antonio Valentino/Wikimedia Commons OR9 Antonio VALENTINO_ITA_AF_50th Wing Piacenza The jets can be configured with conformal fuel tanks (CFTs) and are armed with AIM-120C-5/7 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) and AIM-9X Sidewinder that can be fired off-boresight using the JHMCS. Current offensive stores include the AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missile, AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW), and AGM-158A/B Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), as well as Paveway laser-guided bombs, and Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM). The aircraft are fitted with Sniper targeting pods. Once upgraded, Poland’s F-16s will remain highly viable until the F-35s become fully operationally capable and will be able to fight alongside those jets after. Furthermore, as has been pointed out in the past, the F-16V upgrade should also help the Polish Air Force integrate the F-35, with some significant commonality in terms of avionics, especially the radars. The urgency of keeping the Polish fighter force at the top of its game — through new acquisitions and modernization programs — has been driven by the changing security situation in Eastern Europe, especially since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. This has accelerated plans to replace Poland’s Cold War-era fleet of Soviet-made MiG-29 Fulcrum and Su-22 Fitter combat aircraft. A pair of Polish MIG-29s take part in a NATO exercise at Łask Air Base, Poland, in October 2022. Photo by Omar Marques/Getty Images Omar Marques Today, just 14 MiG-29s remain in service, after the transfer of a similar number to Ukraine in 2023, to restock its Fulcrum fleet that has been ravaged during the war with Russia. Poland is expected to retire its last MiG-29s in 2027. Meanwhile, the last of the aging Su-22 Fitter swing-wing ground-attack/strike aircraft are now scheduled for withdrawal next year. The new security situation has also led to Poland considering the possibility of arming its future F-35s with U.S. B61-12 thermonuclear bombs in the future, as you can read about here. Outfitting F-16s with these weapons also remains a possibility, although the stealth fighter offers many more advantages in the nuclear strike role. Poland will start to receive its new fifth-generation fighters soon. The first F-35A from an order for 32 was officially rolled out in August in a ceremony at Lockheed Martin’s Fort Worth, Texas plant. The first pair of F-35s — locally named Husarz, or Hussar — are scheduled to be delivered in December. Poland’s first F-35A was officially rolled out on August 28 in a ceremony at Lockheed Martin’s Fort Worth, Texas plant. Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin There is also the possibility that Poland might further increase its fighter inventory, adding another new type in the shape of the F-15EX, the latest version of the Eagle. Boeing made an announcement about its pitch to sell an unspecified number of F-15EXs to Poland in September last year, as we wrote about at the time. As we noted then, even a relatively small F-15EX buy could be very useful for Poland, providing a platform with some niche capabilities that the F-16 and the F-35 can’t necessarily provide. In particular, the Eagle II offers significantly greater range and payload capacity that could be particularly useful for Poland when it comes to protecting the country’s airspace, where stealth would not necessarily be as critical, and increasing its capacity to conduct standoff strikes against surface targets. The ability to carry future hypersonic weapons could also be attractive as Poland seeks to further develop its long-range strike capabilities. A U.S. Air Force F-15EX armed with 12 AIM-120 AMRAAMs. U.S. Air Force SSgt. Blake Wiles Poland has also recently introduced yet another warplane, the South Korea-made FA-50 light combat aircraft. In July last year, Warsaw signed an agreement with Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) to buy 48 FA-50s, as part of a huge arms transfer from South Korea to Poland. The jets are being rapidly delivered to backfill combat aircraft numbers after the transfer of 14 MiG-29s to Ukraine and the forthcoming retirement of the Su-22. To speed up the deliveries, Poland is receiving the FA-50s in two discrete configurations. The first 12 FA-50s, in Block 10 standard, were delivered to Poland in mid-2023. The next batch of 36 aircraft will be in the more advanced Block 20 configuration, including active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, Sniper targeting pod, Link 16 datalink, and AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles. Deliveries of the Block 20 aircraft are due to begin next year. Recently, there has been some criticism of the FA-50 buy and, especially, the lack of certain weapons for these aircraft.

Photo by Foto Olimpik/NurPhoto via Getty Images NurPhoto NurPhoto In a parliamentary speech last month, Poland’s Deputy Minister of Defense Cezary Tomczyk derided the FA-50s as 'a training-combat aircraft that is for training but not for combat.' The main point of concern is the integration of AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles, which were expected for the Block 20 version, but which KAI now says could take much longer — if it’s even feasible. '[AMRAAM integration] requires U.S. approval,' Chongho Yoon, the vice president of KAI, told Defense24.com. 'A feasibility study is underway; all is to happen in three to four years. Technically this is doable, but other areas need to be addressed. KAI is currently working on such research and the matter is to be clarified in two to three years.' Whether or not the FA-50s eventually receive AMRAAM, they will at least benefit from being compatible with other weapons used by the F-16. Should Poland buy more weapons for its upgraded Vipers, these could also be used to arm the FA-50 fleet. Polish F-16s with Sniper pods on their engine intakes. Photo by RADOSLAW JOZWIAK/AFP via Getty Images RADOSLAW JOZWIAK As well as new combat aircraft, Poland is also investing in its broader air defense architecture, notably receiving U.S. approval to purchase elements of a new airborne early warning system based on an aerostat — a type of uncrewed tethered airship. You can read more about that intriguing project, which has parallels with the canceled American system known as JLENS, in this previous article. While not unexpected, the announcement of the proposed Viper upgrade for Poland is yet more evidence of the country’s efforts to strengthen its air force as it seeks to provide a more effective deterrent to possible Russian aggression as well as a more capable bulwark should Moscow make a move against Poland or another NATO state in the region, something that officials are increasingly concerned about. This military expansion is reflected across the Polish Armed Forces and has been aided by a hike in defense expenditure, with Warsaw now spending 4.23 percent of its GDP on its armed forces, more than double the NATO target of two percent. The All in all, Poland’s increasingly powerful air force reflects the country’s defense-spending spree, as fears of Russian aggression grow in the wake of the all-out invasion of Ukraine. With Poland spending 4.23 percent of its GDP on its armed forces, more than double the NATO target of two percent, the forthcoming F-35 fleet will be one of the most potent — and capable — symbols of the country’s rapid military modernization.

The new package 'will provide Ukraine additional capabilities to meet its most urgent needs, including: munitions for rocket systems and artillery; mortar systems and rounds; armored vehicles; and anti-tank weapons,' the Pentagon said in a statement. This marks the 68th tranche of equipment to be provided from DoD inventories for Ukraine under the PDA program since August 2021. The capabilities in this announcement include: Ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS); 155mm and 105mm artillery ammunition; 60mm, 81mm, and 120mm mortar systems and rounds; Tube-launched, Optically tracked, Wire-guided (TOW) missiles; Javelin and AT-4 anti-armor systems; M113 Armored Personnel Carriers; Satellite communication equipment; Small arms and ammunition; Grenades and training equipment; Demolitions equipment and munitions; Equipment to protect critical national infrastructure; and Spare parts, ancillary equipment, services, training, and transportation.

The UK is donating those funds 'toward the Maritime Capability Coalition and is seeking partners to co-fund delivery of hundreds more maritime drones (aerial and uncrewed boats), as well as surveillance radars to protect the Grain Corridor,' U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s office announced Wednesday. 'And together, the UK and Norway are seeking a further £100 million ($129 million) to co-fund hundreds more.' The donations would boost Ukraine’s drone stocks. As we have frequently reported, its indigenously built sea drones have caused widespread havoc on Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, with attacks on ports in Crimea and ships. They have been so devastating that Russia has moved the bulk of its BSF from Crimea to Novorossysk in Russia. Ukrainian Sea Baby drones were used to attack the Kerch Bridge in July 2023.

The new package 'will provide Ukraine additional capabilities to meet its most urgent needs, including: munitions for rocket systems and artillery; mortar systems and rounds; armored vehicles; and anti-tank weapons,' the Pentagon said in a statement. This marks the 68th tranche of equipment to be provided from DoD inventories for Ukraine under the PDA program since August 2021. The capabilities in this announcement include: Ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS); 155mm and 105mm artillery ammunition; 60mm, 81mm, and 120mm mortar systems and rounds; Tube-launched, Optically tracked, Wire-guided (TOW) missiles; Javelin and AT-4 anti-armor systems; M113 Armored Personnel Carriers; Satellite communication equipment; Small arms and ammunition; Grenades and training equipment; Demolitions equipment and munitions; Equipment to protect critical national infrastructure; and Spare parts, ancillary equipment, services, training, and transportation.

The UK is donating those funds 'toward the Maritime Capability Coalition and is seeking partners to co-fund delivery of hundreds more maritime drones (aerial and uncrewed boats), as well as surveillance radars to protect the Grain Corridor,' U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s office announced Wednesday. 'And together, the UK and Norway are seeking a further £100 million ($129 million) to co-fund hundreds more.' The donations would boost Ukraine’s drone stocks. As we have frequently reported, its indigenously built sea drones have caused widespread havoc on Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, with attacks on ports in Crimea and ships. They have been so devastating that Russia has moved the bulk of its BSF from Crimea to Novorossysk in Russia. Ukrainian Sea Baby drones were used to attack the Kerch Bridge in July 2023.

The funds form Britain’s contribution to a £38 billion ($50 billion) fund announced in June by members of the G7 group of leading economies. 'Defense Secretary John Healey said the new money will help Ukraine bolster its frontline military equipment,' the news outlet reported.

New Ways To Stretch F/A-18 Super Hornet’s Range Sought By Navy	The U.S. Navy is asking for new ideas about how to increase the unrefueled range of its F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighters and EA-18G Growler electronic warfare aircraft. The service axed plans to give its Super Hornets range-extending conformal fuel tanks (CFT) nearly four years ago, citing technical and other issues. The Navy's MQ-25 Stingray tanker drone program has also experienced significant delays, as well as cost growth. Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) put out a contracting notice asking for information about potential 'innovative concepts' for extending the range of its Super Hornet and Growler fleets earlier today. From top to bottom, an F/A-18E, an F/A-18F, and an EA-18G. Boeing 'The intent of this RFI [request for information] is to provide&#8230; initial insight into the existence of such concepts, their potential capability to extend platform range, how the concept could be integrated into naval TACAIR [tactical aircraft], and any considerations with respect to reliability and suitability for carrier-based flight operations,' the notice says. 'It is meant to provide respondents with broad latitude to submit concepts across multiple engineering disciplines that could provide extended range capability.' 'Example areas these concepts may address include, but are NOT limited to, methods to increase lift, reduce drag, increase fuel available, reduce fuel usage on the deck, increase engine performance; and/or adjustments to subsystem integration and/or architecture or advanced flight controls,' it adds. NAVAIR's website puts the F/A-18E/F's maximum combat range at 1,275 nautical miles (2,346 kilometers), but with a loadout of just two AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. Boeing, the Super Hornet's manufacturer, has said in the past that the jet's range is around 1,188 nautical miles (2,200 kilometers) when carrying two AIM-9X Sidewinders, two AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM), two 2,000-pound-class precision-guided bombs, and a 480-gallon drop tank on the centerline station. The EA-18G's combat range when carrying three AN/ALQ-99 jamming pods, two AIM-120s, two radar-busting AGM-88-series missiles, and two 480-gallon drop tanks is over 850 nautical miles (1,574 kilometers), per NAVAIR. An EA-18G carrying three AN/ALQ-99 pods and a pair of drop tanks, as well as an Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation (ACMI) pod under its right wing. USN As already noted, Boeing has developed CFTs for the F/A-18E/F offering greater range and performance over loadouts using traditional draggy drop tanks. The two conformal tanks, designed to be installed on either side of the Super Hornet's spine on top of the jets’ center 'barrel' section, can hold 515 gallons of fuel in total. The company has previously said the tanks could extend the range of Super Hornet loaded with a pair of AIM-9Xs, a pair of AIM-120s, a pair of 2,000-pound precision-guided bombs, and the centerline drop tank, to 1,428 nautical miles (close to 2,645 kilometers). The CFTs could also free up the stations previously taken up by drop tanks for other stores. Boeing The Navy had originally planned to include the CFTs along with other improvements on new-production Block III Super Hornets and older jets brought up to that standard – an upgrade effort that is still underway. There had also been the potential for adding the CFTs to the EA-18Gs down the line. A Navy F/A-18F with conformal fuel tanks (CFT) installed during testing. USN However, in January 2021, the Navy halted work on the CFTs for the Super Hornet citing, in part, still largely unexplained technical hurdles tied in some way to carrier-based operations, as you can read more about here. Cost growth and delays were also a factor. It is certainly possible that the Navy could now revisit the matter of CFTs. At least new-production Block III Super Hornets all still have provisions for the ones Boeing has designed already. New, low-drag drop tanks might be another option. NAVAIR's mention of 'increase engine performance' as another possible avenue to increasing F/A-18E/F and EA-18G range recalls previous discussions about re-engining the jets. An Enhanced Performance Engine (EPE) configuration of the existing General Electric F414s that power Super Hornets and Growlers now has been proposed in the past. The F414-EPE was projected to offer a 20 percent increase in thrust (which could translate to greater range) and a one percent reduction in fuel burn rate. A look at the specifications of the previously proposed F414-EPE engine. General Electric How cost-effective and otherwise viable any other potential changes to the jet's physical structures, including the placement of subsystems, another potential range-extending avenue NAVAIR mentioned in its contracting notice today, might be is unclear. The Navy's existing Super Hornets have already been going through costly and time-consuming life-extension and upgrade programs in recent years. New-production jets are rolling off a line Boeing plans to shutter completely in 2027. At the same time, relatively small individual efficiency gains from more modest changes, such as vortex generators and drag-reducing techniques, coupled with improved computer-controlled flight systems and new tactics, techniques, and procedures, could all up when it comes to fuel economy and range. What is clear is that the Navy still has a significant interest in finding on-aircraft ways to extend the range of its F/A-18E/Fs and EA-18Gs. This comes amid an expanding air defense and anti-ship threat ecosystem that presents growing challenges to carrier-based aircraft and the ships in carrier strike groups. China's ever-more-capable arsenal of air-to-air, surface-to-air, and anti-ship missiles, as well as other anti-access and area-denial capabilities, is of particular concern to the U.S. military. This reality can only contribute to lengthening distances between where carriers will have to launch their aircraft to reduce vulnerability and where those planes are expected to operate. We have already seen this translate to significant aviation-related developments within the Navy, particularly the development and now fielding on at least a limited level of the AIM-174B air-launched derivative of the multi-purpose Standard Missile-6 (SM-6), which you can read more about here. F/A-18E/Fs are currently the only known launch platform for the notably large, heavy, and draggy AIM-174Bs, underscoring the value of new range-extending option, especially as alternatives to traditional drop tanks. Super Hornets are also set to be at least the initial launch platform for the Navy's Hypersonic Air-Launched Offensive Anti-Surface Warfare (HALO) hypersonic anti-ship cruise missile, another weapon that is expected to be relatively large. Heavier stores loadouts translate to increased fuel burn, as well as less margin for carrier-based aircraft to bring them back to the ship. There is also the matter of the Navy's work to introduce new infrared search and track (IRST) sensors in modified centerline drop tanks with reduced fuel capacity. IRSTs are an increasingly important capability for tactical jet fleets across the U.S. military. The Navy is also in the process of fielding a new family of next-generation electronic warfare pods for the EA-18G. GAO has reported in the past that Raytheon's ALQ-249(V)1 Next Generation Jammer-Mid Band (NGJ-MB) pods produce more drag than the existing AN/ALQ-99s and reduce range as a result. Weight and drag issues may also have contributed to the Navy's decision to choose an entirely separate design for the NGJ-Low Band (NGJ-LB) pod from L3Harris and Northrop Grumman rather than an NGJ-MB-derived proposal from Raytheon. A VAQ-133 Growler assigned to the USS Abraham Lincoln with AN/ALQ-249(V)1 Next Generation Jammer-Mid Band (NGJ-MB) pods under its wings. USN When it comes to extending the reach of its carrier air wings, the Navy is also still pursuing a fleet of uncrewed MQ-25 Stingray tankers, another Boeing product, to help increase the range of its carrier-based tactical jets. Core requirements for the Stingrays include the ability to offload at least 14,000 pounds of fuel (and potentially up to 16,000 pounds) up to 500 nautical miles (926 kilometers) away from the carrier. The MQ-25s will also have a secondary intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capability, and could take on other missions, including stand-off strike, in the future. At the same time, a series of delays have pushed back the timeline for the very first of the MQ-25s to begin entering operational service until at least 2026. Cost growth on the MQ-25 program also continues to be a major concern. As of August 2023, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), a Congressional watchdog, estimated the total Stingray program cost to be close to $15 billion, including the planned purchase of 76 drones. Past GAO estimates that also include associated construction work at various bases have put the program's expected price tag at around $16.5 billion. Just today, Boeing announced a $2 billion loss across various programs in its defense portfolio, including the MQ-25, during the third quarter of 2024. This was part of a nearly $6.2 billion loss for the entire company in the third quarter, adding to billions of dollars of already reported financial losses this year. Boeing's earnings report&#8230;$6.17b net loss in 3Q, $7.98b so far in FY. Beyond the $2b charges on KC-46, VC-25, T-7, MQ-25 and commercial crew, there's 'unfavorable performance on other programs.'&mdash; Brian Everstine (@beverstine) October 23, 2024 The aforementioned threat ecosystem means that fuel-hungry U.S. tactical jets will have to contend with how the evolving battlespace will limit access to traditional aerial refueling support, the capacity of which is expected to be strained by operational demands to begin with. This has put renewed emphasis on smaller tankers, crewed or uncrewed, such as C-130-based types, which could make use of a wider array of operating locations, as well as more novel capabilities. The Navy's carrier air wings are in an important transition period more broadly. The service plans to add a new F/A-XX sixth-generation crewed stealth combat jet and Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) loyal wingman-type drones to its carrier-based fleets in the coming years. The Navy has a now long-standing goal to have carrier air wings be sixty percent uncrewed in the future. Drones typically have greater range than their crewed tactical jet counterparts, and increasing the ratio of uncrewed platforms could also help extend the reach of carrier air wings by hundreds of miles. At the same time, Super Hornets and Growlers are expected to continue being workhorses of the Navy's carrier air wings for the foreseeable future. As such, finding ways to extend their reach to expand their operational flexibility and reduce vulnerability clearly remains of great interest, if not critical importance.

North Korean Troops In Russia Finally Confirmed By NATO, U.S.	After a week of saying they had no evidence of North Korean troops in Russia, officials at the White House, Pentagon and NATO have now gone on the record to say Pyongyang has indeed deployed a significant number of soldiers. 'We know that thousands of DPRK troops are in Russia to be trained,' a senior Biden administration official told The War Zone Wednesday morning. 'We don’t know what their mission will be or if they’ll go on to fight in Ukraine. But we do know that if they do this, it signals President Putin’s growing desperation in his war against Ukraine. Russia is suffering extraordinary casualties on the battlefield every day. If Russia needs to turn to DPRK for manpower, that’s a sign of desperation – not strength – on the part of the Kremlin.' Traveling with reporters in Rome, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin offered similar insights. 'Our analysts … continue to look at this,' he said, according to The Washington Post. 'Now we are seeing evidence that there are North Korean troops that have gone to … Russia.' Well that's a new one.

'What exactly they’re doing is left to be seen. But, yes, there is evidence that there are DPRK troops in Russia,' he added, using the abbreviation for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Asked about the intent of North Korea’s deployment, Austin said the United States is still trying to determine that. 'If they’re co-belligerents, if their intention is to participate in this war on Russia’s behalf, that is a very, very serious issue,' he said. 'It will have impacts, not only in Europe. It will also impact things in the Indo-Pacific as well.' In Brussels, NATO spokesperson Farah Dakhlallah also noted the presence of North Korean troops in Russia. 'Allies have confirmed evidence of a DPRK deployment to Russia,' she said, according to a tweet from Voice of America national security correspondent Jeff Selden. 'If these troops are destined to fight in Ukraine, it would ​ mark a significant escalation in North Korea's support for Russia's illegal war and yet another sign of Russia’s significant losses on the front line.' NATO is 'actively consulting within the alliance on this matter,' Dakhlallah added. 'The North Atlantic Council will receive a briefing from the ROK (South Korea) and further discuss this matter soon.'

Yesterday, Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, head of GUR, told us that the first of those troops were expected to be on the battlefield in Kursk today. We have asked him for an update on that claim and will report any pertinent details he provides. While Budanov told us that there are nearly 12,000 North Korean troops in Russia, South Korean intelligence officials on Wednesday said there are about 3,000 at the moment with a total of 10,000 expected, the country’s Yonhap News Agency reported Wednesday. About 1,500 are elite special operations forces. 'After the first batch arrived in Russia from Oct. 8-13, an additional 1,500 soldiers have been sent there,' Rep. Park Sun-won of the main opposition Democratic Party told reporters, citing a report by National Intelligence Service (NIS) Director Cho Tae-yong. The troops have yet to arrive at the front and are instead stationed at military facilities in Russia where they are adjusting to their new circumstances, the publication reported. Last week we reported that the NIS released its assessment of the situation, which included satellite images purporting to show North Korean troops training in Russia's far east. However, the number of troops and if they are even North Korean cannot be confirmed by the satellite imagery provided. You can see one of those images below. A military facility in Ussuriisk, Primorsky Krai that South Korea’s spy agency says shows an estimated 400 North Korean personnel gathered on a parade ground. (NIS) 'The soldiers are undergoing special training on how to use military equipment and fly unmanned aerial vehicles, among other things,' Yonhap stated. A North Korean soldier receives around US $2,000 monthly for the service to Russia, NIS said. 'Russian instructors believe that North Korean soldiers are fit both physically and mentally, but they lack the understanding of modern warfare, such as drone attacks,' Yonhap reported. '‘They also expect multiple casualties among the North Koreans,’ the NIS was quoted as saying by the lawmaker.' At least six of Pyongyang’s forces, as we previously noted, have already been killed in Ukraine. All this comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin submitted a draft law to the Russian State Duma recently seeking ratification of a strategic partnership between Moscow and Pyongyang, hammered out in June. It calls for each side to provide military assistance to each other in the event of war. The exchange is not out of the goodness of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un’s heart. Moscow is providing him with nuclear weapons technology in return, Budanov told The Economist. 'Budanov describes the secret provisions of the agreement as a quid pro quo,' the publication reported. 'Russian hard cash and know-how in return for Korean men and missiles. Russia is helping North Korea circumvent sanctions and ‘strengthen’ its nuclear capabilities.' In particular, Budanov said Russia 'is transferring some technologies for low-yield tactical nuclear weapons and submarine missile-launch systems.' However, The Economist noted, 'there is no independent corroboration of this alarming claim.' More serious than troops: 'According to Mr Budanov, [North Korean] shipments that began as long ago as in late 2022 have reached 2.8m shells a year, just 100,000 short of Russia’s own annual production at 2.9m shells.' Shashank Joshi (@shashj) October 23, 2024 Officials at the White House, Pentagon and NATO have yet to say how they would respond if North Korean troops engage on a large scale in battles with Ukrainian forces. As we noted yesterday, U.S. officials, East Asian diplomats and congressional aides are saying there is not much the U.S. to stop North Korea from sending troops to Russia. 'They concede that Washington has made little to no progress in slowing North Korea’s rogue nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, and if it can’t do that, it can only do so much to halt North Korean troop deployments to Russia, too,' those sources told Politico. The presence of even 12,000 North Korean troops may not drastically alter the outcome of the fight even if about 1,500 of them are said to be elite special operations forces. However, with plenty more at his disposal, Kim could eventually increase the supply of troops to Russia dramatically.

EP-3E Aries II Spy Plane That Collided With Chinese Fighter Is Go...	The spy plane at the center of one of the most notorious post-Cold War air incidents, a U.S. Navy EP-3E Aries II, has arrived at the Pima Air & Space Museum in Tucson, Arizona, for future public display. The EP-3E’s journey to get to the museum has been a long one, starting with the dramatic collision with a Chinese fighter in the so-called Hainan Island incident in 2001. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Pima Air & Space Museum (@pimaair) EP-3E serial number 156511 was the aircraft involved in the collision. Confirmed by an Instagram post from the Pima Air & Space Museum, it arrived at the location yesterday, having been towed there from the boneyard at the nearby 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) in Tucson. The museum states that the Aries II is not yet ready for public display, but it will be a truly unique exhibit once that happens. EP-3E Aries II serial number 156511 is towed to the Pima Air &#038; Space Museum yesterday. Pima Air &#038; Space Museum Pima Air &#038; Space Museum Even without the turbulent history of this particular airframe, the EP-3E — one of America’s most sensitive intelligence-gathering assets — is already an impressively rare aircraft to see in the flesh. A derivative of the P-3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft, the EP-3E has a critical important intelligence-gathering role and is optimized for the maritime/littoral domain. The aircraft is equipped to gather real-time tactical signals intelligence, including intercepting communications and locating and classifying emitters, including those related to integrated air defense systems. On April 1, 2001, serial number 156511 was flying a routine reconnaissance mission over the South China Sea out of Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, Japan. As well as six flight crew, it carried a reconnaissance crew of 18, from the Navy, Marines, and Air Force. It was assigned to Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron One (VQ-1), known as the 'World Watchers.' The cabin of EP-3E Aries II serial number 156511 as it appears now. Pima Air &#038; Space Museum Tasked with monitoring Chinese communications as well radio-frequency signals emitted by radars and weapon systems, the EP-3E was flying at 22,500 feet off Hong Kong’s coast in international airspace, when the crew was alerted to the fact that interceptors had been launched from Lingshui air base on Hainan Island, China. Within minutes, a pair of People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) J-8D Finback interceptors appeared about a mile away. This was the signal for the EP-3E crew to turn around from its mission and prepare to head back to base. The Chinese J-8 flown by Wang Wei on April 1, 2001, flies close to another U.S. Navy aircraft on a different occasion. U.S. Navy Next, however, one of the J-8s approached from the rear left and took up station just 10 feet away from the EP-3E’s wing. The Chinese pilot, Wang Wei, saluted the American crew, then dropped back 100 feet. Assigned to the 9th Naval Division, Wei was already well known to U.S. reconnaissance crews, on account of his aggressive approaches to spy planes. This kind of behavior included buzzing at high speed as well as cutting in front of and across the path of the reconnaissance aircraft — also known as a ‘headbutting’ maneuver. '[Wei] was extra crazy. He would get so close to the plane that you could literally jump from one wingtip to another wingtip,' one of the EP-3E crew members later told The Intercept. On one previous occasion, Wang had got close enough to show a piece of paper with his email address to the U.S. crew, who were able to photograph it. A U.S. Navy EP-3E Aries II spy plane. U.S. Navy Despite complaints made to Beijing, these kinds of intercepts had continued, China claiming it was well within its right to defend what it saw as its sovereign airspace. On this occasion, Wei approached the EP-3E for a second time, coming within five feet of the spy plane, mouthed something to the crew, and then fell back again. On his third approach, Wei got too close to the EP-3E. Hit jet was apparently sucked into the slipstream and was sliced in two by one of the propellers. He reportedly ejected but was killed. As the Chinese fighter was torn in half, debris impacted the EP-3E, cutting through the fuselage and damaging the radome, two of the propellers, and an engine. The EP-3E rolled inverted as the crew battled with rapid depressurization. It then dropped like a stone some 14,000 feet, vibrating violently the whole time. The EP-3E pilot, Lt. Shane Osborn, wrestled with the controls and ordered the crew to prepare to bail out. Osborn considered putting the aircraft down in the sea but then reconsidered, deciding on a recovery at Lingshui air base — around 20 minutes away. With no working flaps, the aircraft too heavy, and also falling apart, this seemed like the only option. The flight deck of the EP-3E involved in the Hainan Incident, as it appears now. Pima Air &#038; Space Museum Amid the chaos, the crew made frantic attempts to destroy as much of the highly sensitive equipment and materials on board the spy plane as they could. Unfortunately, only one member of the crew had ever taken part in an inflight emergency destruction drill, so there was little understanding as to what needed to be done to keep secrets out of Chinese hands. An emergency ax was available but proved to be too blunt to do real damage to equipment and there was no shredder, so documents had to be torn up by hand. Cassette tapes full of intercepted data were unspooled by hand. 'I was bashing in computer screens. People were ripping wires out of the wall,' the same crew member told The Intercept. 'By the time we landed, the plane was in total disrepair. We had screwed up the inside of that plane as much as we could.'

Although the EP-3E hadn’t been upgraded to the latest standard, it was still an intelligence windfall for the Chinese. The United States later assessed that it was 'highly probable' that China had obtained classified information from the aircraft. A total of 16 cryptographic keys, other codebooks and laptops, and a computer used for signals intelligence processing, were all still intact. Tuners and processors for signals collection equipment were also mainly undamaged, as were cryptographic voice and data devices for communication and data transfer between the EP-3E and Kadena. On arrival at Lingshui, the EP-3E was met by Chinese military trucks, which guided it to the end of the runway where soldiers surrounded it.

U.S. Air Force The crew were held for 11 days before being released and were regularly interrogated. Meanwhile, the United States secured the return of the EP-3E, which China said had to be dismantled first. This was done with the help of Lockheed Martin technicians. The spy plane was then flown back to the Marietta, Georgia, aboard two Antonov An-124 transports. The spy plane was reassembled and repaired, adding parts from an NP-3D and the wings of a retired P-3B. It made its first flight after the rebuild on November 15, 2002, and then underwent maintenance and modernization with L3 in Waco, Texas, before being returned to service. It was still active as of September 2020, when it was photographed over the East China Sea, and was reportedly still in service as of April this year. Lt.

So far, there has not been another incident as serious as that of April 1, 2001, but there have been close calls. In October of last year, the Pentagon accused the pilot of a Chinese J-11 fighter of conducting an 'unsafe intercept' of a .S. Air Force B-52H Stratofortress bomber over the highly contested South China Sea. You can read more about that incident here. Earlier the same month, the Department of Defense released a collection of declassified images and videos that it says provide evidence of 'a dangerous pattern of coercive and risky operational behavior by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) against U.S. aircraft operating lawfully in international airspace in the East and South China Sea.' The Pentagon said that there were more than 180 such interactions between the fall of 2021 and October 2023. In one of those incidents, in May 2023, a J-16 fighter 'flew directly in front of the nose' of a U.S. Air Force RC-135 surveillance aircraft, forcing it to fly through its wake turbulence — an action known as ‘headbutting’ or ‘thumping.’ Other examples include a simulated attack on a U.S. Navy task group and a close-proximity intercept of another RC-135 by a J-11 — as seen in the video below — both in December 2022. More worrying was the incident in June 2022, when a Royal Australian Air Force P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft was reportedly damaged by countermeasures launched by a Chinese J-16, once again over the South China Sea. As the Hainan Island demonstrates, the stakes have long been very high in these interactions over the South China Sea, especially since Beijing claims the vast majority of these waters as its own. As of today, the EP-3E remains very much still involved in intelligence-gathering missions here and around other global hotspots. At one point, it seemed likely the last of these spy planes would cease operations by September 30, 2024, with the deactivation of VP-1 scheduled to follow in March 2025. However, operational demands have postponed this for the time being. Ultimately, however, the EP-3E’s days are now numbered with the MQ-4C Triton drone steadily replacing it. A U.S. Navy MQ-4C Triton. U.S. Navy Under the Admiral's ambitious plan, everything will feed into a deconflicted and refined common battlespace picture, from high-end ISR assets like this MQ-4C Triton to a swarm of unmanned surface vessels to space-based sensing and even data collected by sensors that are forward-deployed by small ground units. The distributed nature of battlefield data collection will be critical to winning a future fight, but parsing and fuzing all of it and transferring it around a vast battlefield will be major hurdles. (USN) While the events of April 1, 2001, could have ended much worse for the crew of the EP-3E, it’s highly appropriate that such a historic aircraft be preserved for public view. Not only does it stand testimony to the particular events of that day, but it also serves as a reminder of the constant risk that aerial reconnaissance crews are exposed to on missions of this kind.

German P-8s To Fly From U.K. To Help Counter Russian Submarine Th...	Under a major new defense agreement, the United Kingdom and Germany will work together on a raft of programs including new drones, missile defenses, and deep-strike weapons, as well as the periodic deployment of the German Navy’s P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft to a base in Scotland. The Trinity House Agreement will also see significant cooperation on the industrial level, including artillery and armored vehicles. Taken together, the agreement is squarely aimed at better equipping the two countries to deter and defend against Russian belligerence in Europe. NEWS: Today, the United Kingdom and Germany will sign a landmark agreement that will bring our two nations’ Armed Forces closer together than ever. What this deal will deliver &mdash; Ministry of Defence (@DefenceHQ) October 23, 2024 The first-of-its-kind agreement was signed in London today by U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey and his German counterpart Boris Pistorius. 'The signing of the Trinity House Agreement marks a fundamental shift in the U.K.’s relations with Germany and for European security,' the U.K. government said in a statement. 'This agreement between Europe’s two biggest defense spenders will strengthen national security and economic growth in the face of growing Russian aggression and increasing threats.' Anti-submarine warfare Surprisingly, in the United Kingdom, the most attention has so far been devoted to the agreement’s plan for German aircraft to operate from Scotland. Possibly starting as early as next year, the German Navy’s P-8 maritime patrol aircraft will 'periodically operate' out of RAF Lossiemouth, supporting the resident U.K. Royal Air Force Poseidon fleet of nine aircraft. Germany has eight P-8s on order. A U.K. Royal Air Force P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft, seen here flying over the coast of Scotland. Crown Copyright Cpl Adam Fletcher The Times of London described the P-8s as 'German spy aircraft,' although these are multi-mission platforms that are primarily tasked with protecting the Baltic Sea and the North Atlantic against potential Russian aggression and tracking Russian submarine activity, which has been a growing area of concern for some time now. Responding to some of the more hyperbolic reports about the deployment, RAF Lossiemouth posted the following meme on X: pic.twitter.com/kKqd01kVnW&mdash; RAF Lossiemouth (@RAFLossiemouth) October 23, 2024 Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, the head of the U.K. Armed Forces, warned last year of a 'phenomenal increase in Russian submarine and underwater activity' over the past two decades. A reference in the statement from the U.K. government to 'Sting Ray torpedoes procurement' also suggests that, in the future, the German P-8s might also be armed with these British-made anti-submarine weapons. The United Kingdom announced last year that it would arm its P-8s with the Sting Ray alongside the continued use of the U.S.-made Mk 54 torpedo. A Stingray Training Variant Torpedo is fired from Type 23 frigate HMS Westminster during an exercise. Crown Copyright LA(Phot) Dan Rosenbaum Previously, the United Kingdom and Norway discussed plans to cooperate on P-8 operations, and adding Germany to this group would provide a further boost to NATO’s ability to effectively patrol the North Atlantic, including the strategically vital Greenland, Iceland, United Kingdom Gap, better known as the GIUK Gap. This is a critical bottleneck that is closely monitored. If Russian submarines can sneak through undetected, they have a much better chance of disappearing into the Atlantic without being traced. During a full-blown conflict, this would likely include wreaking havoc on NATO shipping and naval flotillas and executing pinpoint attacks on key land targets. Dating from the Cold War but still relevant today, a map of the GIUK Gap. CIA.gov Given the two countries’ histories, having German aircraft based in the United Kingdom might be eye-catching, but it may well not be the most significant part of the agreement. Artillery and armor On the industrial side, a new artillery gun barrel factory will be set up in the United Kingdom, producing large-caliber barrels on behalf of the German Rheinmetall concern. This is a major development for the United Kingdom, which has not built artillery gun barrels for around 20 years. Sheffield Forgemasters, which will build the gun barrels in the United Kingdom, confirmed that these would be for U.K. defense contracts and export orders. Reports suggest that the barrels to be manufactured will be for the British Army’s forthcoming Challenger 3 main battle tank, which is armed with a new 120mm L55A1 smoothbore cannon, and the Boxer RCH 155, a wheeled self-propelled howitzer developed in Germany and armed with a 155mm gun, which has been selected for the U.K. Mobile Fires Platform program. Rheinmetall making barrels for Challenger 3 and Boxer RCH155 in the UK is the best possible news for our national property agenda, strategic resilience, and increasing UK content for locally produced military equipment. All credit to @jcartlidgemp for being the architect of this…&mdash; Nicholas Drummond (@nicholadrummond) October 23, 2024 Manufacturing of artillery and related ammunition across Europe had been at a very low ebb until Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine brought into sharp focus the urgent need to expand this kind of production capability. A Boxer RCH 155 self-propelled howitzer. Crown Copyright Jack Eckersley Meanwhile, the agreement also includes a long-term commitment to manufacturing Boxer armored vehicles in the United Kingdom. In 2019, the British Army ordered 523 Boxer vehicles in four build configurations, covering 11 different roles, and a follow-on order for 100 of these vehicles was placed later. The Boxer is also used by Germany and has been exported to Australia, Lithuania, and the Netherlands. Long-range strike More intriguing yet is the agreement’s commitment to the joint development of a host of novel weapons and capabilities, covering air, land, sea, space, and cyber domains. The two countries will work together to 'rapidly develop' new extended deep strike weapons. No more details were provided, but the weapon or weapons will be expected to fly further and attack targets with greater precision than the Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missile used by the U.K. Royal Air Force and others. A Storm Shadow missile under the wing of a U.K. Royal Air Force Typhoon fighter. Crown Copyright Crown Copyright Previous reports suggested that the United Kingdom was looking at a strike weapon that would have a range of about 2,000 miles, which would allow it to reach Moscow after a launch from eastern Germany. The weapon was said to be a deterrent to Russian tactical nuclear missiles, which are being fielded in increasingly advanced and long-reaching forms, including in Kaliningrad, the Russian exclave on the Baltic Sea. This is an extension of the agreement from the NATO Defense Ministers meeting in Brussels last week. On the sidelines of that meeting, the United Kingdom announced it was joining the European Long-Range Strike Approach (ELSA) initiative, a French-led effort that involves Germany, Poland, and Italy. Previous announcements state that ELSA envisages a missile with a range of between 1,000 and 2,000 kilometers (621 and 1,243 miles) — significantly less than what is reportedly now proposed for the U.K.-German program — and that it should be in service by the 2030s. The UK has agreed to take part in the European Long-range Strike Approach (ELSA). Not unexpected given earlier signals from German-UK meetings in July. Helpfully though the UK MOD press release provides a planned in-service entry date ‘by the 2030s’. pic.twitter.com/aSD0nuYVKk&mdash; Timothy Wright (@Wright_T_J) October 17, 2024 The United States and Germany have also announced that U.S. long-range missiles will be temporarily stationed in Germany starting in 2026, including the SM-6 multi-purpose missile and Tomahawk cruise missile as well as 'developmental hypersonic weapons.' Missile defense Long-range strike is very much an area of interest in Europe right now, as is air defense, especially against missile threats. The Anglo-German agreement includes a pledge to work jointly with undisclosed partners to integrate air defense systems 'to better protect European airspace against the threat of long-range missiles.' The joint air defense efforts may well end up building upon the European Sky Shield Initiative (ESSI), an agreement signed in 2022 by defense ministers from 14 NATO countries and Finland (now also an alliance member). Spearheaded by Germany and also including the United Kingdom, ESSI plans to form a common air defense procurement and deployment alliance, as you can read about here. The specific reference today to 'the threat of long-range missiles' is interesting, although it’s unclear if these are ballistic missiles — of the kind that Germany’s Arrow 3 procurement aims to counter — or cruise missiles, or both. Drone programs Although details are scarce, the agreement references different drone programs that the United Kingdom and Germany will pursue together. One of these involves new uncrewed air systems 'that could operate alongside our fighter jets, as well as drones that can be used by other military force[s].' Concepts for drones that can operate collaboratively with crewed fighters have already been gaining traction in Europe. In Germany, Airbus unveiled its fighter-like stealthy Wingman uncrewed concept aircraft this summer. This is also intended to fly collaborative missions alongside crewed fighters and is being pitched as a low-cost solution — with a price tag equivalent to one-third that of a modern crewed fighter — that can be brought into production and fielded rapidly. The Airbus Wingman concept aircraft broke cover this summer when it was formally unveiled at the ILA Berlin aerospace show. Thomas Newdick Thomas Newdick Airbus has said that the Luftwaffe or German Air Force has 'expressed a clear need' for a drone in this class and it might also feed into any related collaboration between the United Kingdom and Germany. The U.K. Royal Air Force has its own drone initiative known as the Lightweight Affordable Novel Combat Aircraft (LANCA) program, which is looking into a range of future kinds of drones. At one stage, this included Project Mosquito, which planned to test a ‘loyal wingman’-type drone capable of working together semi-autonomously with manned aircraft, but this was canceled in 2022. More recently, British attention has turned to drones that combine high performance with a low enough cost that commanders will consider them 'disposable' — meaning they are willing to sacrifice them in contested environments. One such concept is the Jackdaw, proposed by QinetiQ, the U.K. defense technology company, which was announced last year. It envisages a drone able to fly autonomously alongside crewed aircraft, as well as operate in swarms. A screencap from a video depicts multiple Jackdaw drones taking off from mobile launchers. QinetiQ Clearly, there are common interests between the two countries in this space, and with programs still in their infancy, collaboration could well help push these efforts forward. In the naval domain, the two countries will explore and develop new maritime uncrewed air system capabilities. This may involve Proteus, the helicopter drone developed by Leonardo in the United Kingdom under the Rotary Wing Uncrewed Air System (RWUAS) Technology Demonstration Program (TDP), or RWUAS CCD Phase 3 TDP. Plans call for a Proteus flying demonstrator to take to the air next year and a production version is planned to provide anti-submarine warfare support as part of the Royal Navy’s Future Maritime Aviation Force (FMAF). A rotary-wing drone may well be of interest to Germany, too. The German Navy planned to buy Swedish-made UMS Skeldar V-200 helicopter drones, for use on its Braunschweig class corvettes, but the project was canceled since the drones reportedly failed to meet requirements. Three of the K130 Braunschweig class corvettes in the Baltic Sea, during an exercise in May 2023. Bundeswehr/Nico Theska There is also mention of 'kickstarting collaboration of land-based drones,' suggesting collaboration on uncrewed ground vehicles. Military cooperation On a military level, the agreement lays out new cooperation to strengthen NATO’s eastern flank, which will see the armed forces of the United Kingdom and Germany 'training and exercising more together, using the front as a catalyst for developing new ways of fighting.' In the North Sea, meanwhile, in addition to the P-8 cooperation, the United Kingdom and Germany aim to work together to protect critical underwater infrastructure, specifically the vital cables and gas pipelines that run along the seabed. 'This includes exploring new offboard undersea surveillance capabilities to improve detection of adversary activity,' the U.K. government says. Admiral Radakin previously raised worries over the security of undersea cables and there have been a number of incidents involving sabotage or apparent sabotage to this critical infrastructure, with the finger of blame more often than not pointed at the Kremlin. Ukraine The one reference in the agreement that relates to the support of Ukraine in its war with Russia involves 'new joint work to enable German Sea King helicopters to be armed with modern missile systems as well as work on capability coalitions.' Eastern Ukraine, a pair of British-supplied Westland Sea King HU.5 helicopters in Ukrainian Naval Aviation service operate from a forward airstrip. pic.twitter.com/s6DnBwmSxN&mdash; OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) July 8, 2024 This suggests that the six Sea King helicopters being donated by Germany to Ukraine will first be armed with some kind of offensive missile capability, with that work perhaps being carried out in the United Kingdom, or at least with British support. German Navy Sea Kings were previously armed with Sea Skua anti-ship missiles, but these weapons were withdrawn long before the helicopters were retired in August of this year. The United Kingdom was the original manufacturer of those helicopters, and it has already provided surplus Sea Kings to Ukraine (although not, as far as is known, armed with missile systems). Overall, while details about the specifics of the program included in the agreement are still scarce, the Trinity House Agreement is a significant development. On the one hand, it brings military and industrial cooperation between the United Kingdom and Germany to a new level. More broadly, it demonstrates the two countries’ willingness to increase defense capabilities within NATO, with the specific aim of facing off the threat from Russia. German and British soldiers during a joint operation at the Neman River during the Saber Strike 2018 military exercises in Zapyskis, Lithuania. Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images Sean Gallup 'We must not take security in Europe for granted,' German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said. 'Russia is waging war against Ukraine, it is increasing its weapons production immensely and has repeatedly launched hybrid attacks on our partners in Eastern Europe.' Pistorius also stated that the various cooperation projects outlined in the agreement are 'open to other partners.' Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has highlighted critical capability gaps in NATO in Europe, as well as shone a light on the potential vulnerability of the alliance’s eastern flank to Russian aggression. With that in mind, today’s agreement is a clear signal that the United Kingdom and Germany see military cooperation as a prerequisite for strengthening NATO in Europe.

The Existence Of Israel’s Secret Stealth Drone Should Come As No ...	The existence of a secret Israeli drone, referred to as RA-01 and used for covert missions, has emerged from an unauthorized disclosure of U.S. intelligence documents which have now been posted all over social media. Israel's possession of at least a pocket fleet of long-range stealth drones capable of gathering intelligence and possibly conducting strikes is extremely logical to the point of it being a bit odd if they never pursued such a capability. Israel is home to an extensive and often pioneering uncrewed aviation industry and drones of this kind would be very well suited to supporting the country's ongoing stand-off with Iran. During a major Israeli operation to strike targets in that country, they would likely play an indispensable role, as well. Mention of RA-01 is found in classified documents from the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), the authenticity of which U.S. officials have not disputed and that first emerged online last week via a pro-Iran channel on the Telegram social network. An investigation into whether this unapproved release was the product of a hack or a leak is ongoing. The documents could still be disinformation or feature inaccurate info by design, so we cannot indepedently confirm their authenticity, but at this time, there is no indication that they are not legitimate and there are many indications that they are. it seems that CNN is considering some leaked documents about Israeli preparation to attack Iran as authentic for me is that apart from the 'RA-01' drone a ALBM named 'Golden Horizon' is mentioned.The ALBM 'Rocks' was known for some time pic.twitter.com/kovQqDU5W5&mdash; ben-reuter (@benreuter_IMINT) October 20, 2024 The NGA documents center on observations from October 15-16 of an Israeli Air Force (IAF) large force exercise, which is viewed as part of preparations for retaliation primarily for Iran's ballistic missile barrage at the beginning of this month. In addition to talk about RA-01, there is a discussion about Israel's air-launched ballistic missile capabilities, including Rocks and the previously undisclosed Golden Horizon, which have been employed in previous Israeli retaliatory strikes on Iran, as you can read more about here. There is also talk of Israel's nuclear arsenal, which the country has never publicly acknowledged, and that NGA does not expect to be used in any near-term operations against Iran, as well. When it comes to the RA-01, no details are provided about its design or capabilities, or the size of the fleet, in the NGA documents. What significance the RA-01 nomenclature might have is unknown. 'RA' could imply a reconnaissance and attack capability. Its basic structure is also in line with alpha-numeric designations Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI) has used for drone designs in the past. The designation could be one the U.S. Intelligence Community uses internally to refer to this platform and that does not reflect in any way what the Israelis call it, as well. One of the NGA documents also refers to the Rocks air-launched ballistic missile as the IS02, which could also be another internal U.S. designation. The only known picture of the Rocks air-launched ballistic missile, under the wing of an IAF F-16I wearing a rare gray scheme. IAF NGA's report also does not say any RA-01s were actually observed, just that there were signs that they were operating during the period in question from a restricted area at Ramon Airbase in the Negev desert in southern Israel. Ramon, which was among the targets of Iran's missile and drone attacks on Israel back in April, primarily hosts F-16I Sufa fighters and AH-64 attack helicopters, but has also been home to various secretive and specialized units over the years. Experts and observers have already identified a pair of secluded fence-off areas at the northeastern end of Ramon with shared direct access to one of the base's two runways, which could house the RA-01s. Now that the authenticity of these documents has been confirmed, there’s a critical detail that demands attention:'The Israeli Air Force (IAF) continued covert UAV operations from 15 through 16 October. According to imagery analysis, Israel’s covert UAVs enable long-range,… pic.twitter.com/ycgSFHOuzg&mdash; Clash Report (@clashreport) October 20, 2024 Work on this segregated area of the base dates back to at least the 2007-2008 timeframe from what can seen in available satellite imagery. A significant redevelopment and expansion of this section, including the construction of an entirely new taxiway, more hangars, and other facilities, occurred in the mid-2010s. A satellite image of the segregated area of Ramon Airbase taken in 2010, which offers a good view of its original layout. Google Earth Another satellite image taken in August 2023 showing the revamped and expanded look of the segregated area at Ramon Airbase, which is largely as it still appears today. Google Earth A general look at Ramon Airbase in Israel in 2023. Google Earth Each of the current fenced-off areas has a pair of semi-circular hangars that are approximately 80 feet long and 64 feet wide. One of the sections also has a rectangular hangar, which dates back to the original construction in this part of the base, and that is some 120 feet long and 60 feet wide. Both areas have 70-foot by 70-foot open-ended sunshade-style enclosures leading to the shared taxiway, which is just over 70 feet wide. This might point to the maximum length of the RA-01's wingspan. White triangles painted on the tarmac extending to one side of both of the sunshades look to be engine backblast warning areas, which could point to jet propulsion. This also points to these structures being scoot-and-hide shelters where ground personnel can load munitions and other stores, as well as conduct various other kinds of last-minute checks, away from prying eyes, including satellites above. A closer look at the hangars, sunshades, tarmac markings, and other features at the segregated section of Ramon Airbase as of August 2023. Google Earth The presence of two distinct fenced-off areas may also point to one or more other secretive drone types being housed in this part of Ramon Airbase beyond the RA-01s. This, in turn, could mean the hangar and taxiway dimensions, as well as the triangles on the tarmac, and not reflective of the RA-01's design, at least exclusively. Hangars can be used to hold multiple assets at once, too. The possibility remains that the RA-01s operate from elsewhere within the base, as well, and these facilities are used for other platforms entirely. It is worth noting in this context that U.S. drones designed for covert and clandestine missions, including ones deep inside denied areas, dating back to the height of the Cold War and that have now emerged into the light, range widely in size, complexity and configuration. Prominent examples of this diversity of designs (and specific intended mission profiles) include the stealthy flying wing RQ-170 Sentinel and the RQ-29, a converted civilian light sport aircraft. As noted earlier, Israel's aerospace sector has an established history of pioneering uncrewed aviation developments. Furthermore, though Israeli companies have not publicly demonstrated a flying stealth aircraft, crewed or uncrewed, it should be within their technical grasp. IAI, specifically, is known to have reached at least the wind tunnel testing phase of development on one high-altitude long-endurance drone concept with radar and infrared signature-reducing features, called the HA-10, in the 1990s. The HA-10 has been linked to the Israeli Boost Intercept System (IBIS) missile defense project, which envisioned a missile-armed drone to shoot down enemy ballistic missiles in their initial boost phase of flight. 'The UAV [uncrewed air vehicle] would have cruised at between 7 and 15 km [approximately 23,000 to 49,000 feet] altitude, and would carry an IRST [infrared search and track system], laser range-finder, datalinks and two to four [Python-series air-to-air] missiles,' according to an archived digital edition of Jane's Strategic Weapon Systems from 2002. 'HA-10 was designed with low IR and radar signatures, and was planned to loiter for up to 24 hours on station with a payload of 1,000 kg [approximately 2,200 pounds].' A rendering of the HA-10 design. IAI A paper that members of IAI presented at the 24th International Congress of the Aeronautical Sciences in 2004 describes the HA-10 as one of 'a number of additional high altitude advanced configurations' the company had previously examined 'within the framework of the advanced design activity.' IAI's 'HA' series does also include another non-stealthy design, the HA-13, that the company proposed together with TRW in the United States to meet the U.S. Air Force's Tier II+ drone requirements that ultimately led to the fielding of the Global Hawk. The possibility that the RA-01 is close in form and/or function to something like the HA-10 or the RQ-170, or even to a flying wing UCAV, would align well with the other details about the large force IAF exercise, as well as Israel's general operational considerations, especially with regard to Iran. Though the current Iranian regime is prone to sometimes absurd hyperbole, it has air defense capabilities that present real threats. Iran's shootdown of a U.S. Navy RQ-4 drone over the Strait of Hormuz in 2019 prompted notable discussions about the survivability of non-stealthy uncrewed aircraft in future conflicts that have had clear impacts on subsequent U.S. military planning. The RQ-170 has also notably been sent over Iran in the past, with authorities there recovering a largely intact example that went down inside the country in 2011. The RQ-170 Sentinel Iran recovered in 2011 on display. Iranian State Media It is also interesting to note here that initial work on the segregated section at Ramon airbase in the late 2000s came at a time when concerns about Iran getting more capable S-300 surface-to-air missile systems from Russia were growing. Those same concerns reportedly helped drive the IAF's decision to purchase F-35 stealth fighters. Iran also finally sealed the deal to acquire S-300s around the time that the work was being done to revamp and expand the fenced-off areas of Ramon. The construction of the initial segregated portion of Ramon also came around the time, broadly speaking, of Israel's covert 2007 strike on a secret nuclear reactor in Syria that Bashar Al Assad's regime had built with help from North Korea. F-16Is from Ramon were among the aircraft involved in that operation. The Syrian armed forces also have an air defense network that presents real threats, as exemplified by the shootdown of an Israeli F-16 in 2018. Watch how the IAF destroyed the Syrian nuclear facility in 2007 pic.twitter.com/HQqRd4xnba&mdash; Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) March 21, 2018 Other incidents over the years, including strikes against Iranian-backed militias in Iraq in 2019, have raised questions about possible secret Israeli drone capabilities. Advanced uncrewed aircraft operated by Israel and others might also, in part, help explain claimed incidents involving unexplained aerial objects over Iran in recent decades, which also often come with reports of heavy electronic attacks on perusing fighters and radar stations. Overall, for Israel, with its long and still expanding history of very long range and often covert and/or clandestine strikes on high-value targets in foreign countries, a drone just having the ability to persistently surveil far-flung and denied areas would be of great value. Stealthy uncrewed aircraft capable of conducting intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions could also provide important pre and post-strike intelligence. A penetrating uncrewed ISR platform could also help provide early warning about potential threats and otherwise monitor areas of interest, all with a lower chance of an opponent like Iran even detecting their presence. As The War Zone has highlighted in the past, persistent surveillance that can help establish so-called 'patterns of life' in a target area from which various kinds of useful intelligence can be gleaned. Doing this while deep in denied airspace without the enemy even knowing they are being watched can result in much higher-fidelity intelligence products. As relevant examples, the RQ-170 reportedly helped keep tabs on Osama Bin Laden's compound in Pakistan before and during the U.S. raid that led to his death and the U.S. Air Force has at least explored using the Sentinel to help with bomb damage assessment. In the latter case, a test was conducted involving an RQ-170 assessing the impact of a GBU-57/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) bunker buster, a weapon specifically designed to be employed against deeply buried facilities like those housing much of Iran's nuclear infrastructure. An RQ-170 at Andersen Air Force Base on Guam. USAF There is also a question to be raised here about whether Israel might be a partner of some kind when it comes to the RQ-170 and/or related developments. The Sentinel has had its own role in keeping tabs on Iranian, North Korean, and Pakistani nuclear and ballistic missile programs. A true stealthy UCAV capable of prosecuting long-range kinetic strikes or launching non-kinetic attacks (such as electronic or cyber warfare ones) would give Israel further options for targeting high-value assets and penetrating into densely defended areas to get to them, as well as doing so in covert and clandestine ways. Even just having the ability to deliver a small munition for a 'hammer toss' against a singular high-value target would be a major capability for a platform of this kind. In addition, UCAVs typically have combat radii that are multiple times greater than that of a fighter. For Israel, this could enable them to conduct entire missions into Iran and back without any need to refuel in mid-air. The IAF has notably limited aerial refueling capabilities to support long-range penetrating missions by its known crewed combat aircraft fleets. Israel does also have means of conducting long-range stand-off strikes, including with air-launched ballistic missiles like Rocks.

In many ways, it is surprising that evidence like this that could point to an Israeli force of stealthy drones, and possibly UCAVs, has not emerged before now. The absence of such a capability within the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) would be equally curious in much the same way that it is odd that the U.S. military has abandoned interest, at least publicly, in stealthy flying wing UCAVs. The continues to be substantial work on developing and fielding UCAVs elsewhere in the world, from France to Turkey to Russia to India. China has made especially significant strides in this field in recent years. So, while these documents certainly do offer some insights into what was previously an unconfirmed capability, their contents should be of little surprise.

Boeing’s 757 ‘Catfish’ Flying F-22 Avionics Testbed Emerges With ...	As if it didn’t have a distinctive enough look already, Boeing’s 757 Flying Test Bed — better known as ‘The Catfish’ due to its unique and highly modified nose profile — has got some striking new colors. The red, white, and blue scheme is a direct reference to the livery this very same aircraft originally wore, as the prototype for the 757 family. Aviation photographer @Task_Force23 has shared with us photos of the repainted Catfish, N757A, Boeing's first 757 that made its maiden flight on February 19, 1982. Anothe review of the Catfish, more properly the 757 Flying Test Bed, in its retro livery. @Task_Force23 @Task_Force23 A close-up of the Catfish. @Task_Force23 @Task_Force23 It appears that the Catfish emerged from the paint hangar in Amarillo, Texas, in late July of this year, with its early-1980s livery reapplied.

The Catfish at Baltimore/Washington International Airport, Maryland, in February 2005. Sunil Gupta/Wikimedia Commons It’s not clear exactly why the jet’s original colors were reinstated at this point, but they certainly make N757A look even more striking. One possibility is to mark 25 years in service as a vital testbed used to perfect the F-22’s ever-evolving avionics suite. The Catfish’s current job in support of the F-22’s sensor suite is reflected in the Raptor nose grafted onto the forward fuselage, containing the AN/APG-77 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar. A swept-wing section atop the flight deck houses conformal antennas for the Raptor’s AN/ALR-94 electronic support measures suite. Less obvious is the Catfish’s use as a test platform for the F-22’s electronic warfare suite, low probability of intercept datalink, AN/AAR-56 IR/UV missile approach warning system, secure communications systems, and various other tactical subsystems. Inside the cabin of the 757 are computer workstations, server racks, and even a replica of the F-22 cockpit, with primary and secondary displays, as well as a throttle and stick, providing the highest level of realism for testing, including recreating the kinds of tactical and environmental scenarios that F-22 pilots would be exposed to in real life. Altogether, there is room on the aircraft for up to 30 software engineers and technicians to evaluate the avionics during testing.

James Richardson A U.S. Air Force F-22 Raptor from Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, flies in formation over the Joint Pacific Alaska Range Complex, July 18, 2019. The JPARC is a 67,000 plus square mile area, providing a realistic training environment commanders leverage for full spectrum engagements, ranging from individual skills to complex, large-scale joint engagements. (U.S. Air Force photo by Staff Sgt. James Richardson) While production of the F-22 was wrapped up back in 2011, it is still the U.S. Air Force’s premier air dominance fighter, and its sensor suite remains incredibly powerful. Continued trials involving the Catfish ensure that the Raptor remains on top of its game. This is primarily effected through incremental upgrades to the fighter’s hardware and software, most of which have been aided by the Catfish, which also plays a smaller role in the development of new tactics. As well as its usual home on the secure military ramp at Boeing Field, Seattle, the Catfish periodically deploys to Edwards Air Force Base, California, or Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, for development work, as well as taking part in major test events and exercises. For cross-platform integration, it has also been flown alongside other integrated testbeds, including the F-35’s Cooperative Avionics Testbed — nicknamed the CATbird — and additional platforms used by Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, and others. Under the Air Force’s Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program, the Catfish is almost certainly playing an active role in the development of the F-22’s successor. With the F-22 now being used as something of a test surrogate for technologies that are being developed under NGAD, as well as adopting technologies that have been designed for NGAD, the 757 Flying Test Bed will be feeding into both those programs. While there’s a long tradition of using surrogate aircraft as avionics testbeds, it’s interesting that the Catfish in particular seems to have influenced at least one similar platform operated by one of America’s major military rivals. In China, a specially adapted Russian-made Tupolev Tu-204C — itself essentially a clone of the 757 — is used for avionics testing. As you can read about here, this aircraft is being used as a flying integrated avionics testbed for the J-20 stealth fighter, Beijing’s closest answer to the F-22. The Chinese answer to the Catfish, based on a Tu-204C, with a J-20 nose and swept-wing section atop the flight deck, as found on the original 757 Flying Test Bed. via X There have been growing questions about the long-term future of the F-22 in recent years. However, in July of this year, the head of Air Combat Command said there is now no planned replacement for its Raptor fleet. With that in mind, the Catfish is likely to continue its valuable work for some time to come. It will now be doing this in red, white, and blue colors that pay tribute to Boeing’s classic 757 family of airliners.

South Korea Could Send Advisors, Weapons To Ukraine Over North Ko...	The first North Korean troops are expected to arrive in Russia’s Kursk region tomorrow to help defend it against Ukraine’s ongoing incursion, the head of the Ukrainian Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR) told The War Zone Tuesday. That information comes as Seoul is considering sending advisors and heavy weapons to Ukraine in response to Pyongyang’s deployment to Russia of upwards of 12,000 soldiers, including elite special operations units. 'We are waiting for the first units tomorrow in the Kursk direction,' Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov told us. It is unclear at the moment how many or how they will be equipped. 'We will see after a couple of days,' he added. Alarm about North Korean troop movements to Russia is growing in South Korea. After a meeting to assess the situation, South Korea’s presidential National Security Council said Pyongyang’s deployment poses a 'significant security threat' to both South Korea and the international community and is a 'blatant violation' of U.N. Security Council resolutions prohibiting military cooperation with North Korea,' the South Korean Yonhap News Agency reported on Tuesday. 'If the illegal military cooperation between North Korea and Russia continues, (South Korea) will not stand by but respond firmly in collaboration with the international community,' Principal Deputy National Security Adviser Kim Tae-hyo said, according to Yonhap. He warned of 'phased measures' in response to the level of their military ties. (LEAD) S. Korea vows to take 'phased measures' in response to N. Korea-Russia military cooperation Yonhap News Agency (@YonhapNews) October 22, 2024 'There is a possibility that personnel will be sent to Ukraine to monitor the tactics and combat capabilities of North Korean special forces dispatched in support of Russia,' Yonhap reported, citing a source. 'If deployed, the team is expected to be composed of military personnel from intelligence units, who could analyze North Korean battlefield tactics or take part in interrogations of captured North Koreans.' There are also unconfirmed reports that North Korea has sent fighter pilots to Russia. A South Korean government official claimed last month that North Korea 'dispatched fighter pilots to Vladivostok, a city in the Russian Far East, ahead of the first deployment of its ground troops on October 8,' Newsweek reported, citing TV Chosun. 'This could relate to training on Russian combat aircraft supplied to North Korea, the report said. But it could not rule out that Russia, which has suffered from a shortage of pilots' during the all-out war, 'had requested assistance from the North.' Training North Koreans to operate Russian jets, most likely its familiar Su-25 Frogfoot attack jets, would present a host of challenges including language barriers and doctrine, but it isn't out of the question. Reports suggest North Korea has sent fighter pilots to Russia to potentially assist in the Ukraine war, amid shortages of Russian pilots according to Newsweek.

That system is also known as the M-SAM, or Medium-range Surface-to-Air Missile, which is already deployed in South Korea and is optimized to destroy lower-tier ballistic missile threats. Beyond that, South Korea, a major arms producer, could also provide offensive weapons, like artillery shells, howitzers, tanks and multiple launch rocket systems, Yonhap and the South Korean Chosun-TV media outlet posited. Since the outbreak of the war, South Korea has provided the United States with 155mm shells 'on the condition that the U.S. is the ‘end user’ — a method that observers say might have enabled Seoul to give indirect arms support to Ukraine as the U.S. sends its own stockpiled munitions to Ukraine,' Yonhap noted.

'Other possible weapons systems that might be considered include South Korea's homegrown K9 self-propelled howitzers, K2 main battle tanks, and Chunmoo multiple rocket launchers.' Though not mentioned in any local media reports, South Korea also possesses indigenously produced ballistic missiles and combat jets, among other advanced systems, that would be of extreme interest to Kyiv. South Korea isn’t the only country contemplating increased support to Ukraine over the deployment of troops from the North. Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis told Politico on Sunday that it’s time for European countries to revisit French President Emmanuel Macron’s idea of deploying troops to Ukraine.

Yoon asked for access to NATO's battle management system. 'We hope that the procedure for joining NATO's Battlefield Information Collection and Exploitation Systems (BICES) is quickly finalized so that we can communicate with NATO in real-time and share data safely and effectively,' Yoon said, the South Korean Korea.Net news outlet reported. 'The NATO chief responded by saying he would strive to ensure swift progress.' On Twitter, Rutte said North Korea sending troops to Russia 'would mark a significant escalation.'

Those troops 'are expected to be deployed to the front lines as soon as they complete their adaptation training.' At least six of Pyongyang’s forces, as we previously noted, have already been killed in Ukraine. On Tuesday, the independent Russian ASTRA news outlet published video on Telegram claiming to show North Korean troops in Russia.

It calls for each side to provide military assistance to each other in the event of war. With that strategic partnership in place, having intelligence troops on the front to learn about Russia's capabilities would be an important asset for South Korea. As the war in Ukraine grinds on, North Korea’s supply of troops and arms to Russia helps Vladimir Putin continue his fight. The Pentagon recently said that some 600,000 Russian troops have been killed and wounded since the all-out invasion was launched in February 2022 and that September saw the highest rate of casualties of any month since. In response to assertions that her country is sending troops to Russia, Kim Jong-un, the powerful sister of North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un slammed South Korea and Ukraine on Tuesday for what she claimed was a military provocation against Pyongyang. She likened the two countries to 'bad dogs bred by the U.S,' the Korea JoongAng Daily reported. 'A military provocation against a nuclear weapons state may be led to horrible situation, unimaginable for politicians and military experts in any big or small country in the world with their normal thinking to experience,' she said in the statement carried by the Korean Central News Agency.

'If it's true that the DPRK soldiers are going there to join the war against Ukraine, it would certainly mark a dangerous and highly concerning development,' White House National Security spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Monday. On background, U.S. officials, East Asian diplomats and congressional aides are saying there is not much the U.S. to stop North Korea from sending troops to Russia. 'They concede that Washington has made little to no progress in slowing North Korea’s rogue nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, and if it can’t do that, it can only do so much to halt North Korean troop deployments to Russia, too,' those sources told Politico. There is no indication that the Biden administration will change its policies regarding 'no U.S. boots on the ground' in Ukraine or allowing it to use long-range weapons deep inside Russia as the result of these developments. However, as one of the world's best arms manufacturers with a deep reserve of ammunition, South Korea's direct involvement in this war could represent a significant boost to Ukraine's defense.

Japan Expands Carrier Capabilities With F-35B, Drones Could Be Ne...	A U.S. Marine Corps F-35B stealth fighter has for the first time operated aboard Japan’s biggest in-service warship, the Izumo class ‘multifunctional destroyer’ Kaga. We have previously reported on the significant modifications made to this amphibious assault ship to ensure it can operate the short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) jets, which Japan is also acquiring. At the same time, there are signs that Japan may also be looking to expand the fixed-wing capabilities of this class of vessel, including drones and potentially other crewed platforms. A Marine Corps F-35B flown by a test pilot from Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Two Three (VX-23) landed aboard Kaga for the first time on October 20, off the southern coast of California.

The Phalanx 20mm close-in weapon system (CIWS) previously mounted on the front of the warship was also removed. Subsequently, further modifications involved re-balancing and structurally reinforcing Kaga’s hull. Kaga shortly before pulling away from its dock in Kure City, Hiroshima Prefecture, in April 2023. @betafujihara via X Kaga was originally launched in 2015 and commissioned in 2017. Japan has previously tested the U.S. Marine Corps F-35B from the deck of a modified Izumo class warship, when the name ship of the class undertook trials in October 2021, as you can read about here. This was the time that Japan had operated fixed-wing aircraft from ships since the end of World War II. A video showing those trials is embedded below. Izumo was commissioned in 2015 and completed its first phase of modifications in 2021. However, the second phase of modifications, including the Kaga-style squared-off flight deck, are not scheduled to begin until March next year. Tokyo took the decision to modify its two Izumo class vessels for STOVL operations back in 2018, although there had previously been rumors that a return to fixed-wing carrier aviation was always likely, despite official statements to the contrary. While officially described as ‘multifunctional destroyers,’ the Izumo class warships were primarily helicopter carriers, prior to the STOVL modifications.

Photo by Andrew Lotulung/NurPhoto via Getty Images Once modified, the two warships will be able to embark Japan’s F-35Bs. 42 are on order and they will be operated by the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF), which also has a growing fleet of conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) F-35A versions. As the tests with U.S. Marine Corps F-35Bs suggest, the modifications to the vessels also pave the way to interoperability with American F-35Bs. While this would help maximize the utility of these vessels, especially bearing in mind the JASDF’s relatively small F-35B fleet, there remain questions about the feasibility of longer-term Marine Corps deployments aboard Japan’s carriers. This is something that also applies to the United Kingdom, which has raised the possibility of embarking Marine Corps F-35Bs more regularly to help boost its carrier strike potential. HMS Queen Elizabeth embarking F-35Bs from British and American squadrons during maneuvers in 2020. Crown Copyright Still, even if embarked on a more ad-hoc basis, or during cross-deck operations, Marine Corps F-35Bs will likely go to sea aboard the Izumo class in the future. What aircraft might join them is somewhat more intriguing. Last week, at the Japan International Aerospace Exhibition in Tokyo, General Atomics Aeronautical Systems (GA-ASI) presented a rendering showing its carrier-capable Gambit 5 drone — which is based around a common modular core ‘chassis’ concept — operating from an Izumo class warship. Concept artwork showing the carrier-capable Gambit 5 drone operating from the Izumo. GA-ASI This is not the first time that we’ve seen the Gambit 5 presented on an aircraft carrier. The drone was revealed in the form of concept artwork showing it on a Queen Elizabeth class vessel for the United Kingdom at the Farnborough Airshow in July. You can read about the overarching Gambit 5 concept here. A rendering featuring a catapult-equipped Queen Elizabeth class carrier with a Gambit-series drone ready to launch. GA-ASI Regarding the Gambit 5 on the Izumo class, C. Mark Brinkley, a General Atomics spokesman, explained to TWZ: 'It’s meant to open the discussion with attendees on sea-based options for autonomous collaborative platforms because we see that as a very real opportunity for many nations.' As to the drone itself, while the Gambit 5 is now also being suggested for short takeoff and landing (STOL) operations from land bases, it was originally developed for shipboard use. A company rendering of the Gambit 5 operating from a flattop. GA-ASI 'The biggest challenges for Gambit 5 are sea-basing challenges, not specifically short takeoff and landing,' Brinkley added. 'The ship is moving, the deck is moving, the weather and climate play a role. We’ve invested years of research and investment on projects such as the U.S. Navy’s Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) program and Carrier-Based Aerial-Refueling System (CBARS). We understand the challenges to operating uncrewed jets at sea, and we know that Gambit 5 can be made real.' Putting advanced drones on carriers is a growing area of interest right now, with China, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States all exploring options of how best to integrate uncrewed platforms, of different sizes, on these warships. In particular, the potential for smaller aviation-capable vessels to operate drones is being explored, with Turkey notably even seeking to field a carrier that’s specifically tailored to support drones. The Turkish Navy flagship, Anadolu, which is planned to be used as a carrier for different tiers of armed drones. Photo by Serhat Cagdas/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images In the case of the Gambit 5 concept, the vessel is provided with catapults to launch the drones, as was the case with the Queen Elizabeth class concept. However, the British carrier differs from the Izumo class in being equipped with a ‘ski jump’ launch ramp, originally for STOVL operations. The British announced plans last year to integrate assisted launch systems and recovery gear onto the ships in the future. Although there is no confirmation at this stage that Japan plans something similar for its smaller Izumo class ships, it would make them able to operate fixed-wing drones, and potentially even other fixed-wing crewed aircraft. As well as the Gambit 5 and F-35B, the GA-ASI concept artwork shows F/A-18E Super Hornet fighters and an E-2 Hawkeye airborne early warning and control aircraft operating from the Izumo class. While Japan already operates the E-2 in a land-based capacity, it has no known plans to acquire fixed-wing carrier fighters in the Super Hornet class. A Japan Air Self-Defense Force E-2C Hawkeye during the Cope North exercise at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam. U.S. Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Courtney Witt Airman First Class Courtney Witt There are huge challenges in adapting carriers that are already fixed-wing-capable to accommodate even slightly larger aircraft, due to space requirements and the dimensions of existing elevators and other infrastructure. Even if Japan was in the market for carrier-based non-STOVL fighters and E-2s, whether they would be able to incorporate them in the Izumo class is another question entirely. Also shown in the artwork is an SH-60 Seahawk series helicopter, a type used by Japan previously aboard a wide range of warships, including the Izumo class. Not shown, but another important type for the Izumo class is the MV-22 Osprey tiltrotor, of which Japan is currently the only export operator. Nevertheless, the artwork does reflect the potential that the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) and the Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG) that GA-ASI first developed for the U.S. Navy’s Ford class aircraft carriers could also bring new capabilities to the Izumo class and other aviation-capable vessels. We have discussed in the past how EMALS and AAG are well suited to bringing drones into carrier air wings since they can be finely tuned in terms of the forces they exert on aircraft during launch and recovery. This makes them especially relevant for operators looking to utilize smaller and lighter drone designs from flattops. For Japan, having a carrier-capable drone like the Gambit 5 would provide a powerful adjunct to the F-35B. The Gambit 5 was derived from the air-to-air-capable Gambit 2, but it could also be used for strike as well as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). Drones such as the Gambit 5 and or the same company’s MQ-9B STOL could bring important boosts in capability and overall capacity to Japan’s carrier air wings, which are now very much in their infancy. Faced with the prospect of a potential confrontation with China, armed carrier-based drones could help Japan generate critical additional ‘mass,’ supporting F-35B missions including in more hazardous scenarios, engaging targets in the air, at sea, and on land. Even unarmed drones would be valuable force multipliers, conducting missions such as ISR, command and control, extending targeting capabilities, and boosting situational awareness. Meanwhile, a drone like the MQ-25 Stingray, provided it could be integrated on the Izumo, would deliver aerial refueling to extend the reach of the carriers’ F-35Bs. A prototype MQ-25 Stingray. Boeing www.twz.com At this stage, it’s not clear if Japan is actively planning to add drones to the future air wings of the Izumo class and, if it does, whether they would be fixed-wing types requiring launch and recovery gear to be added. 'We are absolutely talking to potential customers at Farnborough about the concept,' Brinkley said in the summer, when the Gambit 5 was unveiled, but did not name any specific prospective buyers. The U.S. Navy is already signaling the centrality of drones in future carrier operations, with plans to eventually have up to 60 percent uncrewed aircraft in its carrier air wings. Very likely, Japan is watching such developments closely and looking at the options for adding drones to its already very capable Izumo class vessels. Until then, Japan will continue to work toward having crewed stealth fighters operational on these two warships, with the recent test flights by a Marine Corps F-35B the latest step toward achieving this.

Smarter MQ-1C Gray Eagle Is Getting Mojave’s Short Field Capabili...	General Atomics Aeronautical Systems (GA-ASI) has provided details on the latest iteration of its MQ-1C Gray Eagle uncrewed aerial system (UAS), specifically the Gray Eagle STOL, or Short Takeoff and Landing variant. The new version of the drone incorporates technology that was first demonstrated on the company-funded Mojave, a heavily armed drone descended from the Gray Eagle that was also designed to be ideally suited to operating from remote or austere locations with rough strips and limited logistical support. The new drone is also very clearly pitched toward the U.S. Army and foreign customers that need increase distributed operations — as evidenced in the concept art at the top of this story — dispersed operations in the Pacific specifically. GA-ASI describes the Gray Eagle STOL as its 'most rugged UAS design,' although it’s worth noting at this point that the basic MQ-1C Gray Eagle for the U.S. Army was already something of a design that put a premium on efficiency and usability. Derived from the Air Force’s Predator, the Gray Eagle — originally known as the Warrior — was tailored for warfare in the Middle East, used a heavy-fuel piston engine instead of a turboprop, and was intended to be operated by a cadre of enlisted soldiers. A U.S. Army MQ-1C Gray Eagle. U.S. Marine Corps photo by Cpl. William Chockey A U.S. Army MQ-1C Gray Eagle at Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center (MCAGCC), Twentynine Palms, California. U.S. Marine Corps photo by Cpl. William Chockey Further reducing the footprint in terms of logistics and crews, the MQ-1C was designed to take off and land automatically through secure line-of-sight links, before flying beyond-line-of-sight missions via satellite communications. Enhancements for the MQ-1C soon followed, including an extended-range model with double the range and endurance, a test example staying aloft for nearly two days nonstop in a demonstration above Southern California. Building upon the MQ-1C Gray Eagle, GA-ASI is now offering the Gray Eagle STOL, which emphasizes the ability to operate from unimproved surfaces or even ships at sea, thanks to its short takeoff and landing capability, which was previously proven using the Mojave, first flown in 2021. GA-ASI’s Mojave demonstrator during takeoff and landing trials on a dirt strip near El Mirage, California, on August 1, 2023. GA-ASI Using the Gray Eagle STOL, 'commanders can choose virtually any bases of operation and take advantage of unconventional locations not normally affiliated with unmanned aircraft or aviation operations as an added level of survivability and surprise,' GA-ASI asserts. The Mojave’s ability to take off and land in very short distances — including on dirt strips — is something we have reported on before. Its stated performance includes a takeoff run of 400 feet for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions, or 1,000 feet when armed with 12 Hellfire missiles. Other weapons options include the Dillon Aero DAP-6 Minigun, which has been live-fire tested from the Mojave at Army’s Yuma Proving Ground. Its STOL attributes also lend the Mojave to shipborne operations, as demonstrated during trials aboard the British aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales. The short-field performance is such that the Mojave can also conduct carrier-based operations, in certain configurations, without any need for a catapult to launch it or arresting gear during recovery. This STOL performance has now been ported over to the Gray Eagle STOL, as C. Mark Brinkley, a General Atomics spokesman, described to TWZ. 'Mojave is simply a demonstrator model for our overall STOL concept, meant to show the possibilities afforded by our medium-altitude, long-endurance UAS when STOL capability is added. It’s one-of-a-kind and was not designed to go into production as it is currently built. We continue to use it as a technology demonstrator and have some upcoming demos scheduled, as well as some public showings planned at various trade shows next year.' With that in mind, the Gray Eagle STOL also adds some features that were not found on the Mojave. These include the various technologies introduced on another improved development of the MQ-1C, namely the Gray Eagle 25M (or GE 25M), first flown in December 2023. Gray Eagle 25M. GA-ASI The Gray Eagle 25M was developed to provide the U.S. Army with the option to procure a more advanced version of the MQ-1C, which would incorporate various enhancements to better meet the demands of a future conflict, likely to be expeditionary peer conflicts rather than a counterinsurgency fight. Among these new features are an improved heavy-fuel engine, increased onboard power, significantly reduced maintenance requirements, and an expeditionary laptop-based ground control station. Brinkley says the new Heavy Fuel Engine 2.0 'increases reliability, durability and horsepower, from 180 to 200 horsepower. It features dual brushless generators, which will dramatically reduce field maintenance and deliver over 50 percent more electrical power for new payloads and mission capabilities. The new engine, gearbox, and generator design decreases major maintenance actions and virtually eliminates the need for overhaul. The design effort was focused on reducing field maintenance and extending the time between engine replacement by 40 percent over the current Gray Eagle engine.' The Gray Eagle 25M also has an improved flight computer, with five times more processing capacity, and a modular open system architecture to ensure new capabilities can be integrated quickly and relatively cheaply. According to GA-ASI, these might include new air-launched effects and long-range sensors. In fact, the manufacturer is making a lot of the Gray Eagle 25M’s ability to work with air-launched effects. In one press release, GA-ASI lays out a scenario in which the Gray Eagle 25M lobs air-launched effects toward enemy air defense systems in a large and very contested battlefield. As the air-launched effects close in on the air defenses, the Gray Eagle 25M acts as 'quarterback,' relaying data gathered by the smaller drones to other friendly elements, be they aircraft, long-range fires, or other platforms. Concept artwork from GA-ASI showing a Gray Eagle 25M launching the company’s Eaglet air-launched drones. GA-ASI The Gray Eagle 25M is fitted as standard with the EagleEye synthetic aperture radar, which can detect and track ground targets out to 50 miles and maritime targets out to 124 miles. 'We are developing a new Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) antenna and associated software for EagleEye, which will further increase its range and deliver significant mode enhancements, Brinkley says. 'The radar’s increased range and optimized multi-mode performance will allow the aircraft to operate well outside the weapons effects zone of most threat systems, adding another layer of survivability.' Reflecting the increasing threat posed by hostile electronic warfare jamming, especially to GPS networks, the Gray Eagle 25M is also designed for greater resilience, including vision-based navigation that can be used to overcome GPS jamming, and SATCOM anti-jam technologies. GA-ASI says that all of the improvements found in the Gray Eagle 25M are now also incorporated in the Gray Eagle STOL. However, with different engines, wings, and tails, the Gray Eagle 25M and Gray Eagle STOL are very different aircraft, and the STOL version is not available as a conversion kit for GE 25M. The end result is a drone that combines advanced features with the ability to fly a wide variety of missions, from land and sea. At the forefront of the expected spectrum of missions are expeditionary ones of the kind that would be likely in any future high-end conflict, such as one in the Pacific against China. The Gray Eagle STOL is being pitched for reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (RSTA), as well as attack, contested logistics, and other missions, in just such scenarios. Logistics is not a role that has traditionally been associated with drones of this kind. However, GA-ASI has explored the idea of underwing pods capable of carrying up to 1,000 pounds of cargo. The U.S. military sees diverse distributed logistics chains as increasingly essential for supporting future operations in contested environments, especially in the context of a potential future high-end conflict, including in the Pacific. As GA-ASI describes it: 'Gray Eagle STOL might go with American forces into an expeditionary base deep downrange, co-locating with them as necessary to support missions, including delivery of supplies with the range to reach from island chain to island chain for units separate from the main body. Operating from a semi-prepared landing zone, a dirt road, or any paved surface, it expands commanders’ options.' As we have reported in the past, GA-ASI sees a particular niche for the Gray Eagle STOL in the U.S. Army’s requirement for an armed scout and overwatch platform. In February this year, the Army announced it was canceling its Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) program, which was focused on the acquisition of a new armed scout helicopter, as part of a broader reshuffling of its future aviation plans to include a greater focus on uncrewed systems. Concept artwork for the Boeing entry in the U.S. Army’s now-canceled Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft program, or FARA. Boeing www.twz.com 'We’re trying to jump into that [opportunity],' GA-ASI’s Alexander told Breaking Defense in a previous interview when talking about pitching the Gray Eagle STOL as potential a gap-filler in the wake of the FARA program’s cancellation. 'We believe a Gray Eagle STOL would offer the Army new attack reconnaissance capabilities unlike any previous uncrewed system,' GA-ASI’s Brinkley also told The War Zone. 'We have already demonstrated Mojave’s ability to operate from austere and rugged dirt roads, to take off and land from a ship at sea, and now to attack targets with machine gun fire.' Whether or not the Army decides that the new drone would be a good fit for its armed scout and overwatch requirements remains to be seen, especially with lingering concerns about the survivability and, by extension, the utility of non-stealthy medium-altitude armed drones like these. In its favor, like the Gray Eagle in service today, the Gray Eagle STOL can also team with AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, a capability of increasing importance within the Army. Also now being pitched by GA-ASI is the MQ-9B STOL, which will come in the form of a conversion kit conferring STOL capability on the existing MQ-9B SkyGuardian and SeaGuardian. MQ-9B SeaGuardian. GA-ASI GA-ASI 'We are taking the lessons learned from the Mojave prototype and Gray Eagle STOL program to develop MQ-9B STOL,' Brinkley told TWZ. 'One airframe, with multiple configurations and mission options. It’s a huge win for MQ-9B customers.' The MQ-9B STOL is a significantly bigger aircraft than the Gray Eagle 25M/STOL. The MQ-9B has a 38-foot fuselage, 79-foot wingspan, turboprop engine, and maximum takeoff weight of 12,500 pounds. This compares with a 28-foot fuselage, 58-foot wingspan, and maximum takeoff weight of 4,400 pounds for the GE 25M. At the very least, the Gray Eagle STOL and MQ-9B STOL signal that there remains a lot of potential within the original MQ-1C Gray Eagle and MQ-9B platforms, and GA-ASI is continuing to adapt these aircraft to better suit the future battlefield.

'Iran’s finger is on the trigger as a greater surprise is awaiting the Zionists,' Tasnim stated. An Iranian military source told the publication that 'if the Zionist regime strikes Iran’s military sites, Tehran’s response will be ‘decisive’ and ‘beyond the estimates of Zionists.’' If Israel targets Iran’s nuclear sites, 'Iran will react and also reconsider its nuclear policies, the source added.' In addition, Iran warned Israel 'that if it targets Iran’s facilities and infrastructures in any manner, Iran will by no means remain committed to maintaining the scope, type and intensity of its measures at the previous level.'

The ongoing Israeli response has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians. 'I cannot sit here today and tell you that that negotiations are about to restart in Doha or Cairo or anywhere else for that matter,' Kirby said in response to a question from CNN’s Kayla Tausche Monday. Biden is 'deeply concerned' about the disclosure of classified documents regarding Israel's plans for its retaliation against Iran that found their way into the public sphere, National Security communications spokesperson John Kirby told reporters Monday afternoon. The White House could not say at the moment whether the documents were leaked or hacked. 'You can rest assured that he will be actively monitoring the progress of the investigative effort to figure out how this happened,' Kirby said. The documents, dated October 15 and 16, began circulating online Friday after being posted on the Iranian-linked Middle East Spectator Telegram channel. 'An informed source within the U.S. intelligence community has shared with us an extremely sensitive 'top secret' U.S. intelligence document from the NGIA, dated Oct, 15-16, detailing Israeli preparedness for an extensive strike inside Iran,' Middle East Spectator claimed. One of the documents, which says it was compiled by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGIA), 'says the plans involve Israel moving munitions around,' according to CNN. 'Another document says it is sourced to the National Security Agency and outlines Israeli air force exercises involving air-to-surface missiles, also believed to be in preparation for a strike on Iran. CNN is not quoting directly from or showing the documents.' The documents are meant to be seen only by the US and its ‘Five Eyes’ allies — Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom,' according to CNN, adding that the US is investigating the leak, A US official said the investigation 'is examining who had access to the alleged Pentagon document. Any such leak would automatically trigger an investigation by the FBI alongside the Pentagon and US intelligence agencies,' the network noted. 'The FBI declined to comment.' While the U.S. said the documents are real, and there are no indications they are not, there is always the possibility that even parts of them were disclosed on purpose as part of an information operation.

'Pervading everything, the overwhelming stench of rotting flesh mixed with concrete dust at the scene where 23 people including two children were killed, according to local officials,' NBC News noted.

Earlier Monday, Israel Hayom reported that Hezbollah forces captured by the IDF in southern Lebanon testified in their investigations that Hezbollah paid money to UNIFIL personnel to use their bases for operations. 'These sources, privy to the details, revealed that Hezbollah also took control of UNIFIL cameras in compounds near the Israeli border and utilized them for their own purposes,' Israel Hayom reported. 'In light of these revelations and UNIFIL's glaring failure to prevent Hezbollah's entrenchment along the border Israel plans to rely primarily on commitments from the Lebanese army in any future arrangement with Lebanon, rather than on UNIFIL, which has proven ineffective over the years and is now accused of frequently collaborating with Hezbollah operatives.'

The Jerusalem Post (@Jerusalem_Post) October 21, 2024 The UN, meanwhile, repeated its complaint that the IDF is striking UNIFIL forces in southern Lebanon. 'Yet again, we remind the IDF and all actors of their obligations to ensure the safety and security of UN personnel and property and to respect the inviolability of UN premises at all times,' UNIFIL stated. The mission also reiterated 'that the violation of a UN site and damage to its assets constitutes a flagrant violation of international law and Security Council resolution 1701, the unanimously adopted text to end to a 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah and chart a path towards security on the border between Israel and Lebanon.' In addition, it stated that the Israeli army 'has repeatedly asked UNIFIL to vacate its positions along the Blue Line and has deliberately damaged UN positions.' Despite the pressure on the mission and troop-contributing countries, UNIFIL stressed that peacekeepers remain in all their positions, the mission’s statement said on Sunday. 'We will continue to carry out our mandated tasks of monitoring and reporting,' the statement concluded.

Our First Look At Land-Based Aegis Missile Defense System In Guam	We have gotten what appears to be our first view of a Mk 41 vertical launch system (VLS) for the Aegis Ashore air defense system that has been installed on the highly strategic American island of Guam in the Pacific. The land-based Mk 41 launchers are one step toward addressing the vulnerabilities of the U.S. military bases on the island to attack — something that China, in particular, has directly referenced in the context of a full-scale conflict in the region. Ultimately, Aegis Ashore on Guam will be just one element in plans to make the island’s airspace the most heavily defended anywhere on Earth. A photo showing the VLS array installed in an above-ground structure was published by the Defense Visual Information Distribution Service (DVIDS) on October 17. The image was part of a series from Joint Task Force Micronesia showing a visit to the island by Acting Under Secretary of the Navy Tom Mancinelli. Acting Under Secretary of the Navy Tom Mancinelli is greeted by Navy Cmdr. Mark Klein, commanding officer of Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron (HSC) 25, during a tour of Guam, Oct. 17. U.S. Navy photo by William J. Busby III William Busby According to information provided by DVIDS, Mancinelli received briefings from military leaders on 'critical defense infrastructure, force readiness, and emerging threats in the Indo-Pacific region.' Mancinelli was also shown flying over the island in a U.S. Navy MH-60 Seahawk helicopter, all part of his gaining a 'comprehensive understanding of key strategic locations across the island, highlighting Guam's essential role in U.S. military operations and regional security.' Acting Under Secretary of the Navy Tom Mancinelli tours Guam by helicopter with Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron (HSC) 25 on Oct. 16, 2024. U.S. Navy photo by William J. Busby III William Busby Most intriguing, however, is the photo showing the Mk 41 VLS array, the caption of which actually describes Mancinelli’s tour of a different air defense system — the U.S. Army Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery on the island. As TWZ has discussed before, THAAD has been deployed continuously to the island for many years now. It was sent there particularly to counter the possibility of a North Korean strike, as well as any other potential contingencies, but the growing threat from China far eclipses that of North Korea. As part of the efforts to drastically upgrade Guam’s defenses, the U.S. Navy is installing a version of the Aegis Ashore system on Guam, in addition to similar facilities in Poland and Romania, plus a dedicated test site in Hawaii. The U.S. Aegis Ashore site in Romania. USN Typically, Aegis Ashore facilities comprise a main ‘deckhouse’ and associated support building, as well as the VLS arrays seen in the photo at the top of this article. The deckhouse accommodates the Aegis Combat System and AN/SPY-1 radar, among other things, and mimics portions of Flight IIA Arleigh Burke class destroyers. This reflects the Aegis Ashore’s heritage in the sea-based Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) system, which you can read about in more detail here. Aegis Ashore is primarily designed to engage ballistic threats during the midcourse portion of their flight outside the Earth's atmophere using SM-3 interceptors. However, the Mk 41 is a modular launcher, meaning that additional anti-missile interceptors, such as the terminal-stage intercept and anti-air SM-6 and the forthcoming Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI), which could also be added. With its ability to take down certain incoming hypersonic threats, as well as other weapons, the GPI could be especially relevant for the defense of Guam. With additional launchers, even dispersed around the island, shorter-ranged missiles, such as the Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) Block II and even the latest SM-2s, could feasibly provide protection against air breathing threats, such as cruise missiles and drones. Patriot interceptors are now also now a possibility. While its capabilities are much in demand, there are various issues that make the installation of the traditional Aegis Ashore more complicated in Guam. Not only does the island have limited space for such a facility with the right lines of sight for its radar and radio systems, but the terrain is mountainous. In its basic configuration, Aegis Ashore needs a relatively large amount of flat open space and it has to be positioned to maximize radar coverage relative to potential threats. The difficulty in installing Aegis Ashore in an environment like this contributed to Japan’s decision to abandon its own plans for the system. An MDA briefing slide showing a notional layout of the Aegis Ashore site in Poland, as of 2013, given a sense of the physical space requirements. MDA As TWZ wrote in the past, 'placing portions of a future Aegis Ashore system on Guam in facilities underneath mountains or on mobile platforms on land, or even just off the coast, could certainly help with figuring out exactly how to make it work, from a basic design perspective, within the physical limitations that the island imposes.' The U.S. military previously said they planned to have the site operational by 2026. We have approached the Navy for comment on the current status of Aegis Ashore on Guam. Ultimately, Aegis Ashore should be much better adapted to Guam’s specific requirements, forming part of the planned Enhanced Integrated Air and Missile Defense (EIAMD) system. Last year, the U.S. military revealed that a total of 20 separate sites were currently under consideration to host surface-to-air interceptors, radars, and more, under EIAMD. A map showing the 20 sites on Guam under consideration to host elements of the Enhanced Integrated Air and Missile Defense system. MDA Using a distributed and tiered ‘system of systems’ approach, EIAMD is planned to provide 360-degree air and missile defense for Guam, with capabilities to deal with a wide spectrum of aerial threats. While the VLS array photographed last week may look familiar, overall, Aegis Ashore in Guam will probably look very different from the sites in Eastern Europe. As well as the potential to integrate additional missiles into the versatile Mk 41 VLS, Guam’s Aegis Ashore could have its various elements distributed to a much more significant degree than its predecessors, improving survivability and making better use of the island’s challenging geography. In the past, there was talk of the possibility that portions of Guam’s Aegis Ashore site could go into bunkers underground or onto mobile platforms or even vessels. Based on this one photo, the site uses the standard above-ground structure for its VLS — at least for now. A satellite image of Guam. Google Earth 'I can see Aegis being underground or mobile,' the Missile Defense Agency’s (MDA) director, U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Jon Hill, said, back in 2021. 'It’s not new science separating radars from weapons.' That might still be an option in the future, especially as the Pentagon is well aware of the potential vulnerabilities of a fixed above-ground facility, especially in a major conflict with a near-peer adversary, like China. EIAMD will also include at least four AN/TPY-6 radars, which were formerly known as the Homeland Defense Radar-Guam. This radar makes use of technology developed for the Lockheed Martin Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) used in Alaska. The Long Range Discrimination Radar at Clear Space Force Station, Alaska. MDA MISSILE DEFENSE AGENCY As we have discussed previously, regardless of any vulnerabilities that might be inherent in the static and above-ground nature of the basic system, Aegis Ashore is intended to primarily provide an additional line of defense against limited ballistic missile strikes launched by smaller ‘rogue’ actors, such as Iran. It is not seen as a broader strategic deterrent or a more robust missile defense capability for an all-out war with a peer competitor. Taken by itself, Aegis Ashore would be vulnerable to attack by China, which would use saturation strikes by its growing ballistic missile arsenal to overwhelm it, as it targeted the various U.S. military bases across the island. However, in Guam, Aegis Ashore by itself would be more about providing complementary coverage to other anti-missile defenses, including the aforementioned THAAD. That system has its own limitations, only being capable of intercepting ballistic missiles in the terminal stages of their flight. At the same time, its AN/TYP-2 radar is unidirectional, so it cannot provide 360-degree coverage against incoming threats. But as the island's defenses rapidly evolve, Aegis ashore will be a core component of the sprawling Enhanced Integrated Air and Missile Defense system. Patriot, directed energy systems, and the Army's new Enduring Shield lower-tier air defense system, among others. are all likely to play a part. Taken together, this highly diverse and distributed system, which will also be able to link with warships, aircraft, and especially space-based surveillance systems, will make Guam arguably the most highly defended piece of land on the planet. A transporter-erector-launcher for interceptors associated with the THAAD system. DOD At the same time, even with the best air defenses available, wider concerns about survivability are driving the U.S. military to work on expanding its available basing options across the Pacific, to provide alternatives to well-established bases like those in Guam. This includes alternate operating locations on nearby islands in the Marianas archipelago. Even though questions remain about how Aegis Ashore in Guam will eventually look and what kinds of more survivable and other elements will be included in the overall air defense architecture, the photo of the new VLS underscores the fact that the Pentagon is now on its way to drastically upgrading the island's defenses. Hopefully the move to finally do so isn't too little, too late.

Questions Linger Over Australia’s Role In B-2 Spirit Strikes On Y...	The U.S. Air Force used air bases in Australia to support the strikes on Houthi weapons bunkers in Yemen by B-2 stealth bombers earlier this week. At this point, there is some confusion as to whether B-2s were among the aircraft that used Australian bases, but USAF tankers likely supported the bombers, launching refueling operations from Australian soil. You can read our initial coverage and analysis of the B-2 strikes in Yemen here. Regardless, the development reflects the expanding military and strategic alliance between the United States and Australia, which has included upgrades for Australian air bases, specifically to better accommodate U.S. bombers. The Australian Department of Defense has confirmed that Australian support for the U.S. strikes on Yemen on the night of October 16/17 did include 'access and overflight for U.S. aircraft in northern Australia.' A report from Australia’s national broadcaster ABC stated that 'A remote Northern Territory air base has been used as a staging post for this week’s major U.S. airstrike on underground Houthi weapons stores in Yemen.' This could point to Royal Australian Air Force Base Tindal, a remote installation south of Darwin, which has been receiving upgrades to better accommodate U.S. bomber deployments, as you can read about here. The work is projected to be completed in late 2026. Available low-resolution satellite imagery for the dates in question doesn’t show any B-2s at Tindal — which is not conclusive in itself — but there are other possible operating locations in northern Australia, including some auxiliary installations. RAAF Tindal seen in May of 2024 with the new apron for supporting U.S. bombers under construction. (Google Earth) Subsequently, the same broadcaster reported that the Australian Department of Defense would not confirm or deny whether U.S. aircraft involved in the strikes had taken off from Tindal. The emphasis on taking off may be critical here, as we will discuss later. The ABC report on the subject was then altered to include a statement from an Australian Department of Defense spokesperson who said that B-2s were not operating out of Tindal, but would not provide further comments, due to operational security. There has been plenty of speculation that B-2s at least used Tindal to recover to, landing there after the Yemen raid. That remains possible since the later Australian Department of Defense comment was in response to a question as to whether the stealth bombers were operating out of the base (i.e. taking off for the raid) as opposed to landing there afterward. As for the official U.S. line, this appears to point to a roundtrip from Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri, the main operating base for the type, although it may be the case that one or more Australian bases were made available as an alternative landing site, after the mission. If the flight was direct, it would have literally flown around the world. According to multiple US officials: The American B2 stealth bombers dropped multi-thousand pound bombs, not GBU-57's, on 5 underground Houthi weapons storage targets in Yemen last night. The choice of the B2, which flew roundtrip from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, was…&mdash; Jennifer Griffin (@JenGriffinFNC) October 17, 2024 The periodic presence of U.S. bombers in Australia is by no means new, dating back to the early 1980s, while larger-scale training exercises in the country have involved U.S. bombers since 2005. More recently, the Enhanced Air Cooperation Initiative has been in place, involving deeper efforts to have the RAAF and U.S. military aircraft work closer together, with regular bomber rotations since 2018. B-2s have been regular visitors to Australia in recent years, with four of the stealth bombers having deployed to RAAF Base Amberley, in Queensland, in 2022, something you can read more about here.

Photos — backed up by some satellite imagery — show KC-135 Stratotankers and KC-46 Pegasus tankers at Cairns Airport in Queensland and more KC-135s at RAAF Amberley, soon after the strikes. Even if B-2s didn’t make use of Australian bases for the raid, it seems that U.S. tankers did, which would explain references to 'access and overflight for U.S. aircraft in northern Australia.' An Australian official further told ABC that the support Australia provided was 'consistent with our long-standing alliance commitment and close cooperation, demonstrating the interoperability of our militaries.' 'Australia is committed to supporting the U.S., and key partners, in disrupting Houthi capabilities used to threaten global trade and the lives of mariners in the Red Sea, a vital international waterway,' an Australian Department of Defense spokesperson added.

U.S. Air Force photo by Staff Sgt. Spencer Tobler Staff Sgt. Spencer Tobler While the raids may well have degraded the Houthis’ ability to wage their ongoing campaign against shipping in the Red Sea region, as TWZ previously pointed out, they were also tailored to deliver a powerful and highly specific message to Iran, the Houthis’ primary benefactor. At this point, it’s unclear if that message was underscored by the use of the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, better known as the MOP, a weapon ideal for attacking targets including the extremely hardened sites related to Iran’s nuclear program. This looked like a distinct possibility, especially due to the fact that B-2s were used for the strikes. The MOP, weighing in around 30,000 pounds, can only be carried by the B-2. Two can be carried by each of the stealth bombers at a time. So far, the Air Force has not confirmed what weapons were used, although Air & Space Forces Magazine reports that the B-2s dropped 2,000-pound BLU-109-equipped GBU-31 Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM), citing a 'person familiar with the matter.' Munitions maintainers from around the Pacific assemble BLU-109 munitions at Osan Air Base, South Korea. U.S. Air Force photo/Staff Sgt. Stephenie Wade Staff Sergeant Stephenie Wade The BLU-109 is another precision munition with a penetrating warhead. Each B-2 can carry 16 of these weapons. It’s also possible that 5,000-pound class bunker-busters might have been used, although the exact status of this weapon in the B-2’s inventory is unclear. A very early graphic from the MOP program showing the bomb able to penetrate up to 60 feet under the ground. By 2007, the weapon was reportedly capable of burrowing nearly four times deeper than this. This also offers a comparison between the 2,000lb BLU-109-equipped guided bomb and 5,000lb GBU-28. DOD via GlobalSecurity.org As we reported at the time, whatever type of bunker-buster munitions were used by the B-2s, the raid was a very clear signal to Iran that the United States is uniquely well equipped to target critical facilities 'no matter how deeply buried underground, hardened, or fortified,' in the words of a Pentagon statement. While Iran was not mentioned by name, the implication is very clear. While acknowledging that it provided support to the United States, specifically in its effort to blunt the Houthis’ ability to target Red Sea shipping, Australia also didn’t mention Iran by name. Darwin lawmaker Luke Gosling told ABC that Australia works 'incredibly closely with the U.S. Air Force' in the north. Gosling added that there are 'no deliberate messages being sent from Australia, other than we are in lock-step with our allies in order to uphold a rules-based order upon which Australia’s security and prosperity is so dependent.' The most obvious example of the deepening relationship between Australia and the United States is the AUKUS initiative — standing for Australia, United Kingdom, United States. This is a wide-ranging effort, with standout items including the supply of nuclear-powered attack submarines to Australia, and increased intelligence sharing. A RAAF F-35A Lightning II, EA-18G Growler, and F/A-18F Super Hornet fly alongside a U.S. Air Force B-52H from the 23rd Expeditionary Bomb Squadron based at Guam during Exercise Talisman Sabre 21. Australian Department of Defense SGT Andrew Eddie At the same time, the United States has been ramping up bomber deployments at Tindal, while also sending bombers to other Australian air bases, as Washington continues to expand its military presence in the region. The upgrade work at Tindal includes an expanded apron with space for up to six B-52 strategic bombers, squadron operations facilities, and maintenance infrastructure. Once completed, the airbase will be much better able to host bomber detachments, as well as tankers and fighters, with work also addressing fuel and munitions storage and mission planning buildings. Work at Tindal, as well as AUKUS and other related developments, have been widely seen as a deterrent aimed toward China. While that remains true, it is now clear that the growing U.S. military footprint in Australia is also being leveraged to strike targets in the Middle East. Significantly, Tindal will add another forward operating location for U.S. bombers, on top of Hawaii, Guam, and Diego Garcia, also in the broader region. Although with appropriate tanker support, there is no reason why bombers can’t also use the base to support operations in the Middle East or elsewhere. It remains to be seen whether RAAF Base Tindal or any other base was used for the first time by B-2s conducting combat operations, but the fact that Australia was used to support air operations over Yemen, in and of itself, is a significant development, at a time of increasing military cooperation with the United States.

South Korea Intelligence Offers Assessment Of North Korean Troops...	South Korea’s spy agency released images on Friday claiming to show North Korean troops training at military bases in Russia’s far eastern region. The National Intelligence Service (NIS) said they are the initial wave of what South Korean officials say will be 12,000 North Korean troops, including members of its notorious special forces, fighting in Russia’s all-out war on Ukraine. 'The suspicions of ‘direct military cooperation between Russia and North Korea’ raised by foreign media outlets have been officially confirmed,' NIS stated. 'We will continue to track and confirm the movement of military cooperation between Russia and North Korea through close intelligence cooperation with allied countries.' That information comes a day after Ukraine’s spy boss told us that there are currently nearly 11,000 North Korean troops in eastern Russia, who will be ready to fight by Nov. 1. On Friday, Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, head of the Ukrainian Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR), told us that figure was revised upward to 11,800. At least six of Pyongyang’s forces, as we previously noted, have already been killed in Ukraine. The North Korean soldiers dispatched to Russia 'are currently stationed at Russian military bases in the Far East, including Vladivostok, Ussuriysk, Khabarovsk, and Blagoveshchensk,' South Korea’s National Intelligence Service (NIS) stated in a new assessment released Friday. Those troops 'are expected to be deployed to the front lines as soon as they complete their adaptation training.' All four bases are at least 4,000 miles east of Ukraine. NIS released images purporting to show at least 400 North Korean troops training at Ussuriysk and at least 240 at Khabarovsk. However, the number of troops and if they are even North Korean cannot be confirmed by the satellite imagery provided. A military facility in Ussuriisk, Primorsky Krai that South Korea's spy agency says shows an estimated 400 North Korean personnel gathered on a parade ground. (NIS) NIS claims there are about 240 North Korean troops gathered at a Russian military base in Khabarovsk. (NIS) NIS said it began observing North Korean troops in Russia back in early August. It detected First Vice Director of the Munitions Industry Department Kim Jong-sik - 'a key figure in North Korea’s missile development' - 'visiting the North Korean KN-23 missile launch site near the Russia-Ukraine frontline several times with dozens of North Korean military officers and providing on-site guidance,' the spy agency said in the assessment. NIS then 'closely monitored' the movements of the North Korean military and detected North Korea 'transporting its special forces to Russia via Russian naval transport ships from [Aug] 8th to the 13th, confirming the start of the North Korean military’s participation in the war.' To move these troops, the Russian Navy entered North Korean waters for the first time since 1900, according to NIS. '&#8230;four landing ships and three escort ships belonging to the Russian Pacific Fleet completed the first transfer of approximately 1,500 North Korean special forces from the areas near Chongjin, Hamhung, and Musudan to Vladivostok, Russia during the same period, and a second transport operation is expected to take place soon,' NIS explained. With more than 120,000 troops, North Korea has one of the world's largest special operations forces. They are tasked with five basic missions: conducting reconnaissance, performing combat operations in conjunction with conventional operations, establishing a second front in South Korea’s rear areas, countering South Korean/U.S. special operations forces in North Korea’s rear area, and maintaining internal security. Above all else, causing mayhem deep behind the front lines during a war with the South would be on the top of their to do list. It is known that these troops are North Korea's most hardened and go through extremely harsh training. Videos of their brutal demonstration have been circulating for years. NIS released a synthetic aperture radar satellite image claiming to show Russian ships at Musudan, less than 200 miles south of Vladivostok. The nature of the image makes that impossible to confirm without other supporting evidence. South Korea's spy agency claims this synthetic aperture radar satellite image shows Russian ships transporting North Korean troops to Russia. (NIS) This graphic from South Korea's spy agency claims to show the route Russian ships are taking to transport North Korean troops in the East Sea. (NIS) In addition, Russian Air Force AN-124 cargo jets 'have been frequently traveling between Vladivostok and Pyongyang,' NIS said. Before departing for Russia, North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un 'inspected the special forces unit twice before the deployment' on Sept. 11 and Oct. 2, according to NIS. North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un observed his special operations forces training before they departed for Russia. (NIS) The North Korean soldiers 'were issued Russian military uniforms and Russian-made weapons, and were also issued fake ID cards for residents of the Yakutia and Buryat regions of Siberia who look similar to North Koreans. It appears that they disguised themselves as Russian soldiers to hide the fact that they were deployed to the battlefield. Budanov confirmed that to The War Zone Friday. 'The first battalion of 2,600 troops will be formed in the 11th Airborne Brigade and are preparing for deployment in the Kursk region with documents of cover as Russian citizens from the Buryat and Yakutia regions,' he told The War Zone exclusively. In addition to what the NIS shared, other videos emerged on social media purporting to show North Korean troops training and being equipped in Russia. Video's have surfaced online allegedly showing North Korean soldiers at a Russian military base. The authenticity remains uncertain. If these are really North Korean soldiers is unconfirmed. pic.twitter.com/Ddzcn87NA3&mdash; NOELREPORTS (@NOELreports) October 18, 2024 Exclusive - Newly obtained footage from Russia's Sergievsky Training Ground showing North Korean troops being outfitted in Russian gear in preparation for deployment to Ukraine. pic.twitter.com/01Z4jZIiOe&mdash; SPRAVDI — Stratcom Centre (@StratcomCentre) October 18, 2024 The NIS assessment came after South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol 'convened an emergency security meeting amid mounting speculation that the North may be providing its soldiers to fight Russia's war in Ukraine,' the South Korean Yonhap News Agency reported. The presidential office said South Korea 'has been closely tracking North Korea's troop movement to Russia from the beginning in coordination with its allies, and will continue to monitor the situation and take all necessary measures proactively.' The North's move 'signals a major development in the military cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang besides their suspected arms trade, already criticized by the international community,' Yonhap posited. We reached out to the Pentagon and White House National Security Council for additional details and will update this story with any pertinent information they provide. This all comes in the wake of recent treaty negotiations between Moscow and Pyongyang. As we previously reported, Russian President Vladimir Putin submitted a draft law to the Russian State Duma recently seeking ratification of a strategic partnership between Moscow and Pyongyang, hammered out in June. It calls for each side to provide military assistance to each other in the event of war. Seoul has said it was considering changing its policy against providing lethal aide to Ukraine in response to that pact. In addition to offering new details about North Korean troop movements to Russia, NIS provided more granularity about Pyongyang’s shipment of arms to Moscow. NIS 'assessed that North Korea had provided Russia with a total of 13,000 containers of shells, missiles, and anti-tank rockets, as well as other lethal weapons, on approximately 70 occasions since August of last year.' The South Korean spy agency released satellite images purporting to be some of the vessels in North Korea's Nanjin port transporting the weapons to Russia. The Russian ship roll on/roll off container carrier Angara carrying North Korean weapons departing from Najin Port. (NIS) The Russian roll on/roll off container carrier Lady R carrying North Korean weapons departing from Najin Port. (NIS) As a result of GUR 'confirming North Korean weapons collected from the battlefield, the weapons North Korea provided to Russia included 122mm and 152mm shells, Bulsae-4 anti-tank missiles, short-range ballistic missiles such as the KN-23, and RPG anti-tank rockets,' the South Korean spy agency assessed. 'Considering the size of containers loaded on cargo ships traveling between North Korea and Russia, it appears that a total of more than 8 million 122mm and 152mm shells have been provided to Russia so far.' As we previously wrote, the Ukrainian government announced that the KN-23 short-range ballistic missiles that North Korea provided to Russia were used in attacks on major cities, including the Ukrainian capital Kyiv resulting in a significant number of civilian casualties. 'However, Ukrainian intelligence authorities analyzed that many North Korean weapons have a high defect rate and low accuracy, so they are being used for mass offensives to maintain the front line rather than precision strikes,' NIS added. As the war in Ukraine grinds on, North Korea's supply of troops and arms to Russia helps Vladimir Putin continue his fight. The Pentagon recently said that some 600,000 Russian troops have been killed and wounded since the all-out invasion was launched in February 2022 and that September saw the highest rate of casualties of any month since. Meanwhile, this could just be the start of a much larger deployment of North Korean forces to Russia. Pyongyang's greatest asset is the number of troops it has, with one of the largest standing armies on earth. While many are poorly trained and fed, Kim could trade large numbers of troops to Russia in exchange for things it desperately needs - hard currency, food and other goods, and military assistance. Russian doctrine is on display in Ukraine, flowing huge numbers of troops in so-called 'meat assaults' against Ukrainian positions. Even untrained North Koreans would help Russia continue to carry out those attacks. North Korea will also gain highly valuable combat experience on a modern battlefield, something it currently lacks. It remains to be seen just how well the North Korean troops will perform, but one South Korean military observer told us they will prove challenging to Ukraine. 'North Korean combat troops in Ukraine is alarming but not surprising,' said In-Bum Chun, a retired South Korean lieutenant general who ran that nation's special operations forces and is now a military analyst. 'They are the pick of the crop.' The public reaction in South Korea to news of North Korea sending troops to Ukraine 'is surprise and concern about the implications of these activities,' said Chun. 'I am sure the Ukrainians will have a challenge.'

Army Wants Its New Tank-Busting 155mm Artillery Shells To Work Co...	The U.S. Army is looking to give its still-in-development anti-armor guided 155mm artillery shells the ability to 'collaborate' with each other to help find their targets and otherwise be more effective. The rounds as they are envisioned now are already set to give artillery units a new option for engaging enemy tanks and other armored vehicles, even ones on the move, via indirect fires. Army Col. Leon Rogers, the service's Project Manager for Combat Ammunition Systems, provided an update on the Cannon Delivered Area Effects Munition Armor (C-DAEM Armor) 155mm shell, now also designated as the XM1180, at the Association of the U.S. Army's (AUSA) main annual conference in Washington, D.C., earlier this week. The C-DAEM Armor round, also known as C-DAEM Increment I, has been in development since 2018. The Army conducted the first live firing of a guided test article just this past March. A slide Col. Leon Rogers showed at this year's AUSA gathering showing plans for the C-DAEM Armor shell and other 155mm artillery ammunition developments. US Army 'C-DAEM Armor, XM1180, most people don't really know what that means, but what that gives the artillery community is a way to actually destroy armored targets,' Rogers explained. 'As you see in the future, it's about collaboration. Those rounds will be able to talk to each other.' Rogers highlighted specifically how this capability could help ensure that rounds don't double up on the same targets, facilitating a single barrage to engage and destroy more vehicles over a broader area. Networking the shells together could have other benefits, including helping the rounds fired find targets at all, even if they might be outside the range of their own onboard seekers. Depending on the level of collaboration and coordination between shells, as well as the ability of their seekers to not only spot, but categorize targets, they might also be able to focus their attention on target types that are pre-designated as being higher priority first. The current XM1180 design leverages the existing GPS-assisted inertial navigation system (INS) guided M982 Excalibur precision-guided 155mm shell, but adds a new and still unspecified all-weather seeker to find targets in the terminal stage of flight. There are future plans to develop a guidance package that is also less reliant on GPS to be more resilient in the face of jamming and spoofing, the importance of which has been underscored by observations from the ongoing war in Ukraine. C-DAEM Armor also features a new unitary shaped-charge armor-piercing warhead. In the past, it has been reported that the round is expected to have a maximum range of around 37 miles (60 kilometers) and the ability to scan up to nearly 11 square miles (28 square kilometers) for target vehicles. 'After the projectile has been fired, the sensors on the projectile will be used to search the area around its reported position, and if found, attack the target,' Peter Burke, Deputy Project Manager for Combat Ammunition Systems, said back in 2019, according to a report from Army Technology. As already noted, giving XM1180s the ability to collaborate between themselves could help eliminate the 'if found' from that equation and also help prevent targets from escaping being struck. The Army is not the only service to be interested in collaborative capabilities to improve targeting efficiency and effectiveness, as well as just reduce the number of munitions that are expended without hitting targets at all. The U.S. Air Force's Golden Horde program centered on the development of swarming networked air-launched munitions capabilities is one prime publicly known example. The baseline C-DAEM shell is already poised to give Army 155mm howitzers a valuable new precision indirect anti-armor capability. The Army's current Excalibur guided 155mm rounds cannot engage moving targets. The 1970s-era laser-guided M712 Copperhead 155mm shell, which was largely removed from service years ago, could hit moving vehicles, but also required a third party of some kind relatively close by to designate the target. As a prime example of the M712's limitations, earlier this year, The Wall Street Journal reported that Ukrainian forces had received Copperheads as military aid from the United States, but rarely employed them due to a lack of suitably equipped drones it could use to designate targets from afar. The Army also has unguided Dual-Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions (DPICM) shells, which are loaded with cluster munitions designed to defeat armored and unarmored targets. Cluster munitions, in general, have been increasingly controversial, in large part due to their potential to scatter unexploded submuntiions that can be threatening to friendly forces and innocent bystanders. You can read more about DPICM and these issues here. In addition to the XM1180, the Army is also currently developing a second round in the C-DAEM family called the XM1208, which is loaded with nine sensor-fuzed smart submunitions as a DPICM replacement. All of this now comes as the conflict in Ukraine has further underscored the value of artillery, particularly 155mm howitzers, on the modern battlefield, including for engaging enemy armor formations. On top of the Copperheads, the Ukrainian armed forces have received Excaliburs and DPICM rounds, among others, from the U.S. military. Recent videos from Ukraine’s 47th Mechanized Brigade showing FPV, DPICM, and Bradley fire on a Russian MT-LB with infantry; FPV strike on a Russian T-80BV tank with a roof screen causing a catastrophic loss; a Bradley IFV firing on Russian positions; and a video of a Russian… pic.twitter.com/hqgXVsra5e&mdash; Rob Lee (@RALee85) May 19, 2024 The U.S. military is working hard now to facilitate a dramatic boost in the production of 155mm shells of all kinds, including through the establishment of an entire new ammunition factory in the United States, to help meet Ukraine's demands as well as replenish its own stockpiles. At AUSA this week, Army officials said that 155mm shell production is now around 40,000 rounds per month, up from 14,400 shells per month prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The goals now are to get that figure up to 55,000 shells per month by the end of the year and eventually up to 100,000 shells per month in the future. Beyond more capacity to produce complete rounds, meeting these targets also requires expanded sources for various subcomponents, including shell bodies and explosive fillers. 'We don't get our TNT from any source in the U.S. right now,' Col. Rogers noted this week. 'And, oh, by the way, before the Ukraine war kicked off, just where we were getting our TNT from? Ukraine.' For the U.S. Army, there is also a growing question about what will fire C-DAEM Armor and any other 155mm shells in the future. The service announced this week that it was launching a new Self-Propelled Howitzer Modernization (SPH-M) effort to succeed its abortive Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA) program. The Army had announced in March that it was canceling work on the next-generation XM1299 155mm self-propelled howitzer it had been developing under ERCA as a successor to the venerable M109 series, due in part to issues with its extremely long cannon. The service has now awarded contracts to American Rheinmetall Vehicles, BAE Bofors, Hanwha Defense USA, General Dynamics Land Systems, and Elbit Systems USA to demonstrate alternative 155mm self-propelled howitzers as part of SPH-M. There have been separate discussions in recent years about options for modernizing or supplanting the Army's inventory of 155mm M777 and 105mm M109 towed howitzers, as well. A prototype the US Army had used in the development of the XM1299. US Army The Army has also said previously that the end of ERCA has put new emphasis on new, advanced 155mm shells, including long-range ramjet-powered types. The new C-DAEM Armor shell is already set to be an important part of that 155mm ammunition ecosystem and networked targeting capabilities could make artillery units even more effective in hunting enemy tanks and other vehicles in the future.

Nearly 11,000 North Korean Troops In Russia Preparing To Enter Th...	There are now nearly 11,000 North Korean infantry troops training in eastern Russia to fight in Ukraine, the head of the Ukrainian Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR) told The War Zone Thursday afternoon. 'They will be ready [to fight in Ukraine] on Nov. 1,' Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov told TWZ. The North Korean troops will be using Russian equipment and ammunition, said Budanov. The first cadre of 2,600 soldiers will go to Kursk, where Ukraine has established a heavily fought-over foothold (more on that later). It is unclear where the remaining North Korean troops will go, he added. 'We don't have the full picture right now,' said Budanov. Pyongyang's forces, as we previously noted, have already been killed in Ukraine. There are 11,000 North Korean troops training in Russia to fight Ukraine, Ukrainian Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, commander of the Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR), told us.(Howard Altman) Howard Altman Budanov’s comments came hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told reporters in Brussels that there are about 10,000 North Korean troops preparing to fight his country on behalf of Russia. Zelensky warned that a third nation wading into the hostilities would turn the conflict into a 'world war,' The Associated Press reported. The Ukrainian leader did not go into further details. Zelenskyy claims 10,000 North Korean troops are preparing to enter the war with Russia and some officers already been in occupied Ukraine helping the Russian armed forces use weapons provided by Pyongyang. via @HenryJFoy Christopher Miller (@ChristopherJM) October 17, 2024 A day earlier, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said in Seoul that Washington and its allies are alarmed by North Korea’s military support for Russia’s war in Ukraine but couldn’t confirm Ukrainian claims that North Korean soldiers were sent to fight for Moscow. On Tuesday, Ukrainian media reported that about 3,000 troops were forming part of the 'Special Buryat Battalion,' organized within the 11th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade of the Russian Armed Forces to fight in Ukraine.' As we previously reported, Russian President Vladimir Putin submitted a draft law to the Russian State Duma on Monday seeking ratification of a strategic partnership between Moscow and Pyongyang, hammered in June. It calls for each side to provide military assistance to each other in the event of war. In another sign of the burgeoning relationship between Moscow and Pyongyang, a report emerged on Thursday claiming that Russian troops are training to use North Korean self-propelled artillery. The Ukrainian-aligned ATESH group claimed on Telegram that a Russian soldier who is part of the organization said the training is underway at the Higher Artillery Command School in Saratov, about 300 miles east of Ukraine. ATESH did not specify what variant of self-propelled artillery North Korea provided.

Gen. Pat Ryder told The War Zone during a press conference Thursday afternoon. 'If true, that would demonstrate an increase in the cooperation between Russia and North Korea, and I think that would also demonstrate the dire situation [Russia] finds itself in, in terms of its forces on the battlefield,' said Ryder. 'As you heard us recently say, the casualties that Russia is experiencing on the front lines are extremely significant, upward of 600,000 killed or wounded, and so it just demonstrates the desperation in terms of identifying additional forces for their military. It's something that will continue to keep a close eye on.' By deploying troops to Ukraine, North Korea may lead South Korea's Yoon Suk Yeol government to rethink its policy of not providing direct military support to Ukraine, a U.S. expert said Thursday. According to South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency, Victor Cha, Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, made the remarks following media reports that the Russian military is organizing the aforementioned special battalion of North Korean personnel amid manpower shortages. 'I would imagine, it would make President Yoon very upset, and who knows what he's going to do if he's really upset?' Cha said at a forum co-hosted by the Asan Institute for Policy Studies and the Brussels-based Center for Security, Diplomacy and Strategy. Reports of N. Korea sending troops to Russia may prompt Yoon to reconsider its support for Ukraine: U.S. expert Yonhap News Agency (@YonhapNews) October 17, 2024 Budanov's statement is another indication of North Korea's growing role in Russia's all-out war on Ukraine and that it seems the size of the troop contingent that will participate has already grown larger than some had originally thought. The Latest On the battlefield, more than two months after Ukraine first launched its invasion of Russia’s Kursk region, one news organization is making a contested claim about the status of that operation. Ukrainian troops have lost about half the territory captured, according to the Telegraph. 'A senior Russian commander from Chechnya said that an estimated 50,000 troops were pushing back Ukrainian forces, who either had to ‘flee or end up in the cauldron,’' the publication reported.

Well-connected Russian and Ukrainian military bloggers have been reporting since Saturday that Moscow’s troops have punched through sectors of Ukraine’s front lines in Kursk, the publication noted. Col.-Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukraine’s Armed Forces, last week confirmed that 50,000 Russians were fighting in Kursk, according to the Ukrainian Suspline news outlet. He stressed, however, that such actions led to the weakening of Russian groups in other areas, in particular in the Zaporizhzhia, Kherson regions and the Kramatorsk direction. 'The situation in the Kursk region remains difficult, but under control,' the Ukrainian DeepState open-source intelligence group said on Telegram last week. 'It was a difficult and tense night, the Defense Forces of Ukraine are indeed carrying out stabilization actions, but it has not yet been possible to regain control over everything that was lost.' Russians have 'suffered considerable losses during the assault, so it will be difficult for them to gain a foothold,' DeepState added. 'The worst is now, probably, in Lyubimovka, but we have to wait for the end of the new round of maneuver warfare.' Ryder on Thursday pushed back on the assessment that Russia has recaptured about half the territory it lost in Kursk. 'Based on the information I have, that is not accurate,' he told The War Zone. 'There has been a small amount of territory retaken by the Russians in Kursk, but at this stage, nothing that we would consider significant.' DeepState'a interactive battle map shows that Ukraine has lost territory in Kursk in the past few weeks, mostly in the northwestern sector of its salient. However, it does not appear to be as much as The Telegraph asserted. The gray shows the position of Ukrainian troops in Kursk on Sept. 21. (DeepState) Much of that territory has been recaptured by Russia as of Oct. 16, according to DeepState (DeepState) Some Russian milbloggers meanwhile have reported a slowdown in the effort to repel Ukrainian forces.

He made those comments Thursday during a press conference in Brussels, after presenting his 'Victory Plan' to European Union leaders. 'Either Ukraine will have nuclear weapons, which will serve as protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance,' he said he told the former U.S. president and current Republican presidential nominee, according to the Kyiv Independent.

Zelensky also invoked the Budapest Memorandum, in which Ukraine agreed in 1994 to give up its nuclear arsenal in exchange for security guarantees from Russia, the U.S., and the U.K., the publication noted. 'The agreement resulted in Ukraine losing its nuclear shield, Zelensky argued, while other powers that have maintained their nuclear arsenal have not suffered from a full-scale war,' according to the Kyiv Independent. Zelensky emphasized that he would choose NATO membership over pursuing nuclear weapons. Zelensky spoke to Trump and said:'There are two choices.

Officials in Kyiv complain of a double standard because a THAAD battery has not been assigned to protect Ukraine, Politico noted. 'The reason why the U.S. acts boldly in Israel and cautiously in Ukraine is clear: Russia is armed with nuclear weapons and Iran isn’t,' a source told the publication. 'The tough answer that Ukrainians may not like to hear but is unfortunately true is that we can take the risk of shooting down Iranian missiles over Israel without triggering direct war with Tehran that could lead to nuclear war,' a senior U.S. Senate aide who works on Ukraine policy told Politico. 'There’s a lot more risk in trying that with Russia.' The announcement of its pending delivery comes ahead of an expected Israeli retaliation for Tehran’s massive missile barrage earlier this month.

The group, UAT-5647, also known as RomCom, 'has long been considered a multi-motivational threat actor performing both ransomware and espionage-oriented attacks,' the report states. 'However, UAT-5647 has accelerated their attacks in recent months with a clear focus on establishing long–term access for exfiltrating data of strategic interest to them. Our assessment, in line with recent reporting from CERT-UA and Palo Alto Networks, indicates that the threat actor is aggressively expanding their tooling and infrastructure to support a wide variety of malware components authored in diverse languages and platforms such as GoLang, C++, The RUST and LUA.' The cyber attack on high-profile Ukrainian entities is likely part of a two-pronged effort to steal data and place malware on these systems in order to disrupt and seek financial gain from the targets, the report concluded. 'It is also likely that Polish entities were also targeted, based on the keyboard language checks performed by the malware. In another cyber attack Russian hackers used Telegram to target the devices of Ukraine’s draft-aged men with the MeduzaStealer malware, Ukraine’s government computer emergency team stated in a separate report. MeduzaStealer 'was previously used by Russia-linked threat actors to obtain login credentials, computer information, browsing history and data from password managers,' according to The Record. 'Last year, a threat actor known as UAC-0050 deployed the malware against targets in Ukraine and Poland.'

Army Confirms It’s Exploring Requirements For A New Heavy-Lift He...	The U.S. Army is actively exploring options for a new-generation heavy-lift rotorcraft to replace the CH-47 Chinook. Although plans are still very much in their infancy, they have broader implications for future heavy-lift capabilities, especially for the Pacific theater. Confirmation that work on a Chinook successor is ongoing comes as the service progresses with its Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) tiltrotor, which will replace part of the UH-60 Black Hawk fleet, and after its cancelation of the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA), which would have partially replaced the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior armed scout helicopter, now retired without any plans for a direct successor. In response to a question from TWZ, Brig. Gen. Cain Baker, the director of the Future Vertical Lift Cross-Functional Team, or FVL CFT, at Army Futures Command, provided an update on Chinook replacement plans at the Association of the U.S. Army’s annual symposium yesterday. Within the Army, this is known as Capability Set, or 'Cape Set,' Four, part of the wider Future Vertical Lift (FVL) effort. FLRAA and FARA were responses to other FVL Capability Sets. Cap Set 4 also evolved in part from earlier efforts, including the Joint Heavy Lift (JHL) and Joint Multi-Role (JMR) programs. Future Vertical Lift Cross-Functional Team Director Brig. Gen. Cain Baker (center) at the 2024 iteration of the Experimental Demonstration Gateway Event (EDGE) at Yima Proving Ground earlier this year. Mark Schauer/U.S. Army It is important to note that Cape Set Four is not new and the Army announced the start of a new study into a potential Chinook replacement last year. 'We’ve done some initial studies on what a Cape Set Four looks like,' Brig. Gen. Baker explained. 'Those studies are still ongoing, very, very cognizant of the size of it, the type of lift capabilities we want from it, but also the affordability of that.' For Baker, Cape Set Four is very much a lower priority than FLRAA, which is anticipated to enter low-rate initial production in 2028 after which units will start to use them operationally in 2030. Concept artwork of the U.S. Army’s Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) tiltrotor. Bell Textron Bell Baker continued: 'We will start looking eventually at Cape Set Four, as we get the feedback on what we see out in industry that’s available, and then, more importantly, does it potentially meet the requirements that we think we need.' Of those requirements, Baker listed longer range, heavier payload, and fuel efficiency. While Baker admitted that there is still 'a lot of work to do on Cape Set Four,' he also made clear that 'it is definitely out there on the horizon that we’ve got to look at.' In the meantime, the Army's Chinook fleet — which numbers more than 470 aircraft — will soldier on as the service's heavy-lift rotorcraft for many more years to come. This could be aided by the latest Chinook Block II upgrade program. This includes new rotor blades, a revised fuel tank configuration, and other improvements, while there is also a separate option to add more powerful General Electric T408 engines. So far, however, the Army has only bought them for its special operations units. The first picture of a CH-47, tail number 067, with the new T408 engines, which emerged in late 2019. U.S. Army 'We’re going to ride the Chinook like we’re riding the C-130' added Maj. Gen. Clair Gill, Commanding General at the U.S. Army Aviation Center of Excellence and Fort Novosel, also speaking at AUSA and referencing the Air Force’s long-lived turboprop transport plane. Nevertheless, the Army's determination to field a Chinook replacement at some point in the future is a notable turnaround, compared with previous comments. 'There is no plan right now for a Cape Set Four or Five and the Army has been pretty consistent in saying that' Gen. John Murray, then the commanding general of Army Futures Command, declared in May 2021. 'The FARA — Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft — and the Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft are the two plans, [or] programs, we have working right now. There is nothing working for a replacement for the CH-47.' The first Raider X competitive prototype for the now-canceled FARA program in a hangar at Sikorsky’s West Palm Beach, Florida, facility. Sikorsky The first Raider X competitive prototype in a hanger at Sikorsky’s West Palm Beach, Florida, facility. Sikorsky Photo While that plan has now changed, it’s likely that the current focus on FLRAA has highlighted the demand for greater speed and range in the vertical-lift domain, especially in the Pacific scenario. The Army is already preparing for the step-change in vertical-lift capability that the FLRAA promises to bring. This will include a new ability to conduct Large-Scale, Long-Range Air Assault, or L2A2, operations, defined by the ability to 'deliver one Brigade Combat Team in one period of darkness, over 500 miles, arriving behind enemy lines, and be able to conduct sustained combat operations,' Maj. Gen. Brett Sylvia, head of the 101st Airborne Division, said during a separate talk at AUSA. L2A2 currently relies upon a fast-flying tiltrotor to be realized, with the specific range and speed advantage of Bell’s V-280 Valor demonstrator very likely being a major factor behind its choice for FLRAA instead of Boeing’s rival SB>1 Defiant. FLRAA is derived from the V-280 design. How this does or doesn’t translate to a heavy-lift rotorcraft is an open question. There is no tiltrotor in this category currently flying or in development — although the idea has certainly been raised in the past — leaving a dearth of any kind of platform that can fulfill the Army’s Cape Set Four requirements. A concept from the Karem Aircraft Company shows a future heavy-lift tiltrotor, in the C-130 size category, schemed for the previous Joint Heavy Lift program, which also fed into Future Vertical Lift. Karem Aircraft Company rendering While the structural and performance enhancements introduced in the Chinook Block II program add speed and lift to an airframe design that’s now over 60 years old, the helicopter offers nothing close to FLRAA levels of performance. At the same time, Chinook Block II has always been seen as a stopgap until a replacement platform can be defined, a conundrum Cape Set Four is now grappling with. Other than the Chinook, the only other suitable heavy-lift rotorcraft currently in production is the CH-53K King Stallion, as operated by the U.S. Marine Corps.

U.S. Marine Corps photo by Lance Cpl. Meshaq Hylton This program has been anything but trouble-free, with issues during its development prompting a demand from Congress that the Marines examine potential alternatives, such as the Chinook. On top of the Chinook Block II, another potential stopgap solution for the Army would be to re-engine its CH-47 fleet with T408 engines. This would provide a significantly more capable helicopter, building on its speed, payload, and hot-and-high performance. The T408s engines each produce 7,500 shaft horsepower (shp), around 2,500 shp more than the T55-GA-714As on standard CH-47F models. In the past, the Army’s reluctance to re-engine its Chinooks — and to buy Block IIs for regular Army units — seemed to be driven, at least in part, by a stated desire to move beyond the venerable design and instead look toward fielding a new heavy-lift rotary-wing aircraft, something that has previously attracted pushback from Congress.

Thomas Mort However, for some years now, there’s been a growing realization that today’s Chinook is not survivable enough in some scenarios for potential future conflicts with peer or near-peer adversaries. 'We needed a capability that could fly great distances at great speeds and penetrate, let’s say, a Russian air defense system,' Army Secretary Mark Esper told members of the House Appropriations Committee's defense subcommittee, back in 2019, defending Army plans to shift funds from the Chinook to future aircraft programs and modernization programs. 'The decision, I think, for the CH-47s for the conventional Army — what probably changed was, when the National Defense Strategy was issued, it told us to move away from counterinsurgency to high-intensity conflict,' Esper added.

U.S. Army photo by Markus Rauchenberger That means switching to advanced aircraft like the FLRAA tiltrotor and — until its cancelation — FARA, which emphasize high speed and long range as well as other measures to enhance their over survivability. The survivability question, in general, is one that has consistently been raised about rotorcraft of all types, especially when it comes to future high-end fights. In the meantime, the dense air defense environment faced by tactical aircraft — including rotorcraft — in Ukraine has demonstrated the vulnerability of traditional platforms even when exposed to older-generation threats. Along with concerns over rotorcraft survivability is the interest expressed by the Army (as well as the Marine Corps and Air Force) in distributed logistics chains, leveraging, at least in part, increasingly large uncrewed aerial cargo platforms. This could also raise questions about whether a new heavy-lift platform is necessary or cost-effective. A video showing the Kaman KARGO drone, one of the uncrewed aerial cargo designs the Marine Corps is currently considering acquiring. Another uncrewed option for future heavy-lift, vertical-lift requirements might be found in a fan-in-wing vertical take-off-and-landing capable type. Earlier this month, we reported on how Aurora Flight Sciences is working on a demonstrator aircraft in this category, as well as a scaled-up cargo aircraft based on the same technology. The demonstrator is being developed under a U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) program and reflects Air Force interest in a new high-speed, runway-independent special operations transport plane. If this concept actually comes to fruition and is operationally viable, it would provide a C-130-like payload with VTOL capability, and, even though it likely would not be procured by the Army, it could assume aspects of the mission set for the service. An Aurora Flight Sciences rendering of an uncrewed fan-in-wing VTOL-capable cargo aircraft. Aurora Flight Sciences Looking further ahead, the need for higher-performance vertical lift could potentially be provided by some kind of High-Speed Vertical Take-Off and Landing, or HSVTOL, aircraft. This is a concept that Bell is meanwhile has been working on, including now as part of the same DARPA program that Aurora's lift fan design is under development for. While this kind of aircraft promises to combine the ability to take off and land vertically using rotors as well as fly at jet speeds in forward flight, it is still very much in its infancy and significant hurdles — especially as regards the nature of the propulsion system — still need to be overcome. Bell’s latest three HSVTOL concepts are progressively larger, beginning with the smallest, known as HSVTOL Light, which is unmanned and scaling up to a roughly C-130-size transport. Bell The experience with FARA demonstrates just how quickly Army requirements can change and be superseded. With upgrades to ensure it remains relevant, the Chinook will be at the center of Army airlift for decades to come, but service officials are now talking openly about the need for a successor, even if that might not emerge until around the 2060s. With very few options, beyond more Chinooks, which don’t appear to meet long-term requirements, an all-new design currently looks almost certain. Rachel S. Cohen contributed to this story.

Secretive Phoenix Ghost Kamikaze Drones Rushed To Ukraine Finally...	The secretive Phoenix Ghost kamikaze drone, first developed for the U.S. Air Force and supplied to Ukraine in its ongoing fight against Russia, has finally emerged publicly. We now know for sure that Phoenix Ghost is not a single design, but a family of increasingly larger and longer-ranged one-way attack munitions from AEVEX Aerospace, some of which have been seen before, while at least one was only revealed this week. AEVEX confirmed the connection between various kamikaze drones it offers and the Phoenix Ghost effort at the Association of the U.S. Army’s (AUSA) main annual symposium in Washington, D.C., this week. The Pentagon first announced Phoenix Ghost kamikaze drones provided by AEVEX would be headed to Ukraine back in 2022, but scant information about them had subsequently emerged before now. Disruptor, one of the AEVEX kamikaze drones now known to be part of the Phoenix Ghost family. Jamie Hunter 'It’s been a long time coming,' Elizabeth Trammell, senior director of business development at AEVEX, told TWZ Tuesday. 'This has been around for a while … We’ve been able to receive specific permission to talk about it.' The Phoenix Ghost family of one-way attack munitions includes types with distinctly different forms and performance capabilities. At least some of the designs were derived from aerial targets that AEVEX originally developed for testing counter-drone systems, according to the company. Phoenix Ghosts were among the first kamikaze drones the U.S. military publicly announced it would be sending to Ukraine, but it had not been previously confirmed what they were and no conclusive imagery showing one had emerged before now. It is worth noting that the development of the Phoenix Ghost family, which traces back to a project under the Air Force's Big Safari special projects office, also predates Russia's all-out invasion of Ukraine in 2022. As such, AEVEX was very much ahead in the United States in working on one-way-attack drones, in general. I find it odd that with all the imagery and video pouring out of Ukraine of virtually every weapon system before, action, in action, or after action, we have yet to see a single confirmed image of a Phoenix Ghost suicide drone/loitering munition.&mdash; Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) July 25, 2022 All 'AEVEX loitering munitions use visual-based navigation to autonomously identify and follow landmarks or features in their environment, enabling precise positioning and pathfinding without reliance on GPS,' according to the company's website. 'Our systems leverage alternative PNT [precision navigation and timing] solutions to maintain precise navigation and operational capability in GPS-denied or degraded environments.' In addition, 'AEVEX loitering munitions automatically detect, identify, locate, report (DILR) and deliver lethal and non-lethal effects against threats across multiple scenarios and domains with unprecedented accuracy and speed' and are able to 'navigate, make decisions, and complete missions without direct intervention,' the company says. However, the drones can also be fitted with line-of-sight links and/or mesh networked radios, as well as electro-optical and infrared sensors, to provide some degree of direct control. In addition to acting as kamikaze drones, AEVEX says the uncrewed aerial systems in its product line can be configured for electronic and cyber warfare and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Among the specific kamikaze drones AEVEX has now disclosed as being part of the Phoenix Ghost family are Dominator and Disruptor, which are in the so-called Group 3 category. The U.S. military defines Group 3 drones as weighing between 55 and 1,320 pounds, being able to fly at altitudes between 3,500 and 18,000 feet, and having top speeds of between 100 and 250 knots. While the Dominator was previously disclosed, Disruptor was only publicly unveiled this week. Disruptor, which has a tubular carbon fiber main body, a pair of straight main wings, and a v-tail configuration, is 10.1 feet long and has a wingspan of 15.75 feet. It has a maximum takeoff weight of 185 pounds when launched pneumatically, but this can be increased to 205 pounds by using a rocket-assisted launch method. AEVEX also states that the Disruptor can be vehicle-launched, but has not provided any further details. Powered by a small internal combustion engine driving a two-bladed pusher propeller, Disruptor can stay aloft for 4.5 hours and fly out to a maximum range of at least 372 miles (598 kilometers) with a 50-pound payload. The company also offers a version using electronic fuel injection (EFI), increasing its endurance to 11.6 hours and extending its range out to 822 miles (1,322 kilometers). Disruptor's engine and propeller. Jamie Hunter Disruptor is interestingly similar, at least in very broad strokes, to kamikaze drones that Iran has developed or helped its proxies develop, such as the Shahed 101. AEVEX says the Group 3 Dominator is dimensionally identical to Disruptor in terms of overall length and wingspan, but it has a completely different twin-boom configuration with an inverted v-shaped tailplane. This a very common configuration for drones in this general size class, with the RQ-7 Shadow, which the U.S. Army announced plans to retire in Febraury, being just one example. There is also the Aerosonde family, versions of which remain in service with the U.S. special operations community. Other twin boom drones with v-shaped and straight tailplanes, including ones made in China, are also in widespread use globally. The Dominator drone. AEVEX Dominator has maximum takeoff weights of 205 and 225 pounds when launched pneumatically or in a rocket-assisted mode, respectively. With a similar, if not identical propulsion system to Disruptor, Dominator has maximum endurances of 4.6 and 11.7 hours and ranges of 293 and 743 miles (492 and 1,196 kilometers) with and without EFI. A Dominator drone on a pneumatic launcher. AEVEX The Phoenix Ghost family also includes a smaller Group 2 drone called Atlas, another design that AEVEX has previously shown publicly. Per the U.S. military definitions, uncrewed aerial systems in this category weigh between 21 and 55 pounds, can fly at altitudes up to 3,500 feet, and attain top speeds of up to 250 knots. The Atlas, which has what looks to be pop-out main wings and v-tail, has a maximum takeoff weight of 20.9 pounds, including an 8.1-pound payload, and is 2.9 feet long and has a wingspan of 5.5 feet, per AEVEX's website. Its stated endurance is between one and two hours, with a maximum range of at least 74 miles (120 kilometers). How Atlas is powered is not immediately clear, but it has a pusher propeller at the rear. The Atlas drone. AEVEX At AUSA this week, AEVEX had a product card detailing another drone called Dagger, which also does not appear to have been previously disclosed and looks to be a Group 2 analog to Disruptor. It is unclear whether the electrically powered Dagger is technically part of the Phoenix Ghost family or is a design that followed on from that work. Dagger is six feet long and has a wingspan of 8.7 feet, has a maximum takeoff weight of 35 pounds (including an eight-pound payload), and can fly for up to 80 minutes and out to a range of 120 miles (193 kilometers). A picture of the rendering of the Dagger drone seen on the AEVEX product card at AUSA. Jamie Hunter Dagger is designed to make it easier for troops to 'move in, get out, set up, shoot off, and … get out of there,' AEVEX's Trammell explained to TWZ at AUSA. AEVEX's Trammel also said that the Phoenix Ghost family encompasses multiple other assets that the company is keeping under wraps for now. The company is also continuing to evolve its product line, in part based on experiences from the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. AEVEX uses a two-week design cycle to let the company quickly respond to new threats and conditions troops encounter on the ground. 'We've learned a lot,' Trammell said. 'This [Distruptor] does not look anywhere near what it was when we first put it out.' The nose cone has changed, she said, as has the color. She indicated the colors have evolved to better camouflage the weapons around the clock. Ukrainian officials notably began highlighting Russia's use of black or otherwise darkly painted kamikaze drones, and that this had made it difficult to visually spot and track them, especially at night, last year. Ukraine has since been observed employing kamikaze drones with similar paint schemes. Another view of the Disruptor drone on the floor of this year's AUSA show, highlighting its dark paint job. Jamie Hunter As the war in Ukraine grinds through its third year, Trammell also expects demand will grow for the drones to collect more intelligence and play a larger role in electronic warfare. AEVEX is also known to be looking at enhancing Phoenix Ghost’s resistance to GPS jamming, something that has been a significant problem in Ukraine, for both drones and guided munitions. The company says its acquisition of Veth Research Associates should see that company’s guidance and navigation technology inserted into Phoenix Ghost drones, according to Aviation Week. When it comes to Ukraine, it remains unclear what types of Phoenix Ghost drones the country has received to date and how they are specifically configured in terms of payloads and guidance capabilities. To date, the U.S. military has pledged at least 1,800 Phoenix Ghosts to Ukraine. The U.S. military said had obligated approximately $576 million for the purchase of drones in this family from AEVEX for the Ukrainian armed forces through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI), as of August. AEVEX was shipping around 230 loitering munitions each month at the height of its deliveries, and is still delivering fresh weapons every two weeks, Trammell told TWZ. Back in April 2022, then-top Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby did say that the Phoenix Ghost drones Ukraine was getting had similar, 'but not [the] exact,' capabilities as the AeroVironment Switchblade 300 tube-launched loitering munition, which could point to the smaller Atlas or Dagger. However, officials added at that time that there are differences 'in the scope of capability for the Phoenix Ghost.' Another view of the Atlas drone. AEVEX Kirby's statement is one of a number of signs that had emerged before this year's AUSA gathering pointing to Phoenix Ghost actually being a family of drones and that Ukraine had received multiple types, something David Hambling just explored in more detail for Forbes last month. 'It’s a system of systems that varies in range and payload and type,' Skip Arny, a Vice President at Aevex Aerospace, also said about Phoenix Ghost at the AUSA show in 2022, according to Defense News. 'It’s a great example of a quick-reaction capability, and we basically got a request to put a system together, and that’s what it is.' Just this summer, pictures also began to emerge of a drone design that had not been previously observed in use by Ukraine, which independent defense analyst H.I. Sutton noted on his website Covert Shores looked similar if not identical to the AEVEX Dominator. Questions have been raised about whether these drones are actually Dominators or are a local derivative or clone of some kind given that they were reportedly recovered in Russia. The U.S. government has, at least from what is known publicly to date, placed significant restrictions on the use of American-supplied munitions against targets inside Russian territory, but various exceptions and caveats are also known to exist. Drones can stray from their intended flight paths for various reasons, too. Ukraine's arsenal of longer-range kamikaze drones has otherwise steadily expanded in the past two years, predominantly through the fielding of new domestically developed types. The wreckage of a one-way attack drone — which looks to be the Dominator, or a derivative of it — used to attack Russia earlier this year. via X Not knowing what kinds of Phoenix Ghost drones Ukraine has or how they are configured, it is also unclear what kinds of target sets the drones are being employed against. 'We haven’t really gotten into anti-tank or anti-armor, just because it’s not been a requirement for us,' AEVEX's senior director of business development Trammell told TWZ at AUSA this week. 'A lot of our aircraft, we had the base capability and then our customers came in and said, ‘This is what we want.’' Trammell's mention of 'customers' plural also raises questions about who else may have received Phoenix Ghost drones. As of June, AEVEX had reportedly delivered 4,000 drones under U.S. military contracts, well beyond the 1,800 Phoenix Ghosts publicly committed to Ukraine through USAI. It is certainly possible that the Ukrainian military has received more Phoenix Ghosts than is publicly known, but demand for various tiers of kamikaze drones is also growing globally. Earlier this year, the U.S. government approved the potential sale of more than 1,000 kamikaze drones, a mix of Switchblade 300 and ALTIUS 600M types, to Taiwan. That comes amid broader U.S. military plans to help the island turn the airspace and waters around it into a 'hellscape' full of uncrewed platforms in the event of an invasion from the mainland, as you can read more about here. The now routine use of multiple tiers of kamikaze drones in the conflict in Ukraine has helped push the Taiwan 'hellscape' plans forward and is also driving efforts across the U.S. military to acquire and field these types of uncrewed aerial systems. Last year, the Pentagon kicked off an initiative dubbed Replicator specifically with the goal of helping get thousands of new and relatively cheap uncrewed platforms with high degrees of autonomy into the hands of U.S. forces across all domains by 2025. In August, the Army awarded an especially massive contract valued at nearly $1 billion to AeroVironment for Switchblade 300 and 600-series drones, which is now the subject of a formal protest. 'There are a lot of companies in this space, so Switchblades are one of our first efforts here, but it's not going to be our last or our only one,' Doug Bush, the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology, told TWZ and other outlets at a media roundtable on the sidelines of the AUSA conference this week. 'I think you will see soon a diversity of companies getting contracts for that kind capability. It's a really healthy part of industry. We don't have, like, just one place to go.' Each branch of the U.S. armed forces — particularly the Army and Air Force — has been interested 'in some way, shape or form' in AEVEX's product line, Trammell told TWZ. Furthermore, 'as the conflict [in Ukraine] dwindles, there's other opportunities that this can go for,' she said. 'There's a lot of big programs that are looking for midsize UAS systems, and we're trying to advertise to that.' Still, the experience AEVEX has now gained from working on the now less-secretive Phoenix Ghost effort for Ukraine could give the company an important leg up as kamikaze drones continue to make their mark worldwide.

B-2 Spirits Just Sent A Very Ominous Message To Iran	The Pentagon is stating that B-2 Spirit stealth bombers, along with other U.S. forces, conducted a strike on Houthi underground weapon storage sites in Yemen. This it the first operational strike mission for the Spirit in years and the first into Yemen. It sends a very specific and powerful message that only B-2 can to the Houthi's benefactor, Iran. It also occurred on what appears to be the precipice of an unprecedented Israeli retaliation strike. As to why the B-2 was used against the Houthis, who have only rudimentary air defenses, we will address in a moment, but it was by design a very ominous and potentially historic act that might have featured the first use of an incredibly rare weapon. Even if it did not, the message was the same. The Pentagon's statement reads: 'Today, U.S. military forces, including U.S. Air Force B-2 bombers, conducted precision strikes against five hardened underground weapons storage locations in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. U.S. forces targeted several of the Houthis' underground facilities housing various weapons components of types that the Houthis have used to target civilian and military vessels throughout the region. This was a unique demonstration of the United States' ability to target facilities that our adversaries seek to keep out of reach, no matter how deeply buried underground, hardened, or fortified. The employment of U.S. Air Force B-2 Spirit long-range stealth bombers demonstrate U.S. global strike capabilities to take action against these targets when necessary, anytime, anywhere. For over a year, the Iran-backed Houthis, Specially Designated Global Terrorists, have recklessly and unlawfully attacked U.S. and international vessels transiting the Red Sea, the Bab Al-Mandeb Strait, and the Gulf of Aden. The Houthis' illegal attacks continue to disrupt the free flow of international commerce, threaten environmental catastrophe, and put innocent civilian lives and U.S. and partner forces' lives at risk. At the direction of President Biden, I authorized these targeted strikes to further degrade the Houthis' capability to continue their destabilizing behavior and to protect and defend U.S. forces and personnel in one of the world's most critical waterways. Again, the United States will not hesitate to take action to defend American lives and assets; to deter attacks against civilians and our regional partners; and to protect freedom of navigation and increase the safety and security in these waterways for U.S., coalition, and merchant vessels. We will continue to make clear to the Houthis that there will be consequences for their illegal and reckless attacks. I am grateful for the professionalism and skill of the brave American troops who took part in today's actions and who continue to stand guard in defense of our Nation.' The DoD's description of the targets is very important. 'Hardened underground weapons storage locations,' followed by declaring 'the United States' ability to target facilities that our adversaries seek to keep out of reach, no matter how deeply buried underground, hardened, or fortified.' This directly highlights the B-2's special ability to carry out unique penetrating 'bunker buster' strikes, specifically via its ability to carry the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, better known as the MOP. Although it isn't clear if this weapon was used, it's certainly possible for a number of reasons, and that is really all that matters. The MOP, weighing in around 30,000lbs, can only be carried by the B-2. Two can be lugged aloft by each of the stealth bombers at a time. These are highly specialized and prized weapons only available in relatively tiny numbers. MOP is able to penetrate deeper than any other conventional bomb on earth and is specifically designed and has been repeatedly upgraded to go after deeply buried, high-value targets, especially those in Iran. These sites include command and control centers and missile storage and launch facilities, as well as aircraft storage areas, tunneled into mountains. But above all else, the MOP's top targets would be extremely hardened sites related to Iran's nuclear program. This is a reality we have been discussing for many years and in detail. Even with the MOP, they will be a challenge to destroy, but anything short of a nuclear weapon, ground invasion, or use of an 'exotic' tactic like irradiation, the MOPs have the best shot at severely damaging these facilities and degrading their utility over the long term. Iran's Natanz nuclear site burrowed in a mountain.(PHOTO © 2023 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION) The Houthis also have high-value sites dug into mountains. They are not nearly as advanced as those found in Iran, and while hitting weak points, support areas, and entrances may degrade their utility, truly destroying them may very well necessitate the MOP's special penetrating abilities. Even if the target set didn't require it, a demonstration of MOP's capabilities — if it was indeed used — may have been a strategic messaging decision, but more about that in a moment. The Houthis are going underground. In 2019, the movement seems to have reactivated a Saleh-era underground facility at Hafa military base in Sanaa, which had been destroyed by coalition airstrikes back in 2015. (15.325075° 44.239581°) pic.twitter.com/g4Ep5CltEX&mdash; Fabian Hinz (@fab_hinz) March 14, 2021 The timing of such a strike makes perfect sense as it happened just as the tension between Israel and Iran is about to hit uncharted territory as the world awaits what is by all indications going to be a significant strike by Israel directly on Iran. Sending a very direct reminder that the U.S. has the ability to destroy extremely hardened sites with conventional weapons and it is willing to use them seems right on cue in terms of deterrence theater. This is only magnified if MOP was indeed used for the first time. In fact, MOP-related news often peculiarly pops-up during times of escalation with America's 'rogue state' foes, although a demonstration of operational use has never occurred. Regardless, striking these sites with any munitions also degrades the Houthi's long-range capabilities ahead of an Israeli operation, which is important. The B-2 also has the ability to deliver Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) with penetrating warheads in the 2,000-pound class (BLU-109), as well as, at least in the past, 5,000-pound class bunker busters, the latter being a much rarer weapon the exact status of which in the B-2's inventory is unclear. You can read more about this class of weapon's origins here and murky status here. A very early graphic from the MOP program showing the bomb able to penetrate up to 60 feet under the ground. By 2007, the weapon was reportedly capable of burrowing nearly four times deeper than this. This also offers a comparison between the 2,000lb BLU-109-equipped guided bomb and 5,000lb GBU-28. DOD via GlobalSecurity.org The B-2 is capable of carrying 16 of the 2,000lb class weapons, allowing it to 'dig down' through hardened targets that do not necessitate a MOP by having one weapon follow through the hole made by the one that just struck before it and so on. It is creative 'weaponeering' that allows for lesser bunker busters to achieve greater burrowing effects. Even the MOP could use this tactic for striking very deeply buried targets, like some of those in Iran. Otherwise disabling sites by going after entrance tunnels and other weaker, but less centralized areas may be an option. GBU-31 JDAMs equipped with BLU-109 penetrator warheads. (USAF) But if common 2,000lb bunker busters were used, why leverage the B-2, a precious asset of which only 19 exist, on targets that sit under airspace that is barely defended? There are a number of reasons for this that we already addressed after the Spirit was selected to strike targets in Libya in 2017. You can read that post here. But once again, the messaging related to the B-2 and its ability to penetrate deep into contested airspace to deliver a highly specialized weapon that threatens Iran's most guarded military and nuclear assets is the most glaring reason. We will have to wait to find out exactly what was stuck and how, but as it sits now, this mission was far more than just an attack operation to achieve a kinetic effect. It was meant to send a blindingly bright message to Iran at a critically high-risk and pivotal moment.

Command Center Stryker Teamed With Uncrewed Ground Vehicle ‘Wingm...	General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) unveiled a new Mission Command On The Move (MCOTM) concept and its supporting hardware at the Association of the United States Army's biggest annual conference (AUSA '24), which wrapped up today outside of Washington, D.C. The idea is to take an advanced command center filled with communications and a crew that can interpret critical data and make fast decisions, pack it all into a nimble armored vehicle, and push it forward toward the edge of battle along with an array of uncrewed ground vehicles (UGVs) also under its control. This concept appears to aim to accomplish a couple of key objectives. First, it makes a command and control node more nimble, protected, and thus far more survivable on a modern battlefield. Fixed command centers, which often have a major footprint and the multi-spectral signatures that go with it, are more vulnerable than ever, especially as precision-guided missile and drone technology proliferate at an alarming space. So allowing it to reposition rapidly, and even keep up with the forces it supports, is seen as an attractive capability. There is also a major logistics burden when it comes to establishing, breaking down, and repositioning traditional command centers in tents and trailers. The other is to allow this mobile C2 node to also control an array of UGVs that can work in a defensive manner, protecting the command center and friendly forces, and even in an offensive one. Seeing as the C2 node is armored, deeply networked, and highly mobile, it could stay in relatively close proximity to at least some of the UGVs it controls, allowing for line-of-sight connectivity between them. The UGVs can provide direct fire, reconnaissance, air defense, and additional transport capabilities. This kind of manned-unmanned teaming armored ecosystem is very much the direction the Army is interested in heading in the coming years. Central to this concept is the 8&#215;8 Mission Command On The Move (MCOTM) armored vehicle, which is based on the StrykerX demonstrator. This rolling battlefield management node works as a forward brain for friendly forces and a quarterback for the aforementioned UGVs even in hotly contested areas. The General Dynamics Land Systems Stryker Mission Command On The Move (MCOTM) command vehicle. (General Dynamics Land Systems) Like the StrykerX, which was unveiled at the AUSA show in 2022, the Stryker MCOTM system features hybrid-electric propulsion. This also builds on a previous StrykerQB concept that was rolled out for AUSA conference last year. Painted like a football uniform, it was displayed to show the Army 'the 'art of the possible' when it comes to using existing platforms for manned-unmanned teaming, or human-machine integration,' Breaking Defense reported at the time. The earlier StrykerQB vehicle. (General Dynamics Land Systems) The new Stryker MCOTM is another step forward in that development. With increased interior space thanks to a raised rear roof, it has room for seven soldiers. The command vehicle uses GDLS's KATALYST Next Generation Electronic Architecture (NGEA) to connect all its systems together and provide for ease of upgradability of its hardware and modification of its software. That enables the vehicle to adapt more quickly to changing tactical realities and technologies. The NGEA system offers 'cyber defense, and individual communication devices for end-to-end secure communications, at echelon,' the company states. 'Integrating innovative intra-command post communications helps substantively reduce electromagnetic signatures, enabling the MCOTM command post to 'hide in plain sight.'' Extra attention has been put on reducing the vehicle's signature beyond the radio frequency spectrum, including thermal and acoustic. The vehicle's hybrid propulsion helps with both. For self-protection, the Stryker MCOTM showcased on the showroom floor features the Iron Fist Light active protection system. The system is designed to shoot down approaching anti-tank guided missiles and other infantry anti-armor weapons, and could be used to also swat down incoming kamikaze drones and drone-launched projectiles in the near future. GDLS has shown the Stryker MCOTM paired with the newest version of the company's 8&#215;8 Multi-Utility Tactical Transport (MUTT) robotic vehicle, known as the MUTT XM, and the latest iteration of its TRX Defender, a 10-ton modular tracked robotic vehicle that can be configured to provide ground and air defense fire support. At AUSA this year, GDLS also highlighted MUTT XM as a robot dog carrier vehicle, capable of releasing and retrieving these mechanical and potentially deadly quadrupeds in forward areas. They can also be used for outer security around the MCOTM. At AUSA, the specific robot dog shown together with the MUTT XM was a Ghost Robotics Vision 60 quadrupedal UGV (Q-UGV), a design The War Zone has covered extensively in the past. This particular Vision 60 was carrying MIMIC spoofing technology from General Dynamics Mission Systems, 'providing a deployed layer of protection for the MCOTM command vehicles,' according to the company. A key part of our Mission Command on the Move (MCOTM) concept at AUSA 2024 is the MUTT XM, the newest member of our family of Multi-Utility Tactical Transport robotic vehicles.MUTT XM is bigger, faster and stronger than its predecessors and is hardened against electromagnetic… pic.twitter.com/7MLtXYW0Xm&mdash; General Dynamics Land Systems (@GD_LandSystems) October 15, 2024 The MUTT XM by itself 'is bigger, faster, and stronger than its predecessors and is hardened against electromagnetic interference,' GDLS stated in a release.

In an opposition forces exercise, the 8×8 wheeled, hybrid-electric-powered uncrewed ground vehicles (UGV) were each configured with a Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS) equipped with a 7.62mm M240 machine gun and a Javelin anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) launcher. It also had a tethered quadcopter drone with an array of video cameras allowing it to provide additional surveillance and reconnaissance capacity, as well as act as a signal relay. That extends how far the MUTT can operate from its human operators. You can see one example of that configuration in the image below. An 8&#215;8 Multi-Utility Tactical Transport (MUTT) as seen during a 2022 demonstration. (U.S. Army) TRX, which GDLS had first unveiled at the AUSA gathering in 2020, is a tracked semi-autonomous vehicle with a flat deck that can be configured in numerous ways, including for direct and indirect fire, autonomous resupply, complex obstacle breaching, counter-unmanned aerial systems (C-UAS), electronic warfare (EW), reconnaissance, and other battlefield missions. The core design was developed to meet the Army's need for a 10- to 20-ton UGV. That vehicle was the company’s submission to the Army’s Robotic Combat Vehicle-Medium (RCV-M) competition that Howe & Howe ultimately won with its M5.

(Jamie Hunter) As seen above and below, the TRX on display at AUSA this year was mocked up as a short-range air defense (SHORAD) system with faux Stinger short-range heat-seeking surface-to-air missiles, Coyote anti-drone interceptors, a 30mm automatic cannon, and a 7.62x51mm machine gun. This is an impressive and diverse loadout for a relatively small tracked vehicle. Vehicles that are capable of rebuffing drone attacks, are armored, and can keep up with frontline forces are becoming a growing priority for the U.S. Army and this is clearly a major business growth area for industry. Having just such a vehicle to protect the manned command and control Stryker that could operate detached from forward forces is also key. (Jamie Hunter) Another version of TRX we wrote about in 2021 was set up as a launch platform for 50 AeroVironment Switchblade-series loitering munitions. Such a configuration could venture forward and launch a devastating drone swarm at the command of the MCOTM.

(Joseph Trevithick) www.twz.com The Army is increasingly looking to integrate UGVs with its crewed armored formation on the battlefield. Similar to how the USAF wants its Next Generation Air Dominance manned 'fighter' to be the centerpiece of a family of systems that will be dominated by uncrewed types, working as the central C2 node 'quarterback' for these drones, GDLS is presenting a similar concept for ground operations. Moving the controller forward not only helps with connectivity and awareness, but also allows for deficiencies in autonomy to be overcome by proximity. Advances in autonomy will change those relationships over time, but this kind of on-the-move management will be important at least in the near term as the U.S. military has stressed that having humans at least somewhere 'on-the-loop' is a requisite for uncrewed platforms. As far as the MCOTM's more traditional command and control functions, those are not clear, but even possessing some of these abilities and being able to keep them on the move and forward while flanked by a protective phalanx of UGVs is an enticing concept to ponder. Another view of the Stryker MCOTM on display at this year's AUSA show. Jamie Hunter Regardless of whether this system fills this role for the Army or anyone else, the general concept behind it is something we're going to be seeing more of in the coming years.

Army’s Future Vertical Lift Tiltrotor Will Differ Significantly F...	The U.S. Army's Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) tiltrotor is shaping up to be significantly different from the V-280 Valor from which it is derived. Changes range from the design of the drive train to the fuselage layout to the arrangement of the seats inside the main cabin. The service's goal is to have the initial FLRAA configuration largely nailed down by next year and development work is already informing exploration of how the new aircraft will be used operationally. Army officials provided new details about the FLRAA program at a panel discussion today at the Association of the U.S. Army's (AUSA) main annual conference in Washington, D.C. The service picked Bell and its V-280-based design as the winner of the FLRAA competition in 2022. A so-called Critical Design Review (CDR) is expected to occur next summer ahead of the planned delivery of the first of six FLRAA prototypes in 2026. The program schedule as it exists now sees low-rate initial production of the tiltrotors starting in 2028 and units beginning to use them operationally in 2030. Bell 'To be very clear, and that's why I very rarely use the term V-280 for FLRAA, the name of the aircraft will be different, the nomenclature will be different, the changes are significant,' Army Col. Jeffrey Poquette, the head of the program on the Army side, explained at AUSA. 'The drive train has already been upsized to meet the purposes and intent for meeting our requirements.' In terms of general performance, requirements the Army previously laid out publicly for FLRAA called for a design capable of hitting a top speed of at least 250 knots (285 miles per hour), and potentially up to 280 knots (320 miles per hour), and with an unrefueled combat radius of between 200 and 300 nautical miles. In testing to date, the experimental V-280, which has been flying since 2017, has reached a top speed of over 300 knots. The stated maximum speed and range of a typical current-generation Black Hawk under normal operating conditions is around 163 knots (187.5 miles per hour) and 268 nautical miles, respectively, according to Lockheed Martin, the parent company of the helicopter's manufacturer Sikorsky. The Army has also said in the past that it wants FLRAA to be able to carry 12 passengers, 4,000 pounds, or a mix of both, internally, as well as between 10,000 pounds and 13,100 pounds of additional cargo slung underneath the fuselage. FLRAA is also expected to have the ability to carry munitions and other stores on stub wings just like Black Hawk variants and the exact configuration of sensors, antennas and other systems will need to be finalized, as well. A future special operations-focused subvariant is set to have other specialized features, too, including aerial refueling capability. FLRAA will have other notable internal and external differences compared to the V-280. 'Something as simple as, will we have cockpit doors? The answer is no. But the Valor does,' Col. Poquette added. 'We've already decided that the original [boarding] step [into the main cabin] was a little too narrow.' 'The things that matter to soldiers in the back are not drive trains or engines or rotors. What matters to them [are things like] is my seat comfortable? Does my ruck[sack] have to sit on my toes when I'm trying to get out? Am I going to trip over the guy in front of me?' the FLRAA program head continued. 'So we spend a lot of time early trying to get the insight from the people that matter to us.' Poquette highlighted experimentation utilizing a wooden FLRAA mock-up earlier this year at Wheeler Army Airfield in Hawaii earlier this year that involved personnel from the 25th Infantry Division as having provided key feedback. 'We spent a week out there with them [the members of the 25th Infantry Division], iterating on the two [internal] configurations we wanted to test. We started with one, the one actually that we thought we were going to choose with [regard to] seat configuration,' Poquette said. 'We ran the soldiers through [drills]&#8230; without any combat gear, and then we added weapons, then we added body armor, then we added MOPP gear. We timed them.' MOPP is the U.S. military's suite of Mission Oriented Protective Posture protective gear, which includes gas masks and full body suits designed to help shield soldiers from chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear hazards. MOPP gear is notoriously physically straining to wear, especially in extremely hot and humid environments. A member of the 25th Infantry Division carrying their weapon and other gear exits the FLRAA mockup during testing at Wheeler Army Airfield in Hawaii in September 2024. US Army Spc. Charles Clark 'The people that do this kind of human systems science are technical experts, We measured every soldier with giant human-sized calipers,' Poquette continued. 'We wanted to make sure we could take care of the fifth percentile soldier, the 95th percent percentile soldier. 'We ran it [the tests] at combat speed &#8230; even as the soldiers came out, they ran out, they went into the prone with their weapon, so it was as tactical as we could make it while getting the information that we need,' he added.' 'What we found out is that soldiers really liked the second configuration better,' the FLRAA program chief said. 'Why did they like it? It was more comfortable, it was faster. They weren't tripping over each other.' Work on the internal configuration is not just limited to the arrangements of the passenger seats. There is the matter of where crew chiefs and other crew members will sit, as well as the positioning of weapons for self-defense. As seen below, the mock-ups the Army used in the tests in Hawaii had a crew-operated 7.62x51mm M240H machine gun mounted in a window on the side of the fuselage similar to the arrangement on the service's existing Black Hawks. US Army Spc. Charles Clark Poquette said today that the configuration of the controls and other features in the FLRAA's cockpit will also be different compared to how things are laid out on the V-280. The Army has been conducting other similar testing with units beyond the 25th Infantry Division. Other experimentation to help lay the groundwork for the future fielding of the FLRAA is already well underway, as you can read more about here. A so-called 'virtual prototype' has been helping personnel get a more hands-on look at FLRAA even before the first real aircraft is built. 'A virtual prototype is similar to a simulator, to the average person it is a simulator, but it's a little more fidelity than that,' according to Col. Poquette. 'It really involves using the software that is going to be in the aircraft, coupling that with a model, or what we call a dynamics model, of how the aircraft flies and how it reacts to conditions and inputs.' As can be seen in the picture below from the testing involving the mock-up earlier this in Hawaii, the Army has also been using augmented reality to give personnel a more in-depth experience so they can provide better feedback. US Army Spc. Charles Clark All of the initial FLRAA user testing and experimentation is particularly important given that the FLRAA is set to be the first-ever operational tiltrotor aircraft in the U.S. Army's inventory and is expected to be a major transformational moment in its history. This will require the service's pilots, especially, to learn entirely new skills sets and concepts of operations. 'How do I do an air assault with an aircraft that's going nearly 300 knots? That's something that Army aviators have never done before&#8230; as far as I know. It's a different mindset,' Poquette explained. 'We are helicopter pilots. &#8230; it's [FLRAA] only a helicopter for like takeoff and land. That's the whole point.' 'The Marine Corps does this. The Air Force Special Operations [Command] does. So we spend a lot of time with them on the program,' he continued. 'I know there is a plan to familiarize Army rotary pilots [with tiltrotors]. We have the V-22, the V-22 is a tiltrotor. So I've already started meeting Army aviators who have experience in the V-22. I just hired an experimental test pilot who is qualified in the V-22. So we're starting to build up the familiarity with a technology that the Army is just not really using.' A US Air Force Special Operations Command CV-22 Osprey. USAF A stock picture of a US Air Force CV-22B Osprey. USAF Bell, together with Boeing, developed the V-22 Osprey, which continues to be a controversial aircraft with a complicated track record. This was underscored by a fatal crash last year that led to virtually all of those aircraft being grounded for some three months. Work is still underway to address the root causes of that mishap and get Marine, Navy, and Air Force V-22 fleets back to their prior operational tempos. The V-280 and the FLRAA derived from it are clean-sheet Bell developments that differ greatly from the Osprey, as The War Zone has explored in detail before. The Army has also previously said that it is already looking toward future FLRAA variants with new and improved capabilities. The service has long touted its key demand that FLRAA use a modular open-architecture approach as making it easier to integrate new systems and functionality onto the aircraft in the future, something that officials at AUSA reiterated today. High-fidelity modeling and other digital engineering tools are also being actively employed now to help refine the baseline FLRAA design. The U.S. military continues to put heavy emphasis on digital engineering, especially in helping to avoid potentially costly issues down the road, despite growing internal and external assessments that the value of these techniques has at least been over-hyped. 'One of the things I try to impress upon people is budgets are tight. FLRAA is expensive. It's the largest program in Army history,' Col. Poquette stressed today. 'We can't afford to make a big mistake. &#8230; we can't afford to build the wrong thing. We can't build four or eight prototypes that miss the mark on the thing that's important to the Army.' US Army soldiers 'board' a FLRAA mock-up at Redstone Arsenal in Alabama. US Army Program Executive Office, Aviati As of this year, the estimated total development cost for FLRAA is approximately $652 million, according to the Government Accountability Office. It could ultimately cost the Army around $70 billion to also acquire as many as 2,000 of the tiltrotors and sustain them across decades of expected service life. Tiltotor aircraft development, in general, has historically involved significant risk and FLRAA's ongoing development comes as expected future battlefield realities also continue to evolve. If all goes according to plan now, the Army will have largely finalized all the changes to its future FLRAA tilt-rotors from the V-280 design by the middle of next year, a key step forward toward getting the transformational aircraft into production and operational service.

Leonardo DRS Gives Details On Its Directed-Energy Counter-Drone S...	The War Zone met up with Leonardo DRS’ Ed House and Blue Halo’s Trip Ferguson at the Association of the United States Army’s biggest annual symposium, AUSA ‘24, which is currently underway in Washington, D.C. to get all the details on the new Counter-Uncrewed Aerial Systems Directed Energy (C-UAS DE) Stryker. You can read our initial report on the armored vehicle that is bristling with counter-drone capabilities here, but House and Ferguson put much more color on the canvas for us in terms of exactly what their creation is capable of and where it will sit in a forces’ air defense force structure. Check it out in the video posted at the top of the story. Background: The new C-UAS DE Stryker is armed with a 26-kilowatt version of the LOCUST laser directed energy weapon from BlueHalo, installed on a retractable mount. It’s also equipped with laser-guided 70mm rockets, a 30mm XM914 automatic cannon that fires proximity burst shells, an M240 machine gun, a potent counter-drone electronic warfare suite, radars, electronic surveillance measures, and other sensors and communications gear. Combined, it’s a feature-packed, multi-layer, counter-drone-optimized, short-range air defense battery that can spot, track, and defeat drones — both kinetically and non-kinetically. All of this is packed into a fast-moving armored vehicle that can easily keep up with the troops it is tasked with protecting. The U.S. Army is looking to significantly grow its short-range air defense capabilities in the coming years, especially to counter the ballooning threat from drones, and the service is specifically interested in directed energy options. Leonardo DRS led a team that developed this unique Stryker variant that included seven other partners – BlueHalo, EOS Defense Systems USA, Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems, Arnold Defense, AMPEX, and Digital Systems Engineering. It took this eclectic consortium just eight months from design, build, and test, to culminate in a live fire exercise at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico that resulted in multiple drones being swatted out of the sky. Now, after unveiling their creation at AUSA ‘24, C-UAS DE Stryker is heading to more trials.	https://www.twz.com/sponsored-content/leonardo-drs-gives-details-on-its-directed-energy-counter-drone-stryker	2024-10-16T12:09:16-07:00	https://www.twz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ldrs-ls-stryker-atemrtc-3034-edited-copy.jpg?quality=85
Aerovironment’s New P550 Flies Five Hours On A Charge, Drops Two-...	AeroVironment on Monday unveiled its new drone that can tote weapons and conduct surveillance for up to five hours on a single charge as the company vies for a spot in the Army’s Long-Range Reconnaissance program. The P550, a highly modular battery-powered unmanned aerial system that can take off and land vertically and is able to carry up to 15 pounds of munitions and sensors, made its debut at the Association of the U.S. Army’s annual meeting in Washington. It’s a fresh entrant in a fast-paced competition that looks to improve soldiers’ real-time battlefield awareness at relatively low cost. 'There are things that fly as long, there are things that carry as much, but there's nothing that does both of that … without being fueled in some manner,' Product Line Manager Cris Cornell said Monday. 'There's nothing on the market performing like that in this space.' Soldiers already use small drones like AeroVironment’s hand-launched RQ-11 Raven for battlefield recon. But the LRR program — part of a broader effort to expand the Army’s arsenal of small drones capable of operating at various altitudes and ranges — promises to bring on a new generation of easily transportable drones that can strike targets while relaying combat data back to troops. The reusable P550 builds on the company’s Raven and Puma drones but adds VTOL capability and room for heavier payloads. Measuring about 17 feet wide, 9 feet long and weighing up to 55 pounds, the Group 2 UAS is designed to be a light lift on the battlefield, easy to assemble and simple to operate and upgrade. That wingspan allows the P550 to ferry multiple weapons and sensors at once, in an expansion of capability over AeroVironment’s existing designs. Rachel Cohen/TWZ The war in Ukraine has proven that the U.S. must adopt a strike role for its growing arsenal of small drones to remain lethal and relevant, Cornell said. 'You’ve got to be able to carry stuff — and not just stuff, you’ve got to be able to carry munitions,' Cornell said. The P550 can fly with the GPS-guided Shryke, a munition weighing less than 2.5 pounds developed by L3Harris and Corvid Technologies; Cornell said the company is exploring other options as well. The display at AUSA showed the drone’s fuselage outfitted with a surveillance payload, a signals-intelligence payload and a communications payload to demonstrate its ability to handle multiple missions compared to its predecessors. Rachel Cohen/TWZ Each aircraft can automatically recognize and catagorize targets, freeing up soldiers who would otherwise sift through imagery and other data for hours each day, and transmit that information via data link. It can also save its findings for later in case enemy jamming prevents it from sending the data in real time or for when emissions control is critical to survival. As the data link market has expanded, it’s become more feasible to design a drone that can connect anywhere — unlike the P550’s predecessors and older legacy systems, said Trace Stevenson, AeroVironment’s senior vice president of uncrewed systems. That relies on a modular open systems approach that aims to keep today’s UAS flexible in combat and could stop it from becoming obsolete in a matter of months or a handful of years. AeroVironment in April announced it had partnered with Parry Labs to design the P550’s software and plug-and-play mission systems. 'It's radio-agnostic, payload-agnostic and [ground control station]-agnostic,' Stevenson said. 'We have the common standards that allow the customer to determine what they want to put on the platform. As technology evolves, it'll be able to incorporate any of those … battery packs, payloads, ground control stations going forward.' That’s another lesson learned from Ukraine, Cornell said: '[The battlefield] changes so fast, and you have to have your system set up to be able to adapt to it.' Aerovironment Soldiers don’t need tools to assemble or disassemble the P550; the drone breaks down into three cases that can be tossed on the back of a Joint Light Tactical Vehicle or packed up as part of a larger pallet of equipment. Battalions can be 'up and flying in under 10 minutes and have eyes on top of them out to 40 km-plus range' to scout out a route ahead, watch enemy movement and more, Cornell said. 'We can do searches, map an area, find out where all the targets are, pass those targets to different elements,' he said. Rachel Cohen/TWZ The P550 has already begun flight testing and demonstrations for potential customers. In January 2023, the Army called on industry to offer options for a drone that could vertically take off and land and collect intelligence over nearly 19 miles and at least five hours in flight. The service plans to tap two vendors to mature their designs within the next few months before picking a winner, Stevenson said. Budget documents project it will begin buying the aircraft in fiscal 2027. The Army looks to buy upward of 600 drones for LRR, Cornell said. Soldiers could use a few in tandem to monitor a larger area, but aren’t likely to deploy them in groups of dozens at a time, he added. Officials across the military want to buy legions of drones, large and small, to grow the number of eyes in the sky and multiply their strike capability while sparing fewer dollars to replace a more advanced aircraft if it goes down. Stevenson said the company is preparing to build thousands of P550s each year. The AeroVironment reps declined to answer how much the UAS costs per unit.

Shield AI Looks To Unleash Its Hivemind Autonomy Software On Mult...	Artificial Intelligence (AI) is touching our lives in varying forms every day and that is only set to accelerate. It is also becoming a massive growth sector in the defense industry. It is posited by friends and adversaries alike that whoever can possess AI supremacy will have a huge advantage on tomorrow’s battlefield. Defense contractor Shield AI has established a firm footing at the bleeding edge, using AI-infused cognitive autonomy to enhance military capability. The company has developed its own family of small quadcopters that use its AI algorithms to efficiently sweep buildings for threats, and its larger drone known as V-BAT that can launch vertically, transition to forward flight, and operate as part of an automated swarming team. Shield AI says its autonomy is designed to be sufficiently versatile to be platform agnostic, meaning that it can be scaled and implemented across an infinite number of different platforms, and not just those in its own stable. NATO defines autonomy as a system's ability to function without outside intervention based on acquired knowledge and situational awareness. Within this, there are two main types when it comes to applying AI to military weapon systems: platform and mission autonomy. Platform autonomy focuses on self-management tasks like flight, navigation, and communication, as well as handling functions such as takeoff, landing, and fault detection. Mission autonomy, however, is more advanced, enabling systems to execute complex tasks, make tactical decisions, and seamlessly coordinate with other systems in dynamic environments. Shield AI's V-BAT drone employs Hivemind autonomy. Shield AI The War Zone sat down with Shield AI’s vice president of engineering for Hivemind, Christian Gutierrez, who is in charge of autonomy engineering and Shield AI’s vision of steadily expanding through integration on an increasing variety of military platforms. TWZ: Before we dive into Shield AI’s autonomy, and specifically your Hivemind product, can you outline your background and technical specializations that you bring to Shield AI? Gutierrez: Well, I started my career as an avionics technician in the U.S. Air Force, working on F-117 Nighthawks and then F-16 Vipers that I deployed with to Iraq back in 2005. I also worked command and control, and battle management for NORAD [North American Aerospace Defense Command] in the Homeland defense alert mission. I then joined Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works as an embedded software engineer working on a critical development program for future-generation aircraft and ground systems. That work included a lot of development testing in that realm before I transitioned to human space flight and deep space missions with my work being focused on software and navigation, learning about the hostility of deep space. Then I became the chief of systems engineering for a family of hypersonic missiles. In that role, I led electrical mechanical ordnance propulsion and the whole lifecycle of the systems. That program ran from inception, through capture, design development, and multiple flight tests for many customers including the U.S. Army and the Navy. All of that experience led me to my current role with Shield AI and our vision of deploying our AI [artificial intelligence] solution across a host of platforms and domains. Right now we’re focused on the air segment, but we're already growing and scaling to expand into different domains such as maritime. We see our success in this industry surrounding our ability to develop the capability to suit the varying needs of different warfighters. TWZ: Can you give us your take on the expansion of autonomy in the military space and explain Shield AI’s approach to mission autonomy, and the opportunities this creates. Gutierrez: When I was at Lockheed Martin – as a platform provider – we started touching on the early phases of what we call platform autonomy, so for example, an autopilot with enhanced features. Since that time a clear bifurcation between platform autonomy and mission autonomy has developed. Think of the latter as a valuable blend of a mission planner and a pilot. Shield AI’s Hivemind autonomy can help companies that excel in developing and building platforms to push the envelope through the employment of mission autonomy. There has to be maturity in both the platform and the autonomy so that we can collectively execute this successfully. In terms of challenges, we need alignment and standards to be fully established around autonomy, much like the automotive industry has done. That will allow us to make aligned progress ahead of our adversaries. At a high level, we think there is industry consensus on the split between mission and platform autonomy. We are working with industry partners to promote understanding of where this lies in terms of defining those levels of autonomy. At Shield AI we are sending a strong message around establishing and maintaining stringent industry standards. We know what they are for automotive, and leaders of AI and autonomy, and the world's leading defense contractors, are now working together to define the standards for our industry. Shield AI is focused on building trust with our customers and developing relationships. That is formed around clearly understanding concepts of operations, understanding the operational needs of different theaters, and understanding the limitations of technology that currently exists. Then we can start to help advance those technologies with our technology. Success in the defense industry is relatively straightforward – it’s the ability to develop and deliver for the warfighter. So first you have to understand what it is the warfighter needs. For that, Shield AI has recruited industry experts to help us shape our operational analysis and our understanding of exactly what is needed. It’s then about having the required expertise to take it through development, integration, and testing. We also need to be very direct with how we regulate all of this and ensure we have the right certification and standards in place. TWZ: Could you share examples of mission autonomy in action? Any real-world wins that demonstrate the effectiveness of your autonomy software and how these successes have shaped your strategy? Gutierrez: Mission autonomy is real – this isn’t theory or PowerPoint. Our technical approach is informed by our experiences with Hivemind, which started out in our small Nova quadcopter drones from 2018. This was years before most people had even heard of mission autonomy. Since then we've been scaling up to Group 3 unmanned air vehicles such as V-BAT and we're doing it seamlessly thanks to how we have developed our Hivemind software stack, which was developed from the outset to be extensible and modular. Our software stack is about perception, cognition, and action. We perceive something, we identify it, then we take action. Hivemind runs through our V-BAT unmanned system, and it has been proven in projects such as the X-62A VISTA [Variable-stability In-flight Simulator Test Aircraft] where we were in complete control of maneuvering an F-16 fighter and showcasing that we could go head-to-head with crewed fighters in dogfights. The X-62A VISTA used Hivemind autonomy to fly the aircraft – a modified F-16. Shield AI We've got several flight tests that we are currently running, including showcasing operations in denied environments. That’s exercising our state estimation algorithms – which is about aggregating data from various sensors to establish where the platform is at in terms of state, so the platform can continue its mission. We also recently completed live fly testing with two Kratos MQM-178 Firejets and two crewed chase aircraft. That testing was about proving the ability to operate what we call intelligent mass, that means crewed and uncrewed platforms coming together and breaking apart at will. That was a huge accomplishment in a first-of-its-kind test. The team is extraordinarily excited about that because we are developing and maturing our technology and it's a huge win at the Group 5 unmanned level. You can read more about this here. TWZ: Can you explain how Hivemind can support enhancements in different platforms? Gutierrez: It goes back to that bifurcation of platform autonomy and mission autonomy. In the military aviation world, the platforms have to fly. But they also have to accomplish a mission, and that's where we come in – where our Hivemind autonomy stack can accomplish a mission. For example, military combat platforms typically have a set of sensors and a feed from those sensors. So, they might need to locate a target. We take those inputs and use AI to make decisions. The decisions being made can be as complex as working out a location or finding an object or target. When we talk about our AI in air platforms, the natural immediate thought is that it's a pilot. That’s right in part, because yes, the AI is flying the aircraft, but that is only a very small part of what you're doing. It's actually the mission side of it that's more of a critical area. You're relying on the platform autonomy to fly the aircraft, and the mission autonomy is telling it to bank and maneuver and climb, etc, to achieve the mission objectives. On the VISTA program we were closer to the control part, the stick controls and things like that to actually fly the actual airplane. But that’s not really the environment we are focused on, it’s much more about the mission autonomy. We aren’t building a bespoke solution that only meets the needs of one platform, and we definitely don’t want it to be locked down in that way. We need to offer modularity, the ability to scale across different platforms in any class or group, adaptability, and interoperability. We need to be able to scale across maritime, space, missile defense, you name it, applying government standards of open architecture so we can operate within anybody's environment via a set of tooling. That means you can generate an AI pilot for example, and we can license that tool suite so a customer can either maintain what we generated for them or develop their own AI for whatever segment or platform they have in mind. A platform manufacturer can come to us as world renowned experts in AI and software development and we can work with them to help develop their own solution for their fleet of aircraft. So, we get away from that vendor lock situation by being open and able to integrate on any system or within any business model. We essentially license our software to them and then work as a partner. This way they get full access to the system, and they are able to do some development themselves. The U.S. government really wants to show that suppliers are integrating with a host of industry partners and that you can deliver a product that’s not solely controlled and owned by the prime contractor. A way of doing that is to expose the interfaces to ensure that everyone has access. That's exactly what we do with our solution. Our bread and butter is the underlying algorithms that generate that AI effect, and it can then be customized as required to meet needs and missions. Shield AI recently completed highly-successful tests with its AI embedded in Kratos Firejets. Shield AI TWZ: What are the key factors that differentiate Shield AI from competitors, especially in terms of your technology? Gutierrez: You have reference architecture, which is the pilot. The core reference implementation is the Intellectual Property [IP], which is all the underlying algorithms, then you have the enterprise, that’s the tooling. Our middleware strategy with industry compliance and modular design enables rapid customization. Having middleware allows you to integrate in a host of hardware environments. It doesn't mean you account for all of them, and that’s why we're also investing in our own computer hardware so that we can offer to work in their hardware environment, or we can bring our own computer box. That middleware is critical, and we've invested in it over the years. We can adapt to any platform with any sensor and with any mission with ease, and we can do it ourselves, or we can enable that provider to do it themselves. That's a huge differentiator. We can show a customer how to do one example and then they can take over and continue to execute while we provide support. That approach seems to really resonate with the customer. The goal is to be able to integrate Hivemind into any hardware environment that a platform provider has. If the environment isn't suitable, for example it doesn't have enough compute, or it doesn't have the power, then we can provide our own ‘compute box.’ We can speak whatever protocol the platform might have, be it MIL-STD-1553 or whatever, there's all kinds of protocols on board these platforms. So having a compute box that can speak to many interfaces is hugely important and just the kind of detail that we think through to ensure that it is a low bar to entry with platform providers. We talk a lot about reinforcement learning and the AI technologies and techniques that we use to conduct a mission. How we learn from the mission, adapt it and then redeploy it onto a platform within hours. Then there's the stack of the cognition, perception, and action, which is tied to our task and behavior model which mimics human behavior. With the VISTA tests, and what we have just seen with Firejet, we are leaps ahead of everyone else. With Firejet, the customer said that was the best flight performance they’d seen. The maneuverability, everything, just went phenomenally well. We know that it is the best, but we also know the hard work that went into it and our competitors have a lot to do to keep up with us, but competition keeps us on the edge of our seats. TWZ: Modern flight tests are very rigorous. Do you see autonomy working in the same boundaries or do you foresee a need to rewrite the rulebook to be more agile? Gutierrez: I think the rulebook is being rewritten as we speak. We are at the bleeding edge and forcing regulators to catch up. Shield AI holds unique expertise in this industry, and our experts are able to explain the intent and then work with customers to shape test plans and meet criteria. We are hiring industry experts especially in mission planning airworthiness certification, which is a huge piece for us – managing FAA regulations, safety boards, and those kinds of areas. Also, professionals with a test and integration background, plus experts in modeling and simulation as well as operational analysis. Shield AI experts are working closely with the military and other industry partners. Shield AI The operational analysis, integration, and test modeling and simulation create that trifecta needed to successfully navigate operational test and evaluation and to build trust with your customer. You must have that pedigree of testing, especially for that kind of automated testing. It’s imperative that we show our customers that we understand how to develop and integrate with complex weapons systems. We are also talking about the definitions of the levels of autonomy, which hasn't been formally written down, so it’s difficult for certification boards to say whether you meet the intent and criteria. We are defining this and applying the tried and trusted methods that we're adopting. I mean, we don’t see a need to reinvent the wheel, just automate it. Adapting to what we see in the field is critical, making fixes, then getting it through testing fast. We must shorten that timeline. Historically, it’s taken months before a patch is deployed, and we want to get these upgrades out into the field within hours. We need to be audacious. TWZ: How do you envision Shield AI’s technologies and products complementing those of prime contractors or aircraft builders? Gutierrez: Traditionally, having a gap in capability leads to investing a ton of money to develop a very exquisite system. Once that system is finally operational, it may no longer be relevant. We've wrapped up the war in the Middle East and now we have a problem in the South China Sea, so a platform designed for one may no longer be effective for the other. That’s where Shield AI comes in and makes a weapon system more effective. For example, we can increase range. That’s not fuel range, but operating range, mission effectiveness range, advancing capabilities and technologies. We are not pitching our capabilities as a threat to industry, but as a vital partner to success. The bigger the partner and platform portfolio, the more powerful Shield AI’s value proposition becomes through the embedding of our Hivemind software. For example, the need to address stand-off in the South China Sea when a platform cannot penetrate. We can look at the set of problems around that penetration and develop a set of technologies to help overcome deficiencies in maybe something that has changed since the original requirements were set. Traditionally, this might necessitate a new aircraft or a different block upgrade, which equates to billions of dollars of investment. Shield AI can assess the issue and potentially help with a solution. It’s not easy to just drop in new hardware, but our compute hardware is super lightweight and small and it is absolutely able to make these more intelligent systems. TWZ: Can you explain how Shield AI autonomy can enhance platforms right now. Gutierrez: We talk about coming in as a software upgrade not hardware. They are currently limited to platform autonomy because they don’t have the technology to do the mission autonomy. Particularly with regard to unmanned systems, it's critically important to be able to push the envelope there. If you think of crewed aircraft such as the F-35, for example, a Shield AI solution could be configurable as a co-pilot. There’s a lot of things we can do to help protect the asset. You could enable cognitive behavior within your electronic warfare sensor suite. There might be signals that are not recognized, that haven't been registered before and you need to come back and send the signal out to somebody to process and then have a new jamming effect drawn up and then implemented. We could automatically update the mission data in flight, there and then, and the system would learn from it. That could continue exponentially. Shield AI says that it's autonomy could be used in the F-35, for example. Jamie Hunter TWZ: Looking forward, how do you see Shield AI’s approach to mission autonomy evolving? Gutierrez: We're trailblazing here and frankly ahead of what people can wrap their head around. We have to demonstrate our credentials, and we have to do all this ethically and partner with the right agencies. When we talk about working at the edge, we are talking about no communications – it’s the platform and its mission autonomy. So, how do you ensure it’s still doing the right things that you wanted it to do? We're currently working through that with a really slick solution that ensures there's essentially a third voter. Sort of like an arbitrator. It’s something that we're actively working on right now. It’s going to build great trust with our customers. It's not even the way it will monitor and ensure the location we want our platform to be at, it’s about keeping what we're doing safe and it's within the boundaries of the mission profile. TWZ: In terms of mission technology that’s developing fast, I’d assume Ukraine is a big focus right now? Gutierrez: We're keeping a close eye on what's going on there. We're seeing firsthand some of the technologies that are being employed by the Russians. The agility and speed to adapt and iterate has been shown to be critical, particularly in denied environments. It’s easy to see how you might initially enter an environment like that and operate effectively. But maybe just a few days later the adversary has adapted to throw your sensors off. You need to adapt, evolve, and that’s where we can help. But you can’t teach a system that’s not there. If you don’t have the hardware in the first place you cannot have an effect. That’s why we are not a threat to the platform, we're a partner capability enhancer. TWZ: In the next five years, what do you think will surprise people about developments in autonomy for aircraft, and perhaps other types of platforms. Gutierrez: We are assimilating a body of industry experts, and we've got fantastic leads and opportunities that will help us to address gaps in maritime operations, for example, be that surface or subsurface or within the space domain, within missile defense. There are legacy systems out there that need life extension, that next-generation capability and we are actively expanding into those market spaces. The definition of what cognitive autonomy is will be fully defined, and we will be at the bleeding edge of it. We have also been very thoughtful about awarding certification and about safety. We've also been very thoughtful about how we integrate into existing or developing platforms with our own compute hardware or our middleware. So, you're going to see Shield AI proliferate across many domains. Cognitive autonomy will become more understood and widely embraced, so in five years if we’re only talking about aircraft flying with our autonomy I would be surprised!
