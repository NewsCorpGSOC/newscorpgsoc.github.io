Our Best Look So Far Inside Israeli’s Once Secretive 707 Tankers	The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have provided an even better look at the previously secretive remote vision system that is central to the operation of the Israeli Air Force’s critical Boeing 707 tanker fleet. TWZ has previously looked at this system — used by the boom operator to see what is happening at the rear of the aircraft while connecting the boom with the receiving aircraft — but the actual operator interface has, as far as we know, never been seen in such detail. View this post on Instagram A post shared by צה&#034;ל - צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) The new imagery comes from an official IDF video that features the 707 tanker — known locally by the Hebrew name Re’em, meaning oryx — and which was published to coincide with its 60th anniversary. The footage shows details including the fuel tanks in the cargo hold and the boom. The internal tanks can also be removed, allowing the aircraft to be reconfigured as transports, including with airliner-style passenger seating. Most interesting, though, is the boom operator’s position, with the remote vision system, or RVS interface. Fuel tanks in the cargo hold of an Israeli 707 tanker. IDF screencap This includes control sticks on either side and a foot-operated communications system, meaning the boomer’s hands are kept free to operate the console. The boomer’s screen is relatively large and surrounded by what appear to be exclusively analog instruments — a reflection of the overall age of the installation. We got a previous view of the screen of the remote vision system back in September 2024, in a video showing portions of a long-range strike mission flown against Houthi targets in Yemen. You can read that earlier analysis here. A view of the Re’em’s RVS provided by the IDF in a video released in September 2024. IDF screencap In July of the same year, after the 707 supported another long-range IAF raid on Yemen, the IDF released video from the RVS camera feed itself, although not of the actual boomer interface that controls the system. Overall, the console used on the Israeli 707 makes a fascinating comparison with the much more modern iteration of the same technology that’s now used on the U.S. Air Force’s KC-46 Pegasus. Of course, the specific technology used in the KC-46 has gained something close to notoriety, since the complex Remote Vision System (RVS) has proven to be a particular source of problems for that program. Cameras for the Israeli RVS in the tail of the 707 tanker. IDF screencap As we can see in the IDF video, as in the KC-46, the Israeli 707 boom operator goes about their work from a station in the main cabin, aided by an array of cameras at the rear of the aircraft that feeds into the RVS. A key difference in the KC-46 is the use of a hybrid 2D/3D system, requiring the operators to wear special glasses, whereas the 707 RVS has just a single monitor. Boom operators sit at their workstations wearing their specialized glasses in the main cabin of a KC-46A. U.S. Air Force As we discussed in our previous coverage of the Israeli RVS, it’s nothing short of surprising that this earlier concept has been serving for decades in a very high-stakes role, while the U.S. Air Force still waits for a revised system in the KC-46: 'Perhaps the most surprising facet of this is that Israel developed and fielded a remote vision system that seems to function without any lingering difficulties, and did so many years ago, while the U.S. version used in the KC-46 is still mired in delays. We still don’t know exactly how bad the teething of this older Israeli system was when it was introduced many years ago. Another modern remote vision system has meanwhile also been developed and introduced by Airbus, on the A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT).'

U.S. Air Force Whatever the story of the Israeli RVS, its days in service now appear to be numbered — ironically, the 707 will be superseded by the KC-46. An initial eight of these aircraft have been ordered and they are almost certain to be provided with the next-generation RVS installed — the 2.0 version of the system is expected to be delivered starting in April 2026. While Israel might decide to continue operating the 707s for a while, to supplement the KC-46, these are, by now, aging platforms, and the most worn-out examples are already being retired.

Boeing As for the IAF 707 Re’em fleet, this began to enter service in 1979, with then-newer 707-300 airframes replacing the previous 707-100s. These aircraft were bought from commercial airlines before being modified locally for aerial refueling. The conversion was done by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI). Additional airframes were acquired and upgraded to tankers as recently as the 2010s. In addition to vital aerial refueling, which is fundamental for allowing the Israeli Air Force to conduct long-range strikes, the 707 also has an important role as a command-and-control station and communications node. The aircraft carries a satellite communications suite to provide critical, secure beyond-line-of-sight comms with appropriately equipped tactical aircraft like the F-15 and F-16 and command centers far away. This is also highly important for long-range strike operations. An Israeli Air Force Boeing 707 tanker demonstrates refueling hookups with F-15 fighters over Hatzerim Air Base. JACK GUEZ/AFP via Getty Images Today, Israel is understood to have no more than seven 707 tankers in service, meaning that these assets are more precious to the service than ever. As Israel moves toward phasing out these enduring aircraft, we may well start to learn more about its operations and some of its more sensitive technologies, like the RVS, that have helped it remain the backbone of the Israeli Air Force’s long-range strike capabilities since the early 1980s.

Ukraine Launches New Offensive In Russia’s Kursk Region	As Ukrainian forces mount a new offensive in Russia’s Kursk region, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday said that success in this region would improve Kyiv’s bargaining position in any future ceasefire negotiations. This new effort takes place as Donald Trump is set to return to the White House in two weeks, giving both sides an increasing sense of urgency to gain ground ahead of any future bargaining the new administration might undertake. Ukraine's renewed effort in Kursk also comes as Russia, which claimed it captured a key village in eastern Ukraine, continues to gain ground there. '&#8230;the Ukrainians themselves are trying to make sure that they have that strong hand,' Blinken told reporters in Seoul, South Korea on Monday. 'Their position in Kursk is an important one, because certainly it’s something that would factor into any negotiation that may come about in the coming year.' His assessment mirrors what Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said back in September about Kursk being a 'bargaining chip.' WATCH!!! Blinken says Ukraine position in Kursk 'important' for negotiations'Their position in Kursk is an important one because certainly it’s something that would factor in any negotiation that may come about in the coming year,' Blinken told reporters in Seoul. Alex Raufoglu (@ralakbar) January 6, 2025 Ukraine first invaded Kursk in August but after initial success there, lost about half the territory it gained. It is unclear how much ground Ukraine has gained in the new Kursk offensive. Initial indications were that Ukraine’s surprise attack achieved some early success. However, the Russian Defense Ministry and Russian Telegram channels suggest that Ukraine’s advances have been blunted. The War Zone cannot independently verify these battlefield claims. The new Ukrainian offensive has pushed out in at least three directions, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) stated in its latest assessment. Kyiv's forces have pushed east and southeast of Sudzha, its main base of operations in Kursk, while the also advancing northwest toward the town of Korenevo. Ukrainian forces 'made tactical advances on January 5,' ISW noted. 'Russian sources claimed that Ukrainian forces conducted multiple roughly company-sized mechanized assaults in the Berdin-Novosotnitsky direction (northeast of Sudzha) in three waves of attack using roughly a battalion's worth of armored vehicles. Russian sources claimed that Ukrainian forces also intensified offensive operations in the direction of Leonidovo (southeast of Korenevo) and conducted a reinforced platoon-sized mechanized assault near Pushkarnoye (east of Sudzha).' Geolocated footage published on January 5 indicated that Ukrainian forces 'advanced in fields southwest and south of Berdin and entered the southern part of the settlement,' ISW maintained.

Russian forces, however, also gained some ground in a counterattack, ISW posited. 'Russian forces also advanced southeast of Sudzha and counterattacked against intensified Ukrainian attacks southeast of Korenevo and north of Sudzha on January 5,' ISW stated. 'Geolocated footage published on January 5 shows that Russian forces advanced in western and southern Makhnovka (just southeast of Sudzha).'

'To break through, the Ukrainian Armed Forces covered the area with powerful electronic warfare systems, making it difficult for our UAVs to operate,' Operation Z suggested. 'It is expected that the Ukrainian Armed Forces may attack in other areas as well.' 'The enemy uses IMRs, clears roads and drives in armored fighting vehicles and infantry fighting vehicles,' the Two Majors Telegram channel claimed. 'Widespread Russian concern over Russia's ability to respond to improved Ukrainian EW technology and long-range strike capabilities indicates that Russian forces may be struggling to quickly adapt to Ukrainian battlefield innovations,' ISW reported. 'Reports that Ukrainian forces are using long-range fires to interdict Russian rear areas and EW to degrade Russian drones in support of Ukrainian mechanized advances indicate that Ukrainian forces operating in Kursk are employing more effective combined arms tactics.' A number of Russian channels say that Ukraine has began an offensive operation from near Sudzha towards Bolshoye Soldatskoye in Kursk oblast with armored vehicles. They say Ukrainian EW has been effective against their UAVs and that Ukrainian units cleared mines overnight.… pic.twitter.com/jfllbH9kpj&mdash; Rob Lee (@RALee85) January 5, 2025 In his evening address on Monday, Zelensky claimed Russia has taken heavy losses in Kursk. 'Today marks exactly five months since the start of our actions in the Kursk region, and we continue to maintain a buffer zone on Russian territory, actively destroying Russian military potential there,' he said. 'Since the beginning of the Kursk operation, the enemy has already lost over 38,000 troops in this area alone, including approximately 15,000 irrecoverable losses. The Russians have deployed their strong units to the Kursk region. Soldiers from North Korea are involved there. What’s important is that the occupier cannot currently redirect all this force to other directions, in particular the Donetsk, Sumy, Kharkiv, or Zaporizhzhia regions.' Meanwhile, the Russian MoD claimed it had halted the Ukrainian advances. 'The attempt of the Ukrainian Armed Forces to break through was thwarted by the decisive actions of the Sever Group of Forces' units supported by aviation and artillery,' the MoD stated on Telegram Monday. 'As a result of the fire damage, the enemy's main forces were neutralized on the outskirts of Berdin area.' As we have previously reported, Russia’s defense of Kursk has been aided by the influx of about 12,000 North Korean troops. So far, nearly a third of those troops have been killed or wounded, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told American podcaster Lex Fridman in a wide-ranging interview that aired Saturday. 'North Korea sent 12 thousand of its soldiers, 3800 are already wounded or dead,' Zelenskyy tells Fridman in his interview But he also issues a warning, watch pic.twitter.com/7bcLojFkEW&mdash; Euromaidan Press (@EuromaidanPress) January 6, 2025 On Monday, Blinken doubled down on the Biden administration’s assertions that there is a quid pro quo between Moscow and Pyongyang taking place, an arrangement we have written about in the past. 'What we’re seeing is not only the provision of artillery, ammunition, and troops by North Korea to Russia – forced aggression against Ukraine – but we are seeing collaboration, support coming in the other direction,' Blinken avowed. 'Russia is already providing military equipment to the DPRK. It’s providing training. We believe that it has the intent to share space and satellite technology with the DPRK, and that concern is very much a focus that not only the United States but also the Republic of Korea and Japan are bringing to bear – and very much part of our conversations.' Ukraine’s new Kursk push comes as Russia claims it captured the tactically important eastern Ukrainian town of Kurakhove in the Donetsk region. Sitting astride the N-15 highway, the settlement is just south of a mile-wide stretch of the Vovcha River and supports the movement of troops and materiel in the region. As such, it is a bulwark on a Russian advance toward Pokrovsk about 20 miles to the north. Ukraine’s military command in the east did not comment on the Russian claim that Kurakhove had fallen. However, 'soldiers fighting in the area, and a local Ukrainian military official, said when reached by phone that while there were pockets of resistance in the factories on the outskirts, the town was essentially lost,' The New York Times reported. Today, the Russian Defence Ministry said its forces had seized the Ukrainian town of Kurakhove in Donetsk Region after several months of heavy fighting there. pic.twitter.com/Ppe3wa5N93&mdash; Will Vernon (@BBCWillVernon) January 6, 2025 The battles in Kursk and Kurakove played out against the backdrop of the looming presidency of Donald Trump, who has promised to quickly end the war. Though the president-elect has yet to provide any specifics, Zelensky said he is confident Trump can deliver on that pledge. 'I now see that when I talk about something with Donald Trump, whether we meet in person or we just have a call, all the European leaders always ask, how was it?' Zelensky said during his three-hour podcast interview with Fridman. 'This shows the influence of Donald Trump, and this has never happened before with an American President, I tell you, from my experience, this also gives you confidence, you know, that he can stop this war.'

You can read more about that in our deep dive here. Russia is not amenable to that, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov explained last month. 'Judging from numerous leaks and Donald Trump’s interview with Time magazine on December 12, their idea is to suspend hostilities along the line of contact and transfer responsibility for confrontation with Russia to the Europeans,' Lavrov told the Russian official TASS news outlet. 'We are not happy, of course, with the proposals made by members of the Trump team to postpone Ukraine’s admission to NATO for 20 years and to station British and European peacekeeping forces in Ukraine.' We will learn more in the coming days about the success of Zelensky's latest Kursk gambit and whether any increased deployment of troops and equipment there further weakens his forces' defense of the east. Beginning Jan. 20, when Trump is inaugurated, both sides will learn more about what he will do to try and end this full-on war, nearing its third anniversary.

Taiwan Coast Guard Blames Chinese-Owned Ship For Cutting Undersea...	A Chinese-owned vessel is suspected of having severed an undersea cable off the Taiwanese coast recently, according to authorities on the island. Taiwan’s coast guard requested that the cargo ship return to shore for an investigation, but it eventually continued its passage. Last Friday’s incident is the latest to have affected Taiwanese cables and is part of a pattern of similar events that have also occurred recently around Europe. The international fiber-optic telecom cable was cut early Friday morning, around 7:51 a.m., near Taiwan’s Keelung Harbor. The Trans-Pacific Express cable belongs to the Taiwanese government-run Chunghwa Telecom, which connects East Asia with the U.S. West Coast. According to Chunghwa, communication could be rerouted via other cables, with services experiencing minimal disruption. In what might be a #China grey zone warfare tactic against #Taiwan a Cameroonian registered freighter with a Chinese name SHUNXIN39 cut a Chunghwa Telecom undersea cable off Taiwan’s north coast on Saturday. This is the 21st time Chinese ships have cut Taiwanese undersea cables pic.twitter.com/yaAuec4f5v&mdash; Special Taiwan (@TaiwanSpecial) January 6, 2025 The cable in question is one of around a dozen connecting Taiwan to other countries in the region and Chunghwa says the break was caused by a vessel snagging it and dragging it across the seabed. At the center of the incident is the Shunxin-39, a Cameroon-flagged cargo ship that Taiwanese authorities say is owned by Jie Yang Trading Limited, a Hong Kong company headed by Guo Wenjie, a citizen of China. Taiwanese authorities say that seven of the crew members on board were Chinese nationals.

Vessels being registered in more than one location is not unheard of in international shipping, where the precise owners of a given ship are also frequently hard to determine. According to Col. Ray Powell, director of SeaLight, an initiative at Stanford University that tracks China’s pressure tactics aimed at Taiwan, the Shunxin-39 had actually used as many as six different AIS numbers over the past six months, and at least two different names. Ship that damaged #Taiwan's submarine cable seems to have operated under at least 2 names (Shunxing39 & Xingshun39), 2 flags (Camaroon & Tanzania) & 6 Maritime Mobile Service Identities (MMSI) between Keelung & Puson over the past 6 months. (Hat tip: @Byron_Wan) pic.twitter.com/4jvqVMTBc8&mdash; Ray Powell (@GordianKnotRay) January 6, 2025 Multiple reports indicate that Taiwanese authorities believe that the vessel was involved in the incident, whether deliberate or otherwise. Combined with the multiple identities, suspicions have been raised by the fact that the vessel was sailing back and forth in waters near Taiwan in the past two weeks, according to one Taiwanese security official. 'While its intentions remain unclear, the possibility of a Chinese provisional vessel conducting gray zone harassment couldn’t be ruled out,' the Taiwanese Coast Guard said. The cargo ship was intercepted by the Taiwanese Coast Guard around eight miles off the north coast of Taiwan late on Friday, after a nine-hour mission to track it down. According to Facebook page Taiwan ADIS, Coast Guard Administration intercepted a Tanzania-registered container ship with Chinese name XINGSHUN39 (MMSI 677087200) — but apparently all media in Taiwan reported it as Cameroon-registered SHUNXIN39 — after it was suspected of… pic.twitter.com/LUJnxy2CHJ&mdash; Byron Wan (@Byron_Wan) January 4, 2025 Although it was ordered to move closer to shore for an investigation, rough weather prevented any member of the Coast Guard from boarding the vessel. Instead, the Shunxin-39 was able to continue en route to the port of Busan in South Korea. The Taiwanese Coast Guard says it has notified the corresponding South Korean maritime agency about the case. Although they were not able to investigate the vessel, Taiwanese authorities say they have collected radar data and navigation records that will be provided to prosecutors for further investigation. As to the suspicion of potential deliberate sabotage by the Shunxin-39, the deputy head of Taiwan’s digital ministry, Herming Chiueh, told The Wall Street Journal that the cable-cutting was likely intentional. 'You need to accidentally [drop your] anchor on the cable, and then you need to accidentally turn on your engine with the anchor down, and even [if] you realize your anchor is down, you need to keep the engine moving until you cut the cable,' Chiueh said. Chiueh added that he recently met with European counterparts to discuss the vulnerability of undersea cables. He said that there was a growing consensus that vessels suspected of sabotage needed to be stopped and searched immediately because once it is 'sailing back to China, you can’t do anything.' Whether deliberate or not, the incident last Friday was the latest in a series that has affected Taiwanese undersea cables. In February 2023, for example, two undersea internet cables running between Taiwan and the island of Dongyin, part of the Matsu Islands, and roughly 30 miles off the coast of China, were severed by a Chinese fishing boat and a cargo vessel, according to Taiwan authorities. The island was left without internet access for weeks. Fishermen on a jetty at a harbor on Beigan Island in the Matsu archipelago.

In a recent incident of possible sabotage in the Baltic, on December 25, 2024, an undersea power cable between Finland and Estonia was severed, with suspicion falling on one of Russia’s so-called shadow fleet of oil tankers. After being seized by Finnish Police, the ship in question, the Eagle S, was found to be 'kitted out with special transmitting and receiving devices that were used to monitor naval activity, according to a source with direct involvement in the ship,' Lloyd’s List reported. A month before that, Denmark confirmed it was monitoring a Chinese cargo vessel at the center of allegations surrounding damage to two communication cables in the Baltic Sea.

Photo by MIKKEL BERG PEDERSEN/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images In another prominent incident, back in October 2023, a Hong Kong-registered containership, the Newnew Polar Bear, was accused of damaging the Balticconnector natural-gas pipeline and data cables by dragging its anchor along the seabed in the Gulf of Finland. Also in this incident, the suspect ship rapidly left the area, headed toward Russia, without authorities having investigated it. Incidents like these have highlighted the vulnerability of critical undersea infrastructure to sabotage, especially as part of so-called 'gray zone' tactics or a hybrid warfare campaign of the kind that NATO officials have repeatedly warned that Russia is currently embarking upon. For Taiwan, the concerns are very much the same, although China is the antagonist. Taiwan already faces regular large-scale Chinese military maneuvers directed at it, including practice blockades of the island as well as exercises featuring so-called 'precision strikes.' This is in addition to less-obvious tactics designed to undermine Taiwanese self-rule and democratic institutions. A PLA Navy Type 072A (Yuting II) class landing ship sails toward a zone in which China said it would conduct live-fire exercises northeast of Pingtan Island, the closest point in China to Taiwan, in China’s southeast Fujian province on April 10, 2023. Photo by GREG BAKER/AFP via Getty Images Any Chinese military move on Taiwan — which Beijing views as a rogue province that is fully within its sovereign territory — would very likely be preceded by efforts to knock out undersea communications infrastructure, strangling the data flow to and from the from island. Only last month, the Taiwanese military ran a war game based on potential Chinese aggression, in which one of the scenarios involved a communications blackout caused by the severing of undersea cables. Meanwhile, the importance of having more robust communications is something that Taiwanese officials have been concerned with for some time now. So far, it has been far from easy to attribute cable-cutting incidents to any particular culprit, be it Russia, China, or another actor altogether, but there seems little doubt that these kinds of activities are on the increase. With the Shunxin-39 having escaped investigation on this occasion, it seems unlikely that the cable cutting off the Taiwanese coast will ever be traced definitively back to Beijing. On the other hand, the incident is a stark reminder of the vulnerability of this kind of critical infrastructure. For Taiwan, in particular, it will also be seen as another example of China’s willingness to employ a wide range of tactics, many of them unorthodox, to try and undermine the island’s independence.

Murder Hornet Nickname For F/A-18s Equipped With Nine Air-To-Air ...	The U.S. Navy is now officially using 'Murder Hornet' to refer to F/A-18E/F fighters armed with five AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) and four AIM-9X Sidewinders. The air-to-air ordnance configuration for the Super Hornet made its combat debut last year in operations over and around the Red Sea and was enabled by a crash program to allow F/A-18E/Fs to carry more AIM-9Xs, which TWZ was first to report on. The Murder Hornet configuration and its use in combat were among various highlights the office of the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) included in a recently released year-in-review factsheet for 2024. The formal unveiling of the AIM-174B air-launched version of the Standard Missile-6 (SM-6), the first combat employment of an AGM-88E Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile (AARGM), and the service's first air-to-air engagement of a hostile drone were also included. TWZ was also the first to report on the AGM-88E shot, which destroyed an Mi-24 Hind attack helicopter on the ground in Yemen. An F/A-18E with the Murder Hornet loadout launches from the flight deck of the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower in the Red Sea on April 19, 2024. USN As already noted, the new air-to-air loadout for the F/A-18E/F required the Navy to first clear the jets to carry AIM-9Xs on their outboard underwing stations (stations 2 and 10). Previously, the service's Super Hornets could only carry the latest generation Sidewinders on their wingtips. The Navy did this in response to urgent operational demands to give the jets more magazine depth to help tackle kamikaze drones launched by Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen. F/A-18E/Fs with the Muder Hornet loadout were first observed conducting operations in the Red Sea region while flying from the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower in the April-May 2024 timeframe. Those aircraft were also seen carrying AN/ASQ-228 Advanced Targeting Forward-Looking Infrared (ATFLIR) targeting pods and centerline 480-gallon fuel tanks. The configuration has since been observed on Super Hornets assigned to other carriers operating in the Middle East. A Murder Hornet assigned to the air wing aboard the supercarrier USS Theodore Roosevelt lands at Muwaffaq Salti Air Base in Jordan in August 2024. USAF As TWZ has noted in the past, while Super Hornets could carry an additional AIM-120 in place of the ATFLIR pod: 'Advanced targeting pods are critical components of a modern tactical fighter’s air defense arsenal as they allow for beyond-visual-range positive identification of targets. This is especially important in densely populated and complex airspace, and can lead to quicker identification friend or foe and the ability to fire on a target with confidence long before it would be within the rules of engagement otherwise. ATFLIR’s infrared and TV sensors can be slaved to the Super Hornet’s radar and vice-versa, adding an extra layer of integrated targeting.' 'The pods can also collect important intelligence on aerial targets, whether they are engaged or not. A secondary quasi-infrared search and track mode is also available on some pods that can provide detection of stealthy targets, although this is not nearly as capable as a dedicated advanced IRST sensor system.' The ATFLIR pods are especially important for visually identifying enemy aerial targets at night. The nine-missile Murder Hornet configuration does leave two additional underwing pylons empty. At the same time, not having stores on those stations, especially additional draggy drop tanks, would help the jets retain decent dash speed and maneuverability. Without additional tanks, the Super Hornet range and time on station would also be reduced, which could make the configuration particularly well suited to area air and fleet defense missions closer to carrier strike groups. It's also worth noting that the centerline drop tanks on Murder Hornets could be substituted for one incorporating an infrared search and track (IRST) system, but also less fuel, in the future. The IRSTs are set to give Super Hornets a substantially improved ability to spot and track aircraft and other aerial targets, especially stealthy ones, at extended ranges, as you can read more about in this past TWZ feature. The Super Hornet's manufacturer Boeing has touted a heavy air-to-air loadout of 12 AIM-120s and two AIM-9Xs in the past, but it is unclear if Navy jets are authorized to fly in that configuration. Older Legacy Hornets can also carry up to 10 AMRAAMs and two Sidewinders.

USN The term 'Murder Hornet' was also used colloquially to refer to another even heavier air-to-air loadout seen last year on an F/A-18F assigned to Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Nine (VX-9) during Exercise Gray Flag 2024. The VX-9 jet carried four AIM-174Bs, as well as three AIM-120s and a pair of AIM-9Xs. Babe wake up, more Murder Hornet pic.twitter.com/nljWCEUc7P&mdash; Doha (@Doha104p3) November 5, 2024 There have been nicknames for other ordnance configurations on other aircraft in the past, too, including the 'Beast Mode' loadouts Lockheed Martin has touted for certain variants of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. 'Murder Hornet' had previously entered the American lexicon more broadly following the appearance of Asian giant hornets in the United States in 2019. U.S. authorities declared those real and invasive hornets had been eradicated in the country in December. Navy Super Hornets continue to be a very active part of U.S. military operations in and around the Red Sea against the Houthis. More than a year on now, the Yemeni militants continue to launch kamikaze drone and other attacks on commercial vessels and foreign warships in the region, as well as against targets in Israel. Drone kill marks seen on an F/A-18E Super Hornet from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower's air wing last year. USN/The War Zone Giving tactical combat jets greater magazine depth is becoming increasingly important, in general, especially given the ever-growing threats posed by various tiers of drones across domains. The U.S. Air Force's new F-15EX Eagle II is a prime example of this trend. Air Force F-15E Strike Eagles, which can also carry a large amount of ordnance, notably found themselves quickly running out of missiles while shooting down Iranian drones headed for Israel in April 2024, as you can read more about here. Altogether, unlike the Asian giant hornet population in the United States, Navy Murder Hornets look set to continue making appearances, in the Red Sea, the Middle East, and potentially elsewhere.

Red Sea Attacks Are Testing Combat Information Centers Aboard U.S...	The Combat Information Center (CIC) is the nerve center and tactical brain of a U.S. Navy surface combatant. These high-tech floating command centers and their watchstanders have been put to the test over the last year unlike any other time in history, as missile and drone barrages from Houthi rebels in Yemen have plagued the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. With this in mind, TWZ spoke with multiple surface warfare officers (SWOs) about the realities sailors face when fighting their ship from within the CIC, including what factors come into play, what mistakes can arise during tense, time sensitive engagements and the effects of being on patrol in a free-fire zone for months on end. Cocooned within the ship, amongst the dimly lit CIC packed with glowing screens, are between 10 and 20 sailors on watch at any given time. Led by a tactical action officer (TAO), they track all threats and movements in the region around the ship. A CIC’s air warfare watchstanders might flag an inbound Houthi missile and approve firing orders to other ship combat systems, while others are scanning the rest of the sky, correlating electronic warfare signals, tracking other surface vessels and watching out for submarines. CICs also keep in constant communication with other Navy vessels and aircraft in the area via various datalink systems, sharing sensor data and coordinating actions. The CIC works closely with the bridge to best move the ship to its most survivable or advantageous position at any given time as well. The combat information center (CIC) aboard a modernized U.S. Navy cruiser. (U.S. Navy) 'The things that make the environment really busy are just trying to manage threats, trying to manage traffic, trying to manage the general environment,' Bradley Martin, a retired surface warfare officer who spent two-thirds of his career at sea, told TWZ. 'It’s designed to handle a lot of information and handle processing and display and dissemination. But like anywhere, when a lot of things are going on, it takes a lot of concentration to keep things straight.' Despite the slew of information being passed back and forth in the CIC, particularly in a cruiser serving as the air defense commander for a carrier strike group, the CIC — referred to as 'combat' in the surface fleet — would appear calm to an outsider who walked into the space, according to a retired Navy cruiser captain who spoke with TWZ on condition of anonymity to share his assessment. But the seeming tranquility of sailors on computers or talking into headsets belies the stakes of the CIC's work. 'You have external comms coming from the aircraft carrier, from the planes,' he said. 'You have someone in combat typically talking to the planes themselves, checking in and checking out. You've got internal communications, everybody's got a headset on, they've typically got one circuit in one ear and another circuit in the other.' But these days, CIC watchstanders have been tested in unprecedented ways every day in the Red Sea over the past year, these SWOs tell TWZ. Sailors assigned to the Navy destroyer USS Carney (DDG-64) at work inside the ship's combat information center in July 2024. (U.S. Navy) 'As the amount of aircraft and the threat of actually taking a hit increases, then the pucker factor and the intensity increases as well,' the retired captain said. The Red Sea fight has required endless vigilance and honed attention from CICs the entire time their ship is operating in those waters, according to an active-duty SWO who requested anonymity to share his personal thoughts. 'You run that kind of high-stress scenario from the moment you enter the theater until you leave if you’re operating in the Red Sea,' the active-duty SWO told TWZ. 'Every other test since Operation Iraqi Freedom has been a test of our ability to support strikes into other places. This is the first time we've had a sustained conventional threat against open water shipping.' Since October 2023, Navy destroyers have been shooting down aerial drones and missiles, as well as sinking drone boats, launched by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, sometimes at a near-daily clip. You can read about the Houthi's arsenal being brought to bear against shipping around the Bab-el-Madeb Strait here. But even as CICs track, identify and at times engage with a variety of objects popping up on their sensors, system breakdowns and inexperienced sailors hinder effective CIC operations even in peaceful waters, raising the stakes of the current Red Sea mission — and the consequences of mistakes. As an investigation into how the Navy cruiser USS Gettysburg (CG-64) came to shoot down a F/A-18 Super Hornet jet over the Red Sea last month continues, the cruiser’s CIC was likely tracking a bevy of airborne objects simultaneously. TWZ previously reported that the shootdown occurred during a sustained Houthi drone and missile attack targeting the USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75) carrier strike group. Cruisers serve as the air defense headquarters within such strike groups. A view of flight operations aboard the USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75) on December 18, 2024. (U.S. Navy) With regard to the Gettysburg friendly-fire incident, Martin said they were dealing with a situation where there were a lot of aircraft in the sky, along with surface threats, all of which created 'a complicated air defense environment.' 'Whether or not somebody might have made a serious mistake with the Gettysburg, we don’t know what set of systems or decisions [were made], or what might have happened,' Martin said. 'They’re busy and dealing with some ambiguous situations, situations unlike what the Navy has dealt with in a long time.' The SWOs who spoke with TWZ said that Navy CICs in the Red Sea deserve credit for executing so well. 'These ships over the last year have done a fairly remarkable number of engagements, far more than the Navy had done in the previous 50 years,' Martin said. 'And they are by and large handling those correctly.' Still, the active-duty SWO said the Houthi aerial drone threat adds a major layer of complexity for the CICs to manage. 'When a missile gets fired, I know what that is, it's coming out of Yemen, moving at this speed, blast it out of the sky,' he said. 'All these drones just act like airplanes, and the problem is airplanes can be good or bad, and it's hard to tell the difference.' 'I don't envy their position,' the active-duty SWO said of CIC teams in the Red Sea. 'It sounds miserable. It's not black and white, and you have a bunch of gray zone contacts.' 'It's pretty damn complicated, and it requires a very high level of cognitive attention to detail, and alertness,' the retired cruiser captain noted. Adding to the Red Sea stress is the fact that the systems upon which a CIC relies regularly go down, according to an active-duty, former destroyer commander who requested anonymity to speak frankly. That’s compounded by the fact that, while a CIC watch team may spend months training up together, some of those sailors will never deploy due to them having to head to a new assignment. 'It’s a miracle if you can train the same team that goes from basic phase to advanced phase to deployment,' the former destroyer skipper said. The guided-missile destroyer USS Gravely (DDG-107) launches Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAM) in January 2024 in the Red Sea. (U.S. Navy) Watching from afar, the former destroyer CO fears that a mix of inexperienced CIC sailors and the kind of regular system outages that plague Navy warships could at any time cause things 'to kind of break down pretty quick' in the Red Sea, despite the winning track record so far. While the Houthis might not be the most advanced threat, 'it does not take much' for a warship’s radar or other systems to crash, he said, leaving the vessel without critical information and vulnerable. The nature of the Houthi fight makes it harder to decipher objects on the radar as well, the officer said. In such instances, the TAO will often do a 'hook and look,' locking onto an airborne object that pops up on radar and then working to identify it. 'If I had hooked an unknown track that was at 10,000 feet going 340 knots in the direction of the carrier, my first thought is that’s an F-18,' and other ship systems would soon confirm that, the former destroyer CO said. But in the Red Sea, an enemy aerial drone may get tracked at the same bearing and range, but perhaps at a lower altitude than the friendly jet, which can sometimes cause watch standers or radar systems to 'swap tracks,' he said. 'So we have people trained to then hook and look and verify and interrogate again,' the former destroyer CO said. 'When you’re doing all of that with a couple of aircraft, that’s hard. If you’re doing it with, like, 15 aircraft, it’s really hard. If you’re doing that with 15 aircraft, missiles and [air drones], it’s very, very hard.' The U.S. Navy destroyer USS Carney (DDG-64) fires a missile to intercept a Houthi barrage in October 2023. (U.S. Navy) CICs also regularly struggle with 'leaders,' or long lines on a radar that look like something speeding at 780 knots toward the ship, only for it to suddenly disappear. And while a warship’s Aegis Combat System is designed to help clear some of that clutter, the former destroyer CO said CIC watch standers risk becoming complacent with leaders. 'Sometimes you’ll drop clutter so routinely that you could end up dropping a missile,' he said. 'There's specific parameters to set the ship to, even in the Red Sea, but you have to go through that process to make sure that your clutter mapping and your systems configuration is accurate to that exact location with the amount of sand that's in the air, deducting for the temperature and the environment and atmosphere and everything else.' 'More tracks and confusion, and then you start throwing in some of those long leaders of clutter, because it’s the Red Sea, full of sand and shit,' the former destroyer CO added. 'You’re like, well, I hope that’s clutter.' Meanwhile, CIC sailors are working to coordinate object assessments with other strike group CICs and the air defense commander, a task made harder by the Red Sea’s busy skies. 'So, track number 1234, is F/A-18 friendly, or track number 1234 is hostile, [aerial drone], cruise missile, whatever that is,' the former destroyer CO explained. 'But if they’re doing that for every one of the inbound threats, then you have a lot of track coordination that’s going on in the background in a very short amount of time. That has to be correct, because they can force order something in the [Link 16 communications] system that will make it that thing, regardless of somebody disagreeing with it or not.' A supporter of Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels fields a diorama of a U.S. warship under a Houthi missile during a demonstration in the capital Sanaa on Dec. 6, 2024. (Mohammed Hamoud/Getty Images) The former destroyer CO said he feels it’s 'lucky' that no Navy ships have been hit so far in the Red Sea, but he suspects 'the American public are going to lose their minds if a destroyer gets hit.' 'At some point, sailors are going to get killed, and I feel like it doesn’t take much,' he said. 'You’ve got a bad interface control, system casualty, fog of war, clutter, or your missile malfunctions, your [Phalanx Close-In Weapons System] wasn’t aligned properly, or something like that.' The Phalanx Close-In Weapons System (CIWS). (U.S. Navy) Despite the efforts of the Navy warships and their CICs in the Red Sea, the former destroyer CO also said he thinks the Houthis’ tactics will improve, as will their weapons, if other nations opt to provide them with better munitions. While Iran has largely supplied the Houthis thus far, reports surfaced last year that Russia was seeking to arm the Houthis with more-advanced cruise missiles. A gunner's mate stands watch on the optical sighting system in the combat information center aboard the Navy destroyer USS Gravely (DDG-107) while transiting the Bab al-Mandeb Strait on Feb. 19, 2024. (U.S. Navy) 'They’re doing everything they possibly can to try and kill Americans,' he said. 'At the end of the day, I think there’s a lot of luck involved in this right now, to be right and perfect 24/7.' When and how the Red Sea battle will end remains to be seen. Until then, the U.S. sailors standing watch in the CICs will continue to deal with a hostile, crowded and frenetic combat environment, with no shortage of objects to track and threats to engage.

Bunker Talk: Let’s Talk About All The Things We Did And Didn’t Co...	Welcome to Bunker Talk. This is a weekend open discussion post for the best commenting crew on the net, in which we can chat about all the stuff that went on this week that we didn’t cover. We can also talk about the stuff we did or whatever else grabs your interest. In other words, it’s an off-topic thread. The caption to this week’s top shot reads: Picture released on August 16, 1965 of the HQ transmission post in a buried bunker in Duc Co Camp (or called Chu Dron Special Force camp), the US Army and Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) base, near Pleiku in the Gia Lai Province.

If you want to talk politics, do so respectfully and know that there’s always somebody that isn’t going to agree with you. If you have political differences, hash it out respectfully, stick to the facts, and no childish name-calling or personal attacks of any kind. If you can’t handle yourself in that manner, then please, discuss virtually anything else. No drive-by garbage political memes. No conspiracy theory rants. Links to crackpot sites will be axed, too. Trolling and shitposting will not be tolerated. No obsessive behavior about other users. Just don’t interact with folks you don’t like. Do not be a sucker and feed trolls! That’s as much on you as on them. Use the mute button if you don’t like what you see. So unless you have something of quality to say, know how to treat people with respect, understand that everyone isn’t going to subscribe to your exact same worldview, and have come to terms with the reality that there is no perfect solution when it comes to moderation of a community like this, it’s probably best to just move on. Finally, as always, report offenders, please. This doesn’t mean reporting people who don’t share your political views, but we really need your help in this regard. The Bunker is open!

New Armor Kits Being Installed On Ukraine’s Western Air Defense S...	A major Ukrainian metal and mining company that makes so-called cope cages for the country’s tanks and fighting vehicles says it has installed a new armor protection system on at least one of Ukraine's operational high-end air defense systems, with plans to produce more. The development comes from lessons learned from the war. First Russia, then Ukraine, began adding caging and additional armor to nearly all their mechanized equipment to provide some level of protection, primarily against drone attacks. Today, Western air defense systems donated to Ukraine are among Russia's highest priority targets, with strikes on them from various types of lower-end drones and more advanced standoff munitions, including time-sensitive attacks using drones for spotting and Iskander ballistic missiles for the strikes. Artillery can also pose a danger for those systems located close to the front. The Metinvest Group on Friday said it has designed a system using nearly 200 armored steel plates, up to 8 mm thick, that are attached to the sides of a Western-donated air defense system’s command module. The total weight of the armor exceeds 2.6 tons 'but does not affect the system’s functionality or mobility,' Metinvest claimed. It is a part of the firm’s broader 'Steel Front' wartime production initiative, which has also been churning out pre-fabricated protected shelters, body armor, and other kinds of materiel for the Ukrainian armed forces. Protective armor panels were installed on a German-donated IRIS-T air defense command module. (Metinvest) The company said the system is designed to protect against shrapnel, without mentioning any specific weapon. Even protection from nearby strikes could be critical to the survivability of air defenders and their vehicles as many of these air defense systems are made up of multiple mobile or semi-mobile components. If one is directly targeted, armor could help save the prized command vehicle and its occupants nearby. The same can be said for some cluster weapon and artillery attacks. 'We developed the project from scratch in a month and a half, and, following the blueprints, manufactured a shield for the crews of the Patriot surface-to-air missile (SAM) system using Metinvest’s Ukrainian armor steel,' said Oleksandr Myronenko, Chief Operating Officer of Metinvest Group and the head of the Group’s dedicated steel production for the needs of the Ukrainian army. 'This shield guarantees protection against fragmentation damage for both the defenders and the air defense control system. Our experienced engineers also supervised the assembly of the armor.' Ukrainian Air Force spokesman Col. Yuri Ignat told us that the protection system was actually installed on a German-made IRIS-T SLM air defense system now deployed in Ukraine. You can see the command module for that system in the video below and the images at the top of this story. The reason for the discrepancy is unclear, but it could very well exist on both types. We have reached out to Metinvest for details.

The IRIS-T SLS is for short-range protection while the IRIS-T SLM is for medium-range. Both fire variants of the IRIS-T missile that was originally designed for air-to-air applications. Germany's Diehl Defense makes the IRIS-T. Ukraine has received six SLMs and five SLSs. The IRIS-T SLM system components. (Diehl Defense) To date, Ukraine has lost several components to Western-donated Patriot, IRIS-T, and National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS) air defense systems according to the Oyrx open-source tracking group. At least two M901 launchers for MIM-104 Patriot systems have been destroyed and an AN/MPQ-53 radar damaged. At least one MAN SX45 8&#215;8 launcher for an IRIS-T SLM system was destroyed and a TRML-4D multi-function radar was damaged while two NASAMS launchers have been destroyed, the group states. The actual figures are very likely to be significantly higher because Oryx only tabulates losses for which it has visual confirmation. Metinvest said it has drawn on its previous experience with armored vehicles to develop the new protection system for the air defense systems. 'The Group has mastered the production of steel screens for the main domestic T-64 and T-72 tanks, American M1 Abrams tanks, Bradley infantry fighting vehicles and is preparing to integrate them into various Leopard 2 modifications,' the company noted. 'To date, more than 300 screens have been delivered to the military.' Back in March, we profiled the company's development of the Abrams caging. From the pictures Metinvest released of the Abrams equipped with the screen, the array was extensive with a main screen on top of the turret and others around the front, sides, and rear. The full configuration looked to have additional angled sections that close the gaps between the top and the side panels. In the image below, you can see very small gaps left open for the Abrams’ side-mounted launchers used to fire smoke grenades to help conceal the tank. It is worth noting that FPV drone operators have been proven very adept at using available gaps, even small ones, in armor screens and other defenses to slip in and make attacks. Ukrainian Abrams tanks are emerging with new factory-standard anti-drone 'cope cage' armor screens and additional explosive reactive armor a month after they were reportedly pulled from the front lines due to drone threats. (Metinvest) Metinvest Another image provided by the company shows an additional screen attached to the rear of the hull. A picture showing the screen around the rear of the hull. This also has the Steel Front initiative logo at the top right. (Metinvest) As Metinvest’s press release at the time made clear, the main purpose of the new and elaborate factory-made cope cage for the Abrams is to help protect these high-value tanks against first-person view kamikaze drones. Highly maneuverable and carrying warheads that detonate on contact, armed uncrewed aerial vehicles of this type have become a near-constant scourge on both sides of the battlefield in Ukraine. FPV types, in particular, are now talked about as being on par with artillery in terms of battlefield significance. Russia has also steadily challenged Ukraine’s initial dominance in this field, as well. One air defense expert we talked to questioned Metinvest's claim that the added weight of the armor on the SAM command module won't affect its mobility. 'Adding 4,600 pounds to any vehicles above the standard load plan is a lot of weight,' David Shank, a retired Army colonel and former commandant of the Army Air Defense Artillery School at Ft. Sill, Oklahoma, told us on Friday. 'I would submit that this weight would hinder the performance of the prime mover which pulls these large trailer systems.' That's an important consideration, Shank added, given that Ukraine frequently moves around its air defense components to address emerging threats. Any added protection for air defense crews will be welcome regardless, especially for the systems that are operating forward, well within the reach of multiple Russian threats. The Latest On the battlefield, Russia continues to chew up territory in the Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions in the eastern part of Ukraine. Here are the key takeaways from the latest Institute for the Study of War (ISW) assessment: Kursk: Ukrainian and Russian forces continued combat engagements in Ukraine's salient in Kursk Oblast on January 1 and 2, but there were no confirmed changes to the frontline. Kharkiv: Russian forces continued offensive operations near Vovchansk (northeast of Kharkiv City) on December 31 through January 2 but did not make any confirmed advances. Luhansk: Russian forces reportedly advanced northwest of Kreminna amid continued offensive operations along the Kupyansk-Svatove-Kreminna line on January 1 and 2. Donetsk: Russian forces recently advanced near Siversk, Toretsk, Pokrovsk, Kurakhove and Vuhledar but did not gain any ground near Chasiv Yar or Velyka Novosilka. Zaphorizhzhia: Russian forces recently advanced in western Zaporizhia Oblast amid continued offensive operations in the area on January 1 to 2. Kherson: Russian forces continued attacks in the Dnipro River area and on the islands in the river delta on December 31 and January 1 to 2. NEW: Ukraine's decision to not renew its contract to transport Russian gas through Ukrainian territory will likely significantly impact Russian gas revenues despite Kremlin posturing to the contrary.

'The Immediate Action on Air Defence (IAAD) project is led by Germany and aims to support Ukraine's air defenses with donations of various air defense systems and to support through joint funding those nations that have chosen to donate air defense systems to Ukraine,' according to the MoD. 'Sweden reported interest in participating in the project during the autumn.' Romania 'is in need of financial resources to re-get projectiles, sensors, and other Patriot-type equipment as a replacement for the systems donated to Ukraine in 2024,' the MoD noted, adding that the funds come from previously announced aid packages to Ukraine. Sweden is providing 300 million Swedish krona as part of the German IAAD initiative, which aims to strengthen Ukraine's air defence. The funds will go to Romania, which will be compensated for the 'donation' of an MIM-104 Patriot fire unit that was delivered last year. pic.twitter.com/HzVMzQ0M7C&mdash; German Aid to Ukraine (@deaidua) January 3, 2025 The 'strong and unpredictable' nature of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump could work in Kyiv’s favor, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said during a recent television interview. 'I would very much like President Trump’s unpredictability to be directed primarily toward the Russian Federation,' Zelensky said. The Ukrainian leader doubted Trump could live up to his promise of ending the nearly three-year-old war in just one day. However, 'the ‘hot’ stage of the war can end quite quickly if Trump is strong in his position,' Zelensky suggested.

'But I raised an issue, saying we didn’t hear what specific countries will join this initiative, and whether the U.S. will be there,' noted Zelensky, who met with Trump and Macron in Paris last month.

'Kursk is a very strong trump card in all negotiations, especially with countries that are very important to us, particularly those in the Global South,' he said, according to the Ukrainian Ukrinform news outlet. 'I never anticipated it would have such a significant influence, as these nations had been under the sway of 'invincible Russia.'' Zelensky added that Russia's decision to send North Korean military personnel to Kursk was a tactical blunder. 'They [the Russians] took the North Korean contingent. Where did they send it? To that very place [to the Kursk region]. I believe that this is a tactical mistake on their part,' he suggested. As we have previously reported, of about 12,000 North Korean troops sent to Russia, more than 1,000 have been killed or wounded in Kursk, John Kirby, the White House National Security spokesman, told reporters, including from The War Zone.

Ukraine’s State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) is examining the actions of the 155th Mechanized Brigade after accusations of mismanagement and massive desertions were made by Ukrainian journalist Yuri Butusov, according to the Suspline news outlet. 'The investigation is ongoing,' SBI told Suspline on Thursday. 'It is too early to talk about any preliminary results.' On Dec. 31, Butusov, editor of the Ukrainian Censor.net news outlet, wrote a scathing story claiming his investigation found a host of problems with the brigade. Its founding was an 'organizational chaos' from its inception and faced manpower shortages even before leaving for France as 2,500 troops were sent off to other units. That removed many of the most qualified personnel from the brigade. Of the 1,924 soldiers eventually sent to France, only 51 had more than a year of military service, while 1,414 had served for less than two months, Butusov noted. Making matters worse, between March and November, over 1,700 soldiers deserted, Butusov claimed without providing evidence. Though the unit was replenished with new recruits, these often did not undergo 'proper selection process,' the journalist posited. Butusov blamed Ukraine’s leadership, including Zelensky and Command-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Oleksandr Syrsky. 'France fully fulfilled all obligations for arming and training the brigade, which the Ukrainians demanded,' Butusov wrote. 'But during the training stage of the new brigade in France, more than 50 servicemen fled. This raised questions among the French leadership about the seriousness of the Ukrainians' attitude to the implementation of such an expensive project. This approach seriously discredits Zelensky's entire plan, and therefore a scandal began.' The military, meanwhile, blamed the brigade's commander, Dmytro Riumshin for those desertions. He was dismissed in early December alongside several other top officers. The new commanders were unaware of the problems plaguing the unit, adding to the confusion, Butusov wrote. Beyond the desertion problem, the 155th Brigade did not receive drones or electronic warfare equipment from the Ukrainian command, Butusov argued. In addition to poor organization and insufficient training, that is said to have contributed to the losses the unit suffered once deployed in combat in November. 'This is indeed a crime, but the crime is not of soldiers and officers - but of the leaders of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters, the Ministry of Defense, and the General Staff, who continue to waste lives and state funds on new projects, instead of strengthening experienced and combat-ready brigades,' Butusov concluded.

Israel Buys 7.62x51mm Version Of U.S. Army’s New Sig Sauer M250 L...	The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has reportedly acquired a version of the 6.8x51mm M250 light machine gun that Sig Sauer developed for the U.S. Army, but chambered to fire the NATO-standard 7.62x51mm round. Sig Sauer's design may now be in line to supplant at least a portion of Israeli Negev light machine guns, 5.56x45mm and 7.62x51mm variations of which are current in IDF service. Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported yesterday on the IDF's purchase of the 7.62x51mm version of what Sig Sauer currently markets commercially just as its Light Machine Gun (LMG). The outlet cited anonymous sources, as well as a video that emerged last month, seen in the social media post below, which indicates the guns are intended as Negev replacements.

The fourth gun has an EOTech EXPS-series holographic sight, which is also non-magnifying. What looks to be a night vision or compact thermal optic is also visible in the foreground at the beginning of the clip. The guns with the ROMEO8T optics also have aiming lasers mounted on accessory rails on the front left side of the handguard. All four LMGs have suppressors fitted, as well. The U.S. Army is also fielding its M250 versions of the LMG with ROMEO8T optics. The service announced back in 2022 that it had chosen Sig Sauer to supply the core components of its Next Generation Squad Weapons (NGSW) family, which includes the M250 and the M7 rifle, the latter of which also fires the 6.8x51mm round. Per Sig Sauer, there is no difference dimensionally between the 6.8x51mm and 7.62x51mm versions of the LMG, or a third variation chambered for the 6.5mm Creedmoor round. All of them have 16-inch barrels and 37-inch overall lengths with the gun's buttstock in its collapsed position. No empty or loaded weights are provided in the company's publicly available defense catalog, but the U.S. Army says its variant tips the scales at 13 pounds unloaded and 14.5 pounds with a sound suppressor fitted. The page on the Light Machine Gun from Sig Sauer's publically available defense products catalog. Sig Sauer Overall, Sig Sauer's LMG was designed with modularity in mind, as well as with ergonomics intended to mimic those found on AR-15/M16-pattern rifles that U.S. and Israeli military personnel, and many others around the globe, are already familiar with. The IDF's acquisition of at least some 7.62x51mm LMGs does not come as a complete surprise. Sig Sauer notably displayed a placard detailing 'Major Global Contract Wins' at the official opening of its expanded ammunition plant in Jacksonville, Arkansas, in October 2024. Included therein in the 2024 column were depictions of the LMG and the .338 Norma Magnum version of the company's new Medium Machine Gun (MMG), along with the ROMEO8T optic and linked .338 ammunition, all with Israeli flags alongside them.

There is a possibility that the guns seen in the video earlier in this story are part of small batch for test and evaluation. 'Both the [Israeli] Defense Ministry and the IDF declined to comment on' whether the LMG specifically was intended to replace one or both versions of the Negev light machine gun, according to Haaretz. Though very likely to be heavier than the M250 to some degree, the 7.62x51mm LMG could still be significantly lighter than the existing 7.62x51mm Negev NG7 in its standard configuration with a 20-inch long barrel, which has an empty weight of around 17.5 pounds. Israel Weapon Industries (IWI) also offers a short-barrel version of the NG7 that is marginally lighter and an ultra-light derivative that is just 14.5 pounds empty. Despite its smaller caliber, the standard 5.56x45mm version of the Negev is also around 16.5 pounds before any ammunition is loaded. A member of the IDF with a Negev NG7 during operations in the Gaza Strip in November 2023. IDF The NG7, which was unveiled in 2012, already reflected a broader global trend in interest in lighter-weight machine guns chambered in 7.62x51mm and similar calibers. Guns in this broad category offer greater range and terminal performance in a handier package compared to light machine guns chambered to fire smaller rounds. These were key factors that led the U.S. Army to field versions of the 7.62x51mm Mk 48 light machine gun, a scaled-up derivative of the 5.56x45mm M249 Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW) originally developed for the U.S. Navy SEALs, and then the M250. A member of the US Army with a Mk 48 machine gun. US Army For Israel, a 7.62x51mm version of Sig Sauer's LMG also allows for the use of existing ammunition stocks. With the U.S. Army planning to buy thousands of M250s, there is set to be a robust overall supply chain for the company's light machine gun family for decades to come, as well. The IDF more broadly adopting Sig Sauer's LMG, as well as its MMG, would be another major win for the company, which has been making steady inroads in the global small arms market for years now. Acquisition decisions by Israel's armed forces often have trend-setting impacts around the world. It will be interesting to see how widely the IDF fields the new guns from Sig Sauer and how that might impact further purchases in Israel and elsewhere worldwide.

Ukrainian Su-27 Flanker Pilot’s Rare Account Of The Changing Air ...	An inside look at the life of a Ukrainian Su-27 Flanker fighter pilot in the country’s war with Russia is the topic of a recently released video from the Ukrainian Air Force. The interview with the Su-27 pilot with the callsign 'Viking' is a rare opportunity to hear about some of the challenges — and successes — of the Ukrainian Air Force’s fighter fleet, which, despite the recent introduction of F-16s, is still dominated by the Soviet-era Su-27 and MiG-29 Fulcrum. Viking starts the interview with some reflections on the very first days of fighting after Russia launched its full-scale invasion on February 24, 2022. His experiences sound very similar to those of the late MiG-29 pilot 'Juice,' who was interviewed several times by TWZ before his death in a training accident in August 2023. The loss of Juice has also meant that opportunities for these kinds of interviews are now much reduced. Viking was not at his normal base in the Zhytomyr region when the war started, he was in Kyiv. His race to Zhytomyr was frustrated by a lack of rail services out of the capital and ended with a walk of between 25-30 miles to get to the air base, still in civilian clothes. Once there, he was very quickly in the thick of the action, and from February 25 he was flying air defense missions that he described as 'deterrence,' first flown in daylight and later at night, over the Kyiv region. Viking straps into the cockpit of a Ukrainian Su-27. Ukrainian Air Force screencap 'We held them back,' Viking explained. 'If their aircraft had come here and worked freely, everything would have been completely different.' All the time, Viking and his fellow 39th Tactical Aviation Brigade (39 BrTA) pilots faced a significant disadvantage in terms of radars and missiles compared to the Russians. While Ukrainian fighters could occasionally track enemy aircraft, getting within missile-launch range was rarely possible. The Ukrainian Air Force began the war with around 32 Su-27s operational within two brigades, the 39 brTA at Ozerne in the Zhytomyr region of northwestern Ukraine and the 831 brTA at Myrhorod in the Poltava region of central Ukraine. At least 15 of Ukrainian Flankers have been visually confirmed as destroyed but, in the meantime, additional examples have also been returned to airworthiness after overhauls. The aircraft are also regularly moved around between different operating locations, some of them austere in nature, making it harder for the Russians to target them. This Su-27 landed in Romania on the first day of the conflict, for unknown reasons, and was later returned to Ukraine. via X www.twz.com Like many pilots and other Ukrainians at this time, it took some time for Viking to grasp the reality of the war, with the feeling that 'I’ll wake up and everything will be over' characterizing what he described as the difficult period in his life. At the same time, the resilience of Ukrainian non-combatants was also plain for him to see: his girlfriend chose to stay in Zhytomyr, with their cat, rather than leave the country; his parents also stayed at home, his mom sent a photo of a basket of Molotov cocktails will the message that she planned to use at least one on the invaders. 'They were in a fighting mood, and I was also in a fighting mood, but it was hard…' Viking reflected. 'The most difficult thing was misunderstanding. [Due to] the instability of the front, there was a minimum of information.' The view through the head-up display of a Ukrainian Su-27 after a missile is launched. Ukrainian Air Force screencap As an example, in these early days, Viking’s available intelligence on Russian air defenses was scrawled on a piece of map that he’d torn off, with information vital for survival being exchanged by word of mouth between pilots. The map simply showed the best route into a given area, with circles showing the approximate engagement ranges of hostile air defenses. The primary job at this time was attempting to blunt the advance of Russian tactical aircraft flying from Belarus. 'We were the only ones here, to put it bluntly. We were the first line of defense, and they were constantly trying to sneak their Su-34s and Su-35s in at night, at extremely low altitudes.' Viking dons his helmet before a sortie in a Su-27. Ukrainian Air Force screencap Complicating their job was the fact that, according to Viking, the avionics and missiles of the Ukrainian Su-27s, at this time, were 'two generations behind' those of the Russians. Within these parameters, 'the battle was reduced to trying to get closer to [the Russians].' But even if that was possible, the Ukrainian Su-27 pilots were rarely able to get within the launch parameters of their missiles, with the Russian jets always having the opportunity to launch their weapons first. 'Even though our [missile] launches had short ranges, we still tried something, we launched missiles, we held the Russians back, and we repelled these attacks every night,' Viking explains. 'Almost every pilot flew two, sometimes three sorties each night. Russian Su-35S fighters from Dzyomgi Air Base arrive in Belarus in January 2022. ahead of the full-scale invasion. Russian Ministry of Defense Su-35S fighters from Dzyomgi arrive in Belarus, in January 2022. Russian Ministry of Defense One particular sortie that Viking recalls involved a 'very, very difficult' hour-and-a-half air battle at night, during which six missiles were launched against his Su-27: 'four launches from aircraft, two launches from the ground.' Viking’s second flight that night, March 1, 2022, involved a failure of his navigation instruments, in worsening weather, with gathering clouds and fog. He had to be guided by a ground controller to land at Starokostyantyniv Air Base in western Ukraine. 'I lost my spatial orientation,' he says. 'It’s scary, you don’t understand where you are, you don’t understand where you are heading, in what attitude you are in.' Inside the cockpit of a Ukrainian Su-27. Ukrainian Air Force screencap 'Every new day of this war posed new challenges, all our training, all our vision, was based on rather outdated experiences and our weapons were quite outdated.' This was especially the case when going up against more modern Russian air defense systems, some of which work 'at a crazy range' as well as being highly mobile, in the case of the Buk and Tor (SA-11 Gadfly and SA-15 Gauntlet), especially. Russian air defenses made it 'impossible' for the Ukrainian Air Force to drop conventional unguided ordnance, making the arrival of Western-supplied precision-guided weapons an absolutely critical factor. These new weapons allowed the Ukrainian jets to operate 'a little further from the front line,' thanks to the standoff range of the new weapons. Now the Su-27 began to flex from its air-to-air specialism to more offensive strike duties. Viking’s first experience using the AGM-88 High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile, or HARM, resulted in a claimed 90 percent success rate against Russian ground-based defense targets, demonstrating 'the incredible effectiveness' of the weapon. Other milestones included Viking’s first downed drone, a challenging target for a fast-moving relatively low-tech jet, as we have discussed before. Armorers attach an AGM-88 HARM under the wing of a Ukrainian Su-27. Ukrainian Air Force screencap Viking noted that Russian media reports were highly skeptical about how U.S.-supplied weapons would be used on Ukraine’s Soviet-era aircraft, and even if this was possible. Some Russian accounts predicted that the HARMs would more likely be launched from the ground, off the back of adapted trucks, rather than from the air. The innovative approach to integrating Western weapons on Soviet-era fighters eventually involved a combination of new tactics, specially designed pylons that can pass targeting information to the missiles, as well as tablet-based cockpit interfaces. A Ukrainian Su-27 armed with a pair of infrared-guided R-73 air-to-air missiles. Ukrainian Air Force screencap Russian doubts 'played into our hands,' Viking says. 'We destroyed a lot of [air defense] complexes, damaged them, suppressed them, and forced them to retreat. This gave us space to come a little closer [to the front lines].' This, in turn, allowed Ukrainian airstrikes to reach further, bringing critical Russian military targets in Ukraine within range. 'Even the main command post of the Russian Ground Forces was hit,' Viking explains. 'They were, let’s say, punished for their insolence.' Today, the HARM is mainly used as a 'support weapon,' Viking says, meaning that they provide defensive escort for other Ukrainian aircraft, dealing with pop-up Russian air defense threats that might be encountered en route to other objectives. After the HARM, Viking’s brigade began to receive the Joint Direct Attack Munition–Extended Range (JDAM-ER) and the GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bomb (SDB).

Ukrainian Air Force screencap While he considers the 500-pound JDAM-ER to be relatively efficient, even in the face of intense Russian electronic warfare countermeasures, he singles out the SDB for particular praise, confirming that a single Su-27 can carry eight of these bombs.

The purported destruction of a Russian-occupied building by a Small Diameter Bomb strike. Ukrainian Air Force screencap 'Despite the fact that it’s quite small, it’s quite a powerful bomb,' Viking says of the SDB, noting that it can penetrate around six feet of reinforced concrete. The design philosophy behind the SDB is also in stark contrast to Soviet-era aerial bombs, which always prioritized size and weight — 'the main thing for them is that there should be a big explosion, rather than accuracy.' However, more explosive doesn’t necessarily translate to greater destructive power, as the SDB has shown. The difference in approach is also seen in Russian tactics. Viking says the Russians frequently use at least ten times as many munitions in one single area of the front lines than Ukraine does across the entirety of the front lines in a month. Viking suggests that, while Ukrainian munitions might achieve an accuracy of as high as 85 percent, Russian equivalents might only attain 15-20 percent on target, hence the need for more and heavier weapons to compensate. Viking also warns again about the particular threat posed by Russia’s relatively recently developed low-cost precision-guided glide bombs — a menace that has frustrated Ukrainian air defenses since they first began to appear in early 2023. The first known photo of the Russian UMPK glide bomb kit, based on a FAB-500M-62 bomb, carried by a Su-34, and published in January 2023. Fighterbomber Telegram channel 'To treat the symptom, it’s necessary to drive away the carriers of these glide bombs, but this is a difficult task, and it requires a complex approach. Unfortunately, there is no magic wand to drive them away. It needs a complex approach, including both the aviation component and the ground component, as well as the necessary air defense radars, and air-to-air missiles that have the ability to hit, at least at medium altitudes, targets at a range of 100 kilometers [62 miles],' Viking says, referring to the need for beyond-visual-range missiles to target the aircraft launching the the glide bombs. 'Without all these means, if the Russians continue to throw glide bombs, then the consequences will be terrible, they will simply squeeze us out, no matter how incredible our infantry is.' The Russian glide bomb problem became one of the main arguments for accelerating Ukrainian F-16 deliveries, although it remains to be seen how effective these might be in pushing back the Russian jets launching glide bombs from across the border. Ukrainian F-16s were presented during a Ukrainian Air Force Day event attended by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky on August 4, 2024. Photo by Ukrainian Presidency/Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu As the war approaches its three-year anniversary, Viking reflects that, while physically tired, his morale remains as high as ever. 'The war requires 100 percent of your effort,' he says. 'Even when you go on leave for 15 days, you come back and you don’t quite understand why already everything has changed: we are working in a new way, in new areas, the enemy has come up with a countermeasure, and we have come up with some kind of countermeasure ourselves.' Viking adds a morale-boosting slogan to a Small Diameter Bomb under the wing of a Su-27. Ukrainian Air Force screencap Despite limited F-16 deliveries so far and continued losses to the Soviet-era fleet of tactical jets, Viking says that there is no shortage of trained manpower or aircraft at this point. Instead, what the Ukrainian Air Force lacks is air-launched weapons. Only greater numbers of these, he says, will be able to achieve some kind of parity with Russian airpower capabilities.

Inside Israel’s Commando Raid On Iran’s Underground Missile Facto...	The Israeli Ministry of Defense has released details — and imagery — of a dramatic commando raid into Syria, which targeted an underground missile production facility, back in September. The raid, codenamed Operation Many Ways, was deemed an outstanding success, with the facility destroyed and none of the 120 Israeli special forces troops involved being injured. Until now, however, very few details of how the raid took place had emerged. The raid was carried out on September 8 by members of the Israeli Air Force (IAF), specifically its elite Shaldag unit and Unit 669. Shaldag is a clandestine outfit that specializes in long-range penetration operations, including commando-style raids. Unit 669 is tasked primarily with combat search and rescue (CSAR), a key requirement of missions carried out in or close to hostile territory. The target of Operation Many Ways was, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) say, an Iranian-run missile manufacturing site, codenamed Deep Layer by the Israeli military, part of the Scientific Studies and Research Center (SSRC) network. A satellite image of the Deep Layer facility. IDF What the Israeli Ministry of Defense described as 'precision-guided missiles' and long-range rockets were planned to be made here and then supplied to Hezbollah in Lebanon as well as to the Assad regime in Syria. In terms of Iranian support for Hezbollah, Deep Layer was Iran’s 'flagship project,' according to the IDF. The IDF says the target was surveilled with 'extensive intelligence gathering and monitoring' and a plan for its destruction reportedly started to take shape 'months' ahead of the operation. Fascinating, apparently the Masyaf site was an underground facility for producing and casting solid propellant rocket motors. First such site I have seen, apart from some more primitive Hamas ones. pic.twitter.com/X62kY5rmMs&mdash; Fabian Hinz (@fab_hinz) January 2, 2025 Fitting its name, Deep Layer was located deep underground, buried within a mountain in the Masyaf area of Syria, west of Hama. Reportedly situated between 230 and 430 feet below the ground, the facility was considered more or less impregnable by IAF airstrikes. But destroying it using a commando raid was also a huge challenge since its location was more than 124 miles north of the Israeli border, and around 28 miles from Syria’s western coastline. IAF personnel oversee the raid from a command center in Israel. IDF As to the layout of the facility, the IDF says it was horseshoe-shaped, with an entrance in the side of the mountain where raw materials went in, and an exit nearby from where the completed missiles emerged. There was also a third entrance used for logistics and to reach offices inside the facility. Along the horseshoe were at least 16 rooms where missile and rocket motor assembly took place. A rendering of the underground tunnel network. IDF At the time of the raid, the facility was not yet working at full capacity, construction work having begun here in late 2017. However, according to the IDF, at least two missiles had been successfully manufactured as part of testing, and rocket engines were already being mass-produced. Ultimately, it was expected that the facility would be able to produce between 100 and 300 missiles of various kinds annually. A satellite image of the facility, with details of the buildings overlaid using computer-generated imagery, in a graphic released by the IDF. IDF The soldiers involved in the operation, 100 members of Shaldag and another 20 members of Unit 669, were transported into and out of Syria aboard four CH-53D helicopters, locally named Yasur. Official pictures that have now been released, like the one below, show that military working dogs were also part of the force. Reconnaissance and fire support were provided by undisclosed Israeli fighter jets, as well as vessels of the Israeli Navy. IAF personnel disembark from a CH-53 after the raid. IDF According to the Israeli media, the CH-53s were escorted by a pair of AH-64 attack helicopters, while other air assets included 21 fighters, 14 reconnaissance aircraft, and five drones, among others. Meanwhile, 30 more aircraft were on standby in Israel to respond if the operation began to go wrong. 'The six helicopters flew over the Mediterranean Sea far off the coast of Lebanon, before crossing into Syria above its own coastline,' The Times of Israel reports. 'The choppers flew unusually low in order to evade Syrian radars and air defense systems.' IAF personnel discuss the raid after returning to Israel. IDF The Syrian air defense systems around the facility were, the IDF determined, the second-most densely concentrated in Syria, surpassed only by Damascus, although at least some had already been knocked out by IAF airstrikes and had not been repaired or replaced. Reportedly, it took the helicopters only 18 minutes to reach the facility after they had crossed the Syrian coastline, and none were detected. Concurrent with their arrival, IAF fighters and drones along with missile-armed Israeli Navy vessels hit targets both related to the facility and elsewhere in Syria. The strikes on other targets were intended to serve as a deception, to mask the objective of the commando raid, were it to be detected. Although the helicopters were apparently not detected by local air defenses, Israeli reports indicate that 'dozens' of Syrian soldiers began to head to the facility, suggesting that they must have been alerted to the operation, although perhaps only after the commandos had landed. To hamper any Syrian response, strikes also targeted roads in and out of the facility. The first of the CH-53s put troops down very close to the entrance to the facility and once all four had dropped off the troops the helicopters moved to landing zones nearby and waited for the mission to be completed. The Unit 669 members remained on the aircraft, waiting for the call to action if any of the commandos were injured. The view out of the rear ramp of one of the CH-53s involved in the raid. IDF The operation is said to have involved the first team of commandos securing the area while a second team advanced toward the entrance, killing two guards. Meanwhile, another team took up a position on a nearby hill, from where they operated a small drone. This drone was reportedly equipped not only for surveillance, but was also armed, so it could 'eliminate anyone approaching the facility.' Within an hour, the first team of commandos had broken through one of the entrances, which were protected by heavy doors. Further internal doors were opened using nearby forklifts. Indeed, at least some of the commandos underwent forklift driver training, for just this eventuality. This mission was forklift-certified pic.twitter.com/CiuAA56fbt&mdash; ELINT News (@ELINTNews) January 2, 2025 As well as forklifts on site, the commandos used a quad bike they had brought with them to move explosives around the tunnels. In all, 50 commandoes were involved in planting explosive devices, while the other 50 waited outside to provide surveillance and offer covering fire. Meanwhile, IAF fighters continued to hit targets, dropping 49 munitions in total during the raid, although not all were around the facility. IAF commandos in one of the tunnels at the facility during. the raid. IDF After around 660 pounds of explosives had been rigged up, a remote detonator was planted at the site entrance, and the 100 commandos moved to the original landing site, where the same helicopters picked them up. As they boarded, the explosives were triggered. In all, the IDF assesses that its soldiers killed 30 guards and Syrian soldiers during the operation, while Syrian media reported 14 dead and 43 wounded. According to the IDF, the operation was completed with the commandos involved having spent a little over 2.5 hours on the ground in Syria. Members of the IAF leadership discuss the outcome of the raid with some of the commandos involved. IDF 'During the operation, the forces reached critical machinery for manufacturing precision missiles, including a planetary mixer, numerous weapons, and intelligence documents, which were transferred for investigation,' the IDF disclosed. 'The soldiers destroyed the compound and safely returned to Israeli territory.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu commented on the operation in Syria: 'I salute our heroic fighters for the daring and successful operation deep in Syria. This was one of the most important preventive operations that we have taken against the efforts of the Iranian axis to arm itself in order to attack us; it attests to our boldness and determination to take action everywhere to defend ourselves.' IAF commandoes after their return to Israel from the Syria raid last September. IDF Israel destroyed a secretive missile production facility in northwest Syria in September 2024, in an attack that included inserting special operations forces by helicopter to retrieve equipment and documents. IDF IDF Operation Many Ways took place when Syria was still ruled by Bashar al-Assad and before Israel launched its campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon. After the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria, it seems that Israel has decided that it can publicize details of the commando raid. This will also serve as a warning of potential further operations directed against Iran and its proxies in the region. The fact that the operation demonstrated Israeli willingness and capacity to launch such raids against deeply buried and highly defended bunkers sent a signal to Iran, which is a key takeaway we highlighted when the first mention of the special operations raid emerged. While executing a similar operation against an underground target in Iran would be far more complex and risky, this has always been a real possibility and Israel has proven itself more than capable of operating within Iran's borders. More recently, Prime Minister Netanyahu has spoken of a changing order in the region, with two of Iran’s key proxies there, Hamas and Hezbollah, deeply degraded and the Assad regime eliminated, stating: 'After Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Assad regime in Syria, the Houthis are almost the last remaining arm of Iran’s axis of evil. The Houthis are learning, and will learn the hard way, that those who strike Israel will pay a very heavy price for it.'

This clearly includes special operations raids against very hardened underground facilities well beyond Israel's borders.

U.S. Reportedly Setting Up New Base In Northern Syria	A half dozen years after abandoning Kobani, U.S. forces are reportedly building a base in this northern Syrian city on the Turkish border that has been riven by strife between the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and Turkish-backed forces. This all comes as a new Syrian government is trying to establish control over the country after ousting Bashar al-Assad. Several videos and images have emerged on social media claiming to show U.S. troops and equipment heading toward Kobani, reportedly to build a new international coalition base. The U.S. has a presence of about 2,000 troops in Syria, ostensibly deployed to continue the ongoing fight against ISIS. That fight apparently came to the U.S. on Wednesday, when a man claiming an ISIS affiliation carried out a deadly attack in New Orleans.

'SOHR activists have reported seeing the convoy on Al-Hasakah-Al-Raqqah highway, while it was heading to Ain Al-Arab area (Kobani) in the eastern countryside of Aleppo. The convoy was accompanied by a military vehicle of SDF. According to SOHR sources, this comes as a part of US forces’ efforts to boost their bases and establish a new military base in Ain Al-Arab in light of the growing security and military tension in that region.' The international coalition forces 'brought a convoy of logistic reinforcements including premade chambers, surveillance cameras, cement blocks, fuel tanks and digging machinery towards Kobani,' SOHR added. '&#8230;the digging and drilling will start tomorrow and more military reinforcements such as soldiers, weapons, armored vehicles, radars, and anti-aircraft weapons will be brought.' This assessment was shared by the pro-SDF North Press media outlet. 'The U.S.-led Global Coalition began on Thursday establishing a military base in the city of Kobani, northern Syria,' the publication reported. 'North Press correspondent documented trucks transporting concrete blocks to Kobani for the base’s construction.' The convoy 'included logistical supplies such as prefabricated rooms, surveillance cameras, trench-digging equipment, concrete blocks, and fuel tanks,' North Press added.

We will update this story with any information provided. After pulling out of the Kobani area, the U.S. military announced that a pair of U.S. Air Force F-15E Strike Eagles had struck the defunct Lafarge Cement Factory in northern Syria, on Oct 16, 2019. This facility sits along the highly strategic M4 highway between the cities of Ain Issa and Kobani, and had served as the 'headquarters of the de facto Defeat-ISIS coalition in Syria,' U.S. Army Col. Myles Caggins, the chief spokesperson for the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS in Syria and Iraq, said on Oct. 15, 2019. The base was used extensively to support special operations and included landing pads for multiple helicopters. It is unclear if this is the facility the U.S. is reportedly trying to build up now. After the U.S. departed the facility, Russian forces took it over and remained there until pulling most of its troops out of Syria in the wake of the Assad ouster. You can see that site in a satellite image obtained by The War Zone at the time. The former U.S. base at the defunct Lafarge Cement Factory in northern Syria as of Oct. 22, 2019.

At the core of the issue is Turkey’s long-standing contention that SDF is functionally indistinguishable from the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK. Both the United States and Turkey have designated the PKK, which has operated in Turkey, northern Syria, and northern Iraq, as a terrorist group. However, the U.S. government insists that PKK and SDF are separate organizations. The claimed U.S. build-up in Kobani comes as fighting continues between the SDF and Turkish-backed forces continues in northern Syria.

Kurdish journalist Rohat Baran emphasized that these sites are not just vital for the local population but also hold broader regional importance in terms of trade, energy, and military operations. The Qara Quzak Bridge is a pivotal location along the M4 international trade route, a corridor connecting key areas such as Kobani, Raqqa and Manbij, Baran noted. 'This route is essential for logistics, commerce, and defense in northern Syria,' he reported. 'The Tishreen Dam, meanwhile, supplies electricity to vast parts of northern Syria, including Aleppo, Deir ez-Zor, and al-Hasakah. Losing control of these sites could have catastrophic consequences for the region’s infrastructure and security.' 'The defense of Tishreen and Qara Quzaq is not merely local but encompasses the security of Kobani, Raqqa, and the broader&#8230;region,' Baran continued. Turkish strikes escalate over strategic northern Syria sites Turkey’s strikes on Tishreen (Tişrîn) Dam and Qara Quzak (Qere Qozaq) Bridge intensify.

'&#8230;we have been conducting various strikes against ISIS leaders, but in terms of our partnership with SDF, nothing has changed there,' Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters on Monday. Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III spoke by phone today on Dec. 24 with Turkish Minister of National Defense Yaşar Güler 'to discuss the ongoing situation in Syria,' the Pentagon said in a statement. 'Secretary Austin emphasized that close and continuous coordination is crucial to maintaining the ongoing success of the D-ISIS mission. The Secretary and Minister Güler also discussed the importance of setting the conditions to enable a more secure and stable Syria.' Meanwhile, Syria's new leadership is working to solidify its hold on the country since overthrowing Assad nearly a month ago and says it wants to include SDF in that effort. The head of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the former al-Qaida-linked group that staged the coup against Assad and now runs the country, met with the SDF on Tuesday for the first time since the overthrow. The results of the discussions between SDF and Ahmed al-Sharaa, now the de-facto leader of Syria, were 'positive,' the BBC noted. Al-Sharaa, also known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, confirmed that the transitional administration is in talks with the SDF to resolve the crisis in northeastern Syria, with the aim of eventually integrating the SDF into the national armed forces, the Al Arabiya news outlet reported. He reaffirmed that Kurds are an integral part of Syria’s fabric, ruling out any plans for partition. 'There will be no division of Syria in any way,' al-Sharaa told the publication in an interview. 'Negotiations are ongoing with the SDF to resolve the crisis in northeastern Syria,' al-Sharaa explained, adding that the new government would not allow Syria to become a launching pad for PKK attacks.

If the past is prologue, this may be a short-lived move after Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. As we reported at the time, Trump shocked SDF by announcing a withdrawal of U.S. forces from Kobani in 2019. Trump had already stated his intention to eventually pull out all U.S. forces from Syria in December 2018. Despite Trump's wishes, the U.S. kept troops in Syria throughout his first administration. In 2021, White House Coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa Brett McGurk noted in the following tweet that Russian troops took over the Kobani facility after the U.S. withdrawal. As the anti-Assad rebels were advancing across Syria, Trump offered some insight into how he might approach the presence of U.S. troops there in his new administration. 'Syria is a mess, but is not our friend, & THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT,' he exclaimed. 'LET IT PLAY OUT. DO NOT GET INVOLVED!' As for the potentially ISIS-related attack in New Orleans, a truck driven by Army veteran Shamsud-Din Jabbar allegedly drove into a crowd, killing at least 15 people. Investigators later found an ISIS flag in that truck. During a press briefing on Thursday, deputy assistant director of the FBI's counterintelligence division Christopher Raia said Jabbar stated in a post on Facebook that he had joined ISIS last summer, CBS News reported. Shortly before the attack, 'He posted several videos to an online platform proclaiming his support for ISIS,' Raia said. He added that at this point, there was no definitive link between the New Orleans attack and the detonation of a Tesla Cybertruck full of fireworks and other explosive material outside the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas hours later, an event that is being considered a possible act of terrorism. There is no way to know at the moment how this attack will affect Trump's calculus on how many troops should remain in Syria, where they will deploy, or if he will keep the new base in Kobani, if need it is established. Regardless, America's battle against ISIS continues.

Ukraine’s Su-25s Seen Launching Hammer Rocket-Boosted Bombs For T...	For the first time, Ukraine has released an official video, which is embedded below, showing its Su-25 Frogfoot ground-attack jets employing French-supplied Hammer rocket-boosted precision-guided munitions. The compilation, showing multiple launch angles, reinforces the importance of the weapon to the Ukrainian Air Force, especially when it comes to precisely engaging Russian targets, including those located further back from the front lines. The video montage from the Ukrainian Air Force focuses on the Su-25s of the 299th Tactical Aviation Brigade (299 BrTA) as they attack Russian targets in daylight with the Hammer — also known by the French name Armement Air-Sol Modulaire (AASM; Modular Air-to-Ground Armament). At least 10 different sorties are shown, with the weapons being released in pairs, although only two individual Su-25s — the single-seaters with the Bort numbers '28 Blue' and '47 Blue' — can be identified. All the aircraft in the video have blue and yellow identification panels painted on, to help avoid ‘friendly fire’ incidents, and at least some of the launches are made simultaneous with the release of infrared countermeasures, to spoof hostile heat-seeking missiles. A pair of Hammer munitions fall away after launch from a Ukrainian Su-25. Ukrainian Air Force screencap The Hammer is the first Western precision-guided munition of any kind known to be used by the Ukrainian Su-25 — its integration on the Frogfoot was revealed by a Ukrainian Air Force official in June 2024, as TWZ reported at the time. That the Hammer is being used extensively in combat by Ukraine is no surprise — after all, France previously committed to supplying Kyiv with up to 50 of the precision-guided bombs every month. In November last year, France said that it would deliver 600 of the munitions to Ukraine by the end of 2024, with the Hammers being sourced from existing, aging stocks, with plans in the works to quickly produce more. 'The production of AASM bombs must be significantly accelerated in order to renew the [French] stocks with new munitions,' the French National Assembly Defense Committee stated. 'The Ministry of the Armed Forces now aims to produce 1,200 by 2025.' The weapons are also used by Ukrainian Air Force MiG-29 Fulcrum fighters, and it was on one of these jets that we first got a close-up look at the weapon and its specially adapted launch pylon. The Ukrainian Su-27 Flanker fighter may also use the weapon. A Hammer munition on the specially adapted pylon under the wing of a Ukrainian MiG-29. via X As we have explained in the past, the baseline 250-kilogram (551-pound) version of the Hammer has a standoff range of around 43 miles, putting it roughly on par with the U.S.-made Joint Direct Attack Munition-Extended Range, or JDAM-ER, also used by Ukraine. Unlike the JDAM-ER, however, the French munition doesn’t only rely on a pop-out wing kit to extend its range but is also fitted with a solid-fuel rocket. It should be noted that Hammer munitions can also be employed in an unpowered mode, providing a much-reduced range — if desired. The video compilation doesn’t appear to show any of the munitions underway in powered mode, but since they are all seen very soon after release, it’s likely that their motors simply hadn’t yet fired. As well as the tail-mounted range-extension kit, Hammer adds a nose-mounted guidance section to a NATO-standard ‘dumb’ bomb. All types of Hammer munition have a GPS-assisted inertial navigation system (INS) package that is designed to strike specific fixed target coordinates. There also exist multi-mode guidance options that add either imaging infrared or semi-active laser homing, allowing the weapon to engage moving targets as well as enhancing overall accuracy. This also offers alternative guidance options in GPS-denied environments, which would be particularly relevant on the Ukrainian battlefield. A display depicting different guidance options for the Hammer. Safran However, none of the munitions shown in the 299 BrTA video appear to have the transparent nose associated with the imaging infrared or semi-active laser homing options. This is also in keeping with the Hammers that we have previously seen attached to Ukrainian MiG-29s. The bombs shown are also all 250-kilogram weapons, although Hammer can also be used to adapt 125-kilogram (276-pound), 500-kilogram (1,102-pound), and 1,000-kilogram (2,202-pound) bombs. A graphic showing the core components of the Hammer weapon. Safran The bombs seen in the video all show evidence of a thermal protective coating designed to help delay them from ‘cooking off’ in the event of a fire, something that is otherwise frequently seen on U.S. Navy aircraft ordnance. Also noteworthy is the pylon that the Su-25 uses to launch the Hammer. This is the same as previously seen on the MiG-29 which you can read more about here. A closer view of a Hammer munition with its range-extending wings popping out after launch from a Ukrainian Su-25. Ukrainian Air Force screencap Suffice it to say, the pylon is of a specialized type, sharing the same general form as the one Ukrainian MiG-29s have been using together with U.S.-supplied JDAM-ER glide bombs and which is designed to providing GPS-assisted initial positioning data to their guidance systems just prior to launch. These pylons have a prominent protrusion with a GPS antenna at the forward end. As we have noted in the past, mounting this device on a protrusion will help ensure it has a clear line of sight to the GPS satellite constellation and is not shadowed by the aircraft’s wing structure. A clearer view of the Hammer pylon under the wing of the Su-25 with the protrusion at the front mounting a capped antenna. Ukrainian Air Force screencap Not visible in the video are the other changes that will have been made to accommodate the French-made weapon, specifically the cockpit interface. However, we know by now that Ukraine employs Western-supplied precision-guided munitions via an ad-hoc control system that utilizes iPads or similar tablet-like devices installed in the cockpits.

Photo by Libkos/Getty Images The appearance of the new video underscores what we already knew about the Hammer, namely that it provides the Ukrainian Air Force with a valuable option for conducting precision strikes beyond the front lines while reducing the risks to the launch platforms. The Hammer needs to be released at higher altitudes to get the most reach, although the weapons drops in the video are from a fairly low altitude, making use of a pop-up maneuver to get more range — whether in combination with the rocket booster or in unpowered mode. A graphic provides a highly schematic look at the different employment options for Hammer, including launching it up and over terrain at its target. Safran Based on information from the manufacturer, the Hammer, using its rocket booster, can strike targets at least nine miles away even when released at very low altitudes where the aircraft employing it can better hide from enemy air defenses. The weapon can also be lobbed over terrain, providing a further degree of protection to the launch aircraft. All of this is of particular importance to the pilot of the Su-25, whose mount — due to its relatively low speed and limited agility — is at particular risk from the ever-present threat of Russian air defenses. As for the booster, as well as additional range, this ensures that the Hammer impacts the weapon with a higher energy state than its glide bomb counterparts, meaning it can penetrate further into certain hardened targets. A video shows a MiG-29 employing Hammer using low-altitude toss-bombing techniques that make good use of the munition’s unique design: Footage reportedly showing Ukrainian MiG-29 fighter jet firing French-supplied AASM-250 Hammer guided bombs at a target in Belgorod Oblast of Russia.Notice the very low altitude from which the munitions are being launched.Geolocated impact point: Nekhoteevka border crossing,… pic.twitter.com/mGGuqRAmyK&mdash; Status-6 (Military & Conflict News) (BlueSky too) (@Archer83Able) June 27, 2024 The Su-25 has suffered considerable losses in Ukrainian service (as well as in Russian hands) since the current conflict began. According to the Oryx open-source tracking group, 20 Ukrainian Frogfoot losses can be visually confirmed, with the potential for further attrition on top of this. Nevertheless, with a dire need for tactical airpower, Ukraine has continued to make use of the Su-25, including adapting it to use other Western-made weapons, albeit unguided ones. In the past, we have discussed the use of U.S.-supplied 5-inch Zuni air-launched rockets by Ukrainian Su-25s, although there have been reports that the stocks of these older weapons have now been exhausted. Now, the availability of Hammer munitions means that the Frogfoot still has a useful role to play, despite the very high threat level over the battlefield. A series of photos show Zuni unguided rockets being prepared for arming Ukrainian Su-25s. via X By now, Western-provided precision strike weapons are a familiar feature of the arsenals of Ukraine’s Soviet-era jets, something that would have been almost unthinkable before the start of the full-scale Russian invasion in February 2022. With the F-16 multirole fighter now in Ukrainian service, this might well be the next platform to emerge armed with Hammer. This would have the added benefit of a weapons integration process that is much more straightforward than on Ukraine’s older combat jets, with their need for specially tailored pylons and weapons interfaces as part of ad-hoc solutions.

Chinese Underwater Sea Glider Drone Caught By Fisherman In The Ph...	Authorities in the Philippines are examining what appears to be a Chinese ocean glider-type uncrewed underwater vehicle (UUV) that a fisherman 'caught' earlier this week. At least three similar, if not identical undersea drones were found in various locations around Indonesia between 2019 and 2020. The design looks to be one ostensibly intended for maritime research use, but that could also have military applications. A fisherman recovered the UUV approximately six miles (nine kilometers) off the coast of the San Pascual municipality in Masbate, an island province in the Philippines that lies in the central section of the archipelago nation, on December 30, 2024. The drone, which is said to be around six and a half feet (two meters) long, was turned over first to the Philippine National Police (PNP) and then to the Philippine Navy. A view of the glider-type UUV in PNP custody. PNP Bicol A map showing the general location of the San Pascual municipality in Masbate province in the Philippines. Google Maps The predominantly yellow-painted UUV has a torpedo-esque main body with a single fin and stinger-like protrusion at the rear end. There are also two larger wing-like fins, which are black, attached to the body. Pictures the PNP has released show 'HY-119' and 'HY-L0119' markings on the rear of the drone. The HY-L0119 marking is visible in this picture of the glider-type UUV. PNP Bicol 'Based on our open-source research in the internet… HY-119 refers to a Chinese underwater navigation and communication system,' PNP Bicol regional director Brigadier General Andre Dizon told AFP. 'It has an antenna and an eye that can be used for viewing. Based on our research, this can be used for monitoring and reconnaissance.' Pictures, seen below, do show an aperture or port on top of the nose end of the UUV, as well as what may be rows of smaller ones behind it. There is no obvious propulsion system, which we will come back to momentarily. Another view of the glider-type UUV. PNP Bicol PNP Bicol The UUV recovered near San Pascual looks virtually identical, at least externally, to ones that fishermen in Indonesia recovered on at least three separate occasions between 2019 and 2020. The drones found around the Philippines and Indonesia also have very strong similarities to the Chinese Sea Wing ocean glider-type UUV, which the state-run Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) developed more than a decade ago. Underwater drones of this type use an internal system to alter their buoyancy, repeatedly diving and then surfacing to move forward in the water, aided by the fins along the body and at the tail. Past Chinese state media reports have claimed that Sea Wing can operate for up to 30 days and dive down to a depth of nearly four miles.

As TWZ has noted in the past, these are common tasks for glide-type drones, which are also in service with the U.S. Navy and other military and civilian organizations globally. Sea Wing unmanned undersea vehicles arrayed in front of a Chinese Academy of Sciences research ship. Chinese Academy of Sciences Glider-type UUVs, in general, are also known to be employed for hydrographic survey work and to otherwise support the creation of underwater maps. Having highly accurate charts detailing the contours of the seabed has obvious military utility, especially for submarine operations. Underwater gliders can be used to support other kinds of military activities, as well. For instance, the U.S. Navy has said in the past that it uses these kinds of UUVs to help 'service' fixed underwater sonar sensor 'fields.' However, UUVs of this type do offer far more limited capabilities overall than more advanced underwater drones that have been and continue to be developed and fielded, including by China, in recent years. It is also worth noting that the line between civilian research capabilities and military ones is often muddled in general in China. The country's state-run civilian scientific and engineering organizations like CAS and its subdivisions have close ties directly to the People's Liberation Army (PLA). It does remain unknown what the UUV recovered near San Pascual was doing at the time, as well as whether it was operational or had stopped functioning and drifted there from somewhere else. At the same time, as was the case with the ones that fishermen 'caught' around Indonesia years ago, its appearance, especially in waters well within the bounds of the Philippines archipelago, has real potential national security implications. The PNP itself has made this clear. All of this is only further underscored by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy's (PLAN) own brief seizure of a U.S. Navy glider-type underwater drone in the hotly contested South China Sea back in December 2016. A stock picture of a US Navy glider-type UUV. USN 'The recovery of the HY-119 system has significant implications, as it provides insights into advanced underwater technology and naval capabilities,' the statement from the PNP's Bicol office adds. 'Authorities are closely examining the device as to its origin and to assess its potential impact on national security and maritime operations.' The Philippines could well reach out to allies and partners, especially the United States, to further assist with its ongoing investigation. The U.S. military and the U.S. Intelligence Community have particularly robust so-called Foreign Materiel Exploitation (FME) enterprises that specialize in gleaning a wide variety of information on capabilities and other aspects of captured or otherwise acquired non-American systems.

The recovery of the UUV near San Pascual also comes at a time of particularly heightened geopolitical friction between China and the Philippines, primarily over Beijing's widely rejected claims to virtually all of the South China Sea. Last year saw especially aggressive actions on the part of the Chinese Coast Guard and Maritime Militia ships over Scarborough Shoal, which an international tribunal affirmed as belonging to the Philippines in 2016. Chinese authorities continue to ignore that ruling. In the meantime, authorities in the Philippines have stressed that if anyone finds any more underwater drones or other similar objects that they should not touch them and immediately contact the PNP.

How Sailor Poets Take Over U.S. Navy Deck Logs On New Year’s Day	The deck log of a commissioned U.S. Navy ship is generally not the place to mess around. In that humble book, a ship’s officer of the deck (OOD) meticulously notes vital information on weather, sea state, the status of the engineering plant, the ship’s course and speed, along with other mission-critical factors. But in the earliest hours of New Year’s Day, during the mid-watch from midnight to 3 a.m. or 4 a.m., the OOD can let their respective poetic prowess shine through, and write their deck log entry in poem form. The New Year’s deck log entry is a tradition that dates back nearly a century, to 1929, according to the Navy. Sometimes, the OOD will hand the deck log poem duties to another sailor who has a bit more writerly flair. It arguably reached its height during the Vietnam War, when deck log poems became so popular that Navy Times held an annual contest to feature the best of the bunch, according to the National Archives. But as writing increasingly takes a back seat to the phone and other electronic mediums, this Naval tradition has been in decline, and fewer than 20 ships in the nearly 300-ship fleet penned a mid-watch verse as of 2017. But it’s a cool tradition nonetheless, and we are glad to bring you a selection of deck log poems from Navy bridges over the years. Check out the U.S. Naval History and Heritage Command to read more New Year’s Naval poetry from throughout the years too. All the best to you and yours. We’ll see you next year. Quartermaster Seaman Isaiah Kiel reads a New Year's poem as Quartermaster Seaman Dalton Rodgers enters it as the first official deck log entry of 2019 aboard the amphibious assault ship USS Kearsarge (LHD-3) in 2019. (U.S. Navy) USS Gilmer (DD-233), 1942 The Navy destroyer USS Gilmer (DD-233). (U.S. Navy) The ship: This destroyer went right to work in the Pacific after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, conducting submarine patrols and escort duties. It went into a Washington state yard in late 1942 to become a fast transport ship, and was in the Pacific Northwest when Lt. j.g. L.C. Brogger penned his ship’s New Year’s deck log entry. The USS Gilmer's (DD-233) New Year's deck log poem for 1942. (U.S. Navy) The poem: We’re anchored in Port Townsend, With the anchor at short stay. Ready for any emergency, In a minute to get underway. Point Wilson bears three sixteen true From where the anchor lies; The bearing of the light-on-dock Is two seven nought, likewise. The chain is thirty fathoms long The water, seven deep; The Skipper’s in his nice soft bunk Deep in a New Year’s sleep. He hasn’t had one like it For this is the thirtieth day, We’ve hunted Nippon submarines From their base at Crescent Bay. We haven’t found a single one, Despite what fliers say; Their logs and roots and trees and stumps Have kept us underway. Young Blatz is on the sound gear, And Bowles is on the phones, Sheller’s on a machine gun But his thoughts are on his home. ‘Tis the night before New Years And all through the ship Not a creature is stirring Except Judkins – the drip. He’s breaking in the galley To rustle up some Joe, ‘Cause the wind is blowing briskly And the temperature is low. Morton’s in the engine room Keeping his turbines hot. The Boatswain’s Mate is Coxswain Rink Sleeping – like as not. I’ve tried to rhyme my log today But the Navigator’s sure to say, 'Write it up in the regular way.' USS Thresher (SSN-593), 1963 The submarine USS Thresher (SSN-593). (U.S. Navy) The submarine: The first of its class, Thresher’s story is a tragic one, as the boat sunk at sea in April 1963, mere months after this deck log poem was written. All 129 officers, sailors and civilian technicians on board died. It was also the world’s first nuclear-powered submarine to be lost at sea. To this day, Thresher serves as a grim reminder of how dangerous it is to serve in the Navy’s Silent Service. Still, Lt. J.S. Lyman brought the sailor sarcasm big time at the top of his poem. 'This entry is dedicated to the unknown, unrated and unnecessary yeoman at NavPers who so faithfully and capably reads, notes, files and forgets my continuing and constant efforts through the year,' Lyman wrote. The poem: Now read, good yeoman, and you shall see How THRESHER met the best year yet and first of ‘63 The temperature was zero or maybe just below And the winds whistled sharply, from stern to open bow. The skies were clear, although to the waters west Appeared a few broken clouds, call it 'Scattered' at best. It hardly bears repeating – you must know as well as I That THRESHER lies in Dry Dock just as high and dry As on previous days weeks months (Forgive the crossovers, please, yeo, just this once) Not a soul is missing, we’ve mustered our whole flock The ship still stands, with all hands, in #2 Dock Or did you believe that we might leave Our protected spot on New Years’ Eve? Still receiving AC power, as reported before With miscellaneous services brought from the shore. Units of the Fleets, Atlantic and Reserve Are still joined with us in our private preserve. At dock or on block, moored with wire or manila hemp Spring line or breast line, we’re all at PORTSMOUTH, New Hamp. There has been no demotion, or significant promotion In this misbegotten, all but forgotten corner of the ocean And the most rank of us on AEOLUS is SOPA still you see. (Lest you forget, the number yet, remains as ARC-3.) Thus ends my missive for tonight, the very first this year Through past performance indicates, not the very last I fear! USS Farragut (DDG-99), 2024 The Navy destroyer USS Farragut (DDG-99) returns to Naval Station Mayport, Florida, in February following a deployment. (U.S. Navy) The ship: Flash-forwarding to our last New Year, the Navy has continued a deck log poem contest, and this entry from Quartermaster 2nd Class (SW) Anthony Bentley took the top prize, scoring the sailor an engraved piece of USS Constitution, aka Old Ironsides, as well as a certificate and a commander’s coin. Hopefully Bentley got some rest too, those mid-watch shifts must be brutal. Rested or not, QM2 deftly balanced a light, breezy tone while ensuring the essentials were covered. Bravo Zulu! The deck log from the Navy destroyer USS Farragut (DDG-99). (U.S. Navy) The poem: T’was the night before wait; what did I say? Forgive me, I’ve mixed up the wrong holiday. For you see, on the seas, it can get quite mundane. This week alone, thrice, I’ve been called the wrong name! And rank, and rate, and gender no less, But whoosah, breath in, there’s no time to stress. For its New Year’s Day, if you’re wondering when, So with that, let me start over again: Once upon in a time in a land far away We’d returned to fourth fleet for one more underway. 'Catching drug smugglers' the name of the mission, Disguised as small boats supposedly fishin’. Like bloodhounds fresh on a new T.O.I., Flight quarters away and it’s time to fly. LEDET attached always second to none, Simply shining their guns ‘til it’s time for some fun. I’d hate to be smugglers, cuz they’re going to jail. Operating area: the Caribbean Sea, blue, Steaming independently, just the 99 crew. 'We’ll see so many islands!' the Captain did say, But all that we saw was Guantanamo Bay. I must include plant status or they’ll throw a cow, And use my rotting corpse as a temporary brow. So 1A, 1+2 A/C’s running online #1 reefer cooling rations just fine 2B GTM, 1+2 GTG, EMCON Condition Delta, readiness condition III. SWSP 1+2+5 ready, And FP 2+5 Pumping firemain steady. Look at that, worked it all in, oh aren’t I clever? (Though I can’t tell a lie, it took me forever.) With the countdown complete, I can lay to my rack; [Redacted] OOD, keeps the ship right on track. [Redacted], the Conn, eyes forward and keen, Through the night, ensures no contact goes unseen. Dreams of holiday routine, I’ll quickly shelve, For I must be up early for the 09-12. Happy New Year to all from our tropical tour, We look forward to the Yards all 2024. Happy New Year’s, everyone.

Biden Spends Last Of Funds Set Aside To Purchase New Weapons For ...	With three weeks left before President-elect Donald Trump takes office, the Biden administration announced nearly $21 billion in new support for Ukraine. That includes two military aid packages - including the last funds the administration can spend to acquire new weapons for Ukraine. In addition, there is $3.5 billion for direct budgetary assistance to the Ukrainian government and $15 billion in frozen Russian assets. The DoD announced an approximately $1.22 billion Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) package to provide Ukraine with 'additional air defense, air-to-ground, Unmanned Aerial Systems, and other capabilities to fight Russian aggression,' according to the Pentagon. USAI funds are for items that have to be acquired from industry. This package empties that account of funds to procure weapons from industry or partners ahead of the Jan. 20 inauguration of Donald Trump as president. The latest military donations include authorization of a Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) package, with an estimated value of $1.25 billion 'to provide Ukraine additional capabilities to meet its most urgent needs, including missiles for air defense; munitions for rocket systems and artillery; and anti-tank weapons,' the Pentagon said in a statement. This is to send Ukraine weapons currently in U.S. stocks. Unlike USAI money, however, billions remain in the Biden administration's authority to donate these weapons. National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS) (Raytheon/Kongsberg Defense) As we noted earlier this month, the Pentagon was scrambling to allocate about $6.8 billion in funds and authorities before they could dry up under the next administration. With the USAI account emptied and an additional $1.25 billion from the PDA account allocated, that leaves about $4.33 billion left for the Biden administration to directly donate from U.S. weapons stocks to Ukraine. It is unlikely that the entire amount will be spent before the Trump administration takes office, a senior U.S. defense official told reporters, including from The War Zone, earlier this month. 'We will continue to do drawdown packages for the remainder of this administration,' the senior defense official explained at the time. 'But $5.6 billion is a substantial amount of authority, so I would certainly anticipate that there could be remaining authority that would transition and be available for the next administration to use.' The capabilities in this announcement include: • Munitions for National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS);• HAWK air defense munitions;• Stinger missiles;• Counter-Unmanned Aerial Systems (c-UAS) munitions;• Ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS);• 155mm and 105mm artillery ammunition;• Air-to-ground munitions;• High-speed Anti-radiation missiles (HARMs);• Unmanned Aerials Systems (UAS);• Javelin and AT-4 anti-armor systems;• Tube-launched, Optically guided, Wire-tracked (TOW) missiles;• Small arms and ammunition and grenades;• Demolitions equipment and munitions;• Secure communications equipment;• Commercial satellite imagery services;• Medical equipment;• Clothing and individual equipment; and• Spare parts, maintenance and sustainment support, ancillary equipment, services, training, and transportation.

(Ukrainian Air Force Screencap) Since taking office, the Biden administration has provided more than $66 billion in security assistance for Ukraine, according to the Pentagon. '&#8230;my Administration is fully utilizing the funding appropriated by Congress to support the drawdown of U.S. equipment for Ukraine,' Biden said in a statement on Monday. 'I’ve directed my Administration to continue surging as much assistance to Ukraine as quickly as possible — including drawing down older U.S. equipment for Ukraine, rapidly delivering it to the battlefield, and then revitalizing the U.S. defense industrial base to modernize and replenish our stockpiles with new weapons. The Department of Defense is in the process of delivering hundreds of thousands of artillery rounds, thousands of rockets, and hundreds of armored vehicles which will strengthen Ukraine’s hand as it heads into the winter. At my direction, the United States will continue to work relentlessly to strengthen Ukraine’s position in this war over the remainder of my time in office.' Nearly $2.5 billion allocated to Ukraine by the U.S. which includes $1.25 billion drawdown package (PDA) and a $1.22 billion Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) package. NOELREPORTS (@NOELreports) December 30, 2024 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky offered his gratitude for the latest arms packages. 'This support comes at a critical moment, as Russia intensifies its assaults, even resorting to involving North Korean soldiers and continuing to receive weapons from North Korea and Iran,' he said. 'Every act of solidarity from our partners saves lives, strengthens our independence, and reinforces our resilience. It also demonstrates that democracies are stronger then autocratic aggressors. Ukraine deeply appreciates the United States’ steadfast support, especially as we approach the end of this challenging year. The nearly $2.5 billion in security assistance is a crucial contribution that will strengthen our defenders on the frontlines.This support comes at a…&mdash; Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa) December 30, 2024 Ukraine will also receive $3.4 billion in direct budget support, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen announced Monday. 'Our direct budget support to Ukraine arrives at a critical time as Russia intensifies its attacks on Ukrainian civilians and critical infrastructure,' Yellen said in a statement. 'Economic assistance from the United States and our allies is crucial for Ukraine’s ability to defend its sovereignty and achieve a just peace by maintaining the critical government services that underpin its brave fight.' In coordination with the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Department of State, this $3.4 billion in assistance 'marks the final disbursement of funds appropriated under the bipartisan Ukraine Security Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2024,' Yellen explained. 'Our direct budget support continues to be conditioned on reforms related to strengthening law enforcement, improving transparency and efficiency of government institutions, and bolstering anti-corruption rules and procedures.' Economic assistance from the United States and our allies is crucial for Ukraine’s ability to defend its sovereignty and achieve a just peace by maintaining the critical government services that underpin its brave fight. Secretary Janet Yellen (@SecYellen) December 30, 2024 In addition to aiding Ukraine with its own funds, the U.S. will provide it with $15 billion secured by future revenues from frozen Russian assets, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyal announced on Telegram. 'The relevant agreement was signed by the Ukrainian Ministry of Finance and the World Bank,' he explained. 'These will be funds within the framework of the PEACE in Ukraine project and part of the U.S. contribution of $20 billion under the G7 initiative, which will be directed to social and humanitarian spending. We thank the United States and the World Bank for implementing and supporting the initiative that is making Russia pay for its aggression against Ukraine.'

As we have previously noted, there are mixed signals about what his approach toward this war and future funding for Ukraine might be. Some close to Trump have suggested that the front lines be frozen as they are, Ukraine hold off on joining NATO and European troops keep the peace as part of any agreement to end the war. Russian officials, however, dismissed that concept. 'Judging from numerous leaks and Donald Trump’s interview with Time magazine on December 12, their idea is to suspend hostilities along the line of contact and transfer responsibility for confrontation with Russia to the Europeans,' Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Monday. 'We are not happy, of course, with the proposals made by members of the Trump team to postpone Ukraine’s admission to NATO for 20 years and to station British and European peacekeeping forces in Ukraine. Russia’s position of principle regarding the Ukrainian settlement is well known. It has been put forth by President Vladimir Putin on many occasions, including at the December 19 annual news conference. We have always been ready for talks, and we still are.' Russia is dissatisfied with the reported peace deal proposals on Ukraine from U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s team, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Dec. 29, according to state-owned TASS. The Kyiv Independent (@KyivIndependent) December 29, 2024 Given Russia's early reaction to elements of a potential Trump peace plan, there is no telling how he may position the U.S. when it comes time to determining how much aid Ukraine could receive under his administration. In his recent interview with Time, Trump was pressed on whether there will be continued U.S. support for Ukraine in his administration. He offered a clue about his looming approach. 'I want to reach an agreement, and the only way you're going to reach an agreement is not to abandon,' he said. The Latest On the battlefield, amid continuing Russian gains across the eastern front, Ukraine recaptured some territory it lost this year. Here are some key takeaways from the Institute for the Study of War’s (ISW) latest assessment: Kursk: Russian forces continued assaults in the Ukrainian salient in Kursk Oblast on December 28 and 29 but did not make any confirmed advances. Kharkiv: Russian forces continued ground attacks northeast of Kharkiv City near Hatyshche and Vovchansk on December 28 and 29 but did not make any confirmed advances. Luhansk: Russian forces continued offensive operations along the Kupyansk-Svatove-Kreminna line on December 29 but did not make any confirmed advances. Donetsk: Russian forces continued offensive operations in the Siversk direction on December 30 but did not make any confirmed advances. They recently marginally advanced northwest of Kurakhove, toward Vuhledar and near Velyka Novosilka. Ukrainian forces recently regained lost positions in central Chasiv Yar while both sides recently advanced in the Toretsk and Pokrovsk directions. Kherson: Russian forces continued assaults in the Dnipro direction and on the islands in the Dnipro River Delta on December 29 and 30 but did not make any confirmed advances.

'We now assess that North Korean forces are conducting massed, dismounted assaults against Ukrainian positions in Kursk,' John Kirby said on Friday. 'And these human wave tactics that we're seeing haven't really been all that effective. In fact, we assess that they've resulted in heavy casualties for these North Korean forces. Our estimate is that, to date, they have suffered more than 1,000 killed or wounded in this particular fighting in just the past week of them fighting on the front lines.' Russian and North Korean military leaders 'are treating these troops as expendable and ordering them on hopeless assaults against Ukrainian defenses,' Kirby added. 'These North Korean soldiers appear to be highly indoctrinated, pushing attacks even when it is clear that those attacks are futile. We also have reports of North Korean soldiers taking their own lives rather than surrendering to Ukrainian forces, likely out of fear of reprisal against their families in North Korea in the event that they're captured.' BREAKING: The U.S claims that 1,000 North Korean troops have perished in one week in Kursk&mdash; Samuel Ramani (@SamRamani2) December 28, 2024 Greece has agreed to provide Ukraine with 24 RIM-7 Sea Sparrow missiles, the Greek Ekathimerini news outlet reported. 'These missiles, which have been in use for nearly 40 years, are from Greece’s naval and air force stockpiles and have been deemed unnecessary for operational use by Greek military standards,' the publication reported. Back in January 2023, TWZ reported on how Ukraine was set to receive an undisclosed number of radar-guided RIM-7 missiles, to be integrated into the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ existing Buk air defense systems, known as 'Franken-SAMs' due to their cobbled-together nature. This transfer 'is part of Greece’s broader military aid to Ukraine, which includes artillery shells, weaponry and ammunition,' Ekathimerini stated. 'While the assistance aligns with Greece’s commitment to Ukraine’s defense efforts, it does not diminish Greece’s defense capabilities in the Aegean,' the publication noted. 'Despite repeated requests from allies for advanced systems like the S-300 and Patriot missiles, Athens has firmly declined, citing security concerns and the absence of reliable replacement options.' Greece is set to provide Ukraine with 24 RIM-7 Sea Sparrow Anti-Aircraft Missiles. These Missiles, in service with the Greek Navy and Air Force for over 40 years, are now considered obsolete by Greek Military standards.

He thanked the UAE for helping negotiate the exchange. Russia’s Defense Ministry, meanwhile, said that 150 Russian soldiers were freed from captivity as part of the exchange in which each side released 150 people. The reason for the discrepancy is not clear. Yesterday, Ukraine secured the release of 189 people from Russian captivity in a prisoner swap.

It marked the first official Ukrainian delegation to Syria in years. During the trip, he held talks with Syria’s de-facto leader Ahmad Al-Sharaa. 'The first visit of an official Ukrainian delegation to Syria in many years indicates a willingness to open a new page in bilateral relations between the countries,' Sybiha noted on Telegram. 'The elimination of the Russian presence in Syria will contribute to the stability not only of the Syrian state, but also of the entire Middle East and Africa. Even if it takes some time.' Ukraine 'is ready to share with Syria its experience in collecting evidence, investigating, and working to bring war criminals to justice for the crimes they committed,' Sybiha added. In addition, he informed Al-Sharaa that starting Tuesday, 'more than two dozen trucks will arrive in Syria, delivering 500 tons of Ukrainian flour as part of the humanitarian program ‘Grain from Ukraine.’' Ahmad al-Shar’a, Asaad Shaybani, and Anas Katab meets with Ukrainian delegation in Damascus today including Ukraine’s FM Andrii Sybiha.

Zelin (@azelin) December 30, 2024 Ukraine's use of U.S.-made Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) munitions has tailed off, according to The New York Times. The Biden administration shipped Ukraine as many as 500 missiles from Pentagon stockpiles, U.S. officials told the publication. Initially not allowed to use them in Russia, Ukraine began firing them in October 2023 at targets in eastern Ukraine and Crimea held by Russians. The missiles were aimed at hardened command and control posts, weapons storage areas and some other bunkers. Ukraine was finally permitted to fire ATACMS into Russia last month. As we previously reported after Biden gave his go-ahead, the first ATACMS strikes inside Russia took place in the middle of November, at a target in the Bryansk region. At that point, Ukraine had only 'tens of the missiles' left — maybe about 50, the two U.S. officials told the NYT, adding there was no likelihood that Kyiv would get more. 'The limited American supplies had already been assigned for deployment in the Middle East and Asia,' the Times noted. 'Officials in Britain, which allowed Ukraine to use its long-range [Storm Shadow air-based cruise missiles] inside Russia after Mr. Biden’s decision, also said recently that it didn’t have many more to provide.' It is unlikely that Donald Trump will step in to fill the gap when he takes office. He recently told Time magazine that he disagreed 'very vehemently' with Ukraine’s use of ATACMS in Russian territory and called Biden’s decision to provide them 'foolish.' The next day, the Kremlin said Trump’s position 'fully aligned' with Moscow. 'Since the United States and Britain granted permission, Ukraine has launched at least a half-dozen missile strikes, using at least 31 ATACMS and 14 Storm Shadows, according to the Russian Defense Ministry and Russian military bloggers,' the Times explained. 'The Ukrainian military does not comment on the use of the missiles, but neither the United States nor Ukraine has challenged those reports.'

(@Hromadske) December 31, 2024 Ukraine used its new Peklo drone to attack the key Druzhba oil pipeline near the city of Novozybkov in Russia’s Bryansk region, the Russian Mash media outlet reported on Monday. The facility in the village of Mamai, about 35 miles north of the border, was struck Monday at 4:30 a.m. local time, according to Mash. 'The pipeline was not damaged - as a result of the attack, a technical building on the territory was partially destroyed,' Mash stated. 'No one was hurt. The section of the oil pipeline is the last pumping point before the border, Mash noted. 'From there, oil goes to Europe, among other places. The attack came after Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico reminded Ukraine of a possible suspension of electricity supplies. On Dec. 27, Fico announced that his government would evaluate potential reciprocal measures against Ukraine, including halting electricity supplies, if Ukraine stops the transit of Russian gas to Slovakia after January 1. 'After Jan. 1, we will assess the situation and the possibilities of reciprocal measures against Ukraine,' Fico said in a video address. Peklo, which means 'Hell' in Ukrainian, has a reported range of 700 kilometers (435 miles) and can reach speeds of up to 700 kilometers per hour (435 mph).

It’s unclear how widely the shotgun drone has been fielded, however, FPV drones are playing an increasing counter-UAS role for Ukraine. As of late November, a single project involving such drones has accounted for the destruction of over 400 Russian UAVs, including Orlan, Zala, and Lancet loitering munitions, according to the Defense Express news outlet.

The weapon 'is designed to destroy enemy unarmored military equipment and armored personnel carriers, command posts, air defense and missile defense facilities, electronic reconnaissance and electronic warfare, rear support facilities, combat and rear support units and subdivisions, field warehouses for storing ammunition and fuel and lubricants, launch sites for unmanned aerial vehicle systems, and aircraft (helicopters) outside shelters at airfields (sites) of basing,' the company claimed on its website. The catapult-launched KUB-10E has a cruising speed of 100 kmh (about 62 mph) and a flight altitude range from 100 meters (about 328 feet) to 2,500 meters ( about 8.202 feet), Kalashnikov suggested. 'The range and combat power of the new guided munition significantly exceed the performance of previous models in the line,' the company explained. The weapon 'is aimed at specified coordinates, data from the global navigation satellite system (GNSS)&#8230;It can be used at any time of the day, in simple and difficult meteorological conditions, in winds with gusts of up to 15 m/s, in the range of ambient temperatures (at the earth's surface) from -30°C (about -22 F) to 40°C (about 104 F).'

Ukraine Claims Its Drone Boat Shot Down A Russian Mi-8 Helicopter...	Ukraine says it has used an adapted air-to-air missile fired from an uncrewed surface vessel (USV), better known as a drone boat, to down a Russian Mi-8 Hip helicopter over the Black Sea earlier today. While the results of the engagement haven't been independently verified, they have been confirmed by Russian military bloggers, suggesting this is actually the first time that a USV has been used successfully to bring down an aircraft of any kind.

The missile was fired from a Magura V5 USV operated by the Main Directorate of Intelligence's (GUR) Group 13 unit. Another Russian helicopter, type undisclosed, was reportedly damaged and returned to its airfield. The missile in question, an R-73 (AA-11 Archer) air-to-air missile, has now received the name 'Sea Dragon' in its surface-launched naval application. In the video, one of the drone boats can be seen being hosed with machine gun fire, while at least one of the targeted Mi-8s can be seen releasing infrared flares in an effort to evade the heat-seeking missile. A still from the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence video shows a Russian helicopter apparently in the sights of the USV. Ukrainian Ministry of Defense screencap Evidence of Ukraine arming USVs with heat-seeking air-to-air missiles began to emerge in May of 2024, as TWZ reported at the time. The adaptation was apparently made to provide the USVs with a defense against the Russian helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft that are regularly used to counter them, but it also gives the drone boats a new offensive capability — in addition to their primary role of going after Russian warships and other surface vessels. Until now, it was unclear just how practical the extemporized arrangement was. The latest Ukrainian claims suggest it has proven effective on this occasion, although there remain questions about how the weapons actually work, especially in terms of the engagement process. Speaking today, Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, the head of the GUR, confirmed that there had been several previous unsuccessful efforts to engage Russian helicopters using R-73-armed USVs. The smoke trail left by a n R-73 missile as it heads toward its target, as seen in a still from the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence video. Ukrainian Ministry of Defense screencap A large splash shows the apparent demise of the Russian helicopter. Ukrainian Ministry of Defense screencap The R-73 short-range air-to-air missile that is used to arm some of Ukraine's Magura V5 USVs is potentially a capable surface-to-air weapon, too. As we described when the modification first emerged, the high-off-boresight (HOBS) seeker on the R-73 can articulate a considerable distance in any direction: aided by a helmet-mounted sight, the Archer can be launched in air-to-air engagements against targets with off-boresight angles of +/-75 degrees. This gives the R-73 the potential to be a particularly potent, albeit improvised threat for locking onto and engaging dynamic targets with minimal assisting sensors when used in a surface-launched form. Previous photos confirm that a pair of R-73s can be mounted on angled rails attached to the rear of the USV. A still from a Russian Ministry of Defense video shows a single R-73 on one of two angled rails mounted on the rear of the USV. Russian Ministry of Defense screencap It should also be noted that there several precedents for air-to-air missiles — including the R-73 in particular — being adapted for surface launch. The Yemen-based Houthi militants have adapted R-73s for surface launch against aircraft targets, and used them in combat, as you can read about here. The Houthis added a commercial FLIR as part of that extemporized air defense solution, which has been used to great effect, and it would appear Ukraine has adopted a similar approach for its drone boats. A schematic diagram of the R-73 missile. Public Domain Ukraine, too, has adapted the R-73 for ground launch, adding the missile to the Cold War-era, Soviet-made 9K33 Osa (SA-8 Gecko) mobile short-range air defense system (SHORADS). You can read more about that adaptation here. Close-up of an R-73 missile loaded on an Osa-AKM SHORADS vehicle. Come Back Alive Ukraine has plentiful stocks of R-73s — and likely also the older R-60s that could potentially also be adapted for launch from USVs, although the capabilities of these older missiles are inferior overall. The R-73 remains part of the standard armament for Ukrainian Air Force MiG-29 Fulcrum and Su-27 Flanker fighters.

Ultimately, successful use of R-73s fired from USVs could force Russian rotorcraft to operate further from the drone boats they are targeting, even if the probability of kill is not especially high, and the overall range of the missile markedly reduced from the 8.7 miles that can be achieved against a tail-on target when launched (in optimum conditions) in an air-to-air engagement. An R-73 air-to-air missile on display. Black bands on the weapon indicate an inert round. Vitaly V. Kuzmin/Wikimdia Commons The Russian helicopters that appear to be the favoured weapon against the Ukrainian USVs are primarily armed with heavy machine guns, unguided rockets, and potentially anti-tank guided missiles. None of these offer the standoff range that would allow the helicopters to engage USVs before coming within the engagement envelope of the R-73. The wreckage of an R-73 on a Ukrainian USV that was washed ashore and fell into Russian hands earlier this year. via X While we wait for independent verification of the success of the USV in shooting down a Mi-8, there's meanwhile no doubt that the adaptation has the potential to inflict further losses on the Russian military in the Black Sea. In particular, the development complicates Russia's actions when it comes to countering Ukrainian drone boats, providing the USVs with a deterrent and a powerful means of shooting back — more powerful than the machine-gun-armed USVs that we have previously seen in action against Russian helicopters. This is yet another calculus in the fast-evolving drone war in the Black Sea region. Already, Ukrainian USVs have inflicted disproportionate losses on Russian surface vessels operating in the Black Sea. The latest development is a further reminder of the willingness of the Ukrainian Armed Forces to improvise innovative weapons systems and to introduce these relatively rapidly to counter new and emerging threats.

39 A-10 Warthogs Went To The Boneyard This Year, More Than Double...	The U.S. Air Force sent at least 39 A-10s to the boneyard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona this year, more than double the number of Warthogs it sent into mothballs in 2023. The service is pushing steadily ahead with plans to retire the type for good before the end of the decade, if not well before then, though the venerable ground attack aircraft continue to see combat in the interim. An A-10 arrives at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base to be put in the boneyard in July 2024. USAF Data on A-10 retirements come from official monthly inventory reports from the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) released between January and September. The 309th AMARG manages the boneyard and received 17 Warthogs in 2023. There were 50 A-10As and 107 A-10Cs in storage in total, many of which are in non-flyable condition, as of September 2024. How many additional A-10s may have headed into retirement in the past three months is unknown. An example of the condition of some of the A-10s that have been at the boneyard for years now. USAF / J.M. Eddins Jr An example of the condition of some of the A-10s at the boneyard. USAF / J.M. Eddins Jr When Fiscal Year 2024 began on October 1 of last year, there were 218 A-10s in service across the Air Force, according to separate data released back in March as part of the annual U.S. defense budget request rollout. The 39 Warthogs that went to the boneyard this year represent nearly 20 percent of that total. The Air Force currently plans to retire the last of the ground attack jets, which it argues have ever-more limited survivability and general utility, especially in any future high-end operations, such as a conflict in the Pacific against China, no later than 2030. The Air Force only began retiring A-10s in earnest in 2023. For years, members of Congress had actively blocked the retirement of Warthogs, in part over questions about the ability of other aircraft, especially stealth F-35s, to fill in any potential gap in close air support capacity. Some of the debate to date has centered around the impending loss of the A-10's famed seven-barrel 30mm GAU-8/A Avenger Gatling-type cannon. The internally-mounted 25mm cannon on the Air Force's F-35As has also suffered serious issues over the years and whether or not they have been sufficiently resolved is unclear. At the same time, it is worth noting that the ground combat jets' operations have steadily trended toward the employment of precision-guided munitions rather than strafing runs over the past two decades or so. A report from the Pentagon's Office of the Director of Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) on a controversial flyoff between the A-10 and the F-35 conducted between 2018 and 2019 only emerged this year and in a highly redacted form after having been effectively buried. The independent Project on Government Oversight (POGO) only obtained that document, which is dated February 2022, through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request and subsequent ligation. You can read more about the report, which raises more questions than it provides answers in many areas, here. Regardless, the overall view of the A-10 in Congress has clearly shifted in recent years. The most recent annual defense policy bill for the 2025 Fiscal Year, which President Joe Biden signed into law earlier this month, includes a provision explicitly reducing the minimum number of Warthogs that the Air Force has to legally keep in operational service from 135 to 96. The Air Force has already laid out extensive plans for a post-A-10 force structure across its active duty components, as well as the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard. Just in November, the service announced that the 25th Fighter Squadron at Osan Air Base in South Korea would start divesting its 24 Warthogs next month. What will happen to that squadron afterward and what additional aircraft might take their place at Osan is unclear. Osan-based A-10s fly together with a South Korean Air Force KA-1 Woongbi light aircraft. ROKAF Earlier this year, the Air Force formally decided that the Maryland Air National Guard's 175th Wing would lose its Warthogs and gain a non-flying cyber operations mission in return. However, earlier this month, a separate administrative decision was also made to shift the District of Columbia Air National Guard's F-16-equipped 121st Fighter Squadron to the Maryland Air National Guard. Last year, the Air Force had also announced that the active-duty 23rd Wing at Moody Air Force Base in Georgia and the Idaho Air National Guard’s 124th Fighter Wing Gowen Field Air National Guard Base would be trading in their A-10s for F-35s and F-16s, respectively. The face of Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, long itself an A-10 hub, is also set to change as a result of impending Warthog retirements. The base is slated to become home to an expanded 492nd Special Operations Wing flying OA-1K Sky Warden light attack aircraft and MC-130J Commando II special operations tanker/transports. The 492nd, which is currently based at Hurlburt Field in Florida, will support other non-flying Air Force special operations mission sets, as well. The OA-1K Sky Warden. L3Harris This year was also the last season for the A-10C Demonstration Team, reducing the Warthog's role in the Air Force's recruitment and public relations efforts. The Air Force's remaining A-10s have continued to receive some of their most substantial upgrades in recent memory just in the past few years, including the ability to employ GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs (SDB). Many of the Warthogs still in service have also gotten new wings that have added thousands of flight hours to service lives. An A-10 loaded with 16 GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs seen during a test. USAF Despite the ongoing retirement efforts, A-10s are still flying combat missions. Warthogs were among the aircraft sent to the Middle East in October amid fears of further escalation in direct conflict between Israel and Iran and other crises in the region. The ground attack jets have since been actively used just in recent weeks to conduct strikes in Syria amid the new uncertainty in that country following the ouster of longtime dictator Bashar Al Assad. There have been suggestions that the A-10s could serve on with foreign air arms, including those of Jordan and Ukraine, after the U.S. Air Force retires the type for good. At least in the United States, the Warthog's career is more and more firmly in its twilight period, especially with the ramping up of jets heading to the boneyard this year.

The Time Navy Lt. Jimmy Carter Was Lowered Into A Partially Melte...	President Jimmy Carter’s time as a U.S. Navy officer might have been brief, but it served to inform the rest of his days before passing away Sunday at the age of 100. Prior to his political career and Nobel Prize-winning peacemaking efforts, Carter stood at the side of the father of the nuclear Navy during its infancy, and even got lowered into a melted-down nuclear reactor as a junior officer. Decades later, the former president was stunned to learn of the capabilities carried by the secretive spy submarine that bears his name to this day. Ensign James Earl 'Jimmy' Carter graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1946, and applied to join the Navy’s nuclear submarine community a few years later, according to the Navy. Assigned to the experimental attack submarine USS Barracuda (SSK-1), Carter had served as executive officer, engineering officer and electronics repair officer by the time he crossed paths with then-Capt. Hyman G. Rickover, the future admiral widely credited with birthing America’s nuclear sub fleet and ending a Navy practice of naming submarines after fish. Following that interview, Rickover soon tapped Carter to join the nascent effort. On temporary duty with the Naval Reactors Branch to help design and develop nuclear propulsion plants, the junior officer at times struggled to keep up with Rickover’s demanding pace. Former President Jimmy Carter becomes an ensign upon graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1946. (Jimmy Carter Library and Museum) Nonetheless, Carter wrote in his 1975 presidential campaign tome 'Why Not The Best?' about how Rickover left a stark impression on him, as historian Glenn Robins recalled for the U.S. Naval Institute: 'The young Carter was near the end of a two-hour interview with Rickover, which had come to function as a rite of passage for anyone seeking entrance to the Navy’s nascent nuclear submarine program, when Rickover brought up the topic of Carter’s standing at the U.S. Naval Academy. After Carter proudly announced ranking in the top 10 percent of the class of 1947, Rickover pointedly asked, ‘Did you do your best?’ Carter hesitated but answered truthfully that he had not. To which the captain queried, ‘Why not?’' Before becoming the 39th President of the United States Jimmy Carter was a nuclear baddie.He was a U.S. Naval Academy graduate and got handpicked by the iconic Admiral Hyman G.

It prompted Carter 'to undergo a life-changing period of self-reflection that compelled the young sailor ‘to make the maximum effort in every single thing he did for the rest of his life,' Robins wrote. Rickover would go on to provide counsel to President Carter on a variety of topics through the years. President Jimmy Carter, right, and Navy Adm. Hyman G. Rickover during a tour of the attack submarine USS Los Angeles (SSN-688) in 1977. (U.S. Navy) After Carter joined the Navy’s nuclear efforts, the 28-year-old and his crew were sent to repair the Chalk Water nuclear reactor near Ottawa, Canada, in late 1952. The reactor had suffered a partial meltdown, and a team was needed to shut it down, take it apart and replace it. Carter and the rest of the team took a train up north and soon got to work. 'They built an identical replica of the reactor on an adjacent tennis court to precisely run through the repair procedures, due to the maximum time humans could be exposed to the levels of radiation present in the damaged area,' a Navy history recounts. 'Each member of the 22 member team could only be lowered into the reactor for 90-second periods to clean up and repair the site.' Official accounts don’t clarify whether Carter was in command during the mission, or his precise role. Still, the future president did his part, Canadian journalist Arthur Milnes later recounted. 'He was lowered into the building … with his wrench, and he had to run over to the reactor casing and he had one screw to turn,' Milnes said after interviewing Carter about the incident. 'That was all the time he had. And then, boom, back up.' Carter and the others were regularly tested after the mission was finished to look for long-term health effects. 'They let us [crew members] get probably a thousand times more radiation than they would now.' Carter told CNN in 2008 while reflecting on the incident. 'We were fairly well-instructed then on what nuclear power was, but for about six months after that, I had radioactivity in my urine.' Former President Jimmy Carter is piped aboard during his arrival at the change of command ceremony for the Seawolf class attack submarine USS Jimmy Carter (SSN-23) at Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor, Washington, in 2015. (U.S. Navy) In his autobiography, 'A Full Life, Reflections at Ninety,' Carter recounted the distinctive perils of being a submarine officer: 'Although some enlisted men could concentrate almost exclusively on their own fields of responsibility as engine men, electricians, torpedo experts, boatswains, quartermasters, gunners or operators of navigation and fire control equipment, every officer was expected to master all of these disciplines…we knew one mistake could endanger everyone aboard.' Through much of 1953, Carter served as the engineering officer for the USS Seawolf (SSN-575), the Navy’s second nuclear submarine. But life soon happened, and following his fathers death in July of that year, Carter resigned his Navy commission and returned to Georgia to oversee his family interests. The onetime junior officer later entered local politics and was elected president in 1976, serving one term. Decades later, the Seawolf class fast-attack submarine USS Jimmy Carter (SSN-23) was commissioned in 2005. The submarine’s commanding officer, Don Kelso, and a retired Navy admiral arrived at Carter’s Georgia home early that year to brief the 39th president on what the submarine could do, The New York Times’ John Ismay reported. 'He was in awe,' Kelso was quoted as saying. 'He knew it was a special submarine, because he had some background there, but he didn’t know all the details before then of what it could really do.' What the Jimmy Carter and its sailors have done on deployment remains a highly guarded secret within the Pentagon, and The New York Times cited an unnamed former senior Navy official as saying that just a few officers and a few dozen people on land actually know what missions the sub undertakes at sea. The secretive spy submarine USS Jimmy Carter (SSN-23). (U.S. Navy) TWZ has extensively reported on the Jimmy Carter, the other two submarines in its Seawolf class, and why the former president had reason to be awed when briefed on his namesake’s capabilities: 'The Jimmy Carter is the last of only three Seawolf class submarines ever built, but its hullform is different than its sister ships. During construction, it had a large plug placed in the center of its hull, making the boat substantially longer than the other two Seawolf class boats.' 'This plug accommodates room for lockout chambers, underwater remotely operated vehicles, and cargo bays for delivering and retrieving outsized cargo. A slew of other modifications were also made to the vessel. You can read all about them, as well as about the Jimmy Carter in general, in this prior feature profile I wrote about the submarine. Suffice it to say that the USS Jimmy Carter’s primary mission is espionage and spying. It can manipulate communications cables deep under the surface of the ocean and even locate and retrieve sensitive material sitting on the sea floor. It truly is America’s ultimate spying tool, and it can still hunt and fight like a normal Seawolf class fast attack submarine if it has to.' The ship’s crest recognizes the influences on Carter’s life. It features a presidential seal flanked by an atomic energy symbol and a wooden wheel. That wheel pays homage to Carter’s surname, which came from a word meaning 'wheel-maker,' according to The New York Times. The crest’s bottom features the words 'Semper Optima,' Latin for 'always the best,' which was an acknowledgement of Rickover’s formative words to Carter during his time in the sea service. The crest of the Seawolf class attack submarine USS Jimmy Carter (SSN-23) pays homage to the former president's roots. (U.S. Navy) Carter visited his sub’s crew in the summer of 2005, and got underway for an 'overnight V.I.P. cruise' following the boat’s commissioning, The New York Times recounted. 'He drove the ship,' The New York Times quoted Kelso as saying. 'And I remember I was amazed because he must have been 81 at the time, and both he and Mrs. Carter climbed up a 25-foot ladder to get to the top of the submarine’s sail and rode with us as we took the ship out to sea.' 'When we dove, he got to drive from the helmsman’s station down below, and later he went down to the mess decks to meet with the ship’s crew several times,' Kelso added. 'And I think he had a ball.' During his top-secret briefing that year on the Jimmy Carter’s capabilities, The New York Times reported, the former president said his namesake could easily take out the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan (CVN-76), named after the man who beat Carter for the presidency in 1980. Former President Jimmy Carter, center and 87 at the time, sported a proximity suit during a tour of the amphibious assault ship USS Peleliu (LHA-5) in 2012. (U.S. Navy) Carter lived an extraordinary life, by all accounts. His time in the submarine community played a critical role in all that came after, and he remained a Navy man until the end. 'You and I leave here today to do our common duty—protecting our Nation's vital interests by peaceful means if possible, by resolute action if necessary,' Carter told the graduating class of Naval Academy midshipmen in 1978. 'We go forth sobered by these responsibilities, but confident of our strength. We go forth knowing that our Nation's goals—peace, security, liberty for ourselves and for others—will determine our future and that we together can prevail.'

North Korea’s New Warship Appears To Be Designed For Vertical Lau...	North Korea's new warship design has emerged and it appears to be the largest the country has yet constructed. The vessel, which looks to be around the size of a typical modern frigate, or at the least a very large corvette, also appears to be designed to accommodate a vertical launch system (VLS) for missiles, and a phased-array radar, two advanced items not previously seen on a North Korean design. Photos of the new warship, the name of which has not been disclosed, were recently released by North Korea's state-run Korean Central Television (KCTV). The vessel is seen being inspected by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un while under construction in a dry dock at Nampho Shipyard, on the Taedong River estuary, on the west coast of the country. A view of the bow of the vessel, with shipyard officials and Kim in attendance, reveals its impressive size. KCNA The photos are undated, but the oldest shows the construction facility covered by netting, to hide it from view, but this is later seen replaced by a more permanent roof structure. According to NK Pro, which provides data analysis on North Korea, the earliest photo was probably taken before October of this year, since this is when the roof was added. Kim is pictured visiting the new warship under construction, likely in October or some time after. KCNA Imagery analysis from the same outlet suggests that Kim visited the warship under construction on at least one other earlier occasion. Previous photos of the vessel appeared in November, during a defense exhibition in North Korea, but they only showed the bow area and with very limited detail as they can only be seen in wide-angle images released of the event. The first photos of the new warship appeared on a display at a North Korean military exhibition in November. KCNA/NK Pro Before that, in September, Kim was photographed inspecting the ship and this photo was also published by state media. However, the photo was heavily cropped and there was little idea of the scale or the overall appearance of the vessel. One of the four new photos also appears to have been taken during that same visit. As for the size of the new vessel, Joseph Dempsey, Research Associate for Defence and Military Analysis at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) determines that it's 'likely a destroyer and the largest warship ever constructed in the DPRK.' According to Dempsey's previous analysis, 'the design appears to have an approximately 15-meter (50-foot) beam,' making it around one-third wider than the Amnok and Tuman class corvettes, which are the largest warships that North Korea has built for decades. The Amnok and Tuman class are both approximately 250 feet long, a typical length for a modern corvette, although the distinction between warship types — especially frigates and corvettes — is increasingly blurred. One of North Korea's Amnok class corvettes. KCNA Larger than the Amnok and Tuman class are the Najin class frigates dating from the 1970s, with a beam of around 33 feet and a length of 328 feet. Only two or three of these aging vessels are thought to still be in North Korean service. An aerial port-Nside view of a North Korean Navy Najin class corvette underway. U.S. Navy Allied Navy Dempsey suggests that the new warship is 'more than 100 meters (328 feet) long,' although it would have to be significantly longer than this to be considered a destroyer, in the modern understanding of that classification, with modern frigates already typically being longer than 328 feet. The Franco-Italian FREMM frigate is 465 feet long, and the Chinese Type 054 frigate is 440 feet long, for example. Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the new warship design is the apparent provision for some kind of vertical launch system (VLS), the presence of which is suggested by a large space immediately forward of the bridge. While there isn't a VLS has been installed so far, this would make sense considering the design and would reflect the weapons configurations on many other modern surface combatants. A view of the area forward of the bow reveals an aperture that may well be intended to accommodate a VLS. KCNA Provided that the new warship is intended to have a VLS, there are a variety of different kinds of missile that might be considered as payloads. These would include naval versions of surface-to-air missiles, as well as possibly anti-ship missiles, but North Korea is also increasingly focusing on the development of land attack cruise missiles — including some which are claimed to be nuclear-armed. More importantly, should a VLS is fitted, it would therefore provide the warship with much more magazine depth than previous North Korean warships, with the ability to field multiple types of weapons in a single launcher. An Amnok class corvette fires a cruise missiles. Reportedly, these missiles can be fitted with nuclear warheads. KCNA Notably, North Korea has also previously said it had plans for 'constantly deploying a ship loaded with new-type anti-aircraft missiles.' That might also be a reference to the new warship, and its potential VLS capability. The statement was an explicit threat to U.S. reconnaissance aircraft operating off the North Korean coast. While North Korea is currently busy with a wide range of military developments — with its missile programs gaining the most attention for its rapid advances — Kim has, in recent months, made statements focused on the maritime domain especially. Earlier this year, state media quoted Kim as saying that increasing the power of its naval forces is 'the most important issue in reliably defending the maritime sovereignty of the country and stepping up the war preparations at present.' He also called for '​​pushing ahead with the planned building of ships and unconditionally completing them within the period of the Five-Year Plan.' Kim observes a missile firing drill from aboard a North Korean patrol boat. KCNA Although not explicitly named as such, it seems likely that the new vessel is part of this warship-building program and it certainly fits within aspirations to develop naval capabilities, although it's unclear how many of the hulls might be planned. Should the first of the new vessels be completed 'within the period of the Five-Year Plan,' this would imply that it would be finished by January 2026. Based on the progress made so far, that would seem feasible, although it remains to be seen exactly what kinds of weapons and sensors might be installed and there would still be a period of testing and working up before the warship is actually commissioned into service. Another view of an Amnok class corvette. KCNA There has already been speculation that the new warship might end up going to sea with a phased-array radar, due to the large apertures on the sides of the superstructure that would accommodate the antennas for such a system. A combination of VLS and phased-array radar would strongly suggest the warship is intended to serve in an air-defense-optimized role, filling a long-standing gap in the fleet for an anti-air picket ship. Apertures cut into the forward part of the superstructure are inline with the typical locations of phased-array radar antennas. KCNA With the previous Amnok and Tuman class, a handful of vessels have been completed in shipyards on the east and west coasts, and it's possible that the new design might superseded these less-capable designs in the same yards. As well as the new vessel, North Korea is meanwhile working on other surface combatants, including smaller anti-submarine warfare vessels and missile boats, and some more innovative designs like the Nalchi class very slender vessel (VSV) with a wave-piercing hull. In addition, North Korea is also developing underwater capabilities, although with mixed successes so far. However, there has been recent evidence that Pyongyang might be developing its first nuclear-powered submarine design, which also underscores its significant naval ambitions. You can read more about that here. A satellite image of the Pongdae Submarine Factory on the northeast coast of North Korea, the center of its submarine development activities. Google Earth For now, while the size of North Korea's latest warship design is impressive and while it certainly has the potential to carry a comprehensive range of armament and sensors, major questions remain about Pyongyang's abilities to field higher-end naval military technologies in a fully applicable, integrated form. Even if North Korea is able to introduce a new warship with a usable radar system and a VLS array able to launch multiple types of missiles, it still remains to be seen whether the country has the shipbuilding capacity to build a more meaningful number of these warships.

Russian Fighter Jets Still At Syrian Base, Top Rebel Leader Pushe...	Al Jazeera has released a new video that it says shows Russian combat jets still at Khmeimim Air Base in Syria despite ongoing withdrawals. The fate of Russia's presence at Khmeimim, as well as its Tartus naval base, remains a hot topic of interest globally three weeks after the fall of long-time Syrian dictator and ally of Moscow Bashar Al Assad. Just this weekend, the head of the rebel coalition that ousted Assad pushed back on calls for a complete disengagement with the Kremlin, including when it comes to military affairs. Al Jazeera released the new footage of Khmeimim (also written Hmeimim), taken using a drone and seen below, earlier today, but did not say when it was shot. A machine translation of the accompanying Arab text says 'exclusive footage from Al Jazeera shows a large presence of warplanes inside the Russian Hmeimim base.' TWZ was not able to directly align what is seen in the clips with available satellite taken of the base recently. Other similar but distinctly different footage of Khmeimim captured using a drone had emerged back on December 12. مشاهد خاصة للجزيرة تظهر تواجد كبير لطائرات حربية داخل قاعدة حميميم الروسية#فيديو pic.twitter.com/uECy9iUndG&mdash; الجزيرة سوريا (@AJA_Syria) December 30, 2024 The footage from Al Jazeera does show three Flanker-series fighters and a swing-wing Su-24 Fencer combat jet under protected shelters at the northeastern end of the base are clearly seen at one point. Another view shows what looks to be four more Flankers and/or Su-34 Fullbacks (which both have prominent 'stingers' that extend from their tail ends), as well as six additional Fencers. The video from Al Jazeera also shows additional aircraft and other activity at Khmeimim, including two Russian Il-76 Candid cargo planes and another one belonging to Syrian Airlines, on an open apron at the northwestern end of the facility. The Syrian Airlines Il-76 may be one that went missing in the final chaotic moments before Assad's fall, as you can read more about here. Smaller An-26 Curl and An-72 Coaler cargo aircraft, as well as an An-30 Clank, are visible elswhere at Khmeimim in the latest footage from Al Jazeera. The An-30 is ostensibly an aerial survey aircraft, but can also be used as a transport. The video prominently shows ground-based radars still in operation at the base, as well. At least one of the radars looks to be a variant of the P-18, which can be used for air traffic control and general air surveillance. At the same time, even in the drone footage Al Jazeera has now put out, there are signs that Russia is continuing to withdraw from Khmeimim. The video shows smoke billowing from an area just off to the side of the open apron where the Il-76s are parked, which could be from the burning of materiel. Destroying certain assets in place using fire and other means is commonly seen when military forces depart overseas facilities, especially if they have to do so on relatively short notice following major upheaval in a country.

Russia's military had already removed air defenses, including an S-400 surface-to-air missile system, and other materiel from Khmeimim. Russian forces that had been deployed elsewhere in Syria have also been congregating in recent weeks at the base, which is now under the watchful eye of rebel forces.

The Russian cargo ship Ursa Major, which may have been headed for Tartus, notably sank in the Mediterranean last week after reportedly suffering an explosion in its engine room.

The facilities offer the Kremlin highly strategic and unique air and naval power projection nodes for operations in the Mediterranean and Africa. Russia's intervention in Syria beginning in 2015 was instrumental in keeping Assad in power and, by extension, retaining access to these important facilities. The regime in Damascus rewarded Moscow by essentially gifting it the bases through a 49-year 'lease' deal in 2017. There are reports that Russia could be redeploying forces from Syria to bases in Libya and elsewhere in Africa. A view of a gate to Khmeimim Air Base on December 29, 2024. The Russian soldier, at right, is said to be inspecting a petition from a Syrian man from Aleppo who was a former resident of Russia, asking to repatriate his daughter back to Syria. AAREF WATAD/AFP via Getty Images AAREF WATAD Russia's relationship with Assad and its active operations against the same rebels now seeking to form a new Syrian government have raised obvious questions about the future of its bases in the country. Combat jets at Khmeimim were still flying strikes against rebel forces right up until the collapse of the former regime. However, 'we don't want Russia to exit Syria in a way that undermines its relationship with our country,' Ahmad Al Sharaa said in an interview with Saudi Arabian state-owned news outlet Al Arabiya this weekend. 'We do not want Russia to leave Syria in the way that some wish.' Al Sharaa, still better known by his nom de guerre Abu Mohammad Al Jolani (and other simply just as Jolani), is head of Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which led the rebel coalition that deposed Assad. 'All of Syria's arms are of Russian origin, and many power plants are managed by Russian experts,' Al Sharaa further told Al Arabiya, while also highlighting the 'deep strategic interests' of what he described as the 'second most powerful country in the world.' Ahmad Al Sharaa addresses a crowd at Umayyad Mosque in Damascus in the immediate aftermath of the fall of Assad's regime on December 8, 2024. Aref TAMMAWI/AFP via Getty Images In his interview with Al Arabiya, Al Sharaa also said that 'Syria cannot continue without relations with an important regional country like Iran,' but stressed that relations 'must be based on respect for the sovereignty of both countries and noninterference in the affairs of both countries.' The HTS leader has been particularly vocal in his criticism of the regime in Tehran, another one of Assad's major foreign benefactors, and how it wields its regional influence. Since the fall of Assad, Al Sharaa has been very actively working broadly to present the new government HTS is working to form as a pragmatic and moderate entity. HTS is an evolution of an Al Qaeda franchise in Syria, but claimed to have broken ties with the international terrorist organization in 2016. HTS itself remains a designated terrorist group in Russia, as well as the United States and many other countries. The U.S. government is reportedly set to withdraw a $10 million bounty on Al Sharaa personally following a visit to the country by an American delegation earlier this month. As the fledging government in Damascus works to move Syria beyond its pariah status under Assad, it is also facing pressure to realign itself, particularly away from Russia. Ukraine has notably been positioning itself as an alternative partner for the new Syrian government. Ukrainian operatives had reportedly worked with Syrian rebel groups, particularly when it came to providing assistance in expanding their kamikaze drone capabilities, in the lead-up to the fall of Assad. 'We believe that from a strategic point of view, the removal of Russia’s presence in Syria will contribute to the stability of not only the Syrian state but the entire Middle East and Africa,' Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha‎ said in a statement around an official visit to Damascus just today where he met with Al Sharaa and others. 'The Russian and Assad regimes supported each other because they were based on violence and torture.' Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha‎, at left, meets with Ahmad Al Sharaa, at right, in Damascus, on December 30, 2024. Ali Haj Suleiman/Getty Images For their part, Russian authorities have persistently claimed that no final decision has been reached on Khmeimim and Tartus, despite reports that they could be on the verge of being forced out of Syria. HTS-led authorities in Damascus still face broad challenges in establishing a functional nationwide government in a country where various other domestic and international actors continue to hold significant sway. Fighting between Turkish-supported and U.S.-backed forces in the northeastern end of the country has spiked since the fall of Assad. Israel is also now occupying a portion of southern Syria, ostensibly as a buffer zone amid the ongoing geopolitical uncertainty. Israeli and American forces have also taken advantage of the newly permissive airspace over Syria, especially the once heavily guarded western end of the country, to launch major airstrikes in recent weeks targeting former regime military assets and ISIS terrorists, respectively. For the moment, at least, Russia does continue to maintain a military presence in Syria, including combat jets still at Khmeimim, despite the continued signs of withdrawal.

U.S. Army’s First Combat Use Of THAAD Missile Defense System Just...	One of America’s prized Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) batteries fired an interceptor in combat for the first time Thursday. The system, forward-deployed in Israel, was employed against an incoming medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) fired by the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, a U.S. military official told TWZ. The official added that it was unclear as of Friday if the U.S. interceptor or an Israeli one actually took out the missile. A THAAD battery belonging to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) scored the system's first kill overall in 2022, as you can read more about here. Video appeared online purportedly showing the U.S. THAAD interceptor's launch in Israel earlier today. A voice was heard saying he had waited '18 years waiting for this,' a potential reference to the system's age, as the U.S. Army stood up its first THAAD battery in 2008, after it was developed beginning in the early 1990s. מערכת ה- THAAD האמריקנית לקחה חלק ביירוט הטיל הבליסטי ששוגר אמש מתימן. אפשר לשמוע את אחד החיילים האמריקניים מתרגש '18 שנים חיכיתי לזה' pic.twitter.com/s4VoMfMhaF&mdash; איתי בלומנטל Itay Blumental (@ItayBlumental) December 27, 2024 The THAAD battery and about 100 soldiers were deployed to Israel in October to bolster Israel’s defenses ahead of an expected Israeli retaliation for Tehran’s massive missile barrage earlier that month. A counter-attack from Iran never came to fruition, but the battery has stayed in place. Houthi rebels have launched sporadic missile barrages at Israel for months, including while Israel was conducting airstrikes on multiple targets in Yemen during the early hours of Dec. 19. A supporter of Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels fields a diorama of a U.S. warship under a Houthi missile during a demonstration in the capital Sanaa on Dec. 6, 2024. (Mohammed Hamoud/Getty Images) On Friday, the Yemeni rebel group said it had launched a missile at Israel’s Ben Gurion Airport and also targeted Tel Aviv with a drone attack, all in retaliation for recent Israeli strikes on Sanaa International Airport, the Guardian reported. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the ballistic missile was intercepted before it reached Israeli airspace. Still, residents in central Israel were ordered into shelters for fear of falling debris, the publication noted, adding that there were no reports in Israel of hostile drones over Tel Aviv. The exact configuration of the THAAD battery currently in Israel is unclear, but a unit of this kind can include up to nine transporter-erector-launchers, each carrying eight interceptors, as well as a long-range AN/TPY-2 X-band radar, a mobile fire control and command and control center, and various supporting equipment. Additional interceptors would be available to reload the launchers during a combat deployment, as well. It is a terminal missile defense system, meaning it takes out short-, medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles in the final stages of flight, as they careen down through the atmosphere at their final targeted destinations. A briefing slide showing the general composition of Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) batteries as of 2016. (U.S. Defense Department) For Israel, the THAAD sits at the top end of air defense systems in the country capable of terminal phase missile defense, which also includes David's Sling and the Arrow 2 system. Israel recently retired its Patriot surface-to-air missile batteries, which had terminal missile defense capabilities. The land-based terminal phase intercept capability can be augmented by positioning U.S. Aegis-equipped surface combatants loaded with SM-6 missiles off the Israeli coast. Israel also has a robust mid-course intercept capability in the form of the Arrow 3 system and the same U.S. Navy ships loaded with SM-3s can also provide this capability. The U.S. Army’s seven THAAD batteries have seen multiple short and long-standing deployments in the past. In addition to the one presently in Israel, two more of the units are currently forward-deployed, one in Guam and one in South Korea. While Thursday’s intercept was the first time the U.S. Army had fired the system to defeat an incoming threat, as we noted earlier, the UAE used its THAAD system to bring down a Houthi ballistic missile that was targeting an oil facility near Al Dhafra Air Base, which was hosting U.S. and French forces in addition to Emirati personnel when the attack took place in January 2022. Go here to read TWZ's past reporting on that intercept. A Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) array fires. www.twz.com The deployment this past October was not the first time a THAAD had been sent to Israel, either. The U.S. Army sent the system there in 2019 for an exercise, part of a Pentagon effort to test quickly deploying capabilities, while keeping adversaries from having too much foreknowledge about U.S. military plans, TWZ reported at the time. The U.S. Army has maintained a long-range AN/TPY-2 X-band radar at Site 512, a so-called 'cooperative security location' in Israel’s Negev Desert, since 2012, to bolster Israeli and U.S. missile defenses. The service also started manning a location known as Site 883 in 2017 at Israel’s Bislach Air Base, also in the Negev, seemingly to help streamline the flow of critical data from Site 512, another sign of America’s burgeoning air and missile defense capability in Israel before the current conflict erupted. While Thursday’s intercept marks a THAAD milestone for the U.S. Army, it once again highlights strains in the service’s air defense systems and the soldiers who man them, finite capabilities that are increasingly deployed around the world. TWZ investigated the issue in-depth in 2023, and you can read that coverage here. Demand within the U.S. military for advanced air defense systems, including THAAD, and the interceptors that go with them, has only increased since then. Obligations in the Middle East, including to help defend Israel, as well as in Europe, particularly to Ukraine, have been important driving factors. Growing concerns about Chinese military threats in the Pacific have also prompted new air and missile defense needs. Army Secretary Christine Wormuth acknowledged the stressors being placed on air defense batteries at the time of the THAAD deployment to Israel. Wormuth noted that 'the air defense artillery community is the most stressed,' and said that such units have the highest operational tempo. To mitigate that, Wormuth said the service was trying to modernize its integrated and missile defenses to create more capacity. That in part involves integrating the Patriot battery’s new Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS) into the Army’s Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS) network. Wormuth said that integration would 'greatly increase the capacity of the existing Patriot force that we have, and that will help reduce some of the stress on our soldiers.' Test firing a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) interceptor. (U.S. Army) TWZ has previously broken down what LTAMDS brings to the table: 'LTAMDS is designed to provide higher-fidelity sensing capability at much further distances and process a wider array of data more quickly than the Patriot’s current radar. It can also offer 360-degree coverage, which the current system cannot. The IBCS connects various sensors to effectors like, gun systems, lasers, missile systems, and electronic warfare capabilities and combines all this data on the entire air defense situation into a single actionable ‘picture’ for operators. The combination is meant to give air defenders a much greater ability to better react to and if necessary shoot down a multitude of threats at once.' Still, while this force multiplying new technology will certainly help, physically more missile batteries are also a critical part of the solution, but just how much investment will be poured into doing so remains to be seen. Other Army lines of effort involve being 'as choosy as we can about what we take on,' so as to minimize stress on the force, Wormuth said.

Russian-Linked Oil Tanker Suspected Of Sabotage Was Brimming With...	The Eagle S - a tanker ship carrying Russian oil and suspected of severing the Estlink 2 power cable running under the Baltic Sea between Finland and Estonia - was reportedly brimming with spy equipment. The cable incident is the latest in a series of such events in this strategically important region as tensions with Russia have mounted in the wake of its war on Ukraine. After being seized by Finnish Police, the Eagle S was found to be 'kitted out with special transmitting and receiving devices that were used to monitor naval activity, according to a source with direct involvement in the ship,' Lloyds List reported. That equipment 'effectively allowed it to become a 'spy ship' for Russia.' Russia-linked cable-cutting tanker seized by Finland ‘was loaded with spying equipment’ Michael Weiss (@michaeldweiss) December 27, 2024 'The hi-tech equipment on board was abnormal for a merchant ship and consumed more power from the ship’s generator, leading to repeated blackouts, a source familiar with the vessel who provided commercial maritime services to it as recently as seven months ago,' the publication noted. The 'listening and recording equipment was brought on to the 20-year-old tanker via 'huge portable suitcases' along with 'many laptops' that had keyboards for Turkish and Russian languages when calling at Türkiye and Russia,' Lloyd's List reported. 'The equipment was kept on the bridge or in the 'monkey island,' the uppermost portion of the ship.' 'The transmitting and receiving devices were used to record all radio frequencies, and upon reaching Russia were offloaded for analysis,' the outlet added. 'They were monitoring all NATO naval ships and aircraft. They had all details on them. They were just matching their frequencies.' The equipment was being operated by 'Russians, Turkish, Indian radio officers,' Lloyds List stated. 'Eagle S also dropped 'sensors-type devices' in the English Channel during a transit,' the publication's sources claimed. The War Zone cannot independently verify these claims, however, a shipping industry security source told us that they 'are plausible.' After the Eagle S was seen in the location within the Finnish Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) where the Estlink 2 cable was severed, the Finnish police, in cooperation with other authorities, boarded and seized the 750-foot-long, Cook Island-flagged oil tanker and took it into their territorial waters. Finnish authorities also launched a criminal investigation.

'The authorities have taken investigative measures on the vessel, with access there provided by the Finnish Border Guard and the Defence Forces helicopters. The police are also looking into other possible damages in the maritime area.' Finnish investigators believe Eagle S may have caused the damage by dragging its anchor along the seabed, Reuters reported. United Arab Emirates-based Caravella LLCFZ, which owns the vessel according to MarineTraffic data, did not respond to our request for comment. The 658 megawatt (MW) Estlink 2 outage began at midday local time on Wednesday, leaving only the 358 MW Estlink 1 linking Finland and Estonia, the countries' electricity grid operators told Reuters. The following day, officials said that four telecommunications cables connecting Estonia with Finland under the Baltic Sea were also out of service.

After Estonia experienced power outages following the severing of Estlink 2 on Dec. 25, its officials, along with those from Finland, asked NATO for help protecting the Estlink 1 undersea power cable about 25 miles to the west. On Friday, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte responded by saying the alliance will 'enhance' its presence in the Baltic Sea without offering any details. When asked for specifics by The War Zone, a NATO spokesman declined to 'provide operational details at this time.'

'The Estonian Navy is commencing the protection of the Estlink 1 sea cable with the patrol ship Raju, cooperating with the Finnish Navy and the Supreme Allied Commander Europe of NATO (SACEUR) to secure energy connections between Estonia and Finland,' the Estonian Navy said on Twitter.

Cavoli, the SACUER, told us he is considering a 'serious' response that could involve U.S. assets. 'The Supreme Allied Commander Europe has followed this closely since the beginning,' SACUER spokesman Martin O’Donnell told The War Zone. 'The possible sabotage of undersea cables is a serious matter, and it requires an equally serious and thoughtful response.' Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) 'has options and assets from 32 countries, including the U.S., available to respond,' he added. 'SHAPE, in close coordination with Allied Joint Force Command Brunssum, Allied Maritime Command, and the involved nations are coordinating employment of those options and assets, but I am not in a position to provide further operational details at this time.' A spokesman for the Finnish military declined comment, deferring questions to the Finnish police, who are leading the investigation into the cable rupture. The suspected sabotage of the Estlink 2 power cable is the most recent of several such incidents. In November, Germany said damage to two communication cables running under the Baltic Sea was most likely the result of sabotage. The two cables in question are both fiber-optic communication cables, running along the Baltic seabed. One of these runs between the Swedish island of Gotland and Lithuania, and the other between Finland and Germany. Gotland is about 280 miles southwest of where the Estlink 2 cable was severed. A day later, Denmark confirmed it was monitoring a Chinese cargo vessel at the center of allegations surrounding that damage. The 735-foot-long Yi Peng 3 was identified as operating near the cables when the incidents occurred. The Chinese vessel had departed the Russian port of Ust-Luga, in the Leningrad region, close to the Estonian border, on Nov. 15 and had been scheduled to sail to Port Said, Egypt, where it was originally due to arrive on Dec. 3. Based on publicly available ship-tracking data, the Yi Peng 3 appears to have passed overhead both of the cables around the same time incidents of damage were first reported.

'No one believes that the cables were accidentally damaged,' German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said at the time. 'I also don’t want to believe that the ships’ anchors caused the damage by accident. We have to assume, without certain information, that the damage is caused by sabotage.' Two undersea communication cables, one linking Finland to continental Europe via Germany and another linking Lithuania and Sweden's Gotland Island were damaged last month. (Photo by Murat Usubali/Anadolu via Getty Images) Anadolu Other suspicious activities have taken place in the Baltic Sea, including suspected sabotage. Most notoriously, there was a series of explosions along the Nord Stream gas pipelines in 2022. The cause of these is still being investigated by German authorities however The Wall Street Journal reported in August that it was a Ukrainian sabotage operation. Ukrainian officials denied that accusation. Outside of the Baltic, there have been other incidents of reported sabotage of critical communications cables, including one associated with Evenes Air Station, in northern Norway, which happened in April, but was only disclosed in August, as TWZ reported at the time. Norway has seen other suspicious incidents in the past, notably the cutting of a vital undersea cable connecting Svalbard to mainland Norway in 2022. While the Baltic Sea has long been of strategic significance for both Russia and NATO and its allies, there has been a spike in incidents in these waters since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Though no blame has yet been officially assigned for the Estlink 2 cable cut, the fact that a Russian-connected ship packed with surveillance equipment is suspected only adds to the regional tension.

China’s New Domestically Developed Y-20 Airborne Early Warning Je...	Pictures have emerged of what looks to be the first known example of a new Chinese airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft based on the four-engine Y-20 cargo plane. China already has a remarkably large fleet of AEW&C platforms, but most of them are smaller turboprop designs, as TWZ has previously explored in detail. A modern, large, jet-powered type that is based on a locally produced aircraft could succeed or at least augment the small number of existing jet-powered KJ-2000 Mainrings based on the Russian Il-76 Candid airframe. The Y-20 AEW&C aircraft's appearance comes among a number of major Chinese military reveals in the past two days, including the emergence of two previously unseen Chinese advanced combat jets, as well as the official launch of the PLAN's first monster Type 076 amphibious assault ship. pic.twitter.com/kww8ewKZhQ&mdash; OedoSoldier (@OedoSoldier) December 27, 2024 There have been reports for years now that a Y-20-based AEW&C plane, often referred to colloquially as the KJ-3000, has been in the works. The current expectation is that such an aircraft would be based on the up-engined Y-20B variant that first emerged in 2020. Developed by the state-run Xi’an Aircraft Company (XAC), the baseline Y-20A cargo jet first flew in 2013. An aerial refueling tanker variant of the Y-20, known variously as the Y-20U and YY-20B, is also now in service. A picture of an up-engined Y-20B. Chinese Internet A baseline Y-20A. Taiwan Ministry of National Defense The pictures of the apparent KJ-3000 that began circulating online yesterday, offering a limited view of its configuration. It does have a large circular radome on top of the rear end of the fuselage as is commonly seen on many AEW&C aircraft, including the existing Chinese KJ-2000, as well as the Russian A-50 Mainstay (also based on the Il-76) and U.S. E-3 Sentry.

USAF From what is visible now, the new Y-20-based design may have additional large domes on top of the forward fuselage and underneath the tail. The KJ-2000 and the A-50 both have additional domes on top of and below the forward fuselage linked to their extensive communications suites, another critical component of any AEW&C aircraft. The KJ-3000 could have other intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities beyond just its radar, as well. Ok, it goes on and on and on: second surprise this morning, the new KJ-3000 (?) AEW performed its maiden flight at XAC and from what can be seen on the first few small & blurry images, it is as expected a Y-20B-based design featuring a large rotodome but also a bulge on the tail. pic.twitter.com/MTp9A6dfDh&mdash; @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) December 27, 2024 It notably remains to be seen how exactly the KJ-3000's main radome might be configured. Unlike the rotating main radomes on the A-50 and the E-3, the ones on top of China's existing KJ-2000s, as well as its turboprop KJ-500s, are fixed and use three separate active electronically scanned array (AESA) antennas to provide 360-degree coverage. Whatever radar and other mission systems the KJ-3000 might have, for China, just having new AEW&C aircraft leveraging a larger jet-powered airframe would be beneficial. There are only four operational KJ-2000s and it was something of a saga to acquire them in the first place, as you can read more about here. The People's Liberation Army Air Force and Navy (PLAAF and PLAN) have fielded a large number of increasingly capable domestically-developed turboprop AEW&Cs over the years, as you can learn more about in this past TWZ feature. However, a Y-20-based type would offer advantages in terms of speed, range, and on-station time. It would also be able to fly at higher altitudes to provide a better perch for its radar. This is very important, especially for providing ‘look down’ capability to spot and track low-flying aircraft and missiles that radars down below might not be able to 'see' due to terrain and other factors In addition, the KJ-3000's larger crew would be better able to handle longer endurance and more complex missions. If the Chinese were to add aerial refueling capability to the aircraft it would further extend its reach and total mission time. Versions of the turboprop KJ-200 and KJ-500 AEW&C aircraft with aerial refueling probes have been developed. A KJ-500A with an aerial refueling probe. Chinese Internet As a completely locally developed platform, the KJ-3000 would be easier to maintain and sustain, as well as upgrade, compared to the KJ-2000s. The Mainrings are understood to be expensive to operate and are tied to supply chains in Russia. A Y-20-based design could even open a possible path to the export market. China does offer turboprop AEW&C aircraft for sale on the open market and has sold examples to Pakistan. AEW&C aircraft, in general, are important elements of any modern air force. This is especially the case for the PLA, which continues to expand the size and scope of its tactical and strategic aviation fleets. Aircraft like the KJ-3000 help Chinese forces extend and support anti-access and area denial bubbles, including around the mainland, Taiwan, and the hotly contested South China Sea, as well as project power further afield. As TWZ has written in the past: 'The proliferation of Chinese AEW&C aircraft, in particular, points to changing visions of future warfare, including not only defending the People’s Republic but also increasingly projecting power over greater distances, and in a wider variety of regions, including the highly strategic South China Sea. The Chinese military clearly values its AEW&C capability highly, providing them not only with airspace surveillance including a vital look-down capability, but also monitoring the sea, to a lesser degree.' &#8230; 'Having such a large and expanding fleet of AEW&C platforms and their particular characteristics also point to how these aircraft might actually be used in a potential future conflict, perhaps one involving the U.S. military. With this kind of capacity, China should be able to not only cover the approaches to their most strategic areas but also operate from more dispersed and even austere bases. Smaller types, in particular, like the turboprop-powered KJ-200 and KJ-500 series are especially well suited to these kinds of operations and are regular features at China’s island outposts, as well as operating routinely in the highly strategic Taiwan Strait.' 'Production and deliveries of the KJ-500 – the PRC’s [People's Republic of China] most advanced airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft – continued at a rapid pace, joining earlier KJ-2000 Mainring and KJ-200 Moth variants,' according to the Pentagon's most recent annual report on Chinese military developments, which it released earlier this month. 'These aircraft amplify the PLAAF’s ability to detect, track, and target threats in varying conditions, in larger volumes, and at greater distances. It extends the range of the PLA’s IADS [integrated air defense system] network.' A Chinese KJ-200, which has a 'balance beam' style radar array on top of its fuselage rather than a type inside a circular radome. Alert5 via Wikicommons (Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International license) U.S. military officials have also highlighted the significance of Chinese AEW&C developments in the past, especially for controlling more and more capable combat jets armed with ever-longer-ranged air-to-air missiles. 'We notice that they are flying it [the J-20 stealth fighter] pretty well,' Gen. Kenneth Wilsbach, then head of Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), said in 2022. 'We recently had – I wouldn’t call it an engagement – where we got relatively close to the J-20s along with our F-35s in the East China Sea, and we’re relatively impressed with the command and control that was associated with the J-20.' 'Some of their very long-range air-to-air missiles are aided by that KJ-500,' Wilsbach, who is now head of Air Combat Command, added at that time. More certainly remains to be learned about the KJ-3000, but it is a logical addition to the PLA's existing AEW&C fleets that looks set to provide valuable additional capabilities.

China’s Monster Type 076 Amphibious Assault Ship Seen Like Never ...	China has held a launch ceremony for its first super-sized Type 076 amphibious assault ship, now named Sichuan, though the vessel does not look to have gone into the water yet. Imagery from the event does offer the best look at the ship to date, including its twin island configuration, its wide flight deck with a single electromagnetic catapult, its well deck, and its extensive array of close-in defenses. The ceremony at Hudong-Zhonghua Shipyard notably comes just a day after two different previously unseen Chinese advanced combat jet designs broke cover. The ceremony took place today, Friday, December 27, at a dry dock at Hudong-Zhonghua Shipyard on Changxing Island in Shanghai where Sichuan has been under construction since at least October 2023. Hudong-Zhonghua is a subsidiary of the state-owned China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC). 一切为了攻击！ pic.twitter.com/ToEeSJPc0y&mdash; DS北风（风哥） (@WenJian0922) December 27, 2024 祝贺大四川喜提076 pic.twitter.com/jP0BifBKd0&mdash; DS北风（风哥） (@WenJian0922) December 27, 2024 China Type 076 LHD Launch Footage on spot • PLA Navy pic.twitter.com/bLL9HrZOE1&mdash; David Wang (@Nickatgreat1220) December 27, 2024 Official pictures and satellite images from Planet Labs that TWZ reviewed show that the dry dock where the Type 076 is situated, and which it also shares with two other warships under construction, is not flooded. When it might actually enter the water for the first time is unclear. The ceremony is still a significant event and Sichuan, also now known by its hull number 51, certainly looks ready for a true launch. As TWZ has explored in detail in the past, the Type 076 is really unlike any other amphibious assault ship in service or under construction anywhere else in the world at present. A look at the Type 076 during the launch ceremony. Chinese Internet An official statement from the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) says Sichuan will displace around 40,000 tons with a full combat load. Previous analysis by TWZ puts the ship's length at around 864 feet and its width at some 141 feet wide (or 263 and nearly 43 meters, respectively). This all makes the Type 076 substantially larger than China's existing Type 075 amphibious assault ship. The design is also notably wider than other big deck amphibious warfare ships in service globally, such as the U.S. Navy's America class. Official announcement from the Chinese PLA Navy: full displacement of over 40,000 tons, twin island superstructures, electromagnetic catapult and arresting gear for fixed-wing aircraft. pic.twitter.com/5MVQW6bNCA&mdash; Ryan Chan 陳家翹 (@ryankakiuchan) December 27, 2024 The PLAN has also now officially stated the Type 076 features a single electromagnetic catapult at the bow, as well as arresting gar towards the stern, for the launch and recovery of fixed-wing aircraft. There is considerable evidence that drones, including stealthy uncrewed combat air vehicles (UCAV), will make up a substantial part of Sichuan's air wing. Earlier this year, apparent mockups of the GJ-11 Sharp Sword UCAV, or variants or derivatives thereof, appeared at a test and/or training site right on Changxing Island near where the Type 076 has been being built. A pair of apparent GJ-11 mockups at a test and/or training site on Changxing Island in Shanghai in May 2024. Google Earth There remain no indications, at least publicly, that China is pursuing crewed short or vertical takeoff and landing capable tactical jets that would be well suited for operations from a ship like the Type 076. Other lighter crewed types could potentially operate from Sichuan in addition to drones. Helicopters, crewed and uncrewed, will primarily make use of the design's ample deck space, as well. The event today also offers a better view of Sichuan's twin island configuration, another feature optimized for aviation operations. Having two distinct islands allows for one to be dedicated to navigation and other ship operations-related tasks, while the other is focused on flight operations. A drone-heavy air wing presents additional demands when it comes to managing aircraft on the flight deck and in the air, which only increases the value of having a physical structure centered purely on aviation activities. A look at Sichuan's two islands during today's ceremony. Chinese Internet Britain's Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers notably have a twin island arrangement for the same general reasons. India’s future aircraft carrier Vishal may have a similar configuration. Italy's Trieste amphibious warfare ship, a closer analog to the Type 076, also has two islands.

Crown Copyright The Royal Navy's new aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth will arrive in Gibraltar today for her first overseas port visit. Image by Dave Jenkins via Wikimedia Commons, CC-BY-2.0 However, the imagery from the ceremony also confirms that the Type 076 has a rear well deck for launching and recovering landing craft. It had been unclear whether or not the design would be aviation-centric like the first two examples of the U.S. America class and omit this feature. A view of Sichuan's stern showing the top of the door covering the ship's well deck. Chinese Internet In addition, the new views of Sichuan highlight the ship's substantial close-in defense capabilities, including at least three HQ-10 surface-to-air missile launchers (two at the stern and on one top of the forward island), at least three Type 1130 close-in weapon systems (two on each side of the hull and one at the stern), and what looks to be four 32-tube defensive launchers (two on each side of the hull). The HQ-10 is a rough analog to the launchers for the RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) found on U.S. Navy and other western warships, and is designed to provide the same close-in protection against incoming cruise missiles and other aerial threats, as well as potentially some small surface ones. The Type 1130 is a gun-based system designed to provide another layer of close-in defense with its 30mm Gatling-type cannon. Defensive launchers on Chinese warships can reportedly be loaded with decoy flares, cartridges full of radar-scattering chaff, and active decoys equipped with small radiofrequency jammers, which can be used to confuse seekers on enemy missiles, as well rockets with small depth charges to engage submarines and combat divers. A view of the port stern corner of the Type 076 showing examples of, from left to right, a 32-tube defensive launcher, an HQ-10 surface-to-air missile launcher, and a Type 1130 close-in weapon system. Chinese Internet This is a significant array of active defenses compared to what is found on many big-deck amphibious assault ships and even some light aircraft carriers. The Type 076's defensive capabilities might also be further bolstered by electronic warfare and electronic support measure systems. Overall, the Type 076 represents a significant new naval capability for the PLAN. As TWZ has written previously: 'The potential value to the PLAN of having a fleet of very large deck amphibious assault ships that are highly capable of large-scale drone operations as well as traditional amphibious assaults is clear. These ships could be used to launch and recover UCAVs like the GJ-11 and other types of drones to perform a host of missions from maritime strike to intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). They could be used to provide additional ‘mass’ in support of the operations of larger carrier strike groups and help to free the air wings of flattops like Fujian up for tasks they might be better suited for. In addition, they could provide a lower tier of naval aviation support that could be employed independently.' &#8230; 'Simply having more naval aviation capacity overall would give the PLAN added flexibility for various operations closer to the mainland, including a potential military intervention against Taiwan or defending its expansive and largely unrecognized territorial claims in places like the South China Sea. Type 076s could also help project naval and air power further from China’s shores, something that has also been a driving factor behind the country’s broader carrier ambitions.' &#8230; 'The Type 076 could help provide support during humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations. Big deck amphibious warfare ships, in general, provide their operators with immensely valuable platforms for projecting both hard and soft power.' Chinese Internet The Pentagon's most recent annual report on Chinese military developments, which it released earlier this month, underscores these assessments. The 'ship will likely use a hybrid electric propulsion system and have electromagnetic catapults (EMALS) for launching large maritime UAVs [uncrewed aerial vehicles] for strike and ISR missions' and will be able to 'provide additional sea control via catapult-launched UAVs,' the report says at various points. The Type 076 further reflects China's substantial shipbuilding capacity and the speed with which it is increasingly capable of producing very large warships. Sichuan underscores broader efforts by China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) to modernize and otherwise expand its capabilities across all domains, as well. Altogether, while the Type 076 still does not look to have been truly launched just yet, that milestone looks increasingly imminent and significant progress clearly continues to be made toward actually delivering the ship to the PLAN.

Yes, China Just Flew Another Tailless Next-Generation Stealth Com...	It appears that another new Chinese combat aircraft has already entered flight testing, and it is also an advanced, stealthy, tailless design. The imagery of the previously unseen aircraft began to circulate on social media today, only a matter of hours after the first appearance of a remarkable diamond-shaped, tailless, heavy tactical combat aircraft design which you can read more about in our initial analysis piece here. A video and several photos of the second, apparently smaller aircraft began to emerge today and, so far at least, they are fewer in number and of inferior quality, making it harder to determine particular details. pic.twitter.com/BKHGVbRIbn&mdash; OedoSoldier (@OedoSoldier) December 26, 2024 Before we continue, it’s important to note that so far this imagery looks remarkably legitimate. That is not to say that it’s verified authentic at this time. There remains the possibility it has been fabricated, but also considering the timing with the other reveal, that seems increasingly unlikely. According to unconfirmed accounts, the second combat aircraft design is from the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation (SAC), while the first, larger design is from the rival Chengdu Aircraft Corporation (CAC). While Shenyang is responsible for the production of Chinese developments of the Flanker multirole fighter family and the medium-weight J-35 stealth fighter family, Chengdu builds the J-10 multirole medium fighter and the heavy J-20 stealth fighter. The second tactical jet aircraft design was shown in some of the photos being ‘chased’ by a Flanker-series fighter, perhaps a two-seat J-16, which would lend further support to the idea that it’s a Shenyang product. A rear-aspect view of the reported Shenyang combat aircraft design. From this angle, a prominent flight-test data probe can be seen on the nose. via X via X While the Chengdu design has a modified diamond-delta wing planform, with extended wing-root ‘chines,’’ the Shenyang aircraft has a relatively sharply swept wing, although this is hardly conventional, being more in line with a ‘lambda’ wing profile. This platform creates prominent triangular-shaped trailing-edge extensions that taper back from roughly the mid-point in the wing, and which project out beyond the engine exhausts. Unlike the apparent new Chengdu design, which is understood to have a three-engine powerplant, the Shenyang design is a more conventional twin-engine aircraft, in keeping also with its smaller size. The engines appear to be fed by what seem to be diverterless supersonic inlet (DSI) intakes on either side of the forward fuselage, below the wing root, and which look to be very angular in shape. The apparent Shenyang combat aircraft design seen from below. via X Two engine nozzles are evident, with some kind of a protuberance between them. From the available angles, it’s not immediately clear if the aircraft has a cockpit. While it would make sense for it to be a part of China’s crewed combat aircraft development path, it could also be a drone or an optionally crewed aircraft. The fuselage is somewhat angular, and deep, suggesting a diamond-shaped cross-section, which would offer a blend of low observability and useful internal capacity for fuel and weapons. Two views of the apparent new Shenyang combat aircraft alongside what looks to be a J-16 chase plane. via X via X The Shenyang design also has a more standard-looking tricycle landing gear, with single wheels on each main unit, while the Chengdu design uses more robust twin-wheel bogies on the main gear to accommodate its larger size and gross weight. Neither of the two designs features any kind of vertical or horizontal tail surfaces. This is entirely in keeping with what we expected of China’s next-generation fighter designs, with tailless concepts having previously appeared in the form of various studies as well as a mysterious tailless vehicle that appeared in satellite images at Chengdu in October 2021. Tailless designs are something we have previously discussed in depth before, in relation to future Chinese fighters, but it’s worth noting that the main advantage they confer is in terms of broadband low observability against a variety of radar types operating across multiple frequencies. At the same time, the radar signature, especially from the side and rear perspectives, will also be reduced significantly. The new ‘heavy’ Chinese combat aircraft alongside a J-20S chase plane. The new design, like the J-20, is thought to be a Chengdu product. via X Two more views of the new ‘heavy’ Chinese combat aircraft, perhaps designated J-36. via X Other advantages of a tailless design include reduced aerodynamic drag, which provides improved performance for sustained high-speed dashes and cruising flight. Additional beneficial factors will almost certainly include a large internal volume for the carriage of fuel and weapons — critical for extended combat radius and persistence on-station, two key concerns in the Asia Pacific theater. At the same time, a tailless configuration can adversely affect overall stability and maneuverability, requiring advanced fly-by-wire digital flight control technology to simply keep it in the air. One feature that could help mitigate stability and maneuverability deficiencies would involve thrust-vectoring engines, something China has tested in the past. Without a good view from the rear, it’s impossible to say for certain, but the nozzles could conceivably feature F-22-style two-dimensional thrust-vectoring. Unconfirmed reports suggest that the Shenyang design is a prototype fighter and made its first flight on December 20 this year. Another view of the apparent Shenyang combat aircraft design from below. Test flights performed over populated areas suggest no great desire to hide the aircraft from prying eyes. via X However, it seems that Beijing very deliberately ensured that the two new designs broke cover today, for maximum impact. This would make sense given that December 26 is the birthdate of Mao Zedong, the founder of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). It is also exactly 13 years to the day that the J-20 first broke cover. At this point, it’s worth noting that in both cases, we cannot currently confirm the identities of the manufacturers or even the intended roles of the new aircraft. So far, there have been no official comments from the Chinese government or industry, although internal security services certainly appear to have let imagery be leaked via unofficial channels and it’s also notable that these test flights were documented in the daytime. As we have discussed before, the design now thought to be from Chengdu is notably large, suggesting that it could possibly be related to the so-called JH-XX. This is described by U.S. intelligence officials as a regional bomber, with a shorter range, smaller payload capacity, and more of tactical focus than the H-20 stealth bomber. The H-20 is being developed by the Xi’an Aircraft Corporation (XAC) and is widely expected to be a flying-wing type aircraft, like the B-2 and B-21. The JH-XX remains a very shadowy project, but you can read more about what is known here. A picture that has previously emerged showing a model of a design that might be tied to work on the JH-XX. Chinese Internet In the past, we have also suggested that the JH-XX ‘bomber’ could finally emerge as something closer to a ‘fighter-bomber’: 'The design could prioritize speed, as well as stealth, too. This could give the smaller fighter-bomber added advantages when it comes to sortie rates and for successfully penetrating through an enemy’s integrated air defense network. Above all else, it allows for multi-role operations, including supporting long-range air-to-air missions, without a heavy reliance on vulnerable tankers or even the use of coastal airfields, which would be the most vulnerable to attack during an all-out conflict.' While the new three-engine design could be related to the JH-XX, it could also be a more generic demonstrator intended to test a variety of combat aircraft technologies. It could also be a more heavyweight fighter being developed under China’s next-generation airpower initiative. Speaking to TWZ, Chinese aerospace observer and author Andreas Rupprecht explained that his assessment is that we are seeing combat aircraft demonstrators from Shenyang and Chengdu and that these are both closer aligned to fighters rather than bombers. 'Using the sixth-generation description is perhaps a little too hasty, but I think we are at the point where we can really say the Chinese have shown us for the first time their idea of air combat and new-generation fighters,' Rupprecht said. Certainly, China now appears to be flying two different very advanced combat aircraft designs, which could also be rivals, with one being smaller than its competitor, which would have certain advantages in terms of cost, complexity, and performance. They could also be intended to complement one another as a ‘medium/heavy’ future manned fighter combat mix. This latter would parallel China’s pursuit of the single-engine J-10 and the twin-engine J-11/16 series, followed by the co-development of the medium-weight J-35 and the larger J-20 stealth fighters. At one stage, it looked like the J-35 would be primarily aimed at export customers, as well as for Chinese naval use, but a Chinese land-based version is now also known to be in development.

Photo by Wang Jingtian/VCG via Getty Images A Shenyang J-35 stealth fighter. Chinese Internet Chinese Internet What we do know is that China has an active sixth-generation fighter program. It would not be surprising for more than one flying demonstrator design to be built to support it, or even prototypes much closer to planned production aircraft. Whether China plans to introduce more than one sixth-generation fighter, or simply determine what kind of design best suits its needs, there are plenty of signs that the country is fully committed to a future air combat program, which will include a crewed fighter as well as complementary drones, and also the JH-XX, which may well be being developed as part of the same ‘ecosystem,’ perhaps even sharing certain subsystems and technologies. The H-20 could also form part of this same broader airpower architecture. The previous boss of Air Combat Command, Gen. Mark D. Kelly, spoke in September 2022 about China’s future fighter program, noting that it was likely to follow a ‘system of systems’ approach similar to the one that the U.S. Air Force has been pursuing and would certainly include a sixth-generation crewed fighter. Gen. Kelly also said he expected the platform — or platforms — to emerge with an 'exponential' improvement in stealth compared with current Chinese aircraft. Of course, a tailless design could help achieve this. An artist’s impression of a generic U.S. Air Force tailless sixth-generation crewed fighter, of the kind being developed under the NGAD initiative. Collins Aerospace Collins Aerospace Notably, the U.S. military’s latest annual report to Congress on Chinese military developments, an unclassified version of which was released on December 18, doesn’t mention potential sixth-generation crewed fighter developments. Chinese officials, meanwhile, have given very little away about the country’s future tactical air combat program. However, in a 2019 interview, Wang Haifeng, chief designer for CAC, described a project that aimed for service entry around 2035. That would also seem to be broadly in keeping with the first flight of a Chengdu demonstrator around now. In the past, Andreas Rupprecht told TWZ that: 'Allegedly, since 2018, CAC and its related 611 Institute have been working on the development of key technologies for the next-generation fighter.' As well as testing for future crewed combat aircraft, China is already heavily engaged in developing various supporting technologies. These include the ability for future crewed combat jets to team with drones, and the use of artificial intelligence, as well as advanced sensors and weapons that will be brought together as part of China’s broader future air combat architecture. While the appearance of one new-generation Chinese combat aircraft design is notable, the apparent emergence of two different such designs in a single day would truly be a milestone. Today’s developments should also be seen in light of the U.S. Air Force’s equivalent Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative, which includes its crewed sixth-generation stealth combat jet. A final decision on this has now been pushed to the incoming Trump administration, amid uncertainty about the Air Force’s ability to pay for NGAD. At the same time, questions have been increasingly asked about the relevance of NGAD in a future high-end combat scenario. A rendering of a notional U.S. tailless sixth-generation crewed fighter, refueling in flight. Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin It will be some time before we get a better understanding of the precise roles and attributes of China’s new combat aircraft designs. However, the country is clearly already committed to developing successors to its current combat aircraft fleet and appears to be looking at how best to achieve significant advances in terms of range, payload, speed, and low observability. While it’s still unclear what China’s next-generation fighter or fighters will end up looking like, and how they might be related to the JH-XX ‘fighter-bomber,’ the current pace of development puts the uncertainty around the U.S. Air Force’s NGAD efforts into even sharper focus.

Anti-Drone Weapon With 24 Barrels Firing Buckshot-Like Rounds Eme...	Russian forces have begun using improvised counter-drone buggies each armed with a weapon made up of 24 barrels that fire shotgun-like ammunition, as well as six AK-series infantry rifles on a single mount. The cluster of shot-firing barrels highlights how shotguns have become a go-to option for both sides of the conflict in Ukraine to help provide local defense against uncrewed aerial threats, but also the limitations of those weapons in this role. A video from the Russian Ministry of Defense, seen below, shows a pair of the new counter-drone vehicles. An accompanying official post on the Telegram social media network says they are based around a chassis taken from an unspecified model of the long-popular 4&#215;4 Lada Niva series.

Alexei Konovalov/TASS The Russian Ministry of Defense says the new buggies can also employ 'heat traps,' a term typically used to refer to thermal countermeasure capabilities like decoy flares. There are launchers at the front of the vehicles, but what exactly they fire is unclear. Flares could be used to try to blind optics, especially infrared and other night vision cameras, on enemy drones.

A video, seen below, emerged online earlier this month showing Ukrainian service members testing commercially available shotgun ammunition against small quadcopter-type drones with poor results. Ukrainian soldiers test the effects of shotgun cartridges on attacking FPV drones.Apparently knocking down an FPV with a shotgun is a challenge. pic.twitter.com/UIa4jbigNb&mdash; Roy (@GrandpaRoy2) December 12, 2024 'A shotgun does not penetrate, does not damage the FPV drone,' a Ukrainian service member says at one point in the video. 'He hit the antenna [on the drone], but it didn't stop him anyway,' another individual says in the clip. Firing a burst of shotgun shells at once from a cluster of barrels could help maximize total damage to the target, as well as increase the overall likelihood of scoring hits. However, the effective range of typical buckshot shotgun ammunition, as well as its penetrative capabilities at longer distances, has long been a limiting factor in the battlefield use of shotguns broadly speaking. As a prime example of this, the U.S. military's abortive late Cold War-era Close Assault Weapon System (CAWS) combat shotgun program notably also involved the development of new ammunition types to try to provide better terminal effects at extended ranges. The War Zone more recently highlighted exactly these issues after the U.S. Marine Corps expressed interest earlier this year in the possibility of acquiring shotgun pellet-like ammunition for its standard service rifles to help defend against drones. New specialized ammunition could still be a way to improve the utility of shotguns and other small arms against drones. Pictures of the shotgun that German gunmaker Heckler &#038; Koch developed in cooperation with the Olin Corporation in the United States for the U.S. military's CAWS program (at left) and special metal-cased buckshot rounds that went with (at right). Heckler &#038; Koch At the same time, engaging small and highly maneuverable drones like FPV kamikaze types with small arms can be a tall order, in general. The U.S. military, among others, has been fielding computerized gun sights on a limited level to help individual shooters better engage uncrewed aerial threats. The Marine Corps has also at least tested another counter-drone system for existing standard infantry rifles that includes an automatically moving buttstock, as you can read more about here. Still, at least when it comes to the U.S. Army, 'kinetic defeat' capabilities involving an 'augmented primary weapon optic&#8230; are considered [a] last line of defense for a squad-sized element,' according to a recent contracting notice.

Smart Shooter A US Marine aims an M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle equipped with the ZeroMark Fire Control System (FCS), which includes an automatically moving buttstock. USMC When it comes to the 24-barrel weapon on the new Russian counter-drone vehicles, there is also a question of how quickly and easily that system can be reloaded after firing. It is important to stress that multiple layers of capabilities would offer the best defense against drones, even just localized attacks by smaller kamikaze types. What the optimal mix of anti-drone systems might be remains a hot topic of debate globally. Options that incorporate guns do look set to be part of that ecosystem for the foreseeable future. Shotguns and other weapons that fire similar pellet-filled ammunition, like the one that has now emerged on the Russian counter-drone buggies, are still very much in the mix when it comes to protecting against uncrewed aerial threats despite questions about their overall utility.

What We Know About the Azerbaijan Airliner That Crashed In Kazakh...	Azerbaijan Airlines Flight JS-8432 crashed in Kazakhstan Wednesday after being fired upon by a Russian Pantsir S1 short-range air defense system, the head of Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR) told The War Zone, while a U.S. official told us that a Russian anti-aircraft system may have struck the aircraft. These claims line up with video emerging from inside the jet and the crash scene as well as reporting by several news outlets indicating the Russian air defense system caused the crash of the Embraer 190 passenger jet that killed 38. The War Zone cannot independently verify these claims while several investigations are underway and Russian, Azerbainanian and Kazakh officials urge restraint in reaching conclusions about the crash. Video taken by a passenger before the crash reportedly showed 'shrapnel holes in the fuselage, consistent with damage from a Russian surface-to-air missile,' according to the Twitter account of the Azeri Times news outlet. 'The footage also shows a woman bleeding from her leg, wounded by shrapnel.'

After reportedly being damaged by the Russian SAM, the jet's communications systems were 'completely paralyzed' by Russian electronic warfare systems, according to Caliber. 'This disruption caused the aircraft to disappear from radar within Russian airspace and only reappeared in the area of the Caspian Sea.' Caliber added that according to Russian sources, 'at the time of the flight over Chechnya, Russian air defense systems were attempting to shoot down Ukrainian drones. The head of the Security Council of the Chechen Republic, Khamzat Kadyrov, confirmed the drone attack on Grozny on the morning of December 25, stating that there were no casualties or damage. In this case, the Russian side should have closed its airspace to civilian aircraft, but this was not done. Why a no-fly zone was not declared over Chechnya remains a significant question.' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned against jumping to conclusions that the Russians fired at the jet. 'It would be wrong to put forward any hypotheses before the investigation's conclusions,' he argued. 'We, of course, will not do this, and no one should do this. We need to wait until the investigation is completed.' A regional Kazakh official appeared to acknowledge Thursday that the investigation is looking into whether Russian air defenses downed the plane but said it is too soon to offer a definitive assessment. Mangystau Regional Transport Prosecutor Abylaibek Ordabayev said they have not yet come to any conclusions about whether that played a role, Reuters reported. Azerbaijanian President Ilham Aliyev said he learned of the crash while he was flying to Russia to attend the informal summit of the heads of state of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) member countries in St. Petersburg on Dec. 25. He promptly ordered his plane to return to Baku and ordered a criminal investigation of the crash. Like the Russians and Kazakhs, he urged caution before determining the cause. 'The commission's task is to fully investigate the matter, examine the causes of the crash and all its details, and provide information both to me and to the Azerbaijani public,' he said. 'According to the information provided to me, the AZAL airline plane, flying on the Baku-Grozny route, changed its course due to worsening weather conditions and began heading toward Aktau airport, where the crash occurred during landing. There are videos of the plane crash available in the media and on social networks, and everyone can watch them. However, the reasons for the crash are not yet known to us. There are various theories, but I believe it is premature to discuss them. The matter must be thoroughly investigated. A criminal case has been launched by the Prosecutor General's Office, and naturally, the Azerbaijani public will be regularly informed about both the results of the commission's work and the progress of the criminal case.' That anyone survived the crash at all is amazing in itself. It speaks volumes about the pilots' ability to fly the stricken jet for nearly 300 miles, including nearly 190 miles over a large body of water, reportedly with disrupted communications and likely by using thrust to help the flight because the left horizontal stabilizer was reportedly rendered inoperable by the shrapnel. Captain Igor Kshnyakin, co-pilot Aleksandr Kalyaninov and purser Hokuma Aliyeva were killed in the crash, according to Euronews, while the other two flight attendants, Zulfugar Asadov and Aidan Rahimli, reportedly survived and were being treated in hospital on Thursday. The crew was hailed as heroes for their ability to maintain flight and keep the passengers relatively calm. Kshnyakin and Kalyaninov 'displayed remarkable airmanship, according to experts, as they managed to fly the stricken plane across the Caspian Sea and crash landing just 3 kilometers short of the Aktau airport runway,' Euronews noted.

In September 2016, a Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team tasked with figuring out what happened to Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) on July 17th, 2014 concluded that a SA-11 Buk surface-to-air missile system downed the hapless airliner, and that weapon was sent into Ukraine from Russia and removed shortly after the engagement. The site where the missile was fired has also been officially pinpointed as just outside the village of Pervomaiskyi, which was held by pro-Russian forces at the time. After the shootdown, in which all 298 lives aboard MH17 were lost, the Buk system was quickly moved back into Russian territory the next day, according to the report 'After the BUK missile had been fired, the BUK-TELAR initially drove off under its own power,' the report concluded. 'A short time later it was reloaded onto the Volvo truck and transported back to the Russian border. During the night, the convoy crossed the border into the territory of the Russian Federation.' There have been several relatively recent cases where air defenses, under pressure of an ongoing or possibly impending attack, have taken down the wrong aircraft. Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752, a Boeing 737-800, crashed shortly after taking off from Tehran Imam Khomeini International Airport at approximately 6:12 AM local time on Jan. 8, 2020 after being struck by two Iranian air defense missiles. The flight was heading to the Ukrainian capital Kyiv and had 176 crew and passengers on board, all of whom died in the subsequent crash. Video footage that subsequently emerged showed the plane engulfed in a fireball before it hit the ground. The shootdown immediately followed an unprecedented Iranian missile strike targeting U.S. forces in Iraq and Iranian air defenses were on extreme alert anticipating the country would be hit in retaliation.

All 176 passengers and crew were perished.

The jet, downed early on December 22 local time, was returning to the aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman during the middle of what a U.S. official told The War Zone was a complex attack. 'After successfully returning from its initial mission, an F/A-18F launched again to provide air defense support from OWAs and ASCMs that were inbound to the force,' a U.S. official told us. 'They were shot down while recovery of remaining aircraft was underway.' According to Fox News, a second Super Hornet narrowly avoided being struck by a missile from the Gettysburg. It may take a while before a definitive conclusion can be reached about what happened to Azerbaijan Airlines Flight JS-8432. However, preliminary reports seem to indicate that once again, neither anti-aircraft systems nor the people operating them, are infallible in the heat of battle.

China Stuns With Heavy Stealth Tactical Jet’s Sudden Appearance	In something of a stunning development, China appears to already be flying a stealthy, high-performance, flying-wing, sixth-generation crewed combat aircraft, imagery of which began to emerge today. At this early stage, we have very little idea about the precise identity of the new aircraft, but many elements of its design are very much in line with what we already knew about Chinese sixth-generation airpower aspirations. pic.twitter.com/IZ9BlwjoOc&mdash; Justin Bronk (@Justin_Br0nk) December 26, 2024 第三圈 pic.twitter.com/GvKReHJ3sm&mdash; 東風 (@eastwind6699) December 26, 2024 Video and photos that began to circulate today on social media show the previously unseen aircraft conducting a daytime test flight, alongside a two-seat Chengdu J-20S fighter, serving as a chase plane. The locations and the dates of the various imagery cannot be verified at this stage, although the presence of the J-20 suggests that the Chengdu Aircraft Corporation (CAC) factory airfield is a likely candidate. The new Chinese combat aircraft accompanied by a J-20S chase plane. via X via X There has also been no official comment from the Chinese Ministry of Defense or state media so far. Aside from the sheer size of the new aircraft, which we will address in a moment, the most striking thing about it is its planform and tailless configuration. It has a modified delta wing with chine lines emanating all the way to the nose area, while its central fuselage section, at least the bottom of it, is loosely reminiscent of the J-20. The broad nose could even provide space for side-by-side crew seating, although the limited views of the canopy mean we cannot be sure whether the aircraft has a single-seat or two-seat arrangement, with tandem twin seats being another option. via X via X via X There was already growing evidence pointing to the fact that China’s next fighter would be tailless, and designs of this kind had previously appeared in the form of technical studies. Back in October 2021, a mysterious tailless aircraft shape appeared in satellite images of a CAC factory airfield. It was a large modified-diamond-like delta planform with a relatively thin nose section; it also had a significant wingspan — broadly similar to that of a J-20. But it's worth noting that this shape does not look the same as the aircraft we are seeing. Beyond that, next-generation tactical combat aircraft eschewing traditional tails is a major design driver being pursued by the U.S., as well. This is predominantly to significantly reduce the aircraft's radar signature across multiple bands and from all aspects. There are some aerodynamic efficiencies also to be had with such a design, especially one used for long-range operations via a reduction in aerodynamic drag, which should provide better performance for sustained high-speed dashes and cruising flight. At the same time, a tailless configuration can adversely affect overall maneuverability, even with the most advanced computerized flight control systems. There are currently no signs of thrust-vectoring engines on this aircraft, which would help enhance agility and overall stability. The engine exhausts are mounted in the best place to mask the aircraft's infrared signature, atop the rear of its fuselage.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION While a tailless configuration, size, general shaping, and exhaust layout point directly toward a design tailored for stealth and endurance, it’s not entirely clear the exact level of enhanced low observability this new aircraft might offer. But just deleting the tail surfaces and strakes and providing a more general aerodynamic clean-up, while leveraging the same now nearly 15-year-old technology found on the the J-20, for example, would still be a massive improvement. Clearly, this aircraft incorporates significantly greater low observable technologies that are a leap ahead of the J-20, beyond its tailless design. Also notable is the elaborate arrangement of control surfaces coupled with the tailless design, with five trailing edge control surfaces per wing. These include prominent split flaps close to the wingtips. These would be used differentially to provide yaw control in the absence of tail control surfaces, as well as deploying simultaneously to serve as air brakes. via X In terms of size, the new aircraft can be compared to the J-20 — the imagery suggests it is at least as long. The J-20 is close to 70 feet from nose to tail. In this regard, this design's twin-wheel main landing gear is also worth noting, providing another pointer to the considerable weight of the aircraft. Above all, its large size would seem to reflect an overarching concern with long endurance with comparatively massive internal volume to accommodate a very large fuel load, as well as weapons and sensors.

Photo by Wang Jingtian/VCG via Getty Images Maybe the aircraft's most unusual feature is its air intake arrangement. It appears to have an air intake on top of the fuselage, as well as twin intakes on either side of the lower fuselage. This has already led to speculation that the aircraft may have a highly unorthodox three-engine arrangement. Unconfirmed rumors point to a powerplant comprising three domestically produced WS-10C turbofans, as used in the J-20. Considering the aircraft's higher gross weight than the J-20, three engines may be necessary in order to meet aggressive performance goals, especially for sustained high-speed flight and operations at high altitudes. Three it is. pic.twitter.com/3nSa3hFWeM&mdash; Mike Pryce (@MichaelJPryce) December 26, 2024 That China has been working on a sixth-generation combat aircraft program is also no surprise. Back in September 2022, Gen. Mark D. Kelly, who was then the head of Air Combat Command (ACC), said that China was working on the same kind of air combat ‘system of systems’ that the U.S. Air Force is pursuing under its Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative, including a sixth-generation manned fighter jet. At the time, Kelly noted that China saw sixth-generation air power, including future manned fighter aircraft, 'greatly the way we see it: an exponential reduction in signature, exponential acceleration of processing power and sensing.' Another key factor would be the ability to 'iterate' improvements aided by open mission systems, Kelly added. via X via X Regarding a potential successor to the J-20, Gen. Kelly warned that China 'are not dummies. They know what they’re doing.' Kelly also said he expected the Chinese sixth-generation air combat program to include an 'exponential' improvement in stealth compared with current platforms. At this early stage, it’s far from clear whether the new aircraft is a prototype sixth-generation fighter, or perhaps a more generalized demonstrator that will test new technologies that could potentially end up on a variety of different platforms, including a large tactical aircraft much like it. It seems almost certain that China, for some time now, has been engaged in preliminary testing of different manned fighter configurations. This development work may also include demonstrators, both sub-scale and full-size, and the new aircraft may well be related to it. via X The aircraft could also be related to a new regional stealth bomber aircraft, which could potentially be a crewed component tied to the broader Chinese sixth-generation airpower initiative. The regional bomber program, known as JH-XX, remains very secretive, but you can read more about what is known about that project here. Previously, it was thought that the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation might be working on the JH-XX, in which case a J-20 chase plane, from the rival Chengdu, would seem less likely. But more likely, at least at this time, this aircraft could be more closely tied to China's version of America's Next Generation Air Dominance initiative, which aimed to develop a similar manned heavy 'fighter'-like aircraft that would work just as much as a command and control node for drones as a classic fighter. Range, sustained speed in cruise, weapons payload, and low observability are all thought to be top priorities of the manned fighter component of NGAD, or at least were. The fighter element of the program is now on hold and still may be canceled entirely, or end up looking very different, under the Trump administration. The fact that this exotic aircraft was flying during the day, in an area where it was seemingly easily photographed also tells a lot about the program's status. It is very likely China intended for this to be seen at this time. Overall, while so much remains unknown, what we can say about this aircraft definitively is that it's a large, very heavy, tactical jet that has had a massive premium put on combat radios and survivability. High altitude operations are also likely a feature of this design, especially if it does indeed feature three engines. But above all else, it should be able to fly over long regional distances and loiter for extended periods on station far from home without tanker support — something China lacks in terms of capacity versus the United States. In other words, it can put targets in the air, on the ground, and at sea at risk in areas where they won't expect a threat from a manned combat aircraft, at least based on China's current inventory. This has real implications for American tankers, airlifters, and reconnaissance aircraft, as well as allied ships and forces operating at forward locales. It would serve as a critical force-multiplying sensor platform operating far forward. Paired with drone wingmen of relevant endurance, its lethality and survivability would be multiplied. In other words, the existence of this aircraft is a very big deal.

U.S. Navy Ship Menus From Christmases Past	Man, is it just me or did Christmas sneak up FAST this year? Is that just a function of getting older? Remember the anticipation as a kid, the countdown that began right after Halloween? Alas, so it goes. Either way, another Christmas is once again upon us. We are grateful to have you all along for the ride. And no matter what’s going on in your life, we hope you enjoy a day of rest and rejuvenation, far away from the demands of the other 364 days of the year. So let’s celebrate with some choice dinner menus from Navy ships during yules past. We’ve even got a longtime TWZ reader chipping in with a menu (thanks, Sean!) Thanks as well to the U.S. Naval Historical and Heritage Command for assembling these culinary time capsules. Merry Christmas and happy holidays. Please stay fed. USS Oregon (BB-3) 1917 Aren't all olives we eat technically ripe? (U.S. Navy) The ship: The Indiana class battleship was commissioned in 1898 and found adventure on the high seas before being decommissioned in 1920. 'Oregon made a dramatic voyage during the Spanish-American war, weathering storms, while encountering harsh gales while passing through the Straits of Magellan, arriving 66 days after she departed,' a Navy history recounts. 'This journey gave evidence for building the Panama Canal as it would be prudent for the United States not to wait again for this transit if emergencies arose.' The good: Potato croquettes are a criminally underrated Potato Delivery Vehicle (PDV), and lemon meringue pie really deserves more of the pie spotlight. The not so good: 'Cluster raisins' sounds like when you open a box of raisins and they’re all stuck together. USS Monterey (BM-6) 1918 That's a tasty menu. (U.S. Navy) The ship: The only ship of its class, Monterey was commissioned in 1893 and soon took on missions that were bigger than what the monitor platform (it literally looks like a platform too!) was envisioned for. 'Though not designed for extended ocean cruising, the big monitor departed San Diego 11 June in company with collier Brutus for Manila,' a Navy history states. 'Sailing via Honolulu and Apra, Guam, the two ships made the 8,000‑mile voyage without mishap, arriving 13 August, and Monterey remained in the Philippines supporting the occupation of Luzon into 1899.' The good: Buttered asparagus tips and grape juice punch. I wonder what grape juice punch tasted like in the days before artificial flavoring. The not so good: Seaman Timmy appears to have typo’d up this menu. If not, the mess should have gone to mast for serving roast turkey with tartar sauce and baked red snapper with giblet gravy. USS Colorado (BB-45) 1926 Scary Santa. (U.S. Navy) The ship: A grand old dame of the fleet by the time World War II broke out, a Navy history nonetheless notes how Colorado did her part: 'In November 1943, Colorado took part in the Tarawa invasion. She supported the landings at Kwajalein and Eniwetok in January and February 1944 and the Marianas operation in June and July. On 24 July 1944, while bombarding Tinian, she was hit by enemy shore batteries, suffering serious casualties among exposed personnel topside.' 'Colorado's next combat duty was off Leyte in November 1944, where she was hit by two ‘Kamikaze’ suicide planes late in the month. Remaining in the combat zone, she supported the Mindoro invasion in December and the Lingayen Gulf landings in January. During March, April and May 1945, Colorado's sixteen-inch guns bombarded Okinawa in support of U.S. troops ashore. In August and September 1945, she covered the occupation of Japan, then departed for the United States.' The good: Pickled eggs are lowkey the best bar/drinking food out there, and cold pork or ham is pure Christmas. The not so good: The menu cover is kind of terrifying, and those two tykes do not look excited to see Ol’ Saint Nick. USS Bridge (AF-1) 1936 Eating good on USS Bridge. The ship: A humble provisions stores ship that helped keep troops supplied during the invasion of Okinawa in 1945. The good: Cauliflower a la parmesan seems ahead of its time, despite the fact that cauliflower is timelessly adaptable and delicious. Also the most aesthetically pleasing menu cover in our collection. The not so good: We discussed this before, but saltines have no right to be a featured player on any holiday menu. USS Lawrence C. Taylor (DE-415) 1945 Reader Sean's Christmas menu that his uncle and family kept for nearly 80 years. The ship (and the contributor): You already know that TWZ has the best readers out there, and that our comments section is without peer. So we’re pleased to share this next entry, submitted by longtime reader Sean, whose uncle served on this John C. Butler class destroyer escort during World War II. It has been passed down by his family through the decades and we are proud to now render it online immortality. 'Menu came from my family member Howard Eiss, who was the sailor on the ship,' Sean told TWZ. 'To the best of my knowledge, this was passed down in the family and I came about it only a few years ago.' The good: Sean keeping this priceless piece of family history for years to come; old-fashioned fruit cake. The not so good: Celery en Branch sounds like the mess got a tad lazy. Still, the ship and its crew had fought hard throughout the Pacific during the war, and had earned this feast by Xmas ‘45. Merry Christmas, everyone!

New Coast Guard Heavy Icebreaker Construction Finally Underway	The construction of the first Polar Security Cutter (PSC) heavy icebreaker for the U.S. Coast Guard is now formally proceeding. Though the milestone is important, it also underscores the PSC program's already massive delays. The first of these new icebreakers was originally supposed to have been delivered this year and may not now arrive until 2029. The Coast Guard is sorely in need of more heavy icebreakers, with only one such ship, which is aging and increasingly hard to maintain, in its current fleet. The Integrated Program Office for the PSC, which the Coast Guard runs together with the U.S. Navy, received approval to proceed with building the first PSC on December 19, according to a press release put out yesterday. Bollinger Mississippi Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi is the current prime contractor for the new icebreakers. VT Halter Marine was originally hired to design and build three of the ships in 2019. Bollinger acquired VT Halter Marine in 2022. An older rendering of what was then VT Halter’s Polar Security Cutter design. Technology Associated, Inc. via VT Halter Marine 'This decision continues work that has been underway since the summer of 2023 as part of an innovative approach to shorten the delivery timeline of these critical national assets,' yesterday's Coast Guard release says. 'The approval incorporates eight prototype fabrication assessment units (PFAUs) that are currently underway or planned.' 'The PFAU effort was structured as a progressive crawl-walk-run approach to help the shipbuilder strengthen skills across the workforce and refine construction methods before full-rate production begins,' the release adds. 'The PFAU process has prepared the government and the shipbuilder to begin full-scale production of the PSC class, resulting in more precise, cost-effective, and reliable construction processes. ' 'The progressive crawl-walk-run approach consists of verifying the processes utilized during the build to ensure design completeness. This includes unit readiness reviews, ensuring engineering, computer-aided design systems accurately transfer numerical control data to automated production machinery and slowing down early prototype module build times to maximize learning and enable improvements in the downstream production, engineering, and planning processes,' the Coast Guard had also said last year when the PFAU work began. 'Each module requires approximately four months of labor, during which time the shipyard will continue recruiting and training additional members of the workforce to manage the transition to production of the lead hull as the prototype modules are completed.' As already noted, the Coast Guard currently has one heavy icebreaker in service, the USCGC Polar Star, which displaces some 13,840 tons with a full load. The PSCs are expected to be substantially larger, displacing around 17,690 tons. Heavy icebreakers, in general, are 'defined as ships that have icebreaking capability of 6 feet of ice continuously at 3 knots, and can back and ram through at least 20 feet of ice,' according to a report from the National Research Council of the National Academies. Metal blocks the US Coast Guard displayed at a PSC-related event in 2023 offering a visual depiction of the differences in hull thickness of a heavy icebreaker, at left, and a typical Coast Guard cutter, at right. A quarter and dime are seen at left and right, respectively, to help provide additional context for the comparitive thicknesses. USCG The PSCs will also be much more modern and otherwise capable vessels than the Polar Star. The latter ship was commissioned in 1976 and has become increasingly problematic to operate despite a multi-phase service life extension program (SLEP). Given its age, just sourcing parts for Polar Star can be troublesome and its sister ship USCGC Polar Sea was sidelined decades ago and cannibalized for spares. The trio of PSCs will be a welcome boost to the Coast Guard's overall icebreaking fleets, as well. Beyond Polar Star, the service has a lone medium icebreaker, the USCGC Healy, which was commissioned in 1999. The USCGC Polar Star, at left, and the USCGC Healy, at right, moored in Seattle on August 25, 2024. USCG Having just two ocean-going icebreakers presents obvious operational limits and increases the risks of capacity gaps as was underscored just earlier this year. Healy suffered a fire that cut its planned deployment short in July. At that time, Polar Star was undergoing phase four of its SLEP. This meant the Coast Guard had no medium or heavy icebreaking capacity at all until Polar Star returned to its home port in August. Healy has also since returned to service and wrapped up a 73-day Arctic deployment on December 12. The question now is when the new PSCs will actually enter service. The mention of the 'innovative approach to shorten the delivery timeline' in the Coast Guard's press release yesterday reflects the substantial delays the program has suffered to date. As mentioned, the lead ship was originally supposed to have been delivered this year. The second and third PSCs would then follow in 2026 and 2027. The schedule slips have been blamed in the past primarily on problems in finalizing the core design. As it stands now, the initial example may not arrive until 2029, a decade after the initial contract award. Concerns are growing about potential cost overruns, as well. There are additional plans to eventually acquire new Arctic Security Cutter (ASC) medium icebreakers, but that effort has yet to begin in earnest. The Coast Guard has acquired an additional existing ocean-going icebreaker, the Aiviq, off the commercial market. However, it's unclear when that ship will enter operational service as it still requires unspecified 'minimal modifications' to meet the requirements for its new U.S. government role. The vessel will be homeported in Juneau, Alaska, and renamed Storis, in honor of a previous Coast Guard light icebreaker of the same name with an impressive service career spanning from 1942 until 2007. At the time of its decommissioning, the previous USCGC Storis was the oldest operational ship in Coast Guard inventory. The previous USCGC Storis (WMEC-38) seen ahead of its decommissioning in 2007. USCG Though a welcome addition, the new Storis will offer an at best limited capacity boost. The Coast Guard itself declared that it 'requires a fleet of eight to nine polar icebreakers to meet operational needs in polar regions' in a separate press release yesterday about it taking formal ownership of what is still currently named the Aiviq. Newly-acquired icebreaker AIVIQ has been renamed by the US Coast Guard as STORIS WAGB21, commemorating an earlier STORIS that served for 64 years and decommissioned in 2007. Coast Guard, of course, has made no public announcement pic.twitter.com/mAuOKsbK1t&mdash; Chris Cavas (@CavasShips) December 7, 2024 Earlier this year, the U.S. government announced a new Icebreaker Collaboration Effort, or ICE Pact, intended to further boost icebreaker capacity in cooperation with NATO allies Canada and Finland. Part of the ICE Pact includes taking steps to increase the icebreaker production capacity to support the needs of friendly nations. 'If we’re trying to build a long-term order book to create the demand signal we need to have the investment that’s required to generate scale,' a senior U.S. official told reporters around the rollout of the ICE Pact back in July. 'What we’re trying to do is to leverage the global order book. And our sense is if we look at allied nations that are trying to purchase icebreakers over the next decade, it’s 70 to 90 vessels.' All of this comes as the strategic significance of the Artic only continues to grow. Receding ice as a result of global climate change has opened up new access to natural resources, from oil and natural gas to fishing, as well as trade routes. New opportunities for potentially violent global competition have emerged as a result. For years now already, the Russian military has been expanding its ability to project air and naval power into the high north and the Chinese government has made clear it has ambitions in the region, as well. Russia also has the largest icebreaker fleet in the world by far, including nuclear-powered and combat-capable types. Finally moving ahead with the construction of the first PSC is an important development for the Coast Guard, but one that also unfortunately highlights the serious continued lag in acquiring these critical ships.

What We Know About The Russian Cargo Ship That Sank In Mediterran...	A Russian cargo ship claimed to be heading to Syria to take part in the Kremlin’s military withdrawal from that country, has sunk in the Mediterranean. The Ursa Major went down overnight between Spain and Algeria. The incident comes amid uncertainty over the fate of the Russian naval base at Tartus on the Syrian coast, which provides Moscow with a vital foothold in the Mediterranean. &#034;Ursa Major&#034;Video - 23.12.2024&mdash; Evgen Istrebin (@evgen-istrebin.bsky.social) 2024-12-24T07:40:04.273Z A Russian ship, Ursa Major, sank off the coast of Spain after an explosion. The cargo reportedly included nuclear icebreaker reactor hatches and two port cranes with a 120-ton capacity, en route to Vladivostok. 14 crew members were rescued, 2 are missing.&mdash; NOELREPORTS (@noelreports.com) 2024-12-24T08:51:12.529Z The Russian Foreign Ministry confirmed the cargo ship sank after an explosion in the engine room, the cause of which remains unclear. A video filmed from a tanker in the vicinity — the Ross Sea — showed the Russian ship listing badly to its starboard side, with its bow low in the water, between 12:00 and 1:00 p.m. GMT on Monday. It then sank at around 1:20 a.m. GMT on Tuesday. One of the ships involved in Russia’s evacuation from Syria, the cargo vessel Ursa Major, reportedly suffered a major engine room explosion in the Mediterranean and sank earlier today. Spanish press reports that 14 crew have been rescued, 2 are missing.&mdash; OSINTtechnical (@osinttechnical.bsky.social) 2024-12-24T00:30:56.858Z Spain’s Salvamento Marítimo maritime rescue agency said it received a distress signal from the Ursa Major on Monday when it was located around 57 miles off the coast of Almería. Two vessels and a helicopter were sent in response. A Spanish patrol boat picked up the 14 crew members from a lifeboat and brought them to the Spanish city of Cartagena. A Russian military vessel also provided assistance, later taking charge of rescue operations. The Russian Foreign Ministry says another two crew members are still unaccounted for. A Spanish Navy vessel (225988522) just popped up on AIS alongside Ursa Major.&mdash; Oliver Alexander (@oalexanderdk.bsky.social) 2024-12-23T20:10:48.897Z The Salvamento Marítimo alerted ships in the area to the 'possibility of shipwreck debris' and urged them 'to keep a sharp lookout, keep a wide berth' and report any sightings to authorities. Based on publicly available ship-tracking data, the Ursa Major had originally departed the port of St. Petersburg on December 11, with Russia claiming that its final destination was Vladivostok, in the Russian Far East. Russian accounts say that the vessel — 467 feet long, with a displacement of 12,679 tonnes — was carrying a pair of 380-tonne cranes to be used in the construction of a new nuclear-powered icebreaker, as well as other components to be used in the build. However, the Ukrainian military intelligence service, or GUR, claimed that the vessel was in fact headed to Syria, to take Russian 'weapons and equipment' out of that country, following the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime. The GUR made its claim on its Telegram channel yesterday after the cargo ship passed through the Strait of Gibraltar. Vehicles and other equipment seen clustered at the end of a pier at Russia’s Tartus naval base in Syria on December 17, 2024. Satellite image ©2024 Maxar Technologies The ship’s owner, Oboronlogistika, is a known Russian military contractor, described as 'part of the Russian defense ministry’s military construction operations.' Built in 2009, the vessel — together with its owner — was placed under sanctions by the United States in March 2022, after the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Since then, the Ursa Major has made frequent trips to Syria, transporting military equipment. Ursa Major had been in the same area of the Mediterranean as another sanctioned Russian ship, Sparta, both vessels having been noted heading through the English Channel last week, under Russian Navy escort. Over the weekend, the Portuguese Ministry of Defense confirmed that the Portuguese Air Force had been shadowing four Russian ships off its coast. As well as the Sparta, these were the drilling operations vessel Bavenit, and two Russian Navy landing ships: the Aleksandr Otrakovskiy and the Ivan Gren.

Portuguese Ministry of Defense Earlier this month, the Ukrainian GUR also reported that Sparta was heading to Russia’s naval base at Tartus on the Syrian coast to move military equipment out of Syria. However, Russian authorities said that the Sparta was sailing to Port Said in Egypt. In an incident yesterday, one of the two ships apparently broke down off the coast of Portugal. The GUR reported the ship involved as the Sparta, although it’s possible it was actually the Ursa Major — which was previously named Sparta III. The Ukrainian military intelligence service said that 'the main engine’s fuel pipe failed' but this problem was relatively quickly addressed and the ship began to move again. The cargo ship Sparta off the coast of Portugal at the weekend. Portuguese Ministry of Defense While it’s not been independently verified that the Ursa Major and Sparta were headed to Tartus, the incidents reinforce the Russian military’s reliance on contractors like Oboronlogistika to move critical equipment out of Syria. This has become even more critical since Ukraine has taken a heavy toll on the Russian Navy’s Black Sea Fleet landing ships, which have been prized targets since the start of the current conflict. What’s still unclear is whether the Russian Armed Forces will depart Syria altogether, or if they will continue to have some kind of access to Tartus and the air base at Khmeimim in Latakia province. Yesterday, a Kremlin official confirmed that Russia was in contact with the new Syrian rulers and was discussing the future of its two military facilities there.

Photo by Izzettin Kasim/Anadolu via Getty Images The importance of Tartus — the only Mediterranean port available to Russia — cannot be understated. With that in mind, it’s not surprising that Moscow is now negotiating with the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) Islamist group that led the offensive against the Assad regime, to ensure continued access. In the meantime, Russian military forces have completed their withdrawal from the Syrian interior, leaving a dwindling presence only at Tartus and Khmeimim. Russian soldiers stand by military pickups as they prepare to evacuate a position in Qamishli in northeastern Syria on December 12, 2024. Photo by Delil SOULEIMAN / AFP DELIL SOULEIMAN Some of the equipment formerly in Syria has been moved to Libya, suggesting that Russia might now be seeking to establish a longer-term military presence there, as an alternative. Some analysts have even suggested that the Ursa Major might have been headed to a Libyan port, with the plan to offload the two 380-tonne cranes there, either to support Libyan National Army commander Khalifa Haftar or to help establish a permanent Russian base. There have been reports that the HTS has demanded that Russia remove the last parts of its military contingent from Tartus and Khmeimim by February 20, 2025, although these are unconfirmed. This step would be in line with the new Syrian government’s aim to have the international sanctions placed on it lifted. Ultimately, the decision on the Russian military presence in Syria will be down to the country’s new rulers. Whatever happens, Russia will be heavily reliant on shipping, either to complete its evacuation from Syria or to re-establish its military presence there under new Syrian leadership.

F/A-18F Was Downed By Friendly Fire As Jets Were About To Land On...	A friendly fire incident in the Red Sea this past weekend that saw a U.S. Navy Ticonderoga class cruiser down an F/A-18F Super Hornet came as jets were returning to the supercarrier USS Harry S. Truman, TWZ has learned. The Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group had also been fending off a sustained Houthi drone and missile attack leading up to the friendly fire incident. You can read more about what is known about this incident in our earlier reporting here. 'After successfully returning from its initial mission, an F/A-18F launched again to provide air defense support from OWAs and ASCMs that were inbound to the force,' a U.S. official told us. 'They were shot down while recovery of remaining aircraft was underway.' The F/A-18F was officially downed early on December 22 local time by a missile from the Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Gettysburg. Aircraft from the Harry S. Truman's air wing had also struck Houthi targets in Yemen on the night of December 21-22.

'The wreckage has not been located and is likely at the bottom of the Red Sea. Both crew members were successfully recovered and are back on the USS Harry S. Truman. Initial reports are that one of the crew members has minor injuries. Both have been evaluated and released from medical.' Earlier today, Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) separately told us that the two-seat Super Hornet had been 'performing a refueling mission' at the time of the friendly fire incident. We had already reached out for more clarification on what exactly the jet's mission had been. Whether or not the jet was providing 'air defense support' or if it was in a tanker configuration primarily to support the jets providing air defense support at the time is unclear. As TWZ noted earlier, F/A-18Fs do regularly provide aerial refueling support for other aircraft in Navy carrier air wings.

USN There are also rumors that another Navy jet was fired upon and almost accidentally shot down during the recovery process aboard the ship, as well, but TWZ has not been able to confirm that at this time. In comments to us tonight, the U.S. official did stress that 'an investigation is underway to determine the facts and circumstances' surrounding the friendly fire incident. Many questions remain about how and why the crew of the USS Gettysburg, the most advanced Ticonderoga class cruiser in operational service at present, which returned to the fleet last year with a slew of major upgrades to its air and missile defense suite and other systems, mistakenly shot down the F/A-18F. The fact that this appears to have occurred during recovery is even more puzzling. Regardless, the details as we understand them now underscore the complexities of the current operating environment that U.S. forces are facing in and around the Red Sea. As TWZ wrote earlier: 'The Red Sea is an extremely high-threat environment with multiple layers of threats, some of which can be very hard to detect and categorize. The Houthis are actively targeting American warships, as well as commercial vessels, with various aerial drones, cruise missiles, anti-ship ballistic missiles, and unmanned surface vessels, often simultaneously. The available time in which to make potentially serious decisions can be measured in seconds.' If nothing else, thankfully both aviators onboard the downed F/A-18F, who have now been released from medical, did not suffer any serious injuries or worse.
