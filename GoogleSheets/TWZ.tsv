Bunker Talk: Let’s Talk About All The Things We Did And Didn’t Co...	Welcome to Bunker Talk. This is a weekend open discussion post for the best commenting crew on the net, in which we can chat about all the stuff that went on this week that we didn’t cover. We can also talk about the stuff we did or whatever else grabs your interest. In other words, it’s an off-topic thread. The caption to this week’s top shot reads: 15th September 1947: The 'ops' room at the secret operational headquarters at Uxbridge RAF station, from where the Battle of Britain was conducted, is now the control centre for the fly past for Battle of Britain week.

If you want to talk politics, do so respectfully and know that there’s always somebody that isn’t going to agree with you. If you have political differences, hash it out respectfully, stick to the facts, and no childish name-calling or personal attacks of any kind. If you can’t handle yourself in that manner, then please, discuss virtually anything else. No drive-by garbage political memes. No conspiracy theory rants. Links to crackpot sites will be axed, too. Trolling and shitposting will not be tolerated. No obsessive behavior about other users. Just don’t interact with folks you don’t like. Do not be a sucker and feed trolls! That’s as much on you as on them. Use the mute button if you don’t like what you see. So unless you have something of quality to say, know how to treat people with respect, understand that everyone isn’t going to subscribe to your exact same worldview, and have come to terms with the reality that there is no perfect solution when it comes to moderation of a community like this, it’s probably best to just move on. Finally, as always, report offenders, please. This doesn’t mean reporting people who don’t share your political views, but we really need your help in this regard. The Bunker is open!

U-2 Spy Planes Are Flying Border Security Missions Air Force Conf...	U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin has confirmed that U-2 Dragon Lady spy planes have been flying missions around the border with Mexico. The service's top officer has also confirmed the use of RC-135V/W Rivet Joint intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft and drones, which TWZ has reported on previously, as part of still-increasing U.S. military support for southwestern border security efforts under President Donald Trump. 'As most of us head into the weekend, I want to thank our U-2, RC-135 & RPA [remotely piloted aircraft; drone] crews who are tirelessly providing unrivaled ISR support for @USNorthernCmd [U.S. Northern Command] at the border to restore sovereignty and protect American communities,' Allvin wrote in a post today on X, a screen shot of which is seen below. 'Stay safe and thank you!' X screen capture CNN was first to report the use of U-2s in support of current operations along the southwestern border back in February, but citing unnamed officials. That story followed news that RC-135V/Ws, as well as U.S. Navy P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol planes, were also flying surveillance missions around Mexico, including sorties over the Gulf of California. A picture that Gen. Allvin included in his post on X today showing personnel boarding an RC-135V Rivet Joint aircraft. USAF A picture the US Navy previously released showing personnel onboard a P-8A patrol plane during a mission along the border with Mexico. USN Petty Officer 2nd Class Andy Anderson In February, there were also reports that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was conducting surveillance flights inside Mexican airspace using MQ-9 Reaper drones. Authorities in Mexico subsequently confirmed that the U.S. government had been conducting aerial ISR to operations inside the country, and that this had helped with the arrest of at least two senior cartel members. Just earlier this week, TWZ reached out to the 9th Reconnaissance Wing at Beale Air Force Base in California, the Air Force's U-2 hub, for more information about the use of those aircraft specifically in support of current border security operations. Those queries were subsequently forwarded first to Air Combat Command (ACC) and then to NORTHCOM. U-2s and other aircraft on the runway at Beale during a so-called 'elephant walk' readiness exercise in 2024. USAF 'At this time, we are not commenting about any specific ISR platforms related to southern border missions,' a NORTHCOM spokesperson told TWZ on Wednesday. 'We do acknowledge that there is ISR supporting the mission, but again, we are not going to be specific about platforms.' 'We don’t discuss specifics on how we are using ISR assets to support DoD’s mission at the southern border,' the same spokesperson added today in response to a follow-up after Gen. Allvin made his post on X. In general, the Air Force's U-2s can be equipped with a wide array of different sensors, many of which could provide useful capabilities in support of border security operations. As TWZ wrote back in 2021 after a U-2 was tracked flying along the southwestern border on what the 9th Reconnaissance Wing said was a routine training mission: 'The Air Force’s U-2Ss can carry a variety of different sensor packages, including panoramic and other wide-angle cameras and radar imaging systems, and one of these aircraft could, conceivably offer a way to relatively quickly get a snapshot of border activity at a particular moment in time, even if [the U-2S with the serial number] 68-10329 did not in this particular case. That same imagery would also be useful for general mapping purposes, including in the creation of radar maps that can show details electro-optical or thermal imagery cannot. The U-2 can also carry communications intelligence gathering payloads.' USAF Imagery and intercepted communications could help in establishing so-called baseline 'patterns of life' in a particular area, or even for a select individual or group of individuals. This, in turn, could aid in the refinement of intelligence gathering strategies, or even be used to plan and execute operations, including strikes and ground raids. As TWZ has previously reported, U-2s are known to have flown sorties over and/or around Mexico on at least one other occasion, in 2009, as part of an operation nicknamed Equis Emerald. The purpose of those flights is unknown. A mention of the Equis Emerald flights in the table of contents of an internal Air Combat Command historical review covering activities in 2009. USAF via FOIA The official acknowledgment that U-2s are supporting current efforts along the border with Mexico comes as the U.S. military continues to expand its overall participation in this mission. Just today, NORTHCOM announced the formal activation of interagency Joint Task Force-Southern Border (JTF-SB) to oversee these operations. 'Under the direction of USNORTHCOM, Joint Task Force-Southern Border (JTF-SB) assumed the role of synchronizer of several USNORTHCOM activities and military forces from Joint Task Force-North (JTF-N). The transfer of authority, or TOA, to JTF-SB aligns efforts to seal the southern border and repel illegal activity under a single Joint Task Force responsible for full-scale, agile, and all-domain operations, which will allow for more effective and efficient DoD operations,' according to a press release. 'Joint Task Force-North [JTF-N] will continue their core mission of detecting and monitoring transnational criminal organizations’ threats within and along approaches to the continental United States.' You can read more about JTF-N, which has been the primary U.S. military entity responsible for coordinating support for border security operations since the early 2000s, in this past TWZ story. 'In early February, Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion, 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry) from Fort Drum, New York, deployed to Fort Huachuca, Arizona, to establish the infrastructure necessary for the JTF-SB headquarters,' the release adds. 'JTF-SB is commanded by Army Maj. Gen. Scott M. Naumann. Additionally, the task force has two deputy commanders: one from U.S. Customs and Border Protection and one from the U.S. Marine Corps.' Marines work to install concertina wire on a section of wall along the border with Mexico in March 2025. USMC Lance Cpl. Nataly Espitia The U.S. military currently has 9,600 personnel either deployed or in the process of deploying to support the border security missions. In addition to fixed-wing aerial ISR assets, this support includes various types of helicopters and elements of Stryker Brigade Combat Team from the U.S. Army. Various branches have also contributed intelligence analysts on the ground, engineers, military police, and other personnel. The U.S. military, at least publicly, has so far been primarily focused on activities on the American side of the southwestern border. However, there continued to be discussions about the potential for direct action against drug cartels inside Mexican territory, possible without cooperation or coordination with authorities in that country. In February, President Trump's administration formally designated eight Latin American criminal groups, including multiple Mexican drug cartels, El Salvador's MS-13, and Tren de Aragua in Venezuela, as foreign terrorist organizations. The designations expand the scope of actions that U.S. authorities could take against these organizations. You can read more about the challenges and potential for serious blowback from any U.S. military operations against Mexican drug cartels in this past TWZ feature. For the U-2 fleet, the new mission along the border with Mexico comes amid the Air Force's continued push to retire the type for good. Some members of Congress had pushed for provisions in the annual defense policy bill, or National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for the 2025 Fiscal Year that would have blocked divesting any U-2s. However, that does not look to have made it in the final version of the bill that was signed into law last year. USAF In the meantime, U.S. Aerial ISR assets, now confirmed to include U-2 spy planes, continue to prowl around Mexico as part of the U.S. military's greatly expanded border security mission.

North Korea’s Suspected New Early-Warning Radar Plane Appears Wit...	New imagery shows the progress made on North Korea’s shadowy airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft, based on an Ilyushin Il-76 Candid airlifter; you can read more about it in our analysis of when it first broke cover. Since the start of this year the aircraft now had its rotodome fitted, putting to bed any suggestion that it's intended for a role other than AEW&C. Satellite images obtained by TWZ from Maxar Technologies show how work on the aircraft has continued at Pyongyang International Airport over recent months. Throughout, the aircraft has remained in a new sectioned-off compound next to a maintenance hangar at the airport. As we reported in the past, the construction of this cordoned-off area seems to have begun in late September or October of 2023. When the AEW&C was first revealed, there was work being undertaken on the top of its fuselage, just aft of the wing, where the radome would eventually be mounted. By mid-December 2023, it seems that the radome mounting had been attached, with the shadow cast by it also visible. A satellite image of the Il-76 at Pyongyang International Airport on December 12, 2023. PHOTO © 2023 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION In early August of 2024, the upper surfaces of the aircraft were draped with some kind of covering, although it’s unclear if this was intended to provide protection to the aircraft while work was being done or if it was intended to shield the aircraft from prying eyes. Satellite image ©2024 Maxar Technologies A month later, that shroud had been removed, with imagery now clearly showing the twin struts associated with the radome mounting, as well as the clamshell fairings on the engine nacelles open for access. By September 8, 2024, there was a large tent erected at the rear of the aircraft and a slightly smaller one at the front, as well as screens alongside the rear fuselage, in an apparent effort to conceal whatever work was happening. A view of the aircraft as of September 3, 2024. Satellite image ©2024 Maxar Technologies The modified Il-76 as it appeared on September 8, 2024. Satellite image ©2024 Maxar Technologies A closer view of the modified aircraft on September 8, 2024. Satellite image ©2024 Maxar Technologies Satellite image ©2024 Maxar Technologies Reportedly, as of November 2024, the aircraft had been moved into a hangar adjacent to the compound and remained there until late February 2025, when it appeared outside the hangar with the radome mounted. Imagery from earlier this month clearly shows the radome itself mounted on top of the struts and the aircraft. Meanwhile, the aircraft has been towed onto a taxiway, its tail pointing toward one of the airport’s runways. These developments were first reported last week by 38 North, a website specializing in North Korea studies. A wider view of the aircraft seen on March 14, 2025. Satellite image ©2025 Maxar Technologies Immediately noticeable is the distinctive triangle design on top of the radome, similar to that seen on certain Chinese AEW&C platforms, but not on Russian ones. In Chinese applications, these kinds of radomes house three non-rotating phased array radars, which provide full 360-degree coverage. It could be that the North Korean design is inspired by this, or it could be that China provided technology or assistance. It’s also possible that the radome houses a different antenna array entirely. 02_closer view of awacs plane_sunan afld_north korea_14march2025_wv2. Satellite image ©2025 Maxar Technologies Wood, Stephen As well as possible Chinese assistance, we have speculated in the past about whether Russia might be helping North Korea build its AEW&C jet. After all, the burgeoning military relationship between Moscow and Pyongyang could provide an opportunity for some kind of technology transfer. Some of the technologies from Russia’s A-50 Mainstay, or even the more advanced A-50U, could perhaps be supplied to North Korea in exchange for weapons and ammunition to be used by Russia in Ukraine. At this point, we simply don’t know whether China, Russia, or both might be involved in North Korea’s AEW&C aircraft. However, the Il-76 is a well-established platform for this type of application. As well as the A-50 and China’s KJ-2000 Mainring, AEW&C versions of the Candid are used by India and have, in the past, also been operated by Iraq and Iran.

FYJS/via Chinese internet A side view of a standard PLAAF KJ-2000, albeit with the serial number censored from the photo. FYJS/via Chinese internet Overall, however, an AEW&C aircraft may be a surprising addition to North Korea’s veteran air force, but it’s one that could make a good deal of sense, as TWZ has explained in the past: 'While it’s questionable to what degree more complex battle management and command and control functions could be mastered by North Korea, and hosted aboard an AEW&C aircraft, the ability to extend airborne radar coverage over considerable distances would be a great advantage, either providing prior warning of a potential attack from South Korea and/or tracking incoming aircraft and missiles during at least the opening moments of a conflict. The data it collects could also be shared with surface-to-air missile operators to help provide extra warning to enhance their operations. More importantly, it would provide a new tool for daily surveillance of North Korean and South Korean airspace and an avenue to learn to better perfect AEW&C capabilities.' In particular, an aircraft of this type would provide a useful surveillance platform to detect low-flying cruise missiles launched from South Korea. With indications that Seoul may be considering fielding nuclear weapons, an adequate means of detecting incoming cruise missiles would become even more important for North Korea. Another low-flying threat is provided by drones launched from South Korea, examples of which have, in the recent past, been spotted flying over Pyongyang. Ultimately, an airborne radar, as found in an AEW&C aircraft, provides a ‘look down’ capability that can spot aircraft, cruise missiles, or drones among the ground clutter and is far less restricted by high terrain compared to ground-based radars. No such radar was previously available to North Korea. On the other hand, there are no signs that North Korea is converting more than a single Il-76 for the AEW&C mission, which means this kind of coverage would be necessarily limited. The aircraft would also be a prime target for South Korea and the United States in a time of conflict with the North. With that in mind, its wartime role might be strictly limited and likely very short-lived. Instead, perhaps, it might have greater value for more routine operations, keeping tabs on movements over the border and providing valuable intelligence and day-to-day surveillance. All in all, the emergence of North Korea’s AEW&C system raises some interesting questions. With questions about the ability of North Korea’s military-industrial complex to develop a fully functioning system of this kind, it’s again not surprising that observers are wondering whether China and/or Russia might also be involved. For the time being, the program remains very much in the shadows and has not been disclosed by North Korea’s state-run media. Nevertheless, the recent imagery does at least provide some insight into the progress that’s now being made on North Korea’s AEW&C aircraft.

Argentine Air Force Went To War With Chaff Made By Pasta Machine	For many reasons, the Falklands/Malvinas War stands out among post-war conflicts, with Argentina’s surprise attack on the tiny British territory, nearly 8,000 miles from the United Kingdom, precipitating a fierce campaign fought on land, at sea, and in the air. The conflict also saw some notable innovations, including the rapid introduction of new weapons and tactics. Surely one of the most unusual, however, was the Argentine Air Force’s effort to provide countermeasures to better protect its aircraft. The bizarre story involves infrared flares, radar-defeating chaff… and a pasta machine. One of two AIM-9L Sidewinders fired by a British Royal Navy Sea Harrier at a pair of Argentine IAI Dagger fighters on May 24, 1982. The missiles destroyed them both. via Rowland White Years after the conflict, a U.S. Air Force pilot asked Pablo Carballo, a Malvinas veteran A-4B Skyhawk pilot, what Argentine airmen felt when the radar warning receiver on their aircraft was activated, alerting them to a possible missile inbound. 'Nothing,' Carballo said. Amazed, the American pilot replied, 'How brave!' 'No, you misunderstood me,' Carballo continued. 'We didn’t really feel anything because our planes had no radar warning receiver.' As Capt. Carballo, who was a squadron leader and operations officer of Fighter Group 5, explains in this anecdote that the Argentine Air Force did not have radar-warning equipment for its fighter-bombers in the Falklands War. As far as self-protection systems such as chaff and flares were concerned, the few examples that were introduced by the Argentines during the conflict were the result of ingenuity. Few of them ended well. As of 1982, the Argentine Air Force (locally, the Fuerza Aérea Argentina, FAA) had no electronic warfare or countermeasures systems in its aircraft. Chronic budgetary problems, as well as the scarcity of guided weaponry in neighboring countries that could pose a threat to Argentina, meant that the purchase of these systems had been ruled out. The Argentine Air Force’s A-4B and C Skyhawk fighter-bombers, Dassault Mirage III and IAI Dagger fighters, and English Electric Canberra bombers, therefore, flew 'unprotected.'

Photo By: Fireshot/Universal Images Group via Getty Images Fireshot In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Argentine Air Force had looked at some upgrade programs that would have included self-protection systems. For example, in November 1980, France’s Thomson-CSF submitted a proposal to integrate Sherloc warning systems, as well as Remora and Caiman countermeasures pods on the FAA’s Mirage IIIEA. In 1981, there were negotiations with Elta of Israel to fit a Boeing 707 with electronic warfare systems (which ended up as a signals intelligence platform) and to install self-protection systems on the fighter and bomber fleets. However, when the Falklands War broke out in April 1982, none of these systems had been installed. An Argentine Air Force Mirage IIIEA. Dassault Aviation Most of the FAA units were taken by surprise by the landing of Argentine troops in the Falklands. It was only after the assault and the British announcements that a task force would head south to retake the islands that work began on various projects that would give the FAA’s aircraft a better chance of survival against an enemy with technology and resources far superior to those available anywhere in South America.

Crown Copyright From the outset, it was considered that the main threats to Argentine aircraft would be British Royal Navy Sea Harrier aircraft armed with AIM-9 Sidewinder heat-seeking air-to-air missiles, as well as ship-launched missiles, mainly radar-guided ones, such as the ramjet-powered Sea Dart. To distract the former, flares were to be launched; for the latter, chaff would be used. A Sea Harrier on the amphibious assault ship HMS Fearless during the Falklands War 1982. The jet had been unable to land at the damaged Sheathbill airstrip on the islands. Photo by Terence Laheney/Getty Images Terence Laheney A number of projects were launched in parallel without full coordination. These efforts involved both the Institute of Scientific and Technical Research of the Armed Forces (CITEFA), the main body responsible for defense research and development. Also involved were various FAA units and civilian institutions. The initial problem was how to manufacture chaff. Only later would thought be given on how aircraft would actually deploy it. Chaff has been used since World War II, where it was known by Allied forces as Window and by the Germans as Düppel. Essentially, it consists of small, thin strips of aluminum (or similar) that appear as a cluster of targets on an enemy radar screen or otherwise saturate it with multiple returns. A Royal Air Force Lancaster releases bundles of Window over the target during a daylight raid on Duisburg, Germany, in October 1944. Right: The same Lancaster drops the main part of its load, comprising a 4,000-pound high-explosive bomb and 108 30-pound incendiaries. Crown Copyright According to an intelligence report from the Southern Air Force (FAS), the FAA’s primary combat command on the mainland, officers at least knew the theory behind chaff and recognized that 'before initiating chaff launch operations, accurate data on frequencies, pulse widths and beam widths of enemy radars to be disrupted must be known.' This was not a problem since the Argentine Navy operated two modern British-made Type 42 destroyers (ARA Hércules and ARA Santísima Trinidad), essentially sister vessels to the Royal Navy’s main air defense warships, the Sheffield class. Therefore, the characteristics of the British Type 965 radars (air surveillance) and Type 909 (Sea Dart fire control) were well known. The capabilities of certain other British naval and air radars were also understood since they had also been offered to the Argentine military in the past. The Type 42 destroyer HMS Coventry was sunk by Argentine Air Force A-4 Skyhawks on May 25, 1982. Photo By: Fireshot/Universal Images Group via Getty Images Fireshot The chaff was to be fabricated using this data. The same FAS report notes that 'considering that chaff is resonant over a very wide band, no excessive effort is required to cut it accurately. Chaff cut off at a length approximately equal to 0.475 times the wavelength of the radar to be disrupted will normally be effective.' As of early May 1982, 140 kilograms (309 pounds) of chaff, cut to saturate radars in the 2-18 GHz frequency, was available at the military air base (BAM) Comodoro Rivadavia, in the province of Chubut in southern Argentina. Other chaff shipments were also due to arrive there. While it’s not clear where the entire stock came from, at least some of it was made by schoolchildren in a distant Argentine province, and some of it was fabricated using a pasta machine. In 1982, Maj. Fernando Rezoagli was head of the technical squadron deployed with the Canberra bombers of Bombardment Group 2 at BAM Trelew, also in Chubut, when he was ordered to return home to faraway Paraná, Entre Ríos, in Argentina’s northeastern Mesopotamia region. His mission: to make chaff. His house in Paraná was close to the II Brigada Aérea hangars. 'I removed a roll of aluminum from the depot, which was used to wrap the exhaust nozzles of the Canberra’s engines and dissipate heat. I phoned my oldest son, who was 15 years old and in high school, and told him to bring three or four classmates home and that each should bring a pair of scissors. And I asked him to tell his younger brother, who was 13, to do the same thing.' Although they cut chaff all night, it was not enough. Discussing the problem, a non-commissioned officer 'told us that he had an idea that could be useful… it involved using a machine to make noodles, taking advantage of the fact that the width of the noodles was similar to that of the chaff. The next day, he showed up at the technical group with an industrial machine that he had borrowed from a pasta factory called Napoli. And we started to work the handle 24 hours a day, for about a week'. In the small museum of the II Air Brigade, there is the pasta machine that was used to make chaff. In front of it is the system installed in the Canberras, with the canisters in which the flares and chaff were placed. via author Once the chaff arrived at BAM Comodoro Rivadavia, it was tested on the aircraft operating from there, the Mirage IIIEA fighters and C-130 Hercules transports. In the case of the Mirage, it was decided to make, by hand, cartridges of about 1.5 inches in diameter 'wrapped in toilet paper, kept in the wrapper with adhesive tape.' They would be placed inside the airbrake and fixed to it with more adhesive tape. As for the C-130s, the chaff 'would be thrown from the door in a bag tied with a string about three meters [10 feet] long and in a trajectory perpendicular to the main axis of the search radar lobe, trying to form a curtain.' The chaff was separated by size. Chaff of 40, 47.5, 57, 71, and 110 millimeters was used for the C-130 bags, and chaff of 16, 37/40, and 85 millimeters for the fighters. These sizes were tailored for the various search and targeting radars based on available intelligence. Chaff installed in the airbrakes was also used by the Dagger fighters deployed at BAM San Julian, in Argentina’s Patagonian region, and BAM Rio Grande, in Tierra del Fuego province, both of these being in the southern part of the country. The problem, however, was the scarcity of the chaff and the fact that pilots would open the airbrakes to decelerate and maintain formation, thus losing the one opportunity they had to use it in combat. The chaff was never used by the C-130s. An Argentine Air Force IAI Dagger passes low over the British landing ship RFA Sir Bedivere in San Carlos Water, Falklands, on May 24, 1982. Photo by Peter Holdgate/ Crown Copyright. Imperial War Museums via Getty Images digitised by Ted Dearberg (IWM) A more sophisticated system was a chaff launcher, designed by CITEFA, of which 10 units were built, initially for the A-4 fighter-bombers. The completed system was tested on June 2, 1982, on an A-4C operating from BAM San Julian, with test launches made from between 100 and 15,000 feet. The system allowed two launches every five seconds and salvo launches of six chaff rounds every four seconds. The target to be jammed was the base’s Skyguard fire-control radar, which was around three to four miles away. However, no positive results were obtained. Other unsuccessful projects included chaff launched by 2.75-inch Folding-Fin Aerial Rockets (FFAR), or from Shafrir 2 air-to-air missiles, or semi-automatic systems proposed by private companies. In the end, the only countermeasures system that appears to have been at least partially successful during the 1982 conflict was the one installed on the Canberra unit supported by Maj. Rezoagli. The system launched chaff (cut by hand or the pasta machine) and, simultaneously, flares. It was the brainchild of the chief of the technical group supporting the Canberras back in Paraná. The system consisted of seven horizontal launchers, parallel to each other, on the tail of the aircraft. In each of the launchers was an aircraft engine starter cartridge (already used), which contained a flare and some chaff. Finally, a cap sealed the cartridge. Seen here unloaded, the chaff/flare launching system was installed near the tail of the Canberra. via author The flare (which was also hastily manufactured) was made of gunpowder that burned at 500° Celsius (932° Fahrenheit) for 15 seconds and floated in the air under a small parachute. A control board in front of the navigator contained a button that launched each of the cartridges containing the flare and the chaff. Prior to installation, the system was tested from a helicopter flying at 200 meters (656 feet), with the flare slowly descending under the parachute and a large cloud of metallic strips floating around it. By May 1, 1982, it was operational. That same day, at 4:20 p.m. local time, three Canberra Mk 62s, complying with Fragmentary Order 1117, took off from their base in Trelew. This was RIFLE flight, and it was tasked with dropping bombs on British landing craft in the islands. The Canberras were all equipped with the improvised chaff/flare systems. Capt. Eduardo García Puebla was the pilot of RIFLE 3, and Lt. Jorge Segat was his navigator. Capt. García Puebla recounts the story, starting when they were 300 kilometers (186 miles) from the target. 'At that moment, something indescribable impelled me to look to the right, forcing the natural position of the seat. I don’t know what mechanism or sense alerted me, but I did. From a cloud, a small whitish flash appeared with astonishing speed. It was heading parallel to my course, towards No. 1 [callsign Pajaro]. When that image was engraved in my retina, I was already shouting with all my strength: ‘Pajaro, break, a missile. Break.’ Simultaneously, I violently activated the throttles to their maximum rate, and the control yoke and pedal to the left and back. ‘Jorge, launch flares and chaff, every 15 seconds!’' The AIM-9L Sidewinder locked onto the hot engine nozzle of the No. 2 Canberra, which had failed to launch flares, shooting it down. Canberra serial B-108 was the example shot down on June 14. Here, it is shown with the armament it could carry, during an exhibition in 1978. The largest bombs are Mk 17s of 1,000 pounds. via author Garcia Puebla and Segat also managed to avoid two other AIM-9L missiles and were able to return to base. The first missile fired shot down the Canberra of pilot Lt. Eduardo Raul de Ibanez and navigator 1st Lt. Mario Gonzalez. It was launched by the Sea Harrier flown by Lt. William Alan Curtis of 801 Naval Air Squadron. Lt. Cdr. Mike Broadwater, in another Sea Harrier, had launched the two missiles that did not hit. You can read all about the success of the AIM-9L in the Falklands in this previous TWZ article. An AIM-9L Sidewinder missile on an 800 Naval Air Squadron Sea Harrier during the conflict.

It also failed to launch chaff and flares and was hit by a Sea Dart missile from the destroyer HMS Cardiff. Launch of a Sea Dart missile. Photo by PA Images via Getty Images PA Images Nevertheless, the use of chaff/flares was customary for the aircraft of Bombardment Group 2 during the war. It’s difficult to determine their effectiveness, however, as the post-conflict reconstruction of events (conducted in the United Kingdom) does not indicate that these systems deflected any missiles heading toward a Canberra bomber.

Ukrainian Long-Range One-Way Attack Drones To Be Tested By U.S. M...	Two Ukrainian drone firms, both partnered with American companies, are among those now set to demonstrate long-range one-way designs to the U.S. military as part of a project called Artemis. The effort is focused primarily on exploring kamikaze drones with extended range that are resistant to GPS jamming/spoofing and electronic warfare threats. This is a clear reflection of key trends observed in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) announced today that it had awarded four contracts under Artemis for the production of prototype drone designs that will then be evaluated under operationally relevant conditions, hopefully well before the end of the year. Two of those deals went to U.S. drone makers Aerovironment and Dragoon Technologies. The other two went to U.S. software firms Auterion and Swan, both of which are paired with unnamed Ukrainian drone companies. Now a decade old, DIU is tasked with helping the U.S. military leverage new and improved commercial technologies to meet various requirements. Aerovironment's Switchblade 600, examples of which have been supplied to the US And Ukrainian armed forces, are among that company's existing portfolio of kamikaze drones. Aerovironment 'DIU is partnering with the Department of Defense Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition & Sustainment (A&S) to execute a FY24 [Fiscal Year 2024] Budget line item directing operational testing of platforms in relevant Electronic Warfare (EW) and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) denied environments,' according to a DIU press release. 'Congressional direction for this effort had a goal to provide loitering munitions capable of operation in an electromagnetic contested environment, at a price point that allows for mass deployment.' DIU says it, together with A&S, evaluated 165 proposals for Artemis over the past four months before settling on the final group to proceed to the operational evaluation phase. 'Flight demonstrations to verify stated capabilities of down-selected companies' have already occurred, according to the DIU release. 'In order to have a successful prototype by the end of FY 2025, the next step is meeting an aggressive testing and integration schedule to complete prototyping and demonstrate success by the end of May 2025.' DIU has not provided any details about actual drone designs that are now set to be demonstrated under Artemis, but it has provided a set of core requirements. 'The final Artemis capabilities will be ground-launched, affordable one-way UAS platforms that operate at ranges from 50-300 km+ [31-186+ miles], launch quickly and expeditiously, navigate at low altitudes, carry a variety of payloads, are rapidly updatable and upgradable, and functional in disrupted, disconnected, intermittent and low-bandwidth and Global Navigation Satellite System denied environments,' according to today's release. One of Dragoon Technologies' existing drone designs. Dragoon Technologies It is also worth noting here that the line between longer-range kamikaze drones and traditional cruise missiles is becoming increasingly blurry. An uncrewed system meeting DIU's Artemis requirements, which include the ability to 'carry a variety of payloads,' could be adapted to other roles, including acting as a decoy while carrying an electronic warfare system. Loitering munitions can also have inherent secondary surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities. Aerovironment's Switchblade 600 loitering munition already meets at least some of the DIU requirements based on publicly available information. Aerovironment is a major supplier already of kamikaze drones and other uncrewed aerial systems to the U.S. military and other armed forces globally, including that of Ukraine. Just last year, the company secured a contract from the U.S. Army for Switchblade 300s and 600s valued at nearly $1 billion. Dragoon Technologies has also previously received multiple smaller contracts from the U.S. military and other U.S. government agencies for the development of relevant low-cost/single-use drone capabilities. Without knowing the identities of the Ukrainian companies involved, it is impossible to say what their designs might look like, but firms in that country have already demonstrated a wide array of longer-range one-way drones in the ongoing conflict with Russia. This includes propeller and jet engine powered types, as well as ones converted from crewed civilian light aircraft. Many of these types have maximum ranges well beyond what DIU says it is looking for with Artemis, and have been used to good effect on airbases, oil and natural gas infrastructure, and other strategic targets deep inside Russia.

Russian forces have been notably successful in disrupting Ukraine's employment of Western-supplied precision munitions that use GPS-assisted guidance. Though DIU's announcement today does not explicitly mention the conflict in Ukraine, it does say that the 'Project Artemis goals are directly tied to observations of current real world combat conditions as well as feedback from end users across the DoD on what capabilities may be needed in this space to face near peer threat capabilities around the world.' Artemis also reflects larger concerns within the U.S. military about the adequacy of current stocks of longer-range munitions and the ability to relatively quickly and affordably replenish them. Lower-cost standoff munitions in particular are increasingly seen as a critical way to bolster existing stockpiles ahead of a potential high-end fight, especially one in the Pacific against China, and to help sustain that inventory during a protracted conflict. Expanding the available supplier base for such munitions beyond traditional defense contractors is also viewed as a key element of these efforts. 'We are excited about the non-traditional companies who are providing low-cost, adaptable, long-range, UAS platforms with the potential to maximize operational flexibility for the Joint force,' Trent Emeneker, the program manager for Artemis at DIU, said in a statement today. 'This was the intent of Congress’ direction to rethink how to get capabilities to the warfighter at speed and scale that can deliver much faster than traditional Programs of Record.' DIU has a separate effort underway in cooperation with the U.S. Air Force called the Enterprise Test Vehicle (ETV), which is similar in some respects to Artemis, but is focused on demonstrating designs that could evolve into low-cost cruise missiles. The Anduril Barracuda-500M, one of the designs now being developed under the Enterprise Test Vehicle program. Anduril U.S. military officials have also highlighted the potential value of long-range one-way attack drones for smaller allies and partners. 'What we’ve seen with Ukraine and Russia [is] that there’s a lot of cheap systems that enable the exquisite and we have countries here in NATO that would be happy to build those… because they can’t afford the exquisite stuff,' Air Force Gen. James Hecker said during a virtual talk hosted by the Air & Space Forces Association’s (AFA) Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies last July. 'And that can be complementary to the exquisite and, sometimes, it can actually do the mission by itself.' 'And then you throw in the high-low mix, where now I can take 15 countries that really couldn’t afford and couldn’t help a whole lot within NATO with exquisite stuff, now they can purchase one-way UAVs that can make the exquisite better or sometimes even do the mission,' Hecker, who was and still is head of U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) and Air Forces Africa (AFAFRICA), as well as NATO’s Allied Air Command, added at that time. If nothing else, DIU's Artemis project, which will now test one-way drone designs from Ukrainian firms, underscores the significant impact that conflict continues to have on military trends globally.

Ground Launched Small Diameter Bomb Headed To Ukraine For Its Sec...	Improved versions of the Ground-Launched Small Diameter Bomb (GLSDB) are reportedly among the weapons that will be sent to Ukraine after the United States decided to resume military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv. The GLSDB had made its combat debut in Ukraine, but it reportedly performed poorly there, especially due to the effects of Russian electronic warfare, and was last used 'months ago.' According to the Reuters news agency, which cites two unnamed individuals familiar with the weapon, the next batch of GLSDBs for Ukraine will be 'upgraded to better counter Russian jamming.' The GLSDB is back on the table for Ukraine after President Donald Trump’s administration agreed on Tuesday to restart weapons transfers after Kyiv said it was willing to back a U.S. proposal for a 30-day ceasefire with Russia. According to the same report, the GLSDB is especially needed to fill the gap after the significant depletion of Ukraine’s stocks of the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS). This is a short-range ballistic missile that has had considerably more success on the battlefield. Few details are available of the upgrades made to the GLSDB, although TWZ has approached the co-manufacturer, Saab, for more information. The Reuters report states that the modifications to the weapon include 'reinforcing connections within the weapon to enhance its resilience.' This seems to suggest that some work was needed to make the weapon better able to withstand the stresses involved in the launch process, during which it’s propelled by a rocket motor. To mitigate the effects of electronic warfare, some kind of GPS hardening is a distinct possibility. The report adds that 19 GLSDBs were test-launched in recent weeks to confirm the effectiveness of the upgrades. Originally developed by Boeing and Saab, the GLSDB is a surface-launched, standoff precision strike weapon based on the air-launched Small Diameter Bomb (SDB). Each GLSDB round consists of two existing components, the air-launched GBU-39/B SDB and the rocket motor from the 227mm-caliber M26 artillery rocket. The M26 is among the rocket types that can be fired from the M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS), and variants thereof, and the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS). A scale model of a complete GLSDB round. Joseph Trevithick For the initial boost/loft phase, the GLSDB is propelled by the M26 rocket motor, after which pop-out wings are deployed and the munition flies unpowered, as a glide bomb. It uses the GBU-39/B’s existing inertial navigation system and embedded GPS to guide it to its target. The GLSDB has a range of around 94 miles, making it especially relevant to Ukraine as it seeks to target Russian supply lines and muster points. In the past, Saab has claimed that the GLSDB’s guidance system ensures accuracy to within three feet. Prior to the weapon’s use in Ukraine, the company has also said that the GLSDB is resilient to electronic warfare jamming. However, reports out of Ukraine suggest that the GLSDB proved vulnerable to Russian countermeasures, something that saw the weapon reportedly discarded by the Ukrainian Armed Forces. On the other hand, it should be noted that the air-launched SDB appears to have performed very well with the Ukrainian Air Force, making accounts of the GLSDB’s susceptibility to jamming at least somewhat puzzling. However, since the GLSDB has almost twice the range of the SDB, any loss of GPS data over parts of the flight is likely to have a much bigger impact. The SDB was initially integrated on Soviet-era combat aircraft, with the aid of a specially prepared pylon, and is now part of the armory of Ukrainian Air Force F-16s, too. GBU-39/B SDBs loaded on a Ukrainian Air Force MiG-29 Fulcrum fighter. via X Once the new GLSDBs reach the battlefield, we may learn more about their particular improvements and the capabilities they bring. Meanwhile, the development of an improved GLSDB is a logical step, considering the effect that Russian GPS jamming, in particular, has had on the efficiency of Western precision-guided ground and air-launched munitions used by Ukraine. As the conflict has continued, Russian forces have significantly expanded their use of various kinds of electronic warfare capabilities. At the same time, the broader arguments in favor of the GLSDB remain. The weapon offers significantly greater reach than the longest-range 227mm artillery rockets currently available for the M270 MLRS and the M142 HIMARS. The GLSDB also offers notable versatility in that it can be fired from a number of different launchers, including the M270 MLRS tracked launcher and the M142 HIMARS, which is based on a wheeled chassis. At this stage, we don’t know what kind of launcher Ukraine was using for its GLSDBs, and its 'launcher-independent' nature means it can be fired from other interfaces, too. An artist’s concept of multiple GLSDBs being used in a simultaneous attack on a hostile mobile missile launcher. Saab A further key advantage is the fact that M26 rockets and the GBU-39/B SDB are widely available in the stockpiles of the United States and other allies. All of these are of little value, however, if the weapon itself is found wanting once exposed to the realities of combat. Now, it seems, work is well underway to address the issues with GLSDB and Ukraine will hope that this weapon finally fulfills its potential.

Out Of Control Tanker Plows Into Docked Brazilian Navy Vessels	Videos have emerged showing an out of control commercial oil tanker hitting a row of three Brazilian Navy patrol boats, as well as the pier, in the Port of Santos along the country's southeastern coast last night. The Brazilian-flagged Olavo Bilac suffered an issue with its rudder while maneuvering between piers, according to multiple Brazilian media reports citing the Port Authority of Santos. The incident happened at around 11:20 PM local time on Wednesday. The Port of Santos is situated just to the southeast of the city of São Paulo. As can be seen in the videos below, which offer views of the incident from what appears to be a closed circuit camera at the port and the ship's deck, the nearly 817-foot-long (249-meter-long) Aframax class tanker first went careening into a pier after the loss of rudder control. It then struck a moored patrol boat, which was then pushed into two other patrol boats.

F-15EX Production Heats Up	TWZ’s Jamie Hunter recently caught up with Robert Novotny, Boeing’s executive director for F-15EX business development, who provided the latest on the U.S. Air Force’s newest fighter, the Eagle II, which was recently the subject of high praise in the latest annual report from the Office of the Director, Operational Test & Evaluation (DOT&E). Right now, Boeing is preparing to start to deliver Lot 2 of the Air Force’s F-15EX order, and the first aircraft in this batch — tail number 9 — flew earlier this month. Meanwhile, delivery of the eight Lot 1A and 1B jets was completed in June 2024, with six of those aircraft going to developmental testing at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, and two for the type’s first operational unit, the 142nd Wing of the Oregon Air National Guard in Portland, Oregon. As Novotny discusses in the video, some of those Eglin F-15EXs recently took part in the latest edition of the Bamboo Eagle exercise off the California coast, which you can read about here. The large-force exercise series has quickly become one of the most important for the U.S. military, as well as key allies, and has a clear eye on preparing for a future coalition fight in the Pacific with China — a potential conflict in which the F-15EX would very likely play an important role. U.S. Air Force photo by 2nd Lt. Mary Begy Novotny also alludes to teaming with unmanned aircraft and the F-15EX’s ability to carry outsized weapons, which is something else that TWZ has looked at in detail in the past, as well as its current installation of the Eagle Passive/Active Warning Survivability System, or EPAWSS, which you can read more about here. Finally, there are some very interesting items on Novotny’s ‘wish list’ for future F-15EX capabilities, namely smart expendables, a towed decoy, and enhancements to the infrared search and track sensor available to it. The video below, shot at the Air Force Association’s 2025 Warfare Symposium in Aurora, Colorado, last week, gives us the full view on where the F-15EX program is at right now.

T-45 Goshawk Navy Jet Trainer Fleet Grounded	The U.S. Navy has temporarily grounded its T-45C Goshawk trainer fleet after the Rolls-Royce Turbomeca Adour F405-RR-401 engine in one of the aircraft suffered damage due to a malfunction on Tuesday. The jet was on the ground at the time. In a reply to our inquiries on the potential of grounding of the T-45 fleet, the Navy's Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) and Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) both replied with the following: 'Out of an abundance of caution, operations of all T-45C Goshawk aircraft have been paused while the Chief of Naval Air Training and Naval Air Systems Command assess the fleet’s ability to safely resume training. At approximately 3 p.m. CST on Tuesday, March 11, 2025, a T-45C Goshawk assigned to Training Air Wing 2 in Kingsville, Texas, experienced an engine malfunction prior to takeoff. The aircrew sustained no injuries. Damage to the aircraft engine was reported. CNATRA is investigating the incident as NAVAIR spearheads the engineering investigation. As always, the safety of our aircrews remains top priority.' A T-45 Goshawk training aircraft is waved off from making an arrested landing aboard the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN 71). The T-45 is used for intermediate and advanced portions of the Navy and Marine Corps pilot training program for jet carrier aviation and tactical strike missions. U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Jonathan Snyder (Released) MC3 JONATHAN SNYDER, USN The T-45 fleet acts as the Navy's singular fast jet trainer aircraft, taking prospective Naval Aviators from their first jet hop to landing on the carrier along their path to earning their coveted wings of gold. The aircraft has been in service for three-and-a-half decades and the Navy has been exploring replacement options and concepts, although the timeline for acquiring this new aircraft was pushed back substantially last year. The Goshawk has had its fair share of issues in recent years, from a high-profile onboard oxygen generation issue to a number of crashes. Just last year, the T-45 fleet was grounded twice due to engine issues. Another grounding occurred in 2022 over the jet's powerplant. Around 190 T-45s fly for the U.S. Navy today. With yet another stand-down of operations over the jet's engine, it will be interesting to see if the Navy changes course and accelerates the replacement of the Goshawk fleet.

Our Best Look Yet At China’s New ‘Invasion Barges’	New imagery has appeared of one of China’s new ‘invasion barges,’ which involves a temporary pier that can be connected to other vessels via a barge, or series of barges, with jack-up supports for more stability. The development of jack-up barges is widely seen as part of preparations for a possible invasion of Taiwan by the People’s Republic of China. At the same time, they also reflect the growing use of ostensibly non-military maritime assets to support amphibious operations by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN). A new video showing three of the jack-up barges deployed in tandem on a still-unidentified beach began to circulate recently on social media channels.

This development was identified by Tom Shugart, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) think tank. In this 9 March image, we can see that three of the LPTs have left (numbers 6, 2, and 1 from the previous thread).As such, one 4-, one 6-, and one 8-pillar LPT have departed, with one of each still under construction. pic.twitter.com/fXFOOBu302&mdash; Tom Shugart (@tshugart3) March 13, 2025 Shugart refers to the barges as T-LPTs, for civilian-crewed auxiliary landing platform — transfer. According to his analysis, the three barges in question left Longxue Island sometime after March 9. Another three are still under construction at the GSI facility. 'After seeing the departure of these vessels, I went back and observed AIS data to see if the vessels were using AIS,' Shugart wrote on X, in reference to the automatic identification system that uses transceivers on ships to monitor their movements. 'What I saw was indications of tugs getting these ships underway, but no AIS from the ships themselves, unlike other commercial vessels.' Clearly, China either doesn’t want these vessels to be tracked or they are actually PLAN vessels. There is a precedent for the former, with dual-purpose ferries that take part in Chinese military exercises also not using AIS. Most interesting, perhaps, is the way that the jack-up barges are deployed. Initially, analysts predicted that the three different-sized barges would likely be used independently, creating different-size mobile causeways leading to the beachhead. In the latest imagery, the three barges are coupled together to create one long causeway. Shugart calculates that this should be around 850 meters (930 yards) long.

The latest development follows a previous image that appeared in January, showing a Chinese commercial roll-on/roll-off (RO/RO) ferry linked to a temporary pier via a different type of barge, with at least two — and possibly more — jack-up legs. TWZ provided an analysis of this earlier image at the time. An illustration of the approach for PLA over the beach-landing tests and training.

Report - Critical intelligence delivered to your inbox. #China #Guangzhou pic.twitter.com/EElgZv2rM2&mdash; AllSource Analysis (@AllSourceA) January 10, 2025 As we have noted in the past, there is a precedent for these kinds of temporary piers or causeways in a military context. Only recently, the U.S. military made brief use of a temporary pier system to help increase the flow of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. However, a squall broke apart that pier, putting it out of action for a while and demonstrating the potential vulnerability of such structures to severe weather. Where the Chinese system differs, however, is in its use of struts, which literally jack the barge up, making it more stable and resilient to bad weather and able to remain in action in heavier sea states. This should also result in a much higher throughput of cargo, vehicles, and personnel. On the other hand, the construction also makes for a notably large target and very static high-value target, suggesting that it would be most relevant after an initial landing, supporting the arrival of mass follow-on forces and supplies after a degree of tactical stability has been established. As can be seen in the new video, the barge closest to the beach has four prominent jack-up legs, the second barge has six, and the third and final one appears to have eight. A still from the video provides a full view of the interconnected jack-up barges extending to the beach at an unidentified location. via X At the same time, jack-up barges are not new, with perhaps the best-known military example being the employment of so-called Mulberry harbors by Allied forces following the D-Day landings in Normandy, France, during World War II. China, meanwhile, has at least a decade of experience using both semi-submersible and jack-up barges to connect ships, including ostensibly commercial RO/RO ferries, and temporary piers/causeways. By now, there’s little doubt about the size and scope of the PLAN’s amphibious warfare aspirations and the fact that it expects to rely on commercial capabilities as well as distinctly military vessels. Having access to this kind of additional capacity is widely seen in the context of supporting an invasion of Taiwan, although it has relevance in many other potential scenarios. The advantages of a hybrid military/civilian amphibious force could be leveraged for future military operations elsewhere in the Indo-Pacific, as well as for disaster relief and humanitarian assistance activities. The importance of civilian vessels to China’s expanding amphibious capabilities is also underlined in the Pentagon’s most recent annual report on Chinese military developments, released in December last year. This states: 'Although the PLAN has not invested in the large number of landing ships and medium landing craft that analysts believe the PLA would need for a large-scale assault on Taiwan, it is possible the PLA assesses it has sufficient amphibious capacity and has mitigated shortfalls through investment in other operational capabilities, such as civilian lift vessels and rotary-wing assets to address this gap. The PLA may have confidence in the PRC’s shipbuilding industry’s massive capacity to produce the necessary ship-to-shore connectors relatively quickly.' The value of temporary piers in this context has also not gone unnoticed. 'An over-the-shore capability like the floating causeway will be a critical capability in a Taiwan invasion, giving the PLA the capability to bypass damaged or sabotaged ports and harbors with an independent, relocatable off-shore loading and unloading capability,' a report from the independent China Maritime Studies Institute published last year explains. 'At least through 2030, the PLA’s reserve civilian merchant fleet is probably unable to provide significant amphibious landing capabilities or the maritime logistics in austere or challenging environments necessary to support a large-scale, cross-strait invasion of Taiwan. That said, if current trends in training and exercises continue, the PLA may be able to effectively leverage civil maritime shipping on a large enough scale to support a major amphibious operation by the mid-2030s.' Why a Chinese Mulberry concept makes sense, if they are serious about preparing for a possible invasion of Taiwan. Worth saying again that a full scale invasion would be the most complex operation in history, especially against the spectre of US and poss Japanese intervention.&mdash; Thord Are Iversen (@thelookout.bsky.social) 2025-03-13T09:47:57.647Z An invasion or some other kind of military intervention against Taiwan on this kind of timeline is something that U.S. military officials have warned about for some time now. In the past, it had been suggested that Beijing might be able to launch such an operation by 2027, if not before, although U.S. officials have since stepped back somewhat from this more pessimistic analysis. Nevertheless, the broad consensus in U.S. military circles is that Beijing remains committed to ‘unifying’ Taiwan with the mainland and that the Chinese military is working toward achieving the capabilities required to do this, however long that might take. The continued development of jack-up barges suggests that these — as well as RO/RO ferries — will likely have an important role to play in any future Taiwan intervention. On the other hand, they are also relevant for a host of other potential applications as the PLAN continues to rely on commercial capabilities to boost its amphibious capacity.

Putin Open To Ceasefire Deal But Says 'Nuances' Must Be Addressed...	Russian President Vladimir Putin has come out ostensibly in favor of a U.S.-brokered proposal for a total 30-day pause in his country's war on Ukraine. However, Putin also laid out significant 'nuances,' including questions about whether Ukraine will be allowed to mobilize and train forces, as well as continue to receive Western military aid, during any ceasefire. This, in turn, hints at demands that authorities in Kyiv could find impossible to accept. Putin gave his first public response to the ceasefire proposal today during a press conference in Moscow alongside Belarus' dictatorial President Alexander Lukashenko, a longtime Kremlin ally. Ukrainian authorities had agreed in principle to the U.S.-backed deal on Tuesday following negotiations with their American counterparts in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. 'We agree with the proposal to stop the fighting. But we proceed from the fact that this cessation should lead to long-term peace and eliminate the root causes of this crisis,' Putin said, according to a translation of his remarks from Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. 'We are for [a cease-fire], but there are nuances.' BREAKING: 'We agree with the proposals for the ceasefire' Vladimir Putin says he agrees with proposals for ceasefire - but adds he has questions and Russia 'now on offensive in all areas'Live updates Sky 501 and YouTube pic.twitter.com/f5SgPkYGVo&mdash; Sky News (@SkyNews) March 13, 2025 Putin's list of 'nuances' are not insignificant. 'What do we do about the incursion into the Kursk region? If we halt hostilities for 30 days, what does that mean? That everyone who remains there will be allowed to leave without a fight? Should we just let them go after they committed numerous crimes against civilians? How will this work? It’s unclear,' Putin said, according to Ukraine's UNITED24 Media. 'Ukraine could use a temporary ceasefire to mobilize and receive weapons; the question of how to control this must be resolved.' Earlier today, Yuri Ushakov, an advisor to Putin, had pushed back on the viability of the U.S. ceasefire proposal in an interview with Russia's state-run Channel 1 television channel. Ushakov said such a deal would be 'nothing other than a temporary breather for Ukrainian troops' if it came without major preconditions. Russia has rejected the 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine proposed by the US.Yuri Ushakov, Putin's foreign policy advisor, says this would be 'nothing other than a temporary breather for Ukrainian troops.' pic.twitter.com/fbrwJf82bE&mdash; max seddon (@maxseddon) March 13, 2025 Putin's initial reference to the 'root causes' of Russia's all-out invasion of Ukraine has also been widely seen as a nod to the Kremlin's long-standing maximalist positions regarding the conflict and Ukraine's future territorial integrity and sovereignty, or lack thereof. The Russian President today also claimed that his forces were on the offensive on all fronts in the conflict, including in Kursk, which Ukrainian forces have occupied a part of since August of last year. He added that any ceasefire agreement would have to be dependent on conditions on the ground. Putin says he 'supports the idea' of the ceasefire but wants it to lead to a long-term settlement of the 'root causes' of his invasion of Ukraine. That means he hasn't dropped his maximalist demands. He also has issues about implementation because Russia is currently winning. pic.twitter.com/n2B1Lff4Re&mdash; max seddon (@maxseddon) March 13, 2025 At the press conference today, Putin also notably thanked Trump for the attention given to the conflict in Ukraine and indicated a call with the American President could be on the horizon. Trump administration officials, especially Vice Preisdent J.D. Vance, had previously accused Zelensky of not being sufficiently grateful for U.S. support. A U.S. delegation led by Steve Witkoff is in Moscow and is expected to meet with Russian officials about the ceasefire proposal. This is despite earlier indications that the Kremlin did not see Witkoff as a suitable negotiator. How Ukrainian officials respond to any conditions on a ceasefire deal from the Kremlin remains to be seen. However, the demands that Putin has hinted at so far could be hard for Kyiv to accept, especially without any kind of reciprocal assurances from Russia. Just on Tuesday, the U.S. government agreed to restore the flow of military aid to Ukraine, as well as restart intelligence sharing with that country, following Ukrainian President Zelensky's agreement on the basic terms of the proposed ceasefire deal. The cutoff had come following an unprecedentedly heated public exchange between Zelensky and President Donald Trump at the White House in February. 'We'll take this [ceasefire] offer now to the Russians and we hope they'll say yes to peace. The ball is now in their court,' U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio had said on Tuesday. 'If they say no, then we'll unfortunately know what the impediment is to peace here.' With Putin's position as it has been laid out now, there are clearly issues that need to be resolved before any ceasefire deal with Ukraine can come into effect. More so, a temporary ceasefire is just that. Either side can use it as a tactical opportunity just as much as one that aims at achieving a longstanding peace. With both sides resource-stretched and war-weary, it remains anyone's guess how all this will actually play out. But the fact that Putin did not reject the proposition outright is at least a sign that achieving such cessation of fighting may be possible.

B-52 Re-Engining Plan Comes Into Sharper Focus	The U.S. Air Force's goal has been to finish re-engining the last of its fleet of 76 B-52 bombers by 2035, but this schedule might now slip to the following year. This would extend the total time between the original Commercial Engine Replacement Program (CERP) contract award and the completion of the upgrade work to around 15 years. Delays and cost growth have already beset the CERP effort. At the same time, we are gettin new information as to what will be included in one of the re-engining kits. In 2021, the Air Force announced it had selected the F130 as the winner of a competition to re-engine its remaining operational B-52Hs, something that had been a topic of on again-off again discussions for decades at that point. The B-52's original manufacturer, Boeing, is the prime contractor for the actual integration work, which requires a host of additional modifications to the aircraft. The resulting bombers, which will also get an array of other upgrades and are currently expected to serve into the 2050s, will be redesignated as B-52Js. The B-52Hs were the last of these bombers produced and the final example rolled off the Boeing production line in 1962. The aircraft have received various improvements and updates already since then. 'The B-52J CERP production phase' includes 'procurement and/or production of aircraft components to support installation of new engines and associated sub-systems onto the B-52 aircraft. (engines will be provided separately by the Government),' according to a recent Air Force contracting notice. 'Building, storing, and delivering aircraft modification kits to Tinker AFB [Air Force Base] or other designated locations, if required, on an as needed basis through the production phase for up to 76 B-52H aircraft including additional spare parts, production tooling and support equipment to support installations in a five-to-eight-year period, starting FY28 [Fiscal Year 2028].' An eight-year period starting in Fiscal Year 2028 would wrap up in Fiscal Year 2036. The 2036 fiscal cycle will start on October 1, 2035 and end on September 30, 2036. As of 2023, the Air Force said it was looking to complete the CERP effort by 2035. The contracting notice does say that the Air Force's goal remains to have its first two B-52s with the new engines by 2028, which will be used for ground and flight testing purposes. 'Prior to the B-52J production phase, the Boeing Company will develop aircraft modification installation drawings [and] select aircraft modification component suppliers,' it adds. Details about the anticipated contents of the B-52J CERP 'modification kits' are also included in the notice and are as follows: Engine Struts (OEM Spirit Aero) Integrated Drive Generators (OEM Collins) Hydraulic pumps (OEM Parker) Engine nacelles and fairings (OEM Spirit Aero) Generator Control Units (OEM Collins) Hydraulic reservoirs Engine throttle controls Power distribution boxes (OEM Boeing) Power wiring Engine start switches Air starter auxiliary unit (OEM Honeywell) Control wiring Engine instrument display (OEM L3 Collins) Air starter auxiliary unit controller Attachment hardware Engine data concentrator units (OEM Boeing) Hydraulics panel in cockpit Pneumatic pre-coolers Electrical panel in cockpit Pneumatic components and ducting Anti-ice systems (OEM Liebherr) Air Data System Probes (OEM Collins Rosemont) True Air Temp Sensors (OEM Collins Rosemont) The CERP program centers on a one-for-one replacement of the eight TF33 engines that currently power the B-52, a decision made to try to reduce the cost and complexity of the upgrade effort. However, the list above underscores that the work entails much more than just installing the new F130s under the wings of the bombers. The re-engining effort is set to give the bombers substantially better fuel economy and reduce maintenance demands, which, in turn, are expected to cut sustainment costs and provide operational benefits, including extended range, as you can learn more about here. The TF33 is a 1950s-era design that has been out of production since 1985 and is now very costly to operate and maintain. Members of the US Air Force work on a TF33 engine on a B-52H. USAF Though a possible slip in the completion timeline for the CERP program from 2035 to 2036 isn't great, it does speak to the larger issues the effort has already faced to date. Those difficulties could, in turn, eat into the benefits that re-engining the B-52s is supposed to provide. Last year, it emerged that the Air Force might not even start flying operational missions with B-52Js until 2033, three years later than expected and 12 years after the initial CERP contract was signed. It is also possible that steps the Air Force and Boeing are taking now, including starting the search for possible vendors to help put the modification kits together, could help mitigate existing delays. On the other hand, the program is still quite young and additional delays could spring up as a result of production and flight testing. Boeing as a whole has seen serious turmoil across its defense and commercial sectors in recent years, including with regard to new Air Force One jets for the Air Force and other high-profile U.S. military programs, leading to billions of dollars in financial losses. How much the CERP program is expected to cost in total at this point is unclear, but there are indications that it may have already grown from around $8 billion to roughly $9 billion. Boeing was supposed to provide the Air Force with an updated cost estimate by the end of last year, but it is unclear whether or not that occured. CERP is also just one of a number of modernization efforts the Air Force is pursuing to help ensure its B-52s remain operationally relevant for decades to come. This includes a major Radar Modernization Program (RMP), which has also struggled with delays and cost growth in recent years. Replacing the B-52's existing mechanically-scanned AN/APQ-166 radar with a new active electronically-scanned array (AESA) type derived from Raytheon's popular AN/APG-79 is seen as a particularly critical upgrade. The new radars will offer greater range and fidelity, along with improved situational awareness and resistance to countermeasures. All of this could help with target acquisition and identification, including of potentially hostile aircraft, as well as help expand the aircraft's ability to employ networked munitions at long distances. The radars will also have secondary ground moving target indicator (GMTI) and synthetic aperture radar surveillance capabilities, and could have additional functionality, including electronic warfare and communications support. A rendering of what the final B-52J configuration might look like with the new F130 engines and other upgrades. Boeing via Air &#038; Space Forces Magazine The Air Force otherwise sees the B-52 as a key element of its nuclear and conventional long-range strike capabilities through at least 2050, including in a potential high-end fight against China in the Pacific. In addition to the on-aircraft upgrades, the bombers are set to receive new weapons to support those missions, including the nuclear-tipped AGM-181A Long Range Stand Off (LRSO) cruise missile and future conventionally-armed hypersonic weapons. Regardless, the re-engining program remains arguably the most important upgrade effort for the B-52 in decades, but it may ultimately take at least 15 years total to complete the work.

Balloon-Launched Drone To Intercept Long Range Kamikaze Drones Em...	Pictures have appeared on social media showing work in Ukraine to turn a tethered aerostat – what is more colloquially called a balloon – into an elevated platform for launching kamikaze drones at incoming long-range one-way attack drones. This follows the emergence last year of a sensor system designed to detect and locate enemy drone operators mounted on the same type of aerostat. The pictures of the balloon-based kamikaze drone launcher, seen in the post on X below, have been circulating online since earlier today. It is unclear to what degree the aerostat's manufacturer, Ukrainian startup Aerobavovna, is involved in this project, which is not mentioned on the company's website or its channel on the Telegram social media network at the time of writing. The aforementioned aerostat-mounted counter-drone sensor system was developed and rolled out by a separate Ukrainian firm, Kvertus. TWZ has reached out to Aerobavovna for more information. The Ukrainian company Aero Bavovna is developing an aerostat system to intercept Russian 'Shahed' UAVs.The balloon will carry an FPV fixed wing kamikaze ready to be dropped when a Shahed is detected by an infrared camera. pic.twitter.com/oyA9Dd511v&mdash; Roy (@GrandpaRoy2) March 12, 2025 From the images that emerged so far, the system as it currently exists includes a launcher for a single fixed-wing kamikaze drone 'interceptor,' as well as a sensor array suspended from the underside of the aerostat and other equipment. The system is designed to attempt an intercept 'after detecting long-range kamikaze UAVs [uncrewed aerial vehicles] via an IR [infrared] camera,' according to a machine translation of a post on the @infomil_live Telegram channel, but this is unconfirmed. Other details about the system, including what its full sensor suite consists of, what level of automation it has when it comes to detecting threats and/or attempting intercepts, and what roles any human operators play in its employment are unknown. In general, elevating any sensor system helps provide a better line-of-sight field of view toward the horizon and improved ‘look-down’ coverage. A higher perch provides similar benefits for signal relay and electronic warfare suites. Aerobavovna currently advertises its aerostats as suitable for surveillance, general communications, and acting as signal relays for first-person view (FPV) kamikaze drones. The use of aerostats and other lighter-than-air craft as elevated sensor nodes, and ones designed specifically to spot and track incoming threats, is hardly new. The U.S. Army's abortive Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System (JLENS) program is one of the best known examples. Other aerostat-based sensor systems have been and continue to be in service in the United States and other countries globally. The continued use of balloons for intelligence-gathering purposes was notably thrust back into the public consciousness after the shootdown of a Chinese spy balloon, as well as three still-unidentified objects, in and around U.S. and Canadian airspace in February 2023. A picture taken from the cockpit of a US Air Force U-2 spy plane of the Chinese spy balloon that was ultimately shot down in February 2023. USAF There has also been something of a resurgence in interest in using lighter-than-air platforms for early warning and general surveillance in recent years, including Poland's plan to deploy a line of aerostat-based Airspace and Surface Radar Reconnaissance (ARSS) systems. This has been driven in part by Russia's extensive use of both long-range one-way attack drones and cruise missiles – relatively small and low-flying threats that underscore the value of elevated ‘look-down’ sensor capabilities – in its ongoing war against Ukraine. Both sides in the conflict make regular use of various types of kamikaze drones, as well as ones capable of dropping small munitions, on and around the front lines, as well. As TWZ routinely points out, the threats posed by drones are not new and continue to grow in scale and scope, thanks now in part to advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, both on and off traditional battlefields around the world. The idea of using balloons, airships, and other lighter-than-air platforms to launch drones, small munitions, and other payloads, is also not new. TWZ previously published an in-depth feature on Chinese work on balloon-launched drone swarms, which also touched on similar U.S. military efforts, which you can find here. A graphic depicting, in broad strokes, a concept for deploying drones via high-altitude balloon and then using a satellite to relay information to a control node. Chinese Academy of Sciences via International Journal of Micro Air Vehicles The use of various types of drones to try to intercept other uncrewed threats, as well as helicopters, has also become a commonplace feature of the ongoing fighting in Ukraine.

It might also be possible to tie in the balloon-based systems with other Ukrainian counter-drone and air defense capabilities, such as the country's low-cost acoustic sensor network consisting of thousands of microphones to detect incoming drones. If the interceptor-armed aerostats are also relatively low cost and low footprint, they could be even more valuable for supplementing the Ukrainian military's other counter-drone capabilities and further reducing the strain on higher-end and prized air defense systems, especially those supplied by the West. Recent disruptions in U.S. military assistance have raised particular questions about Ukraine's air defense capabilities and overall capacity in the absence of such support. Much remains to be learned about the counter-drone interceptor system utilizing the Aerobavovna aerostat. Its appearance does underscore the continually expanding efforts in Ukraine to address the very serious threats posed by kamikaze drones on and off the front lines.

Machine Gun With Longer Reach Sought By U.S. Army	The U.S. Army is looking at acquiring a new machine gun chambered to fire the .338 Norma Magnum cartridge, but that can also be converted to use the same 6.8x51mm ammunition as its next-generation M7 rifles and M250 light machine guns. A machine gun in .338 Norma Magnum would give Army units mcuh greater reach than they can get now with their 7.62x51mm M240-series types. The service is eyeing conversion kits that would allow its existing M240Bs and M240Ls to fire the 6.8x51mm rounds, as well. The Army's Contracting Command-New Jersey at Picatinny Arsenal recently issued two separate contracting notices seeking information about potential options for a dual-caliber .338 Norma Magnum/6.8x51mm machine gun and M240B/L 6.8x51mm conversion kits. The Sig Sauer MG 338 seen in the video below is one .338 Norma Magnum machine gun on the market now. 'The dual caliber machine gun should include all hardware and instructions needed to operate as a .338 Norma Machine Gun and the conversion kit to fire the 6.8x51mm XM1186 general purpose cartridge,' the notice regarding that weapon states. 'Presently, the M240B and M240L machine guns are 7.62[x51]mm weapons. The durability, reliability, and function of the M240 weapon platform cannot be significantly compromised with a change in ammunition,' the conversion kit notice says. 'The conversion kit should include all hardware and instructions needed to modify a standard M240B and M240L to fire the 6.8mm XM1186 general purpose cartridge. This will include a new barrel assembly and may include changes to the weapon powering through updates to the gas regulator, drive spring, or other means. The barrel assembly must be the standard barrel length (M240B) and short barrel length (M240L).' M240s are the Army's current general purpose machine guns. The B model, with its roughly 24-inch long barrel and 27.6 pound unloaded weight, is the baseline type in the service's inventory today. The lighter weight L version, with its shorter barrel (just under 22 inches), collapsible stock, and titanium receiver, tips the scales at 21.8 pounds. The Army also has a M240H variant with spade grips instead of a buttstock for use as a helicopter door gun. An M240B machine gun with its top cover open and mounted on a tripod seen during training. US Army A member of the US Army fires an M240L. US Army The Army currently issues M240 variants for use by infantry and other dismounted personnel, as well as in vehicle and helicopter-mounted applications. M240s are also in widespread use elsewhere across the U.S. military in similar roles, as well as mounted on ships and small boats. An M240H mounted in the window of a US Army Black Hawk helicopter. US Army A pair of M240 machine guns in a mount on a US Navy special operations watercraft. USN The main benefit of acquiring a new machine gun in .338 Norma Magnum would be the additional range such a weapon would offer over 7.62x51mm M240s, as well as improved terminal effects on targets at those longer distances. .338 Norma Magnum has historically been more of a caliber option for sniper rifles. The Army's stated maximum effective range of an M240B against an area target is 1,312 yards (1,200 meters). That shrinks to around 875 yards (800 meters) when talking about engaging specific point targets, according to manufacturer FN. A .338 Norma Magnum machine gun could offer at least double the effective range, if not more, depending on the design and specific ammunition loadings. Being able to relatively readily convert any new machine gun to fire the 6.8x51mm round would also offer valuable ammunition commonality with the M7 rifle and the M250 light machine gun. 6.8x51mm ammunition is also lighter and cheaper per round than .338 Norma Magnum, which could be beneficial, especially for routine proficiency training on shorter ranges. The ability to convert M240B/Ls to fire 6.8x51mm would provide similar benefits to the Army. A member of the US Army fires an M250 machine gun during a cold weather evaluation of the weapon. US Army It is worth noting here that the U.S. special operations community, at times in cooperation with the U.S. Marine Corps, has been actively working toward adopting a .338 Norma Magnum machine gun for the better part of a decade now. U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) was reportedly expected to issue a formal request for proposals for what it has been (somewhat confusingly) calling a Light Machine Gun-Medium (LMG-M) by the end of last year, but it is unclear whether or not that occurred. A past SOCOM briefing slide regarding the LMG-M program. SOCOM SOCOM and Marines have already been evaluating multiple .338 Norma Magnum machine gun designs in recent years. This includes Sig Sauer's MG 338, the design of which is directly related to the M250 light machine gun that the company is already supplying to the Army. Sig Sauer is also the manufacturer of the M7 rifle. Sig Sauer has notably also shown a version of the MG 338 with spade grips for vehicle and helicopter-mounted applications, as well as an example of standard versions of the gun in a naval mounting, in recent years.

The RM338 began life at General Dynamics Ordnance & Tactical Systems as the Lightweight Medium Machine Gun (LWMMG). Talk about caliber conversions for existing M240s as a tangent to the Army's adoption of its new slate of 6.8x51mm guns is not new, either. Large-scale adoption of a dual-caliber .338 Norma Magnum/6.8x51mm by the Army could aid SOCOM in its ongoing push to field such a weapon and lead to its use elsewhere within the U.S. military and help spreading out of associated cost burdens. Similarly, M240s firing 6.8x51mm ammunition could see wider-spread use if the Army moves ahead with those plans. U.S. military small arms procurement trends often have global impacts, as well. The Army is already in the midst of a major small arms shift with its new M7 rifles and M250 light machine guns, and now a new general purpose machine gun may be closer on the horizon.

Ukraine On Verge Of Losing Key City In Russia’s Kursk Region	Seven months after Ukraine captured Sudzha in the surprise invasion of Russia's Kursk region, its hold on this key city appears to be nearing an end. While one Russian media outlet claims Sudzha has fallen, Ukrainian military sources we spoke with, as well as Russian and Ukrainian media and Telegram channels, say there is still fighting going on there, though the prospects for Ukraine keeping the city aren't good. The loss of Sudzha, located less than six miles from the border, would mark a major turning point because it sits along an important supply route and has served as a key staging area and command and control node for Ukraine’s forces. Its precarious status raises the question of just how much longer this incursion can last, as both Ukrainian and Russian sources say Moscow's troops have retaken several towns in Kursk over the past 24 hours. You can read more about the Russian effort to enter Sudzha through an abandoned gas pipeline in our recent story here. No one wants to see these videos of reality, when your own are getting killed, but this is the reality of war, our friends die also, not just Russians!

Ukrainian Armed Forces fighters have left the city. As we have learned, there is currently a small number of Ukrainian troops in the city, but they are all retreating. Some of them managed to take cover before the HIMARS MLRS shelling from the Sumy region, the rest were killed or wounded during the fighting.' The Kursk city of Sudzha is on the verge of recapture by Russia. (Google Earth) Ukrainian and Georgian sources tell us that the fighting in Sudzha is ongoing. 'Ukrainian troops have not yet retreated from Sudzha city,' a retired high-ranking Ukrainian officer told The War Zone Wednesday morning. 'Fighting is going on at the western and northern parts of the city right now.' 'There are still some Ukrainian troops there,' Mamuka Mamulashvili, commander of the Georgian Legion, told us. He estimated that Ukrainian forces still hold about a third of the roughly 500 square miles of Kursk they held at the peak of its invasion. However, an infographic from Voice of America, which you can see below, suggests Ukraine's salient is even smaller. Since Kyiv launched its cross-border assault into Russia's Kursk region last August, Moscow has been pushing back hard.

These statements come in the wake of a Telegram channel linked to Russian paratroopers claiming its forces have occupied at least the center of Sudzha.

While Ukraine was steadily losing territory there, the biggest push came last week after the U.S. cut off intelligence support and arms supplies to Ukraine following a White House blowout between Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump. Several sources told us that the move played a big role in Russia’s recent Kursk advances. The U.S. on Tuesday resumed providing Ukraine with intelligence products like satellite imagery as well as weaponry after the two nations agreed on a plan for a 30-day ceasefire. Maxar on Wednesday confirmed to us that they are once giving Ukraine access to its images.

Dutch Navy Fires First Tomahawk As Long-Range Strike Plans Take S...	For the first time, the Royal Netherlands Navy has launched a Tomahawk cruise missile from one of its De Zeven Provinciën class frigates. The test launch makes the Netherlands only the fourth country to have fired one of the weapons, which it’s adding to its inventory as part of a wider portfolio of long-range weapons acquired primarily in response to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The Dutch Ministry of Defense announced today that a Tomahawk was launched from the frigate HNLMS De Ruyter off the coast of Norfolk, Virginia, yesterday. Led by the U.S. Navy, the test launch was part of the process of the Dutch 'gathering necessary information' ahead of fielding the missile operationally aboard their frigates. Another view of the first launch of Tomahawk from the frigate HNLMS De Ruyter off the coast of Norfolk, Virginia, yesterday. Dutch Ministry of Defense 'The Tomahawk long-range weapons allow the Navy to take out (strategic) targets deep inland from the sea,' the Dutch Ministry of Defense said. 'Examples include command centers, anti-aircraft installations, and enemy units. The missiles have a range of more than 1,000 kilometers [621 miles]. The weapon gives the Royal Netherlands Navy additional combat power. This helps deter potential adversaries.' 'Strong deterrence requires strong weapons,' Dutch State Secretary for Defense Gijs Tuinman said today on X. 'De Ruyter launched a Tomahawk missile for the first time. An important step to give our navy the striking power it needs in a changing world.' The Dutch classify the De Zeven Provinciën class as air defense and command frigates. Four of these vessels spearhead the Royal Netherlands Navy, each of them being roughly 473 feet long, with a beam of 61 feet, and a displacement of around 6,600 tons, fully loaded. The lead ship of its class, the Royal Netherlands Navy frigate HNLMS De Zeven Provinciën transits the Atlantic Ocean during Exercise Formidable Shield on May 18, 2021. U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Nathan T. Beard/Released The primary armament of the warships comprises a 40-cell Mk 41 vertical launch system (VLS) for RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) and Standard Missile 2 Block IIIA (SM-2) air defense missiles, eight launchers for Harpoon anti-ship missiles, two twin launchers for Mk 46 torpedoes, a 127mm Oto Breda main gun, a pair of Goalkeeper close-in weapon systems, and a NH90 helicopter. The Tomahawk is compatible with the existing Mk 41 VLS. Previously, the Mk 41 was typically loaded with 32 SM-2 and 32 ESSM missiles (the latter type in quad packs), although it’s unclear how many Tomahawks will normally be loaded. The De Zeven Provinciën class frigate HNLMS Tromp fires an SM-2 missile. Dutch Ministry of Defense While the Dutch had previously almost purchased Tomahawks to add a long-range strike capability to its navy, the proposal was shelved until Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, when it became a high-priority program. The dramatic changes in the European security environment have also seen Dutch investments in other long-range strike weapons, as well as a new class of four conventionally powered submarines, which will also be armed with Tomahawks. You can read all about these boats here. ​ ​Naval Group has been selected by The Netherlands @Defensie for the Replacement Netherlands Submarine Capability project, based on the Barracuda family expeditionary submarines.@kon_marine pic.twitter.com/jzhs4xn2lg&mdash; Naval Group (@navalgroup) March 15, 2024 Yesterday’s test involved the Block IV Tomahawk, which can actually hit targets almost 1,000 miles away with a 1,000-pound unitary warhead. It can be rerouted mid-flight and can loiter over an area to hit targets as they emerge, featuring an imaging infrared seeker capability. In April 2023, the Dutch Ministry of Defense announced plans to overhaul the country’s long-range conventional strike capabilities. As the then Dutch State Secretary for Defense Christophe van der Maat explained at the time: 'The war in Ukraine shows once again that fire support over short, medium, and long distances is essential. This applies on land, from the air, and from the sea. With the new systems, Defense further fleshes out NATO’s joint combat power and deterrence. The Netherlands is thus showing that it takes responsibility by making a strong contribution to this. Moreover, with this, the Netherlands meets the desire to possess its own missile artillery and long-range weaponry, as outlined in the 2022 Defense White Paper.' The Royal Netherlands Air Force is receiving the conventionally armed AGM-158B Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range, or JASSM-ER, for its fleet of F-35A stealth fighters, which are now also nuclear-capable. JASSM-ER can strike well-defended targets at a range of around 600 miles. An artist’s impression of a Dutch F-35A carrying JASSM-ER weapons. Dutch Ministry of Defense Meanwhile, the Royal Netherlands Army will operate the Israeli-made PULS (Precise and Universal Launch System) multiple rocket launcher. PULS has a range of up to 186 miles, according to the manufacturer. Interestingly, the Dutch are getting these long-range weapons from different sources rather than just from the United States. Indeed, the PULS was chosen over the rival U.S.-made HIMARS. The Dutch Ministry of Defense said that PULS was selected because it can carry more rockets, better fits within the country’s budget, and will likely be more suitable for European-made ammunition. The decision to procure Israeli rocket artillery (and, to a lesser extent, French-made submarines, in which case there are currently no U.S.-made alternatives) was made before the current questions about America’s future support for NATO under President Donald Trump. In recent days, media outlets across Europe have suggested that this changing dynamic could place the F-35, in particular, at risk, with talk of a possible ‘kill switch’ that could simply take these stealth fighters offline if Washington so desired. The reality of that matter is somewhat different, as TWZ has discussed, but it’s notable that the Dutch Ministry of Defense, too, has taken the decision to clarify its position as regards the F-35. 'It’s in the interest of all of us to make sure that the F-35 program remains operational, that it remains as successful as it is right now, and I don’t see any signs of the United States backtracking,' Dutch Minister of Defense Ruben Brekelmans told reporters yesterday, in comments reported by Defense News. The Netherlands has ordered 52 F-35s and, last September, announced plans to buy another six more. A Dutch F-35A brandishing AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles during a NATO air policing drill. Bartek Bera Brekelmans added that the United States is 'biggest partner, and we need to have them on board in order to have a successful F-35 program, but other countries also play a key role,' pointing out that the Joint Strike Fighter also contains 'essential parts that only we produce.' At the same time, Brekelmans said he was cognizant of the changing security situation in Europe vis-à-vis the United States’ security guarantees and broader vision for NATO. Brekelmans said that it was understandable that the United States now expected European allies to 'do much more' in terms of defense. 'They do not expect burden sharing, they do expect burden shifting,' Brekelmans said. 'We should take that message seriously, but we should not speculate on any further steps that the United States is taking because we simply cannot guarantee our security without the U.S. at this moment. That is the reality that we have to work with.' Interestingly, Brekelmans also noted that 'it’s very good' that French President Emmanuel Macron raised the idea last week of extending the umbrella of its independent nuclear deterrent farther across Europe. This echoes calls from German leader-in-waiting Friedrich Merz for talks with France and the United Kingdom about European 'nuclear sharing or at least nuclear security.' You can read more about this topic here. Whatever the future of nuclear deterrence in Europe might look like, the Dutch are already part of the ‘dual-key’ arrangement that still provides U.S.-supplied B61 nuclear bombs for use by NATO air arms in Europe. At the same time, its conventional strike capabilities are also being boosted considerably, with yesterday’s test of a Tomahawk cruise missile the latest expression of a new-look defense posture in the Netherlands that is also seeing a return to main battle tanks, after the last of these were withdrawn in 2011, and additional air defense systems. All of this investment is expensive, of course, and the Dutch government is now looking at increasing defense spending above two percent of its GDP. Much of this would have been unthinkable just three years ago, a reflection of the degree to which Russia’s all-out invasion of Ukraine has reshaped the geopolitical landscape in Europe since then.

Green Berets Looking For FPV Drones To Help Them Clear Hostile Ca...	The command overseeing U.S. special operations forces in the Middle East wants to buy an unspecified number of first-person view (FPV) drones and associated training to help Green Berets clear caves. U.S. Special Operations Command Central (SOCCENT) is seeking these weapons to augment the use of military working dogs (MWDs) because it considers drones safer and more effective. The concern is of increasing relevance as Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and Iran have all utilized caves, tunnels and other underground facilities as attack vectors, weapons and personnel hiding facilities and command and control nodes. 'Currently, the absence of dedicated unmanned aerial systems (UAS) for cave clearing operations forces reliance on Military Working Dogs (MWD) or partner forces, significantly increasing risk to both personnel and mission success,' U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) wrote in a request for a single-source FPV drone contract for SOCCENT posted on the SAM.gov U.S. purchasing portal. 'Caves present confined, complex spaces with limited visibility and unpredictable terrain, increasing the danger to personnel and potentially hindering MWD effectiveness.' SOCOM is looking for FPV drones for cave warfare because it considers them safer and more effective than Military Working Dogs. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images) In its justification for the single-source procurement, SOCOM notes that the fast and highly maneuverable FPV drones would provide real-time visual intelligence from inside caves, reducing the risk of having troops inside them when much of the mission can be accomplished by a drone. In addition, FPV drones with communications relays 'enhance coordination between teams inside and outside the cave, facilitating smoother operations and faster response times.' Operating drones underground, in confined spaces with no line-of-sight, is a challenge the U.S. military has been working to overcome for years. While the request doesn’t specify what kind of FPV drones are required, SOCOM could very well be looking for a number of options, including those guided by a fiber optic cable, given the difficulties of operating in these areas. Both Ukraine and Russia have been increasingly using hard-wired fiber optics for control links because the connection cannot be jammed by electronic warfare equipment but also because the link isn't degraded when flying low over the ground or amongst obstacles and terrain since there is no line-of-sight connectivity requirements. This allows them to maneuver with full picture and control fidelity inside of buildings and tunnels.

The introduction to AI will also allow even small drones to be able to navigate at least partially on their own, which could help significantly for operating in tunnels and other areas where the connection can be spotty at best. Drones with spherical cages around them and other unique alterations also allow them to fly more freely in tight spaces without clipping their propellers. SWAT and other police units have pioneered the use of drones in such circumstances. In addition to seeking the hardware, SOCOM also wants SOF operators to be trained how to use them, considering how much work it takes to fly them effectively. You can read about how the Ukrainians, leaders in FPV drone innovations, have trained on them in our story here. SOCOM redacted the cost of the request but said the 'investment will significantly improve the safety and efficiency of cave clearing operations, ultimately contributing to mission success and force protection.' The funding will come from the command’s Fiscal Year 2025 Operations and Maintenance (O&M) account. We’ve reached out to the command for more details and will update this story with any pertinent information provided. Part of SOCOM's justification for seeking a single-source contract for FPV drones. (SOCOM) The command’s pitch has redacted the specific location where the drones would be used and the exact unit that would operate them. However, it does state that they would be operated by ODAs - Operational Detachment Alphas, or A-Teams, the basic building block of the U.S. Army’s Green Berets. The request also notes that the redacted unit 'has limited UAS capabilities and is reliant upon external agencies to provide specialized assets. The equipment enables ODAs to gain a visual on the risks present on an obscured objective, prior to engagement. Without this capability, ODAs accept undue risk to the force by entering an objective without detect and defeat capabilities.' U.S. special operations forces are increasingly being trained to operate underground. (U.S. Air Force photo by Staff Sgt. Rose Gudex) Staff Sgt. Rose Gudex Green Berets have already been training with FPV drones largely based on lessons learned in Ukraine. Last year, the Army announced it had hired private contractor Flymotion to provide drone and non-standard vehicle training services to a Green Beret A Team from the 2nd Battalion of the 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne), or 10th SFG(A), out of Fort Carson, Colorado. Since Flymotion received a sole-source deal, Army officials had to provide detailed justifications for not using typical competition contracting processes. That is the type of process SOCOM is seeking for the FPV drones. You can read more about Green Beret FPV drone training in our in-depth story here. A US Army Green Beret operates a first-person view FPV drone during an exercise in Greece in 2024. (SOCEUR) SOCEUR Though SOCOM has redacted the area where these drones will operate, given that the request is being made on behalf of SOCCENT, it most likely involves operations in the U.S. Central Command Area of Operations (AOR). That covers 21 nations in the Middle East and Central Asia, including Afghanistan, Israel, Syria, Lebanon, Iran, Iraq, and Yemen. During the so-called war on terror, U.S. and allied troops frequently found themselves battling the Taliban, ISIS and other jihadi group in caves. Weaponized FPV drones, which were not in use back then, would be beneficial in any future U.S. SOF underground operation in that region.

US special operations forces during training. (DoD) www.twz.com Israel has gained extensive experience in cave and tunnel fighting against Hamas and Hezbollah. Beyond Gaza and Lebanon, Israel also carried out a raid against an Iranian underground missile facility. That raid served as a warning to Iran that its underground facilities were not invincible. You can read more about that mission here. IDF special operations training for hostage rescue in dense urban environments. (IDF) The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have used FPV drones in Gaza mostly to 'survey buildings and underground tunnels, given that this is the most precise method of navigating such spaces,' the Institute for National and Strategic Studies (INSS) noted last year in a report on FPV drone usage. At the time, however, it was 'unknown whether there has been any additional IDF procurement of drones, whether they have been deployed more widely and whether troops have been specially trained in their use for intelligence gathering or attacks, even though the IDF makes widespread use of other kinds of drones,' INSS posited. However, the Israeli Ministry of Defense Department of Production and Procurement wants to procure thousands of FPV drones from Israeli companies for a wide range of offensive purposes, according to the Israeli Globes media outlet. The initial solicitation called for 5,000 FPV drones, but that could expand to 20,000, the publication noted. So far, about 25 Israeli drone suppliers that work with the Ministry of Defense have registered for the tender. As for SOCOM, the command says only one company is capable of providing the FPV drones and training required. 'After conducting market research and a comprehensive and thorough review of available options,' SOCOM said that it has selected the vendor, but that company’s name is redacted in the SAMs request, which does not state a specific timeline for fulfillment. Though SOCOM is concerned about the risk of continued reliance on MWDs, it must be noted that no drone has the keen senses of sight and smell like that of a highly trained dog. These animals have frequently accompanied SOF teams on missions, including the 2019 raid that killed then-ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi in his Syrian compound. Al-Baghdadi died after running into a dead-end tunnel with three children, chased by an MWD later identified as Conan. The ISIS leader detonated a suicide vest, killing himself and the three children, collapsing the tunnel and injuring Conan.

Scyrrus Corregidor) However, American forces are still lagging behind in many ways when it comes to the ubiquity of FPV drones on the battlefield, regardless of the domain. That SOCOM wants to purchase them, as well as the training it will take to make operators proficient, is another way U.S. special operations forces are working to close that gap.

You Don’t Need A Kill Switch To Hobble Exported F-35s	In response to recent European media reports, Lockheed Martin and several governments have pushed back on the idea that F-35 Joint Strike Fighters have any kind of a discreet 'kill switch' that U.S. authorities could use to remotely disable the jets. The stark reality is that a dedicated kill switch is not needed to keep foreign F-35s from being able to perform what they were designed to do. Just cutting off support to the jets would accomplish the same result, albeit maybe not instantly, but soon enough. Without access to American-controlled maintenance and logistics chains, as well as computer networks, any F-35 fleet would quickly start to become unusable and any jets that remain flying for a truncated period of time would only be able to do so with massively degraded capabilities. Members of the US Air Force perform maintenance on a pair of F-35As. USAF Claims that the Joint Strike Fighter has a remote disabling feature are not new, but have resurfaced following the U.S. government's abrupt decision to cut off military aid and intelligence assistance to Ukraine and new questions about America's support for NATO under President Donald Trump. Outlets across Europe, including in Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, and the United Kingdom, have published stories touching at least in part on the possibility of an F-35 'kill switch' in the past week or so. This, in turn, has prompted several official responses. 'We have no indication that this is possible,' Belgian Chief of Defence Gen. Frederik Vansina told that country's newspaper La Dernière Heure on March 5. 'The F-35 is not a remote-controlled aircraft. The program relies on worldwide logistical support, with spare parts circulating between user countries.' : A worthy milestone Last month, Belgium's first F-35A Lightning II arrived at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona.This milestone marks the beginning of Belgium’s transition from the F-16 Fighting Falcon to the advanced F-35A Lightning II. pic.twitter.com/QZzU4kQSXH&mdash; F-35 Lightning II Joint Program Office (@theF35JPO) January 16, 2025 'It is not possible to 'remotely control' or 'block' the F-35A fighter jets, for example by external intervention in the electronics,' according to a machine translation of a press release dated March 7 from the Swiss Department of Federal Defense. 'Switzerland does not need consent if it wants to use its weapons systems or guided missiles for its own defense. It can do this autonomously, independently, and at any time.' On March 8, manufacturer Lockheed Martin sent out an Email to TWZ and others about 'rumors circulating that the F-35 has a 'kill switch' that the U.S. can activate to disable allied F-35 fleets' that pointed to the earlier rebuttals from Swiss and Belgian authorities. A US Air Force F-35A Joint Strike in Switzerland in 2019. USAF To reiterate, there is no evidence to date that F-35s in service anywhere feature some kind of dedicated capability that can be used to fully disable the jets at the literal or figurative touch of a button. What is true is that Joint Strike Fighters are subject to particularly significant U.S. export and other governmental controls. Virtually all F-35s in service worldwide are dependent in critical ways on proprietary support from the U.S. government and contractors in the United States. 'You don't need a 'kill switch' to severely hamper the utility of an exported weapons system, you just stop providing support for it and it will wither away, some systems very quickly,' TWZ's own Tyler Rogoway wrote on X yesterday. 'The more advanced the faster the degradation.' 'The F-35 was conceived, developed, and continues to be operated and sustained as a joint/coalition platform, built on strong partnerships with U.S. allies and partner nations across the globe. From its inception, the F-35 has been a collaborative effort, integrating the expertise and contributions of multiple countries to ensure it meets the operational needs of all its users,' a spokesperson for the F-35 JPO told TWZ yesterday in response to questions about U.S. authorities and procedures for disconnecting parties from aspects of the Joint Strike Fighter program. 'The program operates under well-established agreements that ensure all F-35 operators have the necessary capabilities to sustain and operate their aircraft effectively. The strength of the F-35 program lies in its global partnership, and we remain committed to providing all users with the full functionality and support they require.' A graphic offering a sense of the still very U.S.-centric F-35 global supply chain as of 2018. Turkish companies are notably no longer involved in the F-35 program. Lockheed Martin What the JPO statement doesn't explicitly mention is that, by retaining key data rights, Lockheed Martin, and to a lesser extent Pratt & Whitney, which supplies the F135 engines that power all Joint Strike Fighter variants, exercise substantial control on almost all aspects of sustaining the F-35. This includes imposing limits on what maintenance work can be done outside of contractor-operated facilities in the United States and other select countries. Many individual components on the jets, especially its 'black boxes' that contain critical electronics, are sealed for export control reasons and have to be sent back to designated facilities for maintenance. There is no knowledge base whatsoever to do so in the user's country. Even functioning as intended under peacetime conditions, the F-35 sustainment chains that exist now have had significant trouble keeping F-35s, including those in service with the U.S. military, operational. American officials have expressed fears in recent years that the current mechanisms for sourcing spare parts, a regular shortages thereof, in particular, would present major operational risks in any future large-scale conflict. A lack of key spares is one of the most commonly cited contributing factors to the historically low available rates for all variants of the F-35 in U.S. service. You can read more about F-35 maintenance and logistics issues in detail in this past TWZ feature. This reinforces just how quickly the situation would deteriorate for any Joint Strike Fighter operator who might suddenly find themselves on their own without access to the tightly controlled global parts and support ecosystem. Trying to get F-35 spare parts from alternative legitimate or 'gray' sources, or even via smuggling, would be extremely difficult if not impossible given the overall complexity of the jets and the very high tolerances of even the smallest components. Maintaining the Joint Strike Fighters' critically important low-observable (stealthy) skins notably requires specialized facilities and equipment. Robotic systems apply a corrosion-resistant coating to a U.S. Air Force F-35A Joint Strike Fighter. USAF The still highly classified nature of much of the F-35 program would only make all of this more complicated, including the tight controls put in place on individual aircraft components. Further, 'There’s certain F-35 Special Access Programs [SAP] that now our [NATO] partners are read into and they know about,' U.S. Air Force Gen. James Hecker said just last year, underscoring the level of secrecy that still exists around many elements of the Joint Strike Fighter. A pair of US Air Force F-35s fly together with two more Joint Strike Fighters from NATO ally the Netherlands. USAF SAPs provide additional heavily compartmented layers of security protocols for information that U.S. officials deem especially sensitive to national security, as you can read more about here. Hecker, who was and still is head of U.S. Air Forces in Europe and Air Forces Africa (USAFE-AFAFRICA), as well as NATO’s Allied Air Command, was speaking during a virtual talk hosted by the Air & Space Forces Association’s (AFA) Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies in August 2024. Even if an F-35 operator disconnected from the larger Joint Strike Fighter program's supply chains can keep some number of its jets flying for a period of time through spares on hand and cannibalization, those aircraft would have extremely degraded capabilities. This is in large part due to the long-troubled Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) and its successor, the Operational Data Integrated Network (ODIN), which is still in the process of being fielded. ALIS/ODIN is a cloud-based network that is responsible for much more than just managing F-35 logistics, although that too is a critical part of keeping the aircraft flying as it talks directly to the supply and servicing networks discussed above. The system also serves as the port through which data packages containing highly sensitive mission planning information, including details about enemy air defenses and other intelligence, are developed and loaded onto Joint Strike Fighters before sorties as Mission Data Files (MDFs). It's this mission planning data package that is a major factor to the F-35's survivability. The 'blue line' (the aircraft's route into an enemy area) that is projected by the system is based on the fusion of a huge number of factors, from enemy air defense bubbles to the stealth and electronic warfare capabilities of the aircraft, as well as onboard sensor and weapons employment envelopes and integrated tactics between F-35s and other assets. To say the least, it is one of the F-35's most potent weapons. Without it, the aircraft and its pilot are far less capable of maximizing their potential and, as a result, are more vulnerable to detection and being shot down. When the jets return to base afterward, it is also the means by which intelligence and other data collected during the mission is downloaded for further analysis and exploitation. This information is mined for additional intelligence value and it can be used to update critical threat libraries that enable the F-35's survivability. You can read more about the F-35's electronic intelligence collection capabilities here and the importance of the ALIS/ODIN network here. for the fusion engine that IDs targets with minimal emissions. It contains threat emitter models that permit the aircraft to follow the minimum-detectability flightpath, the 'blue line' track. It runs comms, hosts the electronic order of battle./2&mdash; Bill Sweetman (@ValkStrategy) March 10, 2025 The MDFs themselves are processed through ALIS/ODIN and rely on work done in facilities located in the United States that are governed by U.S. policy. The F-35 Partner Support Complex (PSC) 'provides the capability to program, test and field F-35 Mission Data for Partner Nation and FMS [Foreign Military Sales] customers,' according to the official Air Force page on this civilian led unit, which is part of the service's 350th Spectrum Warfare Group. 'This activity is 100% funded by the supported nations, including: United Kingdom, Australia, Norway, Italy, Denmark, Netherlands, Japan, Korea, Israel, Poland and Belgium. These nations are not allowed to conduct independent test operations outside of the CONUS [continental United States] based on U.S. policy.' In the past TWZ has highlighted the potential danger of ALIS/ODIN being a vector for cyber attacks that could feed bad information into the network, or even disrupt or disable certain aspects of F-35 operations. Several countries have worked over the years to establish firewalls to protect sovereign data within the network, at least to a degree, underscoring the real concerns about its heavily centralized design. The idea that the U.S. could command a similar tactic if it wants to ground a country's F-35s is interesting to ponder, but doing so would be in breach of contract and it could have dangerous implications on many levels, including to the rest of the F-35 fleet, if it is feasible. How important is it? UK originally asked for its own reprogramming lab. Formal request renewed in 2006. US definitively refused in 2009, judging that partners were committed and would assume that US would always act in good faith./4&mdash; Bill Sweetman (@ValkStrategy) March 10, 2025 If a country were to be disconnected from the F-35 program, American authorities might also move to block its access to other critical services like space-based communications networks. Without beyond-line-of-sight communications systems and datalinks, and the networks underpinning them, Joint Strike Fighters would suffer even greater negative operational impacts. 'On F-35 fears, I get it – there is real dependency,' Senior Research Fellow for Airpower and Military Technology at the (RUSI) think tank in the United Kingdom, wrote on X yesterday. 'But if all your targeting capacity, BLOS [beyond-line-of-sight] comms, penetrating/orbital ISR [intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance] and the munitions you assume you’d fight with in a war are U.S.-provided; then dependency on the U.S. for MDFs [Mission Data Files] and ALIS/ODIN for F-35 isn’t your main problem.' On F-35 fears, I get it - there is real dependency.But if all your targeting capacity, BLOS comms, penetrating/orbital ISR and the munitions you assume you’d fight with in a war are US-provided; then dependency on the US for MDFs and ALIS/ODIN for F-35 isn’t your main problem.&mdash; Justin Bronk (@Justin_Br0nk) March 10, 2025 The Israel Defense Forces (IDF), rightly seeing the pitfalls of these critical and heavily intertwined dependencies, is the only F-35 operator to date have negotiated a deal that allows it to operate its jets outside of the ALIS/ODIN network, to install domestically-developed software suites onto the aircraft, and to conduct entirely independent depot-level maintenance. As such, the Israeli F-35I, a subvariant of the F-35A model, is unlike any other Joint Strike Fighter in service elsewhere in the world. The Israelis do still need to source spare parts externally, although they appear to have supplemental access to these resources. A one-of-a-kind F-35I test jet that the Israeli Air Force uses to support its already unique Joint Strike Fighter force. Israeli Air Force/Amit Agronov This all, in turn, speaks to serious broader downstream impacts a country would face in losing access to existing or future F-35 fleets. The Joint Strike Fighter offers a capable and survivable air combat platform with powerful intelligence-gathering, electronic warfare, and networking suites unlike any other currently in large-scale production. Work continues to be done to add new U.S. and foreign-made weapons to the jet's arsenal, as well as expand its ability to serve as a flying 'quarterback' for future loyal wingman-type drones. A new radar, improved electronic warfare capabilities, and more, are also on the horizon as part of the Block 4 upgrade package. For a number of America's NATO allies, continued participation in the alliance's nuclear weapon sharing agreements is also directly tied to the F-35. The nuclear mission played a particularly key role in Germany's decision to acquire Joint Strike Fighters. However, this is not really relevant in the context of a country losing access to the F-35 program since the nuclear bombs in question would only ever be released from U.S. custody right before their approved use. As it stands now, Lockheed Martin expects there to be around 600 F-35s, if not more, based just in Europe by 2035. Greece became the latest country to announce plans to buy the jets last year. The market for Joint Strike Fighters has continued to grow globally in recent years, too. 'There is no real replacement for the F-35. You would be sacrificing capability and survivability by stepping away from it. There is a whole ecosystem of capabilities provided beyond just the F-35 aircraft that would need to be established,' TWZ's Tyler Rogoway added in his thread on X yesterday. 'So major investment would be needed and force structure alterations. Unmanned capabilities and future indigenous fighter programs can solve the capability gap potentially, but this is not in the near term. Stepping away from F-35 isn't about just getting another fighter.' So major investment would be needed and force structure alterations. Unmanned capabilities and future indigenous fighter programs can solve the capability gap potentially, but this is not in the near term. Stepping away from F-35 isn't about just getting another fighter.&mdash; Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) March 10, 2025 For the United Kingdom, 'a credible plan B force' that doesn't include in F-35 'would take a decade and vast investment to generate,' RUSI Bronk also wrote on X. 'Uncomfortable but true. Not saying it shouldn’t or can’t be done, but we need a thorough capability audit and honesty about the results as a first step.' The United Kingdom is in the process of developing a next-generation stealth fighter, currently called the Tempest, in cooperation with Japan and Italy, both of which are also F-35 operators. Tempest is still years, if not decades away from becoming a reality. France, Germany, and Spain are also pursuing a similar effort with a more aggressive, but still multi-year schedule. Just developing a stealth combat jet has historically proven to be a complex and costly affair, with actually getting such an aircraft into serial production presenting additional challenges. The prospect of American authorities deciding to eject a country entirely from the F-35 program even after it has committed to buying the jets is not idle speculation, either. The U.S. government, with support from other program partners, decided to boot out Turkey in 2019 primarily over that country's purchase of Russian-made S-400 surface-to-air missile systems. The Turkish Air Force was blocked from taking delivery of F-35As, as well as various parts and other ancillary equipment, that had already been paid for. Turkish companies that had been major Joint Strike Fighter subcontractors for years were also unwound from the global supply network. There continue to be negotiations between the United States and Turkey about letting the latter back into the F-35 program. However, Turkey has also been pushing ahead with work on a domestically-developed stealth fighter, now named Kaan, which flew for the first time last year. It is important to point out that, while the F-35 is a particularly good example of issues around foreign dependencies, many of them are not limited to the Joint Strike Fighter program. This especially so after decades of defense industry consolidation in the United States and Europe. Having to rely on a small number of sources, if not a single one, to support weapons and other systems, including networking architecture, especially tightly controlled ones like a stealth fighter, is not at all uncommon. The more advanced a system is, the faster it is likely to degrade without support that is also less likely to be truly independent of foreign sources. Some countries have taken steps to try to retain as much materiel independence as possible, with long-neutral Sweden, which is now a NATO member, being perhaps the best known example. 'Switzerland strives to achieve the greatest possible operational, technical, and logistical autonomy when procuring its weapons systems,' the Swiss Department of Federal Defense's rebuttal to the recent 'kill switch' reports notes. 'However, complete independence from foreign manufacturers would only be possible if the systems and their components were developed entirely in Switzerland. This is neither the case today nor is it a realistic or economically viable scenario for the future.' For many countries in Europe, especially, interdependent defense contractor relationships with the United States often go both ways. 'We cannot ignore the level to which some of our major industries are now embedded in the U.S. and U.S. programmes – so some of the dependency is a two way street,' Greg Bagwell, President of the U.K. Air & Space Power Association and Distinguished Fellow at RUSI, as well as former Royal Air Force officer, wrote in a thread on the 'kill switch' issue on X yesterday. 'For example, BAES [U.K.-headquartered BAE Systems] gets 42% revenue from the U.S., and only 26% from the U.K. (2023 figures).' 7/ And we cannot ignore the level to which some of our major industries are now embedded in the US and US programmes - so some of the dependency is a two way street. For example, BAES gets 42% revenue from the US, and only 26% from the UK (2023 figures). pic.twitter.com/Pckosy0mEA&mdash; Greg Bagwell (@gregbagwell) March 10, 2025 While the F-35 might not have an explicit 'kill switch' feature, the program down to its very core, at least currently, creates significant and historically worrisome dependencies for the majority of Joint Strike Fighter operators. The aircraft requires constant support from a supply chain and just-in-time logistics concept that already has raised massive concerns. So many of its key features being tied to ALIS/ODIN only exacerbate these concerns. But really, the F-35 is just the proverbial canary in the geopolitical coal mine. With the current trajectory of U.S. government policy toward Ukraine and NATO, real worries about future support for American-made systems are only likely to grow, and there is a real possibility that U.S. arms exports to Europe could shrink as a result.

Space Force Chief 'Enamored By Systems That Deny, Disrupt, And De...	The U.S. Space Force’s top officer has provided an unusually detailed description of a vision for future counter-space capabilities and priorities in that regard — as well as the kinds of threats that the service faces. Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman’s comments came during the Air & Space Forces Association’s 2025 Warfare Symposium last week. Saltzman began by categorizing the types of adversary weapons that the United States might expect to encounter in space. These are broken down into six broad categories, three that are space-based and three that are ground-based, but with the same threats in each set. In each of those domains, the three broad threats are directed-energy weapons, such as lasers, radio-frequency capabilities, including electronic warfare jamming, and kinetic threats, which attempt to destroy a target physically. U.S. Space Force Chief of Space Operations speaks during a keynote address at the Air and Space Forces Association Warfare Symposium in Aurora, Colorado, on March 3, 2025. U.S. Air Force photo by Staff Sgt. Emmeline James Staff Sgt. Emmeline James The latter category includes 'killer satellites' positioned in orbit. As TWZ has explained in the past: 'A killer satellite able to maneuver close to its target could use various means to try to disable, damage, or even destroy it, such as jammers, directed energy weapons, robotic arms, chemical sprays, and small projectiles. It could even deliberately smash into the other satellite in a kinetic attack.' 'We’re seeing in our adversary developmental capabilities that they’re pursuing all of those,' Saltzman said. As for the United States, 'we’re not pursuing all of those yet,' Saltzman admitted, although he noted that there are 'good reasons to have all those categories.' A graphic from the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) provides methods that one satellite can use to attack another after it has been able to get in close proximity: DIA In particular, a broad range of capabilities is required to potentially counter a proliferation of satellites across low-Earth orbit, as well as in medium/high geo-synchronous orbit. These different challenges, Saltzman observed, 'require different kinds of capabilities. That which is effective in low-Earth orbit is less effective in GEO and vice versa.' A graphic depicting the major different orbits around our planet, from low-Earth orbit (LEO), via medium-Earth orbit (MEO), to geostationary orbit (GEO). Sedrubal via Wikimedia Commons In terms of the kind of threats that the United States and its allies now have to deal with in space, Saltzman considers that the most concerning aspect 'is the mix of weapons … they are pursuing the broadest mix of weapons, which means they’re going to hold a vast array of targets at risk.' In this context, Saltzman identifies China as the most dangerous adversary, although Russia is also working on similar capabilities. Back in 2021, Gen. David Thompson, at that time the Space Force’s second in command, pointed out that China and Russia were already launching 'reversible attacks,' meaning ones that don’t permanently damage the satellites. These attacks include jamming, temporarily blinding optics with lasers, and cyber-attacks, and they target U.S. satellites 'every single day.' Thompson also disclosed that a small Russian satellite used to conduct an on-orbit anti-satellite weapon test back in 2019 had at one point approached so close to a U.S. satellite that there were fears an actual attack was imminent. Even before then, U.S. satellites were coming under 'reversible attack.' A graphic giving a general overview of different kinds of anti-satellite electronic warfare jamming, which fall in the category of 'reversible attacks.' DIA In 2006, for example, the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) confirmed that a U.S. spy satellite had been 'illuminated' by a ground-based Chinese laser. On that occasion, it was a test with no impact on the satellite’s intelligence-gathering capabilities. Since then, however, there has been an uptick in these kinds of attacks, underscoring the rapid development and fielding by Russia and China of a wide variety of anti-satellite capabilities. As for non-reversible attacks, details in this regard are few and far between. In the past, when U.S. officials have been asked to confirm or deny whether any American satellites have actually been damaged in a Russian or Chinese attack, this information has been withheld as classified. A Defense Intelligence Agency graphic showing a full spectrum of potential attack types in space, ranging from the reversible to the nonreversible. DIA Nevertheless, with these various threats in mind, 'the focus out of the gate has been on the resiliency of our architecture, to make the targeting as hard on the adversary as possible,' Saltzman said last week. 'If you can disaggregate your missions from few satellites to many satellites, you change the targeting [requirements]. If you can make things maneuverable, it’s harder to target, and so that is an initial effort that we’ve invested heavily over the last few years to make us more resilient against those broad categories.' As well as efforts to field 'many satellites,' the U.S. military has been looking to develop and field new and improved space-based capabilities, as well as explore new concepts, such as distributed constellations of smaller satellites and ways to rapidly deploy new systems into orbit, to help reduce vulnerabilities to anti-satellite attacks, in general. This kind of resilience is only becoming more critical as the United States and its allies increasingly rely on space-based assets for vital capabilities, including early warning, intelligence-gathering, navigation and weapon guidance, communications and data-sharing, to name just a few. Of course, while Saltzman’s broad description of these six types of threats was framed around building resilience in space, the very same capabilities can be used, in turn, by the United States against its adversaries. Typically, Space Force officials are extremely tight-lipped about these so-called 'counter-space' capabilities. 'In the military setting, you don’t say, ‘Hey, here’s all the weapons and here’s how I’m going to use them, so get ready.’ That’s not to our advantage,' Saltzman said. While unable to talk specifics, The Space Force’s top officer did approach the topic more generally. 'I am far more enamored by systems that deny, disrupt, and degrade,' he said, as opposed to ones that destroy. 'I think there’s a lot of room to leverage systems focused on those D-words, if you will.' Saltzman pointed out that although systems that ‘destroy’ come at a cost in terms of debris, 'we may get pushed into a corner where we need to execute some of those options.' A painting commissioned for the U.S. Space Force depicts a fictitious reusable spaceplace intercepting a hostile ‘killer satellite’ threatening another American asset in orbit. U.S. Space Force Mainly, however, Saltzman’s Space Force is 'really focused on the weapons that deny, disrupt, and degrade. Those can have tremendous mission impacts with far less degradation, in a way that could affect blue systems. That’s just one of the things about the space environment. I tell my air-breathing friends all the time, when you shoot an airplane down, it falls out of your domain.' For the Space Force, using a weapon to destroy a target in space can lead to its own systems being threatened by debris. Saltzman pointed to the examples of the 2007 Chinese anti-satellite test and another by Russia in 2021 as 'still causing problems' in terms of hazardous debris. The 2021 Russian anti-satellite weapon test, in particular, involving a ground-launched interceptor, led to widespread condemnation, including from the U.S. government, and prompted renewed discussion about potential future conflicts in space. The video below shows a past test of Russia’s A-235 Nudol, a ballistic missile interceptor with anti-satellite capabilities: This is not the first time that a Space Force or Air Force senior officer has alluded to these kinds of capabilities, but such instances are vanishingly rare. 'There may come a point where we demonstrate some of our capabilities so that our adversaries understand they cannot deny us the use of space without consequence,' then-Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson said back in 2019. 'That capability needs to be one that’s understood by your adversary,' she added. 'They need to know there are certain things we can do, at least at some broad level, and the final element of deterrence is uncertainty. How confident are they that they know everything we can do? Because there’s a risk calculation in the mind of an adversary.' It’s worth noting, too, that the Biden administration vowed to halt U.S. destructive direct ascent anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons testing back in 2022, raising concerns about America’s ability to target enemy satellites, something you can read more about here. In recent years, American officials have increasingly pointed to the policy and other problems caused by the extreme secrecy that surrounds U.S. military activities, as well as those conducted by the U.S. Intelligence Community, outside the Earth’s atmosphere. Barbara Barrett, Wilson’s successor as Secretary of the Air Force, previously argued that 'The lack of an understanding really does hurt us in doing things that we need to do in space.' Meanwhile, the challenges the U.S. military and the rest of the U.S. government face in deterring hostile actors or actually responding to acts of aggression in space are by now fairly well established, although specific details remain scarce. Even more secretive are the kinds of capabilities that the United States is able to employ, in turn, to 'deny, disrupt, and degrade' — and even destroy — the systems of its adversaries. While Saltzman wasn’t able to provide anything in the way of specifics, his comments may well reflect a growing openness to address these issues in the public arena.

U.S.-Ukraine Reach Agreement On Terms For Total Ceasefire With Ru...	The U.S. and Ukraine have reached a ceasefire agreement in principle that would pause fighting in the now-three-year-old war and pave the way for the U.S. to obtain mineral rights, according to a joint statement between the two nations that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on his official web account. In return, the U.S. 'will immediately lift the pause on intelligence sharing and resume security assistance to Ukraine.' The U.S. imposed that pause last week, which you can read more about in our in-depth report here. The peace talks took place in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia after deteriorating relations between Washington and Kyiv. You can read more about the negotiations in our recent report here. 'Ukraine expressed readiness to accept the US proposal to enact an immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire, which can be extended by mutual agreement of the parties, and which is subject to acceptance and concurrent implementation by the Russian Federation,' Zelensky stated. 'The United States will communicate to Russia that Russian reciprocity is the key to achieving peace.' In a statement on Telegram, Zelensky said that the proposal from the American side was to 'immediately take the first step&#8230;and try to establish a complete ceasefire for 30 days, not only with regard to missiles, drones and bombs, not only in the Black Sea, but also along the entire frontline.' Both Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump 'agreed to conclude as soon as possible a comprehensive agreement for developing Ukraine’s critical mineral resources to expand Ukraine’s economy, offset the cost of American assistance, and guarantee Ukraine’s long-term prosperity and security.' The Ukrainian delegation also 'reiterated the Ukrainian people’s strong gratitude to President Trump, the U.S. Congress, and the people of the United States for making possible meaningful progress toward peace.' Speaking to reporters after the negotiation session wrapped, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said it is now up to Russia to decide if it wants to pursue peace. 'Today, we made an offer that the Ukrainians have accepted, which is to enter into a ceasefire and into immediate negotiations to end this conflict in a way that's enduring and sustainable and accounts for their interests, their security, their ability to prosper as a nation,' said Rubio. 'We'll take this offer now to the Russians, and we hope that they'll say yes, that they'll say yes to peace. The ball is now in their court.' The agreement announcement does not specify what conditions Ukraine agreed to, though Rubio had previously said Ukraine would have to give up land in any deal. This is a developing story and there is still a long way to go before fighting ends.

Drones Rained Down On Moscow Ahead Of Ukraine Peace Talks	Ukrainian drones pummeled Moscow overnight, only hours before high-stakes talks began in Saudi Arabia between officials from Ukraine and the United States. The attack on the Russian capital, using long-range one-way attack drones, was the biggest of the conflict so far, local officials claimed. According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, Ukraine launched 337 drones at Russia overnight, with 91 of these targeting the Moscow region. The attacks on the capital region killed at least three people, set buildings ablaze, and forced the suspension of flights at all four of Moscow’s airports, as well as rail services. Two other airports, in the Yaroslavl and Nizhny Novgorod regions east of Moscow, were also closed. Photos and videos posted to social media showed scenes of destruction in the Ramenskoye district, around 30 miles southeast of the Kremlin, and in Domodedovo, in Moscow’s southern suburbs, where a supermarket and adjacent parking lot were struck. This killed three security guards and damaged about 40 vehicles, Russian authorities said. A video capture shows destroyed vehicles after a massive drone attack at the Leninsky urban district (Vidnoye) and Domodedovo (Yam village) at 4:00 a.m. in Moscow on March 11, 2025. Photo by Moscow Governorship / Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu Witnesses said that the drone strikes began around 3:00 a.m. this morning, local time. Some Russian citizens took to the Telegram messaging app to complain about the apparent lack of early warning from Russia’s emergency services. According to the Russian news outlet Kommersant, Ukraine mainly used its homegrown Liutyi (Fierce) drones for the latest strikes on Moscow. However, at least one unverified video shows what appears to be a Ukrainian version of the Shahed/Geran series, which is the primary long-range one-way attack drone used by Russia to strike targets across Ukraine. It’s unclear how many of the Ukrainian drones were successfully intercepted by Russian air defenses, although exorbitant claims have been made regularly in the past. On this occasion, Shot, a Telegram channel with links to the security services, cited a former Russian serviceman who reportedly shot down one of the drones with a hunting rifle in a small village outside Moscow. While Ukrainian drone strikes on targets deep inside Russia, including the capital, have been a feature of the conflict for many months, the overnight raids were clearly timed to send a message ahead of today’s talks in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. A communal worker clears debris, including an apparent fragment of a downed drone, in the yard of a damaged apartment building following a drone attack in the village of Misaylovo in the Moscow region on March 11, 2025. Photo by TATYANA MAKEYEVA / AFP TATYANA MAKEYEVA A senior Ukrainian official said the drone attack should encourage Russian President Vladimir Putin to accept the terms of an aerial ceasefire proposed by Kyiv. 'The largest drone attack in history was carried out on Moscow and the Moscow region,' said Andriy Kovalenko, a Ukrainian national security council official responsible for countering disinformation. He added, 'This is an additional signal to Putin that he should also be interested in a ceasefire in the air.' A view shows a damaged apartment building in a residential complex following a drone attack in the village of Sapronovo in the Moscow region on March 11, 2025. Photo by TATYANA MAKEYEVA / AFP TATYANA MAKEYEVA The large-scale — apparently unprecedented — Ukrainian drone strikes are intended to signal clearly to Moscow and Washington that Kyiv won’t accept an unfavorable peace deal and remains committed to repulsing the full-scale Russian invasion. This is a reality that has also been picked up by Russian sources. 'The meaning behind this largest drone attack on the Moscow region is clear — it coincides with the start of negotiations in Saudi Arabia, where Ukraine will try to push for an air and naval ceasefire that is entirely unfavorable to Russia,' wrote the popular pro-Kremlin channel MIG Russia on Telegram. 'The raid is meant to suggest that such a decision would supposedly benefit all parties … But it won’t work,' the channel added. There has not yet been a formal statement from the Kremlin about Kyiv’s proposal for a partial ceasefire, which is expected to include, among others, an end to aerial drone and missile strikes and a suspension of military activity in the Black Sea. However, previous similar suggestions have been rejected by Moscow, which has accused Ukraine of looking to find ways for a pause in the fighting that will allow it to rebuild its military for a future counteroffensive. Ukraine’s position is made more complicated by the strained relationship with the United States, which has now hit pause on military support for Ukraine, as well as access to intelligence and satellite feeds. In an effort to try to rebuild the relationship after a disastrous meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington at the end of last month, as you can read about here, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky traveled to Saudi Arabia yesterday. In addition to pushing for a partial ceasefire on its terms, Ukraine also aims to persuade the Trump administration to restart intelligence-sharing and military aid. There are also the issues of hostage exchanges and the return of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia. These are also likely to figure prominently in the talks.

Photo by Ukrainian Presidency / Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu For Kyiv, the talks with officials from the United States are far from the only critical aspect of the conflict right now. There is also the increasing difficulty of holding territory in the Kursk region of western Russia, where Ukrainian forces launched a large-scale incursion last August. While you can read more about the current situation on the ground in Kursk here, it’s notable that the overnight drone raids also apparently struck multiple targets in this region. Russian authorities said that than 100 drones were launched toward the Kursk region. Today, the Russian Ministry of Defense claimed its troops had regained more than 100 square kilometers (38.6 square miles) of territory and 12 settlements in Kursk in recent days. It’s also worth noting that heavy airstrikes have not been all one-way traffic. An especially heavy Russian attack using long-range one-way attack drones and cruise missiles was prosecuted against Ukraine on the night of March 6-7. According to an assessment from the U.K. Ministry of Defense, up to 35 Kh-101 air-launched cruise missiles were launched, together with sea-launched Kalibr cruise missiles, short-range ballistic missiles, and as many as 100 aerial drones. The main targets appear to have been related to Ukrainian energy infrastructure, which Russia repeatedly strikes, especially in the winter months. As for the meeting in Jeddah, it’s widely expected that U.S. demands for some kind of minerals deal with Ukraine will be at the center of the discussions, which involve U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his Ukrainian counterparts. Asked on Fox News if he thought Ukraine could sign the minerals deal this week, Trump Middle East aide Steve Witkoff said: 'I am really hopeful. All the signs are very, very positive.' U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan and National Security Advisor Mosaad bin Mohammad al-Aiban, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Ukrainian Head of Presidential Office Andriy Yermak and Ukrainian Minister of Defense Rustem Umerovto attend a meeting between the United States and Ukraine hosted by the Saudis on March 11, 2025, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Photo by Salah Malkawi/Getty Images Salah Malkawi If the parties are able to hammer out some kind of a peace proposal, the big question is what the military terms and conditions will look like. Rubio has previously said that 'both sides need to come to an understanding that there’s no military solution to this situation.' 'I’m not going to set any conditions on what they have to or need to do. I think we want to listen to see how far they’re willing to go and then compare that to what the Russians want and see how far apart we truly are,' Rubio added. For Russia, Washington’s new approach toward Ukraine has been celebrated. After three years of a steadfast U.S.-led bulwark against Russian aggression in Ukraine, Trump’s decision to try and extend his rapport with the Russian leader has altered the dynamics of the conflict and geopolitical relations. Russian officials are now indicating that behind-the-scenes discussions between officials in Washington and the Kremlin have been stepped up. Reports today indicate that Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, plans to visit Moscow to meet Putin for talks. While the United States will likely continue to take a hard line with Ukraine in the Saudi talks, there are still plenty more challenges ahead if a ceasefire is to be negotiated, not least Russian willingness to accept whatever kind of deal emerges from today’s meeting.

New satellite images obtained by The War Zone show that scores of people are seeking shelter today at Russia's Khmeimim Air Base from fighting between the new Syrian government and forces loyal to deposed leader Bashar Al-Assad. The members of the Alawite minority began flocking to the Russian stronghold on Syria’s Mediterranean coast after hundreds of people were reportedly executed by Syrian security forces. You can read our latest update on the decaying security situation in western Syria here. The images, collected by Maxar on Monday, show throngs of people and vehicles gathered at the base near Latakia after some of the worst fighting in Syria since Al Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) brought down the Assad regime in December and installed an Islamist transitional government. The battles have largely pitted HTS' Sunni forces against the Shia Alawites, a sect to which Assad belongs. The following image shows an overview of the base.

This is the same area where a Syrian Il-76 has been parked since Assad escaped to the base in December. You can read more about this aircraft and its murky flight from Damascus to the air base in this past feature. Troop tents are seen near an Il-76 transport jet. (Satellite image ©2025 Maxar Technologies) Wood, Stephen According to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR), a London-based watchdog group, Assad regime loyalists killed 383 people, including 211 civilians and 172 Syrian security forces, while Syrian security forces killed 396 people during the fighting. That figure includes civilians and disarmed fighters. The statistics do not account for the number of Assad regime loyalists killed, The Guardian noted. The Syrian interior ministry has admitted that some 'individual violations' have taken place. This, they say, is the result of people heading toward the villages being attacked . On Sunday, interim Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa said his government would hold accountable anyone involved in the deaths of civilians during the heavy fighting. Sharaa had previously described the violence as 'expected challenges.' U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemned the violence. 'The United States stands with Syria’s religious and ethnic minorities, including its Christian, Druze, Alawite, and Kurdish communities, and offers its condolences to the victims and their families,' Rubio stated Sunday on X. 'Syria’s interim authorities must hold the perpetrators of these massacres against Syria’s minority communities accountable.' 'Living conditions in the coastal region and its mountains have worsened as food supplies and daily necessities have been cut off for days,' The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), another London-based watchdog organization, reported. 'This coincided with the ongoing security operation in the coastal area, which was launched following an attack by Alawite militants on security forces’ checkpoints and the Ministry of Defense on Thursday, March 6.' Amid the turmoil, 'dozens of people who fled their homes to seek refuge' at the base 'staged a sit-in protest against the executions and crimes committed by members of the Ministries of Defense and Interior and their allied gunmen, against members of the Alawite sect,' SOHR claimed. 'The protesters chanted against ethnic cleansing and held banners with slogans demanding international protection from the massacres that have left hundreds dead,' SOHR explained. 'Those sheltering at the base refused to leave and return to their homes despite local efforts urging them to return with assurances of protection.' Many of Russia’s forces have been withdrawn from Khmeimim and the naval base in Tartus following the collapse of the Assad government. However, the future of both remains uncertain. Russia prizes access to these two bases, and recent reports suggest that Moscow is still trying to strike a deal to ensure continued access. Regardless of the outcome of those negotiations, that people have fled to escape violence highlights the precarious nature of post-Assad Syria.

AI-Enabled Cognitive Electronic Warfare Capability Plugs Into F-1...	TWZ's Jamie Hunter recently talked with Bryan Rosselli, President of advanced products and solutions for Raytheon, to get the lowdown on the AI-infused Cognitive Algorithm Deployment System (CADS) that is made to work with the company's AN/ALR-69 digital radar warning receiver (RWR). The biggest user of this RWR currently is the F-16 Viper fighter, but pairing it with CADS could work with many aircraft if AN/ALR-69 is integrated on them. Currently the RWR is also installed on KC-46 tankers and C-130 cargo planes, and will be on the Navy's upcoming MQ-25 Stingray tanker drones. CADS will also be able to plug into other types of systems to provide other AI-focused tasks. In CADS, we are seeing the emergence of cognitive electronic warfare — the ability for an electronic countermeasure and radar warning system to autonomously adapt to radio frequency threats, including those that are not even loaded into its threat library. Clearly, the convenience of being able to install CADS on F-16s and other aircraft already equipped with AN/ALR-69 makes it a very attractive option that could really impact survivability of these platforms in future fights. The video below, shot at the Air Force Association's 2025 Warfare Symposium in Aurora, Colorado, last week, gives us a broader look at CADS and what it is supposed to do: Contact the author: Tyer@twz.com	https://www.twz.com/air/ai-enabled-cognitive-electronic-warfare-capability-plugs-into-f-16s-existing-radar-warning-receiver	2025-03-10T14:19:15-07:00	https://www.twz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ALR69.jpg?quality=85
Russian Raiders Crawled For Miles Through Gas Pipeline To Attack ...	Details have emerged of an extraordinary mission launched by Russian soldiers in the Kursk region, during which they penetrated deep into Ukrainian-held territory via a gas pipeline. The soldiers — reportedly around 100 in total — were apparently tasked with an assault on Sudzha, a critical Ukrainian-held town in the region. Although the results of the raid are unclear at this stage, it further underscores the huge challenge that Ukraine faces if it’s to retain a foothold in this area of western Russia.

Kursk region. An alleged photo of the gas pipeline through which the Russians wanted to infiltrate Sudzha unnoticed.&mdash; MAKS 24 (@maks23.bsky.social) 2025-03-08T18:50:53.983Z Multiple photos and videos purportedly documenting the operation have also been published by Russian military social media accounts, including showing soldiers wearing breathing gear and moving down the pipeline that is only around 4.5 feet wide. Reportedly, the raiders spent four days crawling through the pipeline, which is roughly nine miles long. Unconfirmed reports suggest that some of the soldiers may have suffocated while in the pipeline. However, at least some made it out. According to Butusov’s source: 'The enemy used a gas pipeline and came out in area N [the precise location is concealed for security purposes]… It was not a surprise, as we knew about this action. But the focus had been shifted to Kurilovka [a village south of Sudzha] a few days ago.' Another account suggests that the Russians did achieve some element of surprise, with the use of the pipeline ensuring that these forces could be moved without being detected by Ukrainian surveillance drones. The same source notes that Russian preparations for the mission included airstrikes in the vicinity of the area, something that took place over several days. It’s reported that the Russian army has intensified attacks in Kursk region of Russia.According to unverified information,Russians have gotten to Ukrainian positions in Sudzha through the Druzhba gas pipeline this morning.Reportedly,the pipeline is under increased observation&mdash; Anton Gerashchenko (@antongerashchenko.bsky.social) 2025-03-08T16:21:53.198Z The exact pipeline used by the Russian soldiers is not entirely clear, although all signs point to it being part of the Urengoy-Pomary-Uzhhorod gas pipeline. Also known as the Brotherhood pipeline, or West-Siberian Pipeline, this was previously used to transport Russian gas to Europe via Ukraine. Partially owned and operated by Ukraine, it has been out of use since the end of 2024.

Sudzha has been occupied by Ukrainian forces since mid-August 2024 after they launched an incursion into the region. About 100 Russians use gas pipeline to reach Ukrainian positions near Sudzha, Kursk Oblast&mdash; Ukrainska Pravda (@pravda.ua) 2025-03-08T11:36:34.848Z What happened to the Russian soldiers after they arrived in Sudzha is also unclear at this stage. One report suggests that 'efforts are underway to eliminate the infiltrators,' while surveillance of the pipeline has now been stepped up to avoid a repeat of the raid. The Ukrainian General Staff released footage purportedly showing Ukrainian troops engaging some of the Russian assault troops after they emerged from the tunnel, shown below: Destruction of Russian soldiers who came out of a gas pipeline in the Kursk region!&mdash; MAKS 24 (@maks23.bsky.social) 2025-03-08T19:47:10.620Z It’s certainly possible that at least some elements of the Russian assault company linked up with other troops already on the ground in the Sudzha area. After all, Russian forces achieved a breakthrough of the Ukrainian defensive line south of the town in recent days. The area is now a focus of fighting, as the Ukrainian Armed Forces try and hold the Russians back to avoid an encirclement and the cutting off of vital supply routes. Ukrainian troops install defenses across a key route within the Sumy region to protect against a potential Russian counterassault out of the Kursk region on the other side of the border. Photo by Serhiy Morgunov/for The Washington Post Serhiy Morgunov 'Russian special forces are being detected, blocked, and destroyed. Enemy losses in the Sudzha area are very heavy,' Ukraine’s military claimed. The current situation has been developing for some time now, with the Russians increasing their focus on Sudzha. Even before the end of last year, Russian troops had entered the village of Kurilovka, south of Sudzha, and forced a Ukrainian brigade to give up its positions. 'After that, the enemy built up its forces and systematically launched assault operations,' a Ukrainian military source told Ukrainska Pravda on March 7. 'Yesterday and the day before [6 and 5 March], they made a breakthrough.' Some of the key locations in the current fighting for Sudzha. Google Earth In particular, it seems Russian forces are aiming to take control of the road running between Sumy, Yunakivka, and Sudzha, which provides the Ukrainians with a critical access route into the Kursk region. A string of other villages to the north of Sudzha have already been recaptured, including Staraya, Novaya Sorochina, and Malaya Loknya, as well as other small settlements to the immediate east of the town. Overall, the situation for the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Kursk region is becoming increasingly precarious. Ukrainian reports state that the Russians are 'carrying out massive attacks along the entire front of the Kursk sanitary zone … and are assaulting relentlessly.' As well as having significantly more firepower — especially artillery — the Russians are backed up by North Korean troops, bolstering what is already a significant numerical advantage. This Russian military ID was found on a North Korean soldier in the Kursk region and presented by soldiers from the Ukrainian 8th Special Operations Forces Regiment, 1st Battalion. Photo by Ed Ram/for The Washington Post via Getty Images The Washington Post Russia’s ex-president, Dmitry Medevdev, recently claimed that Ukrainian forces in Kursk were almost surrounded and would soon be driven out. 'The lid of the smoking cauldron is almost closed. The offensive continues,' he posted on Telegram. Holding territory in Kursk over the long term was always going to be a huge challenge for Ukraine. Even with adequate supplies of ammunition, the flanks of the so-called 'sanitary zone' are being repeatedly attacked by Russian ground forces and airpower. Meanwhile, the front of the zone has narrowed, making it more difficult to hold. At the same time, the United States has now hit pause on military support for Ukraine, as well as access to intelligence and satellite feeds. There are now increasing calls from Ukrainian analysts to withdraw entirely from Kursk, with the tables now apparently firmly tilted in the Russians’ favor. Ukrainian tank crew at a fallback position in the Sumy region, Ukraine, last December. The troops from the 95th Air Assault Brigade were preparing for orders to return to the Kursk region. Photo by Serhiy Morgunov/for The Washington Post Serhiy Morgunov On the other hand, the political importance of Ukraine having a foothold in Russia shouldn’t be discounted. Indeed, with critical talks between Ukraine and the United States due to being in Saudi Arabia this week, holding onto what is a key bargaining chip is perhaps now more important than ever for Kyiv. It’s expected that the talks will see Ukraine propose a peace plan that will include an end to aerial drone and missile strikes, together with a suspension of military activity in the Black Sea. The pipeline raid highlights the importance to Russia of recapturing this territory. Less clear is how long Ukraine can hold out as losses mount and the tide of public opinion threatens to turn against what was, at the start, a notably bold operation but one that now is becoming increasingly perilous for the forces that Kyiv has committed there.

Tanker That Exploded In North Sea Collision One Of 10 In U.S. Fue...	The Stena Immaculate, one of 10 vessels in a U.S. program to supply the U.S. armed forces with fuel during times of conflict or national emergency, is in flames after a collision in the North Sea. The incident comes amid growing concerns about America’s ability to sustain itself via sealift in a future fight. The oil tanker, anchored near Hull, U.K., was carrying Jet-A fuel when the cargo ship Solong struck it, according to a radio transmission from the U.K.’s Humber Coastguard and a statement from the company managing the Stena Immaculate. The incident took place at about 10 a.m. local time, the Florida-based Crowley company told The War Zone in a statement. Stena Immaculate 'sustained a ruptured cargo tank containing Jet-A fuel due to the collision,' a Crowley spokesperson told us. 'A fire occurred as a result of the collision, and fuel was reported released. The Stena Immaculate crew abandoned the vessel following multiple explosions onboard. All Crowley mariners are safe and fully accounted for.' Fire and rescue services reacted to a collision between the oil tanker Stena Immaculate and the cargo vessel Solong off the coast of the Humber Estuary on March 10, 2025. (Photo by Lee Whitaker/Getty Images) Getty Images Video emerged on social media showing the Stena Immaculate ablaze. BREAKING:Major maritime disaster off the coast of Hull, England after a collision between a cargo ship and an oil tanker.The fire can be seen from miles away pic.twitter.com/WiaX0rUHGR&mdash; Visegrád 24 (@visegrad24) March 10, 2025 The cause of the collision is unclear, however, it took place in heavy fog, Sal Mercogliano, a former Military Sealift Command (MSC) mariner and associate professor of history at Campbell University, told The War Zone. Mercagliano produced a YouTube video offering his insights about the incident which you can see below. The Portuguese-flagged Solong left the Scottish port of Grangemouth on Sunday evening and was headed for Rotterdam, the Netherlands, according to the VesselFinder ship tracking website. The Stena Immaculate, bound for Killingholme in the U.K., was at anchor off the coast near the city of Hull after traveling from the Greek port of Agioi Theodoroi last month. Stena Immaculate was built in China and named in 2017. In May 2023 it became one of three ships managed by the Florida-based Crowley company to enroll in the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Maritime Administration’s (MARAD) Tanker Security Program (TSP). The program was created to augment the U.S. Defense Department’s (DoD) logistics capabilities with U.S.-based product tankers. The Stena Immaculate was named during a ceremony in China in 2017. (Stena Bulk) The TSP was born under the Biden administration to establish a fleet of 'active, commercially viable, militarily useful, privately owned product tank vessels of the United States that will meet national defense and other security requirements and maintain a United States presence in international commercial shipping,' according to DOT. 'The program will ensure the Department of Defense (DoD) has assured access to critically needed product tankers capable of loading, transporting, and storing on-station bulk petroleum refined products to support national economic security,' DOT explained. 'The TSP accomplishes two key maritime sealift objectives: it grows our U.S.-flagged fleet and it significantly expands our ability to deliver vital fuel supplies to support military missions across the globe,' then-Maritime Administrator Ann Phillips said in 2023. Under the TSP program, each tanker vessel enrolled receives a maximum $6 million per year payment, prorated monthly for qualified service as participants in the program, DOT noted. The vessels will operate in U.S. foreign commerce and be available for use by the United States during times of war or national emergency. Ships qualifying for the TSP program have to be medium-range product tankers between 30,000-60,000 deadweight tons with a fuel-carrying capacity of 230,000 barrels or more, be less than 10 years of age, and be available to commit to an emergency preparedness agreement for the duration of the program’s authorization. Stena's Imperative and Immaculate; both of which have been selected for the Tanker Security Program. Crowley The loss of 10% of the TSP fleet comes amid larger concerns about the U.S. ability to supply its forces around the globe by sea. U.S.-flagged tankers won’t be enough to meet DoD’s fueling needs in a future war, Rear Adm. Phillip Sobeck, head of the Military Sealift Command (MSC), warned last year. 'The game has changed under our feet,' Sobeck told an audience at the Navy League’s Sea Air Space 2024 symposium near Washington, D.C. He added that global partnerships that spanned industry and government would be necessary to answer China’s network of large tankers in event of a conflict. MSC needs these relationships not only to increase capacity in an emergency but also to benefit from their experience and feasibility assessments regarding moving bulk fuel. MSC’s fleet of 140 ships can grow to more than 400 in a time of need, Sobeck said, referring to a surge capacity that involves U.S.-flagged commercial ships. As we reported in the past, data compiled by the Office of Naval Intelligence says that a growing gap in fleet sizes is being helped by China’s shipbuilders being more than 200 times more capable of producing surface warships and submarines. This is thanks to the dual-use nature of China's massive shipyards. Its much larger maritime production footprint and commercial fleet size means that it can activate many more ships if need be during a time of war. Highlighting concerns about the U.S. military’s sea lift capacity, the head of U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) told Congress last week that he wants to buy as many as 10 used shipping vessels to bolster the military’s Ready Reserve Force RRF fleet. Of the 46 ships in that fleet, 17 are more than 50 years old. 'We need to both build it here, and we actually need to buy used,' Air Force Gen. Randall Reed, Transcom's commander, told the Senate Armed Services Committee. 'These ships are really, really old. The reliability of them [is] sometimes in question because of that. I take my hat off to the crews that are actually on them to keep them warm. But to give an idea of the state of the ships, some of these ships are still run by steam.' The RORO cargo ship M/V Cape Isabel arrives in San Diego during a Turbo Activation exercise in 2017. (USAF) In 2019, TRANSCOM, MARAD and MSC held a massive snap sealift exercise across the United States involving 28 of those ships. You can read more about that in our story here. We reached out to Crowley, DOT and the Pentagon to find out more about who was going to receive the Stena Immaculate’s fuel, how much was on the ship, and how the apparent loss of this vessel will affect the TSP. Given the level of concern before this incident took place, this is unwelcome news to say the least.

Secretive AIM-260 Air-To-Air Missile Live-Fire Testing Surged Las...	Members of the U.S. Navy's Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 31 (VX-31) contributed to an important increase in live-fire testing of the secretive AIM-260A long-range air-to-air missile last year, it has emerged. In 2024, the 'Dust Devils' of VX-31 also made important contributions to the initial fielding of the AIM-174B air-launched version of the Standard Missile 6 (SM-6), which was in response to an 'emergent Pacific Fleet requirement.' The new details about VX-31's support to the AIM-260A and AIM-174B programs come via the announcement of awards that members of the squadron received last month, which user @AirPowerNEW1 on X was first to spot. The Dust Devils are based at Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake in California. The squadron supports various test and evaluation activities with a mixed fleet of aircraft that currently includes F/A-18F Super Hornets, EA-18G Growlers, and AV-8B+ Harriers, as well as MH-60S Seahawk helicopters. A group of VX-31 aircraft – from front to back, an F/A-18F Super Hornet, an EA-18G Growler, another F/A-18F, and an AV-8B+ Harrier – fly in formation in January 2025. USN 'CDR Christopher Putre, Commanding Officer of Air Test and Evaluation Squadron THREE ONE (VX-31) presents LCDR Orion Flurett with a Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal on December 19, 2024, in China Lake, CA. LCDR Flurett, recognized for his meritorious service while serving as Developmental Test-9 Detachment Officer In Charge, VX-31, FROMN [sic; from] July to August 2024,' one post on VX-31's official Facebook account reads. 'LCDR Flurett demonstrated extraordinary leadership and foresight, he planned, managed, and coordinated 78 personnel and two aircraft supporting the live-fire testing of the AIM-260 Joint Advanced Tactical Missile. In particular, his keen oversight and initiative were critical to receiving approval from NAVAIR [Naval Air Systems Command], VX-31, CTWP, and Eglin AFM [sic; Eglin Air Force Base] leadership for the last-minute increase to category C testing, resulting in the successful completion of 8 sorties encompassing 26.3 mishap-free flight hours, directly contributing to future air wing capabilities.' A screen capture of the VX-31 Facebook post about the award related to testing of the AIM-260. Facebook screen capture The post does not specify what types of aircraft supported this increased testing, or whether or not they came from VX-31 or another unit involved in AIM-260A testing. JATM is a joint program that the Navy is working on together with the U.S. Air Force. Active testing of the new missile, including live-fire shots, has already been ongoing for years now. F/A-18E/F Super Hornets are expected to be among the first types to carry AIM-260s operationally along with Air Force F-22 Raptor stealth fighters. It's unclear when the AIM-260 might be slated to enter operational service now. When the existence of the JATM first became public in 2019, the goal was to start fielding the missiles in 2022, but there are no indications that this has occurred. Details about the AIM-260 itself remain limited and no imagery of the missile has emerged to date. The Air Force did confirm to TWZ last month that a recently released JATM rendering reflects the real design. Key requirements for the AIM-260 are known to include substantially greater range than the existing AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), but in a package with the same form factor. The JATM is likely to have new advanced guidance and networking capabilities, as you can read more about here. A slide from an unclassified briefing from Naval Air Systems Command's Program Executive Office for Unmanned Aviation &#038; Strike Weapons (PEO U&#038;W) posted online in February 2025 showing missiles in its air-to-air portfolio including the AIM-260A and AIM-174B.

'Through August and September of 2024, they provided exceptional leadership for the rapid execution on the CATM project, facilitating and demonstrating the feasibility and relevance of the missiles for fleet flight operations. Their efforts enabled the program to meet and [sic; an] emergent Pacific Fleet requirement and provided the fleet with a key capability while meeting a time critical need.

The recent award announcement does provide some additional context around the missile's public unveiling as part of the biennial Rim of the Pacific exercise off Hawaii last year, which ran from June 27 to August 1. The Navy previously confirmed that the AIM-174B has already entered at least limited operational service. An F/A-18F from VX-9 seen carrying four AIM-174s, as well as other missiles and stores. USN CATM-174Bs seen under the wing of a VX-9 Super Hornet last year. point_mugu_skies The AIM-174B is derived from the combat-proven SM-6, which is a highly-capable multi-purpose missile in U.S. service in multiple ship and ground-launched configurations. SM-6 can engage aerial threats, including ballistic missiles in the terminal phase of flight and highly maneuverable hypersonic weapons under specific circumstances, as well as targets at sea and on land when used in a quasi-ballistic mode. The fact that the Navy's development of an air-launched version of SM-6 was driven at least in part by a requirement from U.S. Pacific Fleet is fully in line with TWZ's previous analysis. You can learn more about how the AIM-174B will factor into the Navy’s future air combat ecosystem, especially for fleet defense and attacking high-value assets, and in the context of a high-end fight with China in the Pacific, in our past in-depth feature and the video below. The Navy has otherwise been extremely tight-lipped about the AIM-174B. 'It exists,' Navy Rear Adm. Keith Hash, head of NAVAIR's Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD), said during a panel discussion at the WEST 2025 conference in January when asked about the new air-launched version of the SM-6. 'That's an operational capability. And, as you can see, that one being revealed and shown into the area, there are many more behind [it], things that we're doing there, making sure that we are staying ahead of the conflict, making sure that we're prepared for the fight that's going on. And those activities and that development is active and strong.' The VX-31 award announcements underscore just how significant the addition of the AIM-174B to the Navy's arsenal really is, especially when it comes to being prepared for a future major conflict with China in the Pacific, as well as the importance of ongoing work on the AIM-260.

Worst Fighting In Syria Since Fall Of Assad Regime	Syria is teetering on the brink of all-out civil war, once again, as fighting rages between the new regime in Damascus and fighters loyal to the deposed President Bashar al-Assad. The last few days have seen heavy fighting in the coastal region, with reports of dozens of the Alawite minority having been executed by Syrian security forces. The current violence in Syria is the worst since the rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) brought down the Assad regime in December and installed an Islamist transitional government. Search and sweep operations by Syrian government forces, in an effort to track down fighters loyal to the deposed Bashar al-Assad regime in Latakia, Syria, on March 7. Photo by Zettin Kasm/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu According to the U.K.-based Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR), around 125 civilians have been executed by government security forces in northwest Syria over the past two days. This is part of a larger total — around 240 people — who have been killed in the same period, including 100 Syrian security forces and 15 civilians at the hands of Assad loyalists. Many more have been injured. The SNHR documented 'large-scale field executions of men and young adults, without any clear distinction between civilians and combatants,' in northwest Syria.

'When we compromise our ethics, we reduce ourselves to the same level as our enemy,' he said in a video address. 'The remnants of the fallen regime are looking for a provocation that will lead to violations behind which they can seek refuge.' The fighting has been centered in the cities of Latakia and Tartus, in the coastal region, where curfews have been imposed. The first reports of fighting were in the town of Jableh, in Latakia province, where Assad-loyalist militants ambushed Syrian security forces.

Reports suggest that gunmen have taken control of some military zones in the coastal region after they launched attacks out of the Latakia mountains. In particular, parts of the towns of Qardaha and Baniyas are said to be under the control of Assad-loyalist forces. Another video, also verified by the BBC, shows fighting further inland, in the city of Homs. This footage shows gunmen firing automatic weapons at a building, after which a fire starts inside.

Aerial view of a tank being transported by fighters with the new Syrian government in Baniyas, Syria, on March 7. Photo by Ali Haj Suleiman/Getty Images Government forces launched a major operation in the town of Qardaha, Latakia province, on Friday, Syrian state media reports. The Syrian Ministry of Defense says its troops are targeting buildings and hills around the town where former regime fighters are hiding out. Overall, the campaign by the anti-government forces seems to have been fairly well planned. A video released by one former Assad regime officer shortly after the offensive began described it as Operation Coastal Shield. He also called upon Syria’s various sects to rise against the government in Damascus. The coastal region is the main stronghold of Syria’s Alawite minority, to which the Assad family belongs. The region has also been traditionally strongly pro-Assad. Since the fall of the former leader’s regime, Alawite activists have said that their community has been subjected to violence and attacks, especially in rural Homs and Latakia. A fighter with the new Syrian government rides on a tank in Baniyas, Syria, on March 7. Photo by Ali Haj Suleiman/Getty Images Ali Haj Suleiman The violence against the Alawites has now intensified, including apparent revenge killings. The SNHR says that in the town of al-Mukhtariya, in Latakia province, around 40 civilians were executed together in a single location. Videos — which have not been independently verified — show bodies dressed in civilian clothes piled on top of one another as well as gunmen executing seemingly unarmed men. The Syrian interior ministry has admitted that some 'individual violations' have taken place. This, they say, is the result of people heading toward the villages being attacked by Assad loyalists. The ministry has not claimed responsibility for any of the alleged executions. There was always a major risk that more intense fighting would break out again after the fall of the Assad regime, and it’s not a surprise that, now that it’s happened, the focus is on the coastal region.

Photo by Mohamad Daboul / Middle East Images / Middle East Images via AFP MOHAMAD DABOUL Clearly, this area provides Interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa with a major security challenge. However, there are problems elsewhere in the country, too. In recent days, there have been growing reports of violence in the south of Syria, where government forces have clashed with Druze forces. The young Syrian regime's tensions with other rebel factions, such as the Kurds, remains an issue too, among a litany of others. Complex alliances also complicate things further. Turkey, who strongly backs the new government and is outright hostile to the Kurds, and the U.S., who has backed Kurdish forces, makes the situation even more murky. Israel is also occupying more land in Southern Syria for its buffer zone, as it is becoming increasingly wary of the new government.

Turkey is already engaged in these efforts, but not anywhere near fully using the might of its regular forces. For Russia, such an arrangement would likely be made to try and secure continued access to its military bases in Syria’s coastal region. Much of Russia's forces have been withdrawn from the air base at Khmeimim and the naval base in Tartus. However, the future of both remains uncertain. Russia's ability to step in as it did for Assad a decade ago is questionable, with all focus being on the war in Ukraine. But the strategic importance of both bases is great. While providing the new government with economic backing and other assistance could secure these facilities, that would only be as long as the current regime remains in power. As such, reengaging militarily may be seen as necessary in order to ensure their survival. It's also worth noting that these facilities are in the same areas hardest hit by the resistance fighting right now, which is a vulnerability, especially considering the drawdown in Russian forces there. The idea that Russia could fight for the very people it bombed mercilessly for many years on Assad's behalf is darkly ironic, but not totally alien to a region where allegiances can shift with the sands. A potential Russian deal with the new Syrian regime remains speculative for now, and Moscow may well prefer to wait and see what happens next. If the current government in Damascus is eventually toppled, it may then be able to strike some kind of a deal with whatever polity is left over. Another image of search and sweep operations by Syrian government forces in Latakia, Syria, on March 7. Photo by Zettin Kasm/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu Whatever the case, Russia prizes access to these two bases, and there have been recent reports that Moscow is still trying to strike a deal that would ensure continued access. For now, it remains unclear exactly how substantial the ex-regime factions in Syria actually are and whether they could eventually threaten the integrity of the new government. There are other flashpoints, too, including in the southeast, which has seen an incursion by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) as part of wider Israeli military efforts against Syria. At this point, however, the spiraling violence in the coastal region is a huge concern and could yet spill over into something like an all-out civil war.

U.S. Army AH-64 Apaches Armed With Israeli Spike Missiles Now Fly...	U.S. Army AH-64 Apache attack helicopters are now flying in Iraq carrying Israeli-made Spike NLOS (Non-Line Of Sight) missiles. This appears to be the first time Army AH-64s have deployed to an active conflict zone with these weapons. Spike NLOS offers significantly greater reach against targets on land and at sea, as well as enhanced employment flexibility, over the AGM-114 Hellfires and AGM-179 Joint Air-to-Ground Missiles (JAGM) that are also in the arsenal of Army Apaches. The Army released a set of images of an AH-64 assigned to the 101st Airborne Division armed with Spike NLOS missiles at Erbil International Airport in Iraq's northern semi-autonomous Kurdish region earlier today. All of the pictures were taken on March 5. Erbil is a major hub for U.S. military operations in Iraq and elsewhere in the region. A US Army AH-64 Apache assigned to the 101st Airborne Division seen carrying Spike NLOS missiles in Iraq on March 5, 2025. US Army/Staff Sgt. Vincent Levelev The U.S. Air Force had previously released pictures showing a C-17A Globemaster III cargo plane delivering AH-64s from the 101st Airborne Division's 101st Combat Aviation Brigade to an undisclosed location in the Middle East last month.

USAF/Airman 1st Class Sarah Ortega Corona The Army also released pictures recently showing Spike NLOS-armed Apaches assigned to the 12th Aviation Brigade taking part in Exercise Allied Spirit '25 in Germany. At least one of those images looks to have been subsequently taken offline for unclear reasons. A Spike-NLOS-armed AH-64 assigned to the 12th Combat Aviation Brigade in Germany. US Army Spike NLOS has been in service with the Israel Defense Force (IDF) since the 1980s. The missile, which is fired from ground and aerial platforms from a rectangular launch canister, has been improved upon multiple times since then. The current generation version can hit targets up to 20 miles away, according to manufacturer Rafael. For comparison, the variants the Hellfire and JAGM that the Apache can also fire have maximum ranges under 10 miles, but normal engagement distances are usually closer than that. Hellfires and JAGMs with tripled and doubled ranges, respectively, have been tested. A promotional image showing what the Spike NLOS missile looks like after launch with its pop-out wings and tail fins in their deployed positions. Rafael Spike NLOS also offers a multi-mode guidance system that can hit fixed targets based on a set of coordinates or be employed using the man-in-the-loop (MITL) control method. In the latter mode, the operator 'sees' what the missile does throughout the entire course of flight via an infrared camera in the weapon's nose, and can manually make fine adjustments in the terminal phase. With the exception of the millimeter wave radar guided AGM-114L Longbow Hellfire, all known Hellfire variants are laser guided. JAGM features laser and millimeter wave radar guidance. Spike NLOS can also loiter for a short period of time while the operator looks for targets. The ability to hit targets behind cover is also a major feature of Spike NLOS. As TWZ has previously explained: 'This gives Spike-NLOS incredible accuracy, even against moving targets, and enables it to find its mark in bad weather or in parts of the battlefield obscured by smoke and dust, which could disrupt traditional laser or imaging seeker systems. As the weapon’s name implies, it also offers a way for the launch platform to engage targets beyond-line-of-sight, while also remaining as hidden as possible, especially when coupled with targeting information from off-board platforms. It also offers the operator a greater ability to more significantly shift the weapon’s point of impact, even very late in flight, should circumstances on the ground change, such as the sudden appearance of innocent bystanders in the target area. The weapon can even be used to search for and kill targets of opportunity far from where the launch platform is located. Regardless, the missile offers the launch platform huge flexibility and a big boost in survivability.' 'The Army has already demonstrated the potential value of these capabilities in earlier testing. In August 2019, an Apache hiding on one side of a 1,600-foot-tall mountain at Yuma Proving Ground in Arizona hit a surrogate for a Russian-made Pantsir-S1 point air defense system on the opposite slope with a Spike-NLOS. The helicopter remained largely concealed from and out of range of this simulated threat the entire time. An unspecified unmanned aircraft was used to first spot the target and then observe the strike.' The Army has also successfully demonstrated the ability of an Apache to destroy a small boat with a Spike NLOS, something TWZ was first to report. The picture of the AH-64 with the Spike NLOS missiles in Iraq also shows that the helicopter has the Manned-Unmanned Teaming-Extended (MUMT-X) system mounted on top of its rotor mast. MUMT-X is a communications and data-sharing array primarily designed to allow Apache crews to control uncrewed aircraft like the MQ-1C Gray Eagle, as well as pipe in the feeds from their sensors. This, in turn, can help Apaches find and target enemy forces, as well as just improve their overall situational awareness and avoid threats. You can read more about MUMT-X here. Whether or not the MUMT-X system can play any role now in the employment of Spike NLOS is unknown. The AH-64 in Iraq armed with these missiles also has a 'bucket-style' antenna for the Spike control datalink on its left stub wing. This has been a standard feature on Israeli Apaches that carry Spike for decades. Close-ups of the Spike NLOS-armed Apache in Iraq showing the datalink installed on the left stub wing.

This helicopter also lacks MUMT-X. US Army A Spike NLOS-armed US Army Apache seen during testing with the datalink installed on its right stub wing. This helicopter also has the Longbow mast-mounted radar rather than the MUMT-X system. US Army Exactly when the Army began fielding Spike NLOS operationally on its AH-64s is unclear, but the service had previously said it expected to reach that milestone by the end of last year. The Army had decided to field the missile on a limited basis as an interim solution to a requirement for a Long Range Precision Munition for its Apaches back in 2020. The Army is still looking into other options, including air-launched loitering munitions, to expand the ability of its Apaches to engage targets at extended ranges. Concerns about increasingly more capable and longer-ranged air defense threats have been a major driver behind these efforts. The ongoing war in Ukraine has provided particular good examples of the continuing value of attack helicopters, but also of their vulnerability on modern battlefields. The U.S. Marine Corps is now working to extend the lethal reach of its AH-1Z Viper attack helicopters for many of the same reasons. With Spike NLOS, the Army has already given its Apache fleets, including ones now flying in Iraq, the ability to very accurately attack targets much further away than they could previously.

Ukraine Feeling Impact Of U.S. Arms, Intel Pause	Days after U.S. officials announced a temporary pause on providing arms and some intelligence products to Ukraine, Russia on Friday made advances in its Kursk region and launched a massive missile and drone bombardment on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. The pause in assistance to Ukraine came in the wake of the blowout between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during an Oval Office press conference called to discuss the peace process. The cutoff of U.S. intelligence 'significantly impacts Ukrainian force protection of High Value Equipment's shoot, move and scoot timelines, indications and warning of high-threat aircraft,' a retired high-ranking Ukrainian officer told us. 'It significantly hampers the ability to target Russian forces and conduct long-range strikes against critical, mobile high-value targets.' The U.S. pause in providing intelligence to Ukraine is affecting how its troops can use weapons like the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), according to one retired high-ranking Ukrainian officer. (Photo by Anastasia Vlasova for The Washington Post via Getty Images) The lack of satellite imagery over Kursk is playing a role in the Russian advance there, the retired officer added. The lack of air defense munitions is making it harder to battle Russian airstrikes. 'The move of Russia in Kursk was a surprise to us,' one battlefield commander told The War Zone. 'We only had information about the attack right when it came.' The commander did not know if there was a direct correlation, 'but the fact is that the information is coming too late.' The new Russian counteroffensive in Kursk is designed to dislodge Ukrainian forces who have been there since August. Ukraine may be forced to withdraw from the region, according to one media report. BREAKING: Russia has made gains in Kursk region around south Sudzha&mdash; Samuel Ramani (@SamRamani2) March 7, 2025 'Ukrainian troops defending captured territory in Russia's Kursk region are under fierce attack from a Russian counteroffensive that’s building up steam, and commanders will soon have to make a tough choice whether to continue the struggle or withdraw,' Politico reported. 'If they get the timing wrong, Ukrainian forces risk being be cut off, warn military analysts.' 'The Ukrainian command must make a choice. Leave the Kursk region, completing the operation and preserving forces, or hold on, risking losing everything,' military analyst Yan Matveyev told the publication.

Kabanov told the Post that those desired effects were not achieved in the long run. 'A greater effect was probably expected,' he said, adding that the ‘victory’ for Ukraine had been the ‘political and psychological effect’ of the Kursk operation on Putin,' Kabanov said. 'Capturing Sudzha is an achievement, a certain demonstration of strength and capabilities. Did this actually achieve anything in the long term? As we see — no.' 'The situation in the Kursk borderland has become much more active: there has been no retreat of the Ukrainian Armed Forces from Malaya Loknya yet, but an assault is already underway, and the situation for the occupation forces there is very bad,' the Russian Defense Ministry (MoD) claimed on Telegram. 'The problems with logistics have finally begun to develop into a collapse of the defense. Day and night, drones are taking out equipment and ammunition, attempts to send reinforcements and carry out rotation are being stopped. We are expecting good news.' Trump administration systematically eroding Ukrainian battlefield capabilities (today, it's Maxar that's blocked), and Russia predictably taking battlefield advantage (latest: massive strike + kursk offensive) Roland Oliphant (@RolandOliphant) March 7, 2025 As its troops appeared to be advancing in Kursk, Russia launched a massive missile and drone attack, largely aimed at Ukraine's energy infrastructure. It marked the first such Russian attack since the U.S. stopped providing intelligence products to Ukraine. 'On the night of March 7, 2025, Russian occupiers carried out a combined strike with missiles of different types of air, land and sea bases on critical infrastructure objects,' the Ukrainian Air Force stated. 'The main focus of the impact is on the objects of the gas mining industry of Ukraine.' The Air Force claimed that its radio-technical troops 'detected and escorted 261 enemy air assault vehicles - 67 rockets of various types and 194 attack drones and imitation drones of various types. 'The air attack of the enemy was repelled by anti-aircraft missile units, REB equipment and mobile fire groups of the Air Force and Defense Forces of Ukraine,' the Ukrainian Air Force stated. At least two people were injured as a result of the attacks after a Russian missile damaged two residential buildings in Poltava Oblast, according to the Kyiv Independent. 'Russia took advantage of this intel gap and launched a major strike package against Ukraine on the evening of March 6-7 using multiple ships, a sub and 11 Tu-95s,' the retired high-ranking Ukrainian officer told us. The U.S. pause on sharing intelligence with Kyiv 'affects warnings against Russian drones and missiles striking Ukrainian military and civilian targets,' the Kyiv Independent noted.

With this raid Russia, besides terrorizing Ukrainians, is also testing just how far the American suspension of intelligence sharing extends. Mick Ryan, AM (@WarintheFuture) March 7, 2025 As the Institute for the Study of War noted, Ukraine will face a tough choice in which cities to defend should it run out of air defense munitions. As Ukraine runs short on Patriot missiles, Kyiv will have to make difficult decisions about which population centers to prioritize in terms of air defense protection. If it runs out of Patriots entirely, then Ukrainian cities will be open to Russian ballistic missiles.

It's worth noting that French fighters, which arrived in Ukraine just a month ago, took part in the repelling of enemy air strikes for the first time,' the Ukrainian Air Force stated.

The Ukrainian military has relied on this imagery to find Russian troop and equipment concentrations and for battle damage assessments. One of Maxar’s many contracts is with 'GEGD (the Global Enhanced GEOINT Delivery program), a U.S. government program that provides access to commercial satellite imagery that has been tasked and collected by the U.S. government,' company spokesperson Gia DeHart told us in a statement.

'We have intelligence resources that we are providing to the Ukrainians,' Lecornu said on air on France Inter. In addition, as we have reported in the past, Ukraine has a crowd-funded contract with the Finnish ICEYE satellite company. Last June, Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR) said that more than 1,500 Russian targets worth billions of dollars were destroyed thanks to imagery from the ICEYE satellite system. Because the contact was between individuals and ICEYE, it is not affected by the new NGA satellite imagery rules. We reached out to the company to find more details and will update this story with any pertinent information provided. In addition to the Ukrainian military, news organizations have relied on Maxar imagery to gain a better understanding of battlefield conditions and the aftermath of attacks. That imagery will still be available, the company told TWZ. 'No changes to the News Bureau,' DeHart explained.

'It resulted from a series of meetings at the White House on Monday between Mr. Trump and his senior national security aides,' the publication stated, citing anonymous officials.

'Sky Shield, its proponents argue, would be a European-led air protection zone operated separately from NATO to halt Russian cruise missile and drone attacks on cities and infrastructure, potentially operating as part of the 'truce in the sky' proposed by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, this week,' the publication noted. 'It would cover Ukraine’s three operating nuclear power plants and the cities of Odesa and Lviv, but not the frontline or the east of the country – and, according to a newly published paper, it could 'achieve greater military, political, and socioeconomic impact than 10,000 European ground troops.’' The cost and ability to field such a large and sustained aerial air defense force is somewhat questionable, especially without the United States. In the past, similar no-fly-zones and air defense concepts have been outright avoided for Ukraine due to fears of escalation by putting NATO assets directly into the conflict.

'The size of Ukraine, and the extensive front line, spanning over 750 miles (1200 kilometers) can lead one to presume that the requirements for a force are beyond the means of NATO’s European militaries,' they argue. 'Yet what Ukraine needs is not a traditional peacekeeping or separation force which has to be stretched along the line of contact. As such, it’s not about the size of the front. Although European leaders may call it a 'peacekeeping' force, this is not going to be a traditional U.N. peacekeeping mission. The force would serve two functions. First, assure Ukraine. With Western backing, Ukraine should be able to maintain a force sufficient to man, or patrol, key sectors of the front line. Second, enhance deterrence against future aggression from Russia through both the capability deployed and the inherent risk of directly engaging Western forces.'

X-37B Returns To Earth, Space Force Won’t Commit To Buying More	After 434 days, the U.S. Space Force’s secretive X-37B mini-shuttle has completed its seventh mission, returning to Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, at 2:22 a.m. EST today. The Orbital Test Vehicle-7 (OTV-7) mission was the first launch on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy Rocket — meaning that the X-37B could be placed in a much higher orbit than on previous missions, as TWZ previously explored. OTV-7 was also the first mission to use a highly elliptical orbit. At this point, however, the Space Force has said it won’t buy any more X-37Bs beyond the two now in use. The U.S. Space Force’s X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle Mission Seven successfully landed at Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, on March 7, 2025. U.S. Space Force courtesy photo VELOZ ALEXANDER OTV-7 was launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on December 28, 2023. 'While on orbit, Mission 7 accomplished a range of test and experimentation objectives intended to demonstrate the X-37B’s robust maneuver capability while helping characterize the space domain through the testing of space domain awareness technology experiments,' the Space Force said. The Space Force released few details of what the X-37B got up to on its latest mission, which is very much in keeping with the level of classification that surrounds the program. However, OTV-7 included operating the reusable spaceplane 'in new orbital regimes.' As such, the mission took the X-37B beyond the so-called geostationary orbit (GEO) belt around the Earth, as you can read more about here. Orbits that take spacecraft beyond the GEO belt — which is defined as being around 22,236 miles (35,786 kilometers) above sea level — are categorized as high-Earth orbits (HEO). A graphic depicting the major different orbits around our planet, from low-Earth orbit (LEO), via medium-Earth orbit (MEO), to geostationary orbit (GEO). Sedrubal via Wikimedia Commons As previously noted, OTV-7 involved taking the X-37B for the first time on a highly elliptical orbit (confusingly, also known as HEO). The egg-shaped HEO trajectory allows the spaceplane to maneuver itself once it’s close enough to the atmosphere. This is especially advantageous when it comes to keeping potential adversaries guessing as to where the X-37B is since the spaceplane can reappear unexpectedly in orbit. 'We know that that drives them nuts, and I’m really glad about that,' former Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson said back in 2019 in reference to the HEO trajectory. Another view of the U.S. Space Force’s X-37B OTV-7 after it successfully landed at Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, on March 7, 2025. U.S. Space Force courtesy photo VELOZ ALEXANDER In its statement today, the Space Force referred to the importance of the series of aerobraking maneuvers, used for the first time, which 'demonstrated the agile and flexible capabilities the X-37B provides.' Specifically, aerobraking is used to change the orbit of the spaceplane while expending minimal fuel. Aerobraking involves the spaceplane using the drag of the atmosphere, over the course of multiple passes, to dip into low-Earth orbit (LEO), during which it can separate from its service module. 'Mission 7 broke new ground by showcasing the X-37B’s ability to flexibly accomplish its test and experimentation objectives across orbital regimes. The successful execution of the aerobraking maneuver underscores the U.S. Space Force’s commitment to pushing the bounds of novel space operations in a safe and responsible manner,' said Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman In a recent interview with Aviation Week, Saltzman also confirmed that the aerobraking maneuver was used to evaluate the Space Force’s Space Surveillance Network, a collection of optical and radar sensors used to detect, track, identify, and catalog all human-made objects in orbit. The Space Force’s statement today also referred to the fact that Mission 7 included 'space domain awareness technology experiments that aim to improve the United States Space Force’s knowledge of the space environment.'

The service’s Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program, or GSSAP, is intended to achieve just this, and you can read more about it here. 'These technologies are critical to the U.S. Space Force’s ability to conduct space operations in an increasingly congested and contested environment of space, to the benefit of all users of the domain,' the service added, in reference to space domain awareness experiments. Other features of OTV-7 include the first release of a photo of Earth taken by an X-37B. In fact, this was likely the first in-orbit shot from the craft of any kind to be officially released by the Pentagon. The image of Earth was taken 'while conducting experiments in a highly elliptical orbit,' and the camera itself is primarily used to 'ensure the health and safety of the vehicle,' the Space Force said. You can read more about it here. Earth, seen from the perspective of the X-37B’s onboard camera, during its now-completed seventh mission. U.S. Space Force Courtesy Photo At the Air & Space Forces Association’s 2025 Warfare Symposium this week, the Space Force told TWZ: 'Any future plans to build additional platforms beyond the two existing test vehicles will be evaluated based upon the nation’s need.' The Space Force has also said it has no plans to use the X-37B as an operational vehicle, but the various experiments it has been carrying out will feed into any potential future U.S. spaceplane designs. At the same time, the current two-ship X-37B fleet will also provide a better understanding of how adversaries could use similar systems. In particular, China has been busy testing a spaceplane, named Shenlong (meaning Divine Dragon), which is thought to be broadly comparable to the X-37B. In the meantime, the X-37B has continued to conduct its highly classified missions, with the high level of classification fueling speculation about its potential use as space-based intelligence, reconnaissance, and surveillance (ISR) or weapons platform. What we know for sure is that the X-37Bs are assigned to the Space Force’s main unit tasked with 'orbital warfare,' meaning they have an explicit military role. Notably, the X-37B that returned to Vandenberg today was wearing U.S. Space Force markings, rather than those of the U.S. Air Force, which had been applied during the previous OTV-6 mission. The X-37B used on the OTV-6 mission on the flight line at the Kennedy Space Center after its return to Earth on November 12, 2022. U.S. Air Force This change may well also reflect a growing effort to communicate to the public about the importance of space to military operations (and daily life) and potential threats outside of the Earth’s atmosphere, as well as what the U.S. government is doing about those issues. Nevertheless, there is much more that we don’t know about the X-37B than has been revealed to the public. The OTV-7 mission accomplishments are already being praised in terms of milestones in a new orbital regime, the novel aerobraking maneuver, and the testing of space domain awareness experiments. Certainly, however, there are many more significant achievements from OTV-7 that will remain under a veil of secrecy.

B-21 Aerial Refueling Demands Further Point To It Being A Stealth...	The U.S. Air Force's vision for employing its future B-21 Raiders includes new requirements around refueling the stealth bombers in flight. The B-21, which is still deep in development, is expected to have an extremely long unrefueled range thanks to very large internal fuel capacity, a highly efficient airframe, and advanced engines. The disclosure of the Raider's aerial refueling demands comes amid uncertainty about the Air Force plans for new stealthy tankers as part of its Next-Generation Air-Refueling System (NGAS) effort. Air Force Gen. Randall Reed, head of U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM), talked about the B-21's aerial refueling requirements while testifying before members of the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this week. Aviation Week was first to report on Reed's comments. 'As the B-21 bomber enters service, which will modernize and increase our bomber fleet, we must also ensure that we have an adequate tanker fleet to support this platform and the important missions it will perform. I understand that the Air Force will make the ultimate decision on its tanker acquisition strategy, but I'd like to better understand how TRANSCOM is working with the Air Force to communicate its requirements. Are you expressing your needs to the Air Force on what you need to support a nuclear bomber force so that it remains effective and a credible deterrent globally?' Senator Deb Fischer, a Nebraska Republican, asked Reed. B-21 in flight (Northrop Grumman) 'Yes, Senator. Just within the last month, my staff and I took a trip to U.S. STRATCOM [U.S. Strategic Command], and we sat down with the commander there and his staff to hold warfighter talks. During that time, we described what it is that he's called to do so that we can more efficiently and effectively understand how we need to be there with him,' Reed said in response. 'During that same time, we got a really deep understanding in terms of how they plan to employ their new aircraft, and that will drive a slightly different way in which we are to support them, which actually means that it's going to be a little bit higher requirement, specifically in the fuel transfer.' 'As a result, he [STRACOM head Air Force Gen. Anthony Cotton] and I are both working together to go to the service to explain to them what's, what's required, and what's expected in order for us to work together to get that done,' Reed added. The TRANSCOM head did not provide any more granular details about the aerial refueling requirements to support future B-21 operations. It is unclear whether Gen. Reed's comment about a 'bit higher requirement, specifically in the fuel transfer' has to do with the specific rate at which tankers dispense fuel, total fuel capacity available for transfer, or both. When it comes to fuel transfer rate, Aviation Week's report noted that 'guidelines set by the international Air Refueling Systems Advisory Group call for refueling booms to support a transfer rate up to 1,200 gal. per minute, an amount equivalent to about 8,000 lb. of JP-8 jet fuel.' 'The B-21’s weight and fuel capacity are not known, but the bomber’s size is generally considered around two-thirds the mass of a B-2A,' that outlet's story added. 'A single B-2A can carry up to 167,000 lb. of fuel. Assuming a 1,200 gal. per minute transfer rate, it could take about 17 min. for a KC-46 to completely refill 80% of the fuel capacity of a B-2A.' A B-2A Spirit stealth bomber seen from the boom operator's position at the rear of a US Air Force tanker. USAF The time any tanker and receiver are linked together creates additional vulnerabilities for both aircraft. Stealthy platforms like the B-21 face additional risks of detection when getting gas from non-stealthy refuelers. The Raider's design could help mitigate those issues by being able to refuel further away from enemy air defense networks, but the range at which those threats can reach is also increasing. The distance at which detection of non-stealthy aircraft is possible will only increase even more rapidly with each passing year. Increasing the transfer rate also just means that more gas can be offloaded without increasing the total time needed for a refueling window. Altogether, reducing the total time it takes to fill up the Raider's cavernous tanks could be a point of interest to the Air Force. More importantly, the total amount of fuel the B-21 can hold could also create additional overall aerial refueling capacity demands. A force of Raiders could require a uniquely large group of tankers to support their operations compared to other types. The Air Force and TRANSCOM have been warning for years now about aerial refueling shortfalls due in part to growing peacetime demands. By procuring tankers with greater fuel capacity tailored to the B-21's needs and common mission profiles, less tankers could be needed to refuel B-21s on their global missions, freeing assets up for other taskings or just getting by with an overall smaller force. (Northrop Grumman) Northrop Grumman Existing Air Force bombers already fly marathon sorties that can last more than a day and, as already noted, the B-21 is expected to be capable of substantially longer endurance operations than the B-2. These will likely include extreme endurance non-bomber mission sets, like reconnaissance and networking support, as well as other mission types in the future. As TWZ has explored in detail in the past, the Raider's overall design is optimized for efficient, high-altitude, long-range flight. This includes truncated internal weapons bays compared to the B-2 to help provide for greater internal fuel capacity, despite its overall smaller design. In other words, the aircraft has been optimized for extreme range operations and is very much a flying stealthy gas tank due to these requirements.

'I have to ask Jill to bring the most highly-efficient engine to the B-21 because I have to sip gas, and I have to go a long ways with very, very heavy weights,' Maj. Gen. Ty Neuman, Director of Strategic Plans, Programs and Requirements at Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), said during a panel discussion on next-generation aircraft at the Air & Space Forces Association's (AFA) 2025 Warfare Symposium on Wednesday. Jill in this case was Jill Albertelli, President for Military Engines at Pratt & Whitney, who was another one of the panelists. The first pre-production B-21 Raider seen during a test flight. USAF 'The B-21 is fundamentally changing the dynamics of warfighting and how we think about it. We're building an all-aspect penetrating platform that has the range, access, and payload to meet the threat of not only today, but into the future,' Neuman said during that same panel discussion. 'We're building it in such a way that it's going to be adaptable. It's going to be adaptable with its open system architecture. It's going to be adaptable to comm[unications] and networking. And it's going to be adaptable to an entire family of systems, of weapons, sensors, platforms, com, space, you name it.' With B-21, 'we're bringing in and developing the most complex&#8230; weapon load out that we've ever seen in the history of warfare in one platform at the same time,' Neuman added. 'So think conventional-nuclear integration, think electronic attack, electronic warfare, all those types of things being all packaged into one [platform]. That's the type of technology and stuff that this is bringing to bear.' The first pre-production B-21 on the ground. USAF Neuman's remarks underscore that the B-21 is much more than just a bomber, as TWZ regularly highlights. The aircraft is also just one part of a larger Long-Range Strike (LRS) family of systems, details about which remain heavily classified, as you can learn more about here. The LRS ecosystem does include the forthcoming nuclear-armed and stealthy Long Range Stand Off (LRSO) cruise missile. The B-21 is also still making its way through the final phases of development ahead of its expected entry into operational service later this decade. 'I'm very pleased with where we are, both in terms of cadence and performance,' Tom Jones, Executive Vice President and President of the Aeronautics Sector at Northrop Grumman, the company responsible for the B-21, another member of Wednesday's panel at the AFA Warfare Symposium, said. 'We're able to turn around a first serial number aircraft, fly multiple times a week, which I think bodes very well for making this a daily flyer, which is something we promised from the beginning. I think that cadence also speaks a little bit to you know, there's discovery [of issues] in every test program, but to date, if you're able to fly at that cadence, it's an indication that the discovery is not at a significant level.' The Air Force is currently conducting flight testing using the first pre-production B-21. Five other pre-production B-21s are in various stages of construction. A pair of non-flying airframes are also being used to support the going test work. USAF 'In terms of performance, our tests continue to match closely with our digital data. We've talked a lot over the last several years about our digital engineering models, where we have models that we're looking for tight correlation,' Jones continued. 'We're seeing very good correlation. There's other places where we maybe modeled a little bit of extra margin in to make sure that we had the performance we needed. And we're seeing good margin in the places that we model margin.' 'Before we ever even got to first flight, we had more than 200 flights on the flying testbed with over 1,000 flight hours where we're able to exercise hardware, software, sensors, navigation, communication suites,' he added. 'So after you get into the mission systems integration, that's usually a lot of places where you can get a lot of discovery. We've got 1,000 hours plus of discovery and mission systems integration behind us, which I think bodes very well for where we're going overall.' Jones did not provide any more details about this testbed platform, which was also mentioned in, but not elaborated on in a recent Northrop Grumman B-21 press release. TWZ has reached out to the company for more information. This is most likely a reference to the firm's G550 test platform that is thought to have been deeply involved in B-21-related testing. Clandestine test articles related to the program could also exist. N99NG, a Northrop Grumman Gulfstream V testbed returning to Palmdale after flying in Nevada airspace.

Don Bacon (@RepDonBacon) February 26, 2025 Separate from the B-21 program, but intertwined with it, especially with the news about the Raider's aerial refueling needs, there is also the matter of the Air Force's NGAS initiative. NGAS has also been shaping up to be a system of next-generation aerial refueling capabilities, the centerpiece of which could be new stealthy tankers, but its future is murky. 'On the air refueling side of the house, we've done a lot of work on analysis of alternatives for the Next Generation Air-Refueling System, effectively known as NGAS,' Air Force Gen. John Lamontagne, head of Air Mobility Command (AMC), said during a separate panel talk at the AFA Warfare Symposium on Wednesday. 'That work has – most of that [has] been submitted to OSD [the Office of the Secretary of Defense]. We're following up with a couple finishing touches here over the next month or two. And it effectively looks at sort of the trade offs between how big does the runway need to be, how much fuel can you deliver at range, and then signature management for how far we can go forward into the threat environment and the trade offs across those three.' A rendering of a notional stealth tanker. Lockheed Martin Skunk Works The Air Force has also been exploring other options for improved and expanding aerial refueling capabilities and capacity, and making them more survivable in higher-threat areas. This includes new podded boom-equipped systems that fighter-sized aircraft could carry. A big question for NGAS, as well as other top-priority Air Force modernization efforts, remains cost. Serious concerns emerged last year about whether the service could afford to buy stealthy tankers, as well as new sixth-generation crewed stealth combat jets and Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones being developed under the Next-Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative. A deep review of the NGAD combat jet plans, which are currently paused, concluded that acquiring at least some number of those aircraft will be critical to ensuring the Air Force can best provide air superiority with the lowest amount of risk, especially in future high-end fights. The billions of dollars required to pay for that could then eat into other efforts like NGAS. A rendering of a notional sixth-generation crewed stealth combat jet. Collins Aerospace The Air Force has already been contending with the ballooning costs of the Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) program. The Department of Defense under Secretary Pete Hedgeth is also now looking for existing programs to cut to free up billions of dollars in funding for new Trump administration priorities like the Golden Dome missile defense initiative. An ongoing debate over the optimal size of the B-21 fleet presents its own budgetary implications. The current plan is to buy at least 100 Raiders, but there has been talk of increasing that figure. 'I would contend it's not just an Air Force decision when it comes down to the actual quantity,' Maj. Gen. Neuman said on Wednesday about the B-21 fleet size debate. 'The capabilities that we're developing and fielding on the B-21, that is a national mission, it's actually a force enabler, force multiplier, for the entire joint force. And if we're going to spend the time and energy to get after this and then produce more than what we have on record right now, the nation is going to have to be like, 'Yes, this is where we're going to go. This is the future.'' However many B-21s the Air Force ultimately acquired, the Raider is set to have significant impacts on the service's force structure and how it operates going forward, including when it comes to the bomber's now-disclosed unique aerial refueling demands.

This Is How The Military Wants AI To Help Control America’s Nucle...	While it has long been a world-ending threat in science fiction, U.S. Air Force and Space Force officials see artificial intelligence (AI) playing important, if not critical roles in the command and control enterprise at the heart of America's nuclear deterrent capabilities. AI has the potential to help speed up decision making cycles and ensure that orders get where they need to go as fast and securely as possible. It could also be used to assist personnel charged with other duties from intelligence processing to managing maintenance and logistics. The same officials stress that humans will always need to be in or at least on the loop, and that a machine alone will never be in a position to decide to employ nuclear weapons. A group of officers from the Air Force and Space Force talked about how AI could be used to support what is formally called the Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) architecture during a panel discussion at the Air & Space Forces Association's 2025 Warfare Symposium, at which TWZ was in attendance. The current NC3 enterprise consists of a wide array of communications and other systems on the surface, in the air, and in space designed to ensure that a U.S. nuclear strike can be carried out at any time regardless of the circumstances. A now dated unclassified graphic showing just a portion of the elements that the NC3 enterprise consists of, giving a good sense of its scale and scope. USAF 'If we don't think about AI, and we don't consider AI, then we're going to lose, and I'm not interested in losing,' Maj. Gen. Ty Neuman, Director of Strategic Plans, Programs and Requirements at Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), said yesterday. 'So we absolutely have to figure this out.' 'AI has to be part of what the next generation NC3 [architecture] is going to look like. We have to be smart about how we use that technology,' Neuman continued. 'Certainly the speed is probably the most critical thing. There's going to be so much data out there, and with digital architectures, resilient architectures, and things like that, we have to take advantage of the speed at which we can process data.' Neuman also outlined a role for AI to help with secure communications. 'The way I would envision this actually being in the comm world, would be using AI to – if a message is being sent or a communication is being sent from the National Command Authority to a shooter, AI should be able to determine what is the fastest and most secure pathway for me to get that message from the decision maker to the shooter,' the general explained. 'As a human operator on a comm system in today's world, I will not have the ability to determine what is the most secure and safest pathway, because there's going to be, you know, signals going in 100 different directions. Some may be compromised. Some may not be compromised. I will not be able to determine that, so AI has to be part of that.' The National Command Authority is the mechanism through which the President of the United States would order a nuclear strike, a process you can read more about in detail here. America's currently has a nuclear triad of 'shooters' consisting of B-2 and B-52 bombers, silo-based Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), and Ohio class ballistic missile submarines. Air Force F-15E Strike Eagle combat jets, as well as at least some F-35A Joint Strike Fighter and F-16 Viper fighters, can also carry B61 tactical nuclear bombs. A graphic offering a very basic look at the elements of the NC3 architecture, as well as the 'shooters' of the current nuclear triad. DOD AI could be valuable in the NC3 enterprise beyond helping with decision making and communications, as well. 'We can analyze historical data and identify trends, and those AI tools could be used in a predictive manner. We could use it on our systems to proactively manage just like our system maintenance, be able to plan the upgrades to the system, and reducing the risks to unexpected interruptions or disruptions,' Space Force Col. Rose, Deputy Director for Military Communications and Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) at Space Systems Command, another one of the panelists, said. 'Additionally, the data or trends related to cybersecurity, or being able to see what our adversaries are up to, could also be useful for decision makers.' Though made just in passing, Rose's comment about cybersecurity offers a notable point about how AI could be useful for helping to defend networks like the NC3 architecture, both within the cyber domain and across the radiofrequency (RF) spectrum. The nuclear decision-making space has always been one with short timetables, including when it comes to securely disseminating nuclear strike orders. For decades now, it has been understood that the President will have at best tens of minutes, if not substantially less, to explore available courses of action and pick one or more to execute once an incoming nuclear threat has been spotted and positively identified. Many of those courses of action would only be viable within certain time windows and any disruption in the decision-making process would have devastating consequences. There are also already efforts to integrate AI-driven capabilities into other decision-making spaces, including at the tactical level, across the Department of Defense. AI tools are already being used to help monitor domestic airspace and processing intelligence, as well as assist with maintenance, logistics, and other sustainment-related functions. At the same time, there have been concerns about the accuracy of the models that underpin existing AI-driven capabilities and the idea of automating anything to do with nuclear weapons is particularly sensitive. Science fiction and other ends of popular culture are also full of stories where turning over aspects of America's nuclear deterrent arsenal to a machine leads an apocalypse or risks doing so. The 1983 movie WarGames and the Terminator franchise – starting with the eponymous film in 1984, but better emphasized by the opening scene to the 1991 sequel Terminator 2: Judgment Day 2 – are prime examples. The panelists yesterday acknowledged the concerns about integrating AI into the NC3 architecture specifically. 'When we think about nuclear enterprise and our nuclear capabilities, as well as the assured comm[unications] that we absolutely have to have, we have to have a human in the loop. As good as AI is, as good as computer process and things like that could be, it's really only as good as the data that is fed into it,' Maj. Gen. Neuman said. 'Therefore, if the data is corrupted, then we have no way of actually determining whether the data or the output is actually there. So, therefore, we absolutely have to have the human in the loop there.' 'The human, the loop should really just be, you know, there to inform and make sure that the data that's being transmitted is exactly right,' he also said. 'I think it's important to push the boundaries of AI, and deliver innovative solutions that are reliable and trustworthy, but I also recognize that the integration of AI, specifically in NC3 systems, presents some challenges and risks,' Col. Rose added. 'I think that with robust testing, validation, and implementing oversight mechanisms, I think we can find a way to mitigate some of those risks and challenges, and ultimately deliver AI systems that operate as they're intended.' 'I would just foot stomp to those people that are maybe not as familiar with this mission space: while we do need everything we just talked about, there will always be a human making the decision on whether to employ this weapon, and that human will be the President United States,' Air Force Lt. Gen. Andrew Gebara, Deputy Chief of Staff for Strategic Deterrence and Nuclear Integration, who was also on yesterday's panel, stressed. 'So for those of you that are concerned out there, don't be concerned about that. There will always be that human in the loop.' It is worth noting that yesterday's panel was hardly the first time U.S. military officials have publicly advocated for integrating AI into nuclear operations. 'We are also developing artificial intelligence or AI-enabled human-led decision support tools to ensure our leaders are able to respond to complex, time-sensitive scenarios,' Air Force Gen. Anthony Cotton, head of U.S. Strategic Command (STRACOM), said in a keynote address at the 2024 Department of Defense Intelligence Information System worldwide conference last October. 'By processing vast amounts of data, providing actionable insights and enabling better informed and more timely decisions, AI will enhance our decision-making capabilities, but we must never allow artificial intelligence to make those decisions for us. Advanced systems can inform us faster and more efficiently, but we must always maintain a human decision in the loop.' Air Force Gen. Anthony Cotton, head of U.S. Strategic Command (STRACOM). DOD Staff Sgt. Eugene Oliver Cotton elaborated further on this during a talk the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) think tank hosted in November 2024. 'If we think that United States Strategic Command can't take advantage of artificial intelligence to preserve the terabytes of data that would otherwise hit the floor, and still do things the old fashioned way, as far as, not decision making, but planning efforts, efficiencies, then we might as well &#8230; move out of the beautiful building we have and just go into something that has rotary phones,' he said. 'I [would] much rather have an opportunity, if asked for the, you know, by the President – for example, the President says, 'well, here's what I want you to do' – I [would] much rather say, 'well, Mr. President, hold on. I'll get back to you in a couple of hours, and we'll talk about how we can execute that',' Cotton continued. 'You know, it would be much nicer for me to be able to kind of go, 'Yes, Mr. President, give me a couple of minutes, and we'll come back to you with some options.' That's what I'm talking about, right?' 'You know, in WarGames, it has this machine called the WOPR [War Operation Plan Response, pronounced 'whopper']. So, the WOPR actually was that AI machine that everyone is scared about. And guess what? We do not have, you know, a WOPR in STRATCOM headquarters. Nor would we ever have a WOPR in STRATCOM headquarters,' Cotton added. 'That's not what I'm talking about. What I'm talking about is, how do I, you know, how do I get and become efficient on ISR [intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance] products, you know? How do I get, you know, efficient on understanding what's the status of my forces? You know, those are things that AI and machine learning can absolutely help us and really shave a lot of time off on being able to do those type of things.' Whether or not the assurances like this, or those from Gebara, Neuman, and Rose yesterday, about a human always being in the loop will allay concerns about the use of AI in the NC3 architecture remains to be seen. What is clear is that this discussion is not going away any time soon.

NATO Operations Chief’s Five Lessons Learned From War In Ukraine	NATO is turning to the ongoing war in Ukraine for lessons as the alliance works to shift its strategy going forward. Tom Goffus, NATO’s Assistant Secretary General for Operations, presented five such lessons during a panel this week at the Air and Space Forces (AFA) Air Warfare Symposium in Aurora, CO. 'I got to NATO one month before the invasion, so [I had a] front row seat watching the whole thing,' Goffus told the audience. 'I think it's a critical topic.' Prior to that, Goffus, a former U.S. Air Force F-15 pilot, served as Policy Director on the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for European and NATO Policy, National Security Staff Director for Strategic and Eastern European Affairs, and Senior Military Advisor for European and Eurasian Affairs at the State Department. Before unveiling his own takeaways, Goffus talked about the value of Ukraine’s acoustic sensor network for the detection of low-altitude detection of drones and cruise missiles. 'Essentially, Ukraine is covering its entire nation, 1,000 meters and below, with acoustic sensors for less than 50 million euros (nearly $54 million),' Goffus gushed. 'It's crazy what they're doing with this.' The Zvook acoustic detection system was showcased during the Ukrainian Brave1 tech platform on April 26, 2023. (Brave1) @Dankihot / (dankihot.com) That system is among many things being examined by NATO’s new lessons learned center, called the Joint Analysis Training and Education Center (JATEC). 'We just opened the lessons learned center in Bydgoszcz, Poland,' Goffus explained. 'It's the first NATO and Ukraine-run organization that we have. We don't have any other partners that run an organization like this. It will be under [Supreme Allied Commander Transformation] (SACT), but there will also be a civilian element to it. I'll have some of my people there working for the commander on the ground for unity of command, but that's going to be a vehicle for more of these.' Goffus then offered up five lessons learned from this war. Lesson 1: 'Collective action rests on the foundation of shared awareness, and it takes real work to achieve that shared awareness,' he said. 'And unlike in 2014, where ambassadors were arguing they're looking at pictures, saying, ‘see the Russians are in Crimea,’ and the next ambassador would say, ‘No, that looks like 100 to me.’ And as a result, we didn't do anything because we didn't have shared awareness of what was going on. Our 2022 response could not have more been more different than the 2014 response, in primary part, due to shared intelligence among allies, especially from the U.S.' A man looks at a Russian T-72 tank destroyed during Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

It's what we don't do. We should have learned that in 2014, and that's lesson number three.' Lesson 3: 'Putin is not a strategist. He's an opportunist. He pushes on some doors, and when nobody pushes back, he walks in. What 2014 taught him was that there was no significant consequence for using force. It invited Putin's 2022 invasion, in my opinion. In his own words, Putin believes that, quote, 'a serious, irreconcilable struggle is unfolding for the formation of a new world order.' And that's lesson number four.'' Russian President Vladimir Putin attends the parade on the 79th anniversary of the Victory Day in Red Square in Moscow, Russia, on May 09, 2024. (Photo by Kremlin Press Service/Anadolu via Getty Images) Anadolu Lesson 4: 'We are in a strategic confrontation. I believe our Australian friends are [seeing] the same [Chinese Premier] Xi [Jingping] dynamic in the Indo-Pacific. Putin explicitly said he'll use crisis and conflict during peace to win the strategic confrontation. Peace, crisis, conflict used to be a sequence, part of our model. Now, it's a spectrum. As NATO Secretary General [Mark] Rutte said, ‘we are not at war, but we are certainly not at peace either.' Lesson 5: 'We are woefully under-invested in our transatlantic defense industrial base to produce the capabilities we need at pace and at scale. Russia, with an economy 5% the size of NATO, produces in three months many critical munitions that it takes 32 allies an entire year to produce. I know I'm not making friends amongst the industry at this point, but something is very wrong here, and we must fix it.' Goffus expanded on that last lesson. The defense industrial base has 'not been this important in a long time,' he explained, adding that the U.S. has to step up its capacity to produce weapons. Lithuania wants 'to buy AMRAAMS for their NASAMS,' he stated. 'Five-year wait. I talked to the Bulgarian CHOD [Chief of Defense]. They want to buy Javelins for their Strykers. Seven-year wait. I talked to some of the big allies who want to buy Patriots. 10-year wait. That needs to get fixed.' NASAMS firing an AIM-120. (Kongsberg Defense) It’s one thing to learn lessons. It’s something else entirely to change the 32-nation alliance's strategic approach. This may become more of a challenge in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump’s growing relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the chilling relations between some NATO members and the United States. On the other hand, new opportunities for breakthroughs on some of these items could be had in the wake of the current sea change in cross-Atlantic relations. Regardless, Ukraine has served as stress test for the alliance and the military thinking and industrial base that underpins it, and clearly the major takeaways are being taken to heart by those at the top of NATO's command hierarchy.

Houthi Weapons Arsenal Remains A Mystery To The U.S.	The U.S. remains puzzled about how many weapons the Houthis have or where they get them all, a senior U.S. defense official told The War Zone, adding that the militants are highly innovative when it comes to developing their arsenal. Meanwhile, numerous airstrikes by the U.S. and its allies on Houthi targets in Yemen have not halted the rebel group’s ability to produce the weapons and use them at will, the official said. 'There's some debate as to what's in their magazine,' the official told The War Zone during a media engagement at the Air and Space Forces Association Air Warfare Symposium in Aurora, Colorado. 'There's a good bit right now we don't know about the Houthis.' The official spoke a day before the U.S. officially designated Ansar Allah - the official name of the Houthis - as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.

They have forced ships to avoid the Suez Canal for a far longer route around Africa, boosting cargo costs by nearly $200 billion. The Houthis’ attacks sank two vessels, damaged many others, caused the death of four mariners, and led to many being held hostage after a ship was seized. There were also a lot of Houthi weapons that missed their targets entirely. The CHIOS Lion was attacked by the Houthis last July. (Houthi screencap) In response to these attacks, the U.S. and its allies have engaged numerous Houthi missiles and air and sea drones to protect commercial vessels as well as themselves.

U.S. Navy You can read more about the Houthi anti-ship missile arsenal in our in-depth story here. Despite this ongoing fight, the depth and scope of the Houthi arsenal is largely a mystery, stated the official, who offered begrudging respect for the terror group’s weapons development capabilities. 'What I can tell about the Houthis is they iterate, and they're pretty innovative,' the official explained. 'So we see them putting together weapon systems and put them together in ways, give them a try, and a lot of times they fail. But we talk about the military about ‘failing forward’ and being innovative, and with a begrudging tip of the hat to the Houthis, they're actually doing that.' 'We've been surprised at times with some of the things that we see them do, and it makes us scratch our head a little bit,' the official noted, adding that the Houthis are 'not super technologically advanced, but we do think they're pretty innovative.' ©2023, The International Institute for Strategic Studies, originally published on with permission) (International Institute of Strategic Studies) While the extent of the Houthi weapons stocks is unknown, 'we do think that they do a lot of production in-house,' the official told us. 'Our assessment right now is that there's likely some key components and other things that come from Iran or other places, but a lot of the actual production is in Yemen.' The official declined to say what components the Houthis have procured. The Houthi Red Sea campaign led to nearly constant military engagements with the U.S. and its allies, including air strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. The most recent U.S. attack took place on Jan. 8, according to U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM). That’s when CENTCOM’s 'forces conducted multiple precision strikes against two Iranian-backed Houthi underground Advanced Conventional Weapon (ACW) storage facilities within Houthi-controlled territories of Yemen. The Houthis used these facilities to conduct attacks against U.S. Navy warships and merchant vessels in the southern Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.'

'I wouldn't say we've changed their weapons production capabilities, because again, I'll go back to there's still a lot of unknowns right now,' the official mused. 'We knew some of the threats, we know some of the effects that they try and do. And there are some things we're still working on.' The official declined to elaborate. In January, as a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas was announced, the Houthis pledged to halt shipping attacks. There have been none since. According to another U.S. defense official, the last such Houthi attack took place on Dec. 9-10, when U.S. Navy destroyers USS Stockdale and USS O’Kane 'successfully defeated a range of Houthi-launched weapons while transiting the Gulf of Aden,' according to CENTCOM.

'Lebanese Hezbollah clearly has been hurt a great deal by Israel,' the official explained. 'We see militia groups in Iraq right now being less active. And so the one outlier to all of that is the Houthis. You see them very active. There are differing opinions on how much direct control Iran has over the Houthis, but we think that they continue to support them through a lot of different avenues.' On Monday, the Houthis vowed to resume military operations against Israel if the ceasefire breaks down. 'The Yemeni armed forces are ready to resume operations in response to Zionist violations,' Nasr al-Din Amer, deputy head of the Houthis’ Media Authority, said, according to Shafaq News. 'It’s too early to specify the scale of escalation, but at a minimum, Jaffa will be under fire.' It’s unclear if the Houthis will also resume attacking shipping. If they resume standoff attacks on Israel and shipping, it’s unknown how long the Yemen-based militant group can maintain such an operation as their seemingly resilient ability to construct the weapons used in those attacks remains something of a mystery.

Collaborative Combat Drones Designed From Ground Up To Do Combat ...	The U.S. Air Force's new Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones are being developed around fundamentally different understandings of maintenance, logistics, and sustainment, with a heavy focus on commercial-of-the-shelf components, than the service's existing crewed and uncrewed platforms. This is particularly true regarding how CCAs will be supported at forward locations during future conflicts as the drones are the first aircraft designed from the ground up around concepts for distributed and disaggregated operations collectively referred to as Agile Combat Employment (ACE). The Air & Space Forces Association hosted a panel discussion on CCA logistics at its 2025 Warfare Symposium yesterday, at which TWZ was in attendance. Air Force Maj. Gen. Joseph Kunkel, Director of Force Design, Integration, and Wargaming within the office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Air Force Futures, was one of three panelists. The other two were Mike Atwood, Vice President for Advanced Programs at General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. (GA-ASI), and Andrew Van Timmeren, Senior Director of Autonomous Airpower at Anduril Industries. In 2024, the Air Force picked GA-ASI and Anduril to design and build CCA prototypes, now designated YFQ-42A and YFQ-44A, respectively, as part of the program's first phase or Increment 1. Requirements for a second tranche of CCAs, or Increment 2, which could be more costly, are coalescing now. The service expects to buy between 100 and 150 Increment 1 CCAs, but has said in the past that it could ultimately acquire at least a thousand of the drones across all of the program's increments. It remains unclear whether the Air Force plans to buy just YF-42As or YF-44As, or a mix of both, under Increment 1. A composite rendering of the CCA designs that General Atomics, at top, and Anduril, at bottom, are currently developing, along with their new formal designations. General Atomics/Anduril 'We need to think about how we survive and generate combat power from the inside, and how do we strengthen our position on the inside? And part of that is distributed basing,' Kunkel said near the start of yesterday's panel discussion by way of introduction. 'The ability to create multiple dilemmas for our adversaries, &#8230; multiple places where they have to distribute and make choices about whether they're going to target or not, that's a really big deal for us.' 'That distributed basing also creates a lot of inefficiencies in how you might sustain something,' Kundel continued. 'Some of the design attributes that these two teams have been building into their CCAs are exactly that - you don't want to have a huge additional footprint that's required. You don't want to have, like, the big sustainment requirements.' 'You want to be able to use commercial stuff to the max extent [so] you don't have to take specialized refueling equipment, specialized loading equipment' to forward locations, the Air Force's force design boss added. Specialized maintenance and logistics demands, as well as the need for more bespoke equipment on the ground to support flight operations, have been major hurdles for the Air Force when it comes to implementing the ACE concepts using existing crewed and uncrewed aircraft. GA-ASI's Atwood highlighted lessons learned from the Air Force's Rapid Raptor and Rapid Reaper concepts for quickly deploying small force packages of F-22 Raptor stealth fighters and MQ-9 Reaper drones, respectively, along with supporting assets to forward locations. The MQ-9 is another General Atomics product and the company helped in the development of a 'kit' to assist with deploying and sustaining those drones within the ACE construct. This includes using the Reapers themselves to carry their own sustainment kits into a remote locale and to conduct limited resupply missions by carrying small cargoes in travel pods under their wings. A travel pod under the wing of an MQ-9 Reaper. USAF 'So our CCA aircraft uses that pedigree' and has 'a footprint today' that is focused on forward-deployed operations and reducing maintenance demands as much as possible, Atwood said yesterday. 'The best aircraft is the one you don't do maintenance on.' He also highlighted 'condition-based maintenance' concepts leveraging systems on the drones to alert maintainers and help them start ahead of larger issues. The CCA 'should tell you when it's starting to cough a little bit and get sick.' General Atomics' CCA design also incorporates other features to ensure it can operate from more far-flung locations with more limited infrastructure, including shorter and less well-maintained runways. Atwood again used prior experience with the MQ-9 to help illustrate these challenges. 'We showed up at these World War II leftover airfields. And we quickly realized these airfields are in really bad shape, really bad shape, and we started to really appreciate runway distance,' Atwood explained. 'It's hard to make a fast-moving aircraft use a lot less runway. And so what we realized is we needed a trailing-arm landing gear.' A trailing-arm helps smooth the impact of landing, which in turn can help reduce wear and tear. This is especially beneficial for CCAs flying from short and potentially rough fields during future operations. A model of General Atomics CCA design. Jamie Hunter When it comes to Anduril's CCA design, also known as Fury, Van Timmeren talked about how features to make it more readily maintainable in the field, as well as low-maintenance overall, were baked in early on. Van Timmeren, a retired Air Force officer who flew F-22s, previously worked for Blue Force Technologies, which started Fury's development in the late 2010s and was then acquired by Anduril in 2023. You can read the full story of how Fury came to be in this past in-depth TWZ feature. 'Early on, you communicate with your engineering team, not just the performance characteristics of the hardware that you want &#8230; we also want to say everything has to be easily accessible for the design. Everything has to be easily line replaceable,' Van Timmeren said yesterday. 'We have ease of access for all the panels [on Fury].' Another 'one of the things that's critical to the ease of supportability is leveraging as much as possible commercial components. So engines that are flight-certified, already in mass production for the civilian aviation community. Wheels, tires, brakes, hydraulic actuators, all the sub-components that go into a vehicle,' he added, also noting that no bespoke tools are required to do work on Fury. A model of Anduril's Fury. Jamie Hunter A 'perfect example of that actually is the engine [on Fury],' Van Timmeren continued. 'We're using a commercial engine that is in production, is FAA [Federal Aviation Administration] certified, millions of flight hours on it.' Fury is powered by a single Williams International FJ44-4M turbofan engine. FJ44 variants are in widespread use, especially on business jets, including members of the popular Cessna Citation family. Van Timmeren also used the example of needing to replace a blown tire to further illustrate the value of using components more readily available on the commercial market. Bespoke tires for military aircraft can be wildly expensive, as TWZ has reported on in the past. They can also be harder to source overall. If you blow a tire, 'you might have to go out in the community to find it,' Van Timmeren said. Using commercial parts available through global logistics networks means you can 'go to local FBO and buy it,' he added, referring to fixed-base operator/fixed-based operations contractors who provide general aviation support services at airports. TWZ has reported in the past about the serious issues the Air Force has already been facing with spare part supply chains, especially when it comes to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. During yesterday's panel discussion, both General Atomics' Atwood and Anduril's Van Timmeren highlighted the benefits that new and improving manufacturing processes, including 3D printing and other additive manufacturing techniques, are also expected to bring to the CCA sustainment pipeline. Supporting CCA operations, especially at more remote and/or austere forward locations, isn't just about the drones themselves. Maj. Gen. Kunkel had already highlighted these issues just recently at a separate talk the Hudson Institute think tank hosted last week. 'I will tell you, some of it’s not like the sexy, cool stuff. It’s like the basics. It’s like bomb loaders, missile loaders, and, you know, refueling trucks and, you know, electric carts and air conditioning carts,' he said at that time. 'They’ve got to be made differently.' To help in this regard, General Atomics' CCA design features an all-electric start-up capability that requires no off-board support. 'So you can hit a button, the plane will start up, taxi, [and] take off all on its own,' according to Atwood. Any ground support equipment and other assets needed to support CCAs at forward locations also have to be able to get there in the first place with the same level of rapidity. 'I employed the James Bond model. I only want to maintain something that I could jump out of the back of the C-130 with,' Atwood said. 'When you think about the sustainment architectures that we built in the past, the thought was that they were going to be in sanctuary. So, you know, you could afford to build a piece of aircraft ground equipment that weighed 10,000 pounds and wouldn’t fit on a C-130,' Maj. Gen. Kunkel had also noted last week at the Hudson Institute talk. Members of the U Air Force unload lighting carts from a C-130 at Moscow's Vnukovo International Airport in support of President Barack Obama's visit to Russia in 2009. USAF Focusing assets that will fit inside a C-130 or a similarly-sized platform may not be enough to support future CCA operations. 'We use MQ-9 to carry parts between bases, and that's something we've done in the past, and something we'll continue to do,' but 'the concept of logistics, what we need for airlift, is going to change potentially,' Maj. Gen. Kunkel said yesterday. 'And you need a cargo aircraft that can very agilely deliver parts, and deliver weapons, and deliver material to places that are inside.' 'I think CCA can actually be, in some cases, a mobility aircraft,' General Atomics Atwood said, highlighting the internal bay on his company's design. 'One of the reasons that GA chose to have an internal weapons bay was for carrying not just missiles and kinetics, but to do that logistics.' All of this is set to have downstream operational and other impacts across the Air Force. 'So many people think about survivability in the air, in air combat phase, but just as important is survivability on the ground,' General Atomics' Atwood said. The ACE concepts of operations, at their core, are heavily centered on making it difficult for an opponent to target friendly forces on the ground. There also an increasingly heated debate about whether the Air Force, in particular, should be doing more to physically harden its existing main operating bases against attack, as you can read more about here. 'So, minimizing your turn time on the aircraft,' helped by using commercial components and supporting assets, 'gets you to have a turnaround time that is extremely difficult for the adversary' to get its targeting cycle around, Atwood added. Atwood further noted that the often discussed need for more 'affordable mass' to provide the required air combat capacity to win future conflicts could be provided with fewer platforms if they're more survivable, including on the ground, and can be employed at a very high tempo. The General Atomics executive also highlighted the value of increasingly autonomous capabilities in further reducing the required footprint on the ground. 'The other part about autonomy is it takes a [control] van out of it. So I need less deployed footprint, less chow halls, less barracks,' Atwood said. The view inside a ground control station for the MQ-9 Reaper. USAF 'For a number of ways, simplicity eliminates vulnerabilities,' Maj. Gen. Kunkel also said. 'What it also does, it opens up the aperture on where you can actually place these things.' Kunkel noted that CCAs could operate from allied and partner airbases, and even from commercial airports, in addition to fully U.S.-controlled facilities, during future operations. The Air Force has already been using a mix of test aircraft, crewed and uncrewed, to help lay the ground work for its future CCAs, including just how the drones will be integrated into its force structure and day-to-day training and other activities, as well as combat operations. Yesterday, Kunkel noted that his service has established an Experimental Operations Unit (EOU) dedicated to this work at Creech Air Force Base in Nevada. The Air Force announced last year that it would be increasing purchases of prototype Increment 1 CCAs to further help in this regard. CCAs are 'going to be the first aircraft that we have developed specifically for ACE,' Kunkel stressed. 'That's going to be the game changer for us.' For the Air Force to truly get the most out of its future CCA fleets, a new logistics and sustainment ecosystem will be required. General Atomics and Anduril have already been baking those demands into their YFQ-42A and YFQ-44A designs.

South Korean F-16s Just Bombed A Town By Accident	A pair of F-16 fighters operated by the Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF) accidentally bombed a civilian area during a live-fire military exercise today. The incident took place ahead of large-scale joint maneuvers with U.S. forces in South Korea, the first of their kind since U.S. President Donald Trump returned to the White House.

According to the Yonhap news agency, a 60-year-old who had been driving at the time of the incident was left with shrapnel lodged in their neck. There was also extensive damage to buildings in the area, including a church and houses. 'There was a sudden loud roar of a fighter jet, then an explosion rang out. When I went to the scene, there were about four houses that were halved from the damage, people hurt,' Oh Moung-su, a 65-year-old resident, told Reuters. 'Dusk and smoke rose into the sky, water gushed out of a pipe. People in a vehicle going to a construction site were injured — some of them couldn’t even get out of the car.

It was yet to be determined why the second fighter dropped its bombs, the military said, but confirmed that all live-fire exercises had been suspended for the time being.

Republic of Korea Armed Forces BOHYUN PYUN The maneuvers today occurred ahead of planned combined drills involving South Korea and the United States, known as Freedom Shield. These are the first of their kind under the new Trump administration and are due to run from March 10 to 20. South Korean military officials say today’s incident will not affect this schedule. All of this comes at a time when South Korea and the United States are increasingly concerned about the deepening military alliance between North Korea and Russia. Against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine, North Korea has emerged as a key backer for Moscow, providing troops as well as millions of rounds of ammunition and other weaponry. According to South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), the Freedom Shield drills will reflect 'lessons learned from recent armed conflicts' and North Korea’s expanding partnership with Russia.

Photo by Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images Chung Sung-Jun Incidents involving live-fire exercises in South Korea are also not unheard of. During a joint U.S.-South Korea drill in 2022, a short-range ballistic missile was launched and malfunctioned, crashing into a golf course at a military base. The warhead didn’t detonate, but there was a significant fire. On other occasions, stray munitions have landed near civilian residences in South Korea but have rarely caused injuries. In 2004, a ROKAF F-5B mistakenly released a practice bomb over Boryeong, 85 miles south of Seoul, but no one was harmed. In this latest case, it is especially alarming since these were live weapons — a full 4,000 pounds nominal weight in total — that detonated in a city with a population of around 140,000. There is also the fact that this occurred in close proximity to the North Korean border. Certainly, the results could have been much worse in terms of both civilian casualties and repercussions. While the South Korean military insists that today’s incident will not affect the Freedom Shield drills, it will undoubtedly raise questions about the relative safety of live-fire exercises on the peninsula. In that sense, the timing is especially unfortunate for Seoul, as it prepares to begin the first large-scale joint maneuvers with the U.S. military under the new Trump administration, at a time of raised tensions with the North.

USAF Generals Downplay Calls For More Hardened Aircraft Shelters ...	U.S. Air Force officials remain focused on the ability to disperse forces to far-flung operating locations as the primary means of reducing vulnerability to enemy attacks. They also continue to downplay any talk of doing more to physically harden existing bases. This is despite acknowledgments that large established facilities are still expected to play key roles in any future conflict and can no longer be considered sanctuaries. All of this comes amid an increasingly heated debate about whether the entire U.S. military should be investing in new hardened aircraft shelters and other similar infrastructure improvements, which TWZ has been following closely. Air Force Gen. Kevin Schneider, head of Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), the service's top command in the Indo-Pacific region, spoke yesterday about current 'resilient' basing priorities during a panel discussion at the Air & Space Forces Association’s (AFA) 2025 Warfare Symposium, at which TWZ was in attendance. The panel's main topic was Agile Combat Employment (ACE), a term that currently refers to a set of concepts for distributed and disaggregated operations centered heavily on short notice and otherwise irregular deployments, often to remote, austere, or otherwise non-traditional locales. The other branches of the U.S. military, especially the U.S. Marine Corps, have been developing similar new concepts of operations. 'So the Air Force wants to populate the Indo-Pacific with dispersed operating locations to support ACE. However, the Air Force also needs to invest heavily in resilient infrastructure at its main operating bases,' Heather 'Lucky' Penney, the panel's moderator, said as a lead in to a question. 'So, General Schneider, could you speak to what the Air Force is doing to balance the demand for resilient infrastructure while also building out ACE operating locations across the Indo-Pacific?' Penney is currently a senior fellow at AFA's Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies and also an Air Force veteran who flew F-16s. 'It's different in the Indo-Pacific than it is in Europe. [We] do not have NATO. You have a couple of – five bilateral treaty partners. Two of them are Korea and Japan where we share basing,' Schneider said in response. 'We also have the joint force demands on our bases. And their are benefits to that, as well. I like having the Army on our bases, especially when they have Patriots [surface-to-air missile systems] and other capability that helps us defend.' Elements of a US Army Patriot surface-to-air missile battery at Osan Air Base in South Korea, which the Air Force also operates from. US Army It's worth noting here that currently the U.S. Army is the lead service for providing air and missile defense for Air Force bases at home and abroad. There has been talk recently about the Air Force potentially taking a greater role in this regard. The Army has been facing its own struggles in meeting growing demand for ground-based air and missile defenses. 'So, we will have the need for bases, the main operating bases from which we operate,' the PACAF commander continued. 'The challenge becomes, at some point, we will need to move to austere locations. We will need to disaggregate the force. We will need to operate out of other locations, again, one for survivability, and two, again, to provide response options.' Ensuring the continued viability of main operating bases and work related to ACE both 'cost money,' he said. The Air Force is then faced with the need to 'make internal trades' funding-wise, such as 'do we put that dollar towards, you know, fixing the infrastructure at Kadena [Air Base in Japan] or do we put that dollar towards restoring an airfield at Tinian,' according to Schneider. What Gen. Schneider was referring to at the end here is the massive amount of work that has been done to reclaim North Field on the island of Tinian, a U.S. territory in the Western Pacific, since the end of 2023. North Field was originally built as a huge B-29 bomber base during World War II. It was the biggest active airbase anywhere in the world before being largely abandoned after the war ended. There has also been additional expansion of the available facilities at Tinian International Airport in recent years, ostensibly to improve its ability to serve as a divert location for U.S. military aircraft in the event that the critically strategic Andersen Air Force Base on nearby Guam is rendered unusable for any reason.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION North Field is a prime example of the Air Force's current focus on ACE as the centerpiece of how it expects to fight in the future, especially in a high-end fight in the Pacific. The airfield's grid-like layout inherently presents additional targeting challenges for a potential adversary like China, as you can read about in more detail in TWZ's recent story on what has been happening over the past year or so on Tinian. Guam has also seen significant military construction work in recent years, including to refurbish more of the World War II-era Northwest Field on the island to support ACE operations. Guam is now set to get a huge new air and missile defense architecture full of new surface-to-air missile launchers, radars, and other supporting facilities, as you can read more about here.

Missile Defense Agency A map showing radar arcs and other details giving a sense of the size and scope of the current plans for the new air and missile defense architecture on Guam. Missile Defense Agency 'These are the things that we need in our main operating bases. These are the things that we need to project power,' Gen. Schneider added, but did not explicitly mention hardened infrastructure. He also emphasized a desire to work more with regional allies and partners to 'gain greater access to those fields that are already in operating condition.' Air Force Gen. James Hecker, another member of yesterday's ACE panel at the AFA Warfare Symposium, also stressed the continued importance of existing main operating bases. Hecker, who is head of U.S. Air Forces in Europe and Air Forces Africa (USAFE-AFAFRICA), as well as NATO's Allied Air Command, highlighted significant challenges his service faces in successfully executing large-scale dispersed operations in the future, as well. 'I have the opportunity to talk to the Ukrainian air chief once every two weeks, or so. And they've been very successful not getting their aircraft hit on the ground,' Hecker said. 'And I ask him, I said, 'How is that? What do you do?' And he goes, 'Well, we never take off and land at the same airfield. I'm like, okay, you know, that's pretty good. Keeps the Russians on their toes.' 'I got tons of airfields from tons of allies, and we have access to all of them. The problem is, I can only protect a few of them,' he continued. 'We can't have that layered [defensive] effect for thousands of airbases. There's just no way it's going to happen.'

Hecker warned that just dispersing forces to more bases will not be a solution in of itself, either. 'So, to go think you're going to land at another airfield and hang out there for a week with no defense, you're going to get schwacked. It's going to happen,' he said. 'You can only stay there for a little bit, and then you've got to get back to your main operating bases.' 'It's going to be much shorter operations. You know, we're not talking weeks anymore,' Hecker explained. 'We're talking days, and sometimes we're talking hours, if you want to be survivable. And then back at your main operating base, you've got the layered defense.' Hecker called attention to how shrinking adversary kill chains are a key driving factor here, specifically highlighting Russia's efforts to reduce the total time it takes to complete a targeting cycle in operations in Ukraine. China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) has been doing the same, particularly with the help of a growing array of space-based surveillance assets. The time it takes from certain munitions like ballistic and hypersonic missiles to actually get to their targets after launch can also be very short. 'So it's really evolving the ACE concept,' the Air Force's top officer in Europe noted. Realities like the ones Hecker outlined are exactly what has been driving increasing criticism of the Air Force's current focus on ACE, as well as the service's general approach to basing and base defense, including from members of Congress and outside experts. Just in January, the Hudson Institute think tank in Washington, D.C., published a report warning that a lack of hardened and unhardened aircraft shelters, as well as other exposed infrastructure, at bases across the Pacific and elsewhere globally has left the U.S. military worryingly vulnerable. The report's authors assessed that just 10 missiles with warheads capable of scattering cluster munitions across areas 450 feet in diameter could be sufficient to neutralize all aircraft parked in the open and critical fuel storage facilities at key airbases like Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni in Japan, Naval Support Facility Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, or Langley Air Force Base in Virginia. Hudson Institute Another report that the Henry L. Stimson Center think tank published last December highlighted how Chinese missile strikes aimed just at cratering runways at bases in the Pacific could upend the U.S. military's ability to project airpower. 'While ‘active defenses’ such as air and missile defense systems are an important part of base and force protection, their high cost and limited numbers mean the U.S. will not be able to deploy enough of them to fully protect our bases,' a group of 13 Republican members of Congress wrote in an open letter to the Air Force back in May 2024. 'In order to complement active defenses and strengthen our bases, we must invest in ‘passive defenses,’ like hardened aircraft shelters… Robust passive defenses can help minimize the damage of missile attacks by increasing our forces’ ability to withstand strikes, recover quickly, and effectively continue operations.' 'While hardened aircraft shelters do not provide complete protection from missile attacks, they do offer significantly more protection against submunitions than expedient shelters (relocatable steel shelters),' the letter’s authors added. More shelters 'would also force China to use more force to destroy each aircraft, thereby increasing the resources required to attack our forces and, in turn, the survivability of our valuable air assets.' Outside of the United States, especially in China, but also in Russia, North Korea, and many other countries, there has been a growing trend in the expansion of hardened and otherwise more robust airbase infrastructure.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Air Force officials have also pushed back more actively on the idea of investing in additional physical hardening in recent years. 'I’m not a big fan of hardening infrastructure,' Gen. Kenneth Wilsbach said at a roundtable at the Air and Space Forces Association's main annual symposium in 2023. 'The reason is because of the advent of precision-guided weapons… you saw what we did to the Iraqi Air Force and their hardened aircraft shelters. They’re not so hard when you put a 2,000-pound bomb right through the roof.' Wilsbach was commander of PACAF at the time and has since become head of Air Combat Command (ACC), which oversees the vast majority of the Air Force's tactical combat jets and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft. The comments yesterday from the Air Force's current top officers in the Indo-Pacific region and Europe highlighting the continued focus on ACE and the challenges with that strategy are only likely to further fuel the ongoing debate about building more hardened infrastructure to help ensure American forces can continue to project air power in future fights.

F-15’s New EPAWSS Electronic Warfare Suite Already Has Successor ...	The F-15E’s Eagle Passive/Active Warning Survivability System, or EPAWSS, may only just have been issued to frontline units, but BAE Systems is already working on a new iteration of the radar warning and electronic warfare suite. The new EPAWSSv2 has not yet been flown, but the manufacturer is confident that its improved processing power and ability to handle a greater number of threats — coupled with other undisclosed improvements — will be of interest to Eagle operators, including the U.S. Air Force. Speaking to TWZ at the Air & Space Forces Association’s 2025 Warfare Symposium, Lindsay Gallagher, Product Line Director, TacAir EW at BAE Systems, confirmed that the EPAWSS V2 is headed into its critical design review (CDR) before the end of this month but has not yet been flown. CDR is a technical review that ensures the design is mature enough to move forward into manufacturing and flight testing. A U.S. Air Force F-15E arrives at RAF Lakenheath, England, on January 15, 2025, after being equipped with the baseline version of EPAWSS. U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Seleena Muhammad-Ali Gallagher explained that the V2 version of the system emerged as the company — together with Boeing — worked through the normal life cycle of the baseline EPWASS. 'You have obsolescence issues,' she said, 'and through that process, we’ve been able to make some improvements to the system, which we are now calling EPAWSSv2.' BAE Systems has revealed very few details about EPAWSSv2, but Gallagher confirmed that it encompasses both software and hardware changes. 'I can say that the biggest thing to note is the processing power,' Gallagher continued. 'This gives us the ability to handle future threats. We’re very in tune with them, and so we’re trying to stay ahead of them.' Compared to the baseline version, EPAWSSv2 will do 'everything a bit quicker,' Gallagher said, and will also be able to handle more threats simultaneously.

U.S. Air Force/1st Lt Savanah Bray In the past, BAE Systems has also suggested that future upgrades to EPAWSS could include a fiber-optic towed decoy, although it’s unclear if this is part of EPAWSSv2. Other potential enhancements that the company has alluded to in the past include 'expansion of frequency coverage and cognitive electronic warfare processing.' The latter capability, which we have discussed in depth in the past, would allow the system to identify previously unknown threat signals not in the system’s threat library and potentially create a countermeasure response to them on the fly. Gallagher noted that at least some of the software improvements that come with EPAWSSv2 could potentially be applicable to the baseline system. However, EPAWSS V2 primarily exists as a retrofit option for existing F-15 operators as well as a new-fit option for any new Eagle customers. Presently, BAE Systems is under contract to produce the baseline EPAWSS for the U.S. Air Force, for retrofit in the F-15E and for installation in the new-build F-15EX Eagle II. The company is also building the baseline system for Japan for the F-15J Japan Super Interceptor (JSI) upgrade program. Concept artwork of the F-15J Japan Super Interceptor (JSI). Boeing Gallagher said that the BAE Systems is not currently talking to the U.S. Air Force about EPAWSSv2, but this is very much an aspiration. She also confirmed that the company is talking to other F-15 operators around the world who might be looking to swap out their comparatively archaic Tactical Electronic Warfare System (TEWS) and upgrade to the new EPAWSS V2. News of EPAWSSv2 broke last month, but it had remained very low-profile until now. In February, Rob Novotny, Boeing’s executive director for F-15 business development, took to social media site X after a visit to BAE Systems. 'Great day in Nashua, NH, with our BAE Systems Inc. teammates talking EPAWSS and &#8230; EPAWSSv2!,' Novotny wrote. A reference to EPAWSSv2 also surfaced last month when BAE Systems mentioned it in a job advertisement that was looking for a 'senior TacAir product line test lead.' As for the original baseline EPAWSS, also known as the AN/ALQ-250, it began to be developed around a decade ago to replace the previous AN/ALQ-135 TEWS. The earlier suite had comprised three separate subcomponents: a radar warning receiver, a countermeasures controller, and a countermeasure dispenser. EPAWSS brings all of these functions together in the same system, which offers enhanced performance and is also integrated with the Raytheon AN/APG-82 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar. Altogether, this provides a major boost to the F-15E’s survivability. However, actually getting the baseline EPAWSS into operational service has taken a long time. As we reported at the time, the first operational F-15Es equipped with EPAWSS were delivered to the 48th Fighter Wing at RAF Lakenheath in England on January 15. The jets in question received the upgrade from BAE Systems in San Antonio, Texas.

Gen. Jason Voorheis, program executive officer for the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center’s Fighters and Advanced Aircraft Directorate, admitted, 'but this system is vital to our 21st-century fighter force structure. Not only does this system keep our most lethal fighter in the modern fight, [but] it’s an incredible deterrent in our Great Power Competition initiative.' Designed to sample the electromagnetic spectrum, identify threats, prioritize, and allocate jamming resources against them, the baseline EPAWSS is described by its manufacturer as follows: 'Providing both offensive and defensive electronic warfare options for the pilot and aircraft, EPAWSS offers fully integrated radar warning, geolocation, situational awareness, and self-protection solutions to detect and defeat surface and airborne threats in signal-dense contested and highly contested environments. Equipped with advanced electronic countermeasures, it enables deeper penetration against modern integrated air defense systems, providing rapid response capabilities to protect the aircrew.' An F-15E suspended from the ceiling at the Benefield Anechoic Facility during its first phase of testing of the baseline EPAWSS at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on May 8, 2019. U.S. Air Force/Ethan 'Evac' Wagner In the past, TWZ has also outlined how the original EPAWSS enhances the survivability of the F-15E in an operational scenario: 'EPAWSS ensures the Strike Eagle aircrew receives timely and accurate warnings of ground-based and airborne radio-frequency (RF) threats, including their specific type and location. With this enhanced situational awareness, the crew is much better able to avoid, engage, or negate the threat. As well as alerting the crew to the threats as a defensive system, EPAWSS is able to target these threats offensively, employing countermeasures and providing targeting for effectors. The system can also be used to detect and counter incoming infrared threats, but the F-15Es do not appear to have the missile approach warning systems (MAWS) detectors installed at this time, which would help significantly in this regard. In particular, the nature of the air defense threat has changed hugely since TEWS, which was developed based on analog technology from the 1970s. The kinds of high-end surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) that are proliferating now provide challenges to allied airpower that are far beyond what was in service with the primary Warsaw Pact adversary when the F-15E first entered service in the second half of the 1980s. But even since work on the baseline EPAWSS began, there have been further advances in the air defense threat, and the electromagnetic spectrum has become increasingly contested. This is especially the case for China and Russia, widely seen as the most likely high-end adversaries in any future conflict. A U.S. Air Force F-15E from RAF Lakenheath’s 494th Fighter Squadron returns to formation after receiving fuel over the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility on May 2, 2024. U.S. Air Force Photo/Staff Sgt. Devin Rumbaugh Typical air defense systems now fielded by these countries include very long-range missiles, active electronically scanned array (AESA) technology, counter-jamming capabilities, and a significant degree of mobility, making them hard to target. Perhaps most significantly, these systems can be woven together, with many different sensor types now being networked across a battlespace as part of an integrated air defense system (IADS). At the same time, weapons in this class are also becoming increasingly available to lower-tier adversaries. Clearly, the rapidly changing nature of the threat has driven BAE Systems to develop a new iteration of EPAWSS, although it’s worth noting that even the baseline system, with its open-architecture design, is intended to be rapidly updated to keep pace with the developing air defense threat. 'EPAWSS is a line update item, it’s one of those things that we just need to get the appropriate data and maintenance to load updated information,' Maj. Aaron 'Kamikazze' Eshkenazi of the 85th Test and Evaluation Squadron at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, explained to TWZ in a previous interview. A pilot and WSO from the 85th Test and Evaluation Squadron at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. Jamie Hunter There is even the possibility that the baseline EPWASS can be configured to meet new threats in near real-time in the future, something you can read more about here. Regardless, despite the undoubted capabilities of the baseline system, its manufacturer has determined that more can be done to protect the F-15 against new and emerging air defense threats. In the past, we have also examined how EPAWSS might become a very valuable tool for the integration of Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones and launched effects. The same capabilities it brings in terms of self-defense and situational awareness could be harnessed to provide the pilot with intelligence on where companion drones and launched effects should be best deployed. It’s certainly conceivable that the EPAWSSv2 will be even more applicable for this mission, thanks to its improved command over the electromagnetic battlespace. While BAE Systems appears to have earmarked the U.S. Air Force as the target customer for EPAWSSv2, it’s worth noting that there is still some uncertainty about the future size of the F-15E fleet. Before the arrival of EPAWSS, the F-15E relied on the obsolescent AN/ALQ-135 Tactical Electronic Warfare System (TEWS) for electronic warfare self-protection. U.S. Air Force/Senior Master Sgt. Ralph Branson Currently, the Air Force has 218 F-15Es in its inventory. Of those aircraft, 119 are powered by Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-220 turbofan engines that produce some 23,500 pounds of thrust each. The other 99 have the significantly more powerful F100-PW-229s, each rated at 29,000 pounds of thrust. The Air Force had planned to retire all of the F-15Es with the -220 engines, which are also older overall, by the end of Fiscal Year 2028. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 blocked the Air Force from retiring more than 68 F-15Es before the end of Fiscal Year 2029. Previously, it was reported that 99 F-15Es (those with F100-PW-229 engines) would get EPAWSS, but the new legislation could potentially see the number increase. However, with F-15Es upgraded with the baseline EPWASS only starting to trickle back into the operational inventory, the F-15EX might be a more obvious target for the EPAWSSv2, especially considering this platform’s growing relevance for a future high-end conflict in the Indo-Pacific theater, where electronic warfare self-protection would be at an absolute premium. Furthermore, the capabilities offered by EPAWSSv2 would be further enhanced by the large-area display in the Eagle II. A U.S. Air Force F-15EX Eagle II armed with 12 AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles. U.S. Air Force USAF/SSgt Blake Wiles Overall, at this early stage, the F-15EX appears to be excelling, with a glowing recent test report highlighting its performance in simulated combat, even against fifth-generation threats. On the other hand, the same report notes that new enemy long-range missiles could prove a challenge. EPAWSSv2 could also help mitigate that threat. Currently, the F-15EX is receiving the baseline EPWASS as it comes off the Boeing production line. However, F-15EX fleet numbers have been reduced from the original plan for at least 144 aircraft to what is now expected to be only 98 aircraft. With that in mind, it makes sense that BAE Systems is also targeting export F-15 operators. While Japan has signed up for the baseline EPWASS already, other international Eagle operators could be interested in EPAWSSv2. In addition to Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and South Korea, Israel would appear to be a prime candidate for EPAWSSv2. As well as its existing fleet of F-15I Ra’am aircraft, which are at the forefront of its long-range strike operations, Israel has also signed up for 25 F-15IA versions, a derivative of the Advanced Eagle. Traditionally, Israel has incorporated certain locally produced electronic warfare systems in its F-15s, but the EPAWSSv2 could well be of interest. With the current security situation in the Middle East, further Israeli acquisitions of combat aircraft — potentially also F-15s — are likely. Israel will buy 25 new F-15IA fighters, seen here in Boeing concept art. Boeing Boeing Furthermore, Indonesia plans to buy up to 24 Advanced Eagles, and the aircraft has also recently been pitched fairly aggressively toward Poland. Suffice it to say, the future of the F-15 looks secure, with new orders still coming in and with existing fleets set to serve for many decades to come. At the same time, the rapidly evolving nature of the air defense threat means that new electronic warfare self-protection capabilities are likely to not just be attractive but outright necessary for current and future F-15 fleets.

Lockheed’s Low-Cost Cruise Missile ‘Truck’ Is Now In Testing	Lockheed Martin has revealed more about its Common Multi-Mission Truck (CMMT, pronounced ‘comet’), a revised design based on its Speed Racer air vehicle concept, a missile-shaped uncrewed system you can read more about here. The CMMT is now said to be a family of systems, intended to yield low-cost subsonic air vehicles designed for a wide range of missions and for launch from both air and ground platforms. The ethos is very much in keeping with an ongoing U.S. Air Force push for cheaper, easier-to-produce munitions that has been accelerated by the realities of the current stockpile and its limited depth. Lockheed is currently pitching CMMT in two basic configurations. The first is a missile that will be deployed via U.S. Air Force fighters, bombers, and transports. Concept artwork this week by Lockheed Martin shows CMMTs being launched from a C-130 series airlifter (as seen at the top of this story) and from an F-16 fighter. The second configuration is for a smaller long-range launched effect that will be deployed from rotary-wing platforms — the related concept artwork shows an H-60 Black Hawk series helicopter. A head-on view of the CMMT in flight. Lockheed Martin At the 2025 Air & Space Forces Association (AFA) Warfare Symposium today, Lockheed Martin also showed concept artwork of a ground-launched version of CMMT, with an example being fired from an M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) using one of its rocket pods. This version is apparently based on the second configuration of CMTT, but it’s fitted with a supplementary booster for launching. A rendering of a ground-launched CMMT, fired from a HIMARS launcher. Lockheed Martin As for the air-launched version of the larger CMMT, Mike Rothstein, Vice President of Strategy and Requirements, Air Weapons and Sensors at Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control said at the AFA Warfare Symposium today that a potential palletized scenario could involve as many as 25 CMMTs. This compares with the nine palletized JASSM missiles used in Rapid Dragon, a previous experimental effort that armed airlifters with cruise missiles but which is, broadly speaking, conceptually similar to CMMT. An official Air Force model showing a Rapid Dragon pallet loaded with nine missiles. Joseph Trevithick Rothstein confirmed that, over the last weekend, the company completed a CMMT drop test, making use of the latest iteration of Rapid Dragon to test the new store in what he described as 'more of a lab test,' involving a common pallet dropped under a parachute. This will be followed up by a planned free flight test of CMMT later this year, Rothstein said. Lockheed Martin has recently also released more details about the development path for CMMT — which it says is 'highly adaptable and affordable' and which 'can be produced and delivered as fast as it is expended.' The ability to produce munitions at scale is something that is increasingly seen as a key requirement by the U.S. military. To try and meet this demand, Lockheed Martin says it benefited from 1LMX — a program to 're-engineer its internal processes.' Two images showing the rapid prototyping effort for the CMMT program. Lockheed Martin 1LMX is said to be the largest internal program ever undertaken by the company and is focused on 'automations and capabilities required to drive efficiency, increase velocity, and enhance … key captures and programs.' One of the first programs to leverage 1LMX was Rapid Dragon, another Air Force initiative in keeping with the Pentagon’s doctrine of ‘affordable mass.’ Lockheed Martin and the Air Force started work on Rapid Dragon in early 2021 and, within the first 10 months, had conducted three customer exercises and a first flight. Rapid Dragon went on to yield four live-fire strike missions from airlifters, two in the United States and two abroad. As Lockheed Martin was preparing Rapid Dragon for fielding, the company was also 'developing affordable mass weapons to support the Air Force mission —and a few others.' This includes CMMT, which Lockheed Martin says is chiefly a manufacturing program rather than a technology development effort. As such, the aim was to drastically reduce the normal development path, producing a low-cost design that was '100 percent producible from the start.' Once a scalable product is achieved, 'performance-enhancing and mission-specific capabilities' will be introduced later 'as use cases and threats emerge.' CMMT has an open architecture and modular design. This means it can be manufactured using distributed supply chains and production lines that can surge to meet customer demands. At the same time, new capabilities can be easily added as required. For this reason, too, Lockheed Martin typically refers to CMMT not as a missile but as an air vehicle since it can be fitted with different types of sensors as well as a warhead. Potentially, it could also be easily adapted as an air-launched decoy. A screengrab from an earlier Skunk Works video shows notional payloads inside the front end of a CMMT drone. Antennas or RF-transparent apertures or glazed low-observable ‘windows’ for electro-optics are shown on the side and bottom of the forward fuselage. Lockheed Martin Skunk Works capture By utilizing 1LMX, Lockheed Martin was able to reduce the time required to get CMMT to a preliminary design review by 50 percent, the company says. At the same time, as mentioned, CMMT is not an all-new design, since it also draws from the earlier Speed Racer. A product of Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works advanced projects division, this was an experimental low-cost 'pathfinder' design that was developed first to demonstrate new digital engineering and advanced manufacturing methods — techniques that were also rolled into 1LMX. Like CMMT, Speed Racer was based around a modular architecture that allowed it to be relatively readily reconfigured for different mission sets. Speed Racer was also designed to be a low-cost vehicle, with a planned unit cost significantly under $2 million, and was not intended to be recovered after a mission. The older Lockheed Martin video below includes a rendering of the Speed Racer experimental vehicle, as seen in the thumbnail. Back in July 2022, Lockheed Martin unveiled four distinct uncrewed aircraft designs, one of which was CMMT, with Speed Racer being disclosed as the basis for it. An official project video released by Lockheed Martin depicted an F-35 launching a future CMMT from a wing pylon, a mode of employment that would negatively impact the jet’s stealthy characteristics. CMMTs seen in an earlier rendering with single offset air intakes and V-shaped tail assemblies. Lockheed Martin Skunk Works Meanwhile, other similar designs have emerged, and it’s notable that the current CMMT looks quite similar to Anduril’s Barracuda, a new family of what that company is calling 'expendable autonomous air vehicles' that are scalable, highly modular, and already being flight-tested. However, Barracuda is just one of an increasing number of cheaper cruise missiles now in the works, and this is an area that has attracted particular interest from smaller firms, including some brand-new players.

At the forefront of this is the Pentagon’s Replicator initiative, which is accelerating work on low-cost air vehicles that could evolve into relatively cheap cruise missiles. 'As we envision the environment that we have to work in, we understand that in a global conflict, and the kind of conflict we’re going to have, maybe against a peer competitor, being able to get mass on targets is important,' Rothstein said. 'We know we got to be able to produce at more rate,' Rothstein continued. 'And we know we have to work not only with some of the exquisite high-end weapons that we do so well, such as JASSM and LRASM, but we are also listening and understanding that there’s a need to bring more affordable mass to that target. Think of [CMMT] like a low-cost cruise missile.' Artwork showing the general configuration of the CMMT, with its pop-out wings deployed. Lockheed Martin With a genesis that dates back several years, and with the experience of the Speed Racer and Rapid Dragon, Lockheed Martin will hope that its CMMT is well positioned for future success — especially the scalable mass production that is a central tenet of its design.

MQ-20 Avenger Tests ‘Hivemind’ AI In Orange Flag Exercise	General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. (GA-ASI), has revealed that its jet-powered MQ-20 Avenger drone, equipped with U.S. government-provided autonomy software, took part in a recent Orange Flag large force test exercise. This is the latest milestone for the Avenger, which has been heavily involved in the testing of different artificial-intelligence-driven autonomy systems for several years now. GA-ASI announced today that one of two company-owned MQ-20s, with the so-called 'reference autonomy stack' software, flew in a demonstration at Orange Flag 25-1, which took place at Edwards Air Force Base, California, from February 19-21. You can read more about the Orange Flag series, which is focused on developmental test activities, in this previous article.

Photo courtesy of General Atomics Air Force Test Center Once integrated in the MQ-20, Shield AI’s reference autonomy stack — which included a pilot vehicle interface (PVI) — demonstrated autonomous flight operation, with a focus on air-to-air engagements. 'The government-provided PVI enabled seamless control and monitoring of the autonomy stack, highlighting the interoperability and flexibility of GA-ASI’s UCAV ecosystem,' the company said in a statement. 'The Shield AI stack demonstrated autonomy skills for safe administrative phases of flight.' 'This demonstration marks a significant achievement in our ongoing efforts to operationalize autonomy for UCAVs,' added GA-ASI Vice President of Advanced Programs Michael Atwood. 'Flying the government reference autonomy stack at Orange Flag 25-1 and utilizing the government-provided PVI underscores our commitment to delivering robust and adaptable autonomy solutions for the warfighter.' An important part of the demonstration was to prove that the MQ-20 — and, by extension, other GA-ASI drones — can be rapidly reconfigured from using company-written software to government-provided or other vendors’ software as required. This has important implications in terms of flexibility for future drones once in service, so they can receive new software — enabling new capabilities and/or enhanced interoperability — very rapidly. Speaking to TWZ at the Air & Space Forces Association’s 2025 Warfare Symposium, a spokesperson from Shield AI said that the process of integrating the reference autonomy stack in the MQ-20 took 'about three weeks.' A picture of a drone control system using a tablet-like device that General Atomics has previously released. GA-ASI The demonstration also showed that the MQ-20 can rapidly swap between autonomy systems mid-flight, as C. Mark Brinkley, a General Atomics spokesman, explained to TWZ. 'During Orange Flag, we were able to fly both a government [AI] architecture as well as sort of mid-flight switch over to the Shield AI software and let that software take over.' Brinkley also told TWZ why he considers the MQ-20 an ideal platform for these kinds of tests, which are intended to feed into the Air Force’s Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) program. 'The interesting thing about MQ-20 is it’s sort of still ahead of its time as far as jet UCAVs goes. We continue to use it as a CCA surrogate, and I suspect we will continue to do that for some time. We have two company aircraft that we own and can fly and use whenever we want. The ability to use the MQ-20 the way that you would a CCA in terms of loading on software, experimenting with autonomy actions, experimenting with different types of missions, like we did in Orange Flag, and then be able to take all that data off of a real airplane, and go back into the virtual world and make changes as necessary, it’s really been a game-changer for our ability to move that forward.' 'For us, it’s really using an aircraft that exists,' Brinkley added. 'We don’t have to wait until there are some new aircraft. I mean, we’re building our CCA. We have plenty of aircraft out there. Having two company-owned MQ-20s, you might look at them and say, ‘Well, that’s too big for what the CCA program might be, they might cost too much. It’s not exactly what you’re looking for.’ That’s fine. But in terms of trying to get to autonomy and autonomous flight and autonomous missions, you can do a lot of it in the virtual environment, but really having a real aircraft to team with them has been unique for us.' In the context of the MQ-20 demonstration at Orange Flag, the drone’s reference autonomy stack was a product of Shield AI, a relatively new by fast-moving aerospace company that you can read more about here. The stack is referred to by that company as Hivemind Enterprise. Shield AI’s original Hivemind was an ‘AI pilot’ that has been used in real-world fighter aircraft test flights linked to advanced U.S. Air Force programs, as well as to control a host of Kratos drones and in Shield AI’s own MQ-35 V-BAT drone. Hivemind is also expected to feed into the Air Force’s emerging Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) program. A V-BAT is prepared for flight onboard the destroyer USS Michael Monsoor (DDG-1001) during Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) 2022. U.S. Navy In the words of Shield AI’s co-founder, president, and chief growth officer Brandon Tseng, Hivemind 'enables aircraft to accomplish missions fully autonomously without GPS, without communications, without a remote pilot. What do I mean by fully autonomous mission execution? In the example of our NOVA quadcopter, it would go inside buildings, and it would find threats, it would map out the building, it would clear the building all by itself without anybody piloting it. GPS didn’t matter, communications didn’t matter, it would accomplish the mission.' The NOVA 2 quadcopter, which features Hivemind. Shield AI From the start, Hivemind was intended as a core central system within an aircraft and one that can be leveraged across many different platforms. In this way, Hivemind first began to be installed in small quadcopters and then in increasingly more complex drones, all the way up to the MQ-20, as well as crewed surrogate aircraft. In addition to providing ‘self-piloting’ technology for aircraft, Hivemind enables cooperative teaming and swarming. Using Hivemind AI, a group of drones can execute a mission, working together dynamically, reading and reacting to each other, to the battlefield, to the adversarial threats, and so on. This can be accomplished at computer speeds. Hivemind is designed to be agnostic to the original equipment manufacturer, and the company has said in the past that it wants the AI technology 'to fly on every single CCA.' However, Hivemind is just one of a number of AI agents that has been flown in the MQ-20. 'We’ve proven that we’ve been able to fly a lot of different autonomy engines and autonomy pilots in the aircraft,' Brinkley adds. 'It’s flown Skyborg, it’s flown the DARPA CODE engine. It’s flown our own AI.' Brinkley is also cognizant of the fact that AI software from more than one supplier might find its way into the CCA program and into other GA-ASI drones. 'With software, it’s not a winner-take-all kind of game. Just like when you take your phone out and you’re running an operating system on your phone, but you and I might have different maps, we might have different email programs, we might have different games that we play or whatever. There’s not going to be just one way to do this. Across the services, across different nations, they may all want to do things differently.' Whoever provides it, AI will be especially important to achieving the Air Force’s ambition for crewed-uncrewed teaming, including having fighters, like the F-35, operate as inflight ‘quarterbacks’ for these advanced drones. For the Air Force, how pilots in crewed aircraft will actually manage CCAs during operations has emerged as an increasingly important question and has already yielded related trials, as you can read about here. The Air Force is also still very much in the process of developing new concepts of operations and tactics, techniques, and procedures for employing CCA drones operationally. How the drones will fit into the service’s force structure and be utilized in routine training and other day-to-day peacetime activities, along with what the maintenance and logistical demands will be, also remains to be seen. Questions about in-flight command and control have emerged as particularly important ones to answer in the near term. Models of the drones General Atomics (at top) and Anduril (at bottom) are developing as part of the CCA program’s Increment 1. General Atomics/Jamie Hunter The latest edition of the Orange Flag test exercise further underlines the importance of the MQ-20 as a testbed for future autonomous collaborative platforms and adds yet another platform to the growing roster that is using different iterations of Shield AI’s Hivemind AI technology.

Next Generation Fighter Critical To Future Air Superiority Key US...	A deep review of the U.S. Air Force's paused plans to acquire a new crewed sixth-generation stealth combat jet came to the unambiguous conclusion that the service needs such an aircraft to be best positioned to achieve air superiority in future high-end fights. The same analyses further reinforced the view that establishing air superiority will remain central to winning those same conflicts. A panel of senior U.S. Air Force officers discussed what is commonly called the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) combat jet, as well as the future of air superiority operations more broadly, at the Air & Space Forces Association’s (AFA) 2025 Warfare Symposium earlier today. 'Many of you know, we put a pause on NGAD, and we put a pause on NGAD to reflect, and we did a study on it,' Air Force Maj. Gen. Joseph Kunkel said early on in the panel. Kunkel is currently director of Force Design, Integration, and Wargaming within the office of the deputy chief of staff for Air Force Futures at the service’s top headquarters at the Pentagon. A rendering of a notional sixth-generation crewed stealth combat jet. Collins Aerospace 'With that study, we asked ourselves some hard questions,' he continued. 'Is air superiority dead? What does air superiority look like in the future? Does the joint force need air superiority? And what we found is, not only in the past, not only the present, but in the future, air superiority matters.' 'We tried a whole bunch of different options, and there was no more vital option than NGAD to achieve air superiority in this highly contested environment,' Kunkel added. This is fully in line with comments that Maj. Gen. Kunkel made at a separate event that the Hudson Institute think tank hosted last week, which TWZ covered at the time. Envisioned ostensibly as a successor to the F-22 Raptor stealth fighter, the NGAD combat jet requirements, at least as existed prior to the review, are understood to call for a relatively large, high-performance, and long-range design. The NGAD aircraft has also long been expected to feature a very high level of broadband low-observability (stealthiness) together with an array of advanced sensor, networking, electronic warfare, and other capabilities. All of that has been expected to come at considerable cost, with former Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall saying in January that it would take at least approximately $20 billion to finish the developmental stage of the program. Serial production of the jets, which cost upwards of $300 million apiece, would add tens of billions more to the overall price tag. A pair of F-22 Raptors. USAF The alternatives to the NGAD combat jet that the Air Force is known to have explored include a truncated, lower-cost aircraft intended primarily to serve as an airborne drone controller. The service also considered a force-wide shift in focus away from air superiority to longer-range, standoff strike capabilities like those the B-21 Raider stealth bomber will provide. Kunkel and the other Air Force officers on today's panel stressed that NGAD is just one part of the bigger and more critical matter of how to effectively provide air superiority in future major conflicts, such as one in the Pacific against China. 'The entire joint force counts on air superiority. So, anything else you want to do in the battle space, if you don't have air superiority, it becomes much more difficult, if not impossible,' Gen. Kenneth Wilsbach, head of Air Combat Command (ACC), another one of the panelists, said. 'So, if we want to collect intelligence, if we want to do casualty evacuation, if we want to drop some bombs, if you want to sail some ships around, or if you want to have some ground maneuver, if you don't have air and space superiority, you will not be able to or you will have a very difficult time achieving any of those other objectives.' 'There's been some talk in the public about [how] the age of air superiority is over,' Wilsbach continued. 'I categorically reject that and maintain that it's the first building block of any other military operation.' Wilsbach cited the emergence of two previously unseen Chinese stealth combat jets this past December as further evidence that air superiority is not dead and that America's chief competitor believes it to be similarly critical for success in future conflicts. The two Chinese stealth aircraft 'we believe are for air superiority,' Wilsbach said. 'As we observe what China has produced, and we can presume we know what that's for, for air superiority, what are we going to do about it? And I don't believe that nothing is an option.'

'We're making this transition from a platform-centric Air Force to a system-centric Air Force,' Gen. Kunkel said. 'And as kill chains get longer and longer,&#8230; we need to think about how are we trying to do that whole system.' Chief of Staff of the Air Force Gen. David Allvin made similar remarks during a keynote speech at the AFA Warfare Symposium yesterday evening. 'We’re looking at different ways to execute the same mission. We’re going beyond just single platforms equal single things,' Allvin said. 'Maybe there’s different ways to provide combat effects, understanding what that is, embracing and leaning into human machine teaming, understanding what autonomy can actually do for us, knowing that’s going to be a part of our future.' Allvin then announced new 'fighter drone' designations for the designs that General Atomics and Anduril are currently developing in the first phase, or Increment 1, of the Collaborative Aircraft (CCA) program. CCA is part of the larger NGAD initiative that also includes the planned sixth-generation stealth combat jet. The NGAD aircraft has always been envisioned as serving, in part, as a forward drone controller and otherwise operating closely together with CCAs. A composite rendering of the CCA designs that General Atomics, at top, and Anduril, at bottom, are currently developing, along with their new formal designations. General Atomics/Anduril/TWZ The panelists today were also definitive in their belief that piloted combat aircraft will continue to have a role for the foreseeable future. 'We've been doing quite a bit of simulator work with incorporating manned and unmanned teaming, and we believe that there's some value to that as we go into the future,' Gen. Wilsbach said. '[However,] in 2025 we don't have the artificial intelligence [AI] that we can pluck pilots out of aircraft and plunk AI in them to the degree that the AI can replace a human brain. Someday we will have that, I trust, but right now we don't.' 'We're in this place where we're improving the artificial intelligence aspects, the human-machine team, all those areas are growth areas, but we have to iterate to the outcome,' Lt. Gen. Dale White, currently the Military Deputy in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, added during the panel discussion today. 'And I think that's &#8230; the path that we're on.' 'As we walk down this warfighting path, we're going to have to iterate to the outcome, and it's going to take some time,' he continued. 'I know this Air Force is up to the task. I think CCA is going to put us on that path.' 'The reality is, this is where the threat is taking this because our adversaries are doing very similar things,' White also said during the panel discussion in regard to AI and advances in autonomy more generally. 'We can't sit back and just watch.' 'I don't see us fully stepping away from, you now, manned aircraft ever,' Gen. Kunkel added. A final decision on what course of action to take in regard to the NGAD combat jet, and what that aircraft might look like in the end, has yet to be made. There are also lingering budgetary questions. Concerns about the affordability of the new sixth-generation aircraft were an important factor in prompting last year's review of the program to begin with. The Air Force has a number of modernization priorities it needs to balance funding for, including the CCA program and work on new stealthy aerial refueling tankers. Aviation Week just recently reported that service might be considering axing Next-Generation Air-Refueling System (NGAS), or at least the stealth tanker component, to help preserve funds for the NGAD aircraft. There is also the matter of the ballooning costs of the Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile program and an ongoing debate about the optimal size of the future B-21 Raider stealth bomber fleet. A rendering of a notional stealth aerial refueling tanker. Lockheed Martin Skunk Works On top of this, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has ordered a complete review of spending plans for the upcoming 2026 Fiscal Year. The goal is to cut tens of billions of dollars from existing programs to help fund new priorities under President Donald Trump, including the Golden Dome missile defense initiative. Dysfunction in Congress raises additional concerns about when any major new defense spending might get approved. 'Fiscal constraints don't change what it takes to win,' Gen. Kunkel said. 'We know what it takes to win. It takes all of the Air Force. It takes air superiority. And if America wants to make those investments to win, then we'll do so. If America doesn't want to make those investments, then we'll take more risk.' 'I'm not so foolish to think that this is like a black and white decision on, you know, win versus loss. There's a degree of risk involved,' he added. 'But if we fund more force, we decrease operational risk. We decrease the risk for our policy makers.' 'And it is true that our adversaries are moving quickly. They are,' he continued. 'Fiscal choices should be driven by what it takes to win.' Another rendering of notional sixth-generation combat jets. Lockheed Martin Gen. Kunkel has been and remains particularly bullish on the Air Force ultimately coming out of the current budget uncertainty with an increase in funding rather than a decrease. He did also acknowledge at the Hudson Institute event last week that cuts to existing programs could still be painful. Many questions remain to be answered about the NGAD aircraft's future. However, it is now clear that the Air Force has concluded that the path forward that offers the best option for achieving critical air superiority in future high-end fights with the lowest amount of risk includes buying a fleet of new crewed sixth-generation stealth combat jets.

F-22 Raptor Finally Getting A Helmet Mounted Display	The F-22 Raptor is finally getting a Helmet Mounted Display (HMD) — Thales' popular Scorpion system — with the Hawaii Air National Guard's F-22s being slated to receive it. The rest of the F-22 community could follow their lead. At the same time, a larger contract to replace all of the Joint Helmet Mounted Cuing Systems (JHMCS) worn by USAF F-16C/D Block 40/42 and Block 50/52 pilots with the Scorpion was just announced. The award displaces JHMCS as the dominant HMD on USAF F-16s, with one HMD type now being standardized across the Air Force's Viper fleet. The fact that the F-22, the world's most capable air-to-air fighter, does not have an HMD has always been a point of contention. It was originally planned that Raptor pilots would get one, but this was cut during development. It has been discussed that JHMCS, in particular, had integration issues with the type. Even as the Raptor gained the AIM-9X missile capable of hitting targets far off the centerline of the jet during a dogfight, F-22 pilots still lacked the ability to target it dynamically via its primary method — an HMD. You can read all about this strange situation in this past piece of ours. Regardless, now the Air National Guard is taking the lead on fixing the issue once and for all with the help of the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU). The 199th Fighter Squadron out of Honolulu is set to integrate the Scorpion with their Raptors. The Scorpion HMD seen on display at AFA Warfare Symposium in Colorado this week. (Howard Altman) (Howard Altman) Our Howard Altman talked with Thales about Scorpions latest wins on the show floor of AFA's Warfare Symposium in Colorado today, with Thales' Lou Taddeo telling TWZ: 'We just won a contract from the Defense Innovation Unit… Ostensibly we're working really with the first real customer, the Air National Guard… to put Scorpion on ANG-operated F-22s. So that just kicked off, and we hope that eventually the big Air Force will also buy Scorpion for the rest of the U.S. Air Force F-22 fleet.' The contract to equip the Raptor with Scorpion was awarded in September, 2024, under the Raptor Open System Tactical-Helmet Display (ROST-HD) program. Interesting enough, a version of Scorpion was previously tested on the F-22, although little is known about the circumstances surrounding those trials. Competing priorities in terms of upgrades have always been a challenge for the F-22 fleet and the Scorpion never made it into operational Raptor cockpits. You can read more about this in our past exclusive reporting here. F-22 pilot wearing Scorpion at Nellis AFB back in 2020. (Jamie Hunter) JHMCS had brought about helmet-mounted display and targeting technology to the USAF's fighter fleets and has been serving for over two decades on USAF F-15s and F-16s. While providing heads-up situational awareness unlike any hard-mounted display could, it also gave USAF 4th generation fighters the ability to fully utilize the AIM-9X Sidewinder's high off-boresight (HOBS) targeting capability. In other words, the pilot has to just look at the target within a specific engagement envelope in order for the AIM-9X to lock on. Meanwhile, Scorpion has become an increasingly dominant player within the USAF's stable, equipping Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Block 30 F-16s, as well as USAF A-10s, These users are in addition to more unique use cases, like aboard the AC-130 gunship. Scorpion has also found its way into the private adversary support community, with TacAir's F-5ATs and Top Aces' F-16A/Bs being equipped with the type. AC-130 pilot wearing the Scorpion HMD.

The original JHMCS is not night vision goggle compatible. Scorpion is also capable of projecting in full color, not just monochrome, which can help with crew interpretation of the vast amount of information that can be displayed through the system. This includes weapons targeting, navigation, sensor, and data-link symbology. Going beyond simpler flight data and weapons information, modern HMDs like Scorpion leverage augmented reality that can project friend and foe locations all around the pilot. In a media release, Thales states: 'This contact, issued by the USAF utilizing the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA), is the first of several anticipated delivery orders to modernize the USAF fleet of F-16s with more interoperable technology. The contract arrangement also allows a procurement option for any F-16 NATO partner to modernize with Scorpion kit capability. Initial kits are anticipated to be delivered to the USAF in early ​ 2025. The Scorpion HMD kits will replace the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) and allow the USAF a standardized Scorpion HMD solution across Air Force, Air National Guard and USAF Reserve F-16s. Scorpion provides a modern digital platform allowing for enhanced pilot situational awareness with full color symbology and a single display for both day and night operations. Tracking accuracy is also markedly improved, as Scorpion is baselined with Visionix's precision HObIT (Hybrid Optically based Inertial Tracker) tracker. The HObIT system provides precise tracking through a fusion of inertial-optical technology.' An image showing how Scorpion's monocle fits behind night vision goggles. (Thales) Media Services Thales' Taddeo expanded a bit more for us on what Scorpion will bring to the table for USAF F-16s and how it compares to JHMCS in general: 'Scorpion compared to classic joint helmet [JHMCS]… Scorpion is a near eye display, full color out of the box, night vision and extreme accuracy off axis cuing… JHMCS was designed in 1996, I was on that team. So it's needed for up upgrade.' 'Scorpion came along in 2009… Air National Guard A-10s and F-16 block 30s, and then we iterated it with our inertial tracker, HObIT. It still offers near eye display, color symbology, and the tracker accuracy of HObIT is superior to JHMCS. But what the warfighter likes is its adaptability to the cockpit and simplistic approach to HMDs. They love the near eye display, and they love color. We give the warfighter the option to change the symbology any way they want. We actually deliver a software developers kit for free. So our customers can make their own symbology. We're out of the symbology game… In the case of F 16, the U.S. Air Force owns it. When we're going to replace JHMCS in the block 40s and 50s, we actually have a kit that we developed… that directly replaces JHMCS. We colorize the symbology better tracker accuracy and out of the box night vision cueing using the customer's own night vision goggles.' As to what the future holds for Scorpion, Taddeo also told TWZ: 'The cool part about scorpion is it's a modular system. When we iterate things, we don't sell you a new helmet. We're working on the next better version of our waveguide display, higher resolution, more bright, cheaper. We'll just offer a replacement kit for the display. We did it with a tracker. We had a magnetic tracker and we developed the inertial optical tracker. We actually took these kits back and we just gave them a new kit with a new tracker and their old display… So that's kind of our approach. So the future is, this thing can still grow as the technology matures.'

Rotating Detonation Engine For Future High-Performance Missiles S...	A novel type of jet propulsion, a rotating detonation engine (RDE), has been successfully tested by Pratt & Whitney. The development could be highly significant for the U.S. military, with RDE technology at the center of the project called Gambit, which aims to provide a propulsion system for a mass-producible, low-cost, high-supersonic, long-range weapon for air-to-ground strike. Artwork the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has previously released related to the Gambit project. DARPA RTX — of which Pratt & Whitney is a business unit — announced today that a series of tests on the RDE has been completed at the RTX Technology Research Center in Connecticut. Previously, RDE propulsion systems had only been run in the form of small prototypes. Next, the company says it will move on to integrated engine and vehicle ground tests, to be conducted with the U.S. Department of Defense 'in the coming years.' 'Our testing simulated aggressive assumptions for how and where the rotating detonation engine needs to perform,' Chris Hugill, senior director of Pratt & Whitney’s GATORWORKS development team, said in a media release about the latest campaign. 'This testing validated key elements of Pratt & Whitney’s design approach and provides substantiation to continue RTX vehicle and propulsion integration to accelerate future capabilities for our customers.' In terms of how they operate, RDE propulsion systems have significant differences compared to a traditional turbojet or turbofan engine and hardly require any moving parts. In turbojet or turbofan engines, air is fed in from an inlet and compressed and then is mixed with fuel and burned via deflagration (where combustion occurs at a subsonic rate) in a combustion chamber. This process creates the continuous flow of hot, high-pressure air needed to make the whole system run. In an RDE, the combustion (which happens at a supersonic rate) occurs in an enclosed, annular (ring-shaped) chamber. During flight, fast-moving air is sucked into the chamber and a mixture of fuel is injected into it. The injection ignites a flame-like detonation wave that travels around the ring for as long as fuel is injected, in a thermodynamic cycle, providing propulsive thrust. 1. Combustion in the enclosed, ring-shaped chamber. RTX 2. In flight, fast-moving air is drawn into the chamber, and fuel mixture is injected. RTX 3. Injection ignites a flame-like detonation wave that travels around the ring for as long as fuel is injected. RTX The advantages of an RDE include high thermal efficiency and more power, which means the engine can also be smaller, lighter, and more cost-effective. After all, most longer-range air-to-ground missiles today require scaled-down jet engines that are single use, making this a much less cost-effective propulsion setup. In a practical application, such as a missile, since an RDE is more compact than a traditional engine, there is more space for fuel, giving longer range. Additional capacity can also be used to house sensors, warheads, or other payloads. A video provides a more detailed walkthrough of the rotating detonation engine concept: Pratt & Whitney’s current work on the RDE is based on a contract from the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), which called upon Raytheon (now RTX) to develop this kind of propulsion for 'effectors' — primarily missiles. The initial work was conducted by the RTX Technology Research Center, which then teamed up with Pratt & Whitney to mature the technology. Ultimately, the RDE is planned to power a new generation of effectors, including missiles designed and developed by Raytheon. Experimentation with RDE concepts dates back to the 1950s, but actually creating a workable engine of this type had proved elusive until very recently, at least publicly. According to RTX, there were two main technological hurdles to overcome before the RDE could be successfully demonstrated. The first challenge involved the fuel injection component. Simply put, the balance of air and fuel in the chamber has to be perfect, consistently, to ensure an effective detonation wave. The second challenge, RTX says, was designing and manufacturing parts, which relied upon advanced techniques, including additive manufacturing and physics-based modeling. Overall, RTX’s work on the RDE is closely related to a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) project called Gambit. The main aim of this effort is 'to develop and demonstrate a novel rotating detonation engine propulsion system that enables a mass-producible, low-cost, high-supersonic, long-range weapon for air-to-ground strike in an anti-access/area denial (A2AD) environment.' Gambit was launched in 2022, and the following year, Raytheon secured a contract from DARPA to develop and demonstrate a practical RDE for the Gambit project. While RTX talks about the potential for the rotating detonation concept to be harnessed in the broad category of 'effectors,' it would appear to be of greatest significance for future missiles, like the ones envisioned under DARPA’s Gambit project. Missiles using this kind of propulsion arrangement would achieve greater efficiency and lighter (and potentially smaller) missile bodies, which in turn would allow for enhanced performance — especially in terms of range — and/or payload capacity. Future missiles that are able to achieve efficient sustained supersonic speed over long distances would be of considerable importance in terms of time-sensitive mission requirements. Above all, any future high-end conflict in the Pacific, such as one against China, would automatically involve all sorts of operational demands across a broad area, much of it covered in water. 'The government is looking for missiles that go faster and fly farther,' Beata Maynard, an associate director in Advanced Military Engines at Pratt & Whitney, said in a media release today. 'Combining Pratt & Whitney propulsion technology with a Raytheon vehicle could result in a weapons system that addresses warfighters’ immediate needs.' A rendering of a notional rotating detonation engine-powered missile that the AFRL has previously released. USAF/AFRL via Aviation Week RDE is not the only exotic propulsion system that’s being considered to power future missiles, effectors, and even aircraft. There are also ramjets and dual-mode ramjets (the latter also using RDE technology), which can confer hypersonic performance. Hypersonic speed is defined as anything above Mach 5. While there’s clearly an appetite for the kinds of advantages that a rotating detonation engine would confer on a variety of future missiles, it should be recalled that this technology is very much still in its infancy. There will be plenty more hurdles to overcome before propulsion systems of this kind find their way into actual missiles. However, once mastered, this technology promises to significantly help lower the cost and accelerate the production, on top of the various performance advantages.

Mysterious Naval Vessel Spotted In Washington State Is A New DARP...	A slender, partially covered naval ship that recently emerged in Washington state is the Defiant, a new medium-sized uncrewed surface vessel (USV) designed from the keel up to operate without any humans ever onboard. Developed under the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) No Manning Required Ship (NOMARS) program, Defiant could be an important stepping stone for the U.S. Navy's ambitions to add larger and more capable USVs to its fleets. DARPA confirmed to TWZ that construction of the Defiant, also known by the hull code USX-1, was completed earlier this month. As noted, the first indications that the vessel had been launched came from residents in Washington state who spotted it being pushed by a tug through the Saratoga Passage in Puget Sound north of Seattle. This area of the Sound is also just a few miles from the U.S. Navy's Naval Air Station (NAS) Whidbey Island. User @IntelWalrus on X was first to bring this to our attention. The USX-1 Defiant seen being moved from the shipyard to the water earlier this month. DARPA The USX-1 Defiant seen after its launch.DARPA The 180-foot-long, 240-metric ton Defiant is now set to 'undergo extensive in-water testing, both dockside and at sea' and 'is scheduled to depart for a multi-month at sea demonstration in spring 2025,' according to DARPA. It is unclear where exactly the vessel is currently docked. Serco Inc. is the primary contractor for the USV, which it has been developing since 2020. The company has told TWZ in the past that the core Defiant USV without any add-on mission systems has an approximately $25 million price tag. The U.S. military has historically categorized uncrewed vessels like Defiant with lengths under 200 feet and displacements under 500 tons, but that are larger than ones with speedboat and jetski-type designs, as medium USVs (MUSV). Large USVs (LUSV) have been defined as ones up to 300 feet long and that displace up to 2,000 tons. A picture of Defiant in the Puget Sound, as well as additional images DARPA has now released, show much of the vessel literally still under wraps. However, the overall hullform, along with the mast at the center sporting various commercial navigation radars and other antennas, is in line with models and computer-generated renders of the design shown in the past. An additional smaller mast with more radars and other antennas is also present on the bow. A view of the USX-1 Defiant with the vessel's main mast and the smaller mast at the bow visible. DARPA A previously released rendering of the Defiant design. DARPA Other details about Defiant as it exists now are limited and TWZ has also reached out to Serco for more information. NOMARS program requirements DARPA released in the past called for designs capable of long-duration open-ocean operation with distributed hybrid power generation, podded propulsors, and high-capacity batteries, as well as a high-degree of hydrodynamic efficiency. The NOMARS program has also put an emphasis on a concept called 'graceful degradation' wherein 'individual equipment to fail over time by having enough system-level redundancy to meet full system requirements at speeds of at least 15 knots after one year at sea.' As designed, Defiant has large open spaces on top of its deck in front of and behind its main mast for add-on payloads. Secro has shown models loaded with standard shipping containers, which could hold an array of different mission systems, as well as general cargo. The company has also shown how the USV might be armed using what BAE Systems is now marketing as the Adaptable Deck Launching System (ADL). The ADL is a modular angled launcher designed to fire missiles from the same canisters used with the Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) found on many U.S. and foreign warships. As such, ADLs can launch a variety of surface-to-air, anti-ship, and land-attack missiles, as well as anti-submarine rockets. A model of the Defiant with a standard 40-foot shipping container behind the main mast and an ADL at the bow end. Joseph Trevithick An ADL fires a missile during testing on land. BAE Systems Defiant, at least initially, is intended primarily as a testbed to demonstrate the ability of such a vessel to operate autonomously for extended periods without any humans ever being onboard, even just to monitor systems and provide extra margins of safety. 'The NOMARS program aims to challenge the traditional naval architecture model, designing a seaframe (the ship without mission systems) from the ground up with no provision, allowance, or expectation for humans on board,' DARPA says on its website. 'By removing the human element from all ship design considerations, the program intends to demonstrate significant advantages, to include: size, cost, at-sea reliability, greater hydrodynamic efficiency, survivability to sea-state, and survivability to adversary actions through stealth considerations and tampering resistance.' Last year, DARPA, in cooperation with the U.S. Navy, conducted a successful test of an at-sea refueling system developed to support the NOMARS mission. Two Navy USVs, the Ranger and the Mariner, which are converted offshore support vessels that retain the ability to operate in crewed mode, were used to demonstrate the refueling system. The US Navy's USVs Mariner, at rear, and Ranger, in front, sail together in 2023. USN 'Fueling at sea (FAS) for USVs presents a problem that needs to be solved as current FAS solutions use personnel to handle lines and hoses on the platform being refueled,' according to a press release DARPA put out in December. 'Requiring personnel on the USV for the operation adds significant constraints on USV design and operations, as the vessel must then be designed with considerations for safety of the humans on board, even if for a short period of time. It can also be risky and sometimes dangerous to transport personnel to a USV in rough seas or high winds.' 'For the recent test, USV Ranger carried a receiving station representative of the system that will be on the NOMARS USV Defiant, and USV Mariner carried a refueling 'mini-station,' custom-designed by NOMARS prime contractor Serco Inc,' the release added. 'While there were personnel aboard both vessels during the event, no people were involved with operations on the receiving side.' A picture DARPA released from the NOMARS fueling-at-sea test last year. DARPA However, Serco has already been actively pitching Defiant as at least a pathway to a range of operational capabilities, including new armed USVs and ones capable of acting as uncrewed logistics platforms. The company has already been working on a larger USV concept called Dauntless leveraging the work done under NOMARS, which could be armed with up to four ADLs, as well as carry other payloads. A model of the Dauntless USV concept depicted with four ADLs. Joseph Trevithick Defiant was also designed with ease of production in mind and Secro has previously told TWZ that the USVs could be produced outside of traditional shipyards, including by railworks, if needed. This could make the design, or future variants or derivatives thereof, very attractive to the U.S. Navy, which has been facing increasingly worrisome struggles to acquire traditional crewed warships. That has come amid broader concerns about U.S. shipyard capacity, or the lack thereof, for building new naval vessels and maintaining existing ones. The U.S. shipbuilding industry continues to be grossly outpaced by that of China, America's current chief global competitor, despite efforts to narrow the gap in recent years. Earlier this year, the Navy announced plans to simplify its USV acquisition strategy to focus on smaller, simpler, and more interchangeable designs rather than larger and exquisite ones. The service had previously been working toward fielding distinct fleets of MUSVs and LUSVs. The Navy's Mariner and Ranger USVs sail together with a Japanese Mogami class frigate. USN 'The designs already exist, and we must not over-spec this,' Rear Adm. William Daly, head of the Navy’s surface warfare division (N96), told an audience, including TWZ, at the Surface Navy Association’s annual symposium in January. 'We’ve also had sufficient funding and experimentation to date to know what we need.' 'Many of the payloads are ready and tested. [Concepts of operation] are coalescing,' Daly added. 'Let’s move faster. This is efficient, this is effective, and this is scalable.' DARPA's NOMARS program, especially now with Defiant about to head off for its first at-sea demonstrations, looks set to be another important part of the U.S. military's uncrewed naval future.

‘Fighter Drone’ Designations Officially Assigned To Collaborative...	The U.S. Air Force has designated the drones that General Atomics and Anduril are currently developing as part of the first phase, or Increment 1, of the Collaborative Combat Aircraft program as the YFQ-42A and YFQ-44A, respectively. These appear to be the U.S. military's first ever 'fighter drone' designations. The Increment 1 CCAs are expected to work closely together with crewed combat jets primarily in the air-to-air combat role, at least initially. Chief of Staff of the Air Force Gen. David Allvin announced the YFQ-42A and YFQ-44A during a keynote address at the Air & Space Forces Association’s 2025 Warfare Symposium this evening, at which TWZ is in attendance. In the U.S. military-wide designation system for aircraft and missiles 'F' stands for 'fighter' and 'Q' stands for drone. The 'Y' at the front indicates a prototype design. A picture shown during Gen. Allvin's keynote of a model of General Atomics' CCA design with the YFQ-42A designation. USAF A picture of a model of Anduril CCA design along with the YFQ-44A designation that also accompanied Allvin's keynote. USAF Allvin did not make any mention of official nicknames to go along with the YFQ-42A and YFQ-44A designations. Anduril's internal name for its design is Fury. General Atomics does not appear to have given its CCA design a name, at least publicly. Interestingly, Blue Force Technologies, the company that originally started the development of Fury, displayed a test article with a notional YFQ-XX marking years ago. Anduril acquired Blue Force Technologies in 2023, and you read more about the story of how Fury came to be in this past in-depth TWZ feature.

A rendering behind also shows the drone armed with an AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile. Andrew Van Timmeren/LinkedIn 'Today, the Air Force announced the mission design series designation for Anduril’s CCA prototype: YFQ-44A,' Dr. Jason Levin, Senior Vice President of Engineering at Anduril Industries, said in a statement. 'Together, in close partnership with the Air Force, we are pioneering a new generation of semi-autonomous fighter aircraft that is fundamentally transforming air dominance by delivering highly capable, mass-producible, more affordable, and more autonomous aircraft by the end of the decade.' The designation 'represents the first aircraft type of a YFQ designation, signaling a new era of uncrewed fighter aircraft,' Levin added. 'It reinforces what we already knew: our CCA is a high performance aircraft designed specifically for the air superiority mission, acting as a force multiplier for crewed aircraft within the real constraints of cost and time.' TWZ has also reached out to General Atomics for comment. As it stands now, the Air Force is looking to buy at least between 100 and 150 Increment 1 CCAs. In 2024, the service selected General Atomics and Anduril to proceed in what has ostensibly been a competition for the first batch of CCAs – Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman had also submitted designs – but it remains unclear whether it will ultimately acquire YFQ-42As, YFQ-44As, or a mix of both. As already noted, the primary mission of the first tranche of CCAs will be acting as flying 'missile trucks' supporting crewed combat jets, in line with the new FQ designations, at least to start. Electronic warfare and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions, as well as the ability to use the drones more indecently on their own missions, have also been discussed. Additional views of models of General Atomics CCA design, at top, and Anduril's Fury, below. General Atomics/Jamie Hunter The Air Force is also in the process of refining requirements for additional drones as part of Increment 2 of the CCA program. The CCAs in the second tranche are expected to be more expensive than those in the first, though the exact capability mix they might have and what missions they might be tailored for are still unknown. The service has said in the past that it could acquire as many as 1,000 CCAs, or more, in total. The Air Force is very much still exploring how it will incorporate CCAs into its concepts of operations and overall force structure, but Gen. Allvin and other service officials consistently say they expect the drones have a transformative impact. 'We're looking at different ways to execute the same mission. We're going beyond just single platforms equal single things,' Allvin said in his keynote tonight. 'Maybe there's different ways to provide combat effects, understanding what that is, embracing and leaning into human machine teaming, understanding what autonomy can actually do for us, knowing that's going to be a part of our future.' 'And now we have two prototypes of Collaborative Combat Aircraft that were on paper less than a couple of years ago,' the Air Force's top officer continued. 'They're going to be ready to fly this summer. &#8230; we are leaning into a new chapter of aerial warfare.' Whatever the Air Force's initial CCA force looks like in the end, what have now been dubbed the YFQ-42A and YFQ-44A look set to have historic impact on how the service fights in the future.

F-22 Raptors Completed Six Test Flights For New Sensor Upgrades	Lockheed Martin says it conducted six successful flight tests last year as part of work to add new capabilities on the F-22 Raptor stealth fighter. The U.S. Air Force's small, but highly capable and heavily in-demand F-22 fleet is set to receive a number of upgrades to help keep the jets at the very tip of the service's spear, potentially into the 2040s. This includes a new Infrared Defensive System (IRDS), as well as other additional sensors and stealthy range-extending drop tanks. Representatives from Lockheed Martin provided an update on the F-22 program, as well as other company efforts, to TWZ and other outlets at the Air & Space Forces Association's 2025 Warfare Symposium, which kicked off today. At present, the Air Force has just over 180 Raptors in service, 32 of which are in an older configuration and relegated to test and training duties as a result. An F-22 test jet. USAF 'We are all very keen to understand and recognize the need for air combat platforms that go farther to sense and see farther and to shoot farther,' Mike Shoemaker, Lockheed Martin's Vice President & General Manager of its Integrated Fighter Group, said. 'And so, we've been partnering with the Air Force. And last year, we completed six successful flight test demos for advanced sensors [to] extend the Raptor’s ability to detect, track, ID, and eventually target, at range – I'll say tactically significant ranges – so it gives them the advantage in any fight.' Shoemaker did not provide more specific details about the 'advanced sensors' being added to the F-22. Raptors, as well as sensor testbed aircraft, have been observed flying with stealthy underwing pods for years now. Those pods are widely understood to be part of plans to integrate an infrared search and track (IRST) capability onto the jets. This would align with Shoemaker's comments here and is something we will come back in a moment. A F-22 seen with the stealthy underwing pods in 2022. James Reeder N33TR arrives with the F-22 pod after a test flight over the Eglin ranges. pic.twitter.com/K11EHm3n0x&mdash; 𝙎𝙍_𝙋𝙡𝙖𝙣𝙚𝙨𝙥𝙤𝙩𝙩𝙚𝙧 (@SR_Planespotter) January 17, 2025 'Also recently on contract to integrate the next-generation infrared defensive measure systems on the F-22, which give it upgraded missile warning capability and long-range detection,' Shoemaker added. 'So both of these are increasing Raptor's lethality and survivability.' What Shoemaker is talking about here is the IRDS contract, which Lockheed Martin announced in January. The company has already said that IRDS will feature a distributed sensor array leveraging the TacIRST system, which was unveiled back in 2022. TacIRST sensors, at least as they have been shown to date, feature a compact staring-type design with a fixed field of view. F-5 Advanced Tiger aggressor jets belonging to private contractor Tactical Air Support (TacAir) are the only aircraft known to have an integrated TacIRST system currently. A TacAir F-5AT aggressor jet equipped with a TacIRST sensor (circled in red). Tactical Air Support Shoemaker's comments today indicate that the 'advanced sensor' capability that the F-22 is set to receive is distinct from the IRDS. Having additional, dedicated IRST capability in podded form on top of IRDS would make a certain amount of sense, and TWZ previously posited this could be the case. Traditional IRSTs, both ones integrated into aircraft and carried in pods, have historically had larger aperture sensors in gimbal mounts with flexible fields of view, unlike what TacIRST offers. In 2017, Ken Merchant, then Lockheed Martin Vice President for the F-22 program, also told what is now Air & Space Forces Magazine that 'we really don’t have the real estate' to install an IRST system, at least one akin to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter's Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS), inside the Raptor. EOTS, which is primarily a sensor for air-to-ground targeting, has an infrared search and track function, as well. Just by itself, IRDS sounds like it will offer a major improvement over the F-22's existing AN/AAR-56 Missile Launch Detector (MLD) system, which currently offers spherical infrared threat warning. The distributed array of TacIRST sensors might also be able to help provide additional overall situational awareness and other capabilities broadly similar to what the F-35's Distributed Aperture System (DAS) and other DAS-like setups offer. Integrated and podded IRST capabilities together would also be a valuable combination. As TWZ has previously explained: 'IRSTs, in general, are typically only able to instantaneously determine a target’s angle and bearing, and track it, with it taking more effort to determine its range using just a single sensor platform. Two IRST sensors on separate aircraft that are networked together can instantly triangulate the target’s range, which can then provide more robust engagement-quality target tracks. Lockheed Martin has demonstrated this kind of networked IRST capability in combination with its Legion Pod in the past and it is a common practice for aircraft equipped with advanced IRST capabilities. The IRST21 sensor used on the Legion Pod, as well as in other podded configurations, is a more traditional gimbaled type, as you can read more about here.' An abstract graphical depiction of two podded IRST sensors working networked together. Lockheed Martin No matter how the IRST capabilities are integrated into the F-22 in the end, it is something the Raptor was supposed to have originally, but was cut ostensibly for budgetary reasons late in the jet's development. There has been a global resurgence of interest in IRST systems in recent years, especially within the U.S. military, due in large part to the benefits they offer over traditional radars for spotting and tracking stealthy targets. IRSTs can also help cue radars to targets of interest, and fused data from these, as well as passive radiofrequency sensors, can produce higher-quality target tracks, enhance situational awareness, and help with positive target identification. In addition, IRSTs are passive sensors that can be used without pumping out signals that could alert an opponent to the fact that it has been detected and is being tracked. Signals from active sensors like radars can also make friendly aircraft easier for enemy forces to spot. IRSTs are also immune to ever-growing electronic warfare threats. 'All of our engineering work and design work that's done will ensure that we preserve the stealth capabilities of the [F-22] platform,' Lockheed Martin's Shoemaker noted today. Stealth aircraft, crewed and uncrewed, as well as stealthy munitions, are increasingly part of the threat ecosystem U.S. forces expect to face, especially in any future high-end fight. China, in particular, is making major strides in this arena, and just showed off two previously unseen stealth combat jet designs in December. pic.twitter.com/IZ9BlwjoOc&mdash; Justin Bronk (@Justin_Br0nk) December 26, 2024 pic.twitter.com/BKHGVbRIbn&mdash; OedoSoldier (@OedoSoldier) December 26, 2024 'As I said, one of the things we think you've got to be able to do is to sense and see farther,' Lockheed Martin's Shoemaker also said today. 'And if it can now see and sense farther, it can also share that information.' The F-22's ability to function as a highly capable 'quarterback' for larger aerial force packages is something TWZ has highlighted multiple times in the past. Lockheed Martin, together with the Air Force and other industry partners, has also been working to expand the Raptor's communications capabilities in recent years. USAF Lockheed Martin says the Raptor was the first combat aircraft to make full use of a software-defined open mission systems architecture to make it faster and easier, in general, to integrate new and improved functionality. A new software baseline configuration for the F-22 called Release 4 is in the final stages of testing now, and the hope is that it will be cleared for loading onto the fleet by the end of this Spring, according to Shoemaker. This will also make it even easier to integrate third-party 'apps' into the Raptor mission systems. 'I think, right now, we're looking at the next couple of years for when that will actually be delivered to the fleet,' Shoemaker added about the timeline for the Raptor's new sensor capabilities in response to a direct question from TWZ's Howard Altman. In the meantime, the F-22 fleet continues to be very much in demand. 'Our Lockheed Martin team has supported significant increases in both operations and deployments,' Shoemaker said today. 'With this relatively small fleet size and over … half a million flying hours, those come with unique challenges.' 'But even with that pace, this aircraft won't require any major structural improvements or upgrades to last well into the 2040s,' he continued. A slide highlighting recent F-22 program highlights and achievements that accompanied remarks from Mike Shoemaker, Lockheed Martin's Vice President &#038; General Manager of its Integrated Fighter Group, today. Lockheed Martin How long the F-22s will continue to serve is an open question tied directly to the uncertain fate of the Air Force's plans for a new crewed sixth-generation combat jet as part of the larger Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative. Last year, the service conducted a deep review of the NGAD combat jet, originally envisioned as a Raptor replacement, and there are clear indications that the resulting analysis favors continuing as originally planned. However, there are serious concerns about the affordability of the NGAD combat jet, especially when taking into account other top-tier modernization priorities, including stealthy aerial refueling tankers and Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones. The ballooning cost of the Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile program was a key factor in launching the NGAD review in the first place. The optimal size of the B-21 Raider stealth bomber fleet is also currently under debate. USAF The entire Department of Defense is now also facing down the prospect of major cuts to existing programs to help redirect resources to new priorities under President Donald Trump's administration, including the Golden Dome missile defense initiative. For its part, Lockheed Martin still sees upgraded F-22s as a bridge to whatever next-generation air combat platform comes next. Raptor modernization work has already been feeding into NGAD. The F-22 fleet does look to have many years, if not decades of service still ahead of it, buoyed by a long-promised and ever-more important IRST capability and other upgrades.

Notorious Abandoned Pacific Island Outpost Eyed For Space Force R...	The U.S. Space Force is looking at reactivating an abandoned rocket launching site on an abandoned Pacific island stronghold to test technologies for future rocket cargo delivery missions. The site, on Johnston Atoll in the North Pacific Ocean, around 860 miles southwest of Hawaii, has a notorious history involving nuclear, chemical and biological weapons but is now earmarked for the potential construction of two landing pads. This is part of the Rocket Cargo Vanguard program, which seeks to use rockets to move military supplies from one point on Earth to another much more rapidly than is currently possible. The confirmation of the plans for Johnston Atoll was provided in a notice of intent (NOI) published today by the Department of the Air Force (DAF), which includes the Air Force and Space Force. The NOI serves to 'advise the public of the pending preparation of an Environmental Assessment (EA)' for the two landing pads. The assessment will evaluate the impacts of the construction and operation of the two landing pads on the atoll, which will provide for up to 10 reentry vehicle landings per year over four consecutive years. Potentially, the testing could begin as early as this year. U.S. Air Force concept artwork shows how a cargo rocket might be used to enable rapid delivery of aircraft-size payloads for agile global logistics — in this example, for urgent humanitarian assistance and disaster response. U.S. Air Force illustration/Randy Palmer Specifically, according to the NOI, the purpose of the planned campaign is 'to safely test and demonstrate the expeditious delivery of tons of materiel through space in support of ongoing research, development, test, and experimentation' under the Rocket Cargo Vanguard program — which is also known as Point-to-Point Delivery (P2PD). Led by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rocket Cargo Vanguard is a science and technology effort to determine the viability and utility of using large commercial rockets for Department of Defense global logistics. Sometimes under different names and terminology, the project dates back to at least 2020, at least in the public realm. 'Current military modes of transportation require days to weeks of planning and logistics to provide materiel to distant locations at the time and place of need,' the NOI continues. 'The Proposed Action would explore the military utility of this technology to address rapid global mobility challenges by leveraging commercial technology to mature critical capabilities.' The same document states that Johnston Atoll was selected for possible use in the Rocket Cargo Vanguard program since the location must be 'remote, securable, U.S. Government-controlled, capable of air or maritime transport of personnel and materiel and support the disposition and removal of reentry vehicles via barged transport.' Other locations that were considered and then rejected included Kwajalein Atoll, Midway Island, and Wake Island. All of these are U.S. Pacific territories, with Kwajalein already being established as a highly important test facility. 'Upon further examination, the DAF concluded that Johnston Atoll is the only location that meets all operational requirements over the duration of the four-year reentry and landing test program.' A U.S. Air Force aerial view of Johnston Atoll, dating from 1990. U.S. Air Force Photo SSgt. Val Gempis SSGT Val Gempis Johnston Atoll, which is an unincorporated U.S. territory surrounded by ocean, 'was identified as the safest and most viable location.' This is likely also a reference to the potential impact of climate change and severe weather events. Notably, Kwajalein is still recovering from the effects of 'weather-driven waves' that caused 'significant damage' across the island early in 2024. The environmental assessment will now consider the impact of the proposed testing on Johnston Atoll, which is now designated as a National Wildlife Refuge — a classification brings its own set of criteria in terms of the impact on local biodiversity — and part of the Pacific Islands Heritage Marine National Monument. Composite satellite image of Johnston Atoll, from 2009. NASA At the same time, Johnston Atoll has a long and highly controversial history of U.S. military activities, including being used as a naval refueling depot, an air base, a test site for nuclear and biological weapons, as well as for rockets and missiles, and a site for the storage and disposal of chemical weapons. In one highly notable event, the island hosted the Starfish Prime high-altitude nuclear test in July 1962, which was the largest nuclear test conducted in outer space. Many other nuclear tests occurred at and high above the atoll from 1958 to 1975. The base has been effectively abandoned by the U.S. military since 2003, when the Army finally completed its work on decommissioning and dismantling chemical weapons on the island, as well as the related environmental cleanup. A large 9,000-foot closed runway and other abandoned infrastructure are still present on the contaminated island that has no human occupants. The desolate outpost, located deep in the Pacific, has drawn some attention in recent years as there has been suggestions that it would be reactivated as part of sweeping upgrade projects across airfields in the Pacific as contingency preparation for a war with China. An official video marking the final elimination of the chemical weapons stockpile at Johnston Atoll in November 2000. The Johnston Atoll Chemical Agent Disposal System (JACADS) destroyed a total of 412,798 chemical weapons: It was initially revealed in 2020 that the U.S. military was working with SpaceX, alongside other industry partners, on plans for cargo delivery by rocket. At that time, U.S. Army Gen. Stephen R. Lyons, previously commander of U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM), said that the Pentagon was aiming to develop technology that would allow the cargo-weight equivalent of a C-17 Globemaster III (roughly 85.5 tons) to be delivered anywhere in the world within an hour. A slide from U.S. Army Gen. Stephen R. Lyons’ virtual presentation in 2020. TRANSCOM By 2021, the Air Force’s budget proposal for Fiscal Year 2022 requested additional funding for what was then being termed as the Rocket Cargo program. At this point, the Pentagon’s stated plans included transporting payloads of up to 100 tons, including cargo and potentially personnel, via orbital or suborbital profiles to forward locations. The program was assigned Vanguard status also in 2021, the implications of which we discussed at the time. By early 2022, the AFRL had awarded SpaceX a five-year, $102 million contract to collect flight data from its Starship program in order to demonstrate technologies for point-to-point cargo and humanitarian aid transportation. The complete Starship reusable launch vehicle system, as TWZ has highlighted in the past, comprises a super-heavy rocket booster and spacecraft. So far, however, Starship test efforts have yielded mixed results. In April of 2023, the inaugural Starship flight test resulted in the super-heavy rocket exploding just minutes after launching, In the latest flight test, the seventh, which took place in January of this year, Starship ended with the vehicle exploding after a propellant leak prompted the autonomous flight safety system to self-destruct it. SpaceX Starship integrated flight test 2 at the Starbase facility along the south Texas coast on November 18, 2023. SpaceX via X/Twitter The Air Force has said it expects a full demonstration of the rocket cargo concept by 2026. This depends on successful flight testing of Starship before that point, not to mention overcoming other significant technical obstacles. Ultimately, however, the Pentagon is set on at least investigating the potential of rockets for rapidly delivering cargo across significant distances. In particular, such a capability would appear to have particular relevance in the context of future contingencies in the Indo-Pacific theater. With a growing expectation that this region will see a future high-end conflict involving U.S. forces, perhaps even before 2026, being able to call upon rockets to quickly bring critical supplies to the area would be of huge value — provided, once again, that the technology can be mastered. The NOI doesn’t specify what rockets will be used in the planned Rocket Cargo Vanguard tests, although there are strong indications that the Space Force is eyeing SpaceX’s Starship for future rocket cargo delivery missions. 'We are thinking about how we might use it,' Lt. Gen. Philip Garrant, the commander of Space Systems Command, said last November in reference to Starship. 'We think the first, most logical, given the payload volume … would be some type of rocket cargo delivery mechanism,' he added. '[We are] absolutely interested in the potential military utility and definitely following their progress.' U.S. Space Force Lt. Gen. Philip Garrant, Space Systems Command commander, and U.S. Space Force Col. Mark Shoemaker, Space Launch Delta 30 commander, at Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, March 20, 2024. U.S. Space Force photo by Senior Airman Kadielle Shaw In early 2024, it emerged that the Pentagon had approached SpaceX with a view to purchasing Starship launch vehicle systems, specifically for sensitive, high-risk missions. Since Rocket Cargo Vanguard seeks to rapidly deliver cargo, and possibly personnel, anywhere on Earth that can support a landing, the Starship is an obvious candidate for the mission. It’s the largest and most powerful rocket ever flown, according to the company, and is reportedly capable of carrying up to 150 metric tons while being fully reusable. At the same time, it’s capable of landing vertically, making it suitable for a much wider range of landing sites. It remains to be seen whether Johnston Atoll will be resurrected as a test site for the Rocket Cargo Vanguard program, although the results of the environmental assessment are due next month. Potentially, approving the island for the program could pave the way for it becoming a site for other space vehicle landings beyond Rocket Cargo. Currently, there are few, if any,nuc locations in the continental United States that can support this. If it does become part of an expanding reusable space infrastructure, that will put additional emphasis on Johnston Atoll in general, too. Whatever happens, today’s announcement reinforces the fact that the U.S. military remains committed to at least exploring the possibility of fast-track cargo supply via space launch rockets in the future.

Top Aces F-16 Aggressors Getting Ability To Insert Synthetic Band...	As the Air & Space Forces Association’s annual Air Warfare Symposium kicks off today in Aurora, Colorado, private adversary air company Top Aces is previewing its new 'constructive wingman' capability which will begin test and evaluation on its F-16A/B aggressor aircraft starting this Spring. The constructive wingman is essentially a synthetic aircraft that Top Aces’ F-16 aggressor pilots can control from their cockpits. It is inserted digitally into the sensor 'pictures' of both the aggressors and the aircraft training against it. While there is no aircraft physically added to the aerial engagement, to aircrews involved, it appears as real on their cockpit displays. The artificial intelligence and algorithms that comprise the constructive wingman are based on software developed by EpiSci (now merged into Applied Intuition), a company which TWZ has covered in relation to its work with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Alpha Dogfight program and subsequent live-flight augmented reality dogfights with AI agents. Adding one or more synthetic wingmen to a red air sortie complicates the tactical picture for the blue forces which train against Top Aces aggressors and can do so at very little cost. Among its activities, the company provides aggressor training through the Air Force’s Combat Air Force Contracted Air Support (CAFCAS) program to F-35 pilots going through Formal Training Units (FTUs) at both Eglin Air Force Base in Florida and at Luke AFB in Arizona. F-16s from Top Aces refueling alongside Luke-based F-35s. (USAF) Students at both locations go through an eight month B-course (basic course) as they transition to the F-35, learning to employ its deep capabilities in a variety of missions including offensive/defensive air to air. In beyond visual range (BVR) scenarios the extra synthetic aircraft which Top Aces is planning to introduce represent more targets for the new F-35 students to grapple with and larger and more varied formations than they would typically see with only live aircraft or in fully simulated training environments. It also fits in with the USAF's push to more deeply integrate seamless live, virtual, and constructive training, which you can read all about in our previous explainer here. Live And Constructive Aircraft Pump Up Real World Stress The War Zone spoke with Top Aces’ vice president of business development, Brian 'Taz' Delemater, and the company’s director of enterprise technology, Aaron 'Fang' Steffens, about the added training value that the constructive wingman capability could offer. As Fang Steffens acknowledges, seeing expanded formations of mixed real and synthetic adversary aircraft, which all appear as legitimate target tracks, while actually in the air ratchets up psychological pressure on blue force students that simulated environments cannot. 'That’s the thing about live training. There are so many things you can and want to do in a virtual environment right now, especially high-end tactics. But we don’t think there’s a replacement for live training with real airplanes out there. It changes the dynamic on how the student, or even an experienced instructor, is thinking when moving at speed. There are other live aircraft out there that are trying to shoot you and there’s an element of risk.' Mixing constructive and live aircraft in an airborne training environment could provide highly valuable lessons for F-35 pilots who often train in flight simulators to replicate fifth-generation adversary threats and threat environments which cannot easily be recreated in the real world. The War Zone has extensively covered Top Aces in recent years, detailing its operations and its acquisition of ex-Israeli Air Force F-16A/B Netz fighters, as well as the capabilities it has added to them. These include active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars, infra-red search and track (IRST) systems, and a proprietary open mission system which it calls the Advanced Aggressor Mission System (AAMS). But it’s important to point out that these capabilities reside in just a handful of Top Aces’ F-16s, which the company refers to as its F-16 AAF (Advanced Aggressor Fighter). Top Aces began receiving the ex-Israeli aircraft in 2021, eventually acquiring 29 of the fighters. By mid-2025, 14 of these will be airworthy and mission-ready. As of now, four jets are configured to the AAF standard including Link-16 datalinks and a Thales Visionix Gen III Scorpion helmet-mounted display system (HMDS), in addition to the capabilities mentioned above. Obviously, AAF jet use is at a premium which is why they are heavily tasked with aggressor training for fifth-generation blue forces. Top Aces has stationed four of its F-16s at Eglin and another four at Luke. Two of the jets at each location are AAFs. Adding constructive wingman capability to these would effectively increase the number of enemies Top Aces can present to F-35 students in a given sortie. How It Works Top Aces has developed constructive wingman software through its own Patuxent River, Maryland-based integration lab. Much of its work has centered on building out the pilot-vehicle interface for the new capability. The constructive wingman will be managed by Top Aces’ aggressor pilots through a multi-functional display (MFD) on the lower center pedestal panel in the cockpit rather than via a knee-mounted tablet display as has become common with other additive AI-based systems. Pilots will use standard HOTAS (hands on throttle and stick) controls to command the constructive wingman. Top Aces Viper cockpit. James Deboer The software is integrated through the company’s AAMS and the constructive wingman is presented via Link-16 data-link to the blue forces and other Top Aces aggressor aircraft. The F-16 AAF pilot sees his constructive wingman on his MFD 'just like you would see a radar track or anything else' Steffens explains. Before engaging during a red air sortie, the Top Aces pilot sets up the constructive wingman for desired formation offset and spacing. The virtual aircraft can be put into any kind of formation to give a beyond visual range look that matches the sortie training objectives. 'This is the same way that we would look to direct a manned or unmanned live wingman,' Steffens says. His mention of unmanned aircraft is purposeful. An image showing the Advanced Aggressor Fighter F-16’s multi-function display capability screen. It provides high-situational awareness displaying information from the radar and other onboard sensors as well as from other platforms via data-link. Tracks are also projected in the pilot’s Scorpion helmet-mounted display system. It also shows weapons engagement envelopes for threat profile simulation., James DeBoer Taz Delemater explains that Top Aces sees its constructive wingman capability as a possible prelude to training with mixed manned-unmanned formations using the same control methodology. The concept of unmanned aggressor aircraft, called ADAIR-UX, was viewed with enthusiasm a couple of years ago as TWZ highlighted but has since been overtaken by the increased focus on collaborative combat aircraft (CCAs). But unmanned aggressors may yet find favor. Until such time, Top Aces reckons that its constructive wingman could add immediate value and experience which may later translate to some form of ADAIR-UX. After configuring his constructive wingman, the Top Aces pilot will give general commands to it on how to engage blue forces. 'You’re telling him to be West, now turn ‘hot’, to drag-out,' Steffens says, 'those kinds of higher level directions just like you would give to a live F-16 wingman, you just cue them through the hands-on throttle and stick [controls].' The AI engine then 'flies' the constructive wingman, maneuvering the synthetic sensor target with faithful kinematics. The AAF pilot can see the maneuvering as part of the friend-foe target tracks on the F-16’s MFD. Blue force F-35s see the same combination of maneuvering real and synthetic aggressor aircraft on their displays. The constructive wingman is transmitted from the Top Aces F-16 via Link-16 and appears as a real adversary aircraft in the F-35's missions systems and cockpit display. For a given sortie, Top Aces can change the kinematics of the constructive wingman as well. 'We could have it fly like an F-16, we could have it fly like a different type of adversary aircraft as well,' Delemater adds. Top Aces F-16s flying in formation. James DeBoer As a blue force-red force engagement proceeds and possibly closes to shorter-range, the constructive wingman may no longer populate the blue force/red force operating picture rendered via Link-16. That’s because physically merging with Top Aces’ constructive wingman is not possible. To ensure that any remaining synthetic targets disappear or are disregarded as red and blue forces physically merge, Steffens explains that, 'We would develop a plan with the blue lead or instructor of record and the range training officer [RTO] beforehand. If there is an RTO, which is usually the case, particularly for larger fights, they can handle it all in real time. If there’s no RTO, there are still ways to manage [the constructive aircraft] depending on the training scenario. Then any discrepancies would get ironed out in the debrief.' That would leave live aircraft to tackle the close-in fight if the training sortie calls for such a scenario, Steffens says. 'Then, they have the highly maneuverable live F-16s that they’re actually merging with.' Steffens adds that most of the B-course training flights that Top Aces does are scripted to provide targeted training to the F-35 student. Working out a plan in advance is common and not difficult. Given the one constructive wingman-per-AAF Viper capability, the current maximum four-ship formations that Top Aces can fly at Eglin and Luke could become six-ship formations - a flight of two standard F-16s and two AAF-configured F-16s that are also controlling two synthetic wingmen. However, Delemater told TWZ that a future iteration of the constructive wingman software may allow one F-16 to project/control two synthetic aircraft. As experience with the constructive agents is gained, the company will be able to assess what sort of workload directing two synthetic targets would impart to pilots. Such experience may eventually extrapolate to cockpit control of unmanned aggressor aircraft as well. 'We’re going to continue to develop the capability,' Delemater affirms. 'A lot of it depends on how OT&E goes and the feedback from the customer.' The Value Proposition Top Aces executives point out that the constructive wingman effort is entirely driven and funded by the company and its partners, including EpiSci, which Top Aces has an ownership stake in. As things stand, there is no U.S. Air Force or Navy requirement for contract aggressor-generated constructive target capability. But if the company can demonstrate enough bang for the training buck, the services might become interested. Real aggressor aircraft and pilots are extremely expensive, if essential, training tools. Added constructive capability could stretch the return on investment from training beyond presenting taller challenges to blue forces. Simple math illustrates the cost efficiency potentially gained with constructive wingman capability. Top Aces declined to share information on the cost of operating its F-16 AAFs with TWZ but some rough estimation is possible. Fang Steffens confirmed that the average red air sortie for Top Aces F-16s has a 1.3 to 1.6 hour duration based on factors such as transit distance to ranges and time in afterburner. According to recent estimates, the USAF cost per flight hour (CPFH) of operating an F-16C is approximately $27,000. Using this number and given a 90-minute aggressor training flight, the cost of flying an aggressor F-16 may be on the order of $40,500 per average sortie. Top Aces F-16 flies off the wing of a tanker. (USAF) It’s worth noting that contracted red air support is traditionally less expensive all-in than the cost of organic red air support with a similar aircraft from within the service, but many factors impact cost. Regardless, it’s not massively different as fuel and maintenance and other primary factors are what they are for a given type. So, adding another F-16 or two could cost an additional $40,000-$80,000 per sortie. Top Aces’ potential fee for adding constructive wingman capability is unknown but the cost is theoretically a tiny fraction of flying one or two additional real aircraft, and this would largely be up-front investment for Top Aces, not a high per-sortie expense. 'For the price of one F-16, they’re going to get two,' Delemater asserts. Steffens adds that 'at range, they can get multiple targets for the price of one.' Zoom out and look at the total expense of adding real vs. synthetic targets across the F-35 B-course syllabus and the cost differential should grow markedly in favor of the constructive wingman. Top Aces distinguishes their EpiSci AI-driven constructive wingman from other synthetic entities because it can be manipulated from the cockpit rather than by an operator typically on the ground. Eliminating the need for ground control of the constructive wingman and shifting it to the cockpit potentially represents further savings. Top Aces has yet to formally brand or name the capability because of copyright concerns. The company was on the precipice of previewing its constructive wingman at last September’s AFA Air, Space & Cyber Conference in Washington DC, planning to use the moniker 'Red 5.' But a release on the capability was pulled, partly out of concern about copyright infringement. According to Top Aces’ vice president of business development, that was not the only reason. Taz Delemater said the constructive wingman was and is awaiting clearance from DoD to use specific Link-16 transceivers to facilitate its function. He added that the (USAF) customer 'hasn’t been in a rush' to add the capability. 'We also thought that maybe it would make more sense to wait until we were closer to being able to truly demo this.' Demonstration will unfold within what Top Aces refers to as a series of operational test and evaluation flights slated for some time this Spring. The Air Force will likely sit-in on these flights, which will be done from Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. If the capability is appealing enough, the service could build it in as a requirement for the CAFCAS program. That could lead to introducing it elsewhere. Asked whether Top Aces views its constructive wingman as a value-add for advanced training exercises like Red Flag or the recent Bamboo Eagle, Steffens replied in the affirmative. 'We’re a deployable exercise force. We do that quite a bit with our customers in multiple exercises and we could bring this constructive wingman capability with us.' Top Aces F-16s at their headquarters in Mesa, Arizona. James Deboer Top Aces might also bring the capability to overseas customers. At least one of the company’s A-4N Skyhawks based at Wittmundhafen in northern Germany has been upgraded to full AAF status with the AESA, IRST and AAMS capabilities that its quartet of AAF F-16s have. Adding constructive wingman capability to more of these aircraft would make sense, Steffens says. 'If you think about it, there are going to be 600 F-35s over there. The ability to train against more targets at range and still have live assets out there for all the reasons we’ve discussed would have value overseas as well.' If the constructive wingman is adopted for aggressor training in the U.S. and abroad, its presence won’t be obvious. While the IRST pods, special antennas, and pilots wearing the Scorpion helmet-mounted displays that signal AAF aircraft might be discernible, the software that enables the constructive wingman is as physically invisible. The outcome of its potential success may one day be seen by the naked eye if the constructive wingman experience leads Top Aces on a path to realizing an ADAIR-UX-like capability. 'Our company still believes that there’s a significant benefit to moving forward with unmanned aircraft in an adversary training environment,' Steffens concludes.
