F/A-18F Shot Down By Friendly Cruiser Was In The Middle Of A Refu...	A U.S. Navy F/A-18F Super Hornet was conducting a refueling mission over the Red Sea when it was downed in a friendly fire incident this past weekend. The Ticonderoga class USS Gettysburg fired on the jet for reasons that are now under investigation. That cruiser also happens to be the first of its class to have gone through a deep modernization program that includes significant upgrades to its air defense suite, making it the most advanced operational example of its dwindling class. 'The [F/A-18F] aircraft is part of Carrier Airwing (CVW) 1 and was performing a refueling mission,' the Navy's Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) said in a statement to TWZ earlier today. We have reached out for further clarification about whether the two-seat Super Hornet was acting as the tanker and/or whether it was linked to another aircraft at the time of the shoot down. The Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Gettysburg. USN USS Gettysburg engaged and brought down the F/A-18F on December 22 local time, according to a previously released statement from U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM). Gettysburg and CVW-1 are both currently assigned to the Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group. Truman, its air wing, and its escorts had just entered the Red Sea last week. The strike group is currently supporting operations to protect and friendly military assets from attacks by Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen, including strikes ashore.

'Initial assessments indicate that one of the crew members sustained minor injuries. This incident was not the result of hostile fire, and a full investigation is underway.' 'Pilots' here looks to be a misnomer. The individual flying in the backseat of an F/A-18F is typically a Weapon Systems Officer (WSO), not a second pilot, and this was reportedly the case in this instance, according to The Washington Post's Dan Lamothe. Lamothe also reported, citing an anonymous military official, that a Standard Missile-2 (SM-2) was the weapon Gettysburg fired that brought down the Super Hornet, that the two crew members had both suffered minor injuries, and that the Navy considering whether or not to recover the wreckage. 3) Navy was assessing Sunday whether to salvage any of the downed jet, and how. 4) The two aviators are back aboard the aircraft carrier Truman with minor injuries. Those would not be uncommon after an ejection.&mdash; Dan Lamothe (@DanLamothe) December 22, 2024 The SM-2 family is a key element of the Navy's arsenal of ship-launched surface-to-air missiles. Since October 2023, SM-2s have been weapons of choice for U.S. naval forces in the Middle East for engaging Houthi missiles and drones. In addition, Ticonderoga class cruisers currently act as the central air and missile defense node for Navy carrier strike group. Whether or not to attempt to retrieve any portion of the downed F/A-18F will be an important question for the Navy. As TWZ has highlighted many times in the past, adversaries could try to do the same and glean useful intelligence from whatever they recover. When it comes to refueling mission, F/A-18 Super Hornets are currently routinely employed as tankers for other aircraft in Navy carrier air wings, typically flying stable orbits relatively close to the strike group for recovery operations, but are also used to refuel jets after launch or on their way to their objectives. They execute this in the '5-wet' configuration, with four 480-gallon fuel tanks and a centerline hose-and-drogue refueling pod. The services plans to supplant Super Hornets in this role with a new fleet of MQ-25 Stingray aerial refueling drones, which will also have secondary intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities and could take on other missions in the future. Unfortunately, the MQ-25 program has been beset by delays and other issues and Stingrays are not expected to begin flying operational missions until at least 2026. Land-based tanker aircraft also regularly support Navy carrier-based aircraft. While few other details regarding this past weekend’s friendly fire incident have emerged, a lot of things can go wrong and cause fratricide in such an environment, according to Bradley Martin, a retired Surface Warfare Officer (SWO) who spent two-thirds of his 30-year Navy career at sea. 'Aircraft might not have had its identification on,' he told TWZ Monday. 'The profile that was being reported in the Aegis system might have looked like a threat, so the operators are looking at it and trying to determine what they’re seeing and make a decision in fairly short order.' Battle management combat systems like Aegis are not perfect, Martin said. 'They occasionally misreport things or cause dual tracks, or they’ll not correctly identify something,' he continued, adding that sometimes it’s a combination of equipment and operator error. Near-misses happen 'all the time,' Martin added, where an operator is looking at a screen and trying to figure out what they are seeing in a very short period of time. 'Especially when you’re dealing with a wartime environment,' he noted. ‘The Navy’s fired a lot of missiles in the last year, more than it has in decades.' TWZ has previously noted how the Houthi's very active campaign targeting ships in and around the Red Sea, combined with the congested nature of the operating environment in the region, raises the risks of accidental shootdowns. Just in February, a German Navy warship sailing in the Red Sea fired on a U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone, but did not bring it down, in a case of mistaken identity. There are many other instances of aircraft being accidentally damaged or shot down, especially in the midst of active conflicts. The now-decommissioned Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Vincennes was involved in a particularly infamous incident in the midst of the Iran-Iraq War in 1988 where it shot down Iran Air Flight 655, killing everyone onboard. Issues with the Aegis Combat System's user interface at the time, as well as stress, timing, and confusion, have been cited as contributing factors. Thanks to a major upgrade program, the Aegis system on Gettysburg is one of the most modern currently in service, as you can read more about here. Unlike Vincennes in 1988, the cruiser also has the benefit of a much more advanced overall sensor suite with deep networking and sensor fusion capabilities on top of its far more advanced Aegis system. Decades of evolutionary enhancements have made it a very different combination of capabilities than it was nearly four decades ago. At the same time, we don't know what systems were operating on the ship at the time of the friendly fire incident this weekend or what other sources of data, such as from an E-2 Hawkeye airborne early warning and control aircraft and other ships in the region, that might have been available to feed into the crew's overall picture of the battlespace. E-2 Hawkeye airborne early warning and control aircraft. Northrop Grumman As the retired SWO Martin highlighted, the current situation U.S. forces are contending with in the Red Sea is an extremely high-threat environment with multiple layers of threats, some of which can be very hard to detect and categorize. The Houthis are actively targeting American warships, as well as commercial vessels, with various aerial drones, cruise missiles, anti-ship ballistic missiles and unmanned surface vessels, often simultaneously. The available time in which to make potentially serious decisions can be measured in seconds. The friendly fire incident also shined a new and unwelcome light on the Ticonderoga class's woes, including when it comes the much-maligned modernization program for a handful of the remaining ships. The original plan had been to substantially upgrade 11 of the cruisers, which would serve in the 2030s. The Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Chosin seen in the process of being upgraded. USN However, as it stands now, only three Ticonderogas will be modernized – USS Gettysburg, USS Chosin, and USS Cape St. George – and they may only deploy once more each before their scheduled decommissioning dates in the coming years. A report from GAO, a Congressional watchdog, published earlier this month, described the cruiser modernization effort as a poster child for how not to run such an effort, saying that around $1.84 billion had been wasted on modifications to ships that never returned to sea. The report also highlighted issues with Gettysburg, specifically, post-modernization and in the run-up to its current deployment. 'USS Gettysburg completed its modernization, including sea trials, in February 2023. The Navy’s Board of Inspection and Survey determined the ship meets the minimum standard to get to sea,' according to GAO. 'However, in January 2024 the Navy’s Board of Inspection and Survey identified several outstanding issues during an inspection of the ship’s condition. For example, several elements of the weapons systems were inoperable or degraded and there were structural issues throughout the ship. Since the inspection, the Navy has addressed several of these issues and the ship completed 18 days at sea in June 2024 in preparation for deployment. During this time at sea, USS Gettysburg completed a successful missile launch and intercept using its updated combat systems software.' 'The Navy deployed USS Gettysburg in September 2024 with its carrier strike group. Prior to the deployment, the ship’s crew told us that parts continued to be a problem, including steering gears and hydraulic power unit solenoid valves, among others,' GAO's report added. 'To address this problem, the Navy used parts from the decommissioned cruisers. According to the ship’s crew, propulsion plant and electric system failures were key concerns for the USS Gettysburg deployment.' A view of USS Gettysburg from the ship's bow in October 2024. USN Petty Officer 2nd Class Kaitlin Young GAO said that the Navy was looking to see how Gettysburg performed on its latest deployment before making any decisions about whether to send it out again before decommissioning it. The service has long said now that the Ticonderoga class as a whole has become increasingly unreliable and the ships have been suffering from hull cracking and other structural issues for years already. It is important to stress again that the chain of events that led to Gettysburg bringing down the Super Hornet over the Red Sea remains unknown, including whether or not any issues with the ship itself played a role. 'This kind of mistake sadly is almost inevitable,' Martin, the retired SWO, told TWZ. 'A sky full of aircraft, some friendly, a lot not friendly, ships trying to sort out occasionally ambiguous situations under a great deal of time pressure. These things will almost inevitably occur.' Martin said everyone should recognize that these things can and do happen in an intense enough combat environment, and that the Navy needs to be transparent about what happened. 'The public, the media, me, would be willing to accept that these things happen, this was an accident and [the Navy] has done something to prevent it,' he said. 'Fortunately, in this case, it wasn’t a tragedy, it was just a loss of an expensive airplane.' The Navy is just at the start of its investigation into the friendly fire incident over the week and more details about exactly what happened could emerge as that effort gets more underway. As Martin notes, in this instance, thankfully the two aviators onboard the F/A-18F were able to safely eject.

Massive Uptick In Official Drone Sightings By Nuclear Power Plant...	The number of drone flyovers of nuclear plants for the entire year nearly doubled in one week, from December 10th to December 17th, according to data provided to The War Zone by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Between Jan. 1 and Dec.10, nuclear facility licensees reported a total of 15 drone events. As of about 1 p.m. Dec., 17, that number had jumped to 26, NRC spokesman Dave McIntyre told The War Zone on Friday in response to our query. While the timeline overlaps with a rash of drone sightings across the country and especially in the New Jersey area - including over military installations and energy infrastructure - it is unclear at the moment what, if any, connection there is to the dramatic increase in suspicious drone events over nuclear facilities. Salem Nuclear Power Plant (L, two domes) and Hope Creek Nuclear Generating Station reported a drone flyover on Dec. 14. It is one of 26 across the nation to have reported such an incident. (STAN HONDA/AFP via Getty Images) STAN HONDA '&#8230;before January 2024, nuclear power plant licensees voluntarily reported flyovers by uncrewed aerial systems, such as drones, to the Federal Aviation Administration; law enforcement (local and the FBI); and the NRC,' McIntyre told The War Zone. 'Because reporting was voluntary, our information may not reflect the total number of UAS overflights of nuclear power plants.' Once a flyover is reported, he added, 'the NRC provides the specifics to other agencies for follow-up, including the FBI. The NRC does not investigate this type of activity once it has been reported.' We reached out to the NRC, FBI, FAA and Department of Homeland Security for more context about these flyovers. We will update this story with any pertinent information provided. The most recent publicly known drone sightings were over the Public Service Energy & Gas (PSEG) Nuclear Salem and Hope Creek generating stations, located at Lower Alloways Creek Township, in Salem County, New Jersey. 'Yes, drones were seen in the vicinity of Salem and Hope Creek (they’re the same site) last weekend,' NRC spokesperson Diane Screnci told us on Dec. 20. She did not provide a specific date, but a PSE&G spokesperson issued a statement saying that a flyover occurred on Dec 14.

Salem is a dual unit pressurized water reactor and Hope Creek is a single unit boiling water reactor situated on the Delaware River. (STAN HONDA/AFP via Getty Images) STAN HONDA The Hope Creek generation station, which produces nearly half of the state's energy, was one of 22 facilities to have its airspace banned to drones by the Federal Aviation Administration on Dec. 18. You can see the full list of sites where the FAA issued temporary flight restrictions (TFR) in our story about that here. 'While DHS and our federal partners continue to see no evidence of a threat, the purpose of the TFR is to discourage drone flights around these areas, as requested by the critical infrastructure partners,' DHS said in a statement on Dec. 19. 'DHS and other security partners routinely request the FAA establish TFRs to restrict drone flights in areas where the drones could be unsafe or pose a security risk.' The restrictions affect drones operating below 400 feet and last until Jan. 17. There is always the possibility that the timeline could be extended or additional communities have their airspace similarly closed. Notice To Airmen (NOTAM) warning of TFRs for drone flights over the Hope Creek generation station (FAA) On Friday, the FAA issued 68 more TFRs across New York state. As with the New Jersey TFRs, these banned drone flights over energy infrastructure. 'At the request of federal security partners, the FAA published 30 Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs) prohibiting drone flights over critical New York infrastructure,' the FAA told us after the first 30 were issued. Another 38 were ordered later on Friday. 'On the NY TRFs, would refer you back to our statement and background we provided on the NJ TFRs,' DHS told us on Friday. 'We continue to assess there is no public safety threat relating to the reported drone sightings, and like in NJ, the FAA issued temporary flight restrictions over some critical infrastructure facilities in NY out of an abundance of caution.' Screenshot The day before, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul told the media that the action was 'purely precautionary; there are no threats to these sites.' Like the New Jersey TFRs, these ban virtually all drone operations below 400 feet in a one-mile radius. The restrictions last until Jan. 18. The FAA provided locations for the first 30 of those: Farragut Substation - Brooklyn, NY 4/9171 E 13th St. Substation - New York, NY 4/9167 EF Barrett Substation - Oceanside, NY 4/9192 Goethals Substation - Staten Island, NY 4/9186 Fresh Kills Substation - Staten Island, NY 4/9180 Roslyn Substation – Roslyn Heights, NY 4/9189 Newbridge Rd.

Substation – Glenwood Landing, NY 4/9214 Drone flights over nuclear facilities have been increasing over the years, nearly doubling from the 12 reported in 2019 to 23 reported last year, according to the data provided to us by the NRC. NRC In September 2019, America’s most powerful nuclear plant, the Palo Verde Nuclear Generation Station near Tonopah, Arizona experienced a rash of drone overflights. In a trove of documents and internal correspondences related to the event, NRC officials described the incident as a 'drone-a-palooza' and said that it highlighted concerns about the potential for a future 'adversarial attack' involving small unmanned aircraft and the need for defenses against them. You can read more about this from our exclusive story at the time here. The Palo Verde Nuclear Generation Station experienced several drone flyovers in September 2019. (Google Earth) The drastic increase in drones reported to be flying over nuclear power plants comes amid a growing frenzy over mysterious objects in the sky that came after we broke the story about incursions over Picatinny Arsenal in northern New Jersey. The FBI has stated that out of some 5,000 sighting reports, fewer than 100 merited further investigation. Still, the hysteria over drones has grown to the point where the FBI and New Jersey State Police had to plead with the public not to shoot lasers or bullets into the sky at any object flying overhead. The warning was not hypothetical. Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst officials told The War Zone that pilots of 15 fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft from Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst had reported being struck by lasers from the ground since Dec. 7. One of those pilots had to seek medical treatment but was quickly released, but all aircraft involved landed safely. All this comes as drone incursions are being reported over military bases at home and abroad. Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton in southern California confirmed to The War Zone on Tuesday that it had experienced multiple such incidents over its airspace in the past several days. It joins a growing list of military installations in the United States experiencing recent drone incursions, that also includes Hill Air Force Base in Utah, which reported drone incursions on Monday. Drones have also flown over Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio forcing the closure of its airspace, which we were the first to report and they intruded on Naval Weapon Station Earle’s airspace and several unknown aircraft recently followed a Coast Guard vessel. The airspace over Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio was closed earlier this month because of drone incursions. (Public domain) Last month, drones also appeared over four U.S. Air Force bases in the U.K., another story we first broke, and more recently also over Ramstein Air Base in Germany. Drone incursions over key U.S. bases and training ranges are nothing new, and The War Zone has been on the leading edge of covering this topic for years. TWZ broke the story of the major drone incursions over Langley AFB a year ago, which marked a major change in how the DoD was approaching this neglected threat. Other such incursions involving UAS have taken place off the U.S. coasts and, as well as military bases, key civilian infrastructure has also been visited by mysterious drones. As we have reported on repeatedly, including the aforementioned Palo Verde incident, drones pose a danger to energy infrastructure and nefarious and bizarre drone activity at such sites has been an ongoing issue. What appeared to be the first actual drone attack on a power facility in the U.S. happened in 2020, which raised red flags in the intelligence community. The large recent increase in drone flyovers is deeply concerning for several reasons. Even small drones can deliver payloads able to cause damage and flying over these sites can provide insights into security protocols and responses, as well as network vulnerabilities and more. While we don’t know for sure that there is any connection between the recent spike in nuclear site flyovers and the ongoing drone frenzy, there is certainly more attention being put on what is going on in the skies over these plants due to a the massive news story unfolding in New Jersey. But it clearly still merits further examination. We will stay on top of this situation and provide updates when warranted.

Ukrainian M1 Abrams Commander Talks Tank’s Major Vulnerabilities,...	Last week, several Russian first-person view (FPV) drones struck a U.S.-made M1A1 Abrams tank in the Kursk region, but the crew was able to survive. The vehicle’s commander lauded the American armor for saving their lives, but also highlighted some major vulnerabilities it has on today's drone-drenched battlefield. In particular he offered important insights on how Ukraine is adapting its M1s to survive — lessons that could prove very valuable for the U.S. Army in future conflicts. The drone attack was 'the first time that the crew survived multiple hits while inside a disabled Abrams,' the tank commander told Rob Lee (@RALee85), a senior fellow with the Foreign Policy Research Institute, and Michael Kofman (@KofmanMichael), a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment. 'Actually, there were 4-6 direct hits. The crew survived, and even without injuries. God bless America.' A video of that attack, by an FPV drone with a fiber optic cable, was posted on Russian telegram channels. It showed the Abrams rumbling down a snow-dusted roadway and then cut to it being struck by an FPV drone, which disabled the tank. The video then shows another FPV drone strike on the left side side just below the turret. All the strikes came within about two minutes, the commander, who is with the 47th Separate Mechanized Brigade, told Lee and Kofman. Russian telegram channels posted videos of fiber optic cable FPV strikes on a Ukrainian Abrams tank in Kursk oblast last week. Aside from a concussion, the crew survived without injury and made it back to friendly lines. @KofmanMichael and I spoke to the commander of the tank… pic.twitter.com/piqapqvVMv&mdash; Rob Lee (@RALee85) December 19, 2024 The crew survived thanks to a combination of the Abrams’ design and modifications the Ukrainians made after learning battlefield lessons the hard way, the commander explained. Unlike Soviet-era tanks, Abrams was designed with the ammunition stored in the hull, not the turret, offering far greater protection for crews. 'Thanks to the fact that the ammo is completely separated from the crew, the crew has a chance to survive (unlike in the T series tanks),' the commander exclaimed. 'The Abrams is a great tank.' A seemingly endless stream of videos have appeared online showing Russian tanks experiencing what has been colloquially referred to as 'turret tosses' as the stored munitions inside its hull explode, sending the turrets flying into the air. You can see an example of that in the following video. One of the most epic turret tosses by a Russian tank, presumably T-90M pic.twitter.com/kPeKZFzYNW&mdash; Special Kherson Cat (@bayraktar_1love) November 23, 2024 The tank also 'had a unique 'cope cage' (actually, 'cope netting') and a lot more ERA than an average Abrams,' the commander explained. 'At least one' of the drones 'got stuck in the net. Two more missed several minutes before. They apparently hit the engine. They were unable to penetrate either the turret or the hull elsewhere while we were inside.' 'Without the additional ERA and 'cope netting' on top of the turret, we would have been smashed and surely dead by now without any chance,' the commander extolled. While militaries around the globe have began integrating 'cope cages' and other anti-drone screens on their armor, the U.S. has not followed suit, at least yet. This tank, which belonged to the Ukrainian 47th Separate Mechanized Brigade, survived FPV drones strikes in large measure because of the netting added to the turret. (Twitter screencap) Twitter screencap The commander offered several more takeaways about the Abrams. 'The most valuable advantage of the Abrams is that, when having much additional armor and a thorough approach, it saves human lives, even in dire conditions,' he noted. 'If the U.S. provided the tanks with the original armor and the complete [M-19 Abrams Reactive Armor Tiles (ARAT)] kits, this would make us more protected (although the top would still remain unprotected and we would need Kontakt-1, etc.),' he posited, adding some advice for the Pentagon. 'The American tankers should act promptly,' he urged. 'Their tanks are too thin and vulnerable given the current threats on the battlefield. Protect your tanks urgently to avoid losses in potential near-future conflicts, taking into account our experience.' A Russian drone operator prepares an FPV drone with a munition for launching. (Twitter screencap) The commander also dismissed concerns that the Abrams would be too heavy, even more so with two to three tons of additional weight from the added ERA tiles. In addition, he confirmed that Ukraine did not receive the latest version of the Abrams and they were sent the export version without depleted uranium armor. Before receiving their tanks, the 47th spent time training how to use them in Germany. The commander said while they were able to fire off a lot of rounds, the U.S. troops conducting that training did not have a full understanding of the challenges Ukraine would face fighting Russia. 'Well, we got a luxurious shooting practice (around 100 rounds fired by each gunner) and some good overall knowledge about the tank,' he explained. 'But the American instructors AND military were completely unaware of the modern battlefield threats. And still are unaware (I communicate with some of the American tankers and try to share information with them).' For example, the commander said his trainers 'are shocked that Russians can see us at night with thermal-vision recon drones (we were taught that we would be haunting the Russians who are blind at night), they do not understand at all the threat posed by the FPVs, etc.' You can see a Ukrainian journalist's report on that training in the video below.

They were first seen in combat in February and the first images of one that was destroyed appeared online three days later. In August, Australia promised to send 49 Abrams tanks to Ukraine. Ukraine has lost at least 17 Abrams, according to the Oryx open-source tracking group. Of those, at least eight were destroyed, one damaged, seven damaged and abandoned and one captured. The actual figures are likely higher in reality because Oryx only tabulates losses for which it has visual confirmation.

'Because of recent advances, Russian forces may capture it.' The commander and his crew made it back to friendly lines on foot. 'It was close to the Russian positions,' he noted. 'We could not evacuate because the FPVs were coming one after another. When I finally could hear no sound, we just jumped out of the tank and ran to a treeline. They were tracking us, so a mortar started working with some more drones, but we crawled away through the treeline. In the end, in a spot still under FPV control, our company commander rushed in and took us away.' Despite its flaws, imperfect training and combat under conditions never imagined, the Abrams tank is a hit with its crews. 'We&#8230;are in love with this tank and are immensely grateful to the United States,' the commander said.

Russia’s Belbek Air Base In Crimea Is Getting Hardened Aircraft S...	Recent satellite imagery of Belbek Air Base, near Sevastopol in Russian-occupied Crimea, shows new hardened aircraft shelters and additional construction to help shield aircraft from drone attacks and other indirect fire. This reflects a broader push by the Russian military to improve physical defenses at multiple airfields two and a half years after the launch of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The War Zone obtained the satellite image of Belbek, seen below, which was taken on December 19, from Planet Labs. Roughly ten hardened shelters can be seen in various stages of construction over existing aircraft parking spots at the central portion of the facility.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Additional physical defenses at Belbek make good sense. The base has been a notably high-priority target for Ukraine since the aircraft and air defenses based there help provide critical screening for the nearby Russian naval base at Sevastopol and also extend this coverage far out into the Black Sea. In addition to drone attacks, Ukrainian forces have employed U.S.-suppled Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) short-range ballistic missiles with cluster munition warheads against the facility. The base suffered a notably destructive ATACMS barrage in May of this year. Belbek is not the only Russian base that faces Ukrainian threats and there have been growing signs of Russian efforts particularly to shield highly vulnerable aircraft currently parked out on open flight lines from attack. Around September of this year, the first evidence began to appear in Russia of efforts to protect Flanker-series combat aircraft, which had previously been left exposed on their bases. While protective structures do exist on certain Russian air bases, the large dimensions of the Flanker mean that these aircraft were never provided with suitable hardened aircraft shelters. The only exceptions were in Poland and the former East Germany, and in some of the European Soviet republics — but not in Russia. In the second half of November, various satellite images published on social media documented the construction of hardening of hardened aircraft shelters at several Russian military airfields. These include Kursk, Akhtubinsk, Primorsko-Akhtarsk, Yeysk, Morozovsk, Millerovo, and Krymsk — now joined by Belbek. It appears that the construction of at least 70 ‘Flanker bunkers’ began at almost the same time. It quickly became clear that a concerted construction program was underway, the scope of which finds parallels with the rapid efforts to harden airfields across Eastern and Western Europe after the dramatic success of the Israeli Air Force in the 1967 Six-Day War. A Ukrainian research project, Frontelligence Insight, provided what may have been the first definitive publicly available evidence of new Russian bunker construction, in the form of a satellite photo taken at Kursk-Khalino Air Base on October 22. Here, for example, excavation work for the foundations, the provision of prefabricated concrete parts, and initial assembly work were all clearly visible.

Not only were critical airfields not equipped with protective structures, but there were no such hardened aircraft shelters suitable for the Flanker series in Russia. A satellite image taken in June of this year after a drone attack on Akhtubinsk Air Base shows damage to one and possibly two Su-57 new-generation fighters parked out in the open. Satellite image ©2024 Maxar Technologies While bombers operated by Russia's Long-Range Aviation branch were moved to — supposedly — safer bases deeper within Russia, tactical Su-24, Su-25, Su-30SM/M2, Su-34, and Su-35S aircraft remained primarily at their operational bases. However, they relocated every few months to other airfields within the operational area and sometimes even further away from the front line. Anti-aircraft defenses were set up at the edge of airfields, discarded aircraft were arranged as decoys and temporary blast walls were erected to protect against shrapnel and other fragments. More unorthodox measures included placing car tires on the upper surfaces of aircraft and painting aircraft silhouettes on concrete airfield surfaces. The tires, specifically, were intended to confuse image-matching seekers on Ukrainian missiles like the British-supplied Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missiles and nearly identical SCALP-EGs from France.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION On the whole, this mix of countermeasures to Ukrainian long-range strikes was largely ineffective. After all, it didn’t include adequate hardened aircraft shelters — admittedly, the most expensive solution, but also the best. With each successful Ukrainian airstrike, the stunned comments and unsparing assessments from the Russian military information space became harder to ignore. During an interview in July of this year, the Russian Minister of Defense Andrey Belousov provided assurance that 'a schedule for airfields has already been drawn up and shelters will definitely be built.' This report was picked up by Ukrainian analysts, who quickly assessed that such a project would be extremely expensive — roughly $1 billion for 300 AU-19 hardened aircraft shelters of the kind that can accommodate Flankers. The AU-19 is a standardized Soviet shelter pattern developed around the Flanker during the Cold War, but, as noted, wasn’t ever built inside Russia. The Ukrainian analysts concluded that Russia was unlikely to make this investment and would instead build shelters made of sheet steel at best, which would provide little more than weather protection. This statement was true to the extent that a dozen such shelters were built in the winter of 2023-24 at Marinovka Air Base, located close together in a straight line, alongside the reserve taxiway. By July 2024, the second construction phase at Marinovka had begun, resulting in another dozen shelters, but this time in a more dispersed form. A successful Ukrainian attack on Marinovka meant this construction work was never completed. In fact, the raid on Marinovka was probably a major factor behind the decision to build true hardened aircraft shelters, with work starting only a few weeks later. A metal hangar at Marinovka Air Base in Russia shows extensive shrapnel damage after a Ukrainian drone strike. via Telegram Another factor was almost certainly the expectation that the Biden administration would allow Ukraine to use U.S.-produced and donated ATACMS to hit targets deep inside Russia. These missiles can hit targets of up to about 190 miles away and their use in this capacity was approved on November 17. Roughly a week later, Ukraine used ATACMS in an attack on Kursk-Khalino Air Base, about 60 miles from the Ukrainian border. The need to provide adequate protection to aircraft — especially for the U.S. military — is something that The War Zone has addressed before. Aircraft shelters with varying degrees of hardening now very much back on the agenda globally, in response to evolving drone and missile threats. There is a growing debate within America's armed forces and Congress about the value of building new defensive infrastructure for its aircraft, as well as investments in new active air and missile defense and tactics, techniques, and procures. With the exception of a few forward deployment locations, the United States does not invest in robust shelters for its combat aircraft. The Russian experience from the war in Ukraine suggests that could be a mistake. At this point, it’s worth returning to the aforementioned AU-19 hardened aircraft shelter. The AU-19 design reflected the Soviet expectation that an air war with NATO would be fought over the Central Front, with tactical aviation moving rapidly forward to keep pace with armored thrusts, with aircraft operating from bases closer to the front lines, as well as from captured airfields and improvised airstrips. A Su-27 prepares to depart an air base in Poland, where it was stationed at the end of the Cold War, to go back to Russia, in July 1992. Soviet-operated air bases in Poland were among those to feature hardened aircraft shelters for Flanker-series fighters — seen here in the background. Rob Schleiffert/Wikimedia Commons There are actually two AU-19 subdesigns. According to the Soviet designation scheme, AU-19/1 is a shelter with classic three-walled external sliding gates, while AU-19/2 has internal hinged gates, analogous to those used in certain first-generation NATO hardened aircraft shelters. However, the new Flanker bunkers now appearing in Russia use a different design principle. For the sake of convenience, we can refer to them as AU-19/3. There are only a few images currently available showing the excavation pits for the foundations of the new shelters, their outer structures, building materials, and assembly processes. However, none of these suggest the AU-19/3 is in any way equivalent to the original AU-19. The degree of protection probably lies somewhere between a classic hardened aircraft shelter and the kind of sheet-metal shelters seen at Marinovka. A closer look at sheet-metal type of aircraft shelters at Marinovka, before the successful Ukrainian drone attack. Google Earth Stefan Büttner, an expert in Russian airbase infrastructure, told The War Zone that an AU-19/3 might just be able to withstand a hit from a drone armed with a 220-pound FAB-100 bomb, 'but anything more than that would inevitably lead to the collapse of the bunker itself in the event of a direct hit.' 'Based on the information currently available, the arched trusses used — presumably consisting of steel profile frames with concrete elements on top and a possible earth covering — give an impression of a construction that is far too fragile.' This leads to the question of why Russia didn’t simply ‘reissue’ the comparatively robust AU-19 dating from the 1980s. The design plans for the AU-19 are easily accessible and Russia has dozens of precast concrete factories whose product ranges reveal their Soviet origins. Perhaps, after all, it was simply a matter of cost that led to the current solution. Still, the ability to protect from lighter strikes, like those delivered by drones and cluster munitions, is extremely relevant and balancing cost versus the most widespread threats does make some sense.

F-35B And F-35C Use Different 25mm Gun Pods Unique To Each Varian...	It's no secret that the B and C variants of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter lack an internal 25mm cannon like the A version. Instead, they rely on belly-mounted pods to provide gun capability. What's perhaps less well known is that the gun pods for the F-35B and the F-35C are not identical and are not interchangeable due to the substantial structural differences between those aircraft. The fact of the existence of F-35B and F-35C-specific gun pods – designated GPU-9/A and GPU-8/A, respectively – is highlighted in a recent U.S. military contracting notice about plans to purchase more of both types from General Dynamics. Both pod types contain a single four-barrelled 25mm Gatling-type GAU-22/A cannon and 220 rounds of ammunition. Some sources have previously described the GPU-8/A as a 30mm gun pod developed for the F-16-series, but this appears to be a case of confusion with the GPU-5/A pod and its GAU-13/A derivative of the famed GAU-8/A Avenger cannon found on the A-10 Warthog. A US Marine Corps F-35C armed with a gun pod prepares to launch from the USS Abraham Lincoln during the RIMPAC 2022 exercise. USN A heavily redacted declassified copy of a report on the Joint Strike Fighter program that the Project on Government Oversight (POGO), an independent nonprofit, obtained and published back in November, further confirms that there are two pods and that they are not interchangeable. The Pentagon's Office of the Director of Test and Evaluation produced the report, which is dated February 2024. 'A podded version of the GAU-22/A is available for the F-35B and F-35C, which is externally carried on the centerline station of these aircraft,' an unredacted portion of the report. 'Differences in the outer mold-line fairing mount make the gun pods unique to each variant (i.e. an F-35B gun pod cannot be mounted on an F-35C aircraft).' As already noted, the GPU-8/A and the GPU-9/A do both contain the same gun and the same amount of ammunition. From available pictures, outwardly the two pods look virtually the same, but beyond that, what the total level of commonality between them might be is unclear. The War Zone has reached out to the F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO) for more details. A nearly 20-year-old General Dynamics briefing slide showing a single design of a podded 'gun system' for the short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) version and carrier variant (CV) of the F-35 (or F-35B and F-35C, respectively). General Dynamics Another General Dynamics briefing slide on the GAU-22/A cannon, shown here in the context of its internal mounting on the F-35A. General Dynamics The podded guns do appear to have largely escaped the serious problems the internally-mounted GAU-22/A has faced over the years. Issues linked to the helmet-mounted displays (HMD) that pilots use when flying all F-35 variants had impacted gun effectiveness across the board in the past, but are said to have been resolved. You can read more about F-35A's gun-related woes here. A U.S. Marine Corps F-35B was damaged in 2021 after a 25mm shell exploded shortly after leaving the muzzle of its podded gun, but the exact circumstances behind that mishap are unclear. That same year, another Marine F-35B, operating from the Royal Navy's carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth at the time, reportedly landed at Kadena Air Base in Japan due to unspecified issues with its gun pod. If nothing else, the fact that there are two gun pods for the F-35 series highlights the significant differences between the B and C variants, as well as the A model. There is only approximately 20 percent parts commonality between the three versions of the Joint Strike Fighter despite their external looks and shared development. The short takeoff and vertical landing capable F-35B is particularly unique with its integrated lift fan, articulating exhaust nozzle, and substantially lightened core structure, as well as its smaller internal weapons bays than either the A or C. The B's design also necessitates the inclusion of an automatic ejection system that you can read more about here. The variant-specific gun pods also underscore the maintenance, logistics, and sustainment issues caused by the very limited commonality between F-35 variants. The lack of interchangeability means that units flying F-35B and Cs notably cannot leverage a common pool, at least when it comes to complete pods. The War Zone has previously explored in great detail extremely worrisome spare parts and related supply chain issues facing the F-35, exacerbated by differences in the three versions, which could have serious operational impacts, especially during a sustained high-end fight in a vast battlespace. The often convoluted nature of the logistics ecosystem around the Joint Strike Fighter has created hurdles even for exercises and other routine peacetime deployments. The U.S. military is well aware of these issues, but has long struggled in addressing them. In the meantime, the Pentagon will have to contend with the realities that the differences between the F-35 variants impose, including the fact that they all have unique gun systems.

Russia Pummels Kyiv In Retaliation For ATACMS, Storm Shadow Strik...	Russia carried out another deadly wave of missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian cities which it claims was in retaliation for the use of Western-donated long-range weapons on its territory. There was at least one death and several injuries in Kyiv, deaths in Kherson, injuries and damage in Kryvyi Rih and tens of thousands left without power on a frigid winter night. 'Today at around 7 a.m., the Russian armed forces launched a combined missile strike on Kyiv,' regional military administrator Serhiy Popko said on Telegram. 'The enemy probably used ballistic missiles. As a result of this strike, debris was recorded falling in three districts of the city.

'The air attack was repelled by aviation, anti-aircraft missile troops, electronic warfare units, and mobile fire groups of the Air Force and the Defense Forces of Ukraine,' the Air Force claimed, adding that '40 Shahed attack UAVs and other types of drones have been shot down in Kursk, Poltava, Sumy, Kyiv, Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhia regions.' 'As a result of the nighttime missile and drone strike, private and apartment buildings, medical facilities, warehouses, and farms in the Dnipropetrovsk, Sumy, Kyiv, and Kharkiv regions were hit,' the Air Force proffered.

The missile strike at the Kombinat Kamensky enterprise in Rostov region was carried out by six ATACMS and four Storm Shadows, the MoD stated. 'This morning, in response to the actions of the Kyiv regime supported by Western countries, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation delivered a group strike by long-range precision weaponry at a command post of the Security Service of Ukraine, the Luch Design Bureau, which develops and manufactures Neptune missile systems and Olkha MLRS ground-based cruise missiles, as well as hit positions of a Patriot SAM system,' the MoD claimed on Telegram. The War Zone cannot independently confirm those claims. The Kombinat Kamensky plant produces rocket fuels used in various weapons ranging from the Kornet anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) to the Iskander-M ballistic missile, according to the Ukrainian Militarnyi news outlet. Though Russia routinely carries out missile attacks across Ukraine, the Russian MoD vowed revenge strikes on the Kombinat Kamensky plant right after the attack. 'These actions of the Kyiv regime, supported by Western curators, will not remain unanswered,' the Russian MoD stressed at the time. The threat of retaliation by Russia was one of the reasons given by the Biden administration for its reluctance to allow Ukraine to use ATACMS inside Russia, a nuclear power. However, after a long debate, it finally gave the green light for such attacks on Nov. 17, which you can read more about here. The policy change was spurred by the presence of North Korean troops fighting in Kursk, U.S. officials said. The U.K. approved the use of Storm Shadows in Russia back in May. This all comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened to use his new Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile on Kyiv to conduct a technology duel with Western-donated air defense systems. You can read much more about that later in this story. The Latest On the battlefield, while fighting continued to rage in Russia’s Kursk region and across the east of Ukraine, little territory was gained or lost. Moscow’s forces, however, are getting closer to Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region. Here are the key takeaways from the latest Institute for the Study of War assessment.

Russia is nearing victory, said Putin, for a variety of reasons. '&#8230;the advance is not by 100, 200, or 300 meters. Our fighting men are regaining the territory by square kilometers. I want to stress – every day! Why is this happening?' 'First, last year, and this basically is the classical course of hostilities, the enemy attacks, sustains a heavy defeat, loses a lot of equipment, ammunition and personnel, and then the other side starts to push forward. In our case, this is happening exactly in this way. Combat operations are a difficult thing. So, it is hard – and makes no sense – to think far too ahead. But it happens precisely in this way. And we are advancing, as we said, towards achieving the priority goals that we outlined at the start of the special military operation.' Putin receiving the banner of the 155th Marine Brigade of the Pacific Fleet. (Kremlin) While Putin has previously stated that the Kursk region would be fully liberated following Ukraine's August invasion, he declined to say exactly when that will happen. 'I cannot and do not want to provide a specific date as to when they will be driven out,' he explained. 'Our troops are engaged in combat right now, and the battles are intense. As I have mentioned before, there was no strategic military reason for the Ukrainian armed forces to enter the Kursk Region or to hold their position there as they are, deploying their elite assault groups and units to no avail. Yet, this situation persists. We will undoubtedly drive them out.' He added that he is ready to meet with Trump. 'You asked what we can offer, or what I can offer to the newly elected President Trump when we meet,' Putin said in response to a question from NBC’s Keir Simmons. 'First of all, I don’t know when we will meet. Because he hasn’t said anything about it. I haven’t spoken to him at all in over four years. Of course, I am ready for this at any time, and I will be ready for a meeting if he wants it.' Asked what he would do differently about launching the war, Putin said: 'Knowing what's happening now, back in 2022 I would've thought the decision ought to have been taken earlier. We ought to have started getting ready for those developments, and the special military operation, before.' I should have invaded Ukraine earlier, Putin tells Russians in TV marathon Mike Walker (@New_Narrative) December 19, 2024 He also threatened to hit Kyiv with the new Oreshnik Intermediate-Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM) as a way to test the Western-provided air defense systems. 'There are several types of air defense systems&#8230;such as Patriot and the more modern [Terminal High Altitude Area Defense] THAAD systems,' Putin said, the latter of which has not been sent to Ukraine. 'I do not know if Ukraine has them, but I do not think so. If the Americans want, they can send its THAAD systems to Ukraine. These are more modern systems similar to our S-400 systems. The Patriot systems are comparable to our S-300s, while THAAD is similar to our S-400 systems, if only slightly inferior. Let them send these systems to Ukraine, and we will ask our people in Ukraine to tell us about the modern solutions of these systems which we could use.' That comparative of missile systems is wildly inaccurate by any standards. As for the name of the missile, Putin smirked, claiming he did not know its origin. 'Honestly, no idea,' he said. 'No clue.' Last month, Russia struck the city of Dnipro with the Oreshnik, most likely a conventionally armed IRBM based on the RS-26 Rubezh. You can read more about the history of this weapon in our deep dive here.

The barrier, as we previously reported, was made up of nearly three dozen barges sunk just south of the twice-attacked bridge. The extent of the storm damage, however, is unclear. There were 34 barges there as of Oct. 1. Naval expert HI Sutton posted on Twitter Thursday that of those, only 11 remain. He suggested that the other 23 possibly sank in the storm. However, on Dec. 10, the Kyiv Independent noted that there were far fewer barges there before Sunday's storm. 'Recent Sentinel-2 satellite images from Dec. 8 reveal only 18 barges remaining between Tuzla Island and the Kerch Peninsula,' the publication reported. 'The fate of the other 16 vessels is unclear.' The barriers were designed to stop Ukrainian uncrewed surface vessels (USV) from striking the bridge. It was severely damaged in July 2023 by a Ukrainian Sea Baby drone boat attack and before that by a truck bomb in October 2022. While the status of the bridge barrier is uncertain, the oil leaking out of the ships sunk in the storm created a huge environmental disaster. ***UPDATE***Remains of #Russian tankers and damage to defences at Kerch Bridge, December 18, 2024 #OSINT pic.twitter.com/kHXPt4Y0UF&mdash; H I Sutton (@CovertShores) December 18, 2024 It looks like more North Korean 170mm M1989 Koksan self-propelled artillery units are heading to the front lines.

Spanish Typhoon Buy Signals Upward Trend For Eurofighter	Spain is buying another 25 Eurofighter Typhoons, to replace some of its oldest EF-18 Hornet fighters, as part of a continuing modernization program for the Spanish Air and Space Force. The announcement of the deal comes amid something of an upturn in fortunes for the pan-European multirole fighter, which is also receiving new radars and weapons. An artist’s impression of a Spanish Typhoon from the latest Halcón II program. Airbus Juanjo Sanz Known as the Halcón II (Hawk II) program, the latest Spanish contract, which covers 21 single-seat and four twin-seat Typhoons, was announced today. The agreement was signed between the Spanish government and the NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency (NETMA), based in Germany. Deliveries are due to start in 2030. The Spanish government has ordered 25 additional #Eurofighter!

These jets will start to be delivered in 2026.

Initially, Spain signed up for 73 Typhoons, although three have been lost through attrition, leaving a current fleet of 70 aircraft from Tranche 1, 2, and 3A production. Like the earlier jets, the Halcón I and II Typhoons will be built locally at the Airbus plant in Getafe, near Madrid. Typhoons delivered under Halcón I and II will be considerably more capable than the Tranche 1, 2, and 3A aircraft already in service.

Airbus The new Tranche 4 standard features advanced avionics, including an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar. For the Spanish aircraft, this radar is the Captor-E Mk 1, which you can read more about here. A model of the ECRS Mk 1 radar from Hensoldt. Photo by Marijan Murat/picture alliance via Getty Images Tranche 4 also has enhanced weapon systems allowing it to use the Brimstone 3 precision air-to-ground munition and full capability with the Meteor beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile. Today, the Spanish Air and Space Force — or Ejército del Aire y del Espacio — fields Typhoons at the air bases of Morón (11th Wing), near Seville, and Los Llanos (14th Wing), in Albacete. An official video showing Typhoons from Morón (11th Wing) and Los Llanos (14th Wing): Next, the service will introduce Typhoons at Gando (46th Wing), in the Canary Islands, as it starts the process of replacing its oldest EF-18 ‘legacy’ Hornets. The Canary Islands are a Spanish archipelago located in the Atlantic Ocean, west of Morocco. These oldest Hornets were previously operated by the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps as F/A-18As. A total of 24 were sourced from U.S. stocks between 1995 and 2000 and were modernized to the F/A-18A+ standard, making them broadly comparable with the U.S. Navy’s F/A-18C/D. However, the airframes are now old and, although they have a multirole capability, they have always been primarily used for air defense. While the Halcón I Typhoons will succeed the old EF-18s in the Canary Islands, Halcón II will kickstart the replacement of the remaining Spanish Hornets. Spanish Typhoons prepare to depart Los Llanos, Albacete, on November 28, 2024, for Romania, where they will remain deployed until March. The fighters were already in April this year performing defense and deterrence tasks on the eastern flank of the Atlantic alliance. Photo By Victor Fernandez/Europa Press via Getty Images Europa Press News These were delivered new, from the aircraft’s original manufacturer, McDonnell Douglas, between 1986 and 1992. A total of 72 were received, but the fleet has since been reduced to 52 single-seaters and 12 two-seaters. Spain’s new-build Hornets were put through an upgrade program in the mid-1990s, which brought them up to a standard that was broadly similar to the F/A-18C/D. The resulting aircraft, which became known as EF-18A+/B+s, featured new mission computers, targeting pods, and AIM-120 AMRAAM capability. A continued process of enhancements under a mid-life upgrade effort has since helped the Hornets keep pace with their rivals, adding the Thales Scorpion helmet-mounted display and a ROVER air-to-ground video datalink for the targeting pod, among others. In the process, the jets received the revised designations EF-18AM/BM. One of the former U.S.-operated F/A-18A+ jets on a mission over the Canary Islands. Giovanni Colla/Ejército del Aire Ministerio de Defensa España While not as worn-out as the ex-U.S. EF-18s serving in the Canary Islands, these aircraft are also now showing their age. It’s notable, meanwhile, that the equivalent F/A-18C/D has now been retired from frontline U.S. Navy service. Back in 2020, The War Zone suggested that Spain might well buy more Typhoons (today’s Halcón II announcement), but a question remains about its plans for the rest of the EF-18 fleet, which will also require replacement before too long. As an alternative to more Typhoons, Spain might choose to risk waiting on the new pan-European combat jet being developed under the Future Combat Air System (FCAS), which also involves France, Germany, and Belgium. The FCAS initiative plans to field a sixth-generation stealthy crewed fighter and accompanying uncrewed platforms, weapons, and sensors by 2040. An artist’s impression of the Next Generation Fighter (NGF) that will be at the core of the pan-European FCAS program. Dassault Aviation Dassault Aviation Whether the FCAS program meets this timeline is questionable, however, and this might lead to more Spanish orders for Typhoons. Having bought batches of 20 and 25 Tranche 4 Typhoons, another batch of 20-25 aircraft might be an option, depending on FCAS progress. At the same time, there is a Spanish Navy requirement to replace its EAV-8B+ Matador II short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) jets — equivalent to the U.S. Marine Corps AV-8B+ Harrier II — which operate from the deck of the amphibious assault ship Juan Carlos I. Here, the only crewed fighter option is the F-35B Joint Strike Fighter.

Photo by Jon Hobley/MI News/NurPhoto via Getty Images MI News With a force of only 13 Matador IIs to replace from around 2030 to 2034, buying F-35Bs for just this requirement will likely prove cost-prohibitive. However, there may be an argument to buy a larger force of F-35Bs to operate from the Juan Carlos I and from land bases, paralleling the arrangement adopted by the United Kingdom. Whatever happens with replacing the Matador II and the remaining EF-18s, today’s announcement only reinforces Spain’s commitment to the Typhoon. In contrast to other operators, most of which are planning to withdraw their oldest Tranche 1 Typhoons, Spain decided to upgrade its 17 surviving Tranche 1 jets. Airbus has incorporated later Tranche 2 and Tranche 3 equipment in these aircraft, to provide a full multirole capability. Re-deliveries of the modernized Typhoons began in 2019. Outside of Spain, Eurofighter has secured follow-on orders from other core customers. Germany is buying 38 Tranche 4 aircraft and another 20 Tranche 4+/5 jets, 15 of which will be configured for electronic warfare missions. Italy is also adding to its fleet, with an order for 24 Tranche 4 aircraft.

The Captor-E Mk 2 radar, also known as ECRS Mk 2 radar, has now been fitted in a British Typhoon. This is an even more advanced radar than the ECRS Mk 1 that Spain will receive and includes a unique ‘swashplate’ positioning mechanism to further boost its capabilities. A recent photo published by the Hensoldt company in Germany — part of the ECRS consortium — indicates that inflight tests of the ECRS Mk 1 are also due to start soon. In this case, rather than mounting the radar in a Typhoon, it has been installed in an Airbus A320 flying testbed, within a radome grafted onto the front of the airliner. A German Aerospace Center (DLR) A320 testbed fitted with a radome housing the ECRS Mk 1 radar. Hensoldt In other Typhoon news from today, Germany has decided to complete the work to integrate the Taurus KEPD 350 cruise missile on the aircraft. Germany originally acquired this weapon to arm its Tornado IDS swing-wing strike aircraft and, although trials have been carried out with the Typhoon, it was not fully integrated. Now, the Taurus KEPD 350 will be introduced on operational German Typhoons, as part of the P4E upgrade package. That should see the German Air Force deploying the cruise missile on its Typhoons from 2028 or 2029. As a Taurus KEPD 350 operator, Spain might also choose to integrate the missile on its Typhoons, too.

Marine-Moving Medium Landing Ship Critical To China Fight Put On ...	The U.S. Navy’s Medium Landing Ship (LSM), a platform many view as crucial to transporting Marines among remote islands in a future war against China, is dead in the water for the time being. Reports emerged this week that sea service leaders balked at high cost estimates that have come in from industry to build the vessel. The pause raises questions about how the U.S. Marine Corps will enact its West Pacific, island-hopping concepts of operations, known as Expeditionary Advance Base Operations (EABO), and is the latest delay to afflict the program. Formerly known as the Light Amphibious Warship (LAW) and also referred to as the Landing Ship Medium, the vessel is envisioned as delivering forces right onto a beach without any established port facilities. It would ferry mobile, platoon-size Marine units to islands where they would fire anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCM) at Chinese forces and collect data for the other U.S. forces, among other tasks. Those Marines would also work to deter opponents in situations short of actual conflict, while helping to control littoral areas and seascapes. Such missions would be conducted by the new Marine Littoral Regiments (MLR). They would occur within China’s striking distance, likely in the southern Japanese islands and in the Philippines, part of a sea-denial campaign spanning the South China Sea and East China Sea, analysts say. Navy and Marine Corps leaders have called for between 18 to 35 LSMs that would range in length from 200 to 400 feet, with a 12-foot draft, each crewed by about 70 sailors, according to an August Congressional Research Service (CRS) report. The LSM would provide 8,000 square feet of deck cargo space, carrying 50 Marines and nearly 650 tons of equipment. A rendering of the future U.S. Navy Medium Landing Ship (LSM) and its capabilities. (U.S. Navy) LSM would also feature a helicopter landing pad, two 30mm guns and six .50-caliber machine guns for self defense. They would have a 14-knot transit speed, a cruising range of 3,500 nautical miles, and would be expected to serve for 20 years. But as the Marine Corps continues to urgently relay their need for the LSM, the Navy canceled a request for proposals to build the LSM after bids from industry came in too high, according to the sea service and media reports. Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) officials declined to tell TWZ the cost estimate that led the service to cancel its solicitation for the LSM on Dec. 6, saying it was unable to provide 'source selection sensitive information.' The LSM program is now working to revise its acquisition strategy to 'address affordability concerns,' the command said. 'A Request for Information (RFI) is likely to be released to industry very early in 2025 to identify non-developmental options,' NAVSEA added. USNI News’ Mallory Shelbourne first reported the latest LSM setback this week, citing comments by Navy leadership. 'We put it out for bid and it came back with a much higher price tag,' USNI News quoted Assistant Secretary of the Navy for research, development and acquisition Nickolas Guertin as saying at an American Society of Naval Engineers symposium last week. 'We simply weren’t able to pull it off. So we had to pull that solicitation back and drop back and punt.' Guertin noted that the service had what they thought was a 'bulletproof' cost estimate, and a 'pretty well wrung out design in terms of requirements, independent cost estimates,' USNI News reported. The Navy’s proposed Fiscal Year 2025 budget requests shows the first LSM would cost $268 million, but costs would average out to roughly $156 million by the seventh and eighth ship, according to the Congressional Research Service (CRS). A U.S. defense official speaking on condition of anonymity told TWZ Thursday that initial plans called for each ship to cost between $100 million and $150 million, but that the Navy added features to meet their requirements, and that shot the price of each ship up dramatically. The Marines wanted a ship that was less exquisite and more numerous, according to the official. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) said in April that Navy estimates for the LSM’s cost have 'varied widely.' CBO’s own analysis found the LSM could cost $340 million to $430 million per ship for an 18-ship program, an estimate it said reflects the range of full-load displacements – 4,500 tons to 5,400 tons – in preliminary designs that shipbuilders submitted to the Navy. Marine Corps representatives told TWZ Thursday that the service is currently working on 'a way ahead' for the LSM program in conjunction with the Navy, and is exploring other options that will allow the MLRs to continue advancing the EABO concept. LSMs are seen as a key mover of Marines under EABO, which is a major component of the Marine Corps overhaul known as Force Design 2030 that seeks to ready the service for a war with China. Part of that original vision saw the Navy and Marines moving away from a laser focus on large amphibious assault and landing ships. A more nimble, numerous and cost-effective fleet of small ships tailored to distributed warfare in the Pacific would offset some of the reduced large amphibious warship force. That so far has not happened, and the 'Gator Navy' fleet focused on massive beach landings, which many say are unrealistic in modern warfare, remains intact. A rendering of a potential medium landing ship by the shipmaker Austal. (Austal) TWZ has extensively reported on EABO and what it means for the Corps:. 'At its core, EABO involves relatively small groups of Marines quickly establishing bases of operation in forward areas, especially on small islands. This concept of distributed operations also envisions them being able to then rapidly reposition themselves, as necessary. The purpose is to use these flexible, responsive ground forces to help control littoral areas, and even surrounding 'seaspaces,' to deter opponents in situations short of an actual conflict, and then, if that fails, be well-positioned to engage enemy forces.' In a statement to TWZ Thursday, the Marine Corps reiterated that the LSM is a critical component of the island-hopping mission it expects the MLRs to one day embark upon under the EABO concept. 'The medium landing ship (LSM) is intended to provide surface maneuver direct support to Stand-in Forces (SIF) and the Marine Regiments executing missions on behalf of the naval campaign,' the service said. 'Put plainly, to move a Marine regiment around the Pacific or elsewhere, it would take many C-17s … to move the personnel and equipment that a medium landing ship can move. And that’s without the geographic flexibility of a beachable surface craft.' A Marine sets up defenses during an Expeditionary Advance Base Operation (EABO) exercise in 2020. (U.S. Marine Corps) The Marine Corps also told TWZ that it is working on 'an acquisition way ahead' for the LSM, and that the 'complex requirements' of the ship 'challenge government and industry to design and produce affordable materiel solutions.' For now, the Marines are making do and are leaning on existing commercial and military capabilities that require little modification, according to the service. Those efforts have included Marines using stern-landing ships to inform the development of the LSM in the interim. A June 2024 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report warned that 'existing commercial designs require significant modifications to meet LSM’s requirements,' and that none of the commercial designs assessed by the Navy had the required beachability or cargo fuel capacity. 'Although not optimal, such vessels will provide both operational capability and a sound basis for live experimentation and refining detailed requirements for the LSM program,' the Corps said in a 2022 update to Force Design 2030. The Marines first introduced the idea of the LSM in 2020, but the program has suffered several stalls, with plans to acquire the first vessels initially pushed back to Fiscal Year 2023 and then to Fiscal 2025, as the Navy grapples with hefty bills for submarines and other needs, Defense News reported in 2022. The Navy began receiving LSM concepts from shipyards and design firms in late 2020. By January 2024, the Navy was seeking proposals for the LSM, with Marine Corps officials saying they were on pace to procure in 2025 and deliver in 2029, according to the CRS. Opinions continue to differ on what the LSM should be, with the Navy wanting a survivable vessel and the Marines looking to field the capability as quickly as possible, as some warn that China could invade Taiwan and prompt a U.S. response in the next few years. Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Eric Smith downplayed concerns about the LSM’s survivability in 2023, according to a report by Defense Daily’s Rich Abbott. 'Well, if I take that to the next step, soldiers and Marines, y’all can’t leave the barracks because the enemy’s got machine guns,' Smith was quoted as saying. 'Hey, pilots, you got to stay on the tarmac because there’s anti-air missiles out there. Hey, submariners and ship drivers, y’all can’t leave the pier because there’s [anti-ship cruise missiles] and torpedoes. That doesn’t make sense.' The Commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. Eric M. Smith, right, and the Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. Lisa M. Franchetti. (U.S. Marine Corps) TWZ has reported on leaders playing down the differences between the services on where LSM should head. Despite 'healthy friction' over the LSM, 'there is no daylight between us' on the need for those ships, Navy Vice Adm. Scott Conn, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Warfighting Requirements and Capabilities, said at a conference in April 2023. The latest LSM travails again highlight a longstanding tension between the Navy and Marine Corps. The Marines need certain maritime capabilities for amphibious operations. The Navy is tasked with moving those Marines, but must pay for the ships the Marines need. Similar debates have surfaced around the size of the larger-deck amphibious fleet in recent years as well. The amphibious force is 'not the favorite thing of the Navy to deal with,' according to Bradley Martin, a retired Navy surface warfare officer who spent two-thirds of his 30-year career at sea. 'I say this as a guy who spent a number of years on the amphibs,' said Martin, now a senior policy researcher with the RAND think tank. 'The Marines aren’t very worried about how the Navy sustains ships, and the Navy hasn’t been really clear about what it takes to sustain ships. There’s been that disconnect.' Mark Cancian, a retired Marine Corps colonel and senior advisor with the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank’s defense and security department, told TWZ Thursday that the LSM conundrum is different because, unlike past amphibious disagreements, the Marines want a low-end ship and the Navy is arguing for a high-end capability. Cancian worked in the Pentagon in the 1990s and recalled a proposal for the equivalent to a LHA or LHD amphib built to civilian standards that could be used for peacetime presence missions. It would be cheaper but unsuitable for wartime needs. 'The Marine Corps fought against it tooth and nail,' he recalled. 'I remember Marines being in my office, saying it would be immoral to put Marines on a ship built to civilian standards.' The amphibious assault ship USS Wasp (LHD-1), a traditional big-deck Marine mover. (U.S. Navy) 'There’s going to be some tough negotiations between the Navy and Marine Corps,' Cancian added. 'And the new administration will weigh in too, on force design, on the topline and shipbuilding. But the Marine Corps won’t give up.' In general, the LSM’s concept has not matched its execution, Martin said. 'They need something, and this just isn’t the right capability,' he said. 'It’s too expensive. When you get right down to it, you’ve got to move stuff around, even if you beach, you’re still going to be vulnerable during the period that you’re beached.' The Pentagon should instead be investing in civilian-manned ferries for such missions that would be part of the existing strategic sealift fleet, Martin said. China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) is already at work on such a civilian-military meld. It has been modifying roll-on, roll-off (RO/RO) ferries with stern ramps that will allow the force to launch and recover amphibious combat vehicles in the event of a cross-strait invasion of Taiwan, Maritime Executive reported in 2023. Such a move would give the PLAN a big boost when it comes to the amount of amphibious lift it could summon for such a landing, allowing Beijing to close its amphibious gap without building more military amphibs. The Pentagon’s annual report on China’s military capabilities released this week notes that 'amphibious marine forces continued to conduct routine driver integration training with PLAN amphibious and civilian roll-on/roll-off (RO/RO) vessels.' 'Amphibious marine forces continued to conduct routine driver integration training with PLAN amphibious ships and civilian roll-on/roll-off (RO/RO) vessels,' the report states. 'Non-amphibious marine forces continued civilian-military integration training, with a new PLANMC BDE in the northern theater observed loading vehicles onto a RO/RO and conducting a sea crossing before unloading from the RO/RO.' China has also used civilian ferries to move its amphibious forces and launch amphibious craft during beach invasion drills. Turning commercial ships into helicopter carriers is also something China's is training to do during a major contingency operation.

LSMs won’t be used to storm a beach, or for opposed landings, Martin said. But the requirements include a military crew, damage control and other features that don’t reflect its core mission, which drives up the price. 'Anywhere that ship might go is subject to targeting, but having the type of weapons it’s got on it won’t do much good against the type of threat the Chinese or any capable power are likely to throw against it,' he said. 'It’s not a well-conceived answer.' Real talk about what capability the Navy could provide for the Marines to carry out EABO might have occurred at lower levels, but likely got diluted further up the chain, he said. 'It got further and further away from a discussion about requirements, toward just a head nod that we’re going to do it,' Martin said. 'That is a problem with the Navy’s management of requirements in general. All the services are guilty of this to a degree, but the people generating requirements are not talking to other people generating requirements, and they’re not engaged with the people actually designing equipment, and that’s a big problem.' Even as the Marines proceed with Force Design 2030 and EABO, CRS’s August 2024 LSM report notes that debate about the merits of the two plans continue. Questions remain about whether the concepts focus too heavily on China war scenarios at the expense of other Marine Corps missions. It also remains unclear whether the MLRs would be able to get access to the islands they need to operate from, in addition to resupply and survivability concerns. There’s also the question of whether the MLRs could contribute meaningfully to sea-denial operations, although the Marines emphasize that the MLR platoons would be collecting vital data as well. American military brass portrays the threat of war with China as one that is just over the horizon. If that is in fact the case, the latest delay in the LSM hinders the Marines’ ability to contribute to that fight in the not-so-distant future, given their plans for how their portion of that fight would play out. Above all else, it highlights a disconnect between urgent messaging on the threat and what's needed to address it, and the actual procurement of those solutions.

Syria’s Air Defenses Helped Make The F-22A Raptor A Reality	In the face of post-Cold War drawdowns, the U.S. Air Force pushed ahead with buying the famously expensive F-22 Raptor stealth fighter in part because of a perhaps unexpected reason: concerns about Syrian air defenses. Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall talked about the Syrian connection to the F-22's story during an online talk that the Air & Space Forces Association's Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies hosted earlier today. Kendall is an Army veteran and career civil servant who has held various positions within the Department of Defense and the Air Force since the 1980s, including ones in which he was directly involved in crafting requirements for what became the F-22. The Air Force selected Lockheed's YF-22 as the winner of its Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) competition, beating out Northrop's YF-23, in 1991 just as the Soviet Union was collapsing. The U.S. military spending notably contracted following the end of the Cold War, with various high-profile programs ending up canceled or severely truncated as a result. Questions were raised about the multi-billion-dollar F-22 acquisition program. Northrop's YF-23, at top, flies alongside Lockheed's YF-22. USAF 'The scenario that we used &#8230; on a requirements basis to convince ourselves, [and] Secretary [of Defense Dick] Cheney, that we should continue with the F-22 was Syria,' Kendall said today. 'Right after the Cold War, &#8230; they had [one of] the most modern &#8230; integrated air defenses at the time.' During the 1970s and 1980s, the Syrian military did amass a significant array of Soviet short, medium, and long-range surface-to-air missile systems. This included fixed site types like the SA-2 Guideline and SA-5 Gammon, self-propelled designs like the SA-6 Gainful and the SA-11 Gadfly, and multiple variants of the Strela family of man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS).

YURI KADOBNOV/AFP via Getty Images YURI KADOBNOV In the end, the F-22 program was still significantly scaled back ostensibly over its high cost and the Air Force only received 187 examples in the end, a decision widely viewed today as near-sighted. It's certainly interesting to consider that Syrian air defenses were once significant enough to drive the development of something like the F-22, which remains the most capable fighter in U.S. inventory today. Syria was actually the first locale where the Raptor was employed in combat, with the stealthy jets striking ISIS terrorists in the country in 2014. F-22s were utilized in part because of their survivability against potential threats from the regime in Damascus. F-22s continued to operate over the country for years afterward to help shield U.S. forces and their local partners from Syrian forces, as well as their Iranian and Russian allies. Kendall's comments about the Syrian scenario and the F-22 came in response to a question about future stand-in strike capabilities. 'It depends upon who you're standing against&#8230; Clearly, we need some of that capability [against] critical targets. It can be accomplished in different ways. You can do it with stand-off weapons, up to a point, but there's a cost associated with that,' Kendall explained, after which he shared the F-22/Syria anecdote. 'Our pacing challenge today is not Syria. It's much tougher,' he continued. 'You gotta take a harder look at what's the right mix and what do you want to do with it. The other thing that's true is that Syria was not a nuclear power. Russia and China are nuclear powers with a lot of nuclear weapons. So what you would do in a conventional conflict with them has to be done with an eye to what are the consequences in the strategic [realm].' The Air Force is currently in the process of acquiring a new dedicated Stand-in Attack Weapon (SiAW) missile to 'provide [a] capability to strike rapidly re-locatable targets that create the Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) environment,' according to the service's 2025 Fiscal Year budget request. Those 'targets include Theater Ballistic Missile Launchers, Land Attack and Anti-Ship Cruise Missile Launchers, Jammers, Anti-Satellite Systems, and Integrated Air Defense Systems.' A US Air Force F-16C Viper fighter releases a SiAW test missile. USAF Northrop Grumman is leading the development of the SiAW, which is a derivative of the company's AGM-88G Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile-Extended Range (AARGM-ER) missile. AARGM-ER, a program the U.S. Navy is leading, is intended primarily to punch holes in enemy air defenses, though it will also have a more general secondary strike capability. The stealthy F-35A Joint Strike Fighter is expected to be the first platform armed with the SiAW, which could find its way onto other aircraft and that you can read more about here. Kendall's comments today about capabilities mixes and cost considerations also come as the service's plans for a new sixth-generation stealth combat jet as part of its larger Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) modernization initiative are very much in question. A final decision on how to proceed with that program has now been pushed into next year when President-elect Donald Trump takes office. The fate of other Air Force advanced aviation efforts, including its Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drone program and plans to acquire stealthy aerial refueling tankers, are also intertwined with the NGAD combat jet decision. The current 'pacing challenge,' or 'China, China, China' as Kendall has liked to say during his tenure as Air Force Secretary, will be a key factor in any decision-making about Air Force modernization plans just like Syria apparently was for the F-22.

Iranian F-14 Tomcat Encounter At An Airshow Unlike Any Other	As the world’s only operator of the legendary F-14 Tomcat swing-wing fighter, the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force (IRIAF) has a unique airpower status. A recent airshow provided the chance for a very rare close-quarters look at the Cold War-era jet, which by now has very questionable capabilities and serviceability, while there are persistent reports that it could soon be replaced entirely by Russian-provided Su-35 Flanker multirole fighters. Živojin Banković, a military aviation writer for the Serbian Tango Six website, shared with The War Zone photos that he took while on assignment in Iran, where he saw one of the country’s last F-14s, as well as other unusual aircraft types, at the 2024 Kish Air Show. Star of the show: the participating F-14A serial number 3-6006 from the 8th Tactical Air Base at Isfahan. @tower_eye, Tango Six In fact, the 12th Iran International Aerospace Exhibition on Kish Island in the Persian Gulf, held from December 10-13, offered what might be the public’s final opportunity to witness the ‘Persian Cats’ in action. Even getting to the event was something of a challenge, especially given the tensions and complex geopolitical situation in the Middle East right now. For Banković, conditions were eased somewhat since his native Serbia is one of just five European nations whose citizens can enter Iran without visas, with Tehran allowing tourist stays of up to 15 days. @tower_eye, Tango Six The 2024 Kish Air Show presented some challenges for the organizers, too. On December 5, in the run-up to the show, an Iranian-made Yasin jet trainer crashed while flying to the event, killing its two pilots, Colonels Hamidreza Ranjbar and Manuchehr Pirzadeh. The highly experienced test pilots had been expected to demonstrate the Yasin and U.S.-made F-5 fighters at the show. While the cause of the crash has not been disclosed, there are unconfirmed reports that the aircraft may have suffered a double engine failure. The F-14 dominates the IRIAF static display at Kish Island. @tower_eye, Tango Six Understandably, the incident tempered the atmosphere at the airshow, resulting in a somewhat somber 12th edition. Initially, the organizers told Banković and his colleagues that there would be no military aircraft present at the airshow. Poised to cancel the trip to Iran entirely, another email arrived just a couple of days before the show was to begin — the IRIAF would participate after all. Still, on arrival, there would be more problems for Banković, as he explained to The War Zone: 'The first day presented challenges for spotters who had purchased spotter tickets costing hundreds of dollars. Poor organization and coordination between the event staff, police, and military security prevented access to the designated airport areas — as had been promised. As an apology, the organizers offered a morning tourist tour of Kish Island on the final day.' Despite these setbacks, journalists and enthusiasts subsequently enjoyed unprecedented access to the F-14 and its crew, relishing the chance to see the operational Tomcat on the ground and in the air — something impossible in the Western world since the U.S. Navy retired the fighter back in 2006. The F-14 might still be the pride of the IRIAF, but the fleet has suffered high-profile issues throughout its eventful service in Iran. The nose of the IRIAF F-14 contains an AN/AWG-9 fire control radar. @tower_eye, Tango Six In particular, the F-14’s once-state-of-the-art AN/AWG-9 fire control radar has suffered from low serviceability, with the Tomcat fleet effectively being divided between those with fully functioning radars and those with more diminished capabilities. The current status of any surviving AIM-54 Phoenix and AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missiles is also a matter of debate and Iranian programs to introduce alternative weaponry for the F-14 have had only very mixed results, as you can read more about here. The fact that only one F-14 was included in the airshow is almost certainly indicative of broader problems within the IRIAF. As well as long-term maintenance issues with the Tomcats especially, the air force as a whole is facing the prospect of a potential broader conflict in the region, so serviceable combat jets would have been required for quick reaction alert and other high-priority tasks. As it was, the IRIAF participated at Kish with a fleet of just 10 aircraft. The static display featured six aircraft (three F-5s and three PC-7 turboprop trainers), while four others participated in the aerial display (one F-14 and three F-4 Phantoms). This fell short of the originally announced lineup, which was supposed to include demonstrations of the Yasin, F-5, MiG-29 Fulcrum, and Yak-130 Mitten, along with additional aircraft in the static display. A Saghe — an Iranian twin-tail modification of the F-5E. @tower_eye, Tango Six The modest IRIAF participation was not only attributable to the Yasin accident. After all, most of the fleet comprises aircraft that are between 30 and 50 years old — if not older. Despite Iran’s ability to adapt to sanctions, maintaining such aging equipment is getting increasingly difficult. This was evident at the airshow itself — the F-14 flew only on the pre-show arrival day, performing a low pass, a turn, landing, and taxiing before remaining grounded for the remainder of the show, departing only on December 14. A planned race between an F-14 and a Lamborghini was canceled due to technical issues with the Tomcat. Instead, the Lamborghini was raced against a civilian aircraft, a Hawker Beechcraft 400XP from the local Toos airline. The participating F-14A (U.S. Navy Bureau Number 160334, Iranian serial number 3-6006) came from the 8th Tactical Air Base at Isfahan, which is home to Iran’s last three Tomcat squadrons: the 81st, 82nd, and 83rd Tactical Combat Squadrons. In contrast, the F-4 fighter, increasingly also a global rarity, fared better at Kish. Three F-4Es from the 91st Tactical Combat Squadron performed impressive formation flybys and solo passes over three days, operating out of their home base, the 9th Tactical Air Base at Bandar Abbas. F-4E Phantom fighter-bombers are currently the backbone of the IRIAF. @tower_eye, Tango Six As it stands, there is a strong likelihood that the F-4 will outlive the F-14 in Iranian service, in an ironic twist. After all, the F-14 was originally introduced as a Phantom replacement for the U.S. Navy’s carrier air wings. Back in 2023, an Iranian lawmaker told media in that country that Russia would deliver the first Su-35 fighters to the IRIAF 'in the coming months.' Shahriar Heidari, a member of the Iranian parliament’s National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, told the semi-official Tasnim news agency in January 2023 that the first examples of the Russian-made fighter were planned to be handed over to the IRIAF in the spring of 2023. While that never happened, there have since been more reports indicating that the delivery of Flankers to Iran could be imminent. It’s widely presumed that the aircraft in question would be drawn from a batch that was already built for Egypt, before the deal with Cairo collapsed, apparently under U.S. pressure. One of the Su-35s built for Egypt but never transferred to that country. via @nskplanes It’s unclear how many Su-35s Iran might be looking to acquire, but reports suggest that the IRIAF could be in line to receive 24 examples. Such a deal makes good sense for Tehran and Moscow. For three decades, Iran’s attempts to procure new Chinese- or Russian-made fighters to replace its aging fleets of F-4s, F-5s, and F-14s have failed, in the face of international sanctions. But Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has led to it being ostracized, too, and increasingly seeking military and economic relations with Iran. This burgeoning relationship has seen, most notably, Shahed series one-way attack drones heading from Iran to Russia, as well as being built locally in Russian factories. With Moscow finding it increasingly hard to sell arms, Iran is now very much one of the most realistic clients. Yet another Iranian F-5 upgrade, the Kowsar, in front of the F-14. @tower_eye, Tango Six While a true multirole fighter, and a generational leap above the F-14A, the Flanker-E is similarly a twin-engine fighter, equipped with a powerful fire-control radar, and has the potential to carry very long-range air-to-air missiles. It would therefore be an obvious replacement for the IRIAF’s Tomcats. In the past, Tasnim reported that at least some of the Su-35s are expected to be based at the 8th Tactical Air Base at Isfahan, where they would almost certainly supplement and eventually replace the F-14s of the 81st, 82nd, and 83rd Tactical Combat Squadrons. For now, however, there’s no sign of imminent Su-35 deliveries to Iran, meaning that diminishing numbers of F-14s will likely have to continue in service for some time longer. Živojin Banković gets up close to the F-14. @tower_eye, Tango Six With Iran firmly ostracized from much of the international community, chances to see the IRIAF’s F-14s will likely be vanishingly few from now on. With that in mind, the possibility of seeing just one of these rare ‘Persian Cats’ at the Kish Air Show is something that will remain long in the memories of those privileged to see it. With thanks to Petar Vojinović, Živojin Banković, and the team at Tango Six.

Wide-Scale Drone Flight Ban Prompted By Energy Infrastructure Vul...	The FAA announced it restricted drone flights over 22 energy infrastructure sites across New Jersey. The ban comes amid public concern about the objects that has grown to a fever pitch since the middle of November when we broke the story about a drone incursion over Picatinny Arsenal. While that story was on very limited but concerning base incursions by drones, it has since grown into an frenzy about drones invading much of New Jersey. Evidence that this is in any way the case has been elusive. Despite the restrictions, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) continues 'to assess there is no public safety threat relating to the reported drone sightings,' the department stated today. 'In coordination with the FAA and our critical infrastructure partners who requested temporary flight restrictions over their facilities, out of an abundance of caution, the FAA has issued temporary flight restrictions over some critical infrastructure facilities in New Jersey. ' Those red circles, 21 of them, represent new TFR’s over NJ… Temporary Flight Restrictions. Allegedly banning aircraft from flying over power / energy generation sites or transmission sites.

'DHS and other security partners routinely request the FAA establish TFRs to restrict drone flights in areas where the drones could be unsafe or pose a security risk.' The restrictions affect drones operating below 400 feet and last until Jan. 17. There is always the possibility that the timeline could be extended or additional communities have their airspace similarly closed. DHS provided us a list of all the sites requesting TFRs. They are mostly over Public Service Electric & Gas (PSE&G) facilities.

Also establishing aerial 'patterns of life' over these areas to get a better handle on what would be considered anomalous could be helpful and narrow down the types of responses required. At the same, putting these restrictions over critical energy facilities does indicate the vulnerability of them and concerns that they could be targeted, which makes sense from an adversarial perspective. We have still seen no evidence that this is any sort of an imminent possibility. Still, as we have reported on repeatedly, drones pose a danger to energy infrastructure and nefarious and bizarre drone activity at such sites has been an ongoing issue. What appeared to be the first actual drone attack on a power facility in the U.S. happened in 2020, which raised red flags in the intelligence community. Issued only for drones, the TFRs 'do not impact manned aviation including airplanes and helicopters,' DHS pointed out. In addition, there is no blanket ban on drones, DHS explained. 'There is an established process to request a waiver to fly in these TFRs, should that be necessary,' DHS stated. The TFRs explain that drones can only be flown over these towns under the following conditions: in direct support of an actual national defense, homeland security, law enforcement, firefighting, search and rescue, or disaster response mission. In addition, they can be flown if supporting events or commercial operations with a valid statement of work. The TFR issued for Evesham, New Jersey, one of 22 issued Wednesday across the state by the FAA (FAA) These are not the first TFRs issued in connection with the Jersey drone sightings. As we previously reported, the FAA enacted two prohibiting drone flights without prior permission over Picatinny Arsenal and the Trump National Golf Course Bedminster. The Picatinny TFR went into effect Nov. 25 and ends Dec. 26, while the one over Trump National was initiated Nov. 22 and slated to end Dec. 6, but was subsequently extended to Dec. 20. Regardless of the TFRs, the White House has continued to downplay concerns. White House National Security spokesman John Kirby told ABC News' Good Morning America program on Wednesday there is 'nothing' indicating the increase in reported drone sightings is a national security risk. 'There’s a use for drones and everything we are seeing so far is they are being used for lawful purposes,' he proffered.

Still, the hysteria over drones has grown to the point where the FBI and New Jersey State Police had to plead with the public not to shoot lasers or bullets into the sky at any object flying overhead. The warning was not hypothetical. Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst officials told The War Zone that pilots of 15 fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft from Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst had reported being struck by lasers from the ground since December 7. One of those pilots had to seek medical treatment but was quickly released, but all aircraft involved landed safely. NJ.com was the first to report these incidents but officials say they don’t know who fired the lasers. U.S. Army photo All this comes as drone incursions are being reported over military bases at home and abroad. Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton in southern California confirmed to The War Zone on Tuesday that it had experienced multiple such incidents over its airspace in the past several days. It joins a growing list of military installations in the United States experiencing recent drone incursions, which also includes Hill Air Force Base in Utah, which reported on Monday. Drones have also flown over Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio forcing the closure of its airspace, which we were the first to report. They also intruded on Naval Weapon Station Earle's airspace and several unknown aircraft recently followed a Coast Guard vessel. Drones flying over Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio forced the closure of its airspace recently. (Public domain) Last month, drones also appeared over four U.S. Air Force bases in the U.K., another story we first broke, and more recently also over Ramstein Air Base in Germany. Drone incursions over key U.S. bases and training ranges are nothing new and The War Zone has been on the leading edge of covering this topic for years. TWZ broke the story of the major drone incursions over Langley AFB a year ago, which marked a major change in how the DoD was approaching this neglected threat. Other such incursions involving UAS have taken place off the U.S. coasts and, as well as military bases, key civilian infrastructure has also been visited by mysterious drones. The new TFRs are another indication of how the government is trying to figure out what is going on in the skies, but the Biden administration has just a little more than a month to find the answers. President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, said he believes the government knows more than it is letting on and that the public should be told the nature of these objects. That is assuming there is anything to tell, beyond the military installation incursions. In the meantime, the issue remains cloaked in social media hyperbole, poor messaging, and speculation, with panic filling the ensuing information vacuum.

Putin Claims No Final Decision Yet On Russia’s Bases In Syria Des...	Russian President Vladimir Putin insisted today that his country is still exploring its options for retaining a pair of bases in Syria that have uniquely strategic value following the fall of longtime ally Bashar Al Assad. The new remarks stand at odds with Russia's drawdown of military forces and materiel in the Middle Eastern country already and clear signs this week that those departures are only ramping up. You can read more about what has already been observed at Russia's Khmeimim Air Base and Tartus naval base in The War Zone's past reporting here. A satellite image of Tartus taken on December 17 showing Russian forces massing there ahead of a possible withdrawal. Satellite image ©2024 Maxar Technologies Wood, Stephen Putin talked about Syria and a host of other topics in a freewheeling annual televised end-of-year press conference earlier today. 'We maintain relations with all the groups that control the situation there [in Syria], with all the countries in the region,' the Russian President said. 'The overwhelming majority of them tell us that they would be interested in our military bases remaining in Syria.' Putin did not offer any additional information to substantiate the latter assertion. 'I don't know, we have to think about it [Khmeimim and Tartus], because we have to decide for ourselves how our relations will develop with those political forces that now control and will control the situation in this country [Syria] in the future,' Putin added. 'Our interests must coincide.' 'If we stay there, it means we must do something in the interests of the country where we are,' he continued. 'What the interests will be, what we can do for them – this is a question that awaits painstaking study from both sides.' When asked about keeping military bases in Syria, Putin responded that &#034;many Middle Eastern countries&#034; want them to keep their bases, but that Russia would &#034;have to think about it&#034;. This sounds very much like angling to make leaving Syria Russia's decision.&mdash; Oliver Alexander (@oalexanderdk.bsky.social) 2024-12-19T11:26:36.109Z Yeah, Russia has no current deal to keep its bases in Syria.Every statement by Putin today is aimed at saving face in front of the Russian people when they eventually leave.&mdash; Oliver Alexander (@oalexanderdk.bsky.social) 2024-12-19T12:03:20.541Z 'You want to portray everything that is happening in Syria as some kind of failure, a defeat for Russia. I assure you, it is not. And I'll tell you why,' Putin declared at one point. 'We came to Syria 10 years ago to prevent a terrorist enclave from being created there.' 'On the whole, we have achieved our goal. It is not for nothing that today many European countries and the United States want to establish relations with them,' he continued. 'If they are terrorist organizations, why are you [the West] going there? So that means they have changed.' Many countries, including the United States, have been in contact with Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which headed the rebel coalition that ousted Assad, in the past few weeks. HTS is now working to form a transitional government in Damascus. At the same time, the U.S. government, as well as that of Russia, among others, still formally designates HTS as a terrorist organization. American authorities have a $10 million bounty out on HTS leader Ahmed Hussein Al Shar’a, better known by his nom de guerre Abu Mohammad Al Jolani (or simply as Jolani). Russia was actively fighting anti-regime rebels, including HTS, just two weeks ago. In addition, Putin today tried to downplay Russia's extensive military presence in Syria and any culpability for Assad's fall. Instead, he blamed the poor performance of Assad's armed forces and its Iranian allies for the rapid collapse of the regime. Russia's President claimed that his country had helped some 4,000 Iranian personnel evacuate the country via Khmeimim. Putin also added that he had not met with Assad since the former Syrian dictator reportedly arrived in Moscow nearly two weeks ago. The deposed Syrian leader has not been seen in public for weeks now. Not making this up.

Some of the so-called 'pro-Iranian units' retreated without fighting to Liban, some to Iraq.&#034;&mdash; Status-6 (Military & Conflict News) (@archer83able.bsky.social) 2024-12-19T11:51:07.744Z Overall, Putin's comments at the press conference today strain credulity. The fall of Assad has been a huge blow to the Kremlin with ramifications well beyond the Middle East. This includes the fate of Khmeimim and Tartus, which have provided the Russians with highly strategic nodes for projecting air and naval power out in the Mediterranean, including along NATO's southern flank, and into Africa. The Russian intervention in Syria beginning in 2015 was absolutely critical for both propping up Assad's regime and maintaining access to those facilities. Assad essentially gifted those bases to Russia through a 49-year 'lease' deal in 2017 and the Kremlin has invested significant resources in expanding them since then. Al Monitor reported today, citing anonymous Russian diplomatic sources, that a final decision about Khmeimim and Tartus could come next March. The New Arab reported earlier this week, again citing anonymous sources, that Russia's military could be ordered out of the country entirely within a month. Previous reports have also suggested that negotiations between Russian authorities and the rebels so far have centered on humanitarian and economic assistance, as well as questions about diplomatic ties. Satellite imagery, along with pictures and videos from sources on the ground, have shown Russian forces, including an S-400 surface-to-air missile system and other key air defense assets, already withdrawing Khmeimim. Materiel and personnel are also massing at the air base, as well as in Tartus, pointing to plans for more significant drawdowns to come. A satellite image taken on December 15 of Khmeimim notably showing the absence of an S-400 surface-to-air missile system that had long been in place at the base. The empty positions where elements of the S-400 had been emplaced are seen here to the left of the aircraft apron.

A picture has now emerged, seen below, said to show the Russian Navy frigate Admiral Grigorovich refueling via a tanker ship off the Syrian coast in order to maintain its station.

'We don’t know if they’ve reached the decision to do that, or if they are in discussions on whether they need to do that or not, but that force consolidation that would enable them to depart has certainly happened.' There are growing reports that Russian forces from Syria are relocating, at least initially, to bases in Libya, which would be a logical development. 'Russian cargo planes have flown air-defense equipment, including radars for S-400 and S-300 interceptor systems, from Syria to bases in eastern Libya,' according to a report just yesterday from The Wall Street Journal, citing anonymous U.S. and Libyan officials. 'Russia has also flown troops, military aircraft, and weaponry out of Syria in a significant drawdown of its presence there.' The Journal did not name the bases in question. The War Zone has reviewed satellite imagery from Maxar and Planet Labs that look to show Russian movements at Al Jufra Air Base, Al Khadim Air Base, Al Qardabiyah Air Base, and Benina International Airport. However, these are facilities that Russia's military has been operating from for years now and it is still unclear whether what is being seen represents a significant uptick in activity.

The Kremlin has sought to establish a naval base in Sudan in the past. Syria otherwise continues to be in the midst of major geopolitical flux following the collapse of the former regime. While HTS is working to craft a new government in Damascus, much of the country remains under the control of various other internal and external actors, including Israel, the United States, and Turkey. U.S. and Israeli forces have also been striking targets across the country, aimed at preventing ISIS and other terrorist groups from capitalizing on the situation and former regime assets falling into rebel hands, respectively. In addition, there has been a notable surge in fighting between Turkish-supported rebels and U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in northeastern Syria, and there are fears a larger Turkish intervention could be imminent despite an American-brokered ceasefire. For, its part, HTS, which evolved from an Al Qaeda franchise in Syria, has sought to address concerns that it might try to establish an extremist Islamist state. 'In Syria, we spoke with all the communities, the Druze, who fought alongside us, the Christians, the Alawites, and the Kurds,' Jolani told foreign journalists earlier this week. 'Now, after all that has happened, sanctions must be lifted because they were targeted at the old regime,' Jolani also said in a separate interview with the BBC. 'The victim and the oppressor should not be treated in the same way.' Jolani 'tried to offer reassurance to all those who believe his group has not broken with its extremist past' but 'many Syrians do not believe him,' the BBC piece noted.

Israeli Air Force Strikes Yemen With Popeye And Rampage Standoff ...	Israel launched airstrikes on multiple targets in Yemen, including the capital of Sana’a, during the early hours of Thursday morning, while the Yemen-based Houthi militant group was conducting its own missile attack on Israel. The Israeli raids come after an uptick in attacks against Israel by the Iran-backed Houthis, including two in the past week. Israeli media reports claim that 14 Israeli Air Force (IAF) aircraft were already in the air, as part of a pre-planned operation, while the Houthi missiles were still inbound. F-15 and F-16 combat jets were involved in the operation, supported by aerial refueling tankers and intelligence-gathering aircraft. Armed with Rampage missiles, an F-16 takes off, apparently to strike targets in Yemen. IDF Videos and photos released by the IDF showed IAF F-15s and F-16s purportedly departing their bases for the raids. While the F-15s were armed with Popeye missiles, the F-16s were shown carrying the much newer Rampage missiles. Media reports out of Israel suggest that the strike aircraft took off around 1:00 a.m, with the first wave hitting the Yemen coastal area around 3:15 a.m., and the second wave striking the Yemeni capital around 4:30 a.m. An infographic released by the IDF suggests that the package passed through Saudi Arabian airspace en route to striking Yemen. מטוסי קרב וכלי-טיס של חיל-האוויר טסו הלילה קרוב ל-2,000 קילומטרים ותקפו בעזרת למעלה מ-60 פצצות, מטרות צבאיות של שלטון הטרור החות׳י ברצועת החוף המערבית ובעומק תימן. בין המטרות: מיכלי דלק ונפט, שתי תחנות כוח ושמונה גוררות שהשבתתן פוגעת קשות בפעולותיהם הצבאיות של הכוחות החות׳ים. pic.twitter.com/wDxBoddma6&mdash; Israeli Air Force (@IAFsite) December 19, 2024 The IDF said it 'conducted precise strikes on Houthi military targets in Yemen, including ports and energy infrastructure in Sana’a, which the Houthis have been using in ways that effectively contributed to their military actions.'

The port facilities were selected since they are used to unload Iranian weapons being brought into Yemen to arm the militants. Here, the IDF claimed it attacked 'eight special large ships,' which reportedly could potentially close off access to the ports, even if only temporarily.

The exact type of missile used by the militants has not been independently verified. While claims by the group about the kinds of weapons it uses are frequently exaggerated, it should be noted that most traditional ballistic missiles also have hypersonic performance in their terminal phase of flight. Emergency responders inspect damage to a school in the city of Ramat Gan, after a Houthi missile strike, on December 19, 2024. Photo by Amir Levy/Getty Images Amir Levy As for the weapons used by the IAF in the raid, F-15s were shown carrying the Popeye standoff missile, also known by the U.S. designation AGM-142. This is a solid-fueled weapon, just under 16 feet long, and with a launch weight of almost 3,000 pounds. Armed with a roughly 800-pound high-explosive or penetrator warhead, Popeye has a range of approximately 50 miles. This is by now a fairly old weapon, with work on it having apparently begun in the early 1980s, followed by service introduction with the IAF in 1986. Popeye uses an inertial navigation system (INS) for midcourse guidance, before switching to a TV or infrared sensor for terminal guidance. It does this via datalink, allowing for man-in-the-loop control of the missile for final targeting. The Popeye is usually controlled by the launching aircraft or another crewed aerial asset from dozens of miles away, via a datalink pod that connects with the missile to establish line-of-sight radio connectivity. This allows for adjustments of the missile’s flight path all the way up to or very close to the point of impact, giving the missile extremely high levels of accuracy. In imagery released by the IDF, the datalink pod is shown under a central fuselage station on an F-15B/D Baz, as seen below. IDF Israeli F-16s, meanwhile, were shown carrying Rampage missiles, which are an air-launched adaptation of the ground-launched Extended Range Artillery guided artillery rocket, or EXTRA. Like Popeye, Rampage offers a significant standoff range, reducing risks to the launching aircraft, although, in the case of Yemen, the country has only very low-level air defense capabilities. Rampage is part of a growing arsenal of Israeli air-launched ballistic missiles and other similar aerial munitions, the importance of which has come into sharp focus this year, especially in retaliatory strikes on targets in Iran and also airstrikes in Lebanon. The missile was first publicly revealed in 2018 and has been pitched as an ideal tool for carrying out short-notice strikes on time-sensitive and well-defended high-value targets. Destroying air defenses is at the top of its use case, for instance. The weapon’s supersonic speed presents challenges for any air defenses attempting to intercept it, flying much faster than a cruise missile, for example. That also helps the missile burrow deeper into hardened targets if needed. The missile is able to hit targets more than 90 miles away, its manufacturer claims. An F-16 carrying Rampage missiles on the outer underwing stations, as well as three external fuel tanks and conformal fuel tanks. IDF As well as keeping out of range of air defense systems, the use of standoff missiles — alongside potentially other munitions, as well — reflects the fact that Israel has limited aerial refueling capabilities, which are otherwise needed to support long-range strikes. Popeye and Rampage are well suited to attacking highly defended targets at a distance without major support packages traditionally required to enable those kinds of strikes, removing the risk inherent in conducting such an operation deep inside hostile airspace. For instance, staging a combat search and rescue (CSAR) contingency operation for any downed aircrew, even if the result of a mishap, would be challenging and resource-intensive. So using standoff munitions for targets located deeper inside a hostile country solves a lot of problems and streamlines an aerial operation like this one. More generally, it’s notable that Israel is now regularly highlighting to the public some of the munitions used in long-range strikes against Yemen and Iran, as well as shorter-range ones in Lebanon. This kind of explicit messaging was very rare in the past and is engineered to present niche capabilities that have helped it conduct precision strikes against prized targets even deep inside Iran and, at least so far, do so with apparent impunity. The Israeli airstrikes were the third time that it has targeted Yemen since the start of the current war in the Middle East. The Houthis began their current campaign in solidarity with Palestinians killed by Israeli strikes in Gaza, the current round of which began in October 2023. Security forces loyal to the Houthis take part in a rally in the Yemeni capital of Sana’a, in support of the Palestinians and against the United States and Israel, on December 18, 2024. Photo by Mohammed HUWAIS / AFP MOHAMMED HUWAIS Israeli officials had recently begun to threaten a more concerted response to the Iranian-backed Houthis, which have been regularly firing long-range missiles and drones at Israel. According to the IDF, the militants have launched over 200 ballistic missiles and over 170 drones toward Israel. While most of these have been claimed by Israeli air defenses — assisted by the U.S. military and other allies — 22 have penetrated into Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared today: 'After Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Assad regime in Syria, the Houthis are almost the last remaining arm of Iran’s axis of evil. The Houthis are learning, and will learn the hard way, that those who strike Israel will pay a very heavy price for it.'

Photo by Ma'yan Toaf / Israel GPO / Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu A further threat to the Houthis came from Israeli Minister of Defense Israel Katz, who said: 'I warn the leaders of the Houthi terrorist organization: Israel’s long arm will reach you too.' Already, the Houthis have said they will respond to the latest Israeli airstrikes. Speaking today, one Houthi official said that the group would 'respond to escalation with escalation.' Muhammad al-Bukhaiti, a member of the Houthi political bureau, said: 'The American-Israeli bombings of civilian facilities in Yemen expose the hypocrisy of the West. Our military operations to support Gaza will continue, and we will respond to escalation with escalation until the crimes of mass extermination in Gaza stop and the possibility of bringing food, medicine, and fuel into the strip is allowed.' Another view from the Houthi-controlled Haziz power plant, in Sana’a, Yemen on December 19, 2024. Photo by Mohammed Hamoud/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu Iran — the major military backer of the Houthis — also condemned the Israeli attacks. Esmaeil Baqaei, a spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry, said the attacks were 'a flagrant violation of the principles and norms of international law and the U.N. charter.' According to Israeli media reports, Washington was alerted to the IAF airstrikes in advance. The latest Israeli attacks on Yemen follow U.S. airstrikes against Houthi targets in the same country, although these have tended to focus more on Houthi weaponry, including to blunt the militants’ anti-shipping attacks in the Red Sea. The latest round of airstrikes, coupled with the ramping up of Israeli rhetoric surrounding follow-up raids, suggests that there could be more to come. Time will tell whether we will see a broader campaign, but with Hamas and Hezbollah now significantly degraded as fighting forces, and regime change in Syria, Israel certainly has more capacity for dealing with the Houthis.

Navy’s Future E-130J TACAMO ‘Doomsday Plane’ Seen In New Renderin...	Northrop Grumman has released a new rendering of the U.S. Navy's future E-130J aircraft to support the Take Charge And Move Out (TACAMO) mission. TACAMO is a critical component of America's deterrent posture and involves providing airborne command and control support for nuclear ballistic missile submarines, including being able to send orders to them to launch strikes while submerged. Aircraft that support nuclear missions like TACAMO are commonly called 'Doomsday planes.' The rendering was included in a press release this evening from Northrop Grumman announcing its selection to lead the conversion of Lockheed Martin C-130J-30 cargo planes into new E-130J configuration. The E-130J contract, which covers 'three Engineering Development Models (EDMs) and options for up to three System Demonstration Test Articles (SDTAs) and up to six aircraft in the first lot of production,' is valued at approximately $3.549 billion, according to a separate U.S. Navy release. The E-130Js are set to replace the Navy's Boeing 707-based E-6B Mercury aircraft, which currently support the TACAMO and U.S. Air Force's 'Looking Glass' Airborne Command Post missions. One of the US Navy's existing E-6B Mercury aircraft. DOD Lockheed Martin's famed Skunk Works advanced projects divisions, as well as, Raytheon (though its Collins Aerospace subsidiary), Crescent Systems Inc., and Long Wave Inc., are also part of the Northrop Grumman-led team. In November, Lockheed Martin, via the Navy, released pictures, one of which is seen below, showing the cockpit section of the first C-130J-30 destined to become an E-130J. Lockheed Martin via USN Kathy Hieatt The C-130J-30 is a stretched version of the baseline C-130J cargo aircraft. The new Northrop Grumman rendering shows the E-130J will have a large satellite communications (SATCOM) dome on top of the forward end of the fuselage, similar to the one found on the current E-6Bs. Past renderings showed the dome at the rear end of the top of the fuselage. A previous rendering of a C-130J-30-based TACAMO aircraft from Lockheed Martin. Howard Altman The top of the fuselage is dotted with various other antennas, as well, which makes sense given the robust and secure communications suite the TACAMO aircraft must carry. A pair of spike antennas are also seen under each wing. These are also found on the Mercury jets, as well, and are tied to high-frequency communications arrays. A significantly extended landing gear sponson is visible on the left side of the aircraft in the new E-130J render. This is a unique modification that could have multiple uses, from helping to cool onboard electronics to housing antenna arrays. The bottom of the aircraft is not visible, but past renderings have shown additional blisters for downlink antennas needed to connect with ground entry communications points. The rendering also shows the E-130J's most visibly unique feature, a pair of long trailing wire antennas with drogues at the end for the aircraft's very low-frequency (VLF) communications system. Those antennas are miles long and TACAMO aircraft have to fly slow, steep. tight circular patterns when they are in use so that the tips fall vertically down. This is the system used to communicate with submerged submarines, which you can read more about here. Another look at the new E-130J rendering with the various antennas and other features visible. Northrop Grumman Before the introduction of the E-6 series at the very end of the Cold War, the Navy actually used specially modified EC-130G and Q aircraft to perform the TACAMO mission. The arrival of upgraded E-6B jets in the 1990s led to the consolidation of the TACAMO and Looking Glass missions. The smaller E-130J will allow for more distributed operations from a larger number of airfields. The Navy has also cited a variety of other cost, logistics, maintenance, and training benefits as driving its decision to return to a C-130-based platform in the past, as you can learn more about in detail here. C-130 variants, including multiple subvariants of the J model, are in widespread use across the U.S. military, as well as with allies and partners. The E-6Bs were converted from some of the last 707s ever produced. As noted, the larger and higher-performance Mercury jets currently perform two mission sets, TACAMO and Looking Glass, as well. 'Northrop Grumman has invested more than $1 billion in digital engineering and manufacturing capabilities that will assist in rapidly designing, building, testing, and sustaining the E-130J,' Northrop Grumman said in its release. 'The effort will incorporate Northrop Grumman’s technology leadership in advanced manufacturing, agile design, digital engineering and weapon system integration expertise to take advantage of Day One readiness across the Northrop Grumman-led industry team​.' It is also important to note here that the current plan is for the E-130J to supplant the E-6B only when it comes to the TACAMO mission. How the Air Force will continue to meet its Looking Glass mission requirements is not entirely clear, though its future fleet of Boeing 747-based E-4C Survivable Airborne Operations Center (SAOC) could help meet those needs, at least to a degree. A rendering of the future E-4C SAOC for the US Air Force. SNC 'Today is a tremendous day for the future of naval aviation’s contribution to our nation’s nuclear deterrence mission,' Navy Capt. Adam Scott, head of the Navy’s Airborne Strategic Command, Control and Communications Program Office (PMA-271), said in a statement. 'With the selection of Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation as the prime contractor for the TACAMO Recapitalization Program, we are ready to move out with developing this critical asset. In carrying on the legacy of the E-6B Mercury, the E-130J will ensure our nation’s leadership is always connected to its nuclear forces for decades to come.' 'Our TACAMO mission is foundational to our nation’s nuclear Triad,' Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro said in a separate statement. 'The E-130J will carry on the proud legacy of Navy TACAMO aircraft and keep our nation safe.' With the contract to Northrop Grumman today, the Navy has now fully embarked on a path to fielding its next Doomsday planes.

Pentagon Warns Of China’s Increasing Capacity To Project Naval Po...	China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) has expanded its global reach and moved more regularly and in greater mass beyond its regional waters in the past year as it continues to roll out warships and logistics support vessels that provide the force with greater range. That’s one finding from the unclassified version of an annual Pentagon’s report to Congress on China’s military that was released Wednesday. The 182-page report assesses the state of the force up through early 2024. It doesn’t indicate when the PLAN, which numbers more than 370 vessels, might be able to operate with regularity close to American coastlines, but it addresses other areas where the People’s Republic of China (PRC) is bolstering its maritime power projection capabilities. China's first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning. (AFP via Getty Images) 'These have included efforts to increase the PLA Navy’s distance sea training … that includes in the eastern Indian Ocean and in the western Pacific Ocean,' a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Monday, ahead of the report’s rollout. 'And they also have a pretty significant level of global engagements, including port calls as distant as the Middle East and Africa. So I think that’s a pretty good encapsulation of where they are right now.' As the PLAN emerges as a global maritime player, one that has had a continuous presence in the Gulf of Aden since 2008 via its permanent base in Djibouti, the service’s surface and undersea platforms are propelling this growing capability that can enable combat operations beyond the reach of the nation’s land-based defenses, the report states. In addition, its growing aircraft carrier force is extending air defense coverage for deployed task groups, while its 'emerging requirement for sea-based land-attack systems will enhance the PRC’s ability to project power,' the report notes. 'Furthermore, the PLAN has a sizable force of highly capable logistical replenishment ships to support long-distance, long-duration deployments, including two new FUYU class fast combat support ships (AOEs) built specifically to support aircraft carrier and large-deck amphibious ship operations,' the report states. 'The PLAN’s expanding fleet of large modern amphibious warships enable it to conduct a wide range of expeditionary operations wherever PRC interests are threatened or in support of PRC participation in internationally sanctioned operations.' TWZ has reported on a myriad of PLAN operations in recent years that reflect this increased global ambition. A U.S. Coast Guard vessels trailed four unidentified Chinese warships sailing in America’s Exclusive Economic Zone off Alaska’s Aleutian Islands in August 2021 and Chinese ships have had a sporadic, but increasing presence there since. A PLAN task force in the Mediterranean Sea back in July 2017 with warships calling on St. Petersberg in Russia, in the Baltic Sea, as well.

(www.twz.com) China’s global maritime goals are further aided by a surface warship and submarine-building industry that is believed to have 200 times more capacity than its American counterparts, the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) warned in 2023. As it pursues a 'strong and modernized navy force' on the high seas, the PLAN has worked to update or replace previous generations of naval platforms that had limited capabilities, in favor of bigger, modern multi-mission combatants, according to the Pentagon assessment. 'Today, the PLAN is largely composed of modern multi-role platforms featuring advanced anti-ship, anti-air and anti-submarine weapons and sensors,' the report states. 'The PLAN is emphasizing maritime joint operations and joint integration with the other branches of the [People’s Liberation Army]. This modernization aligns with the PRC’s growing emphasis on maritime domain and increasing demands for the PLAN to operate at greater distances from mainland China.' Among those new ships, the service in 2023 certified an eighth Rehnai class guided-missile cruiser that deployed with a 112-cell Vertical Launching System (VLS) array that can fire land attack, anti-ship, anti-air and anti-submarine weapons, along with radar, communications and sensors that increased its situational awareness. A Chinese Type 055 warship. (Uncredited image) Also known as the Type 055 design, the Renhai class dwarfs comparable U.S. warships, as TWZ reported in 2022: 'At just over 590 and a half feet long and with a full displacement of between 12,000 and 13,000 tons, the U.S. military, among others, categorizes the Type 055 design, also known in the West as the Renhai class, as a cruiser rather than a destroyer. For comparison, the U.S. Navy’s future expanded Flight III Arleigh Burke class destroyers will be 509 and a half feet long and displace around 10,864 tons. In terms of general lengths and displacements, the Type 055s, are also larger than the Navy’s 567-foot-long and 10,752-ton-displacement Ticonderoga class cruisers.' The service began launch tests of the electromagnetic catapults aboard its third aircraft carrier, Fujian, this year. Once operational, China’s third carrier will allow it to launch various specialized aircraft, 'increasing the PLAN’s power projection capability,' the report states. Go here to read more about Fujian, China’s first domestically produced and locally designed carrier and the first in the PLAN to launch aircraft via catapults and not 'ski jump' takeoff ramps. It is believed to be the nation’s most capable carrier yet and was named in a high-profile 2022 event. China’s carrier fleet, which also includes the Liaoning and the Shandong, were all concurrently at sea for the first time in September. PLAN’s carrier force is escorted by the service’s newest and most capable surface combatants, including the aforementioned Type 055, the Type 052 Luyang III and Luyang III MOD class guided-missile destroyers, which 'will likely be equipped with a planned naval variant of the Z-20 helicopter,' a medium-lift multi-role helicopter analogous to the MH-60R Sea Hawk. The PLAN also had eight Type 071 Yuzhao class landing platform dock ships (LPD) and four Type 075 Yushen class amphibious assault ships (LHA) in its armada as of December 2023, according to the Pentagon report. TWZ reported in August 2024 on a Yuzhao class LPD spotted with a laser onboard for testing. Kunlun Shan, the lead ship of China's type 071 vessels. (South China Morning Post via Getty Images) Meanwhile, China is readying a monster-sized amphibious assault ship known as the Type 076, which the U.S. military now also refers to as the Yulan class. Featuring a large open flight deck, TWZ reported in May 2024 that the ship could feature catapults and arresting gear to support an air wing that includes uncrewed combat air vehicles (UCAV) and other fixed-wing drones. Size-wise, satellite imagery showed it was roughly in between the Type 075 amphib and the carrier Fujian in size. 'The PLAN’s expanding fleet of large modern amphibious warships will enable it to conduct a wide range of expeditionary operations to protect the [People’s Republic of China’s] interests or in support of international operations,' the Pentagon report states. Beyond its permanent base in Djibouti, the PLA is 'very likely already considering and planning for additional military logistics facilities to support naval, air and ground forces projection,' the report states. Countries being considered for such hubs include Burma, Thailand, Indonesia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates, Cuba, Kenya, Equatorial Guinea, the Seychelles, Tanzania, Angola, Nigeria, Namibia, Mozambique, Gabon, Bangladesh, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and Tajikistan. Beijing views internal conflicts in Ethiopia and Sudan, or the Iran-backed Houthis’ ongoing attacks on vessels transiting the Red Sea, as proof that China needs a military that can operate farther from the homeland.

(STR/AFP via Getty Images) 'The PRC asserts that military logistics facilities, like its Djibouti base, will be used to provide international public goods like [humanitarian aid and disaster relief] and secure the PRC’s lines of communication, citizens, and assets abroad,' the report states. TWZ also reported Wednesday on the Pentagon report’s section on Chinese air asset development, including the stealthy, long-awaited H-20 bomber. While U.S. officials don’t expect it to be operational until the next decade, such a capability would further Beijing’s reach in the skies, even as the PLAN makes progress on the seas. An expanding and further-reaching Chinese navy will have increasing implications on the current global order, a Pax Americana backed by U.S. Navy gray hulls since World War II. It will see Beijing's flotillas heading further east, putting them closer to critical U.S. territories on a regular basis. How the U.S. will deal with this new reality as its own fleet is struggling to expand its capacity is yet to be seen.

New Jersey Base Confirms Multiple Past Drone Incursions… By Contr...	Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey has confirmed to The War Zone that it has countermeasures in place to deal with drone incursions and that it has recorded multiple such incidents this year. At the same time, a spokesperson has said that these past incidents relate to efforts to smuggle contraband into a federal prison within the base’s perimeter. 'Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst has countermeasures in place to detect, respond to, and deny unauthorized drone use over our facilities, which have standing flight restrictions that prohibit unauthorized UAS operations,' base spokesperson Kitsana R. Dounglomchan, told us. A satellite view of Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, including the prison at FCI Fort Dix. Google Earth 'This year, there have been multiple drone detections, involving attempts to smuggle contraband into the federal correctional institution hosted on our base,' Dounglomchan added. 'We take each case seriously and aggressively coordinate with local law enforcement to ensure the safety and security of our installation. The majority of the drones were intercepted or recovered.' New Jersey has been the epicenter of an unprecedented, but still very nebulous, drone scare that has gripped the public's attention. The Defense Department’s only tri-service installation, the sprawling Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst covers 42,000 acres and is home to five wings, hosted by the 87th Air Base Wing. Its flying units are primarily involved in airlift with the C-17A Globemaster III and aerial refueling with the KC-46A Pegasus. Also at the base are the shadowy C-32Bs operated by the 150th Special Operations Squadron, which are used for various clandestine airlift missions, as you can read about here, while the facility also supports unique VIP airlift missions, using specially configured C-17s. U.S. Air Force airmen assigned to the 305th Air Mobility Wing pose for a flight line photo on May 10, 2023, at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, N.J. The KC-10 Extender seen on the right of the photo has since been retired. U.S. Air Force Senior Airman Matt Porter FCI Fort Dix is the largest single federal prison in the United States based on the number of inmates housed there. It’s described as a 'low-security federal correctional institution with an adjacent minimum-security satellite camp.' In the past, there have been efforts to use drones to smuggle into FCI Fort Dix contraband including cell phones, cell phone accessories, drugs and tobacco, weight loss supplements, and various other items. In one such case, involving an inmate at Fort Dix from April 2018 to March 2019, the U.S. Attorney’s Office, District of New Jersey said that drone drops were planned 'during the late evening hours or overnight when it was dark, and the drones were less likely to be seen.' A drone pilot 'flew the drones from concealed positions in the woods surrounding the prison.' The same account notes that tape was used to cover any lights on the drones to make them harder to spot. Photo of FCI Fort Dix. United States Justice Department The same Air Force spokesperson confirmed that the last such of a contraband-carrying drone took place in September of this year, with no mention of any other drone incidents since then. The type of countermeasures in place at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst was not disclosed, but the need for such systems is clear, with the contraband smuggling attempts described as a 'long-standing challenge.' Earlier this year, the Pentagon announced that the base had hosted counter-UAS threat awareness training for the resident 719th Composite Truck Company, part of the New York Army National Guard. The training was described as identifying the fundamentals of Army C-UAS operations, namely 'better understanding the UAS threat, understanding threat UAS employment, identifying UAS countermeasures, recognizing and reporting threat UAS, and reacting to threat UAS.' While such skills are increasingly vital for deployed operations, they would also be relevant for the defense of the base’s own airspace against drone incursions. Soldiers of the 719th Composite Truck Company participate in counter-UAS threat awareness training earlier this year. U.S. Department of Defense Kevin C Mcdevitt Outside of Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, the Pentagon has provided limited details of drone countermeasures actions that have been taken elsewhere in New Jersey, specifically at Picatinny Arsenal and Naval Weapons Station Earle. 'When we detect them, [we] attempt to classify them and take appropriate measures,' Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters yesterday, including from The War Zone. Commanders at those other two installations 'have the authority to respond appropriately, and we’ll continue to do that,' Ryder added. 'In addition to some of the capabilities that are already on these installations, these capabilities essentially will enhance a base authority’s ability to detect, identify, and track UASs,' Ryder explained. 'So for example, this could include active or passive detection capabilities, plus capabilities like the system known as Dronebuster, which employs non-kinetic means to interrupt drone signals and affect their ability to operate.' However, there are very real limitations as to what the Air Force can do in terms of dealing with domestic drone threats, with a complex set of laws and doctrines restricting how and when counter-drone systems of any kind can be employed within the homeland — something that we have explored in detail in the past. Specifically, directed energy (lasers or high-power microwave) weapons, gun systems, or missile interceptors are not cleared for use in drone incursion incidents in the United States. Alongside these limitations, it’s worth noting the different tiered capabilities (and associated rules of engagement) that relate to the current counter-drone capabilities. This begins at the very lowest end with systems intended to increase situational awareness, typically through passive signal detection and tracking of electronic emissions. After this there are active sensors, typically radars, able to track a drone regardless of whether it is emitting radio frequency energy or not. Both passive and active systems can further be paired with electro-optical and infrared cameras to help with positive target identification. Next in the capability ladder are non-kinetic ‘soft kill’ defense options like electronic warfare, followed by directed-energy weapons like lasers and high-power microwaves, and finally more traditional kinetic effectors like drone-hunting drones, anti-aircraft guns, and even surface-to-air missiles. Ryder later confirmed to The War Zone that the Dronebuster — a man-portable, radio-frequency jamming system — is being issued to Picatinny. Dronebuster equipment is already in use at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, as confirmed by photos showing personnel from the resident 87th Security Forces Squadron training with the devices as long ago as 2020. An 87th Security Forces Squadron airman aims a Dronebuster device towards a drone operated by the Civil Air Patrol during a training event on Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey, Jan. 31, 2020. U.S. Air Force Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst had already been mentioned in relation to the recent wave of drone sightings at bases across the country — something that has happened especially in New Jersey and other states in the northeast. Yesterday, the base told The War Zone that pilots of 15 fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft from Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst had reported being struck by lasers from the ground since December 7. One of those pilots had to seek medical treatment but was quickly released, but all aircraft involved landed safely. NJ.com was the first to report these incidents but officials say they don’t know who fired the lasers. What we do know is that the current hysteria around the topic — driven to a considerable degree by social media accounts and much of the mainstream media —has led to the FBI issuing a plea for people to not fire lasers or bullets at anything in the sky, whether they think it is a drone or not. C-17A Globemaster IIIs assigned to the 305th Air Mobility Wing on the flight line during a winter storm at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, N.J., Jan. 16, 2024. U.S. Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Aidan Thompson 'We are seeing an increase of pilots of manned aircraft being hit in the eyes with lasers as people on the ground think they see a drone,' cautioned Nelson Delgado, Acting Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Newark Field Office, which is leading the drone investigation. 'We are also concerned that people will take matters into their own hands and fire a weapon at an aircraft. Not only is this act against the law, but it poses an incredible danger to the pilots and passengers on those aircraft.' By now, the FBI has received more than 5,000 reports of drone sightings via its drone hotline, but fewer than 100 of these merited further investigation, the bureau says. Earlier this week, the FBI — together with the Pentagon, and the Department of Homeland Security — issued a statement that they have 'not identified anything anomalous and do not assess the activity to date to present a national security or public safety risk over the civilian airspace in New Jersey or other states in the northeast.' The comments provided by Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst offer an interesting angle on the current spate of drone incursions. This is something that The War Zone has followed closely since the initial such reports emerged, including breaking the story of the first reports of drones over Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey on November 18. In the meantime, drone incursions over other U.S. bases at home and abroad show no sign of abating, with Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton in southern California confirming to The War Zone yesterday that it had experienced multiple such incidents over its airspace in the past several days. In terms of U.S. military installations, Camp Pendleton joins a list of air bases in the United States that has experienced recent drone inclusions, which also includes Hill Air Force Base in Utah. That installation reported drone incursions on Monday. Starting last month, drones have also appeared over four U.S. Air Force bases in the U.K., another story we first broke, and more recently also over Ramstein Air Base in Germany. More generally, drone incursions over key U.S. bases and training ranges are nothing new and The War Zone has been on the leading edge of covering this topic for years. TWZ broke the story of the major drone incursions over Langley AFB a year ago, which marked a major change in how the DoD was approaching this neglected threat. Other such incursions involving UAS have taken place off the U.S. coasts and, as well as military bases, key civilian infrastructure has also been visited by mysterious drones. A drone sits on a landing pad during a training event on Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey, Jan. 31, 2020. U.S. Air Force In the case of Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst specifically, it’s notable that this base has long had a very specific drone problem to deal with and has addressed this — with at least some degree of success — using countermeasures that are also able to bring down these drones. The base’s experience is likely to be shared with other installations now facing similar challenges, although it seems to be the case that the New Jersey Joint Base has been dealing with consumer-type drones, which are more easily countered, while any more sophisticated types of drones will present a much tougher challenge when it comes to base defense.

These Are Saab’s Concepts For Its Next Generation Fighter, Drones	Swedish defense firm Saab has presented concepts for a potential new-generation crewed fighter and a series of drones that would be intended to work alongside it. With a long history of domestic combat aircraft development, a sixth-generation fighter and complementary stealthy drones make sense for Sweden, although there are big questions about whether this is a realistic prospect without joining forces with other countries. The future concepts appeared in a recent TV segment aired on Sweden’s SVT channel, where they were discussed by Saab’s Peter Nilsson, Head of Advanced Programs at the company. Screenshots from the broadcast were shared on social media by the Swedish military blogger @GripenNews. Saabs Peter Nilsson, head of Advanced Programs showing some future concepts for Swedish TV.Perhaps next step, a loyal wingman to #Gripen E. And an overall vision of multiple air system components sharing DNA. #FCAS #aerospaceScreen dumps & source: pic.twitter.com/p7QvxXmXgQ&mdash; Gripen News (@GripenNews) December 16, 2024 Most interestingly, the footage includes an overall vision for a future combat aircraft ‘ecosystem,’ with multiple related crewed and uncrewed systems. At this very early stage, the concepts should be understood as highly provisional, but they may or may not reflect design considerations that Saab is already addressing for Sweden’s next-generation air combat requirements. A close-up of a laptop showing the Saab Saab F-series concept aircraft. SVT screencap via X The ecosystem appears under the title Saab F-series and the subheading 'Same brain in different bodies.' From left to right, it consists of a crewed future fighter; a subsonic uncrewed platform with a weight of no more than five tons; the existing Gripen E crewed multirole fighter; a supersonic uncrewed platform with a weight of more than five tons; and a low-cost subsonic uncrewed platform with a weight of less than one ton. Of these, the Gripen E — which is on order and in production for both Sweden and Brazil — is already well known and you can read more about it here. The Saab Gripen E. Saab Saab’s proposed successor in the Saab F-series is presented as a crewed future fighter that appears to be tailored for high speed, as well as low observability. It has a sleek, blended wing/body configuration with a prominent chine running around the arrow-like forward edges, giving it something of a resemblance to the Cold War-era Saab Draken fighter, with its distinctive double-delta wing. The swept wings are cropped, and the fuselage appears to have area-rule optimization for supersonic efficiency. The empennage looks like it consists of outward-canted stabilizers, it is unclear if it includes vertical tails as well. Some of the same features found in the crewed future fighter concept — notably the overall blended wing/body and cropped wings — appear in the supersonic uncrewed platform, although this is shown as being somewhat smaller and it lacks any kind of tail surfaces. Two views of the supersonic uncrewed platform in the F-Series. SVT screencap via X Other depictions of the supersonic uncrewed platform concept include a higher level of detail, with stealthy chisel-type air intakes on either side of the fuselage and a prominent bulge roughly above where the engine nozzle would be, the function of which isn’t immediately clear. An underside view of the drone suggests significant internal capacity, for fuel and internal stores, although no details of the weapons bay are visible. Another view of the supersonic uncrewed platform in the F-Series. SVT screencap via X Captions for the supersonic uncrewed platform describe it as sharing the same afterburning General Electric F414 engine as the Gripen F, as well as some shared avionics and vehicle systems. On the other hand, the stealthy airframe, 'digital backbone,' communications systems, sensors, and AI technologies are all new. The F414 engine as used in the Gripen — as well as the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, and others. General Electric As for the lighter subsonic uncrewed platform, this is shown as being overall much closer in appearance to a ‘typical’ fifth-generation crewed fighter (like the U.S.-made F-35 or the Chinese J-35). It has relatively small delta wings and outward-canted vertical fins. Perhaps the most generic of the design concepts is that for the low-cost subsonic uncrewed platform, which has a broadly cylindrical perhaps slightly flattened fuselage and a moderately swept wing. It also seems to have outward-canted vertical fins, but these are straight rather than swept. Overall, its look is somewhat reminiscent of a subsonic cruise missile, albeit with a longer wingspan. Its weight class — less than one ton (less than 2,200 pounds) would also align it much more with a cruise missile, or a remote carrier — a versatile store somewhere between a missile and a drone. At such a light weight, the low-cost subsonic uncrewed platform could potentially also be launched from the crewed future fighter or fighter-sized uncrewed platform. In terms of relative sizes, there’s no indication that these representations are to scale, and the specified weight classes give a lot of room for differences, especially at the upper end for the supersonic uncrewed platform. It’s also worth comparing both the crewed future fighter and supersonic uncrewed platform concepts with a Saab wind-tunnel model of a supersonic, stealthy Loyal Wingman drone concept. This is a design that you can read more about here. A full view of the Saab Loyal Wingman concept in the L-2000 wind tunnel at the Royal Technical High School, Stockholm. Saab via X Suffice it to say, the wind-tunnel model shares with those two concepts the blended wing/body configuration, especially the chine around the forward edges, and outward-canted vertical fins. It also has cropped swept wings, although these are more complex, with prominent sawteeth on the trailing edges and what appear to be relatively very large control surfaces. It’s worth noting that the nature of a wind-tunnel model means that it necessarily has more detailed features — including weapons bays — and is closer to a potential finished form, while the concepts for the Saab F-series are far more generic. The wind-tunnel model with one open weapons bay. Saab via X However, the appearance of the F-series is itself interesting, reflecting Saab’s evolving plans for its Future Combat Air System (FCAS) program. Confusingly, the FCAS nomenclature is also used by rival British and pan-European future air combat initiatives, and all feature a crewed fighter at the center, as well as a range of supporting drones and other advanced technologies. At the same time, Saab was previously involved with the British FCAS program, before stepping aside from that. Concept artwork showing the Tempest crewed fighter that is part of the British FCAS effort. BAE Systems One notable feature of the Saab FCAS effort is the intention to have shared components across multiple crewed and uncrewed platforms, with the commonality between the unstealthy Gripen E and the stealthy supersonic uncrewed platform being especially interesting. Overall, such a philosophy should help drive down costs, speed development times, and reduce the maintenance and logistics burden once such systems are in service. Based on the diagram of the ecosystem, it would also appear that Saab considers the drones to be very much at the heart of the FCAS initiative, something that is perhaps not as immediately obvious with the rival British and pan-European programs, where the crewed fighter — at this point — is very much center stage. Examples of a Computational Fluid Dynamics evaluation for an earlier Saab Loyal Wingman configuration. This one also apparently features a stealthier engine exhaust. Saab via X Nilsson talks about plans to have some drones that 'will only be mock targets and [will] get shot down, but who might help so that you succeed in your mission.' This points to a vision for attritable drones — ones that are inexpensive enough to be willing to lose on high-risk missions while being capable enough to be relevant for those missions. It’s also noteworthy especially as the U.S. Air Force is now moving away from this idea, with attritable drones increasingly giving way to plans to achieve 'affordable mass,' pointing to force-multiplying drones that offer a good balance between affordability and capability. Some other details of the Swedish FCAS program are also presented in the TV coverage, including an ambition to replace the Gripen within the next 25 years — or around 2050. This puts the Swedish FCAS on a slightly longer timeline than is planned for the British and pan-European programs, both of which hope to have the crewed fighter component of their planned ‘system of systems’ in service sometime between 2030 and 2040. A video for the pan-European FCAS, reflecting an array of complementary technologies, among them a crewed combat aircraft, ‘loyal wingman’ type drones, and a new generation of air-launched weapons: The TV broadcast also makes it clear that the F-series is just one of the options that Saab is studying as it looks to develop a Gripen successor. According to the SVT report, a decision on what the Swedish FCAS program will look like will need to be taken 'within the next few years.' Interestingly the same report observes that having Saab design and develop those platforms is just one solution. Otherwise, Sweden would have to acquire an off-the-shelf solution, or more likely rejoin the British FCAS initiative — or even the pan-European one. One key aspiration for Sweden is that its FCAS program remains financially viable, even if it fails to achieve any export orders. This seems almost impossibly ambitious, bearing in mind the huge costs involved in developing a stealthy combat aircraft platform, let alone complementary crewed and uncrewed stealth platforms. Saab’s experience with the Gripen also shows that, whatever the capability of the product, gaining export sales is far from straightforward, especially when facing off against U.S. rivals. A pair of Saab Gripen E fighters. So far, this version of the multirole fighter has been ordered by Sweden and Brazil. Saab A pair of Swedish Gripen E test jets. Saab One other option might be for Saab to exclusively pursue one or more next-generation stealthy drone concepts, drawing on its experience with the Swedish Highly Advanced Research Configuration (SHARC), an experimental drone, as well as its involvement in the French Dassault nEUROn. Such a path would allow these uncrewed platforms to be paired with fighters, including the Gripen, giving it much greater survivability, while also accessing a larger marketplace in terms of exports. Decisions still to be made on the future of the Swedish FCAS program will determine whether we see any of the Saab F-series concepts progressing as far as prototypes or production aircraft. For the time being, at the very least, they provide an interesting insight into one country’s evolving thinking around the future of combat air systems.

China’s H-20 Stealth Bomber Unlikely To 'Debut' Until 2030s Accor...	The U.S. military says it still does not expect China's long-awaited H-20 bomber to make its 'debut' – unclear if this means its entrance into operational service or just its emergence publicly – until sometime in the next decade. Earlier this year, the People's Liberation Army Air Force's (PLAAF) deputy commander was quoted as saying the unveiling of the aircraft, at least, would be coming 'soon.' There have been reports for years now that the bomber, expected to be a stealthy flying wing design broadly reminiscent externally of the U.S. B-2 Spirit, could be about to break cover. A general assessment of the state of the H-20 bomber program is included in the U.S. military's latest annual report to Congress on Chinese military developments. The Pentagon released an unclassified version of the report today, which also says that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is still developing a stealthy medium-ranged bomber referred to in the past as the JH-XX. The 2021 PLAAF recruitment video below teases the forthcoming H-20 at the very end. 'The PLAAF is seeking to extend its power projection capability with the development of a new H-20 stealth strategic bomber, with official PRC state media stating that this new stealth bomber will have a nuclear mission in addition to filling conventional roles,' the report states. 'The PLAAF is developing new medium- and long-range stealth bombers to strike regional and global targets.' 'The PRC is developing a new generation of long-range bombers, likely named the H-20. The H-20, which may debut sometime in the next decade, will have a range of more than 10,000 km [nearly 6,214 miles], enabling the PLAAF to cover the Second Island Chain and into the western region of the Pacific,' another section of the report says 'The H-20 bomber’s range could be extended to cover the globe with aerial refueling. It is expected to employ conventional and nuclear weaponry and feature a stealthy design.' The 'Second Island Chain' mentioned here refers to an area of the Pacific to the west of a boundary that stretches between Japan and eastern Indonesia and includes the U.S. territory of Guam. The remarks here about the H-20 are also largely identical to what the Pentagon included in its China report last year. A map showing the general areas referred to by the terms 'first island chain' and 'second island chain.' DOD A map giving a general look at the First and Second Island Chain boundaries in the Western Pacific. DOD 'Unfortunately, I can't really go beyond what appears in the [new China report],' a senior U.S. defense official also said at media pre-briefing earlier this week in response to a question from The War Zone's Howard Altman about Chinese bombers. 'As you can imagine, we do try to make available as much information as we can, but I'm not able to go beyond what's in the report for now.' An official rendering of a stealthy flying-wing type aircraft, possibly meant to reflect the H-20, as seen in a 2021 PLAAF recruiting video. YouTube capture The latest comments on the H-20 are also in line with what a U.S. intelligence official told multiple outlets about the bomber earlier this year. 'The thing with the H-20 is when you actually look at the system design, it's probably nowhere near as good as U.S. LO [low observable; stealthy] platforms, particularly more advanced ones that we have coming down,' the intelligent official said during a briefing in April, according to Defense One. 'They've run into a lot of engineering design challenges, in terms of how do you actually make that system capability function in a similar way to a B-2 or B-21.' The H-20 has long been expected to be externally similar, at least in broad strokes, to the B-2 seen here. USAF 'Not really,' that individual also said when asked if the H-20 presented a concern to the U.S. military, according to Breaking Defense. A month before, the Chinese state-owned Hong Kong Commercial Daily newspaper had published an interview with Lt. Gen. Wang Wei, deputy commander of the PLAAF, where he was quoted as saying 'it's [the H-20] coming soon, just wait!' Lt. Gen. Wang should not be confused with People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) Lt. Cdr. Wang Wei, who died in 2001 while flying a J-8D Finback fighter after colliding with a U.S. Navy EP-3E Aries II spy plane, which caused a major international incident you can read more about here. 'There is no bottleneck [in the H-20's development], it can be solved,' Lt. Gen. Wang also said, according to the Hong Kong Commercial Daily. 'Our scientific researchers are now very good and all have this capability.' Development of the H-20 is understood to date back to at least the early 2000s. The Xi’an Aircraft Industrial Corporation (XAC), a subsidiary of the state-run Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), has been leading the project. XAC is also responsible for the many variants of the H-6 bomber, the original version of which was a license-built copy of the Soviet Tupolev Tu-16 Badger, as well as the Y-20 cargo plane, among other designs. Versions of the H-6 make up the PLA's current long-range aerial strike capabilities. An H-6 series missile carrier aircraft. Japanese Ministry of Defense No official imagery of the H-20 design has emerged to date, though the PLA and AVIC have teased the design for years now. This includes a 2018 AVIC promotional video that aped Northrop Grumman’s famous 2015 Superbowl ad (seen below) teasing what became known as the B-21 Raider. Images of wind tunnel models that could be related to the H-20 program or tangential designs, as well as a slew of speculative fan renderings, have also appeared online in the past. Past reports have also said the H-20 requirements call for a design capable of carrying up to 10 tons of ordnance, including land-attack and anti-ship cruise missiles, and an unrefueled range of around 5,000 miles (roughly 8,000 kilometers). Information about the regionally-focused JH-XX, which would have a shorter range and smaller payload capacity than the H-20, is even more scant. You can read more about what is known about that project, which AVIC subsidiary Shenyang Aircraft Corporation, better known for its fighters like the stealthy J-35, may be leading, here. A picture that has previously emerged showing a model of a design that might be tied to work on the JH-XX. Chinese internet As The War Zone has highlighted in the past, the H-20 would give the PLA a long-range nuclear-capable aerial strike capability well beyond what it currently possesses with even the latest versions of the H-6 family. That, in turn, would offer the ability to hold entirely new swaths of targets across the Indo-Pacific region, including the highly strategic outlying territory of Guam, Hawaii, and even parts of the continental United States, at risk. The PLA has already been working in recent years to expand its ability to conduct long-range aerial strikes with H-6 variants. This includes versions capable of launching very large payloads like air-launched ballistic and hypersonic missiles to significantly extend their reach. An H-6N missile carrier aircraft is seen here carrying a very large air-launched ballistic missile (as highlighted by the red arrow). Chinese internet In July of this year, a pair of H-6K missile carrier aircraft flew in international airspace near Alaska for the first time ever as part of a joint long-range aerial patrol with Russian forces. However, given the stated maximum range of the H-6K, which is also not capable of being refueled in flight, it is likely that those aircraft conducted their sorties from Russian bases. This underscores the continued limitations of the bulk of the H-6 series, though versions capable of being refueled in mid-air are increasingly being fielded, and the importance of the forthcoming H-20. H-6s are also not low-observable (stealthy) aircraft while potential air defense threats are only expanding. China and Russia conduct joint air strategic patrol over Bering Sea on July 25.

As we've written previously: 'With this range, the JH-XX would still have the ability to challenge strategic type targets, such as U.S. military facilities in Japan and possibly even on Guam, as well as bases in India, the South China Sea and beyond. The design could prioritize speed, as well as stealth, too. This could give the smaller fighter-bomber added advantages when it comes to sortie rates and for successfully penetrating through an enemy’s integrated air defense network. Above all else, it allows for multi-role operations, including supporting long-range air-to-air missions, without a heavy reliance on vulnerable tankers or even the use of coastal airfields, which would be the most vulnerable to attack during an all-out conflict.' When it comes to the H-20, even after a public debut, the PLA would need time to develop a true operational capability with the bombers. Unlike the U.S. Air Force, the PLA still has at best limited experience with very long-range air operations. This is something that the Chinese look to be trying to rectify now through more regular longer-range H-6 flights, particularly in cooperation with Russia. Aerial refueling capacity, which would be key to the H-20 reaching its full potential, is another area where China's armed forces are still lagging behind the United States, though efforts are underway to change that. 'The biggest…challenge for the Chinese side is actually not so much capability of actual systems, it's more capability of personnel to effectively employ those systems at speed and at scale. We, as a U.S. military, have a lot of experience fighting wars,' the aforementioned U.S. intelligence official who spoke on H-20 also said back in April per Defense One. 'And yes, you talk to any operator, and they'll tell you all the problems we have, but quite frankly, we're able to figure out how to execute kill chains. The Chinese don't really have anybody right now at all, in the PLA, who's actually been in a war.' At the same time, 'I don't want to rely on the Chinese not being good,' they cautioned at the time. 'Because we're not going to know they're not good until they're shooting at us, and I don't want to be in a position where I find out, Oh, they actually are that good.' As The War Zone regularly notes, the PLA continues to make significant strides in the development and fielding of increasingly more modern capabilities across all domains, including in space. This includes significant work on the aerial side, especially in regard to stealthy flying wing-type uncrewed combat air vehicles (UCAV) and other advanced drones. UCAVs are an area where the U.S. military continues to be absent, at least that we know of, despite an increasingly global resurgence of work on such designs. The U.S. military does say China is still actively pursuing both the H-20 and the JH-XX, even though they are still likely years away from becoming a reality.

Pentagon’s Assessment Of North Koreans Fighting In Kursk, Rate At...	Pentagon officials provided their latest assessment of the state of play on the battlefield, the role of North Korean troops in Kursk, and how what’s left of nearly $7 billion in funding for Ukraine could be allocated in the waning days of the Biden administration. Though Ukraine is losing ground in the east, especially around the key logistical hub of Pokrovsk, it would take several years before Russia could capture the entire Donetsk region based on the current pace of the conflict, a senior military official told The War Zone Tuesday afternoon. Meanwhile, Ukraine can hold its Kursk salient for at least the next few months despite increasing Russian pressure and the influx of North Korean special operations troops who are starting to take heavy casualties there, the official said. A North Korean soldier in Russia's Kursk region. (Via Twitter) As we previously noted, Pokrovsk remains a key tactical gridpoint for both sides, with most Russian advances toward the Ukrainian-held city coming from the south. 'The Ukrainians have been ceding some of that terrain and falling back to more defensible positions,' the official explained. 'So while the Russian soldiers have made significant progress&#8230;it's very short amounts of progress. And as Ukrainians get to more defensible positions, we think they'll be able to shore up the defenses and last for some amount of time defending Pokrovsk depending on how events on the battlefield play out.'

(Photo by Roman PILIPEY / AFP) ROMAN PILIPEY Despite months of bloody assaults, the city remains in Ukrainian hands. Its fall would have significant economic and tactical implications for Kyiv, the official surmised. The city has a 'fair amount of precious metals and minerals and things that are important to the Ukrainian economy over the long term,' the official pointed out. More immediately, Pokrovsk provides key lines of communication, allowing Ukrainian troops to maneuver in the region. Despite its importance, losing Pokrovsk would not necessarily spell doom for Ukraine’s defense. 'Just because they take Pokrovsk doesn't mean Donetsk falls,' said the official. 'There's a number of defensive lines after that. Even if they sustain their current rate of advance, it would take a couple of years for them to take Donetsk completely. That rate of advance could change one way or another. but just doing the math that's about what it would take right now.' There has been concern that losing Pokrovsk would cause Ukrainian lines in the area to buckle further, potentially creating an opening for Russia to thrust deeper toward Dnipro, another major industrialized region. 'It would be very important for the Ukrainians to hold onto' Dnipro, the official stated, adding that 'it is impossible to tell' which direction Russian troops would go if they did capture Pokrovsk. 'I think they are certainly focused on the tactical situation at hand there.' Pokrovsk is a key city for both sides. (Google Earth) The long grind toward Pokrovsk is taking a toll on Russia, the senior military official explained. The fight there is contributing significantly to Russia sustaining what the official said was about 1,200 casualties per day. That's a staggering figure putting pressure on Moscow’s long-term capability to keep up the fight at its current tempo in Ukraine. 'I've seen no indications that they're unable to regenerate' their troop strength, the official suggested of the Russians. 'So they do continue to regenerate. I don't think that can last forever, though. While they may be able to do that now, we certainly know that that's one of the concerns that they would have on how long [they could] sustain that regeneration over time. It's inevitable, quite frankly, that if they continue to sustain that level of casualty, eventually they have to look at another mobilization, which obviously would be a large political decision.' Meanwhile, 225 miles to the northwest, North Korean troops are adding to the pressure Ukraine faces in trying to hold onto what’s left of the 500 square miles of territory it captured in its August invasion. The Pentagon is seeing 'independent maneuver from the DPRK forces,' the senior military official stated, using the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea acronym preferred by Pyongyang. 'There is a lot of integration with Russian maneuver units up there as well.' The following video shows some of those troops in action. North Korean infantry attacks Ukrainian positions in Kursk. This is yet another confirmation that it is not just 'Ukrainian probelm.' When dictators joined to destroy a sovereign democratic country, it becomes the problem for the entire world. Because the next question is who is… pic.twitter.com/yUZ4zufo2e&mdash; Roman Sheremeta (@rshereme) December 14, 2024 The North Koreans are being used 'as small, light infantry… and a little bit of indirect fire usage with mortar platoons. and things of that nature that they've been employing. As far as the capabilities they're consistent with what you would think they would have, their lower caliber indirect fire capability, and then direct fire capability, and obviously the kind of communications equipment that you would expect.' Their complete lack of previous combat experience is contributing to increasing casualties, the senior military official pointed out. 'They're definitely up on the front line. They're taking casualties. Based on the latest understanding that we have as of this afternoon, we're looking at several hundred casualties…everything from wounds, up to being [killed in action] KIA.' That concurs with what Ukraine's Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR) previously reported. You can see some of those casualties in the following video. A group of North Korean soldiers hit by cluster munitions during an attempted assault in the Kursk region. pic.twitter.com/TeOA2Q39xu&mdash; MAKS 24 (@Maks_NAFO_FELLA) December 16, 2024 Those casualties cut across ranks, the senior military official said. 'I don't want to get too specific, but it would be all the way from the very bottom to very near to the top. Based on some of the targets that the Ukrainians [have hit] which have been command and control nodes, etc, you can understand what types of leaders might be in those locations.' As we previously noted, a North Korean general was said to have been wounded last month in a Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missile attack on a headquarters in Kursk. The incident was reportedly captured by a Ukrainian drone unit, which you can see in the following video. It is unclear at this time whether North Korea intends to bolster its presence of about 12,000 troops in Russia, the senior military official posited. 'I don't think we have any particularly good insights on if [Russian President Vladimir Putin has] asked for additional DPRK troops or whether [North Korean leader] Kim [Jong-un] has agreed or rejected that. We're obviously watching it closely and looking for indicators of that, such as troops getting prepared to move out of North Korea, etc, things that we can pick up from a variety of intelligence sources, but we don't have any real good indication one way or the other on that.' The Pentagon has more clarity, however, on Ukraine’s ability to maintain a significant presence in Kursk. 'It will be some time before the forces that the Russians have brought to bear there would be able to reduce that salient in any meaningful way,' the senior military official posited. 'The Ukrainians have been adjusting their long-range strikes and changes to U.S. policy now allow the Ukrainians to use U.S.-provided munitions and Western-provided munitions into Russia. Ukraine has conducted a number of [U.S.-produced Army Tactical Missile System short-range ballistic missile] ATACMS and other strikes with long-range munitions into Russia. Those have been successful at the tactical level. We're evaluating their operational effects, but we've certainly seen some benefits from those up front.' Ukraine has used U.S.-donated Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) short-range ballistic missiles to strike targets within Russia’s borders. (Via Twitter) via X Still, 'the Russians have made up significant ground in Kursk,' said the official, adding that 'it will be a hard fight for the Ukrainians to hold what they have. I have no doubt that they can hold it for a period of time that extends at least a few months into the future.' The senior military official agreed with previous reports that Ukraine has lost about 40% of the territory captured in Kursk during two major counter-operations. 'I don't have an exact percentage I can give you, but it has been a significant loss, and that is not an unreasonable estimate that you provided,' the senior military official told The War Zone, adding that a 'number of factors' will determine Ukraine’s ability to hold onto what it has taken in Kursk. 'It will depend on the effectiveness of the long-range strikes that the Ukrainians are conducting,' the senior military official explained. 'How effective are those? Do they pick the right targets, etc? And will depend on the performance really, of the individual soldiers on each side on the battlefield who will be learning every single day and getting better as they work to survive and fight there.' Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff Another huge factor in Ukraine holding on to territory will be how much support it will receive from the U.S. and its allies. With Donald Trump set to take office on Jan. 20, the Pentagon is scrambling to allocate about $6.8 billion in funds before they could dry up under the next administration. About $1.22 billion is left in the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) funding pool used to purchase weapons from manufacturers, a senior defense official told reporters Tuesday. The Pentagon anticipates spending those funds before the end of the year, that official added. Among other weapons, the money has been allocated to purchase interceptors for Patriot air defense systems and National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS) donated to Ukraine. The Biden administration has used USAI funds to provide Ukraine with Patriot and NASAMS interceptors. (Raytheon/Kongsberg Defense) Another $5.6 billion is left in the Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) pool of money that replaces items provided to Ukraine from U.S. stocks, the senior defense official explained, adding that it is unlikely that the entire amount will be spent before Trump takes office. 'We will continue to do drawdown packages for the remainder of this administration,' the senior defense official told reporters. 'But $5.6 billion is a substantial amount of authority, so I would certainly anticipate that there could be remaining authority that would transition and be available for the next administration to use.' Whether that happens remains a huge question. As we previously reported, Trump has promised to end the war quickly but hasn’t offered specifics. Vice President-elect JD Vance has repeatedly criticized the Biden administration's funding of Ukraine and called for freezing the frontlines where they are while others in Trump’s inner circle are more supportive of Kyiv. So in addition to losses piling up for both sides, Ukraine and Russia face another common challenge - the uncertainty of plans by a new administration.

Navy’s Cruiser Modernization A Lesson In How Not To Run Such A Pr...	A government watchdog report released Tuesday highlights problems in the U.S. Navy’s yearslong, multi-billion dollar Ticonderoga class cruiser modernization program. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) report sheds new light on the systemic issues that have plagued the effort, such as lax contractor oversight and a lack of understanding regarding what kind of work the ships would need before they could return to the fleet. At the same time, the GAO report highlights the corrosive effect of deferred maintenance and warns that the Navy hasn’t sufficiently codified reforms to prevent such a boondoggle from happening again, particularly as it embarks on an ambitious $10 billion modernization program for 23 ships in its Arleigh Burke class destroyer fleet. The U.S. Navy spent nearly $4 billion modernizing seven of its aging Ticonderogas over the past decade, according to the GAO. But only three of the large surface combatants will complete the modernization process, and none of those will gain an extra five years of service life as originally envisioned. Nearly half that money spent, $1.84 billion, was 'wasted' modernizing four cruisers that never returned to sea and were retired by the Navy. A graphic from a Government Accountability Office report on Navy cruiser modernization showcases how few cruisers the Navy has actually modernized. (Government Accountability Office) For the cost and relatively short extra service life of its three modernized cruisers, the service could have nearly bought two brand-new destroyers. 'While it is too late to salvage the cruiser modernization effort, failure to learn critical lessons poses risk to the future of the Navy’s surface fleet as it begins significant modernization efforts for other ship classes,' the report states. 'This is particularly true for DDG Modernization 2.0 and the amphibious ship service life extension and modernization. While some issues were unique to the cruiser effort, we observed shortfalls that span across the planning and execution of Navy ship maintenance and modernization periods.' The Ticondergoas carry Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAM) and serve as air and defense batteries and command and control platforms. They are also equipped with Harpoon anti-ship missiles, MH-60R Sea Hawk helicopters and execute anti-submarine warfare operations. They were built in the 1980s and early 1990s and act as the central node in the carrier strike group’s air and missile defense architecture, with their unique capacity to host the air defense commander of the strike group. The Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Cape St. George (CG-71) fires a missile. (U.S. Navy) There are nine cruisers still serving in the Navy today. Six are slated to be decommissioned in the coming years, while the other three–USS Gettysburg (CG-64), USS Chosin (CG-65) and USS Cape St. George (CG-71)-have been modernized or are close to finishing modernization and will serve out toward the end of the decade. As TWZ reported last month, modernization has included Aegis Combat System improvements, a new AN/SPQ-9B radar and upgrades to the existing AN/SPY-1B, as well as an updated SQQ-89A(V)15 sonar suite, Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) modifications, and other work. Gettysburg entered the Middle Eastern waters of U.S. Central Command this week along with the rest of the USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75) carrier strike group, where it will perform air defense functions in a region that has been plagued by Iranian-backed Houthi rebel missile and drone attacks for the past year. The Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75) underway in 2022. (U.S. Navy) Chosin completed modernization and sea trials in early 2024, and the Navy plans to deploy it once more before its planned retirement in Fiscal 2027. Work on Cape St. George continues, with the Navy planning sea trials for this fiscal year, which began Oct. 1. 'Like USS Gettysburg and USS Chosin, the Navy currently plans to deploy USS Cape St. George at least once before divesting the ship in fiscal year 2027, according to senior Navy officials,' the report states, adding that the Navy now plans to decommission all three ships by Fiscal 2030. The Navy has been working to have Flight III Arleigh Burke class destroyers take on the air defense command role of cruisers, but to date, the service only has one Flight III destroyer, and questions have been raised about the viability of having a 'maxed out' subclass of destroyers serving in such a capacity, TWZ previously reported. The GAO notes that the new Flight IIIs are facing 'significant delivery delays,' with some ships falling more than two years behind schedule. The U.S. Navy's first Flight III Arleigh Burke class destroyer, USS Jack Lucas (DDG-125). (U.S. Navy) TWZ has covered the fits and starts of the Navy’s cruiser modernization program, and Tuesday’s GAO report highlights the broader systemic failings that led to it. The Navy plans to divest its three modernized cruisers 'without fully assessing the implications to its force structure, including costs, benefits and risks,' according to the GAO, and the service will look to squeeze one more deployment out of those three ships before they are mothballed. But that decision, according to the GAO, 'is not based on the full knowledge of the condition of the ships and associated operational implications because the Navy has not completed a comprehensive assessment of costs, benefits and risks of divesting the ships, as well as of ship conditions.' Navy officials told the GAO that 'they do not see the value the cruisers bring to the fleet,' because they are unreliable and suffer longstanding issues such as hull cracking, while also being less capable in some regards than more modern destroyers. But those same officials also acknowledged that they have not conducted inspections to understand the reliability and condition of the modernized ships. Cruiser modernization dates back to 2012, when the Navy first sought to retire multiple Ticonderogas due to budget constraints. Congress rejected such proposals and funded the modernization effort, and the sea service planned a phased approach that would give 11 cruisers five years of extra service life each. But the Navy did not fully understand the condition of its cruisers before they entered modernization, and officials told GAO that the ships were in worse condition than they realized. This was due to the Navy cancelling maintenance periods for their ships earlier in their service lives, allowing problems like fuel tank cracks to fester and balloon into major problems by the time modernization commenced. The Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Gettysburg (CG-64). (U.S. Navy) 'For example, according to OPNAV officials, the Navy deferred cruiser maintenance periods during the 2000s due to the operational need for the cruisers during the Global War on Terror,' the report states. 'Then, Navy officials told us the Navy canceled maintenance periods for the cruisers between 2011 and 2014, because the Navy was planning to divest the cruisers.' The Navy tried to better understand the cruisers’ conditions after Congress funded the modernization, and while these surveys were 'comprehensive and robust,' the high volume of unplanned work that emerged 'indicates that these efforts to gain information were unable to make up for years of not tracking ship condition and deferring maintenance,' the GAO report states. Officials told the GAO that the service is getting better at tracking required maintenance, helping ensure that ships can meet their service lives. 'However, these improvements are more impactful as a preventive measure on newer ships that have yet to fall behind than for older ships where the Navy has already deferred significant maintenance and lost track of condition, as happened with the cruisers,' the report states. Under its so-called 'Phased Modernization Plan,' the Navy inactivated the seven cruisers and cut manning from 350 billets to a 45-sailor caretaker crew, to save costs. Midway through each cruiser’s modernization, the ships force was supposed to be brought back to a normal size to help reactivate the ship, a decision the GAO called 'unusual.' 'A ship going through maintenance or modernization typically would not have its crew significantly reduced or be inactivated, according to Navy officials,' the GAO report states. This led to a host of problems when it came time to turn a given cruiser back on. 'Inactivating the ships and reducing the crew made it more difficult for program officials to understand the condition of and maintain the ships, thus inhibiting accurate planning for the modernization effort,' according to the GAO. 'For example, according to Navy officials, it was hard to assess the condition of inactivated ship systems. Further, because the ships had reduced crews of 45 sailors and the systems were turned off, these systems further deteriorated.' The GAO’s report–which involved interviewing more than 100 officials–also found that the Navy 'did not effectively plan the cruiser effort,' leading to a high amount of unplanned work that resulted in schedule delays and cost growth, including 9,000 contract changes. 'The Navy has yet to identify the root causes of unplanned work or develop and codify root cause mitigation strategies to prevent poor planning from similarly affecting future surface ship modernization efforts,' the report states. Once work began on the cruisers, the Navy at times struggled to provide the proper level of oversight, the GAO report states. A 2018 decision 'restricted officials from assessing monetary penalties to contractors without senior leadership approval,' according to the GAO. And in 2020, leadership reduced inspections of contractor work by nearly 50 percent, actions taken 'to maintain strong working relationships with the contractors because of the Navy’s dependence on them to modernize its fleet.' A graphic in a Government Accountability Office report on the Navy's cruiser modernization efforts shows how contractor oversight was reduced. (Government Accountability Office) 'Despite widespread instances of poor-quality work during the cruiser modernization effort, [Naval Sea Systems Command] senior leadership discouraged [Regional Maintenance Centers] and contracting officials from fully using key quality assurance tools to maintain the industrial base and a positive working relationship with the ship repair industry,' the report states. 'This reduced the RMC’s ability to ensure that contractors were producing quality work. Further, Navy guidance does not set forth clear roles that enable coordination among several key stakeholders within the Navy, which further inhibited effective oversight of work.' The GAO highlights several ships in the dwindling cruiser fleet and their persistently subpar state, even after years of modernization work. The USS Cowpens (CG-64), decommissioned in August 2024, went through eight years of modernization and still needed roughly $88 million and three more years of work as of June 2022, according to GAO, and photos from the following year reveal rust and corrosion on the deck plate, as well as holes in its flooring. An image from the Government Accountability Office's report on Navy cruiser modernization showcases the sorry state of the USS Cowpens' (CG-63) deck. (GAO) Another, USS Vicksburg (CG-69), was decommissioned in July 2024. Officials estimated in 2023 that it would require an additional $100 million, which did not include the cost to dry dock the ship and fix its sonar dome. The combat information center aboard the Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Vicksburg (CG-69) after years of modernization work. (Government Accountability Office) Even cruisers that have completed modernization are having issues, according to the GAO. The deployed Gettysburg completed its modernization and sea trials in February 2023, and the Navy’s Board of Inspection and Survey ruled that the ship met the minimum standard for going to sea. But a year later, in January 2024, the same board identified 'several outstanding issues during an inspection of the ship’s condition.' 'For example, several elements of the weapons systems were inoperable or degraded and there were structural issues throughout the ship,' the report states. The Navy addressed several of these issues after that inspection, and the cruiser completed 18 days at sea in June 2024, including a successful missile launch and intercept using its updated combat systems software. But before Gettysburg deployed in September 2024, the ships force told GAO of problems with steering gear and hydraulic power unit parts, among others, and that the Navy cannibalized parts from already-decommissioned cruisers. 'According to the ship’s crew, propulsion plant and electric system failures were key concerns for the USS Gettysburg deployment,' the report states. Cruisers that entered modernization all suffered 'widespread contractor performance and quality issues,' with Navy Regional Maintenance Centers issuing 1,400 corrective action requests to contractors to fix their incorrect work, the report states. One contractor used 'unauthorized materials such as plastic wrap, tape with common store bought glue, expanding foam and and as seen on television sealant products' to fix large sonar dome cables on a cruiser not identified by name in the GAO report. Shoddy work aboard a Ticonderoga class cruiser that the U.S. Navy was modernizing. (Government Accountability Office) A sonar dome rubber window damaged by a contractor during a U.S. Navy cruiser modernization effort. (Government Accountability Office) In another instance, contractors installed gun foundations at an incorrect height, requiring them to be removed and reinstalled, which led to a four-month delay. 'In addition, the gun could not fire without hydraulic fuel leaking,' the report states. 'Ship’s crew officials told us that they did not discover this issue until combat systems sea trials. The Navy has since corrected these issues.' A main gun aboard a U.S. Navy Ticonderoga class cruiser. (Government Accountability Office) On another ship, quality assurance officials noted five contractor personnel in three separate areas of the ship using incorrect welding methods in a single day. The Navy also failed to ensure that contractor work was sequenced properly. This led to delays in contractors installing equipment, and incomplete cabling and electrical distribution, aboard Vicksburg, the ship’s crew told GAO. 'They also told us that these issues led to 22 tons of electronic equipment sitting idle with no air conditioning,' the report states. 'Officials said a lack of temperature control caused problems preserving the computer equipment used to operate the Aegis Combat System aboard USS Vicksburg and that most likely a large portion of the electronic equipment is not salvageable. As another example, crew aboard USS Chosin told us that a modernization team contractor was unable to test a key system because the ship’s ventilation was not working. This caused a delay in ensuring that all key systems were operational.' The GAO report points out how unusual it is for a ship in maintenance to be transferred from Naval Surface Forces to Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) and back, and Navy officials noted that transferring ownership should not happen again. Navy officials concurred with the GAO that such lessons should be codified, but also told the watchdog that the Navy could need to inactivate a ship, reduce its crew size and transfer ownership to save money 'in a budget constrained environment.' 'They also stated that Navy leadership needs to retain flexibility,' the report states. 'However, doing so would likely significantly increase the risk of the Navy experiencing poor outcomes, as occurred with the cruiser modernization effort.' The Navy faces other challenges to increasing its overall fleet size, as well as maintaining its current warships and submarines. The new Constellation class frigates are also mired in delays, cost growth, and other problems, which you can read more about here. This is what led the service to announce last month that it would be extending the service lives of a dozen more Flight I Arleigh Burkes into the 2030s to help maintain overall operational capacity, according to past TWZ reporting. The Navy is relying on modernization efforts to maintain fleet size. And while service officials express confidence that the destroyer modernization program will not repeat the cruiser mistakes of the past, GAO’s findings indicate that such pitfalls remain a possibility.

Satellite Imagery Shows Ramp-Up In Russian Forces Massing At Base...	New satellite imagery shows large numbers of Russian vehicles and other materiel amassed at its Khmeimim Air Base and Tartus naval base in Syria. The active withdrawal of forces from Khmeimim is also continuing. This all comes despite continued insistence from authorities in Moscow that they are still looking to strike a deal to keep these highly strategic and prized facilities following the fall of the Assad regime. The War Zone obtained the new imagery of both Khmeimim and Tartus, which was taken today, from Maxar. The company also provided an additional image of Khmeimim from December 15 that highlights the significant departure of Russian forces from the base even by that point. The latest image of Khmeimim, seen below, shows dozens of vehicles and other equipment arranged in rows on an open apron at the northwest corner of the base, along with an Il-76 Candid cargo aircraft. Assets are often arrayed in this way on the tarmac at air bases ahead of their loading onto aircraft. Two smaller An-26 Curl turboprop transport aircraft, as well as a jet-powered An-72 Coaler, are also seen in nearby revetments. Satellite image ©2024 Maxar Technologies Russian forces have already been withdrawing from Khmeimim. This is now further underscored by Maxar's December 15 image of a portion of the northeastern end base, which notably shows the S-400 surface-to-air missile system site that had been deployed there for years has now been completely dismantled. Work to withdraw to the S-400, as well as other air defense assets, had already been observed at Khmeimim. Satellite image ©2024 Maxar Technologies Four Il-76s and Yak-40 small airliner are also seen on an open apron there. One of the Il-76s, as well as the Yak-40, belong to Syrian Airlines and there is the possibility that this Candid may have been one that went missing in the final chaotic moments of Assad's regime, are you can read more about here. There are also multiple helicopters visible, some of which appear to be missing their rotor blades. This could be a sign that they are being broken down to be loaded into transport planes. It appears that this Mi-8 is currently in the process of being taken apart for transport. It is missing its main rotor which was present on the image from a few days ago.Them dismantling helicopters is a very good sign that the base will cease to exist pic.twitter.com/xMMbbkUr47&mdash; Oliver Alexander (@OAlexanderDK) December 17, 2024 At Tartus, the Maxar imagery shows dozens of vehicles and other equipment clustered at the end of one of the piers. Again, this could point to impending plans to withdraw those forces. Vehicles and other equipment seen clustered at the end of a pier at Russia's Tartus naval base in Syria on December 17.

A Ropucha class landing ship was also seen departing the Baltic last week and the Ivan Gren, another amphibious warfare ship, may be headed in the same general direction.

'They have ceased flight operations over the country.' 'It appears to us that they're [the Russians] taking the steps that would be necessary if they were planning to retrograde their forces from there,' the official added. 'We don't know if they've reached the decision to do that, or if they are in discussions on whether they need to do that or not, but that force consolidation that would enable them to depart has certainly happened.' From 'a naval perspective, they have sent their fleet that was in Tartus out into the eastern Mediterranean,' the official continued. 'It’s not in port in Tartus, or wasn't the last time I looked. And so, again, it looks like they're setting conditions to depart. And as I mentioned, they have ceased military operations there as best we can tell.'

Izzettin Kasim/Anadolu via Getty Images Though there is no doubt that Russia is significantly drawing down its military presence in Syria, as the senior defense official noted, it still remains unclear whether it plans to withdraw from Khmeimim and Tartus for good. There continue to be reports that Russian authorities are negotiating with representatives of the new rebel-led transitional government about the future of the bases. Officials in Moscow have consistently insisted that no final decision on the status of the facilities has been made. There are also unconfirmed reports that the Russian military may have been ordered to leave entirely within a month and that the Kremlin could now be looking to expand its presence in Libya as an alternative. As The War Zone has continued to stress, being ejected from Khmeimim and Tartus would be a huge loss for the Kremlin with ramifications extending well beyond Syria. The Russians have poured significant resources into expanding these bases, which Assad had essentially gifted to them through a 49-year 'lease' deal in 2017. The facilities offer uniquely strategic locations to project air and naval power into the Mediterranean and Africa. Any talks the Russians are having with rebel authorities in Damascus now can only be complicated by Moscow's instrumental and active role in keeping Assad's brutal regime in power over the past decade or so. Russian forces were still striking the very same rebels just days before they ousted Assad. The Kremlin also says that it helped Assad flee the country and that they have granted him asylum. Assad has remained out of the public eye for more than a week now. A report today from Politico says that some members of the European Union are pushing the bloc to actively pressure Syria's new government to force out the Russians. French authorities re-raised the country's flag at the embassy in Damascus today, which had been shuttered for the past 12 years, in the latest sign of Western powers looking to reengage post-Assad.

This includes an Israeli campaign of strikes on former regime military assets and ground intervention in the south, as well as an offensive by Turkish-backed rebels against U.S.-backed Kurdish groups in the north. The U.S. military itself remains a major player in the country, as well. Earlier today, the head of the U.S.-backed predominantly Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) offered major concessions, including turning the city of Kaboni into a demilitarized zone, as part of a proposal to end fighting Turkish-supported groups. He suggested American forces could help enforce such an arrangement.

Gen. Patrick Ryder, the Pentagon's top spokesperson, said in response to a question from The War Zone's Howard Altman at a routine press conference today. 'I think we all have a vested interest in ensuring that groups in the region capitalize on the situation here to enable the people of Syria to be able to have a better life than they did under the Assad regime.

Secretive Bladed AGM-114R9X Hellfire Missile Looks To Have Reemer...	A new targeted strike involving the use of the secretive AGM-114R9X Hellfire missile looks to have occurred in northwestern Syria. The R9X variant features an array of six pop-out sword-like blades rather than a traditional high-explosive warhead. This comes amid a flurry of foreign strikes, including U.S. military ones targeting ISIS, across the Middle Eastern country where the airspace is now permissive following the fall of long-time dictator Bashar Al Assad. American officials have been open about their fears that terrorist groups could exploit the current situation. As yet unconfirmed reports say that three missiles in total were fired at a vehicle in Syria's Idlib region near the border with Turkey. Who may have been inside the vehicle and who the intended target or targets may have been are unknown. Pictures now circulating online do show what looks to be the blade arrays from at least two AGM-114R9Xs, as well as other distinctly Hellfire debris. A *Unknown drone* went after a high ranking person in Idlib (north of Armanaz; close to the Turkish borde) - as of now it is unknown who it is. The drone fired at least 3 R9X hellfire missiles (known as ninja missiles).

This version of the Hellfire was developed explicitly as a way to prosecute targeted strikes while minimizing the risk of collateral damage to an extreme degree. The bladed version of the Hellfire, also nicknamed the 'ninja bomb' and 'the flying Ginsu,' has also been employed in multiple targeted strikes against vehicles in northwestern Syria in the past. MQ-9 Reaper drones tied to the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) are also understood to be the launch platform of choice. In fact, the first known instance of the R9X's use was in a 2017 strike that killed Al Qaeda’s then-number two leader, Abu Khayr Al Masri, as he traveled by car in Idlib. The War Zone was the first to call attention to the clear use of a mysterious new munition in that case.

As noted, American authorities have made no secret of their concerns about the chaotic situation in Syria following the downfall of Assad, as well as the drawdown of Russian forces in the country, providing new space for terrorists to regroup. American forces have launched dozens of strikes targeting ISIS in the past week or so. As The War Zone has highlighted in the past, the collapse of the Syrian military, as well as the ongoing pullback of Russian forces, has substantially reduced risks to U.S. and other foreign aircraft operating over the country. Strikes in the western half of Syria, in particular, had previously been carried out only by drones and through the use of stand-off munitions. 'U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) forces conducted precision airstrikes targeting known ISIS camps and operatives in Syria, Dec. 16, killing 12 ISIS terrorists,' CENTCOM said in a statement just yesterday. 'The strikes against the ISIS leaders, operatives, and camps were conducted as part of the ongoing mission to disrupt, degrade, and defeat ISIS, preventing the terrorist group from conducting external operations and to ensure that ISIS does not seek opportunities to reconstitute in central Syria. These recent strikes are in former Regime and Russian controlled areas ensuring pressure is maintained on ISIS.'

The United States has also launched targeted strikes against members of other groups, including Hurras al-Din (Al Qaeda's current Syrian franchise) and Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), in that corner of the country in the past. HTS, which claimed to have broken from Al Qaeda in 2016, was at the forefront of the ouster of Assad and is now leading the effort to create a new government in Damascus. The U.S. government has confirmed it has been in contact with HTS since the fall of the Assad regime, despite it, along with others, still officially designating the group as terrorists. The apparent R9X strike also underscores the ongoing fluidity of the situation throughout Syria and the sheer number of actors, internal and external, who remain very actively involved. Israeli and Turkish forces have been carrying out their own strikes across the country in pursuit of their own national security aims. Israel has been focused on preventing former Assad regime military assets from being used by other groups, while Turkey has been targeting Kurdish groups in the north, including U.S.-backed forces. Those countries have also been taking advantage of the newly permissive airspace above Syria. U.S. strikes in Syria, whether they involve R9Xs or not, as well as those by other foreign powers, only look set to continue amid the ongoing power vacuum in the country.

Multiple Drone Incursions Confirmed Over Marine Corps Base Camp P...	Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton in southern California experienced multiple drone incursions over its airspace over the past several days, a facility spokesman told The War Zone on Tuesday morning. Between Dec. 9 and 15, 'there were six instances of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) observed entering Camp Pendleton’s airspace, with no threat to installation operations,' Capt James C. Sartain, a base spokesman, told The War Zone in response to our query on the matter. Sartain could not immediately provide details about how many drones flew over the installation, their origin, what actions were taken in response and if any air or ground operations were affected as a result of the incursions. We have asked for these details and will update this story should any be provided. Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton Located in north San Diego County, MCB Camp Pendleton is the Marine Corps’ major west coast training facility. It is home to the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, 1st Marine Division, 1st Marine Logistics Group, elements of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, and several other tenant units including Marine Corps Air Station Camp Pendleton, ACU-5, Naval Hospital, the Marine Corps Tactical Systems Support Activity (MCTSSA), Weapons Field Training Battalion, Naval Weapons Station Fallbrook, and the Deployment Processing Command Reserve Support Unit - West). A map of the sprawling Camp Pendleton facility located on the SoCal coast. (USMC) This is just the latest in a growing string over incursions reported over U.S. military installations at home and abroad. News about MCB Camp Pendleton follows a drone incursion over Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio forcing the closure of its airspace Friday night into Saturday morning. The War Zone was the first to report that incident. On Tuesday, Wright-Patterson officials announced that there were additional incursions over the facility. 'Small unmanned aerial systems were spotted in the vicinity of and over Wright-Patterson AFB’s Area A and Area B during the late evening and early morning of Dec. 16 and Dec. 17th,' the 88th Air Base Wing said in a statement. 'Installation leaders have determined that none of the incursions impacted base residents, facilities or assets. The Wright-Patterson AFB airspace was not affected by the incursions.' 'The number of systems has fluctuated, and they have ranged in sizes and configurations,' the release added. 'Our units continue to monitor the airspace and are working with local law enforcement authorities and mission partners to ensure the safety of base personnel, facilities and assets. We request individuals in the area to contact either local police or Security Forces if they see anything suspicious, to include sUAS's or drone activity.' The sprawling Wright-Patterson AFB complex. (Google Earth) This all comes amid a growing frenzy about drones that began when they appeared over Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey on Nov. 18, which we were the first to report. Since then, the FBI said more than 5,000 reports of drone sightings came into its drone hotline, of which fewer than 100 merited further investigation. On Monday night, the Pentagon, FBI and Department of Homeland Security issued a statement that they have 'not identified anything anomalous and do not assess the activity to date to present a national security or public safety risk over the civilian airspace in New Jersey or other states in the northeast.' The full statement is below: 'There are more than one million drones lawfully registered with the FAA in the United States and there are thousands of commercial, hobbyist and law enforcement drones lawfully in the sky on any given day. With the technology landscape evolving, we expect that number to increase over time. FBI has received tips of more than 5,000 reported drone sightings in the last few weeks with approximately 100 leads generated, and the federal government is supporting state and local officials in investigating these reports. Consistent with each of our unique missions and authorities, we are quickly working to prioritize and follow these leads. We have sent advanced detection technology to the region. And we have sent trained visual observers. Having closely examined the technical data and tips from concerned citizens, we assess that the sightings to date include a combination of lawful commercial drones, hobbyist drones, and law enforcement drones, as well as manned fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and stars mistakenly reported as drones. We have not identified anything anomalous and do not assess the activity to date to present a national security or public safety risk over the civilian airspace in New Jersey or other states in the northeast. That said, we recognize the concern among many communities. We continue to support state and local authorities with advanced detection technology and support of law enforcement. We urge Congress to enact counter-UAS legislation when it reconvenes that would extend and expand existing counter-drone authorities to identify and mitigate any threat that may emerge. Additionally, there have been a limited number of visual sightings of drones over military facilities in New Jersey and elsewhere, including within restricted air space. Such sightings near or over DoD installations are not new. DoD takes unauthorized access over its airspace seriously and coordinates closely with federal, state, and local law enforcement authorities, as appropriate. Local commanders are actively engaged to ensure there are appropriate detection and mitigation measures in place.' DHS, @FBI, @FAANews, and the @DeptofDefense released the following joint statement on the ongoing response to reported drone sightings. pic.twitter.com/ihGcGbjOEy&mdash; Homeland Security (@DHSgov) December 17, 2024 However, public furor has become so concerning that the FBI and New Jersey State Police last night issued a plea for people to not fire lasers or bullets at anything in the sky. 'We are seeing an increase of pilots of manned aircraft being hit in the eyes with lasers as people on the ground think they see a drone,' cautioned Nelson Delgado, the Acting Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Newark Field Office, which is leading the drone investigation. 'We are also concerned that people will take matters into their own hands and fire a weapon at an aircraft. Not only is this act against the law, but it poses an incredible danger to the pilots and passengers on those aircraft.' 'Whatever your beliefs are,' Delgado added, 'putting someone else's life in danger is not the answer.' pic.twitter.com/ELgIo1gnOt&mdash; FBI Newark (@FBINewark) December 16, 2024 The FBI warning came after pilots of 15 fixed and rotary wing aircraft from Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst reported being struck by lasers from the ground since Dec. 7, Capt. Kitsana R. Douglomachan told The War Zone. One of those pilots had to seek medical treatment but was quickly released. All aircraft landed safely, he said, adding that officials do not know who fired the lasers. NJ.com was the first to report these incidents. Monday night, Hill Air Force Base became the latest installation experiencing drone incursions. 'We can confirm that unmanned aerial systems were spotted in the vicinity of Hill AFB recently,' a spokesperson told KUTV-2 news Monday night. 'To date, unmanned aerial systems have not impacted Hill AFB operations and all appropriate measures are being taken to safeguard Hill AFB personnel, assets, and infrastructure.' An amazing elephant walk of F-35s at Hill Air Force Base. USAF U.S. officials are still trying to discover the origin of drones that appeared over four U.S. Air Force bases in the U.K., another story we first broke. They’ve been spotted over RAF Lakenheath, RAF Mildenhall, and RAF Feltwell, all within close proximity, and RAF Fairford, about 130 miles to the west. A few days earlier, Ramstein Air Base in Germany joined the growing list of places registering unknown drone overflights. TWZ has been on the leading edge of covering this topic for years and has broken multiple stories now about drone incursions over key U.S. bases and training ranges, as well as uncrewed aerial systems, harassing American forces off the coasts of the United States and making worrisome overflights of important non-military sites. A spate of drone incursions over Langley Air Force Base in Virginia in December 2023, which TWZ was the first report on, has now become a particular focal point of concern about these instances. While authorities are downplaying the majority of public drone sightings, they acknowledge a real concern about those flying over military installations, which as we have noted, forced the closure of airspace over one of those facilities.

Russian General Accused Of Using Chemical Weapons Assassinated By...	The Security Service of Ukraine has claimed responsibility for the assassination of a Russian general, the most high-profile killing of its kind since the start of the Kremlin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, the commander of Russia’s radiation, chemical, and biological defense troops, known as the RKhBZ, was killed in an explosion, along with his assistant, in Moscow early this morning, a day after Ukrainian state prosecutors charged him in absentia with the alleged use of banned chemical weapons. Sources within the Security Service of Ukraine, or SBU, told various news agencies that the killings were a 'special operation' by the organization. 'The liquidation of Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, chief of the Russian Armed Forces’ radiation, chemical, and biological defense troops is a special operation by the SBU,' one source told AFP. A view of the scene after Lt. Gen.

'We were involved in the operation,' the source said. Kirillov and his assistant were killed outside a Moscow apartment, when a bomb hidden in an electric scooter went off, according to Russia’s Investigative Committee, which probes serious crimes. It appears that the explosives were detonated remotely as the two individuals entered a house on Moscow’s Ryazansky Prospekt, around four miles southeast of the Kremlin.

Kirillov had been listed on the Ukrainian Myrotvorets (Peacemaker) website, an unofficial database of people considered to be enemies of the country. As of this morning, a photograph of Kirillov on the website had the word 'Liquidated' overwritten in red letters. While other senior members of the Russian Armed Forces as well as civic and industry leaders, and pro-Kremlin figures, have been targeted in assassination attempts, especially in Crimea and Russian-occupied areas elsewhere in Ukraine, this incident is especially notable. Not only was Kirillov, who was 54, the most senior Russian military officer to be assassinated inside Russia by Ukraine, but authorities in Kyiv immediately claimed responsibility for the action. Previously, such targeted killings have often been left unclaimed. A view of the scene after the explosion outside a house on Moscow’s Ryazansky Prospekt, Moscow, on December 17, 2024. Photo by Sefa Karacan/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, now the deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, has said that Moscow will avenge the killing, threatening Ukraine’s military and political leadership with an unspecified imminent response, according to the state-run RIA news agency. 'Realizing the inevitability of its military defeat, [Ukraine] launches cowardly and despicable strikes in peaceful cities,' Medvedev added, according to RIA. As for the RKhBZ, the role of this organization is often misunderstood in the West. Officially known as the Troops of Radiological, Chemical, and Biological Defense of the Russian Armed Forces, its primary task is to provide protection for Russian military units, allowing them to fight in conditions of nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) contamination. In addition, the RKhBZ is tasked to enhance the survivability of the Russian Armed Forces against other weapons on the battlefield, for example by laying smokescreens. Traditionally, the RKhBZ has also been responsible for the Russian Ground Forces’ TOS-1A, a multiple-launch rocket system (MLRS) that fires a thermobaric rocket payload. Soldiers of an RKhBZ unit from the Russian Western Military District decontaminate a BTR-82A armored personnel carrier during a training camp run by the 20th Guards Army. Russian Ministry of Defense Of course, the RKhBZ would be involved in protecting Russian troops both against the NBC contaminants that they use, as well as those deployed by a potential enemy. Accordingly, Ukrainian prosecutors charged Kirillov in absentia with the use of banned chemical weapons in Ukraine, only yesterday. According to the SBU, there have been more than 4,800 cases of such weapons being used by Russia since the start of the full-scale invasion, leading to over 2,000 Ukrainian service members having been hospitalized. In May of this year, the U.S. State Department determined that Russian forces had used chloropicrin — a toxic choking agent that has a disorientating effect — in Ukraine. This was 'probably driven by Russian forces’ desire to dislodge Ukrainian forces from fortified positions and achieve tactical gains on the battlefield,' the State Department concluded. A World War II poster describes the effects of chlorpicrin for the benefit of U.S. servicemen. National Museum of Health and Medicine As we have discussed in the past, the exact definition of what constitutes a chemical weapon is complicated. However, chloropicrin is classified as a choking agent by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and its battlefield use is expressly banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which Russia also signed. In October, the United Kingdom put sanctions on Kirillov and the RKhBZ, in response to Russian forces’ use of chemical agents on the battlefield. Russia has denied having used chemical weapons. Meanwhile, Russian claims also extend the blame for such violations to Kyiv’s Western allies, although no independently verified evidence of this has ever been presented. Kirillov was also part of Russia’s attempts to rebuff Ukrainian claims that it had used chemical weapons in Ukraine. He appeared in the past on Russian state TV giving briefings, in which he accused Ukraine of violating nuclear safety protocols as well as implicating the West in various alleged crimes.

While Kirillov might well be the most senior Russian Armed Forces figure to have been assassinated since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, there has been a series of high-profile killings, targeting, in particular, those who Kyiv considers guilty of war crimes. In 2022, Darya Dugina, the daughter of the Kremlin-linked far-right ideologue Alexander Dugin, was killed by a car bomb in the Moscow region. In 2023, pro-war blogger Vladlen Tatarsky was killed when the St. Petersburg cafe he was in was bombed. Tatarsky, who was born in the Donbas region of Ukraine, and had fought with pro-Russian separatist forces, had become one of Russia’s most outspoken and ultranationalist military bloggers.

While Ukrainian authorities do not claim responsibility for all such assassinations, they have said that targeted killings are a legitimate tool in the war with Russia. Russian promises of revenge for Kirillov’s killing are nothing new, of course, but the high-profile nature of this latest assassination may prompt other reactions from the Kremlin. After all, the killing will likely have sent shock waves through the Russian Armed Forces leadership, in particular, raising questions about the safety of its senior officers even on the relative safety of home soil. A review of security protocols for leading Russian military personnel would seem to be an immediate priority. 'The killing of a lieutenant general will be a shock for many,' a former senior Russian defense official told The Guardian, speaking on conditions of anonymity. 'This will definitely cause a stir,' the former official added. Bolstering the security details assigned to figures like Kirillov would be one obvious response. However, relevant units of the Russian Armed Forces and internal security forces are already heavily engaged in Ukraine, with an ever-present threat of assassinations and sabotage in Russian-occupied areas. For now, the assassination of Kirillov appears to be a win for Ukraine, which will see his elimination as justice for his involvement in the alleged use of banned chemical weapons. It is also perhaps the most powerful signal so far of the potential vulnerability of even the highest-ranking Russian military officers, wherever they might be. At the same time, it could result in a renewed focus by the Kremlin in targeting Ukrainian leadership.

Russian General Accused Of Using Chemical Weapons Assassinated By...	The Security Service of Ukraine has claimed responsibility for the assassination of a Russian general, the most high-profile killing of its kind since the start of the Kremlin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, the commander of Russia’s radiation, chemical, and biological defense troops, known as the RKhBZ, was killed in an explosion, along with his assistant, in Moscow early this morning, a day after Ukrainian state prosecutors charged him in absentia with the alleged use of banned chemical weapons. Sources within the Security Service of Ukraine, or SBU, told various news agencies that the killings were a 'special operation' by the organization. 'The liquidation of Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, chief of the Russian Armed Forces’ radiation, chemical, and biological defense troops is a special operation by the SBU,' one source told AFP. A view of the scene after Lt. Gen.

'We were involved in the operation,' the source said. Kirillov and his assistant were killed outside a Moscow apartment, when a bomb hidden in an electric scooter went off, according to Russia’s Investigative Committee, which probes serious crimes. It appears that the explosives were detonated remotely as the two individuals entered a house on Moscow’s Ryazansky Prospekt, around four miles southeast of the Kremlin.

Kirillov had been listed on the Ukrainian Myrotvorets (Peacemaker) website, an unofficial database of people considered to be enemies of the country. As of this morning, a photograph of Kirillov on the website had the word 'Liquidated' overwritten in red letters. While other senior members of the Russian Armed Forces as well as civic and industry leaders, and pro-Kremlin figures, have been targeted in assassination attempts, especially in Crimea and Russian-occupied areas elsewhere in Ukraine, this incident is especially notable. Not only was Kirillov, who was 54, the most senior Russian military officer to be assassinated inside Russia by Ukraine, but authorities in Kyiv immediately claimed responsibility for the action. Previously, such targeted killings have often been left unclaimed. A view of the scene after the explosion outside a house on Moscow’s Ryazansky Prospekt, Moscow, on December 17, 2024. Photo by Sefa Karacan/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, now the deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, has said that Moscow will avenge the killing, threatening Ukraine’s military and political leadership with an unspecified imminent response, according to the state-run RIA news agency. 'Realizing the inevitability of its military defeat, [Ukraine] launches cowardly and despicable strikes in peaceful cities,' Medvedev added, according to RIA. As for the RKhBZ, the role of this organization is often misunderstood in the West. Officially known as the Troops of Radiological, Chemical, and Biological Defense of the Russian Armed Forces, its primary task is to provide protection for Russian military units, allowing them to fight in conditions of nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) contamination. In addition, the RKhBZ is tasked to enhance the survivability of the Russian Armed Forces against other weapons on the battlefield, for example by laying smokescreens. Traditionally, the RKhBZ has also been responsible for the Russian Ground Forces’ TOS-1A, a multiple-launch rocket system (MLRS) that fires a thermobaric rocket payload.

The Mystery Of The Syrian IL-76 Cargo Jet That Went Missing As As...	There is growing, but still circumstantial evidence that a Syrian Airlines Il-76 Candid cargo plane currently at Russia's Khmeimim Air Base in Syria is one that appeared to go missing in the final chaotic moments of Bashar Al Assad's regime. Rumors and claims swirled that the aircraft had been carrying Assad and was shot down after it disappeared from online flight tracking sites. The Syrian dictator fled the capital Damascus for Khmeimim, and then to Moscow, according to the first statement attributed to him in more than a week that was put out earlier today. A Syrian Airlines Il-76 is seen at Khmeimim Air Base on December 15, 2024. Izzettin Kasim/Anadolu via Getty Images The statement said to have been from Assad was posted through a channel on the Telegram social media network linked to the now-defunct Syrian regime earlier today, but it is unclear whether or not he actually drafted it and/or put it online. The deposed Syrian dictator has not been seen publicly in more than a week, despite Russian officials saying they have offered him asylum. You can read more about the overall current situation in Syria, which remains very fluid, in our past reporting here. Assad relocated to Khmeimim via unspecified means and with Russia's assistance on December 8, according to the statement. It also claims the Syrian strongman had initially intended to continue commanding the fight against rebel forces from the Russian base. So far there is no independent corroboration of this assertion. The War Zone has noted in the past that the Russian air base would be the safest place in the country for Assad in a crisis. 'With no viable means of leaving the base, Moscow requested that the base's command arrange an immediate evacuation to Russia on the evening of Sunday 8th December,' the statement adds. 'This took place a day after the fall of Damascus, following the collapse of the final military positions and the resulting paralysis of all remaining state institutions.' The basic timeline outlined in the statement aligns with online flight tracking data that showed a Syrian Airlines Il-76 with the Syrian registration YK-ATA fly north from the Damascus area early on December 8. The tracking data for that flight cut out just after it passed the city of Homs, which rebel forces had taken control of on December 7. That, combined with data showing a pronounced left turn and a precipitous drop in speed and altitude, all the way down to 1,625 feet and 130 knots, had quickly sparked rumors that the aircraft had been shot down.

The War Zone has been working to obtain high-resolution imagery of this location, but we have not received a clear picture yet. No imagery has otherwise emerged to date showing any apparent Il-76 wreckage in Syria.

'With that in mind, analyzing the raw ADS-B data received from YK-ATA shows positional and speed data that strains credulity.' It's also worth noting here that YK-ATA's trip north was unusual, to begin with, based on flight tracking data from ADS-B Exchange that The War Zone reviewed. In the months leading up to Assad's fall, the plane was very active, but was observed flying routes to and from locations in Africa. Flightradar24's December 12 blog post also says that 'in recent months the aircraft has visited Benghazi, Libya on a regular basis.' There are now reports that Russia may be looking to make any losses to its presence in Syria by expanding its posture in Libya, though there are no indications that is tied to YK-ATA recent flight history. An example of a typical flight track for YK-ATA in the months leading up to the fall of Assad's regime. This particular flight occurred on December 3. ADS-B Exchange Furthermore, it has now been confirmed that a Syrian Airlines Il-76 is parked in one corner of an open apron at the northeast end of Khmeimim. Satellite imagery The War Zone has reviewed from Planet Labs show the Candid at its current position by December 9. An Il-76 was seen parked between the runways the day before and was not there on December 7. A Syrian Airlines Yak-40, a passenger plane that is between a large business jet and a small airliner size-wise, also appeared at the base on December 8. The Yak-40 was initially parked on a different apron, but was moved next to the Il-76 by December 13. The video in the social media post below, which was taken via a drone and that Turkey-based Syria TV put out last week, clearly shows a Syrian Airlines Il-76 at Khmeimim at multiple points in its runtime.

The Il-76 could have been used to help spirit other assets, including regime riches, to Khmeimim and then out of the country. It would have been a top priority for Assad to get physical assets, including gold and currency reserves, to a safe place. The Assad family has already been reportedly squirreling away vast wealth overseas for years. There are reports that other former regime officials have been fleeing to the Russian base in order to get out of the country with the Kremlin's help, as well. However, it remains unknown for sure whether or not it is YK-ATA at the Russian base. Syrian Airlines has four Il-76s in its inventory and no imagery has emerged so far clearly showing the registration on the example at Khmeimim. There is still a possibility that YK-ATA went elsewhere or came down. Questions very much remain about what might happen to the Khmeimim Air Base, including the Syrian Airlines aircraft there, as well as Russia's naval base at Tartus. The air and naval facilities are highly strategic facilities for the Kremlin that support operations beyond Syria. A substantial withdrawal of Russian forces from the country is underway, but it remains unclear whether or not they are leaving for good. Russian officials insist that they are still trying to hold on to their two prized bases, but there are unconfirmed reports that they could be ordered to vacate the country within a month. You can read more about what is known now about these deliberations in reporting here. The end of Assad's regime has already provided the opportunity for unprecedented views of Khmeimim. Maybe now clearer imagery will emerge showing the Syrian Airlines Il-76's registration code to settle the question of whether this is the 'missing' jet for good.

North Korean Troops Launched Large-Scale Combat Operations In Kur...	North Korean troops began conducting large-scale assault operations against Ukrainian forces in Russia’s Kursk region last week, the head of the Ukrainian Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR) told The War Zone on Monday. That timeline was later confirmed by the Pentagon. While there have been about 12,000 North Koreans in Kursk for months to help Russia push back the Ukrainian invasion there, they only recently began to attack in larger numbers, Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov told us. His comments followed those by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who on Saturday said that 'the Russians have begun to use North Korean soldiers in their assaults—a significant number of them. The Russians include them in combined units and use them in operations in the Kursk region. So far, only there. But we have information suggesting their use could extend to other parts of the frontline. There are also already noticeable losses in this category.'

The Russians are including them in… pic.twitter.com/eN9NRsdE9J&mdash; NOELREPORTS (@NOELreports) December 14, 2024 So far, North Korea has suffered more than 200 casualties in those operations, GUR said on Telegram. One of their positions in Kursk was 'effectively covered' by first-person view (FPV) drones. Pyongyang’s forces, as we previously noted, have already been killed in Ukraine, but on a much smaller scale.

'Language barrier remains a difficult obstacle to management and coordination of actions,' GUR explained. As a result, North Korean soldiers fired on vehicles belonging to the Akhmat battalion of Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov. At least eight of those fighters were killed in the incident, GUR claimed. On Saturday and Sunday, at least 30 North Koreans were killed or wounded in fighting near three villages - Matrynovka on the easternmost portion of the Ukrainian salient, Plekhovo in a contested area about 10 miles to the south, and Vorobzha, which is about nine miles to the southeast in Russian-held territory. The War Zone cannot independently verify Ukraine's casualty claims. The North Koreans suffered losses fighting near Martynovka in Russia's Kursk Oblast, Ukraine claims. Google Earth image 'Due to losses, the assault groups are being replenished with fresh personnel, in particular from the 94th separate brigade of the DPRK army, to continue active combat operations in the area,' GUR explained, using the official Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) acronym for North Korea. The Pentagon’s top spokesman on Monday confirmed GUR's claim that the North Koreans are now fighting alongside Russians. They entered combat alongside Russian troops 'about a week ago,' Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters at a Pentagon briefing. 'We do have indications that they have separate casualties, both killed and wounded,' he said. 'I don't have specific numbers to provide for you, but that is obviously something that we continue to monitor. And as we've said all along, those forces are legitimate military targets for the Ukrainians, given that they are engaged in active combat.' North Korean and Russian troops are now fighting together in Kursk officials say. (Via Twitter) Via Twitter After launching the Kursk invasion in August, Ukraine captured about 500 square miles of what was initially lightly defended territory. Russia has since mounted two counter-operations, including one in September that saw upwards of 60,000 troops recapture about half of what it had lost by the end of November. Since then, there haven’t been any major territorial gains or losses by either side as the fight has bogged down in the frigid December weather. Having 12,000 North Koreans in the mix is certainly a boon for Russia, even with language and command and control issues. As we have noted before, as Moscow and Pyongyang continue to cement their relationship, many more troops could be on the way given that manpower is North Korea's greatest resource. There are many other facets to this relationship. In addition to potentially receiving air defense systems and energy supplies from Russia in exchange for the troops in Kursk and assorted weaponry, including millions of artillery shells, North Korea is reportedly going to receive fighter aircraft as well. Russian Su-27 (Dmitry A. Mottl/Wikimedia Commons) There have also been concerns that Moscow might provide North Korea with technologies to help accelerate its nuclear and long-range ballistic missile programs. Russia would also be a prime candidate to assist North Korea in pushing forward its submarine program, which also includes a growing family of submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) as well as increasingly advanced submarine technologies. PHOTO BY VLADIMIR SMIRNOV/POOL/AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES On Monday, the Foreign Ministers of Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the High Representative of the European Union issued a joint statement condemning the burgeoning North Korea-Russia relationship. Those nations also raised concerns that this is inflaming tensions on the Korean peninsula. 'Direct DPRK support for Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine marks a dangerous expansion of the conflict, with serious consequences for European and Indo-Pacific security,' the statement read in part. 'The DPRK’s export of ballistic missiles, artillery shells, and other military materiel to Russia for use against Ukraine and Russia’s training of DPRK soldiers involving arms or related materiel represent flagrant violations of United Nations Security Council resolutions 1718 (2006), 1874 (2009), and 2270 (2016). We are deeply concerned about any political, military, or economic support that Russia may be providing to the DPRK’s illegal weapons programs, including weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery, which would exacerbate the already tense environment on the Korean Peninsula.' Ukraine's investment in Kursk comes as it continues to lose ground in the eastern part of its own country. As we have continuously highlighted in the past, Kursk is a bargaining chip. With Donald Trump set to return to the White House on Jan. 20, both sides are trying to grab as much territory as possible ahead of any future peace negotiations or any plan implemented by the new administration. The Latest Elsewhere on the battlefield, Russia continues to make gains in the east, particularly in Donetsk Oblast. Their push toward Pokrovsk continues but has yet to succeed. These are the key takeaways from the latest Institute for the Study of War assessment. Russian forces conducted a roughly battalion-sized mechanized assault in the Siversk direction following a recent reported command change of the Russian forces operating near Siversk. The recent Siversk assault indicates that Russian forces appear to be learning to conduct more effective assaults but remain far from restoring maneuver to the battlefield. North Korean forces are reportedly facing expected struggles with high casualties and poor communication with Russian forces in Kursk Oblast, likely disrupting coordination between North Korean and Russian personnel and undermining Russian military operations. Russian forces recently advanced near Siversk, Toretsk, Pokrovsk, and Vuhledar.

The sniper 'was actually on the same terrain level with the Russian occupier, aimed in the harsh Ukrainian December, fired while standing in a trench at the enemy, who was moving in a landing - and hit with the first shot,' GUR stated on its website. '‘In the conditions of modern warfare, you do not have the opportunity to climb out of a trench, lie down in a landing, etc. Enemy drones do not allow you to shoot from classic positions,’' the scout explained.' The shot was 'a masterful job that will definitely go down in the history of our struggle for freedom,' Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov said in a statement on the GUR website. 'Hitting a moving target at such a distance is a huge achievement; evidence of high professionalism and concentration, which snipers of Ukrainian military intelligence are famous for. We continue the fight to destroy even more Russian occupiers!' To make the shot, Lecturer said he fired a .338 Lapua Magnum (8.6mm) round from a Sako TRG M10 sniper rifle. 'But if I had a choice: to choose one rifle and one cartridge, I would take the Cadex Kraken and the .338LM caliber,' noted 'Lecturer.' The confirmed record for this caliber belongs to the British sniper, Corporal of the Royal Guards Regiment 'Blues and Royals' Craig Harrison.

Future Of Russia’s Bases In Syria Remains In Flux, Libya Possible...	While the Russian military continues to withdraw equipment and troops from Syria, Israel has continued its air raids, intended to further degrade what is left of the former Syrian Armed Forces’ fighting capacity. Israel bombarded Syria overnight with what was described by a U.K.-based war monitor group as 'the heaviest strikes' in the area in more than a decade. Meanwhile, there are varied reports suggesting that Russian forces might vacate Syria within days, or within a month, although officials on both sides have stressed that negotiations are ongoing. Overnight Israeli strikes on the Syrian coastal Tartus region targeted various sites including air defense units and surface-to-surface missile depots, according to the war monitor group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The same group said these were 'the heaviest strikes in Syria’s coastal region since the start of strikes in 2012.'

Photo by Bakr ALKASEM / AFP BAKR ALKASEM Outside of the Tartus region, Israel is also reported to have targeted missile launchers in the Hama area and radars at the military air base at Deir ez-Zor. The ongoing campaign of Israeli strikes is designed to destroy regime weapons stockpiles to prevent them from falling into the hands of Islamist groups. Last week, the Israeli military said it had conducted 350 strikes in Syria, destroying 80 percent of the strategic military capabilities left behind by the Bashar al-Assad regime. The Israeli bombardment has led to protests from the new Syrian administration, led by a rebel coalition. The administration has also lodged a complaint with the U.N. Security Council about Israeli incursions into Syrian territory in the Golan Heights. Israeli troops and military vehicles cross in and out of Syria through a gate in the boundary fence near the Druze village of Majdal Shams on the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights, on December 15, 2024. Photo by Mati Milstein/NurPhoto via Getty Images Mati Milstein Mohammed al-Jolani, the leader of the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) Islamist group that led the offensive against the Assad regime, said the Israeli strikes 'crossed red lines' but conceded that Syria was in no fit state to seek further conflict. 'Syria’s war-weary condition, after years of conflict and war, does not allow for new confrontations. The priority at this stage is reconstruction and stability, not being drawn into disputes that could lead to further destruction,' Jolani said in an interview with Syria TV. Some more details have come to light on Assad’s rapid departure from Syria earlier this month. In a statement published on the Syrian presidency’s Telegram channel, Assad claimed he left Russia's Khmeimim Air Base for Moscow on December 8. He claims that he was evacuated from the air base as it came under drone attack, having left Damascus the same morning as opposition fighters closed in on the capital. The comment was Assad’s first in public since he was toppled from power by the rebel offensive. Recent activity at Khmeimim Air Base and the Russian naval base at Tartus, in satellite imagery. PHOTO © 2024 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Having propped up the Assad regime, Russia is continuing to withdraw military equipment and troops from Syria. TWZ has already reported on apparent Russian evacuations from Khmeimim Air Base in Syria. These movements have now been confirmed by different Western officials — including two from the United States. However, those same officials, speaking to CNN, described the Russian withdrawal as 'large-scale and significant,' but said it was unclear if the evacuation would be permanent. With HTS now effectively in control in Syria, the fate of the Russian facilities — including Khmeimim Air Base and the naval base at Tartus — will be dependent on some kind of negotiated settlement between the rebel group and Moscow.

At the same time, an aerostat has also appeared over the base, to provide additional surveillance.

Photo by Izzettin Kasim/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu Other recent aircraft movements have involved the evacuation of Russian diplomatic personnel in Damascus as well as Belarusian and North Korean diplomats, using Russian Air Force flights out of Khmeimim. 'We don’t feel unsafe, we are hoping to make friendly relations with the new government as soon as it becomes a legitimate government,' a representative of the Russian military at Khmeimim told The Guardian today, in a rare interview. 'Neither side is making provocations and things have been fine,' the Russian military representative added. There is also now growing evidence of Libya’s support for the Russian military exodus from Syria. At least some of the Russian naval assets have been moved from Tartus to Libya, while there are reports that Moscow is stepping up pressure on Libyan National Army commander Khalifa Haftar to allow Russia access to a port in Benghazi. This would provide Russia with an alternative naval installation on the Mediterranean, the importance of which we have discussed in the past. At least one Syrian-registered Il-76 Candid airlifter has also been noted in recent days operating between Syria and Libya, and other locations in Africa. Should Russia end up leaving Syria altogether, Libya could well provide an alternative hub for the Russian military to provide access to the Mediterranean and as a transshipment point for other Russian interests in Africa. Officially, at least, Russia says it’s still to decide on the fate of its military bases in Syria. The Kremlin today said it was in contact with those in charge of the country.

This was confirmed today by Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder. Among the key systems that have departed are S-400 long-range surface-to-air missile systems previously based at Khmeimim. 'One of the big factors that has changed in Syria is the airspace, in the sense that previously you had Syrian regime and Russian air defenses, which would preclude in many cases our ability or desirability to go into those areas' to conduct anti-ISIS operations, Ryder told reporters. 'It is a much more permissible environment now, in that regard.' Since the fall of the Assad regime, the U.S. military has flown several rounds of airstrikes targeting ISIS camps and operatives in Syria. For now, it remains to be seen what kind of presence the Russian military will have in Syria longer-term. These are very much still early days in a tentative relationship being established between Moscow and the new administration in Syria; after all, Russian forces bombed HTS and other rebel groups, as well as much of the Syrian population for nearly a decade. However, should basing options in Syria fall through, it may be the case that Libya is on hand to provide some alternatives for the Russian military to retain its presence in the region.

China Launches Hypersonic Test Planes From Drones, Balloons	A video and pictures have emerged showing testing of Chinese high-flying and high-speed uncrewed air vehicles, including aerial releases from a TB-001 drone and a high-altitude balloon. The air vehicle designs are related to the MD-22, ostensibly a hypersonic testbed, which first broke cover two years ago. The bulk of the new imagery comes from the video clip seen in the social media post below. Additional pictures have also appeared online. A machine translation of the audio accompanying the footage shows an apparent focus on the life and inspiration of Qian Xuesen, rather than the MD-series vehicles. Qian did pioneering aerospace work in the United States, including co-founding NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, before being caught up in the Red Scares of the 1950s. He was subsequently placed under partial house arrest before being deported to China, where he became instrumental in the country's ballistic missile and space programs. 中国临近空间宽域飞行器研制试验首次公开披露！ pic.twitter.com/mLkCQQ5zX1&mdash; DS北风（风哥） (@WenJian0922) December 16, 2024 Still, the video does offer very interesting new looks and insights into the MD-22-related air vehicles. Examples are seen marked MD-19 and MD-21, as well as one where only 'MD-2' is visible. The MD-19 sports the logos of the Institute of Mechanics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (IMCAS) and CAS itself on the rear left side of its central fuselage. The development team behind the MD-22 includes IMCAS, as well as the Guangdong Aerodynamic Research Academy (GARA). IMCAS and CAS logos, as well as a read hexagon and illegible writing, are seen here at the rear of the left side of the MD-19's fuselage. Chinese Internet via X An air vehicle marked MD-21 is seen here in the background. Chinese Internet via X Only 'MD-2' is visible marked on the side of this air vehicle. Chinese Internet via X In the video, the MD-19, MD-21, and 'MD-2' all look to have the same general overall layout as the MD-22 with its wedge-shaped main fuselage, delta wings, and twin canted vertical tails. The MD-19 has retractable tricycle landing gear, a feature also depicted on the mockup of the MD-22 that first broke cover at the Zhuhai Airshow in 2022. The MD-22 design has been stated to be close to 35.5 feet (10.8 meters) long, had a wingspan of nearly 15 feet (4.5 meters), an empty weight of one ton, a maximum takeoff weight of four tons, a peak speed of Mach 7, and a maximum range of 4,970 miles (8,000 kilometers). The War Zone noted at the time that the range figure seemed, at best, highly aspirational and could reflect further iterations or evolutions of the design under development. A mock-up of the MD-22 on display the Zhuhai Airshow in 2022. Chinese Internet What kind of propulsion systems the MD-22 or any of these related vehicles use remains unclear. However, the new imagery further points to the core design being based around a single air-breathing main engine, possibly flanked by a pair of rocket motors. This, in turn, could indicate the use or planned use of advanced high-speed engines like dual-mode ramjets or scramjets, which do not work effectively at subsonic speeds. Platforms that use those engines therefore require some kind of initial boost, typically from one or more rocket motors. Aerodynamic fairings are seen in place at the rear of the MD-19 and 'MD-2' vehicles in the newly emerged imagery, which could break away when the various engines/motors start. A look at the rear of one of the MD-series vehicles after its release from a high-altitude balloon, showing three openings at the rear. Chinese Internet via X Another view of the MD-19 after its release from a TB-001 drone showing three aerodynamic fairings, one larger than the other two, in place at the rear. Chinese Internet via X The video and other images show the MD-19 being released from a TB-001 drone and then landing on a traditional runway. Whether this was a powered flight test or if the vehicle glided back down to Earth is unclear. The MD-19 also looks to be between one-third and one-quarter of the length of the nearly 33-feet-long (10-meter-long) TB-001, or between roughly eight and 11 feet (2.5 and 3.35 meters). This is notably shorter than the MD-22. A view of the MD-19 being released from the TB-001. Chinese Internet via X A low-resolution view of the TB-001 with the MD-19 under its wing. Chinese Internet via X Tengden's TB-001 is a now well-established design, versions of which are in operational service with China's People's Liberation Army (PLA). Though the TB-001 has been shown with various weapons and other stores loaded on pylons under its wings in the past, this appears to be the first time it has been seen launching another uncrewed platform of any kind in flight. A stock image of a TB-001 with various munitions, or mock-ups thereof, under its wings. VCG/VCG via Getty Images The newly emerged footage separately shows the 'MD-2' vehicle, which also appears to be smaller than the MD-22, being loaded into a payload adapter, which is then carried aloft by a high-altitude balloon and released. It's unclear if the vehicle's subsequent flight was powered at any point and how or if it was recovered afterward. China actively uses high-altitude balloons for various research and development and test and evaluation activities, as well as intelligence-gathering purposes and other military purposes. This includes past hypersonic testing, as well as use as aerial launch platforms for drone swarms and other payloads with a clear eye to future operational capabilities as The War Zone has previously explored in depth. Screen captures from the video showing the 'MD-2' being loaded into the payload adapter (at left) and after release (at right). Chinese Internet via X There is the potential that the 'MD-2' and MD-21, the latter of which is seen in the background at one point in the video, are one and the same, or at least examples of the same design. Given the known existence now of the MD-19, MD-21, and MD-22 vehicles, another possibility could be that the one released from the balloon was the MD-20. Whether the various MD-series vehicles are all testbeds and/or test articles supporting the development of a single design or are differently scaled members of a family of designs, and whether there are any additional related types, are unknown. In April, a grainy image emerged showing a Chinese H-6 bomber variant carrying a still unidentified dark-colored aerospace vehicle, seen below, which may have been an MD-22 or a related design, under its fuselage. Versions of the H-6 are used operationally as launch platforms for the WZ-8 rocket-powered supersonic spy drone. Chinese Internet via X Past descriptions have presented the MD-22 as a platform intended to support the development of hypersonic technologies more broadly. The Chinese government has been investing heavily in hypersonic capabilities in general in recent years and continues to do so, and those developments certainly require an array of specialized test assets and associated infrastructure. Various testbeds, including Stratolaunch's Talon-A, which is similar in some broad strokes to the MD types, but is larger and not air-breathing, are part of the U.S. military's hypersonic development plans for the same reasons. At the Zhuhai Airshow this year, the same GARA that worked on the MD-22 notably displayed a concept for an unpowered hypersonic boost-glide weapon called the GDF-600 designed to be loaded with various submunitions. Launching payloads of any kind from a platform traveling at hypersonic speed presents significant technological challenges because of the physical and thermal stresses involved, particularly during separation. The MD-series vehicles could be useful for proving out such a capability. It remains unclear whether there are any plans to operationalize the MD-series vehicles directly, but it would not be hard to see potential interest in doing so. An MD-series platform used to demonstrate how a high-altitude hypersonic air vehicle could perform missions like kinetic strike or intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), would be a clear stepping stone to an operational capability. Even smaller, shorter-range variations could be used in a similar role as the WZ-8 or even as missiles. Combining rocket motors with a high-speed air-breathing main propulsion system would also offer a valuable self-contained solution that could allow for multiple launch options, as is seen in the newly emerged video. Being able to air-launch the vehicles could extend their reach and otherwise provide additional flexibility in a real-world context.

M1A2 Abrams Tanks Arrive In Taiwan	Taiwan has received its first batch of M1A2T Abrams main battle tanks as it continues its drive to modernize its armed forces, which face an expanding military threat from Beijing. While the upgrade for the Republic of China Army (ROCA) — which was still operating 1950s-era M41A3 Walker Bulldog light tanks up until recently — is obvious, there are still questions about how suitable the big and heavy Abrams is for the island’s very particular defensive requirements. Heavy Armors Have Arrived!Welcome to join us!#M1A2T #ROCArmy pic.twitter.com/OTXtU7pw5h&mdash; 國防部 Ministry of National Defense, ROC(Taiwan) (@MoNDefense) December 16, 2024 Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense (MND) confirmed today that the first shipment of M1A2T tanks had arrived from the United States. On its official social media channel, the MND published imagery showing the Abrams being inspected and then loaded onto flatbed trucks for onward transport. The tanks were apparently unloaded from a ship at the port of Taipei yesterday. According to Taiwan’s state-owned Central News Agency (CNA), the initial shipment comprised 38 M1A2T tanks, at least some of which will be delivered to the ROCA’s Army Armor Training Command at Hsinchu in northwestern Taiwan. Other reports from Taiwan suggest that 10 of the new tanks will remain with the training unit, while the others will go to frontline armored brigades in Linkou District, New Taipei, and in Hukou Township, Hsinchu County. From there, they would be best positioned to help defend northern Taiwan. Part of the first shipment of M1A2T tanks is prepared for onward transport. Taiwan Ministry of National Defense In total, Taiwan has 108 M1A2T tanks on order. Citing the MND, the CNA reports that another 42 of the tanks will be delivered next year, with the remaining 28 to follow in 2026. Taiwan’s order for M1A2T tanks was approved in July 2019, in a deal valued at around $2 billion, as announced by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA). The arms package also included 250 Block I-92F Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, M88A2 armored recovery vehicles, and Oshkosh M1070A1 heavy equipment transporters. 'This proposed sale of M1A2 tanks will contribute to the modernization of the recipient’s main battle tank fleet, enhancing its ability to meet current and future regional threats and to strengthen its homeland defense,' the DSCA’s statement said at the time. 'These tanks will contribute to the recipient’s goal of updating its military capability while further enhancing interoperability with the United States and other partners.' Covered by a tarpaulin, one of the first M1A2T is transported by road. Taiwan Ministry of National Defense The ‘T’ in the designation of the new tanks indicates that this version was specifically developed for Taiwan. Previous Taiwanese media reports also described these as 'M1A2X' tanks. Broadly speaking, the M1A2T is equivalent to the M1A2 SEPv3 version — or System Enhancement Package version 3 — which you can read more about here. Development of the SEPv3 was launched by the U.S. Army in response to lessons learned during fighting in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Changes to the tank address space, weight, and power issues, as well as enhancing overall survivability. The SEPv3 version offers increased electrical power, vehicle health management systems, upgraded armor, the ability to deploy the Israeli-made Trophy active protection system, integrated counter-improvised explosive device (IED) protection, a new auxiliary power unit, and embedded training aids. The U.S. Army describes it as 'the most reliable Abrams tank ever produced.' A U.S. Army M1A2 SEPv3 main battle tank. U.S. Army The M1A2T specifically features a reconfigured turret and various unspecified modifications to improve its survivability, as well as a modified electrical system and auxiliary power unit, and a new ammunition datalink — used when firing programmable munitions. Taiwan’s requirement for new armor is reflected in the fact that the last tanks to be delivered from the United States were M60A3s, orders for which began to be received in 1994. Since then, the ROCA has relied on M60A3s as well as locally upgraded CM11 and CM12 Brave Tiger tanks. A Republic of China Army CM11 Brave Tiger tank. 玄史生 via Wikimedia Commons The CM11, which first appeared in 1990, is something of a hybrid, combining the turret from older U.S.-supplied M48A3 Pattons with the chassis of the M60A3. This tank also features a fire-control system derived from that found on the M1A1 Abrams, making it more accurate, including on the move. Taiwan also obtained a significant number of additional fire-control upgrade kits and installed them on some of their remaining M48A3s, resulting in the CM12. A Republic of China Army CM12 tank prepared for transport. 玄史生 via Wikimedia Commons Until 2022, the ROCA also used the M41A3 Walker Bulldog light tank, a type first delivered to the U.S. Army in 1951, which saw Cold War-era combat with the U.S. military during the Bay of Pigs invasion and later in Vietnam. Taiwan introduced it back in 1958 but later used it for training. An M41A3 in Republic of China Army service. Youth Daily News Nevertheless, much-reworked M41D tanks, based on the original M41 but with a new diesel engine, re-armed turret, and thermal imaging equipment, remain in use in small numbers. Even discounting the antiquated M41, the M1A2T is a much more modern and capable proposition than any of the ROCA’s other tanks. The M60A3, CM11, and CM12 are all armed with 105mm main guns that are outclassed by the larger 120mm cannons on modern Chinese main battle tanks, for example. The M1A2T uses a 120mm main gun complemented by a Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS) that combines a sensor suite with a machine gun. Facing the threat of a People’s Liberation Army (PLA) invasion, Taiwan’s defensive strategy means that every single tank and armored vehicle would have to count toward the island’s defense, were it to go to war. With Beijing continuing to claim Taiwan as its territory and with repeated threats to invade and seize control of the island by force if necessary, this has driven the retention of even obsolescent equipment. This is something that the M1A2T deliveries go some way to address. ROCA tanks and other assets take part in Combat Readiness Week maneuvers in 2020: On the other hand, the Abrams is a big, heavy, expensive, and maintenance-intensive machine. Even sustaining these tanks in combat is a big ask, their gas-turbine engines placing significant demands on fuel, especially. I think we need to mention sustaining these in a fight, including keeping them fueled, is an issue While there’s no doubting its firepower and performance, as well as very high levels of protection, it’s not invulnerable — as Ukraine’s experience has demonstrated. At the same time, the weight of the Abrams — especially the SEPv3 version — is such that it is not always able to negotiate softer ground or more basic roads. When Australia ordered the SEPv3, it was reported that significant parts of the north of that country — where much military training takes place — is too swampy and the roads too rudimentary to support the new tanks. The Trophy active protection system alone is said to add around 5,000 pounds of weight, with an overall weight, in combat, of 73.6 tons. It’s unclear if Taiwan will receive Trophy for its Abrams, but the equipment would provide a very useful additional layer of protection against various threats — including potentially drones. The Abrams is also arguably not best suited to the kinds of urban warfare that the ROCA might have to engage in if it meets a PLA invasion — something that it already regularly trains for in just these kinds of settings. These kinds of scenarios pose a particular challenge for main battle tanks. A ROCA M113 armored personnel carrier concealed under a bridge during an urban combat exercise. ROC Military News Agency More generally, there are questions about the utility of heavy armor in potential conflicts in the Indo-Pacific region. Most such scenarios are expected to heavily feature air and sea platforms, as well as missiles. These concerns have also led to a resurgence in interest in light tanks, including the U.S. Army’s new M10 Booker, which you can read all about here. A U.S. Army M10 Booker light tank. U.S. Army The M10 Booker. US Army In fact, the particular advantages of the M10 for Taiwan are something we have discussed in the past, speaking to an armor expert: 'The Booker would prove a valuable platform in a Taiwan ground fight … About two-thirds of the island is mostly rugged mountains. It features flat to rolling plains in the densely populated west, which faces mainland China. The M10’s smaller size compared to an Abrams would allow it to better maneuver through the tight, restricted urban areas where much of the fighting would take place. It would be able to pass over bridges an Abrams might not be able to cross due to weight concerns and operate … with a much lighter logistical footprint. The smaller 105mm main gun on the M10, the same expert added, 'is powerful enough to handle most Chinese equipment.' Nevertheless, for the time being, the ROCA is focused on the M1A2T and the major advantages in firepower and protection that it will bring compared with its predecessors. It’s also important to note that these tanks are just part of a multilayered defensive strategy for the ROCA, which also includes AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, long-range artillery, and multiple-launch rocket systems, as well as coastal defense missiles that would hope to create havoc among an invasion fleet before it even managed to land any troops and supporting armor. The nature of the modern battlefield and its myriad threats means that tank-on-tank warfare is not as probable nowadays as it once was, although Ukraine has shown the tank is not a dead concept by any means. But should it happen that the Republic of China Army has to face Chinese tanks in such a situation, the M1A2T Abrams at least offers a much higher level of capabilities than the tanks otherwise in Taiwanese service.

Drone Incursions Closed Wright Patterson Air Force Base’s Airspac...	The sprawling Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio is the latest military installation to report mysterious drones flying over its airspace, The War Zone has learned. 'I can confirm small aerial systems were spotted over Wright Patterson between Friday night and Saturday morning,' base spokesman Bob Purtiman told The War Zone on Sunday in response to our questions about the sightings. 'Today leaders have determined that they did not impact base residents, facilities, or assets. The Air Force is taking all appropriate measures to safeguard our installations and residents.' The drones 'ranged in sizes and configurations,' Purtiman said. 'Our units are working with local authorities to ensure the safety of base personnel, facilities, and assets.' The sprawling Wright Patterson AFB complex. (Google Earth) After the drones were seen over Wright Patterson, a Notice To Airman (NOTAM) was issued closing the airspace between Friday night and Saturday morning. The airspace has since been reopened, Purtiman said.

It's home to the Air Force Research Lab, Air Force Material Command, the 655th Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Wing, the National Air and Space Intelligence Center, the 445th Airlift Wing and the host 88th Air Base Wing, among other base tenants. The confirmation of drones over Wright Patterson came a day after the FBI, Department of Homeland Security, Federal Aviation Administration, and Defense Department (DoD) held a joint press conference to address the growing concern about sightings over the U.S., mostly in the airspace above New Jersey. The War Zone was the first to report the confirmation of drones being spotted over Picatinny Arsenal in that state. Since then, there has been a flood of mostly unconfirmed and erroneous reported sightings throughout New Jersey. Of more than 5,000 tips called into a national hotline set up to deal with these sightings, fewer than 100 generated leads 'deemed worthy of further investigation,' an FBI spokesman told reporters, including from The War Zone, on Saturday The overwhelming majority of these sightings, as we have previously reported, are crewed aircraft, the official reiterated on Saturday. 'Most of the reports of UAS have originated from the ground, with very, very few reports of UAS activities from pilots of manned aircraft,' said the FBI official, speaking on condition of anonymity. 'Overlaying the visual sightings reported to the FBI with approach patterns for Newark-Liberty, JFK, and LaGuardia airports - the density of reported sightings matches the approach patterns of these very busy airports, flights coming in throughout the night. This modeling is indicative of manned aviation being quite often mistaken with unmanned aviation or UAS.' Still, as we have reported in the past, there are several confirmed drone sightings in New Jersey reported by trained observers at Picatinny and Naval Weapons Station Earle in New Jersey. A Coast Guard vessel off New Jersey also had a recent encounter with drones. U.S. officials are still trying to discover the origin of drones that appeared over four U.S. Air Force Bases in the U.K., a story we first broke. They’ve been spotted over RAF Lakehheath, RAF Mildenhall, and RAF Feltwell, all within close proximity, and RAF Fairford, about 130 miles to the west. A stock picture of a 'No Drone Zone' sign and other warnings along the perimeter of RAF Lakenheath. Mark Kerrison/In Pictures via Getty Images Though the origin of these drones remains a mystery, DoD officials continue to claim that they are neither dangerous nor actions by foreign adversaries. 'We have no intelligence or observations that would indicate that they were aligned with a foreign actor or that they had malicious intent, but just kind of simply tell you we don't know. We have not been able to locate or identify the operators who are the points of origin,' the DoD official told reporters on Saturday. 'The main point is to deter the activity using some of our electronic means that can respond to most of these small commercial systems and deny them access to the airspace over our bases. We don't know what the activity is. We don't know &#8230; if it is criminal. But I will tell you that it is irresponsible. Here on the military side, we are just as frustrated with the irresponsible nature of this activity.' Such ambiguity is wearing thin on the public as people are increasingly demanding clarity from the federal government on the issue. Wright Patterson is just the latest in a long string of drone sightings over sensitive facilities and military capabilities. A few days ago, Ramstein Air Base in Germany joined the growing list of places registering unknown drone overflights. The U.S. Air Force has confirmed that there were drones seen over Ramstein Air Base in Germany. (Boris Roessler/picture alliance via Getty Images) TWZ has been on the leading edge of covering this topic for years and has broken multiple stories now about drone incursions over key U.S. bases and training ranges, as well as uncrewed aerial systems harassing American forces off the coasts of the United States and making worrisome overflights of important non-military sites. A spate of drone incursions over Langley Air Force Base in Virginia in December 2023, which TWZ was the first report on, has now become a particular focal point of concern about these instances. Most of the New Jersey drone sightings were misidentified, so it is notable that the ones spotted over Wright Patterson, as with the other U.S. military installations, were seen by trained observers that are equipped with high-end gear to maintain security and to discriminate between friend and foe. We will continue to provide additional details on the Wright Patterson AFB incident and the larger drone incursions story as we get them.

Bunker Talk: Let’s Talk About All The Things We Did And Didn’t Co...	Welcome to a belated Bunker Talk. This is a weekend open discussion post for the best commenting crew on the net, in which we can chat about all the stuff that went on this week that we didn’t cover. We can also talk about the stuff we did or whatever else grabs your interest. In other words, it’s an off-topic thread. Also, a reminder: Prime Directives! If you want to talk politics, do so respectfully and know that there’s always somebody that isn’t going to agree with you. If you have political differences, hash it out respectfully, stick to the facts, and no childish name-calling or personal attacks of any kind. If you can’t handle yourself in that manner, then please, discuss virtually anything else. No drive-by garbage political memes. No conspiracy theory rants. Links to crackpot sites will be axed, too. Trolling and shitposting will not be tolerated. No obsessive behavior about other users. Just don’t interact with folks you don’t like. Do not be a sucker and feed trolls! That’s as much on you as on them. Use the mute button if you don’t like what you see. So unless you have something of quality to say, know how to treat people with respect, understand that everyone isn’t going to subscribe to your exact same worldview, and have come to terms with the reality that there is no perfect solution when it comes to moderation of a community like this, it’s probably best to just move on. Finally, as always, report offenders, please. This doesn’t mean reporting people who don’t share your political views, but we really need your help in this regard. The Bunker is open!

Cockpit Video Of Ukrainian Su-27 Lobbing GBU-39 Small Diameter Bo...	A recently released video from the cockpit of a Ukrainian Air Force Su-27 Flanker provides an unprecedented close-quarters view of the fighter lobbing a salvo of GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs (SDB) toward a Russian target. The U.S.-supplied weapon is part of an armory of Western precision-guided munitions integrated on the Soviet-era Su-27, others including the AGM-88 High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile, or HARM, and the Joint Direct Attack Munition–Extended Range, or JDAM-ER. Remarkable cockpit footage of a Ukrainian Air Force Su-27 Flanker launching a salvo of four US-supplied GBU-39 SDB glide bombs at a Russian target. The Ukrainian Flanker tosses the glide bombs while in a 60+ degree climb. pic.twitter.com/EBhPsFjQyc&mdash; OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) December 13, 2024 The footage shows the Su-27 — painted in a ‘digital’ camouflage scheme — launching a salvo of four of the U.S.-supplied glide bombs, while in a climb, at an angle of around 60 degrees. This maneuver has the effect of increasing the standoff range of the weapon while helping to keep the launching aircraft exposed to air defense threats for a minimal amount of time. It’s something that we’ve come to see regularly over the battlefield, performed by fixed-wing tactical jets and helicopters. An accompanying video purports to show the impacts of the munitions, although it cannot be verified that these are the results of the same engagement. While Ukrainian Su-27s have been employing SDBs in combat for some time, they have only rarely been seen with the weapons attached, using the BRU-61/A rack, designed to hold up to four of these 250-pound-class weapons.

In previous images of MiG-29s carrying SDBs, we’ve also been able to observe a special pylon with what may be a white-colored antenna or sensor, mounted at the front. It appears the Su-27 in the latest video lacks that feature on the pylon, or it might only appear under the opposite wing. In the past, we surmised that this could be connected with an electronic countermeasures system, seen in the photo below, which you can read more about in this previous feature. A GBU-39/B-armed MiG-29. Three SDBs are loaded on a standard BRU-61/A rack, which is designed to hold up to four of these 250-pound-class weapons. @air_winged via X The Ukrainian military first disclosed it had begun employing air-launched SDBs in May. In terms of integration of the weapon, the SDB, in common with other Western missiles and precision-guided bombs, is combined with an iPad, or similar tablets-like device, mounted in the cockpit to actually employ the weapon. In addition to SDBs and the JDAM-ER, Ukraine’s glide-bomb arsenal includes French-made rocket-assisted AASM-250 Hammers, which you can read more about here. Ukraine’s use of the SDB, as well as other Western standoff precision weapons, mirrors Russia’s extensive employment of glide bombs of various types. While Russian standoff bombs have been a particular problem for Ukrainian air defenses, recent reports suggest that their effectiveness has started to drop off. A Russian UMPK-series glide bomb strapped on a Su-34 Fullback strike fighter. Russian Ministry of Defense According to the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Russian attacks against Ukraine using guided aerial bombs have fallen by half, since Western partners allowed Kyiv to strike targets deep within Russia using long-range missiles. As a result, Russian tactical airpower has increasingly been pushed back to bases further from the front lines, impacting maintenance, sortie rates, and flight hours, which in turn reduced the number of sorties of this kind. As for the SDB, this continues to provide Ukraine with a powerful tool for attacking targets at standoff ranges of up to around 46 miles with high accuracy. In the scenario shown in the video, with a pop-up launch at lower altitude, the range would be much reduced.

At the same time, individual aircraft can be loaded with multiple SDBs, allowing more targets to be struck per sortie — as in the latest video. Earlier reports suggested that the SDB has also proven notably resilient to jamming. According to an article in The Washington Post earlier this year, citing confidential internal Ukrainian assessments, 'nearly 90 percent of dropped [Small Diameter Bombs] struck their target.' An SDB immediately before hitting a mock hardened aircraft shelter during a test. U.S. Air Force The bombs are designed to penetrate semi-hardened static targets. They have been tasked heavily in support of the Kursk operation, especially for destroying bridges, including temporary ones. Another major advantage is the significant stocks of the weapon held by NATO allies. With that in mind, more insights into the Ukrainian Air Force’s operations with the Small Diameter Bomb, used by both the MiG-29 and Su-27, may well emerge in the future.

There’s A Growing Market For Counter-Drone Systems For Superyacht...	While aerial drone attacks on maritime vessels have thus far focused on commercial and naval ships, there is growing concern that quarter-billion dollar-plus superyachts, and the VIPs who own and cruise in them, may be vulnerable. Similar small unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) used by ambitious paparazzi to photograph the vessels and people of the superyacht scene for over a decade have proven deadly when weaponized in Ukraine and elsewhere as The War Zone has frequently chronicled. This reality has created a small, but growing market for counter-UAS (CUAS) systems for superyachts. Over the last five years, a number of firms have begun to offer CUAS capabilities for ultra-luxury vessels, including London/Monaco-based MARSS, which recently completed the installation of its NiDAR CUAS systems on an undisclosed 400-foot (120m) superyacht and its 230-foot (70m) 'support vessel.' The installation cost approximately $4M and builds upon four previous NiDAR systems integrated by the company on new-build and existing superyachts in 2023. As costly as such systems are, a small, but increasing number of owners figure they’re worth it. (MARSS) Their calculus is set against the broader superyacht business, which is down slightly this year, but that has boomed over the last several years as global wealth has continued to concentrate and the global pandemic attached new value to both seclusion and seizing pleasure while one can. According to a feature in The New Yorker, the number of private yachts over 250 feet (76m) in length climbed from less than ten in 1990 to well over 120 in 2022. The largest of them (sometimes called megayachts or gigayachts) rival or exceed naval destroyers in length with hulls longer than 500 feet (152m). To go with their size, superyachts are owned by people with pull – business moguls, royals, top celebrities, and oligarchs. These people host equally high-profile and some very powerful but lower-profile individuals aboard their lavish vessels. Some of these figures can be major targets. In addition, these yachts have to travel through tough global neighborhoods to reach their destinations and they are clearly prime targets, even symbolic ones, themselves. MONTE-CARLO, MONACO - MAY 24: A general view of the yachts in the marina prior to practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Monaco at Circuit de Monaco on May 24, 2024 in Monte-Carlo, Monaco. (Photo by Peter Fox - Formula 1/Formula 1 via Getty Images) JK SPORTSPHOTOGRAPHY So needless to say, security is already top of mind. This has long been the case in the Middle East where superyachts owned and operated by royal families or governments blur the line between private and state capabilities. The VIP/force protection for some yacht owners in the region has seen military capabilities deployed as part of standard protection. Lower-profile owners commonly employ highly experienced security teams for their superyachts. Such teams offer direct protection, risk mitigation planning, and the kind of threat assessment expertise that may convince an owner to acquire a counter-drone system. Privacy Or Protection MARSS’ end-to-end, detect to defeat CUAS solution is offered for fixed-site land and mobile applications, pairing the firm’s proprietary AI-enabled NiDAR command/control software, and user interface with vendor-supplied sensors (radar, electro-optical/thermal), countermeasures, and effectors. It has been available for several years and gained major market share in the Middle East according to MARSS vice president of business development, Josh Harman. In fact, the company’s NiDAR platform was integrated into the recent joint U.S./Saudi Arabia Red Sands 24.2 CUAS exercise as the central C2 and sensor fusion software in a layered defense. MARSS offers its scalable NiDAR solution for CUAS needs, which can incorporate various sensors and effectors based on the threat requirements. (MARSS) MARSS’ maritime CUAS features the same NiDAR C2 and sensor fusion but with an important difference. While it employs radar, optical, and passive radio frequency (RF) sensors along with software infused with AI to detect and classify UASs, it does not include any ‘soft-kill’ or kinetic drone-defeat countermeasures. That’s because such mitigation features aren’t explicitly legal for private vessels, Frederik Giepmans, managing director for MARSS Maritime told TWZ in an interview. While international maritime conventions like the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) or the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) currently say little about the permissibility of drone-defeat systems on commercial vessels or yachts, the laws of the respective flag-countries under which they operate generally prohibit passive or active drone defenses on these platforms. Laws within different territorial waters come into play as well. However, the prohibitions on drone mitigation have not prevented the emergence of a superyacht CUAS market. Giepmans acknowledges that owners are reluctant to discuss the threat of airborne drones to the privacy or safety of their vessels but they have been quietly buying systems from MARSS, United Kingdom-based Drone Defence, and CACI among others. NiDAR C2 interface in action. (MARSS) MARSS maritime counter-drone system can utilize Echodyne radars, Aaronia passive RF sensors, and Current Science Corporation EO/IR cameras to detect small to midsize UAS at ranges out to about 12 miles (20km). MARSS points out that its NiDAR system is sensor agnostic so detection ranges will vary depending on what sensors are installed with the chosen suite. It’s worth noting that MARSS seeks to offer comprehensive threat awareness for superyachts with its NiDAR 4D suite which, in addition to airborne drones, detects surface and underwater threats (UUVs/divers) using a variety of radar, optical, thermal, and sonar sensors. (MARSS) NiDAR’s proprietary AI handles UAS classification using video/radar/passive RF behavior pattern recognition, object data points, event history analysis, and other inputs. Once an airborne target is detected and identified, alerts are relayed to the yacht’s crew via the NiDAR user interface. Responses may include getting owners and guests below decks and into safe interior spaces and notifying local authorities of drone activity. Despite the questionable legality of using drone-defeat systems, jamming or kinetic actions by a yacht with the right equipment are possible. When pressed, MARSS Maritime’s managing director acknowledged that some owners have acquired active drone-defeat capabilities to go with CUAS detection though not from MARSS he says. Simon Rowland, CEO of Veritas International, a United Kingdom-based private security firm that provides ex-military security personnel, cybersecurity, and other technical security services to the luxury yacht market, agrees. 'There are routes to installing the other half of the system, but you’ve got to find the right sort of place. There are export control issues for one, but I imagine there are creative routes to market,' he says. However, going to such lengths is rare and generally superfluous with respect to current threats Rowland asserts. For the time being, drone threats to superyachts appear to be limited to threats to privacy, not physical harm. Rowland adds that he doesn’t know of any superyacht that has experienced an aggressive physical threat from airborne drones. 'That’s not to say it hasn’t happened. I’m just not aware of anything. There’s no trend I would say.' The U.S. Coast Guard apparently hasn’t identified a trend either. In response to a query regarding reports of unwanted drone activity around large yachts, a USCG spokesman offered The War Zone a somewhat cryptic reply. 'The Coast Guard does not have any readily available data on specific ‘unauthorized small UAS’ near large recreational vessels.' In the often secretive world of superyachts, it can be difficult to divine hidden concerns but both Rowland and Giepmans told The War Zone that in their view there is as yet no collective industry acceptance that airborne drone threats will become a widely standard conversation. The super-yacht Savannah in Portland Port.(Photo by Finnbarr Webster/Getty Images) Finnbarr Webster Joshua Hutchinson managing director at Ambrey, another United Kingdom-based maritime security firm with a focus on commercial shipping, says that when the Houthi threat to shipping in the Red Sea emerged in late 2023, 'there was an initial burst of [CUAS system] inquiries, both from commercial shipping and the private yacht market.' Interest has cooled, he says, adding that Ambrey has tested several CUAS detection systems like MARRS’ in the Red Sea but has not evaluated drone defeat systems. The reason is that given the generally line-of-sight ranges at which small UAS operate, Hutchinson sees them as less of a threat to privacy or security in open water and more of an issue while commercial vessels or superyachts are in or near port. Hutchinson also points out that for less common, larger fixed-wing drones that fly at higher speeds, say between which fly at 90 to 185 mph (150-300 kph), most CUAS systems’ detection ranges (3-6 miles, 5-10km) afford only 15 to 20 seconds notice of a target and its direction, narrowing effective mitigation responses considerably. 'Your response time is extremely small and human error is vast,' he says. A Shahed-136 recorded by a perusing Ukrainian Mi-8. Fixed-wing extended-range drones can fly faster over long distances, making them harder to defeat and predict. (Ukrainian Air Force screencap) Surface threats, whether piracy or terror, with manned or unmanned vessels, have longer detection timelines, offer better visual cues, and are easier to track thanks to approach speeds generally less than 15 mph (25 kph). Vessels can identify potential surface threats more easily and take evasive action. This could include deploying armed security teams and firing warning shots, if a vessel is hosting them, or otherwise denying a surface vessel a chance to close. 'We’ve seen that with the unmanned surface vessels launched by the Houthis and with pirates,' Hutchinson attests. The implication is that counter-manned/unmanned surface systems are likely more effective for both commercial vessels and superyachts than CUAS systems. - Moment a Houthi USV struck the British oil tanker, Cordelia Moon. The security team on board missed every shot. - RN pic.twitter.com/O7ToDgUh0r&mdash; Zlatti71 (@Zlatti_71) October 2, 2024 Thus far, Ambrey has yet to see a maritime CUAS system come to market that can guarantee effective drone defeat in all circumstances for superyachts or commercial vessels Hutchinson adds, suggesting the most effective mitigation still lies in early assessment of risk and changing operational procedures (altering course, turning off AIS, limiting signal emissions) to avoid it. However, CUAS systems are being sold to private owners in part because of the operational predictability of the superyacht world. In the summer yachts flock to Monaco, the French Riviera, the Greek and Aegean islands, and other southern European locales stretching East to the Levant. In winter they migrate to a handful of popular Caribbean anchorages, to Miami, and a few locations to the north of South America. Yachts are moored at the Hercules Port in Monaco on September 22, 2021, during the 30th edition of the International Monaco Yacht Show. - The Monaco Yacht Show is considered the most prestigious pleasure boat show in the world with the exhibition of 500 major companies in luxury yachting and featuring over a hundred super and megayachts. (Photo by Valery HACHE / AFP) (Photo by VALERY HACHE/AFP via Getty Images) VALERY HACHE At each of these, they are generally within sight of land and the line-of-sight range of small drones. They’re static, at the pier or riding at anchor in a harbor, magnifying opportunities for snooping or malfeasance. They can also be located with ease. 'What people always forget about the shipping industry,' Hutchinson observes, 'is that we’ve created this culture of readily available public information. You can download an [automatic identification system (AIS)] app on your phone in 30 seconds and track 90,000 ships for free.' Or you can go online to sites like ShipLocation.com, which has a 'superyachts tracker.' The perceived vulnerabilities may be enough to convince a yacht owner to install a CUAS system. Nevertheless, Simon Rowland says he doesn’t think security firms like Veritas or yacht builders want to 'go down the route of selling fear'. 'I think there’s a reluctance to highlight a potential significant threat before that threat materializes.' But he acknowledges that the threat of drones, whether to privacy or yacht security, is rising. 'We are on a sliding scale and it isn’t [diminishing], it’s sliding up, getting greater.' The Vanity Market Even if owners are concerned about the possibility of prowling UAVs, there’s another obstacle to selling CUAS systems to the superyacht crowd, Rowland affirms. It’s how they look. 'The last thing an owner would like to do is to strap on to their beautifully-designed yacht an ugly piece of equipment to deal with a threat which may or may not materialize. There’s an element of vanity in the [yacht] market.' Aesthetic concerns are well known to MARSS and other providers who have worked in recent years to both decrease the size, weight and power (SWaP) requirements of CUAS systems and to blend them into superyacht profiles. 'This is of high importance,' Giepmans agrees. 'When it comes to placing sensors it is imperative that they fit in with the overall appearance and design of the yacht. This is done through custom mounting solutions, color schemes and placing sensors within radomes where possible.' The ball-style radomes seen on any number of superyachts built in the last decade, usually located high atop their superstructures, can sometimes accommodate additional sensors or subtly cloak sensors placed near them. Others (cameras, passive radio antennas) can be discreetly placed on the wings which often adorn masts atop the vessels. A rendering showing a CUAS sensor system on a yacht mast that incorporates EO/IR cameras with microwave radar arrays. (MARSS) There is another aspect of appearances that may carry weight. Superyacht owners exist within a culture of one-upmanship. If the yacht next to yours at Cap d’Antibes is rumored to have a sophisticated counter-UAS system, you may feel the need to acquire your own to keep pace. And when money is not an object, why wouldn’t you have that feature just like all the others on your massive yacht and, more increasingly often, the toy-packed support vessels that shadow them? The pressure to provide UAS detection and countermeasures for superyachts may eventually extend beyond the vessels themselves, Hutchinson says. 'Where do you put the pressure? Is the onus on the owner/operators or do you put it on the ports, forcing them to change their ISPS codes [International Ship and Port Facility Security Code] to say that ‘we are a secure UAV environment?'

(Photo by Sabri Kesen/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) Anadolu The odds that superyacht owners and their guests are considered important enough that they might one day enjoy drone-free zones in various ports could change the calculus for acquiring CUAS systems but it remains only a future possibility, not a given. Similarly, owners face a conundrum when considering adding drone detection to their yachts to ensure privacy or protection - should they buy today or buy tomorrow? 'Do you buy the latest tech or do you wait?' Hutchinson asks. 'Where are you operating? What’s your threat and security risk assessment? If you’re concerned, you’re going to be making a high investment into relatively new tech. But in two to three years’ time I think [CUAS acquisition] will be business as usual.' Simon Rowland takes a slightly different view, averring that decision-making based on privacy and security risks is often made by others with the general approval of superyacht owners. 'It’s a nuanced and complicated part of yacht ownership. For the most part, owners farm these discussions away to other people&#8230; within the build process or within the organization that’s overseeing the build.' Giepmans says that yacht builders are slowly integrating CUAS systems into the construction process of their vessels, consulting with firms like MARSS when owners specify inclusion.

One publicly acknowledged UAS attack on a yacht would change everything, rapidly propelling the market. 'I think the market for counter-UAV is just starting,' Hutchinson concludes. 'Especially in the private market, these kinds of systems will be built-in. There’ll be an expectation that you can have jamming, that you can protect privacy as well as security.' The transformation that UAS have wrought on the battlefields of Ukraine, Gaza, Lebanon, the Red Sea, and elsewhere is spilling over to many other areas of modern security, creating both risks and fortunes. The direct technology and enabling technologies that have made it a reality have been shepherded by some of the very people who have acquired superyachts in the last few years. A slowly growing group of them are buying CUAS systems for their vessels. 'The irony is inescapable,' Rowland observes.

Russian Forces Appear To Be Pulling Out Of Prized Syrian Air Base	There are clear signs that Russian forces, including an S-400 surface-to-air missile system, are withdrawing from Khmeimim Air Base in Syria. At the same time, authorities in Russia continue to insist that no final decisions have been made about the future of their presence at Khmeimim or their naval base in Tartus since the fall of their long-time ally Bashar Al Assad last weekend. These are highly strategic and irreplaceable locations the Kremlin uses to project military power well beyond Syria. Satellite imagery taken today of Khmeimim (also written Hmeimim) that The War Zone obtained from Maxar provides the latest evidence that a withdrawal of at least some Russian forces from the base is underway now. As seen at the top of this story and below, two very large An-124 airlifters are prominently visible at the base with their noses open, appearing to be ready to load cargo. There are also three Il-76 Candid cargo planes parked on a large open apron at the northeast end of the facility. Satellite image ©2024 Maxar Technologies At least one of the Il-76s presently at Khmeimim is a Syrian Airlines aircraft and a Yakovlev Yak-40 airliner, which the Syrian flag carrier also has in its inventory, looks to be parked next to it. Smaller An-72 Coaler and An-26 Curl transports, as well as a Su-35 Flanker-E fighter, are also seen in the imagery. There may be more tactical jets under the row of shelters at the northeastern end of the base. A broader look at the northern end of Khmeimim Air Base as seen on December 13, 2024. Satellite image ©2024 Maxar Technologies The Maxar images also show Russian forces are packing up the S-400 surface-to-air missile site at Khmeimim, as well as other air defense assets. What looks to be a Ka-52 attack helicopter is also seen with its rotor blades removed, likely for transport.

Russian Il-76s, as well as the Syrian Airlines one, and the An-72 are also visible in that footage, along with four Su-34 Fullback, seven Su-24 Fencer, and four Flanker-series combat jets.

This pointed to plans to load it onto the aircraft for movement elsewhere. Other elements of the S-400 system at Khmeimim were still visible in their emplacements, but did not appear to be in a deployed mode. For instance, transport erector launchers were seen in travel configurations with their missile tubes down, as well. All of this is in line with what is seen in the new Maxar imagery. The Russian S400 is definitely leaving Khmeimim Air Base.

As The War Zone has previously noted, moving ships out of Tartus is a prudent force protection measure given the current fluidity of the situation in Syria. Even if major rebel groups have given the Kremlin certain security guarantees, the ships would have still be huge and relatively defenseless targets sitting pierside. The Syria TV footage of Khmeimim only underscores the current unprecedented freedom of access in Syria after decades of the country being a brutal totalitarian police state, as well as the potential risks this brings to Russian bases in the country. The War Zone reports often about the ever-growing threat of drone attacks, including ones launched by actors relatively close by, especially on air bases and other critical facilities, in general. A mass drone attack on Khmeimim in 2018 was a major herald of things to come and the base has a long history of being subjected to indirect fire of various kinds by rebel forces. The departure of air defense assets from Khmeimim, especially point-defense systems, will only increase the vulnerability of that base to aerial threats. That, in turn, could point to more serious withdrawal plans. Even if Russia ultimately retains its bases in Syria, it is still very possible that its overall force posture in the country could change, as well. This SHORAD position filmed yesterday by a drone was empty this morning. Removing SHORAD from Khmeimin Air Base is only something the Russian forces would do if they are leaving the base. pic.twitter.com/VA7mg4QpcI&mdash; Oliver Alexander (@OAlexanderDK) December 13, 2024 As The War Zone has stressed before, Russia losing Khmeimim and Tartus would be a huge blow to Russia with ramifications well beyond Syria. Assad has essentially gifted the facilities to the Russian government through a 49-year 'lease' deal in 2017 and the Kremlin has invested considerable resources in expanding them since then. The bases offer highly strategic nodes for projecting air and naval power into the Mediterranean, including along NATO's southern flank, and into Africa, as well as elsewhere in the Middle East. Tartus is especially significant because it is the Russian Navy's only current warm-water port facility with direct access to the Mediterranean, but Khmeimim is also a uniquely positioned operating location for the country's air force. The Russians are starting to get very nervous… They write that the loss of Syria as a refueling and logistics point undermines all of Russia's efforts on the African continent. pic.twitter.com/s4h5hWVgBk&mdash; MAKS 24 (@Maks_NAFO_FELLA) December 9, 2024 Bloomberg reported earlier today that Russia's Foreign Ministry 'believes it has an informal understanding' with the new transitional government emerging in Damascus, which rebel group Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) is leading, about keeping Khmeimim and Tartus. There have been previous reports that Russian authorities secured guarantees of access to both facilities, at least for some amount of time, during talks with various regional actors about the political transition ongoing in Syria. 'The bases are still there, where they were on Syrian territory,' Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov told reporters earlier this week, according to the country's Interfax news agency. 'No other decisions have been made for the moment.' 'They [the bases] were there at the Syrians' request with the aim of fighting terrorists from the Islamic State [IS]. I am proceeding on the basis of the notion that everyone agrees that the fight against terrorism, and what remains of IS, is not over,' Bogdanov added. '[That] requires collective efforts and in this connection, our presence and the Khmeimim base played an important role in the context of the overall fight against international terrorism.' Though Bogdanov's remarks here about the purpose of Russia's presence in Syria, which was central to keeping Assad safe from rebel groups not aligned with ISIS, are farcical, it does raise the possibility of the Kremlin trying to rebrand its role as part of a pitch to keep the bases. There have already been reports that Russian authorities are softening their tone toward HTS. Russia, as well as the United States, the United Kingdom, and others, have formally designated HTS as a terrorist group. The U.S. government still has a $10 million bounty out on HTS leader Ahmed Hussein Al Shar’a, better known by his nom de guerre Abu Mohammad Al Jolani (or simply as Jolani), as well. HTS leader Ahmed Hussein Al Shar’a (aka Abu Mohammad Al Jolani) addresses a crowd at the capital's landmark Umayyad Mosque on December 8, 2024. Aref TAMMAWI / AFP via Getty Images As The War Zone has noted in its previous reporting, Russia's position is complicated by its very active support for Assad. The Russian military's invention starting in 2015 was critical to saving the regime from rebels, including those that evolved into HTS, and keeping it in power. Russia's forces were still launching strikes on the same HTS-led forces it is now negotiating with just days before the regime's final collapse. Assad is also said to be in Russia, but he has not been publicly seen anywhere in more than a week now. Overall the situation across Syria is extremely complex, with multiple rebel factions jostling for control of different regions amid a lack of present centralized authority. U.S.-backed Kurdish forces are now openly fighting with Turkish-supported groups, with American authorities reportedly trying to mediate the situation. There are separate growing fears about ISIS and other terrorist groups exploiting the chaotic situation. At least for now though, there are clear indications that at least some Russian forces are leaving the country and that others are getting in position to withdraw.

U.S. Air Force Confirms Drone Sightings Over Ramstein Air Base In...	Germany is the latest country to report mysterious drone activity over an air base on its territory, specifically the sprawling U.S. facility at Ramstein, alongside similar incidents over critical industrial sites. The developments follow previous suspicious drone flights reported over infrastructure in Germany and a spate of security incidents at other air bases in the country earlier this year. Since then, U.S. Air Force facilities in England have also reported multiple drone incursions, which so far remain unexplained, while the United States is now deep into a wave of drone hysteria after similar reports out of bases on the East Coast. 'Possible spy drones' have been noted 'several times' flying over Ramstein Air Base, the main U.S. Air Force hub in Western Europe, according to a story today published by the Spiegel news magazine, citing a confidential report by German security authorities. Other similar incidents have been reported in the vicinity of the chemical company BASF, headquartered in Ludwigshafen, and the defense firm Rheinmetall. These companies are based in Rhineland-Palatinate, southwestern Germany — the same state in which Ramstein is located.

The Ramstein incidents have been confirmed by the U.S. military, with a spokeswoman for the base telling the Spiegel: 'In early December, there were several sightings of small unmanned aerial systems in the area and over Ramstein Air Base, they had no impact on the residents of the base and on the facilities and military equipment there.' The spokeswoman confirmed that the base is now 'in close coordination' with the German authorities regarding the incident. Ramstein Air Base in Germany. Google Earth As for Rheinmetall, this company has been at the forefront of German defense support for Ukraine since the full-scale invasion by Russia in 2022. The firm describes itself as 'Ukraine’s most important defense industry partner in the fight against Russian aggression.' Among the Ukraine-related projects the company is involved in are the manufacture of artillery ammunition and Lynx infantry fighting vehicles, the training of Ukrainian specialists in the maintenance and repair of combat vehicles, as well as helping establish manufacturing and maintenance hubs in Ukraine.

Photo by Yan Dobronosov/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images Global Images Ukraine Recent weeks have seen a string of reported drone incidents over U.S. Air Force bases in England as well as multiple sightings in the United States, notably over New Jersey. However, there have been reports of unexplained drone activity in Germany dating back to this summer. In particular, there were reports from the north of Germany, including over an industrial park in Brunsbüttel, northwest of Hamburg, which is home to a major floating liquid natural gas (LNG) terminal. At the time, prosecutors in Germany said they considered it likely the drone flights were related to 'espionage activity for sabotage purposes' and also cited 'repeated' drone flights over 'critical infrastructure.' Reports of drone flights over Brunsbüttel began on August 8 and it’s been claimed that the craft have proven difficult to track due to their high speeds —reportedly around 60 miles per hour — and their approach from the sea. Two ships carrying liquefied natural gas (LNG) docked in the Elbe port of Brunsbüttel, Germany, in April 2024. Photo by Axel Heimken/picture alliance via Getty Images picture alliance The local public prosecutor’s office launched an investigation into the Brunsbüttel incidents, on suspicion of 'agent activity for sabotage purposes.' The same topic was discussed by the German Interior Ministry, but they were unable to agree on a joint approach to countering the spy flights, the Spiegel. Other unusual activity in Germany in recent months includes a security alert at Geilenkirchen Air Base in August, which you can read more about here. This was due to fears of a possible Russian drone attack, according to a German media report. An unnamed source within German intelligence confirmed that the security scare at Geilenkirchen was caused by signs 'of preparatory actions for a likely Russian act of sabotage' using a drone, the Deutsche Presse-Agentur reported today. The tip-off reportedly came from an undisclosed foreign intelligence service.

Photo by Sascha Schuermann/Getty Images Sascha Schuermann On the other hand, an unnamed security source told Reuters that no drones had been seen in the vicinity of Geilenkirchen and that they could not confirm any evidence of a Russian role. 'The word Russia was never mentioned. We talked about a threat caused by drones,' a NATO spokesperson at Geilenkirchen told Reuters. The drone scare at Geilenkirchen followed a security alert the previous week, in response to reports of an attempted trespassing incident at the base. This came at the same time as fears of possible sabotage of the water supply at nearby Wahn Barracks. A full sweep was made of the premises at Geilenkirchen without finding any trespassers, while the Wahn Barracks incident proved to be a false alarm. While there has been no evidence of Russia being behind these incidents in Germany, they have all led to speculation about possible Kremlin involvement. This comes amid growing concerns of Russian-inspired aggression against Germany, including drones, but also involving various other ‘hybrid warfare’ tactics. Meanwhile, however, there’s no doubt that Germany — and its military bases — have been directly targeted. In April of this year, two German-Russian nationals were arrested in Germany on suspicion of plotting sabotage attacks, including on U.S. military facilities in the country. One of those individuals was accused of making plans to carry out bomb and arson attacks on military facilities and had allegedly taken photos and videos of military transports and equipment. The sabotage attacks appear to have been a direct response to the war in Ukraine, in which Germany has been a key backer of Kyiv, alongside the U.S. military in Germany, which uses bases there for transshipment, as well as training Ukrainian soldiers there. One of the targets of the sabotage attacks was the U.S. Army’s Grafenwoehr base in the southern state of Bavaria, where Ukrainian soldiers are trained to use U.S.-supplied M1 Abrams tanks.

Photo by Matthias Merz/picture alliance via Getty Images picture alliance In the wake of these arrests, U.S. military bases across Europe — including in Germany — were placed on a heightened state of alert, 'for the first time in a decade,' according to CNN. This move was said to be in response to intelligence concerns about possible sabotage attacks by Russian-backed actors. For its part, NATO has issued explicit warnings about the risk of an expanding Kremlin-backed campaign of sabotage, including cyberattacks. Speaking in June, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg outlined what he said was evidence of 'a surge of sabotage, cyberattacks, instrumentalized migration, and other hostile actions by Russia.'

Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images Kevin Dietsch TWZ has previously examined exactly why a hybrid warfare campaign might be especially attractive for Russia. Above all, this kind of warfare can be waged at a relatively low cost and with reduced risk — at least to the Kremlin. Undertaken in Europe, it would very likely be intended to undermine support for Ukraine by creating disruption and sowing fear. Especially important is the fact that, as long as proxies are being used, such activities are very difficult to be directly traced directly back to the Kremlin. Using relatively low-cost drones to cause disruption or even outright destruction of assets at air bases is by now a well-established tactic in conflict zones including the Middle East and the war in Ukraine. We have seen now even short-range drones, launched from fairly close to an air base, can have a significant impact. NATO air bases in Germany (and the United Kingdom) are also very poorly defended against these kinds of threats and regulatory/legal issues stand in the way of using available active defenses in many circumstances. A graphic showing elements of the United Kingdom’s Orcus counter-drone suite, as offered to the U.S. Air Force to help defend air bases and other facilities in England. Crown Copyright As for the situation in the United States, recent reports of drone sightings highlight what is very much a credible national security issue, although the situation there has been clouded by patchy government messaging and frenzied responses both from social media accounts and much of the mainstream media. With relations between Russia and the West still in a very precarious state and hybrid warfare very much in the ascendancy, air bases and other critical infrastructure in Europe could become the front lines of a new kind of war being fought in parallel to the conflict in Ukraine.

Army’s Dark Eagle Hypersonic Missile Finally Blasts Out Of Its La...	The U.S. Army has finally test-fired its Dark Eagle hypersonic missile from its trailer-based launcher, something it has been attempting to do so for some two years now. The service has explicitly blamed problems with the launcher for causing major testing woes that have pushed back plans to field the weapon system by years. The Army's Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office (RCCTO), together with the U.S. Navy Strategic Systems Programs, conducted the test launch from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, according to a Pentagon press release this evening. The missile at the core of Dark Eagle, also known as the Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW), is the same one the Navy plans to arm its Zumwalt class stealth destroyers and future Block V Virginia class submarines with. The two services have been working together to develop their respective systems. You can read more about the Navy's progress on its Intermediate Range Conventional Prompt Strike (IRCPS) weapon system here. A close-up look at the common missile fired during the first successful test involving the Dark Eagle launcher. A fairing of some kind is visible along the side toward the nose end. DOD 'This is the second successful end-to-end flight test of the [common] All Up Round (AUR) [missile] this year and was the first live-fire event for the Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon system using a Battery Operations Center and a Transporter Erector Launcher,' according to the Pentagon release, which does not explicitly say when the test occurred. A Dark Eagle launcher seen at a previous training exercise. US Army However, spotters were able to use publicly available warning notices, flight tracking data, and NASA camera feeds from Cape Canaveral to catch the launch occurring earlier today. Online flight tracking shows that one of NASA's WB-57F aircraft, a Navy NP-3D range support plane, and two specially modified High Altitude Observatory (HALO) Gulfstream business jets operated by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) were airborne at the time. All of these aircraft regularly make appearances during hypersonic and other missile testing, among other research and development and test and evaluation activities.

'This test marks an important milestone in the development of one of our most advanced weapons systems. As we approach the first delivery of this capability to our Army partners, we will continue to press forward to integrate Conventional Prompt Strike into our Navy surface and subsurface ships to help ensure we remain the world's preeminent fighting force,' Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro said in his own statement. 'This test is a demonstration of the successful Navy and Army partnership that has allowed us to develop a transformational hypersonic weapon system that will deliver unmatched capability to meet joint warfighting needs,' Navy Vice Adm. Johnny R. Wolfe Jr, Director, Navy's Strategic Systems Programs, which is leading work on the common AUR, added. The common missile, or All Up Round (AUR), being developed for Dark Eagle and IRCPS consists of two main components, a two-stage rocket booster with an unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicle on top. As designed, the missile gets the conical 'vehicle' to an optimal speed and altitude before releasing it, after which it glides down to its target at hypersonic speeds, defined as anything above Mach 5, and along a relatively shallow, atmospheric flight path, maneuvering erratically along the way. The Army has previously said the weapon's peak speed is at least Mach 17 and its maximum range is in excess of 1,725 miles (2,775 kilometers).

GAO A graphic giving a general breakdown of the common missile for the Dark Eagle/LRHW and IRCPS systems, as well as the division of labor between the Army and the Navy. GAO 'Hypersonic systems… provide a combination of speed, maneuverability, and altitude that enables highly survivable, medium and intermediate-range, rapid defeat of time-critical, heavily-defended targets,' a U.S. defense official told The War Zone after another test event earlier this year. 'The services common hypersonic AUR supports the National Defense Strategy and will provide combatant commanders with diverse capabilities to sustain and strengthen integrated deterrence and to build enduring advantages for the Joint Force.' While firing a missile from the Dark Eagle launcher is a major milestone, the fact that it has only come now underscores the problems that have been dogging the system's development for years now. The Army scrubbed three planned launches last year. The Pentagon did announce a successful end-to-end common AUR test in June, but that had made use of a different ground-based launch apparatus. A picture from the successful test launch of the common AUR in June. DOD 'The U.S. Army and Navy recently initiated a test of a conventional hypersonic system at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida,' a U.S. defense official told The War Zone in a statement in July, but offered no further details at the time. Thanks to today's Pentagon press release, which says the test involving the Dark Eagle launcher was the 'second successful end-to-end flight test of the All Up Round (AUR) this year,' we now at least know whatever happened in July did not involve an end-to-end demonstration of the common Dark Eagle/IRCPS missile. As noted, the Army has blamed past Dark Eagle testing woes on unspecified issues with the launcher rather than the missile. When Dark Eagle might actually enter service is still an open question. 'Based on current test and missile production plans, the Army will not field its first complete LRHW battery until fiscal year 2025,' the Government Accountability Office, a Congressional watchdog, said in a report released in June. Fiscal Year 2025 began on October 1. The Army had previously hoped to have a prototype battery start live-fire testing of Dark Eagle in Fiscal Year 2022 and field, at least on a limited level, in Fiscal Year 2023. The initial Dark Eagle unit – Battery B, 5th Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery (Long Range Fires Battalion), part of the 1st Multi-Domain Task Force (MDTF) – has already been activated at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington State.

Ryan DeBooy After the ostensible cancellation of the U.S. Air Force's AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW) program last year, Dark Eagle had looked set to be the U.S. military first operational novel hypersonic weapon. There is still some uncertainty surrounding ARRW status and there may be plans for a follow-on effort, if it hasn't already begun in the classified realm. The U.S. military as a whole has and continues to stress the importance of developing and fielding hypersonic boost-glide vehicle weapons, as well as air-breathing hypersonic cruise missiles, to ensure its ability to successfully prosecute various targets set on land and at sea going forward. These capabilities are seen as especially critical for success in a potential future high-end fight in the Pacific against China. There are also now plans for 'episodic deployments' of ground-based hypersonic and other long-range missile systems to Europe. The Navy hopes to begin at least live-fire testing of its IRCPS system from the USS Zumwalt, which is in the final stages of being modified to fire the missiles and just recently returned to the water after months in dry dock (as seen below), in the current fiscal year. It remains to be seen now if Dark Eagle's path to an operational capability is more clear-cut following its first successful launch using the trailer-based launcher, but it certainly is a good sign that the program can move forward toward fielding.

White House Says None Of The New Jersey Visual Drone Sightings Ha...	Federal, state, and local authorities have not been able to corroborate any claimed visual sightings of mysterious drones over New Jersey, according to a top White House spokesperson. In addition, authorities have assessed that many of the purported uncrewed aerial systems spotted overhead are actually innocuous crewed aircraft like airliners. At the same time, the U.S. government does not appear to have collected any imagery of its own of reported drones in the skies above the state and cannot conclusively categorize all of the reported sightings. All of this underscores The War Zone's previous reporting about how there may still be a credible national security issue unfolding, but the discourse around the situation has been blurred heavily by hysteria fueled by poor government messaging, as well as social media accounts and major part of the mainstream media that are propagating sightings of typical aircraft and labeling them as mysterious drones. John Kirby, White House National Security Communications Advisor, spoke directly about the reported drone sightings over and around New Jersey at a routine press conference today. John Kirby on drone activity in and around New Jersey: 'We have no evidence at this time that the reported drone sightings pose a national security or a public safety threat or have a foreign nexus&#8230; We have not been able to&#8230;corroborate any of the reported visual sightings.' pic.twitter.com/xfxFaJQUaN&mdash; CSPAN (@cspan) December 12, 2024 'We have no evidence at this time that the reported drone sightings pose a national security or a public safety threat, or have a foreign nexus. The Department of Homeland Security and the FBI are investigating these sightings, and they're working closely with state and local law enforcement to provide resources using numerous detection methods to better understand their origin,' Kirby said. 'Using very sophisticated electronic detection technologies provided by federal authorities, we have not been able to – and neither have state or local law enforcement authorities – corroborate any of the reported visual sightings.' 'To the contrary, upon review of available imagery, it appears that many of the reported sightings are actually manned aircraft that are being operated lawfully,' he continued. 'The United States Coast Guard is providing support to the state of New Jersey and has confirmed that there is no evidence of any foreign-based involvement from coastal vessels, and, importantly, there are no reported or confirmed drone sightings in any restricted airspace.' 'I'm not aware that we have U.S. government-produced imagery ourselves, but as I said in my opening statement, we have certainly done a thorough analysis of the existing imagery,' Kirby did add later on in the press conference in response to follow-up questions. 'The analysis, thus far, in an investigation that is ongoing, has not revealed any national security or malicious intent or criminal activity.' White House National Security Advisor John Kirby says the US does not have any of its own imagery of the drones over NJ and NY. He claims the White House is adequately investigating the drones situation and there is no national security threat. pic.twitter.com/y9OnJRbILy&mdash; UAP News (@HighPeaks77) December 12, 2024 What other data U.S. authorities may be examining in their ongoing investigation, beyond that collected using the aforementioned 'sophisticated electronic detection technologies,' is unclear. The full scope of capabilities being employed to try to detect and identify possible drones over New Jersey is unknown, as are how those assets as being specifically tasked in response to individual reports. It's worth noting that basic counter-drone systems use electronic surveillance measures to detect the radio emissions from drones to detect, classify and, in some instances, geolocate them. More advanced but common systems use microwave radars with the ability to also detect non emitting drones and provide better location data. All systems are often tied with an infrared/electro-optical camera system for visual identification and to help searching for drone targets, as well. 'I would remind you, we're at the beginning here, not the end,' he acknowledged. 'There's a lot more work to be done, and we're working closely with state and local authorities to gain more information.' 'I can also tell you that if the President, as Commander in Chief, believed, based on the information that he'd been given that there was a national security threat at play here, or even a public safety threat at play here, he would issue the appropriate directives to not only law enforcement, but perhaps even the military, if that was needed,' Kirby stressed. 'I can't tell you definitively. I cannot characterize for you definitively what these sightings are.' The DHS and FBI also issued a joint statement, seen below, today roughly to the same effect. Today, the @FBI and DHS jointly issued a statement on reported drone sightings in New Jersey pic.twitter.com/kzbmTzjvkr&mdash; Homeland Security (@DHSgov) December 12, 2024 Reports of possible drone sightings in the skies above various parts of New Jersey, which The War Zone was first to report on, have been coming in since November 18. However, Kirby's comments follow a particularly fever-pitched past 48 hours that included a member of Congress claiming on national television that the drones were coming from an 'Iranian mothership' offshore, as you can read in our past reporting here. The Pentagon had already shot down that particular assertion yesterday. There has already been considerable and clear evidence, such as the picture of what is obviously an airliner in the social media post below, that the vast majority of the reporting drone 'sightings' have actually been people spotting commercial aircraft and other completely regular air traffic over New Jersey. An avalanche of these videos and images have been spread on social media with ridiculous claims attached to them. Large drones have been hovering in formation over northern New Jersey, officials say, leading to 'unnerved' residents wondering what's behind these bright, unidentified flying objects appearing almost every night in the sky. NBC News (@NBCNews) December 3, 2024 Kirby's statements, although still guarded in terms of drawing conclusions, are clearly a meant to try to add some clarity to the malestrom of information swirling around in the media and on social channels. The muddled messaging from the U.S. government to date on the New Jersey sightings has drawn public criticism and push-back from officials, especially those within the state. As The War Zone's editor-in-chief Tyler Rogoway wrote on X yesterday: 'The main stream media has no clue what they are talking about on this issue, none, and most outlets largely don't seem to care. Local officials are very poor sources in terms of quality info on this issue. This is not a dig on them at all, it's just there is not an in-house knowledge base there that understands it, just facets of it, not anywhere near a whole picture. This is a very complex issue with many technological facets. You don't just call in a 'drone guy' and get briefed. We have ran into this issue many times.' 'The U.S. gov messaging on this has been so absurdly poor and frankly dangerous &#8230; but that isn't all that surprising. This has been the way it has been for years, but at least the denials have finally evaporated.' 'Nearly every video I have seen has pointed to mass hysteria not a drone invasion of massive scale, with airliners, private jets, and helicopters being portrayed as mysterious objects. These videos are peddled for engagement by a growing number of online accounts. This is very unfortunate, because there does seem to be something going on here, but zero critical thought, even on a most basic level of the 'evidence' only fuels rumors and fear. It also clogs the channels for relevant evidence to break through. This is true on a public consumption and governmental/investigative level. It also puts aircraft in danger.' Mailbox/DMs etc full of people asking why we are not reporting on the drone stuff considering we broke all this over many years. We are! But we have not been doing a play by play as the story has totally gone off the rails with reality and major news stories have developed…&mdash; Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) December 11, 2024 In addition, lawmakers in Washington have expressed their concern over the ongoing drone scare. 'As you know, since late November, communities in the New York City area and northern New Jersey have reported several incidents of unattributable drone sightings at night, alarming both residents and local law enforcement. According to public reports, residents have reported that some of these drones are larger in size compared to other commercially available drone technology,' Senators Cory Booker, Chuck Schumer, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Andy Kim, wrote in an open letter FBI, DHS, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) today. The four lawmakers, who are all Democrats, collectively represent New Jersey and New York in the Senate. 'Some of these drones have been observed maneuvering near critical infrastructure and sensitive locations, including reservoirs and military installations,' that letter, which called for additional briefings on the situation, added. 'In addition to potential privacy concerns raised by these aerial systems, we are also especially concerned about how these drones may harm public safety, especially given recent reports that a medevac helicopter was prevented from transporting a seriously injured patient for care because of the presence of these drones.' Kirby said he stood by his statement, including that there have been 'no reported or confirmed drone sightings in any restricted airspace,' when asked about this portion of the letter. John Kirby, White House National Security Communications Advisor, seen at one point during today's briefing. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images At his press conference today, Kirby was still quick to acknowledge that no matter what is or is not being seen in the skies over New Jersey, it highlights worrisome gaps in the U.S. government's ability to respond to ever-growing drone threats. 'While there is no known malicious activity occurring, the reported sightings there do, however, highlight a gap in authorities,' he said. 'So we urge Congress to pass important legislation that will extend and expand existing counter drone authorities so that we are better prepared to identify and mitigate any potential threats to airports or other critical infrastructure, and so that state and local authorities are provided all the tools that they need to respond to such threats, as well.' The War Zone has written extensively about the often obtuse maze of laws, regulations, and rules that govern who can take what kind of action against uncrewed aerial threats within the U.S. homeland and when. This topic just recently came to the fore again with the roll-out of a new Pentagon-wide counter-drone strategy meant to, in part, streamline the U.S. military's ability to act within the authorities it has already and better interface with other federal, state, and local partners. Counter-drone systems on display at the U.S. military's Falcon Peak 2025 demonstration event at Peterson Space Force Base in Colorado in October 2024. DOD At the same time, as The War Zone has been sounding the alarm for years, the dangers posed by ever-more capable drones are not new, and the U.S. government as a whole has been slow to acknowledge this and continues to lag in taking steps to address the threats. As we also highlight regularly there has been and continues to be substantial overlap in reported sightings of what are now often called unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and drones. Many purported UAPs have been later assessed to likely be uncrewed aerial systems. Overall, as already noted, the bulk of the U.S. government messaging to date on the New Jersey sightings has been, at best, muddled and has already drawn public criticism and push-back from officials, especially those within the state. Kirby's comments today, although brief, do offer important additional details about what is understood to have been going on over New Jersey, but many questions still remain.

Littoral Combat Ships To Sail With Mk70 Vertical Launchers Strapp...	In a significant step toward finally giving the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) fleet greater offensive capabilities, Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro announced Wednesday that 'many' LCS ships will receive the modular Mk 70 Payload Delivery System, allowing the beleaguered LCS to field the type of substantial firepower that has long eluded them. The Mk 70 is a containerized launch system based on the Mk 41 Vertical Launching System (VLS) in use on many American and foreign warships. It can accommodate a variety of missiles, including the versatile Standard Missile-6 (SM-6) and the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM). USS Savannah (LCS 28) conducts a test-fire of a SM-6 missile from a Mk 70 modular missile launcher in 2023. (U.S. Navy) Mk 70 will give the LCS fleet 'tremendous firepower and even more tactical advantage over our adversaries,' Del Toro said during the U.S. Naval Institute’s 2024 Defense Forum in Washington, D.C. Once billed as a critical multi-role component of the Navy's future fleet, the pricey LCS program has involved mission modules that were never fielded, as well as hull crack issues and class-wide propulsion problems that impacted the Independence and Freedom classes, respectively. Such ships have also had limited operational employment. Del Toro's comments this week suggest the sea service is bullish on what the Mk 70 can do to reverse the LCS's fortunes and finally get the ships ready for a higher-end fight, even as questions remain about the LCS's survivability if they are indeed dispatched 'aggressively,' as Del Toro noted. 'LCS is back, Freedom class and Independence class, and we have every intent to deploy them aggressively everywhere around the globe, and the Persian Gulf, obviously, with the mine-sweeping capability and everywhere else it’s needed, particularly in the Pacific with these added capabilities,' Del Toro said. USNI News’ Sam Lagrone was the first to report Del Toro’s remarks. TWZ has reached out to the Navy to get more information on the timeline for the upgrades, and which LCSs will be involved. Such a capability would allow LCS to fire smaller volumes of several types of missiles, and would be particularly important in a Pacific war with China, where larger surface warships outfitted with the Mk 41 would be in high demand. These vessels would defend against air and missile threats, and to help prosecute stand-off strikes against a large number of sea and shore targets. Del Toro’s announcement follows the Navy’s successful test-firing of a SM-6 missile from a Mk 70 launcher placed aboard the Independence class LCS USS Savannah (LCS-28) in October 2023 in the Eastern Pacific Ocean. The SM-6’s striking of a designated target 'demonstrated the modularity and lethality of Littoral Combat Ships and the ability to successfully integrate a containerized weapons system to engage a surface target,' the Navy said at the time. A rendering of the Mk 70 Mod 1 Expeditionary Launcher. (Public Domain) Savannah employed a form of the Mk 70 Mod 1 Expeditionary Launcher for the test, TWZ previously reported. In addition to the SM-6, the system can fire land-attack, anti-ship optimized and other Tomahawk variants. Mk 70 launchers are related to the U.S. Army’s ground-based Typhon system, which fires SM-6s and Tomahawks as well. The Navy has also test-fired a SM-6 from a Mk 70-series launcher aboard the experimental large uncrewed surface vessel Ranger, and has previously demonstrated such launchers in a trailer-mounted configuration during an exercise in Denmark. Lockheed Martin announced in May 2024 that it had successfully test-fired a Patriot PAC-3 MSE interceptor from such a containerized launcher and used it to down a mock cruise missile. A US Navy Mk 70-series launch system mounted on a trailer deployed during an exercise in Denmark in September 2023. (U.S. Navy) TWZ previously laid out what the Mk 70 would offer after the Navy announced Savannah’s successful test-fire: 'The Mk 70 family does offer a relatively simple way to increase the firepower on a wide variety of ships with suitable deck space. This includes smaller surface combatants with helipads like Independence class LCSs, various amphibious warfare, and certain auxiliary support ships, including commercial designs. The containerized launcher provides immense flexibility just with its ability to fire SM-6s and Tomahawks, and its Mk 41 VLS heritage means more munition options could definitely be integrated in the future.' The multi-purpose SM-6 can be used against a variety of air and surface targets, with some existing variants even able to engage more novel hypersonic threats , as well as traditional ballistic missiles in their terminal stages of flight, TWZ previously reported. An enlarged version of the SM-6 is being developed that is expected to offer greater range and hypersonic peak speed. The destroyer USS John Paul Jones (DDG 53) launches a Standard Missile-6 (SM-6). (U.S. Navy) Loading a Mk 70 launcher with Tomahawk missiles would drastically increase the LCS’s capabilities, allowing the class to strike land and sea targets within an area extending roughly 1,000 miles in all directions, which would help hold targets in areas with substantial Chinese defenses. The Tomahawks can also loiter over a target and have their target changed mid-flight. The Savannah test-fire wasn’t the first time we’ve glimpsed such a setup aboard a LCS. TWZ previously reported on a photo taken during the 2022 Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise in Hawaii that showed the USS Tulsa (LCS-16) similarly equipped, although the Navy did not disclose anything about the loadout or whether Tulsa fired any missiles using the system during the exercise. The littoral combat ship USS Tulsa (LCS-16) at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii during the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise in 2022. (U.S. Navy) Del Toro did not mention what sort of sensors would accompany Mk 70 launchers on a LCS. But for SM-6 and Tomahawk, remote sensor and targeting data from external platforms — including those in the air, at sea, on land, and in space — that is datalinked to the ship would likely be the most feasible option considering the LCS's limited sensor suite. This concept of distributing missiles across more vessels and locales and decentralizing their fire control and targeting has long been of major interest to the Navy. But strapping on other sensors is a possibility too. For instance, ship spotters picked up what appeared to be a trailer-mounted AN/TPQ-53 radar on Savannah’s flight deck when it left San Diego for the test-fire last year. That radar is primarily designed to spot and track incoming rockets and artillery rounds, and then determine their points of launch so friendly forces can launch so-called counter-battery strikes, TWZ reported, and it also has demonstrated an ability to detect and track drones. TWZ previously laid out what else such a radar, also known as the Counterfire Target Acquisition Radar, would contribute, including the improved ability of Mk 70-equipped ships to spot and engage targets independently, regardless of a ship’s built-in capabilities. It offers an example of how systems could be lashed to the ship's deck to help expand its sensor capabilities for tailored mission sets. Del Toro also noted Wednesday that 'numerous' LCS are now equipped with the Naval Strike Missile (NSM), an anti-ship cruise missile that is very capable, but nowhere near as flexible as the SM-6 or as long-reaching as a Tomahawk. The Navy continues to push ahead with plans to place the NSM aboard its entire LCS fleet by Fiscal Year 2032, Inside Defense previously reported. Go here to read more about NSM aboard the LCS. The Naval Strike Missile (NSM). (U.S. Navy) But while the Mk 70 launcher and NSM give the LCS fleet some added firepower, there are tradeoffs, as TWZ has reported: 'With regard to the Navy’s LCSs, it is worth noting that using the rear flight deck as a place to mount a Mk 70-series launcher and other associated equipment eliminates their ability to launch and recover helicopters. The service has long touted the ability of the ships to carry MH-60R Sea Hawk helicopters, as well as MQ-8C Fire Scout drone helicopters, as key to helping the ships find and engage targets at extended ranges, defend against close-in threats like small boat swarms, and just provide increased situational awareness.' An airborne MH-60R Sea Hawk helicopter. (U.S. Navy) Such a tradeoff would be a massive one for the LCS as its flight deck and embarked aviation capabilities are highly prized and greatly expand the ship's flexibility and independence of operations. Giving up that capability for just four missiles per Mk70, presumably at least three systems can be carried, is a big concession. It is possible that Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles (RIM-162s) could be quad-packed into each cell like they are on Navy Mark 41 systems. This would offer the LCS 16 missiles per launcher, but those would be used for self defense and up to medium-range area air defense, that is if the LCS's sensors can support their employment. The data-link equipped RIM-162 Block II could be key to making that a reality. It would give the LCS a massive upgrade in air defense capabilities and survivability in higher-end threat environments. The Navy currently operates 25 LCS, and it has decommissioned seven ships since 2021, including some with less than five years of service, a move that the Navy framed as a way to save money for investing in more promising systems. Will Mk 70 help redeem the acquisition boondoggle colloquially referred to by some as the 'Little Crappy Ship,' even as questions remain about how quickly the system can be fielded and the LCS’s survivability in a full-blown war? Only time will tell.

Drones Over New Jersey Show Signs Of Coordination, Elude Helicopt...	Apparent drones spotted in the skies over New Jersey, some as big as six feet across, look to be operating in a coordinated manner not consistent with hobbyists, according to claims being made by state and local officials. They have also evaded attempts to detect and identify them definitively using helicopters and other sensors. Major questions remain about the reported sightings, which have occurred every day since November 18, as The War Zone was first to report on. The ongoing situation has become a national cause celebre that is skirting the line between hysteria and real national security concerns, as you can read about more in our past reporting here. The New Jersey State Police (NJSP) hosted briefings at its headquarters for mayors and state lawmakers about the drone sightings yesterday. Other state and federal officials were also present, according to attendees. The FBI is currently leading the investigation into the current situation, but is coordinating with other entities, including NJSP, the New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness (OHSP), and the U.S. Coast Guard. It is also known that the U.S. military, through U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM), has also been engaged on some level, but has not yet been asked to directly assist in responding to the sightings. First Sightings: Reported on 11/18, with sightings occurring every night since then, from dusk until 11 PM (6–7 hours),' New Jersey Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia wrote in a lengthy post on X about what was briefed. 'Frequency: Reports range from 4 to 180 sightings per night.' I just left the New Jersey State Police HQ following the briefing of New Jersey State Legislators relating to the unexplained drone sightings in New Jersey. Might I add - @GovMurphywas not present. My notes are organized following my take below on the situation.1. We know… pic.twitter.com/kPnFGd5g5u&mdash; Dawn Fantasia (@DawnFantasia_NJ) December 11, 2024 It is important to note here that reported sightings do not necessarily mean something mysterious was actually spotted. As The War Zone has previously highlighted, much, if not all of the imagery purporting to show suspected drones flying over New Jersey, such as the picture in the social media post below, is actually of airliners and other normal aircraft that crisscross the state on a daily basis. Large drones have been hovering in formation over northern New Jersey, officials say, leading to 'unnerved' residents wondering what's behind these bright, unidentified flying objects appearing almost every night in the sky. NBC News (@NBCNews) December 3, 2024 However, state and local authorities have spotted what they have assessed to be 'large drones (up to 6 ft in diameter),' according to Assemblywoman Fantasia. They appear to 'operate in a coordinated manner' and are 'not identified as hobbyist drones,' she also said in her post on X. Federal and state authorities have also categorically denied that the sightings over New Jersey have been of craft operated by government entities at any level, Michael Melham, Mayor of Belleville Township, said in a video he posted on Facebook about the 'mayors-only' briefing he had attended. Whether or not they might be carrying any particular payload is currently unknown, he added. 'They operate in a coordinated manner. The lights are usually on and they're blinking &#8230; but they do turn off at times, making it very difficult to detect. They appear to actually avoid detection by traditional methods,' according to Melham. 'So when our helicopter, our state police helicopter, has gotten close, lights go off, and they go away. Makes it very, very difficult. We do not know and make and model. We don't know anything else about them.' A picture Belleville Township Mayor Michael Melham shared on Facebook that he took during the briefing he attended at NJSP headquarters yesterday. Michael Melham/Facebook 'NJSP deployed helicopters &#8230; but could not detect drones, even with infrared cameras,' Assemblywoman Fantasia also wrote on X. 'Suspended helicopter flights to investigate drones over safety concerns.' 'We have by far the most robust equipment is what the State Police told us. The detection equipment is up, but not detecting,' Mayor Melham said in his video update without elaborating on the systems in question. 'We usually pick them up on local radar' he added. The exact mix of capabilities that authorities are currently using to provide initial detection, and whether they are following up on individual reported sightings from the public, as well as how assets like helicopters have been tasked out in response, remain unclear. Considering nearly all the videos we have seen from civilians on the ground show mundane aircraft, they are not going to find anything once they arrive based on such reports. Regardless, spotting and tracking small aerial objects using infrared video cameras on another flying platform can be challenging, especially for personnel who do not train to do so on a regular basis. This all recalls an incident The War Zone reported on in 2021 where what was described as a 'highly modified drone' flying over Tucson, Arizona eluded a U.S. Customs and Border Protection helicopter that was tracking it on their FLIR camera system. Who may be operating the apparent drones or what their intentions remain unknown, but 'one of the takeaways today was that these drones statewide are hovering and appearing to be surveilling New Jersey's critical infrastructure,' Melham added. 'It was told to us that they know where they're at, they know where they're hovering, how long they're hovering,' but 'we have no idea where they're taking off from [and] &#8230; no idea where they're landing.' The infrastructure in question includes the U.S. Army's Picatinny Arsenal, as well as reservoirs and nuclear power plants, according to Melham. He also mentioned the Trump National Golf Course at Bedminster. As The War Zone has previously reported, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) enacted separate Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs) expressly prohibiting unauthorized drone flights around Picatinny and Bedminster in November. It is worth noting again here that Iran made a veiled threat to launch a drone strike against Trump while golfing back in 2021 and the regime in Tehran stands accused of actively plotting assassination attempts against him since then. A graphic posted in January 2021 on what was then called Twitter through an account tied to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei implying a drone strike against Donald Trump while golfing. The account in question was subsequently banned. via Twitter/X 'Multiple low-altitude aircraft were observed in the vicinity of one of our vessels near Island Beach State Park, New Jersey,' the U.S. Coast Guard separately confirmed to The War Zone yesterday. 'While no immediate threats or disruptions to operations were identified, the Coast Guard is assisting the FBI and state agencies to understand the type, origin, and intent of these aircraft and address potential risks to safety and security.' Significant questions about what exactly is happening in the skies over New Jersey clearly remain. While Melham said the briefing he received was very transparent, he expressed concerns about the handling of the situation to date. Assemblywoman Fantasia and other attendees have made similar remarks. 'We learned that 'no credible threat' is kind of, almost legalese. In a legal sense, if there is a known threat that they are aware of and they know something is going to happen at a certain time with a certain object to a certain location, well that is deemed a credible threat,' Melham said. 'If they don't know what's going to happen, it's not necessarily a critical threat. It's called a potential threat. So they are saying there is a threat potential, but they were saying that there are no credible threats.' 'They keep doubling down on, ‘There’s no threat,’ but they can’t find them and track them,' New Jersey State Senator Doug Steinhardt told the New York Post after one of the NJSP briefings yesterday. 'When people are saying that there is no credible threat, I believe they are saying they don’t know if there is one. That’s concerning.' This underscores the at best muddled messaging from federal and other authorities about the sightings, which has already prompted criticism and frustration. The lack of definitive information, or at times any new information, has contributed to increasingly fever-pitched statements about the situation. Exactly what quality of information and data local authorities are receiving or can generate themselves is also questionable. As The War Zone's editor-in-chief Tyler Rogoway wrote X yesterday: 'The mainstream media has no clue what they are talking about on this issue, none, and most outlets largely don’t seem to care. Local officials are very poor sources in terms of quality info on this issue.

But we have not been doing a play by play as the story has totally gone off the rails with reality and major news stories have developed…&mdash; Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) December 11, 2024 At the same time, as we have repeatedly stressed, the sightings above New Jersey do highlight real and still growing concerns about drone threats to the U.S. homeland, as well as to military forces overseas. The War Zone has been leading coverage of worrisome drone incursions for years now, including breaking the news about incidents at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia in December 2023, the Air Force's Plant 42 advanced aerospace development hub in California this past fall, and U.S. facilities in the United Kingdom last month. The U.S. military and the rest of the U.S. federal government continue to lag behind in responding to these threats, or even having coordinated ways to document and investigate sightings of what often blurs into the realm of what are now referred to as unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP). There continues to be considerable evidence that many purported UAPs are actually drones or balloons, and that foreign actors may be using those craft to surveil or otherwise harass military forces and facilities, as well as critical civilian targets, in and around the United States.

Northrop Grumman’s Mission Solutions Aim To Keep Fourth-Generatio...	Fourth-generation fighter aircraft continue to play critical roles in air forces around the world, even where operators are transitioning to more advanced fifth-generation platforms. The U.S. Air Force, for example, features more F-16s in its total force inventory than any other fighter aircraft type. The Viper’s future roadmap foresees it operating in an increasingly threatening battlespace and being tasked with tackling a multitude of complex mission sets. Faced with extended life-expectancy and a need to address current and emerging threats, fighters such as the F-16 are being heavily modernized in order to remain relevant, ensure their survivability, and to bridge the gap between what armed forces currently operate and aircraft types that they need for future warfare. 'Adversaries are advancing their capabilities at unprecedented rates,' says Jim Conroy, vice president, electronic warfare and targeting at Northrop Grumman. 'To maintain their operational relevance, the fourth- and fifth-generation fighter aircraft flown by the U.S. and international air forces need to consistently be updated with new capabilities over time.' A U.S. Air Force F-16C assigned to the 422nd Test and Evaluation Squadron. Jamie Hunter Northrop Grumman is continuously modernizing fourth-generation aircraft with advanced electronic warfare (EW), targeting and sensing capabilities for greater survivability, precision and resilience, while increasing interoperability across domains. They’ve developed, fielded, and iterated critical mission systems for the F-16 for more than five decades, and these upgrades have never been more relevant than they are today. Since the F-16’s inception, Northrop Grumman has been the sole radar provider for the F-16, and its electronic warfare systems have served for decades on the platform. 'F-16 operators rely on our deep-rooted experience to provide advanced capabilities that meet their future demands,' says Lindsay McEwen, vice president, combat sensors at Northrop Grumman. 'From mechanically-scanned (M-Scan) arrays to active electronically scanned arrays (AESA), and analog to digital EW systems, Northrop Grumman is no stranger to modernization, ensuring fleet sustainment and long-term operability for the F-16.' Spectrum dominance for the fourth-generation One key driver of modernization is the rapid growth in electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) warfare, where advanced electronic warfare and sensing capabilities are prerequisites for survivability and mission success. Northrop Grumman has addressed this need with their AN/ALQ-257 Integrated Viper Electronic Warfare Suite (IVEWS) and AN/APG-83 Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR). An image of a SABR during flight-testing. Northrop Grumman 'IVEWS was designed to give the F-16 capabilities on par with fifth-generation aircraft,' said Conroy. 'It provides both situational awareness and countermeasures, and its ultra-wideband architecture allows it to see and defeat more radio frequency [RF] threats.' 'SABR has been an integral part of F-16 modernization, enhancing performance and bringing agility to the platform with every variation,' says McEwen. 'SABR’s software-defined AESA technology requires fewer moving parts, providing reliability rates three-to-five times greater than traditional M-Scan radars. This translates to greater radar system availability and lower sustainment costs.' While each system is highly effective as a standalone capability, their designs are also fully interoperable, which means IVEWS is able to provide protection without interfering with SABR. For aircraft equipped with SABR, the addition of IVEWS allows for full lethality without compromising survivability. The AN/ALQ-257 Integrated Viper Electronic Warfare Suite, also known as IVEWS. Northrop Grumman Every mission begins with survivability 'With modern threats on the battlefield, it’s possible for a pilot to be in the weapons engagement zone and not be aware of it,' says Conroy. 'That is why it is so important for every platform to have robust electronic warfare protection against agile systems.' Recent operational assessment flight tests on two U.S. Air Force F-16s that have IVEWS permanently installed demonstrated the ability of IVEWS to detect such threats. During more than 50 flight hours, IVEWS performed exceptionally well against both airborne and ground-based threats in a demanding electromagnetic spectrum environment, Conroy added. Four F-16Cs seen flying during a training exercise. Jamie Hunter Critical for mission success, IVEWS provides a level of protection without interfering with the onboard AN/APG-83 SABR AESA. The two systems are digitally interoperable on a pulse-to-pulse basis, allowing for both IVEWS and SABR to operate simultaneously and at full capability during missions. In contrast, legacy systems used a blanking approach, which required one system to shut off briefly while the other operates – the electronic warfare system, for example, would be unable to detect threats while it is being blanked. Northrop Grumman has applied its expertise in ultra-wideband architectures to the other side of EMS operations – sensing via advanced AESA technology. Enhancing situational awareness to ensure air superiority In dense, fast-paced, air combat environments, where visibility is often drastically obscured, it’s nearly impossible to get a full picture of the landscape. A platform’s radar is the sole system that can pierce through the chaos. As the battlespace becomes more contested, modernizing fourth-generation fighters requires upgrading to the latest radar technology – AESA. SABR in production. Northrop Grumman 'Our industry-leading AESA technology brings SABR greater bandwidth to perform more accurately in hostile environments,' said McEwen. 'Its long-range detection, rapid scanning, and high-resolution mapping greatly enhances situational awareness, allowing warfighters to make faster and more accurate decisions.' Approximately 95 percent of SABR’s mode suite and hardware baseline design comes from Northrop Grumman’s highly successful fifth-generation AESA radars, including robust and proven electronic protection. This not only makes it a more sustainable and cost-effective platform, but the AESA software base enables interoperability with fifth-generation platforms, allowing real-time data sharing and collaboration. This is crucial in network-centric warfare where joint operations require a wider range of aircraft for mission success. Seeing farther with electro-optical/infrared systems To ensure pilots have necessary situational awareness and precise targeting capabilities throughout the spectrum, Northrop Grumman also provides the LITENING electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) targeting pod. LITENING has been in operation for 25 years with over 900 pods in service on 10 different aircraft types, now including the U.S. Navy F/A-18 Super Hornet. 'The latest variant of LITENING, known as Large Aperture [LA], has six high-definition sensors that allow the pilot to see targets and threats in color and in three infrared bands: mid-wave, short-wave and long-wave,' explains Conroy. 'The long-wave sensor will give the pod greatly enhanced air-to-air, passive targeting capabilities, and the best EO/IR situational awareness available to date.' LITENING LA provides fighters that are carrying the pod a capability which can be used to work in conjunction with the radar and other onboard sensors to better ascertain airborne threats at long distances. This means fighters carrying the pods are able to accurately identify and track even stealthy threats passively, making them better able to engage them with their weapons, at long range, without giving away their presence. A close view of the front end of a LITENING Large Aperture pod. Northrop Grumman Staying on track with jam-resistant navigation systems One threat pilots are likely to face in future conflicts is the degradation or jamming of GPS signals. Northrop Grumman’s LN-260M embedded global positioning/inertial navigation system, an upgraded version of the F-16’s current navigation system, is designed to enable aircrews to continue operations even when GPS is being jammed. 'The M-Code technology in LN-260M will give pilots a more secure, encrypted, and resilient, jam-resistant navigation signal,' says Conroy. 'This system independently knows its location without the need for GPS.' A Super Hornet carrying a LITENING pod. Northrop Grumman Maintaining fourth-generation relevance in the future fight Air forces worldwide will rely on the F-16 as a core component in combat operations into the foreseeable future. Ensuring these platforms can carry out their missions in concert with fifth- and future sixth-generation aircraft will require an ongoing commitment to maintaining the combat readiness of the fleet. By adding advanced systems that are affordable, small in size, low in weight, and efficient in power consumption (low-SWaP) and designed to leverage open architectures, fourth-generation aircraft are guaranteed to remain relevant over time. Northrop Grumman’s advanced mission solutions such as IVEWS, SABR, and LITENING are keeping the Viper and other fourth-generation aircraft secure, survivable, resilient and ready for precise operations in the complex conflict scenarios of the future, ensuring warfighters return home safely.

Ukraine’s SA-8 Gecko ‘FrankenSAM’ Adapted To Fire Air-To-Air Miss...	We have gotten our best look at a Ukrainian 9K33 Osa (SA-8 Gecko) mobile short-range air defense system (SHORADS) armed with the Soviet-era R-73 (AA-11 Archer) infrared-guided air-to-air missile. While other such systems have typically integrated Western missile armament on existing Ukrainian ground-based air defense systems — known as ‘FrankenSAMs’ — this one is notable for being a domestic initiative combining a Soviet-era SHORADS vehicle with Soviet-era air-to-air missiles. Close-up of an R-73 missile loaded on an Osa-AKM SHORADS vehicle. Come Back Alive Photos of the upgraded Cold War-era Osa were published by Come Back Alive, a Ukrainian foundation that provides support to Ukrainian Armed Forces service members, including purchasing arms and equipment and providing additional training. The photos show an Osa armed with a single R-73 missile mounted on a rail on the right-hand side of its existing missile/radar turret. While there’s capacity for another missile to be fitted on the left-hand side, this isn’t loaded in these views. In its original form, the Osa-AKM version operated by Ukraine carries six 9M33 series missiles in box-type containers, three on each side of the turret. Earlier versions of the Osa carried four missiles. Ukrainian 9K33 Osa-AKM systems on parade in Kyiv, before the full-scale Russian invasion. Віталій/Wikimedia Commons Otherwise, the upgraded Oka retains the usual fully amphibious six-wheeled BAZ-5937 transport vehicle chassis. Mounted on this, the turret of the upgraded Osa appears to have the same H-band elliptical surveillance antenna (shown in the folded position) and the J-band engagement antenna mounted at the front, which is flanked by a smaller missile tracking radar on each side. This is not the first time we’ve seen the upgraded Osa with R-73 missiles, with a previous, lower-quality photo emerging in the spring of this year, this time with two missiles loaded. At the time, it was reported that the modification involved adding the APU-73 missile rail (the usual interface between the R-73 and an aircraft pylon) and unspecified 'additional equipment.' Picture of a OSA Short Range Air Defence System using what looks to be R-73 missiles (Thanks to those here helping me ID it).A cropped version was originally posted back on 12/11/2023 ( pic.twitter.com/AaoPYwWspQ&mdash; Jeff2146 (@Jeff21461) May 18, 2024 The result was claimed to marginally increase the range of the SHORADS, compared with its original missile armament. The Osa-AKM, or SA-8B Gecko Mod-1, as used by Ukraine, originally was armed with 9M33M3 missiles that have a maximum range of 9.3 miles and a maximum altitude of up to 40,000 feet. The R-73, in air-launched form, has a maximum range of 18.6 miles against a head-on target of 8.7 miles against a tail-on target. A ground-launched application would have reduced range since the missile wouldn’t benefit from the speed and altitude parameters of the launch aircraft. In this case, it’s perhaps more relevant to look at the seeker range of the R-73, which would remain broadly the same for ground launch: 6.2-7.5 miles. While these figures seem to conflict with the claim that the surface-launched R-73 offers improved range over the original missile, it should be noted that the published performance figures for the 9M33M3 are very much under ideal conditions and in real-life engagements its range would be significantly less.

Photo by Libkos/Getty Images LIBKOS The program was said to be a response to the dwindling stocks of the original 9M33 series missiles for the Osa, which have been greatly depleted, especially in dealing with low-level Russian drones and cruise missiles. The Osa system is also used to deal with low-level fixed-wing and helicopter threats over the battlefield. On the other hand, R-73 missile rounds exist in much greater numbers, aided by the fact that important parts of the weapon — notably its infrared seeker — were built in Ukraine. As the standard close-range Soviet air-to-air missile, it was also issued to air force units in huge numbers. Today, it remains part of the standard armament for Ukrainian Air Force MiG-29 Fulcrum and Su-27 Flanker fighters. A schematic diagram of the R-73 missile. Public Domain According to the latest information published by Come Back Alive, the foundation invested over 14 million hryvnias (around $336 million) in the Osa upgrade project. Although it doesn’t reveal how many of the systems were upgraded, it notes that Osa regiments within the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine have received the upgraded systems. Adding to the flexibility of the system, the same launcher vehicle can be armed with R-73s or 9M33M3s, presumably also being configured with a mix of missiles if required.

Kuzmin/Wikimedia Commons In a major advantage over the 9M33 series, the R-73 uses infrared guidance, meaning it’s a ‘fire and forget’ missile. Once launched, the vehicle can move away from the firing position. Using the older missile, the vehicle needs to keep tracking the target and the missile, as well as sending guidance commands to the missile. The nose of an R-73 missile arming an upgraded Osa-AKM. The Mayak-80 infrared seeker was designed and manufactured by the Arsenal factory in Kyiv. Come Back Alive Also, as TWZ has discussed in previous coverage of the missile, the R-73 is a high-off-boresight (HOBS) weapon, with a seeker that can articulate in any direction much farther than a traditional heat-seeking air-to-air missile with a fixed non-HOBS seeker that stares directly forward. Aided by a helmet-mounted sight, the Archer can be launched in air-to-air engagements against targets with off-boresight angles of +/-75 degrees. This gives the R-73 the potential to be a particularly potent, albeit improvised threat for locking onto and engaging dynamic targets with minimal assisting sensors when used in a surface-launched form. Clearly, Ukraine has also developed a way of using this HOBS capability remotely to ensure this weapon is effective at all.

The Yemen-based Houthi militants, in particular, have adapted R-73s for surface launch against aircraft targets, and used them in combat, as you can read about here. While there are similarities with the FrankenSAM program, the fact that the upgraded Osa doesn’t require Western missiles — or other Western technical expertise — means that it can be undertaken entirely domestically. An R-73 air-to-air missile on display. Black bands on the weapon indicate an inert round. Vitaly V. Kuzmin/Wikimdia Commons While it doesn’t rely on continued deliveries of Western missiles, it’s conceivable that the Osa platform could also be configured to fire Western AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. These are fairly similar to the R-73, with the same infrared guidance principle. Examples of the Sidewinder have already been donated to Ukraine by its Western allies, for use in a FrankenSAM solution, although it’s still not clear what platform they have been integrated on. In the past, TWZ noted that the AIM-9 could lend itself to arming an upgraded Osa-based FrankenSAM. There is something of a precedent for this, with the Polish defense contractor PGZ having previously pitched a broadly similar Osa conversion with the European IRIS-T missile as its effector. Meanwhile, the first FrankenSAM system to be seen in detail in official imagery comprises a Soviet-era Buk (SA-11 Gadfly) mobile surface-to-air missile system armed with radar-guided RIM-7 Sea Sparrow missiles. However, the similar AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missile has also been provided to Ukraine and is also understood to be employed in one or more FrankenSAM versions. One of the first official photos of a so-called ‘FrankenSAM.’ It shows a tracked self-propelled Buk-M1 system which is said to have been adapted to fire the RIM-7 Sea Sparrow, a missile that previously provided point defense for numerous NATO and allied warships. Ukraine’s Operational Command East There is also understood to be a longer-range FrankenSAM that combines U.S.-designed Patriot surface-to-air missiles and their launchers with elements from existing Ukrainian air defense systems, which might include radars from the country’s S-300P (SA-10 Grumble) systems. Outside of the FrankenSAM program, it’s worth noting that Ukraine’s stocks of R-73s have also been exploited for surface launch from uncrewed surface vessels (USVs), better known as drone boats. Ukrainian USVs operating in the Black Sea have been seen armed with R-73s, to provide the USVs with protection against the Russian helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft that are increasingly being used to counter them, as well as to offer an offensive anti-air capability in the same theater. In May of this year, videos released by the Russian Ministry of Defense showed a Ukrainian USV armed with an R-73 coming under attack from a Russian Navy Ka-29 Helix-B assault helicopter. The USV performed some hard maneuvers to try and escape the Ka-29 but was eventually destroyed, apparently by gunfire.

However, more could have been lost because Oryx only tabulates losses for which it has visual confirmation.

Come Back Alive The camouflage scheme on this Ukrainian Osa-AKM suggests it might be one of those donated from Polish stocks. Come Back Alive Regardless, Ukraine clearly has enough surviving systems to make it worthwhile launching a multi-million-dollar upgrade initiative. Despite its age, the basic Osa remains effective and, within NATO, is in use with Bulgaria, Greece, Poland, and Romania. As we have noted in the past, any of these nations could potentially be willing to give up their Osa systems, especially if inventories were backfilled with more modern SHORADS systems. For now, the upgraded Osa will be a very welcome boost for the Ukrainian air defenses, with the ground-based air defense element, in particular, having been very heavily worked, especially in the face of large-scale Russian drone attacks that have struck across the country in recent months.

Plans For New Hardened Aircraft Shelters Notably Absent From New ...	Any plans the Air Force might have for new hardened aircraft shelters or other physical defenses at bases are prominently absent from a new infrastructure modernization strategy. This is despite acknowledgments that the service's facilities 'can no longer be considered a sanctuary' and that those facilities need to be better prepared to support operations 'even while under attack.' All of this comes amid a major debate that extends well beyond the Air Force about how best to defend key U.S. military infrastructure, especially from growing drone and missile threats, and with a particular eye toward a potential high-end fight with China. The Department of the Air Force (DAF; which also includes the U.S. Space Force) unveiled what is formally called the Installation Infrastructure Action Plan (I2AP) yesterday. I2AP puts heavy emphasis on modernizing and right-sizing base infrastructure across the United States and abroad, as well as improving installation resiliency against hostile attacks and natural disasters, particularly when it comes to their electrical power requirements. A picture of a new solar power array at Joint Base Pearl Harbor Hickam in Hawaii included with the I2AP rollout to underscore work already being done to improve power grid resiliency at Air Force bases. Photo courtesy of HNUEnergy/Joseph Cannon 'DAF installations can no longer be considered a sanctuary. To ensure competitiveness in a high-end conflict, DAF installations must be able to deliver combat power with enough speed and intensity to be decisive, even while under attack,' an introduction to I2AP says. 'From hypersonic technology to unmanned aerial systems to advanced cyber capabilities, our installations must meet these new challenges and effectively generate combat power.' 'Resilient installation infrastructure possesses the capability to sustain combat power projection by protecting against, responding to, and recovering from deliberate, accidental, or natural events that impede all-domain operations,' the new installation plan also says. 'They require an infrastructure foundation with near immediate ‘ability to recover’ timeframes and ensure that critical missions are capable of being carried out, despite facing threats or adversities.' 'In this current environment, the ability of our installations to be effective and project power is going to be the margin of victory in Great Power Competition. And we had better be ready,' Dr. Ravi Chaudhary, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Energy, Installations, and Environment, also said during a virtual talk yesterday on the I2AP rollout that the Air & Space Forces Association hosted. Great Power Competition is the term of art the U.S. military has used in recent years to refer to newly mounting national security challenges posed by near-peer (and even potentially peer) adversaries, particularly China. 'You take a look across our inventory, and you're like, well, there's a lot of concrete out there &#8230; Concrete scares our adversaries just as much as fifth-gen fighters [like the F-22 and F-35], because the ability to mobilize and the ability to move a force from point A to point B is going to require concrete,' Chaudhary added. 'And so when you look at what we're doing in Indo-Pacific &#8230; bringing all-new airfields like Tinian, couple other locations, and robusting places like JBER [Joint Base Elmendorf–Richardson], places like Eielson [Air Force Base], that's exactly what we need to do.' A satellite image taken on June 6, 2022, showing the beginnings of construction to expand Air Force infrastructure at Tinian International Airport. PHOTO © 2022 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION JBER and Eielson are both in Alaska. Tinian is a U.S. territory in the western Pacific that is part of the larger Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). The War Zone has reported in the past on efforts to expand air base infrastructure at these locations. Work on Tinian is explicitly intended to provide critical additional capacity to project airpower in the event that the massive and highly strategic Andersen Air Force Base on the neighboring island of Guam is put out of action for any reason. All of this makes the absence of any explicit mention of plans for new hardened infrastructure or other defensive capabilities more pronounced. As already noted, there is a major debate ongoing about the value of physical hardening as part of future base defense plans, which The War Zone has previously explored in detail. The Air Force has signaled some support for more hardened aircraft shelters and otherwise 'robusting' infrastructure as Dr. Chaudhary put it yesterday. At the same time, the service has also called into question the value of major investments in physical defenses. 'We are looking at things … [that] increase the survivability of the bases from which we operate,' Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin said at an event the American Enterprise Institute hosted back in October, according to Air & Space Forces Magazine. 'And then in the midst of a conflict, how we get the right equipment to the right place at the right time is not only a matter of protecting it with hardened shelters and maybe camouflage, concealment, and deception, but it’s also connectivity, to have that situational awareness.' 'There's two classic schools of thought for resiliency. One is armor and harden the heck out of things. And the other is go with diversity and proliferation,' Tim Grayson, Special Assistant to Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall, explained during a talk that the Air & Space Forces Association’s Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies hosted in July. 'And it's really the latter, you know, because what ends up happening is you can spend so much time and money and effort on hardening things that you start degrading your own capabilities. So without being able to go into the specifics, I think we've made huge strides of hitting resiliency, through tougher diversity and mass and quantity.' 'I’m not a big fan of hardening infrastructure,' Air Force Gen. Kenneth Wilsbach, then head of Pacific Air Forces, the service's, also said at a roundtable at the 2023 Air & Space Forces Association symposium. 'The reason is because of the advent of precision-guided weapons… you saw what we did to the Iraqi Air Force and their hardened aircraft shelters. They’re not so hard when you put a 2,000-pound bomb right through the roof.' Wilsbach is now head of Air Combat Command (ACC). A picture from a ceremony in 2020 marking the completion of construction of new hardened aircraft shelters at Kunsan Air Base in South Korea, where elements of the U.S. Air Force are forward-deployed. USAF Congress has notably pushed back on these positions, including in an open letter from 13 Republican lawmakers earlier this year that warned that 'in recent war games [conducted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank] simulating a conflict with China over Taiwan, 90 percent of U.S. aircraft losses occurred on the ground, rather than from air combat.' That missive did also acknowledge that 'constructing hardened shelters for all our air assets may not be economically feasible or tactically sensible.' The Air Force is also very actively invested in concepts of operations known collectively as Agile Combat Employment (ACE). ACE is centered on reducing vulnerability and increasing flexibility through the ability to deploy in irregular and unpredictable manners to a growing number of bases globally. New and improved Tactics, techniques, and procedures to camouflage those movements and otherwise deceive enemies are also part of the equation. It is important to stress that hardened shelters and other physical infrastructure are not answers by themselves to the multi-faceted threat ecosystem facing the Air Force. For the Department of the Air Force, broader base defense issues are also tied up in the 1948 Key West Agreement, which firmly delineated the service's roles and missions from those of the U.S. Army that it had split off from. Per that deal, the Army is in charge of defending Air Force bases at home and abroad from aerial threats. 'We know that, doctrinally, the Army has taken responsibility since the 1940s for air base air defense. We may have some questions on that,' Dr. Chaudhary said yesterday. 'We may want to enter in a broader discussion on what that's going to look like going forward, because right now, the threats are so localized and so tactical that we may want to have a broader discussion &#8230; and take on some of those mission sets going forward.'

US Army 'Frankly, I would be comfortable with the Department of the Air Force taking on the total defense/local defense of air bases as an organic mission, if the needed resources – human and financial, etc – were made available,' Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall had also said during a keynote speech at the Airlift/Tanker Association’s (ATA) annual symposium in November. As the I2AP strategy notes, all of this comes amid steadily expanding threats to bases across the U.S. military, at home and overseas, as well as to critical civilian infrastructure, especially from drones and missiles. Drones have become a particular hot-button issue amid a rash of worrisome and still-unexplained incidents, including incursions over Langley Air Force Base in Virginia last year and more recently multiple U.S. facilities in the United Kingdom, as well as sightings in the skies above New Jersey. The War Zone, which was the first to report on all of these events, has repeatedly pointed out over the years that the dangers posed by uncrewed aerial systems are hardly new and are still growing, and that the barrier to entry is low. The Pentagon just recently announced a new department-wide counter-drone strategy, which acknowledges these threats, but also underscores the U.S. military's continued lag in addressing them, which you can read more about here. It's worth noting here that authorities at Langley, as well as Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina, have already been looking into the possibility of erecting anti-drone nets or other passive defenses to help protect against uncrewed aerial threats. A graphic offering general details about sunshade-type shelters at Langley Air Force Base that might now be in line to receive anti-drone nets. USAF New and improved cruise and ballistic missiles, as well as novel hypersonic weapons, also present particular concerns for U.S. military bases globally. These are threats not limited to Great Power Competition, with smaller nation-states and even non-state actors increasingly fielding more capable stand-off missiles. 'I think we're going to start thinking more broadly about what contested homeland operations look like, and so look to something coming out,' Dr. Chaudhary did also say yesterday toward the end of his talk. 'Our Secretary [Kendall] has made a few statements on that, that we may be open to taking that mission [base defense] on in the future. So we're excited about this. We're going to talk about it, but, so, to come in the future.' So, more may be coming soon from the Air Force about its plans for physical hardening of bases and/or other defensive measures.

Coast Guard Ship Stalked By Unidentified Aircraft, Iran Drone Mot...	The Pentagon on Wednesday shot down a statement by a New Jersey Congressman that there is an 'Iranian mothership off the coast of the United States launching&#8230; drone incursions.' The claim by U.S. Rep. Jeff Van Drew came as more and more people are seeing things in the sky they believe to be drones, blurring the line between hysteria and real national security concerns. The War Zone was the first to report about the New Jersey sightings that have since reached a fever pitch in the national consciousness. At the same time, the U.S. Coast Guard has confirmed an incident with one of their ships off New Jersey that was followed by unidentified aircraft. 'Iran Launched a Mothership' Rep. Jeff Van Drew says very high sources told him Iran placed a ship in the Atlantic Ocean a month ago and appear to be responsible for the drone incursions over New Jersey.'This is a clear and present danger to the United States.' pic.twitter.com/RqXPDNvqwO&mdash; UAP James (@UAPJames) December 11, 2024 'There is not any truth to that,' Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters, including from The War Zone, Wednesday afternoon about Drew's claim, made during a hearing Wednesday morning on the FAA's budget. 'There is no Iranian ship off the coast of the United States, no so-called mothership launching drones off the coast of the United States.' I asked Pentagon Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh about Cong Jeff Van Drew’s assertion that the drones over NJ are coming from an Iranian mothership that he says left Tehran a month ago and that the drones are being launched from this mothership off the East Coast of the U.S.… Jennifer Griffin (@JenGriffinFNC) December 11, 2024 U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) told us it has 'no evidence or credible intelligence that any ship from either Iran or other known adversary is involved in any way with the recent reports of drone activity near the New York or New Jersey area.' The command was recently given the authority to synchronize the U.S. military's response to drone incursions. You can read more about the Pentagon's new counter-drone policies unveiled last week in our deep dive here. While officials dismissed the mother ship claim, the Coast Guard on Wednesday confirmed that 'multiple low-altitude aircraft were observed in the vicinity of one of our vessels near Island Beach State Park, New Jersey,' LT Luke Pinneo said in a statement. 'While no immediate threats or disruptions to operations were identified, the Coast Guard is assisting the FBI and state agencies to understand the type, origin, and intent of these aircraft and address potential risks to safety and security. We take any and all aircraft activity near federal assets seriously and urge the public to report any suspicious activity to local authorities.' The Coast Guard statement came in response to our questions about claims made by U.S. Rep. Chris Smith on Tuesday that a 47-foot Coast Guard ship 'was followed by between 12 and 30 of these drones as they went through the water — followed, right behind them.' Actual Jersey Shore:A Commanding Officer in New Jersey Coast Guard told Rep. Chris Smith his 47-foot ship 'was followed by between 12 and 30 of these drones as they went through the water — followed, right behind them,' Smith told FBI, DOJ & CBP officials today. pic.twitter.com/avbizOtblL&mdash; Matt Laslo (@MattLaslo) December 10, 2024 That the Coast Guard quickly confirmed unidentified aircraft flew over one of its vessels is in stark contrast to how the Navy handled drone flights over its warships off the southern California coastline. As we were the first to report from a response to our federal Freedom of Information Act query, the mysterious swarming of U.S. Navy ships off the Southern California occurred over multiple days. You can read more about that in our reporting from the time here. Though it denied the Iranian mothership claim, NORTHCOM is taking reports about drones flying over New Jersey seriously. 'We are aware and monitoring the reports of unauthorized drone flights in the vicinity of military installations in New Jersey to include Picatinny Arsenal and Naval Weapons Station Earle,' the command said. It deferred comment about what actions are being taken in response to those installations. 'U.S. Northern Command conducted a deliberate analysis of the events, in consultation with other military organizations and interagency partners, and at this time we have not been requested to assist with these events,' NORTHCOM explained. 'If these incidents require additional DoD assistance, the Secretary of the Military Department or relevant DoD component head concerned can coordinate with USNORTHCOM for an enhanced or increased response. USNORTHCOM, in conjunction with our interagency partners, will continue to assess further information and is prepared to respond when asked or should the situation escalate to threaten any DoD installations.' #USNORTHCOM Statement regarding reports of drone activity in New Jersey.

On Dec. 3 spokesman Tim Rider told us that 'Picatinny Arsenal Police Department did receive an unconfirmed report on Monday evening. Because it is an active investigation, please direct any further queries on the topic to the FBI.' U.S. Army photo Naval Weapons Station Earle confirmed to us today that there was 'at least one instance of an unidentified drone entering the airspace above Naval Weapons Station Earle,' facility spokesman William Addison told us. He declined to specify when the incursion happened, what type of drones, or how the base responded. The facility, located in Colts Neck, New Jersey about 20 miles south of New York City, 'is aware of the reports of increased drone activity in New Jersey and Monmouth County and we are actively monitoring the situation,' Addison added. 'We have received reports from our neighboring communities and law enforcement partners regarding drone activity near the installation.' The FBI, which is leading the investigation into the drone sightings, told us it had no updates on Wednesday In addition to the two military installations, authorities say spottings of drones above critical infrastructure including reservoirs, electrical transmission lines, rail stations and police departments have occurred. The issue of drone incursions has become so concerning that Congress on Tuesday held a hearing on the matter. Robert Wheeler Jr., assistant director of the Critical Incident Response Group for the FBI, testified that the bureau has few details about the incursions, which began on Nov. 18 over Picatinny and the surrounding area and have since spread all over New Jersey. 'The bureau is actively investigating the unexplained sighting of drone activity over that part of New Jersey, including proximity to sensitive sites and areas of concern,' Wheeler explained. 'We do not attribute that to an individual or group yet. I don't have an answer of who's responsible, one or more people that are responsible, but we're actively investigating.'

Phil Murphy told reporters that he has spoken with White House officials about the ‘very sophisticated’ drones over New Jersey. 'The minute you get eyes on them, they go dark… This is something we’re taking deadly seriously.' While speaking at an unrelated bill signing event in Princeton, Murphy noted there were 49 reports of drones on Sunday, mostly in Hunterdon County, according to The Associated Press. Murphy explained that those numbers 'included possible sightings and potentially the same drone being reported more than once.' 'This is something we’re taking deadly seriously. I don’t blame people for being frustrated,' Murphy said.

Responding to the spate of drone incursions, the FAA enacted two Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs) prohibiting drone flights without prior permission over Picatinny Arsenal and the Trump National Golf Course Bedminster without permission. The Picatinny TFR went into effect Nov. 25 and ends Dec. 26 while the one over Trump National was initiated Nov. 22 and slated to end Dec. 6, but was subsequently extended to Dec. 20 Officials at Trump National could not be reached for comment on Tuesday and have yet to respond to our first query when we asked about possible drone incursions over or near the facility back on Nov. 20. Drones can be operated over those locations in support of national defense, homeland security, law enforcement, firefighting, search and rescue or natural disaster response, as well as event operations and approved commercial flights, according to the TFR. Any drones violating the restriction are subject to 'the interference, disruption, seizing, damaging or destruction of the unmanned [aircraft]' by the Defense Department, Department of Homeland Security or the Department of Justice,' the TFRs note.

(FAA) In a statement, the FAA said last week it had 'received reports of drone activity near Morris County, New Jersey, on Monday, Nov. 18. At the request of federal security partners, the FAA published two Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs) prohibiting drone flights' over the base and golf course. It is unclear if any drones flew over the Trump golf course. 'We look into all reports of unauthorized drone operations and investigate when appropriate,' the statement continued. 'Drone operators who conduct unsafe operations that endanger other aircraft or people on the ground could face fines up to $75,000. In addition, we can suspend or revoke drone operators’ pilot certificates.' Trump has been threatened with drone attacks before. Nearly four years ago, Iran made a veiled threat of a drone strike on Trump with an image posted on social media. It depicted what appeared to be the shadow of one of Iran’s flying wing-type unmanned aircraft — designs that are supposedly derived, at least in its shape, from a captured U.S. RQ-170 stealth drone — some of which are capable of dropping small munitions, looming over a figure that seems clearly intended to represent Trump taking a swing on a golf course. That tweet, by ran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was in retaliation for the death of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani ordered by Trump. It led to his account being banned. You can see an image from the tweet below. This image in this tweet caused Twitter to ban the account of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in 2021. (Twitter sceen cap) www.twz.com Large drones 'have been hovering in formation over northern New Jersey, officials said last week, leading to 'unnerved' residents wondering what's behind these bright, unidentified flying objects appearing almost every night in the sky,' NBC News reported. In addition to the FBI, the Morris County Sheriff's Department is also actively investigating the aerial phenomenon, 'which has been an annoyance but not yet any kind of safety threat, authorities said,' according to the network. The image provided by a witness claiming to be one of those drones was in reality a commercial airliner, as you can see below. This has been the case constantly in reporting across the mainstream media space. Large drones have been hovering in formation over northern New Jersey, officials say, leading to 'unnerved' residents wondering what's behind these bright, unidentified flying objects appearing almost every night in the sky. NBC News (@NBCNews) December 3, 2024 Though the concern about drones flying over military installations and other sensitive locations is legitimate, nearly all of the videos and imagery TWZ has reviewed are of private and commercial aircraft. There is also growing speculation that many of these objects are UFOs, or what the Pentagon now refers to as unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs). However, a spokesperson for the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), the Pentagon office that handles these matters, told us that it 'received no reports of UAP in conjunction with recent drone flights or incursions in the New Jersey area.' There are a number of reasons why sightings are being misidentified. 'Nearly every video I have seen has pointed to mass hysteria not a drone invasion of massive scale, with airliners, private jets, and helicopters being portrayed as mysterious objects,' TWZ editor-in-chief explained on Twitter. 'These videos are peddled for engagement by a growing number of online accounts. This is very unfortunate, because there does seem to be something going on here, but zero critical thought, even on a most basic level of the 'evidence' only fuels rumors and fear. It also clogs the channels for relevant evidence to break through. This is true on a public consumption and governmental/investigative level. It also puts aircraft in danger.' Mailbox/DMs etc full of people asking why we are not reporting on the drone stuff considering we broke all this over many years. We are! But we have not been doing a play by play as the story has totally gone off the rails with reality and major news stories have developed…&mdash; Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) December 11, 2024 During Wednesday's press briefing, we asked Singh to tell us how the Pentagon views the legitimacy of many of these drone claims. 'The initial assessments are that these are drones, and potentially could be small airplanes. It could be a number of things that people are seeing and reporting. That's, you know, for the investigation to uncover, and so I can't speak to that more in terms of a frenzy.' 'I think it's completely right that people report these sightings and that there is an investigation into what they are seeing,' she added. 'But I think what's also important to remember is that at no time were our military institute installations, or are people ever under any threat, and if they were, of course, the base commanders have the ability to engage these drones if they do pose a threat.' There are several impediments, however, to defending against drones. Given current rules and regulations, the U.S. military isn’t currently interested in fielding kinetic and directed energy capabilities, such as laser and high-power microwave weapons, surface-to-air interceptors, and gun systems, for defending domestic bases and other critical infrastructure from rapidly growing and evolving drone threats. Instead, the focus is on systems that provide drone detection, as well as electronic warfare and cyber warfare, and other ‘soft-kill’ options, at least for the time being. You can read more about in our deep dive here. With so many agencies involved in investigating the drone incursions, the government's message has been muddled at a best. That's added to the confusion. When the drones first appeared over Picatinny, the military offered public comments. Then the FBI came in and provided no details. Elected officials began to fill the void, adding to the growing alarm to the point where Congress had to intervene. Now the Pentagon is involved. As TWZ's editor discussed in his X post earlier today, this has led to a major hysteria: 'The mainstream media has no clue what they are talking about on this issue, none, and most outlets largely don't seem to care. Local officials are very poor sources in terms of quality info on this issue. This is not a dig on them at all, it's just there is not an in-house knowledge base there that understands it, just facets of it, not anywhere near a whole picture. This is a very complex issue with many technological facets. You don't just call in a 'drone guy' and get briefed. We have ran into this issue many times. The U.S. gov messaging on this has been so absurdly poor and frankly dangerous, there is a story there we are working on, but that isn't all that surprising. This has been the way it has been for years, but at least the denials have finally evaporated&#8230;' 'But beware of the prevailing narrative and especially what you see portrayed on social media, this is now a hype train and everyone is jumping on, and many are doing so for the wrong reasons. I applaud those that are doing the opposite&#8230;' Mailbox/DMs etc full of people asking why we are not reporting on the drone stuff considering we broke all this over many years. We are! But we have not been doing a play by play as the story has totally gone off the rails with reality and major news stories have developed…&mdash; Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) December 11, 2024 The growing hysteria over this issue clouds the fact that real drones pose a significant national security threat. While the Pentagon has repeatedly claimed that there is no indication of a foreign connection to the drone incursions, a Chinese national was arrested earlier this week for flying a drone over Vandenberg Space Force Base. Yinpiao Zhou, 39, is charged with failure to register an aircraft not providing transportation and violation of national defense airspace, according to the Justice Department. Zhou was arrested on Dec. 10 at San Francisco International Airport before boarding a China-bound flight and is expected to make his initial appearance tomorrow in United States District Court in San Francisco. On Nov. 30, 'drone detection systems at Vandenberg Space Force Base in Santa Barbara County detected a drone flying over the base,' the Justice Department release stated. 'The drone systems detected that the drone flew for nearly one hour, traveled to an altitude of almost one mile above ground level, and originated from Ocean Park, a public area next to the base. Base security personnel went to the park, spoke to Zhou and another person accompanying him, and learned that Zhou had a drone concealed in his jacket – the same one that flew over the base.' After obtaining a warrant to search his drone, agents found 'several photographs of Vandenberg Space Force Base taken from an aerial viewpoint. A search of Zhou’s cellphone showed Zhou conducted a Google search approximately one month earlier for the phrase 'Vandenberg Space Force Base Drone Rules' and messaged with another person about hacking his drone to allow it to fly higher than it could otherwise.' Vandenberg is a key military installation, where ICBM and missile defense tests, as well as many other space launch activities occur, among other missions.

Those incursions began two days after the first Picatinny drone sightings.

Mark Kerrison/In Pictures via Getty Images These are just the latest in a long string of drone sightings over sensitive facilities and military capabilities. TWZ has been on the leading edge of covering this topic for years and has broken multiple stories now about drone incursions over key U.S. bases and training ranges, as well as uncrewed aerial systems harassing American forces off the coasts of the United States and making worrisome overflights of important non-military sites. A spate of drone incursions over Langley Air Force Base in Virginia in December 2023, which TWZ was the first report on, has now become a particular national cause celebre. The interest in these incursions is growing every day and statements like the one about the Iranian mothership drive the story to new heights, regardless of the accuracy. We will continue to cover these issues and provide the truth, in both fact and context, as best we can.

Inside T-7 Red Hawk Test Operations At Edwards AFB	The U.S. Air Force’s new advanced jet trainer aircraft, the Boeing T-7A Red Hawk, is deeply engaged in an accelerating and expanding flight test program at Edwards Air Force Base in California. The USAF’s need for the Red Hawk is acute, with aged T-38 Talons bearing a heavy pilot training burden as Air Education And Training Command (AETC) struggles to meet pilot output targets. The T-7 is designed to improve aircraft availability and it incorporates technology meant to accelerate training. 'The T-7A is a generational change over the T-38 that’s going to open up a lot of options for AETC,' says Lt. Col. Jonathan 'Gremlin' Aronoff, the T-7A Integrated Test Force director. A team of Air Force and Boeing pilots and engineers are working with the new trainer to generate sufficient data and confidence to endorse that the aircraft is ready for students and instructors to fly and that the Red Hawk meets contractual requirements that would green-light Boeing to commence low-rate initial production. One of the T-7A Production Relevant Jets, known as BTX-1, lands at Edwards AFB after a test flight. Jamie Hunter Delays in the T-7 program have compounded USAF pilot training struggles, as detailed in May 2023 by Andrew Hunter, the assistant secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. 'Due to issues discovered in the early development and test phase of the program, the Air Force is delaying its Milestone C decision to initiate the buy of T-7A production aircraft. This will shift the T-7A program’s initial operational capability [IOC] into the Spring of 2027. We are pursuing risk reduction activities to mitigate some of these schedule challenges,' Hunter said in 2023. However, significant progress is being made, with Red Hawks now flying with the Integrated Test Force at Edwards AFB, which is breeding confidence that the program is making good progress. 'Everyone here is eager for the test work so we can get the airplane to AETC as fast as possible. They need the T-7A and we want to give it to them as quickly and as safely as we can,' adds Aronoff. 'We definitely don’t have any excessive pressure on us, it’s very much about working methodically to get the Air Force something it needs, and everyone's being incredibly respectful of how we do that.' T-7A Red Hawk origin The Boeing T-7A advanced jet trainer was selected in 2018 to replace the USAF’s geriatric T-38C Talons, but the Red Hawk is already three years behind its original schedule, and is now planned to enter service in 2027. The original timeline called for Boeing to start delivering the first T-7As to the USAF at Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph, Texas, from 2023 to commence initial instructor pilot training, ahead of IOC in 2024, which is defined as being a 'fully fitted-out squadron of aircraft and training devices.' Boeing was awarded a $9.2-billion contract by the USAF in September 2018 to supply 351 T-7As and 46 associated ground-based training simulators when it won the T-X trainer competition. Initial flight-test work was conducted out of Boeing’s St. Louis, Missouri, facility using a pair of 'Production Relevant Jets,' or PRJs, that Boeing built for the T-X competition phase. Following the contract award, Boeing started T-7A production at St. Louis with a static test article (STA) and the first of five engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) aircraft. Boeing said in early 2021 that the STA would be complete in 'a couple of months' and that it featured a 'significant amount of instrumentation' that would allow it to be compared against the digital modeling and prove out the service life goal of 8,000 flight hours for each T-7A. Flight-testing at St. Louis with the two PRJs continued and revealed some widely reported handling issues, such as wing-rock at high angles of attack. Further delays have been incurred by the need to clear a wide tolerance envelope for the aircraft’s escape system, which is based around the Collins Aerospace ACES 5 ejection seat. Specifically, this relates to safe ejection for different aircrew body weights, particularly regarding lighter-weight pilots. While the T-7A was digitally designed and manufactured from digital models using a methodology called full-size determinant assembly [FSDA], this hasn’t removed the need for rigorous flight testing and certification to verify that the modeling and simulations are accurate. The all-digital approach hasn’t removed all development risk, and test work has required additional time to be allocated for re-visiting problematic items. Although the low-rate initial production decision date has been delayed beyond February 2025, a decision is still anticipated by February 2026. Edwards testing The first of five EMD T-7As arrived at Edwards on November 8, 2023. It was followed by a second EMD jet and one of Boeing’s two PRJs – taking the test fleet at Edwards to three aircraft by the time of TWZ’s visit in October 2024. 'Testing will continue until we feel we can give the end user a product that they can use,' said Aronoff. 'When the program office and AETC decide to declare Milestone C, that’s when they'll start building low-rate initial production airplanes.' 'We work for Air Force Materiel Command and the Air Force Test Center. Specifically, the T-7 Integrated Test Force comes under the Air Power Foundation's Combined Test Force. We have three ITFs under this – the T-7 ITF, the F-16/T-38 ITF, and the Emerging Technologies ITF.' The first T-7A Red Hawk assigned to testing at Edwards AFB was the second engineering and manufacturing development aircraft. USAF/Todd Schannuth Todd Schannuth 'Everything we are doing in T-7 flight test is based on proving the contract, proving out all the things that the aircraft is supposed to do, and that starts with safety of flight and building up the flight envelope – how fast, how far, how high. It’s about verifying that the airplane is doing the things it's supposed to do per the letter of the contract.' The flying at Edwards typically sees T-7As being crewed with one Boeing and one Air Force pilot, with all maintenance being conducted under contract by the manufacturer. 'We're very much hand-in-hand and integrated together,' explains Aronoff. 'We are the lead developmental test organization [LDTO] and Boeing is our partner, and we stay in lockstep with them. We make sure that when we're going to test something that they agree it’s something we should be testing, that the conditions are appropriate and that we're testing it in the correct way. It’s about making sure we are going after the right data in the right way to satisfy the contractual obligations to develop the airplane.' 'Currently, we are engaged in flight envelope expansion. We have one of the PRJ T-7s fitted with a spin-recovery parachute and we're using it to open up the high angle-of-attack envelope and fly the departure resistance type of flight testing,' Aronoff explained. 'We also have two EMD jets currently, one is instrumented for loads, noise, and vibration testing – opening up the structural envelope and understanding how the structure handles different maneuvers over time. This is about monitoring fatigue. We want to make sure that the engineering models for the T-7 are correct. We do that by measuring discrete test points – altitude, airspeed, and g-force combinations to verify that the model predictions are accurate.' 'The second EMD airplane at Edwards is our flutter test airplane. Think of the interaction between the structure of the airplane and the air around it. Think vibrations and the harmonics of the flight controls, and that's needed to open up the air speed envelope. We go to different altitudes and run flutter programs in the flight control system, which automatically shakes the airplane at different frequencies and amplitudes to try to excite a response. We can target specific amplitudes and frequencies that we are interested in and we can be very precise in how we gather data.' The second engineering and manufacturing development T-7A flies over Edwards AFB. USAF Bryce Bennett Aronoff says the T-7 work is the most precise flying he’s ever done. 'You have a control room of about 30 people watching your every move, and sometimes they tell you that what you flew wasn't good enough. You are trying something multiple times and they tell you that they need a cleaner set of data, but they can’t feel the turbulence, can't feel the heat of the mission, and they ask you to go do it again. That’s my job, to gather data for the engineers to verify the airplane is doing what it's supposed to do.' 'Right now, we're still very much building that safe envelope to operate in and flying with kid gloves. I need to be very precise in how I fly the aircraft. We’re talking plus or minus a couple of knots, plus or minus 50 feet, executing a certain amount of g, plus or minus 0.2g normally. Very tight tolerances, because we need as clean of a data set as possible. We're streaming that data in real-time to the control room so they can look at the squiggles and make sure it’s the right amplitude, the right frequency, and do real-time analysis. If it’s a good data point, we can move on to the next event.' 'With our high angle-of-attack campaign, when we do a maneuver, and see if the aircraft responds the way we thought it was going to respond? As long as it's matching our model, we keep marching along. It's when there's a slight deviation from the model we have to look at why it deviated to check that it’s within acceptable bounds. Our loads tests are conducted in the same way. When I pull 6g, is the g-distribution around the airplane matching the model? In flight testing we predict, test, validate. We predict results, we then go out and test, and then we validate the model that we use to predict.' The third EMD T-7 completed a month-long trial of extreme weather inside the McKinley Climatic Laboratory in Florida earlier this year and it's now back in St. Louis for technical order validation and verification. 'They're verifying that the manuals for maintenance are written properly and accurately. EMD four is being used right now to do some ground testing for a new flight control law that's coming out, and the fifth jet is still in production,' says Aronoff. A T-7A Red Hawk seen frozen in the McKinley Climatic Laboratory chamber at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, in early 2024. USAF/Samuel King Jr. Samuel King Jr. 'I really want to stress the partnership. We are together on this every step of the way, and drawing on Boeing’s experience and expertise that they have already built with the T-7. While the two PRJ aircraft did do a lot of really great stuff for the program, ultimately, there are changes between the PRJs and EMD jets, so we have to be very deliberate in our engineering mindset on how we develop the airplane.' Boeing implemented a number of modifications to the EMD T-7s to address lessons learned from the PRJs, and Aronoff is keen to stress that the current test effort at Edwards has earned a lot of credit for the work that Boeing did with the PRJs early on. 'The outer mold line of the airplane is essentially the same, but things like the onboard computers have changed, the software we're running is a little bit different and there are small changes throughout the airplane that are different enough that we need to verify them.' 'Manufacturing design is a very difficult time in flight testing, especially in developmental work because if you find anything wrong, you're generally going to have to stop, investigate, then come up with a fix before you continue,' Aronoff explained. 'So by nature of where we are in testing, we expect a slower schedule than anyone would really want.' 'No program has ever gone through testing on its original software. We're going to find things that need attention, and that’s our job. If I'm not finding things, I'm not looking hard enough. In general, there's always things in the operational flight program software that we can do better. The contract and the requirements are spelled out for us, and so we continue to iterate on things until it meets the contract requirement – that's the measure of performance.' 'Our duty is to get the airplane fielded as quickly as it makes sense to, so that it's safe. If you think, for example, of the worst instructor pilot and the worst student pilot combination ever, we have to make it safe enough for them. Yet we also have to make the airplane able to challenge the next Chuck Yeager, so it’s really finely tuned to suit the best of the best as well as those that need a little more help.' The changing world of military pilot training Military pilot training is evolving. Fighter aircraft have become easier to fly in some respects, but they feature increasingly complex mission systems and information flow. Holding airspeed, altitude, and heading is still important for young aviators, but the emphasis in training has evolved to include employing the weapon system effectively to help streamline the path to advanced front-line fighters. 'The T-7 is a very high-performance airplane. It’s very powerful with a lot of thrust, and it will be a great challenge for student pilots. I wouldn’t say that stick and rudder skills aren't important – they're extremely important – but they aren’t the most important thing that we need to emphasize in modern pilot training. One of the big elements that separates the T-7A from the T-38 is the ability to download mission system tasks into the cockpit,' Aronoff explains. 'Theoretically on day one of pilot training, a student could be logging onto a data link, could be setting up different screens and fighting that information overload. Ultimately, the end user [Air Education and Training Command] will tailor a syllabus to build the product, in this case the student pilot that they need. We are providing a tool that enables that.' BTX-1 and the first engineering and manufacturing development T-7A fly together over Edwards AFB. USAF Christian Turner The T-7A cockpit features a side-stick control column and a customizable large area display, or LAD. 'You can have up to four different portals up, including mini portals, and you can have a different format for each portal,' Aronoff explains. 'It’s extremely customizable, which is going to challenge the students in terms of managing all of the information. They will need to decide what’s important, and what isn’t. What size screen do they want, how will they use the HOTAS [hands-on throttle-and-stick] controls, or are they going to use their fingers, because it's a touchscreen display. How do they find the information they’re looking for, and what information do they want displayed at any one time?' 'The student can fly, for example, with a moving map on the right screen, a weapons display in the middle screen, and maybe a simulated targeting pod on the left screen. Will the display look like a Raptor display, an F-35, an F-16? No, but all the relevant data is there. That’s not to say the jet isn’t capable of doing that in the future. It just wasn’t a requirement for the T-7A to mirror any specific aircraft’s displays.' The T-7 ITF is primarily evaluating the T-7A from an Undergraduate Pilot Training, or UPT, perspective. The first step in jet training. However, it also has a keen eye on the future application of the T-7 in the follow-on introduction-to-fighter fundamentals, or IFF, which is being taken into consideration. 'Every time we fly the airplane, even now, we’re looking at how an instructor would employ it. Every time I’m in the back seat of the T-7A I’m thinking like a UPT instructor. We have a diverse team here with T-38, F-15, F-16, and F-35 guys, and as we test the T-7A we evaluate it for future profiles that we will tackle later on in the program, such as an introduction-to-fighter fundamentals profile, where a student and instructor will go and fly a BFM [basic fighter maneuvres] sortie, for example.' The T-7A is not equipped with a radar or targeting pod, and sensor data is synthetically generated in the avionics for training purposes, and can be shared via data link. The aircraft cannot carry any training weapons such as practice bombs and weapons employment in training will all be simulated. In fact, the only external store the T-7A is mandated to carry is a travel cargo pod. AETC is concurrently working closely with Boeing on development of the T-7A simulator, which will be an important part of the overall syllabus. Aronoff says that right now for every hour of live flying the team undertakes, it spends two or three hours in the simulator honing the different mission profiles. 'For all of the data-gathering maneuvers we need to fly on a sortie, we rehearse them in the simulator. At Edwards we currently just have the one simulator and we also make a lot of use of the Boeing simulator that they have in St. Louis.' USAF and Boeing test pilots are jointly undertaking test flights at Edwards AFB. Jamie Hunter 'One of the big things I always get asked about as a T-38 instructor is landing from the back seat of the T-7A. In the T-38 this is somewhat of a traumatic experience, with very limited forward visibility. I’m pleased to say that the T-7 tandem cockpit has much better forward visibility thanks to that stadium seating.' Breaking new ground Unlike the 1950s and 60s, when new military aircraft types were emerging with regularity, the T-7A program is one of the rare times in modern military aviation where a brand new aircraft type is being flight-tested. 'Almost every time we fly the T-7 here at Edwards we're doing something that's never been done in the airplane before. That’s exciting because I can say I'm the first person to go this fast or this high in the airplane. Some people look at me strangely when I tell them I'm really excited about putting this airplane out of control and doing departure suitability testing. We’re doing brand new developmental testing on a brand new airplane.' 'I like to emphasize that it can be a straight pilot training aircraft, where you fly and learn how to do aerobatics, learn how to land a jet, things like that. You can also tailor it in a live virtual constructive [LVC] environment where you have three or four actual wingmen with you fighting your classmates who are down on the ground in the simulator. The instructor can ramp up or down the scenarios, whatever the student or the training desires.' 'Fundamentally, the way we're going to produce pilots will change. They can learn how to turn on the radar on their first flight in the T-7 if they want that. Students that are doing well and flourishing are going to be able to move forward a lot quicker with the T-7.' 'Ultimately, it’s up to AETC to decide how they want to unlock all of these features, but with the T-7 we have all the right tools in place to dramatically advance military pilot training in the USAF.'

V-BAT Drone Has Proven Its Ability To Operate In Heavily-Conteste...	Shield AI’s novel vertical take-off and landing V-BAT drone is growing in stature, with steadily increasing orders, a new variant, and most notably with a recent series of successful missions flown over Ukraine. While in that war zone the drones were able to deliver reliable effects despite operating in the most dense electronic warfare combat environment in the world. V-BATs were initially tested in Ukraine in June 2024 to evaluate how they performed in the face of just this kind of enemy interference. According to a Ukrainian report the V-BATs were able to operate unhindered, even when they flew very close to Ukrainian jamming systems. A follow-up battlefield experiment in Ukraine in August saw V-BATs locate Russian surface-to-air missile (SAM) batteries before relaying targeting data back to Ukrainian forces so that M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HiMARS, could attack and destroy the SAM sites. V-BAT trials in Ukraine proved extremely successful. Shield AI The Ukraine experiments clearly demonstrated how V-BAT is able to operate in a highly complex modern battlespace, with its embedded artificial intelligence working hand-in-hand with its suite of onboard sensors. As a package, the V-BAT offers a relatively low-cost unmanned aerial system (UAS) capability with significant endurance that can take off and land nearly anywhere and can operate in cooperative swarms to tackle complex missions. These include intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and targeting tasks in higher-threat environments. Armor Harris is Shield AI’s vice president of aircraft engineering, where he leads the development of V-BAT. Harris came to Shield AI from SpaceX, where he was the responsible engineer for developing the propulsive landing capability on Falcon 9 and was also head engineer for the Starlink satellite constellation. 'In Ukraine, there has been a massive emphasis on a fourth-generation fighter capability in the form of the F-16, yet F-16s can’t get anywhere close to the front-line because of the surface-to air-missile [SAM] systems that are prevalent here,' Harris says. 'V-BAT is able to operate without GPS in a hostile communications-jamming environment. It can fly into an area, locate and identify targets, and fly missions way out ahead of fighter aircraft. Historically, the suppression of enemy air defense [SEAD] mission has been considered to be a role for fighter aircraft, but now we’ve proved in Ukraine that a V-BAT in the danger zone can team with a stand-off weapon such as HiMARS to execute the mission, which is a very effective strategy.' Shield AI's Armor Harris, pictured in the center. Shield AI The V-BAT’s ability to persist in areas where GPS isn’t reliable is a key part of its effectiveness, according to Harris. 'Part of being able to fly without GPS is about knowing where you are without GPS. If you're able to do that, you just need to refine that position estimate enough to generate target quality grids and tracks, and then pass that data back. V-BAT has a navigation system that doesn't require GPS, and a communications system that's able to operate in that highly jammed environment. We've put it up against the best jammers that Russia has, and it's been able to take those head-on.' 'We see a lot of small, one-way attack drones in Ukraine, but what makes V-BAT unique is that there’s nothing else in the theater that is comparable in its size category, that can be driven around in a truck, can launch vertically from pretty much anywhere, and carry sensors that are comparable with those carried on much larger aircraft.' The small drone with big missions Technological advances mean that mission payloads are shrinking in size. What 40 years ago may have required a U-2 Dragon Lady, or 20 years ago may have needed a large UAS to carry them, can today be accommodated by a drone as small as the 9-feet-long V-BAT. 'From a sensor standpoint, there’s a wide variety of electro-optical and infrared sensors that are carried in the nose of the V-BAT,' explains Harris. 'We can carry a couple of different models of Synthetic Aperture Radar [SAR] on the belly of the aircraft and a SIGINT [signals intelligence] payload that can be carried with antennas distributed across the aircraft. We also carry a wide area visual camera search system known as Visual Detection and Ranging, or ViDAR.' You can read more about Shield AI’s ViDAR system here. Shield AI has also developed a sensor payload known as Sentient Tracker, which combines artificial intelligence with Shield AI’s (formerly Sentient Vision Systems) moving target indicator. Its AI-enabled tracking allows operators to automatically detect moving objects within electro-optical (EO) or infrared (IR) full-motion video. 'During a recent demonstration, the Shield AI team performed a search over an area twice the size of Dallas, in about 90 minutes,' explains Harris. That demonstration enabled us to get an image file of every person and every single vehicle in that entire area. Comparing that to a moving target indicator radar image, for example, where you get loads of little dots on a map, with our system you get an actual image.' A V-BAT launches for a maritime mission. Shield AI The camera array on the V-BAT feeds raw data into a processing algorithm that's running onboard. 'The AI software sifts that data and downloads pertinent information to the ground station, along with the coordinates,' says Harris. This means there’s no requirement to transmit five different feeds of 8K video that would blow your bandwidth, you're just sending the things you really need to see. For example, you might see a vehicle driving down a street and with this system you have the resolution to decide if it’s weaponized or not.' 'While the V-BAT carries a smaller camera than some of the bigger platforms, and therefore it can't see as far, V-BAT is a one-million-dollar-class aircraft, so you can afford to procure and operate many more of them. Now you have a swarming team of four V-BATs monitoring that same area, which is a very powerful tool.' The V-BAT’s weapons capabilities elevate it from a versatile uncrewed aircraft system (UAS) to a powerful tactical asset. For example, in May 2023 during the U.S. Army Futures Command’s EDGE exercise, V-BAT successfully delivered a live glide munition known as Hatchet, a miniature precision strike weapon with GPS and laser guidance. This showcased its potential to deliver kinetic payloads with precision and efficiency. Configured with a 'belly bay' for payload delivery, and with a new generation of V-BAT being equipped with wing hardpoints for external payload carriage, the V-BAT offers the flexibility to serve as a long-range, reusable loitering munition capability, further enhancing its battlefield utility. Armor Harris inside the V-BAT production facility. Shield AI Superiority through mass Intelligent teams of drones are being developed to tackle a range of modern-day missions. A team of V-BATs not only offers a versatile range of mission roles, but also adds a level of survivability. 'There are three basic methods that we consider relevant in terms of survivability in a contested environment,' Harris explains. 'The first is to be faster than everybody else, which is what the SR-71 Blackbird did – it could outrun the interceptors. The west has also invested heavily in stealth designs to avoid a platform being targeted by radar, but that has resulted in platforms becoming dramatically more expensive over time. The third way, and part of the rationale behind V-BAT, is to be more numerous than your opponent.' Harris says if you can beat the cost curve, you can operate greater numbers of platforms, and therefore potentially operate in a denied environment just as effectively as the exquisite platforms. 'We’ve seen genuine realization that you can in many instances achieve the mission of a multimillion-dollar-class super exquisite aircraft with a team of much cheaper, more numerous, drones. Sure, some of them might get shot down, but those that survive will be able to complete the mission. There’s also the matter of getting them to where you need to launch them. V-BAT doesn’t require a huge airfield and doesn't need a complex refueling operation to get to where it needs to be.' 'In the Cold War it was all about mass. Then it evolved to be about exquisite capabilities. Now, the technology has evolved again, and we are right back at mass again, and that's really been enabled by autonomy. The fundamental limiters were cost and the number of trained pilots, and not wanting to put those highly trained pilots at risk. Today, with the ability to operate autonomous aircraft, it unlocks mass once again.' V-BATs ready to be shipped. Shield AI V-BAT on the rise Shield AI has delivered about 250 V-BATs to date, which are in service with a range of operators in the U.S. and around the world. In some cases they have replaced legacy unmanned intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) platforms of various sizes, and in others they have been used to establish completely new drone programs for customers. U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) and the U.S. Marine Corps have now been joined by the U.S. Coast Guard as a third domestic V-BAT operator. 'We will start flying with the Coast Guard in 2025,' says Harris. 'Operators are realizing that V-BAT is quite unique. It can do much of what an MQ-4 or MQ-9 can do, but they can launch it anywhere and carry it around on the back of a truck or on a ship.' 'During the recent operations in the Persian Gulf, the U.S. Navy has been launching waves of fighter aircraft, burning a lot of gas, operating fully loaded and waiting for Houthi targets to appear. They’ve been bottlenecked by the ability to find, fix, and engage these fleeting targets quickly, because they’re up against a smart adversary. The Houthis are popping up, launching, and quickly going back into hiding. You actually need a persistent, wide area search capability to pinpoint these kinds of targets fast.' 'We see the targeting mission as being extremely critical. If we can target, we can support a stand-off weapon as a far more effective combination.' V-BAT operations are highly automated, and Harris says it’s as simple as touching on a digital map where you want it to operate. 'We have settled on four aircraft as a V-BAT team, partly because of what we have seen during operations in the Red Sea. The Houthis have been able to down some of the larger drones, so four V-BATs give us some redundancy while being able to cover the same search area as a single larger Group 5 drone.' Shield AI's facility in Texas is the heart of V-BAT production. Shield AI The Batcave Shield AI manufactures V-BATs at its plant in Dallas, Texas, known affectionately as the 'Batcave,' and Harris says the company can easily build one V-BAT per day, and that the facility is capable of supporting a daily production rate of six-to-10, or more. 'We manufacture approximately half of the components in house and the other parts that are supplied to us are mainly machine parts, composites, as well as cast and forged parts. Our new generation of V-BAT that we are launching soon is the first to field a heavy-fuel [JP-5 and Jet-A] engine, where the previous engine ran on gasoline. From a logistics standpoint this will make a huge difference with integration to militaries around the world.' Harris says the new V-BAT iteration also provides fully autonomous launch and landing, which will be entirely without operator intervention. 'The current V-BAT requires a groundcrew to set it up, to stabilize it ready for launch, and to control it for initial take-off and landing. The new version does away with all of that, you can just stand it up on its small launch pad and literally press go.' 'V-BAT has a huge throttle range, which makes the powerplant pretty challenging to get absolutely right, because it’s a big beast to get vertically off the ground, but then once it’s airborne you want maximum endurance, that means burning as little fuel as possible while in the air.' V-BATs on the production line in the 'Batcave.' Shield AI The priority for V-BAT employment is to stay on station for as long as possible, which can be in excess of 12 hours. 'It actually wants to fly very slow, around 50 knots in loiter mode, but it can also dash at a faster speed,' Harris explains. 'It will also generally sit up at around 15,000 feet, which is a big advantage as it’s away from a lot of the ground threats.' 'The new variant is slightly bigger, and its take-off weight has increased from 130 pounds to 155 pounds. So, you can carry more fuel, more payload, and it has longer endurance. Having a lot more computer power onboard is also going to open up all kinds of missions that current V-BATs aren’t undertaking today.' The level of expertise and technological knowhow at Shield AI is a critical enabler of the types of advanced capability that the company is developing. It places huge emphasis on the quality of its engineers, who are working at the bleeding edge of drone and AI technology. 'In the U.S. over the last 20-30 years, too few talented young people in technology and engineering have considered working in defense. With the global situation, even a small percentage of these engineers could make a significant impact.' 'This is technology that drives the outcome of conflicts, making it critical to attract more talent to this space. At Shield AI, the best ideas win, whether they come from an intern or the CEO – it’s the ultimate meritocracy.'

Dressing For Success At 70,000-Feet Aboard The U-2 Dragon Lady	As the U.S. Air Force’s U-2 Dragon Lady spy plane enters the twilight of its career, opportunities to get a glimpse into its critical mission and unique mode of operations are becoming increasingly sought after. In the past, TWZ has reported on civilian photographer Blair Bunting’s flight into the stratosphere in the cockpit of a two-seat TU-2S and the spectacular imagery he brought with him back to Earth. Now, Blair has followed that up with an account of his preparation for that same mission, focusing on the life-support elements that are exclusive to the Dragon Lady. Blair’s latest account, which you can read in full on his website, brings to the forefront how the U-2 mission relies entirely on the pilot’s pressure suit, also referred to as the 'spacesuit' — and the broader life-support equipment — to ensure its success. The pilot of a U-2 Dragon Lady spy plane photographed by Blair Bunting, part of the series 'Photoshoot at the Edge of Space.' Blair Bunting Blair Bunting With a rare chance to ride in the cockpit of the U-2, Blair became well acquainted with the workings of the Physiological Support Division, or PSD, as he went through the long preparations for his flight at Beale Air Force Base, California. Eight months before the TU-2S lifted off with Blair aboard, the photographer was at Beale, getting familiarized with the base, the squadrons, and especially the spacesuit. 'On the third day of my initial trip [to Beale], I was required to don the suit and sit for over an hour working through how to drink and eat, and what to do when I needed to go to the bathroom,' Blair recalls. 'I put on a brave face, but the truth is, I was scared shitless.' As for the spacesuit — or full-pressure suit in Air Force parlance — this piece of kit really is remarkably similar in concept and design to those worn by astronauts. It is made of three layers of Nomex material and weighs 90 pounds. The suits are provided in around 12 different sizes, based on pilot body size, and are further customized with adjustable panels in the torso, arms, and legs. Each Air Force U-2 pilot has two suits, and each one costs about $125,000. A U-2 pilot photographed by Blair Bunting. Blair Bunting Blair Bunting Flying in excess of 60,000 feet above the Earth, a loss of cabin pressure could be fatal for U-2 pilots, meaning ‘the suit is life’ and its upkeep is the responsibility of the physiological support division at Beale. 'If the cabin pressure fails, a controller on the suit will inflate it to an atmosphere of about 35,000 feet,' Sergeant Hawley, a launch and recovery supervisor for the 99th Reconnaissance Squadron explained in a previous Air Force media release. 'If that fails, a second system will inflate it to about 37,000 feet. As a last resort, the helmet will create an atmosphere of about 39,000 feet. That’s a high altitude, but it’s better than 63,000 feet where they can’t survive.' A two-seat TU-2S Dragon Lady of the kind that Blair Bunting flew in. U.S. Air Force One of the Air Force's two-seat TU-2S trainers. USAF After all, at 63,000 feet, human blood will boil since there’s not enough pressure to sustain oxygen in the bloodstream. Nitrogen flows out of the solution, leading to decompression sickness, or ‘the bends.’ As well as the spacesuit, U-2 pilots also breathe 100 percent oxygen for one hour before the flight to try and rid the blood of most of its nitrogen, mitigating the risk of the bends. 'It was not on the flight, but rather the day before, as I was sitting in a pressure chamber testing my spacesuit one last time, that I realized how absolute my reliance on it would be,' Blair reflects. 'I was well aware of the extreme risk to anyone who had the misfortune of being ejected from a U-2. Yet, I took solace in knowing that because of this multi-layered suit, there would at least be a chance — although small — of survival should that situation become a reality. One of the images that came from Blair’s flight in a TU-2S, Other more mundane thoughts were running through Blair’s mind at this point, such as what to do if his nose began to itch at altitude, with no way to get within the pressurized 'glass fishbowl' encasing his head. Breathing exercises and mental meditations became an important part of his preparation to deal with these kinds of psychological stresses. Meanwhile, Beale’s Physiological Support Division was responsible for preparing the suit as well as the food and drinks and would also be driving Blair to the plane and strapping him into it, connecting his suit to the generators, and making sure the seal around his face was tight. In fact, so impressed was Blair with the PSD team that he returned to Beale six months after completing his photo-shoot flight. This next assignment was all about recording the work of the men and women in the background of the U-2 enterprise, but without whom its mission would be impossible. Blair trying out his fitted pressure suit prior to the actual mission. Blair Bunting For this next photo-shoot, Blair chose to document four of the key interactions that he had had with the PSD team in the run-up to the flight: pressure checks for the suit in the chamber, suit integration, the ride to the flight line, and stepping to the plane. It’s in the chamber that the U-2 pilot starts to breathe the 100 percent oxygen and it’s an impressive space by any measure. In a black-painted room the size of a house, concealed behind a foot-thick door, is a chair for the pilot. While being fed the oxygen from a yellow bottle, they are attended to by two members of the PSD team, wearing masks and helmets. The activity is observed from a control room, behind a thick pane of glass. In a stark reminder of the dangers of depressurization, a water bottle next to the pilot’s chair shows them how bubbles would course through their bloodstream, were the worst to happen. As for the suit integration part, Blair was limited here as to what he could photograph, due to operational security, but this portion of the preparation involves donning space underwear, of the crotchless type, to accommodate a catheter (or Urinary Collection Device). Next, actually getting into the spacesuit is a process that requires 20 people (plus a media team and assorted spectators from the base). Entering the suit is a case of ‘diving’ into it, 'folding forward and pushing my head into the main O-ring,' says Blair. 'While not visible from the outside, the feet are actually part of the suit and are then covered up by a secondary external boot.' A U-2 pilot is integrated into his spacesuit. Blair Bunting Blair Bunting 'Once you are zipped up (from the crotch to the bottom of the neck), you are walked to a chair that looks like a motorized La-Z-Boy on a platform. Along the wall are gauges, tubes, and headphones. On the armrests lay thin white gloves that will serve as a barrier between your hands and the suit itself. One of the members asks if you want your air conditioning tube on the top or bottom of your wrist.' Next, the helmet is put it on and locked to the suit’s O-ring to the suit, then the gloves are slid on and attached to the suit, and the visor is closed. 'Things move quickly. The chair is promptly reclined, and five or six squadron members dive in, pulling and tugging on straps, running through checklists, taking oxygen measurements, and adjusting the suit,' Blair adds. 'The realization hits you that the operating room you just entered is your own, and these people are here to keep you alive. It is as equally terrifying as it is inspiring.' A U-2 pilot during the ride to the flight line. Blair Bunting Blair Bunting The next image shows the ride to the flight line, in a truck nicknamed the ‘bread van.’ The pilot at this point is still hooked up to the oxygen tank and the van has two more La-Z-Boy-style chairs for the pilot (or pilots, for a TU-2S mission). A U-2 pilot in the ‘bread van.’ Blair Bunting Blair Bunting Finally, Blair documented the walk to the aircraft itself. At this point, the truck drops the pilot off outside a hangar, in which ground crew are already busily getting the Dragon Lady ready for flight. Understandably, Blair’s return to Beale six months after his own flight triggered his own memories of the mission and his own ‘stepping to the jet’ for an unforgettable journey to the edge of space. Earth from (near-)space. As recorded during Blair’s U-2 flight. Blair Bunting Blair Bunting As for Blair’s incredible flight, you can read more about that in his own account. By any measure, a flight in a U-2 is a vanishingly rare occurrence for a civilian. Now, as the U-2 enters the end of its long service, such opportunities are only becoming rarer. With that in mind, it’s all the more fitting that Blair has paid homage to the iconic spy plane in such a remarkable way.

Extended Range AIM-120s, AIM-9s Eyed To Meet Future Air-to-Air Mi...	The U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy could soon be tasked with exploring whether extending the range of existing AIM-120 and AIM-9 air-to-air missiles is one path to help right-size stocks of those weapons. Congress is pushing for a broader assessment of U.S. air-to-air missile inventories amid growing concerns that obligations in the Middle East and Ukraine are eating into key munition stocks that would be especially crucial for any future high-end fight with China. An entire section dedicated to 'Assessments of Inventory Requirements for Air-to-Air Missiles' is included in the latest iteration of the annual U.S. defense policy bill, or National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), for the 2025 Fiscal Year. The text of the bill, which represents a compromise between previous House and Senate drafts, was released this past weekend. Navy sailors handle AIM-9X Sidewinders aboard a carrier. USN If passed and signed into law, the new NDAA would require the offices of the Secretaries of the Air Force and the Navy to 'develop recommendations to adjust the planned mix of missiles, including an assessment of whether extending the range or capability of existing air-to-air missiles would better support combined combatant command requirements at medium risk' no later than April 1, 2025. The air-to-air missile section would also prompt the Air Force and Navy Secretaries to do the following: 'Assess planned deliveries of air-to-air missiles through 2029 and the total available missiles by type in each year through 2029.' 'Assess combined requirements for air-to-air missiles to support operational plans of the United States Central Command, the United States Indo-Pacific Command, the United States Northern Command, and the United States European Command, at low, medium, and high risk.' 'Consider emerging requirements for surface-to-air defense and collaborative combat aircraft and how those additional missions will affect inventory requirements for air-to-air missiles.' 'Consider the sufficiency of planned acquisition for air-to-air missiles through 2029 to meet operational requirements.' 'Consider whether continuing production of the advanced medium-range air-to-air missile [AMRAAM] program of record through 2029 would enhance available inventories of air-to-air missiles.' The Air Force and Navy currently have two main air-to-air missile types in their inventories, the AIM-120 AMRAAM and the shorter-range AIM-9 Sidewinder. The two services are working together on a new longer-range air-to-air missile, the AIM-260 Joint Advanced Tactical Missile (JATM), details about which remain limited. The Navy has also fielded, at least on a limited level, an air-launched version of the multipurpose Standard Missile-6 (SM-6) called the AIM-174B, which you can read more about here. The Air Force has also been exploring other new air-to-air missile concepts, including compact and modular designs, in recent years. The possibility of further extending the range of the AIM-9 and AIM-120 is particularly notable given that U.S. officials have publicly presented AIM-260 as being intended to meet the demand for increased reach in aerial combat. The Air Force has also said that the emergence of China's PL-15 air-to-air missile was a key factor in prompting the development of the JATM, which is expected to have the same general form factor as the AMRAAM. China, as well as Russia, have been developing and fielding other even longer-range air-to-air missiles, along with airborne early warning aircraft and other capabilities that could help maximize the effectiveness of those weapons. Increasing the range of existing missiles could be another valuable option. The stated goal had been to start fielding the AIM-260 JATM by 2022, but there are no indications publicly that this has occurred despite very active testing of the missile. Whether this reflects issues with JATM's development to date is unknown. In the meantime, the latest subvariants of the current generation AIM-120D already have significantly greater reach than earlier AMRAAMs and there has been talk in the past of extending the range of the AIM-9X Sidewinder. Improved rocket motors with highly loaded propellants have been cited previously as a possible relatively low-effort way to increase the capability of existing missiles. The War Zone has explored in detail how a short-to-medium range variant or derivative of the AIM-9X, specifically, could offer a substantial boost in capability. A US Navy F/A-18E Super Hornet with a full load of AIM-120 and AIM-9X missiles. USN Building off existing designs would offer the additional benefit of being able to leverage present production pipelines and supply chains. Depending on what changes are required, older missiles could conceivably be upgraded to newer extended-range standards, as well. At the same time, the other portions in the air-to-air missile section of the latest version of the Fiscal Year 2025 NDAA underscores broader concerns about present inventories and the ability to not only replenish them, but expand their size, in the coming years. As one of the other provisions highlights, the Air Force and Navy are, at least publicly, looking to stop buying AIM-120s entirely by the Fiscal Year 2028-2029 timeframe, which might align with current plans for the AIM-260. 'Up to this year, where most of the employment of weapons were really artillery pieces and short-range weapons, I had said not at all,' U.S. Navy Adm. Samuel Paparo, head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM), said in November when asked about whether U.S. military aid to Ukraine and ongoing fighting in and around the Middle East was having a negative impact on U.S. military readiness in his part of the world. Paparo's remarks came at an open event at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, D.C. 'Now, with some of the Patriots that have been employed, some of the air-to-air missiles that have been employed, it is now eating into [our] stocks. … and to say otherwise would be dishonest,' he continued. When it comes to air-to-air missiles, AIM-120s and AIM-9Xs have been expended in the course of operations to protect friendly warships and commercial vessels from attacks by Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen and in the defense of Israel. Ukraine has been making significant use of National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems the U.S. military has helped provide, especially in combination with the AIM-120. NASAMS can also fire AIM-9Xs. A US Air Force F-15E Strike Eagle carrying AIM-120 and AIM-9X missiles flies somewhere in the Middle East. USAF This latter point highlights the additional provision in the latest version of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2025 that calls for looking at how 'emerging requirements for surface-to-air defense' will have an impact on all this. The U.S. military operates a small number of NASAMS to help defend the airspace around Washington, D.C. The U.S. Army is also in the process of fielding a new short-range air defense system called Enduring Shield, the primary interceptor for which will be the AIM-9X, at least initially. That, in turn, will create additional immediate demand for more Sidewinders. There are similar questions about what increased fielding of the AIM-174B might mean for the SM-6 pipeline, which is already under strain. A rendering of Enduring Shield launchers firing AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles. Dynetics As the latest version of the 2025 Fiscal Year NDAA highlights, questions about the mix of platforms that will be armed with air-to-air missiles in the future, including Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) type drones that the Air Force and Navy are pursuing, are another factor in these deliberations. Plans to deploy large numbers of CCAs, which the Air Force already envisions arming with AIM-120s and AIM-260s, together with crewed platforms would increase the total number of air-to-air missiles required for any single mission. The Air Force's plans for a new sixth-generation stealth crewed combat jet as part of its Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative) are now extremely uncertain, while the Navy says it is pressing ahead in the development of a similar aircraft referred to as the F/A-XX. The Air Force has also laid out much larger concerns about the affordability of a host of top-tier air combat modernization efforts. There has even been talk about the possibility of expanding the aerial combat role of the forthcoming B-21 Raider stealth bomber to help meet future requirements. However the Air Force and Navy might choose to proceed, calls to not only sustain, but increase air-to-air missile inventories are only likely to grow in the coming years, especially in the context of preparing for a potential high-end fight with China in the Pacific. Missiles like the AIM-120 and AIM-9X contain high-end and often unique components that can take months or even years to procure, which puts additional emphasis on making decision about new developments as soon as possible. 'We should replenish those [munition] stocks and then some. I was already dissatisfied with the magazine depth,' Adm. Paparo said bluntly at the Brookings event back in November. 'I’m a little more dissatisfied with the magazine depth. You know, it’s a time for straight talk.' Congress looks increasingly poised to demand the Air Force and Navy look into whether extended-range AIM-120s and AIM-9X, as well as other avenues, could help address future air-to-air missile needs.

New Syrian Prime Minister Assumes Power Amid Airstrikes, Continue...	Syrian rebels selected a new caretaker prime minister on Tuesday as the nation remains roiled by conflict after the overthrow of dictator Bashar al-Assad. Mohammed al-Bashir assumes office on an interim basis amid ongoing fighting in parts of the country and as Israel and the U.S. take advantage of the post-Assad power vacuum in the form of mass airstrikes. Bashir is a provincial leader aligned with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the former al-Qaidi-linked group that led the lightning 11-day offensive that toppled Assad. He will serve until March 1, 2025, Al Jazeera reported. His appointment was announced after meeting with members of the old Assad government. 'Today we had a meeting for the cabinet and we invited members from the old government and some directors from the administration in Idlib and its surrounding areas, in order to facilitate all the necessary works for the next two months until we have a constitutional system to be able to serve the Syrian people,' he told Al Jazeera.

Zelin (@azelin) December 10, 2024 Bashir headed the Syrian Salvation Government (SSG) in Idlib province before the rebel offensive and has close ties to HTS. A Facebook page of the rebel administration says 'al-Bashir was trained as an electrical engineer, later received a degree in sharia and law, and has also held posts in education,' Al Jazeera explained. HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Julani met outgoing Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi al-Jalali on Monday to discuss the transition to a caretaker government. However, the peace Syria will need to establish a cohesive, inclusive government seems elusive. Israel on Tuesday said it had largely completed its campaign of air and naval strikes on Syria’s air defenses, missiles and ships it dubbed internally 'Bashan Arrow.' However, Jerusalem has created what Defense Minister Israel Katz said on Tuesday was a 'sterile buffer zone' with ground troops in Syria. He later said it would be a temporary presence, though he offered no end date to the operation.

It is a roughly 400-square-kilometer (155-square-mile) section of the Golan Heights that was established after the 1973 Mideast war. The push marks Israel’s first overt entry into Syrian territory since then. New reports emerged on Tuesday claiming that Israeli forces in Syria 'have reached about 25 kilometers (16 miles) southwest of Damascus,' The Jerusalem Post reported on Tuesday, citing two regional security sources and one Syrian security source. 'The Syrian security source said Israeli troops reached Qatana, which is 10 kilometers into Syrian territory east of a demilitarized zone (DMZ) separating Israeli-occupied Golan Heights from Syria,' the publication reported. Israeli officials denied those claims, saying that they are 'completely incorrect. IDF forces are present inside the buffer zone and at defensive points close to the border in order to protect the Israeli border.' Like Katz, the IDF spokesmen offered no timeline for when Israel will withdraw its ground forces from Syria. The reports circulating in the media about the alleged advancement of Israeli tanks towards Damascus are false.

Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia have condemned Israel’s incursion, accusing it of exploiting the disarray in Syria and violating international law, The Associated Press reported. Turkey, a major backer of anti-Assad forces, also condemned Israel’s advance. The Turkish Foreign Ministry accused Israel of 'displaying a mentality of an occupier' at a time when the possibility of peace and stability had emerged in Syria. On Monday, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Israel’s incursion constitutes a violation of the 1974 disengagement agreement and called on both Israel and Syria to uphold it. Meanwhile, Israel released new details and video on Tuesday of its air and naval offensive against the remnants of Assad’s military. 'Within the last 48 hours, the IDF struck most of the strategic weapons stockpiles in Syria, preventing them from falling into the hands of terrorist elements,' the IDF said on Telegram. IAF and the Israeli Navy carried out 'over 350 strikes during the operation,' Times of Israel military reporter Emanuel Fabian stated on Twitter. The military estimates that it destroyed '70-80% of the former Assad regime's strategic weapons,' he reported. 'The waves of airstrikes carried out by IAF fighter jets and drones hit Syrian air defense systems, airbases, weapon depots, and weapon production sites in Damascus, Homs, Tartus, Latakia, and Palmyra,' he explained, 'The IDF says the airstrikes destroyed many long-range projectiles, Scud missiles, cruise missiles, coast-to-sea missiles, air defense missiles, fighter jets, helicopters, radars, tanks, hangars, and more. The Israeli Navy's strikes at the Minet el-Beida bay and Latakia port on the Syrian coast destroyed 15 Syrian naval vessels.' You can read more about the Navy's assault in our story here.

'Turkish proxies, with support from Turkish airstrikes, advanced today toward the town of Kobani,' AL Monitor reported. 'They began their push after seizing control of Karakozak, a bridge that connects the western and eastern banks of the Euphrates River, despite fierce resistance from Kurdish forces.' The attacks come as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan renewed vows to crush 'terrorist organizations such as ISIS and the [Kurdish Workers Party] PKK/PYD in other parts of the country as soon as possible,' AL Monitor explained.

How long that ceasefire holds remains to be seen. Fighting rages on between Turks and Kurds in the northern Syrian town of Kobani. (Google Earth image) In addition to the fights up north, ISIS continues to present a deadly threat. The terror group's cells 'executed 54 members of regime forces near Kaziya in Al-Sukhna area in Homs Desert,' SOHR reported. The ISIS cells also arrested members who fled from the military service in the desert and Deir Ezzor after the regime of Al-Assad fell, according to SOHR. As we previously reported, over the weekend, the U.S. launched a massive series of airstrikes against ISIS, hitting over 75 targets using multiple U.S. Air Force assets, including B-52s, F-15s, and A-10s, according to U.S. Central Command. Deeply disturbing: 'Islamic State forces on Tuesday killed 54 people in the Homs region in central Syria who had been part of the Syrian government’s military and fled during the collapse of the Assad regime,' says the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights. Kenneth Roth (@KenRoth) December 10, 2024 Claims are now emerging about how Assad fled the country with a fortune. We recently told you about Assad's massive bunker and huge car collection, riches he amassed while his people starved. Now that he is supposedly in Russia, claims have emerged that Assad transferred $135 billion in assets during his escape, the Turkish Turkiye Gazetesi news outlet reported on Tuesday. 'The Assad family transferred the nation’s resources into their own pockets during the years of civil war,' former intelligence officer Khalid Beyye told the publication. 'As the regime collapsed, they took a large portion of the country’s economy with them.' The former Syrian dictator's flight to Moscow spurred the mocking ire of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whose country is defending a nearly three-year-old full-on invasion by Russia that contributed to Assad's demise. 'The 'brave' Assad ran away to Putin,' Zelensky chided on Twitter. 'Where will Putin run away?&#8230;Assad and Putin are more than just vassal and lord. They are accomplices in violence.

Tice, a Marine veteran and freelance journalist, disappeared on Aug. 14, 2012, while he was reporting on the Syrian civil war. Weeks later, a short video appeared online that showed a distressed Tice blindfolded with his apparent captors. It was the last time he was seen. President Joe Biden expressed optimism that Tice could be returned to the U.S. in the wake of Assad's fall. 'We think we can get him back, but we have no direct evidence of that yet,' Biden said at the White House Sunday. 'We have to identify where he is.' Biden previously said the U.S. knows 'with certainty that he has been held by the Syrian regime.' On Tuesday, White House National Security Advisor John Kirby cautioned that the U.S. 'has no additional information on Austin Tice.' 'This development could present an opportunity for us to glean more information about him, his whereabouts, his condition, but as you and I are speaking here this morning, I can't report that we have any additional context,' Kirby told reporters, including from The War Zone, at a press briefing.

Su-57 Felon’s Two-Dimensional Thrust-Vectoring Engine Nozzle Brea...	Imagery has appeared showing Russia’s Sukhoi Su-57 Felon advanced fighter fitted with a new type of thrust-vectoring engine nozzle. The radical-looking exhaust design is intended to improve the low-observable features of the Felon, although the future of the new nozzle is far from certain. The videos and photos show the rear aspect of the second flying prototype for the Su-57 program, T-50-2, which was first flown in March 2011. It was subsequently used to test the improved AL-51F-1 (also known as izdeliye 30) turbofan, which was first flown in December 2017 — with just one of the engines installed in the aircraft, alongside one of the original AL-41F-1s. Video soon according to secretprojects forum user QuadroFX pic.twitter.com/MTIs0FjAaK&mdash; Fighterman_FFRC (@Fighterman_FFRC) December 10, 2024 What’s notable about the turbofan seen fitted in the left engine nacelle of the T-50-2 is its nozzle, which is an example of the new flattened version that is intended to equip the AL-51F1 once it’s installed in the improved Su-57M version of the fighter. So far, no orders have been placed for this variant of the aircraft. Another view of the flat version of the nozzle for the AL-51F1 (in the left engine nacelle), alongside the original three-dimensional version (right nacelle). via X The AL-51F-1 was developed as a ‘clean-sheet’ design, intended to offer increased thrust, lighter weight, and lower operating costs compared with the previous AL-41F-1. Another drawback of the earlier engine is its inability to provide the Su-57 with supercruise performance — flying over Mach 1.0 for sustained periods without using afterburners. At this point, it’s worth looking at the AL-41F-1, the original engine for the baseline Su-57, and its nozzle configuration. This turbofan is also used, in a simplified form, in the Su-35 Flanker multirole fighter. The AL-41F-1 (also known as izdeliye 117) was produced by modernizing the existing AL-31F engine used in the earlier Su-27 and Su-30 Flanker series fighters.

This is also known as three-dimensional thrust vectoring and provides pitch, yaw, and roll control. In its initial form, the AL-51F-1 also retains a similar three-dimensional thrust vectoring nozzle, but what we see in the new imagery is an alternative nozzle, this time of the two-dimensional type, which provide pitch control as well as limited roll control if engaged asymmetrically. It isn't clear if the angled installation of the nozzle is meant to provide extra control in the latter. The original three-dimensional thrust-vectoring nozzle for the Su-57, seen top, compared with the new nozzle of the two-dimensional type, seen below. via X This kind of stealthy ‘flat’ engine nozzle is also used on the F-22 Raptor, for example, and is primarily chosen to reduce radar signature compared with an axisymmetric nozzle design. It also provides infrared signature advantages, as well. A close-up view of F-22's distinctive thrust vectoring exhaust nozzles in action. Their unique 'hemispherical design' enhances F-22's stealth, even from the rear. In fact, it's said that not even the F-35 can match the F-22's rearward stealth capabilities. pic.twitter.com/9NHC8DECZQ&mdash; Air Power (@RealAirPower1) September 16, 2024 According to Yevgeny Marchukov, CEO of the Arkhip Lyulka Design Bureau responsible for the AL-51F-1, in comments reported by Aviation Week, Sukhoi was not interested in using a flat nozzle for the Su-57 when that program was launched. Only later was the two-dimensional nozzle ordered, after the Su-57 and the AL-51F-1 were flying. Since Sukhoi 'resists changes to the airframe itself,' Marchukov explained, 'That’s why we came up with a rather complex flat nozzle.' As seen in the diagram below, the nozzle has four independently controlled flaps, which work by modifying the air outlet cross-section and thrust vector. Of these flaps, which are installed at an angle, two are reportedly tailored for use in the subsonic regime and two for supersonic flight. The images also appear to show the vectoring flaps being vented, which, when combined with air forced through these areas, would help cool the exhaust and lower the aircraft's infrared signature. Two diagrams of the new nozzle from a company brochure. via X Speaking in the summer of 2023, Marchukov confirmed that the new nozzle had been successfully run on a ground testbed, including with afterburning. He added that a first flight was expected before the end of 2023, although there’s no record of whether that ever happened. For the Su-57, the flat nozzle would bring notable advantages in terms of improving its low observability from the rear aspect. The original design of the Felon optimized low observability from the frontal aspect, with less attention paid to the side and rear aspects. At the same time, the revised nozzles will reduce thrust output to some degree, but this is clearly considered a worthwhile penalty based on the improved low-observable aspects it brings, which are badly needed for the type. It’s also worth noting that another flat nozzle design has been developed for the version of the AL-41F-1 engine used in the Sukhoi S-70 Okhotnik heavy subsonic uncrewed combat air vehicle. In this case, the two-dimensional nozzle is intended to reduce the infrared and radar signatures, but it’s far simpler, without any vectoring controls. via X The Okhotnik was first flown with an interim engine, with a standard round nozzle, but the revised nozzle was fitted to the second aircraft, which was rolled out in December 2021, as you can read about here. As for the flat nozzle version of the AL-51F-1, its future rests very heavily on that of the proposed Su-57M. Work on this enhanced version of the Felon was already well underway when the Su-57 entered production and service, although, with only 76 examples of the original model under contract, it’s far from certain that it will progress further, at least in the near term. Also known as the T-50M, formal work on the ‘deeply modernized’ Su-57M began when Sukhoi received a contract from the Russian Ministry of Defense in October 2018. At one point there were reports of a T-50M prototype beginning flight tests in mid-2022, and series production by the end of 2024. Obviously, these targets have been missed, but if Russia — or an export client — does order more Felons, then this could help kickstart the Su-57M as well. At that point, we might get to see a production version of the two-dimensional thrust-vectoring version of the AL-51F-1 engine, as well.

Tilting Mark 41 Launcher Emerges During Guam’s First Aegis Ashore...	The U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA) conducted its first live intercept of a ballistic missile from the West Pacific island of Guam on Tuesday. The successful test also highlighted new details about the launchers used with the new Aegis Guam System, initial information about which The War Zone was first to report on. The test launch, dubbed Flight Experiment Mission-02 (FEM-02), is considered a key step toward providing 360-degree protection for the strategic outpost, which is on its way to becoming the most densely protected piece of land on the planet. It saw the Aegis Guam System fire a Standard Missile-3 Block IIA (SM-3 Block IIA) to intercept a mock air-launched medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM ). The target MRBM was successfully hit more than 200 nautical miles to the northeast of the island, according to the MDA and the U.S. military’s Joint Task Force-Micronesia. The U.S. Missile Defense Agency's successful intercept of a ballistic missile off Guam. (U.S. Missile Defense Agency) The Aegis Guam System fired the SM-3 Block IIA from a launcher based on the Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS). A picture released by the agency and Lockheed Martin, seen below, reveals that the launcher can actually tilt at least in one direction and can sit vertical for loading weapons and servicing. This is unlike the fixed launcher towers used in existing Aegis Ashore systems. We have reached out to Lockheed Martin, the defense contractor behind the launcher, for more information about this launch system and what benefits it offers. Tilting the launchers to the west, where threats would primarily emanate from, could potentially add a bit more range to some weapons. And every mile would count when it comes to defending the island from a multi-layered missile attack. (U.S. Missile Defense Agency) Missile Defense Agency (U.S. Missile Defense Agency) The test also marked the first end-to-end engagement utilizing the AN/TPY-6 radar during a live ballistic missile defense test, according to the agency, and is the first demonstration we’ve seen of the growing, layered and integrated air and missile defense web that will blanket the island. AN/TPY-6 is based on the same technology as the AN/TPY-7 Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR), according to manufacturer Lockheed Martin. The LRDR is currently used in Alaska, and was also planned for Hawaii, but funding has since dried up for the Hawaii effort, Inside Defense reported in 2023. Guam, about three times the size of Washington, D.C., hosts U.S. Navy combat vessels and rotational deployments of combat aircraft, along with many other capabilities, including military communications and surveillance systems. It is a central cog in the Pentagon’s strategic deterrence efforts in the Indo-Pacific region. During a crisis, the island’s port and airfields would be flooded with U.S. and allied troops and platforms. Few American missions in the region are arguably more critical than protecting Guam. As such, Beijing would place Guam and its U.S. Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps forces in the crosshairs should a full-scale conflict erupt. China’s growing arsenal of ballistic missiles pose the greatest threat to the strategic island outpost. (U.S. Missile Defense Agency) 'The future is focused on defending Guam and protecting forces from any potential regional missile threats,' the MDA said in a statement. Tuesday’s test was part of an ongoing buildup of the so-called Guam Defense System (GDS), which is also referred to in online military records as the Enhanced Integrated Air and Missile Defense (EIAMD) system. It will lean on as many as 20 new air defense sites bristling with surface-to-air interceptors, radars and other assets to counter an attack if war with China breaks out. The MDA test also showcased the joint, interlocking nature of Guam’s defense, and how that task would likely involve not only the U.S. military services, but regional allies as well. While the surrogate threat missile was tracked from Aegis Ashore, the Navy destroyer USS Milius (DDG-69) also detected, tracked and simulated engaging the ballistic missile, providing another layer of sea-based missile defense, according to Joint Task Force-Micronesia. Meanwhile, a U.S. Army Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) unit based on Guam also tracked the missile, while the Japanese destroyer JS Haguro (DDG-180) 'exercised its air defense support' as well. (U.S. Army) www.twz.com TWZ first reported on the plans for drastically beefing up Guam’s defense in August 2023, as military authorities worked to inform local residents of the effort and how it would impact their lives. The Aegis Ashore system that was used in Tuesday’s test is at the core of the Guam defense plan, but it looks very different from other U.S. Aegis Ashore sites in Romania and Poland, the latter of which was declared mission-ready in July 2024. Romania’s system has been in operation since 2016. While the final configuration of Aegis Ashore on Guam remains to be seen, the MDA has noted that it will be distributed to a far greater extent than its predecessors, and could involve certain components being placed in hardened underground facilities or road-mobile ground platforms, TWZ reported. Guam’s Aegis system differs in other ways as well, according to an October 2024 TWZ report that highlighted initial glimpses of the Mk 41 VLS there: 'Aegis Ashore is primarily designed to engage ballistic threats during the midcourse portion of their flight outside the Earth’s atmosphere using SM-3 interceptors. However, the Mk 41 is a modular launcher, meaning that additional anti-missile interceptors, such as the terminal-stage intercept and anti-air SM-6 and the forthcoming Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI), which could also be added. With its ability to take down certain incoming hypersonic threats, as well as other weapons, the GPI could be especially relevant for the defense of Guam. With additional launchers, even dispersed around the island, shorter-ranged missiles, such as the Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) Block II and even the latest SM-2s, could feasibly provide protection against air breathing threats, such as cruise missiles and drones. Patriot interceptors are now also now a possibility.' A map published by the MDA in October 2024 reveals 16 proposed sites across the island for air defense system assets, including Ritidian Point at Guam’s northern end, Naval Base Guam’s (NBG) Barrigada site in the middle of the island and a location within the Naval Munitions Site (NMS) to the south. (U.S. Missile Defense Agency) Another map shows nine radar arcs, including a comparatively larger arc projecting from Ritidian Point, which is now under the jurisdiction of the Marine Corps’ new Camp Blaz. (U.S. Missile Defense Agency) Other air systems that could engage various types of ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as fixed-wing aircraft and drones, during an attack include Patriot surface-to-air missiles, and lower-tier anti-air missile systems to include medium-range and short range (SHORAD) systems, as well as possibly directed energy weapons in the future. Go here to read more about the lower-tier capabilities that will protect Guam. Precisely when all the planned GDS pieces will be installed and ready to operate remains unclear, but officials have said they want at least some of the components operational by 2026. While much remains to be seen, Tuesday’s takedown of a ballistic missile threat underscored one way that the Pentagon plans to lock down Guam’s airspace in the event of crisis, and how it will need a panoply of systems to accomplish this vital task.

Russia Giving North Korea MiG-29s And Su-27s Isn’t That Straightf...	North Korea is set to receive MiG-29 Fulcrum and Su-27 Flanker fighter aircraft from Russia in return for Pyongyang having sent thousands of troops to fight in Moscow’s war in Ukraine. This is the assessment of the commander of the United States Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM), after much speculation about the nature of the support that might be headed to North Korea to reward that country for its growing military backing of Russia. The prospect of fighter aircraft being transferred by Russia is something that TWZ has discussed in the past but there are questions to be asked about how simple it will be to provide Pyongyang with serviceable MiG-29s and Su-27s — especially at short notice. Adm. Samuel Paparo, the USINDOPACOM commander, recently told reporters that Moscow and Pyongyang had reached an agreement on the fighter transfer. Speaking at the Reagan National Defense Forum in Simi Valley, California, Paparo notes that the aircraft involved were older, fourth-generation types, but were still 'formidable.' U.S. Navy Adm. Samuel Paparo, left, commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, gives two thumbs up after a successful strike during a joint exercise. U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Kurtis A. Hatcher Petty Officer 1st Class Kurtis A Hatcher Paparo also provided some other details about the deployment of North Korean soldiers to assist Russia in its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, as well as the counteroffensive directed against Ukrainian troops in the Kursk region. The admiral said that North Korea had provided the troops without prompting and that, although they have been deployed to combat zones, they haven’t yet seen active combat. This is contrary to other statements, including from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has said that North Korean soldiers are in engaged in combat on the front line. Regardless, providing troops — as well as significant quantities of arms, including huge numbers of artillery shells, and all the way up to short-range ballistic missiles — clearly seems to have paid off for Pyongyang. As we have discussed in the past, a Russian offer to revamp the aging Korean People’s Air Force (KPAF) would almost certainly be snapped up by North Korea. The most capable aircraft in the KPAF inventory are MiG-29 fighters and Su-25 Frogfoot ground-attack aircraft, followed by older MiG-23 Flogger swing-wing combat jets. Otherwise, its combat fleet comprises even more antiquated equipment, including Chinese-made H-5 Beagle first-generation jet bombers, Soviet-era MiG-21 Fishbeds and their Chinese F-7 equivalents, and Chinese-made F-6 Farmers — a first-generation supersonic fighter. Even F-5 Fresco jets —a license-built version of the MiG-17, which was first flown in 1950 — remain in KPAF service, although these are reportedly only now considered for suicide missions. Back in September 2023, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited the Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association (KnAAPO), based in Komsomolsk-on-Amur in the Russian Far East. This plant builds advanced fighters including the Su-57 Felon next-generation fighter and the Su-35 Flanker multirole fighter, the two highest-end single-seat fighters in Russian service today. Kim’s visit to KnAAPO led to speculation that advanced fighters might be headed to North Korea, which at that point was preparing to provide Russia with artillery shells and other materiel. At the time of the visit, Mikhail Degtyarev, regional governor of Khabarovsk Krai, where the KnAAPO facility is located, took to Telegram to provide details and the following statement: 'Our fathers and grandfathers fought together against Japanese militarism, our country supported North Korea in its fight against the United States’ imperialist ambitions in the 1950s, and today we jointly stand up to the pressure of the collective West.' Meanwhile, in our reporting of the visit, TWZ wrote: 'Clearly, the Su-35 and Su-57 jets produced by KnAAPO would represent a huge upgrade over the severely outdated equipment that North Korea’s air arm currently flies … [But] even if top-of-the-line Su-35s and Su-57s are not on the table, other less capable aircraft would still be a massive upgrade for Pyongyang compared to its existing fleet of older Russian-made jets … Almost anything available from Russia would be sought after, whether MiG-29SMTs, Su-27s, or Su-30s. Even a supply of spare parts and overhauls of its current types would be of great value to Pyongyang.' North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visits the KnAAPO aircraft factory, accompanied by Russian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry and Trade, Denis Manturov (third from right), on September 15, 2023. Photo by Gov of Khabarovsk Reg/M. Degtyaryov/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images Based on Paparo’s statements, it seems that only the MiG-29 and Su-27 are currently being lined up for transfer to North Korea, a decision that raises some important questions. After all, the presence in Russian military service of both the MiG-29 and Su-27 is now dwindling and these types are by now long out of production. Aside from a handful used for test duties and with display teams, Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) first-generation MiG-29s are now found only within one training regiment, and a frontline regiment based in Armenia. One less likely, but possible source of MiG-29s could be the aircraft that were refurbished for use by Wagner in support of the Khalifa Haftar’s forces in the Libyan civil war. These unmarked jets appeared at Russia’s Khmeimim Air Base in Syria, where we got a better look at them, before being deployed to Libya. The current status of these jets is very much unclear. An unmarked MiG-29 at Khmeimim Air Base in Syria. via @200_zoka The status of the more modern MiG-29SMT — a type that Russia inherited from a botched Algerian order — is a bit more complex. While these aircraft — which are multirole-capable — went into service at Kursk-Khalino, they have since been stored for a longer period. They would require some degree of overhaul to make them active again, were they to be transferred to North Korea. One of the former Algerian MiG-29SMT fighters seen in Russian service in 2013. Alex Beltyukov/Wikimedia Commons The 28/6 MiG-29SMT/UBs remaining from the failed Algerian deal were taken over by the Russian AF in 2010. The 14th Guards Regiment used them between 2010 and 2019 at Kursk airfield, and replaced them with Su-30SMs, so the original Russian SMTs flew for just under ten years!!! pic.twitter.com/BXKiNikX3o&mdash; Eastern Order of Battle (@EasternOrbat) December 7, 2024 Russia's most advanced MiG-29s, the naval MiG-29KRs that are assigned to the country's only aircraft carrier's air wing, are an option, but also a questionable one. Handing those jets over to North Korea would mean the Admiral Kuznetsov carrier would only have aged Su-33s for its fixed wing contingent. Although the ship has not been to sea for many years and its refurbishment has been plagued with disasters and delays, it doesn't seem like Russia has given up on it, at least yet. MiG-29KR (Russian Navy) If Russia figures keeping a token carrier air wing intact is less important than keeping North Korea happy at such a critical time, the MiG-29KRs could be supplied. This would give North Korea the most capable examples of the type. Still, these jets have had their fair share of issues for Russia and the only other operator, the Indian Navy, having a rocky experience operating the type. As for the Su-27, these are also still in small numbers to test and training units and display teams, but frontline operators are now limited to four bases: Krymsk, Petrozavodsk-Besovets, Belbek in Russian-occupied Crimea, and Tsentralnaya Uglovaya. The associated units are now mainly in the process of being re-equipped with more modern Su-30 series or Su-35 Flankers. A Russian Su-27SM operated by the 4th State Air Personnel Preparation and Military Evaluation Center at Lipetsk. Dmitry Terekhov/Wikimedia Commons Overall, this doesn’t leave a huge inventory of readily available MiG-29 and Su-27 fighters for potential transfer to Pyongyang. Making these aircraft available to North Korea at short notice would leave gaps in the VKS fighter force — and potentially also eat into vital training capacity. Also, these hard-worked fighters are now very old, although that’s likely less of an issue for North Korea, used to working with vintage equipment. MiG-29s would make more sense for North Korea since the KPAF already operates them. On the other hand, there are fewer MiG-29s available in VKS use compared with the bigger and more capable Su-27, on which North Korean pilots and maintainers would require a longer period of conversion training. Two female pilots make an appearance in front of a MiG-21 fighter during North Korea’s first airshow in 2016. AP The other option would be to refurbish MiG-29 and Su-27 aircraft from the considerable numbers of these jets that are in long-term storage around Russia. This would be a long and expensive process, however, especially with Russian aerospace overhaul concerns already heavily engaged in supporting their domestic customers, especially to ensure serviceability among combat fleets for the war in Ukraine. It’s worth noting that, outside of the MiG-29 and Su-27, Russia would appear to have a readymade fleet of fighters for transfer to North Korea. A batch of more advanced Su-35s has already been built for Egypt, but that deal collapsed, apparently under U.S. pressure. A proposal to transfer to Iran some of the Su-35s has so far not materialized, which could leave them available for North Korea. On the other hand, Paparo’s statements, referring only to the MiG-29 and Su-27, would seem to rule that out and we still don’t know for sure if the Iranian deal will fall through. One of the Su-35s built for Egypt but never transferred to that country.@nskplanes Whatever the source of the MiG-29 and Su-27 aircraft apparently now headed to North Korea, they will be a welcome addition to the KPAF. But, as we have discussed before, they may well not be the only Russian defense products headed in the same direction. As well as fighters, North Korea would also almost certainly be interested in other Russian technologies, too, whether related to the modernization of other parts of its armed forces or to assist in furthering its own missile and space programs. There have already been indications that North Korea is due to receive air defense systems from Russia — potentially S-400 long-range surface-to-air missiles — and Pyongyang would very likely also covet specific other capabilities, including ballistic missile technologies, especially reentry vehicles, as well as new submarine technologies. On a broader military level, North Korea and Russia have ratified a mutual defense treaty, which calls for each side to come to the other’s aid in case of an armed attack. In addition, the growing relationship between Russia and North Korea has seen increased economic cooperation and energy shipments. Another intriguing dynamic in this affair involves the relationship between Russia and South Korea. While MiG-29s and Su-27s hardly change the power balance on the Korean peninsula, Seoul will likely be alarmed at the prospect of North Korea receiving any kind of defense aid from Russia. A spectator poses for photos before a North Korean MiG-29 during the second day of the Wonsan Friendship Air Festival in Wonsan on September 25, 2016. Photo by ED JONES/AFP via Getty Images ED JONES In the past, the South Korean Foreign Ministry has warned Russia of 'very negative impacts' on its relations with Seoul if it continues to expand its military cooperation with North Korea. This is especially ironic considering that Russia and South Korea previously had a military relationship of their own, primarily based around Moscow delivering various kinds of arms — including armored vehicles and anti-tank missiles — to Seoul as a way of paying back debts incurred during the Soviet era. For now, there are very many questions still to be answered surrounding the anticipated delivery of MiG-29s and Su-27s to North Korea. Importantly, however, these are older and significantly less capable than the more recent Su-35 and Su-57 that at one time seemed to be potentially on the table for Pyongyang. Moreover, their fairly limited presence in the Russian Armed Forces at this point means that it’s not entirely straightforward to deliver MiG-29s and Su-27s at short notice. Perhaps more importantly, however, is the symbolic value of such a transfer, further cementing the growing military partnership between Russia and North Korea, which is playing out in Ukraine and, which, before long, looks like it will also bring about a modest — but badly needed — modernization of the Korean People’s Air Force.

Israel Lays Waste To Syria’s Missile Boats	Pictures and videos have now emerged of the aftermath of Israeli strikes on the Syrian port of Latakia overnight, which destroyed at least six Soviet-era Osa II class missile boats. The targeting of Syrian Navy assets was part of a larger operation Israel launched involving hundreds of strikes aimed at preventing military assets from the now-defunct regime of Bashar Al Assad from falling into the hands of rebel factions.

Israeli ships reportedly employed unspecified surface-to-surface missiles to hit their targets in Latakia. The Israeli Navy does have a variety of corvettes and missile boats, including types capable of firing Harpoon and Gabriel anti-ship missiles, Naval SPIKE Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS), and loitering munitions. Regardless of the munitions employed, as already noted, available imagery shows at least six Syrian Osa IIs were destroyed in the Israeli operation. Also called the Project 205 missile boat, this is a 1960s-era Soviet design the primary armament of which is the equally dated P-15 Termit anti-ship missile (also known in the West as the SS-N-2 Styx). The P-15 is an active radar-guided missile with the baseline version having a range of 25 miles (40 kilometers) and the improved P-15M variant (which Syria is said to have received) extends that out to 50 miles (80 kilometers). An aerial photo shows Syrian naval ships destroyed during an overnight Israeli attack on the port city of Latakia. AAREF WATAD / AFP via Getty Images AAREF WATAD / AFP via Getty Images AAREF WATAD / AFP via Getty Images Osa IIs, which are 127 feet long and displace 235 tons with a full load, can carry up to four of the large P-15s at a time. The boats, which can hit top speeds of around 40 knots, also have a pair of radar-directed AK-230 close-in weapon systems, each armed with two 30mm automatic cannons, one at the bow and the other at the stern.

AAREF WATAD / AFP via Getty Images Prior to last night's strikes, how many Osa IIs the Syrian Navy still had in inventory, how seaworthy they may have been, and whether any P-15 missiles were still available to load onto them, is unclear. Syria previously acquired a mix of even older Osa I types, as well as Osa IIs, with the latter boats being the most capable surface vessels still in service in Syria to any degree prior to Assad's downfall. The available imagery shows other smaller craft were caught up in the Israeli strikes, which also damaged port infrastructure, as seen below.

Israel's actions have drawn criticism from the United Nations, as well as from several countries in the region and the broader Middle East, including Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey. Otherwise, the situation in Syria remains extremely fluid. Various factions are now looking to consolidate their positions after one rebel coalition's lightning advance south to Damascus precipitated the downfall of Assad's brutal decades-long dictatorship this past weekend. Multiple foreign actors beyond Israel, including Russia, the United States, and Turkey, are also actively involved in the country's current affairs. Whatever happens in the coming days, weeks, and months, Israel has already delivered a significant blow to what was left of the Syrian Navy, as well as other military assets belonging to the Assad regime.

Syria’s Suddenly Permissive Airspace Prompts Flurry Of Foreign Ai...	The United States and Israel are capitalizing on the power vacuum left by the demise of the Assad regime in Syria. Israel has carried out a string of attacks that have taken out much of what's left of Assad's weapons caches, naval assets, air force, and air defense systems so they don't fall into the hands of whoever controls Syria next. Facilities tied to Assad's chemical weapons programs and advanced weapons development were also struck. This is in addition to Israeli armor moving into Syria deeper into the Golan Heights to establish a 'buffer zone.' The U.S. has also seized the opportunity to execute large-scale airstrikes across Syria against ISIS. All of this has occurred as Syrian airspace has suddenly become far more permissive than it had been. These actions come amid uncertainty about how the rebels will form a government and who it will align with given that Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) – which led the final uprising – is a U.S.-designated terror group. And considering how chaotic such transitions of power are, especially with so many competing factions in Syria, it's unknown if a wider civil war could erupt and create another even more nebulous power vacuum. It is clearly this uncertainty that the U.S. and Israel are trying to hedge against. Israel and the U.S. getting their licks in during this window of opportunity is something to see. Israel neutered Assad's legacy higher-end and 'unconventional' capabilities, U.S. went after ISIS. Mad scramble in the power vacuum.

That effort 'is a top-tier priority of ours, and making sure that anything with those types of derivatives, which is everything from chlorine to far worse is destroyed or cared for,' a U.S. official told reporters on Sunday. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, ruled out having U.S. troops on the ground in Syria to assist. 'I would not envision a scenario where we have U.S. boots on the ground for such a mission,' the official said. 'I think we have ways to take care of these things. But it is a primary focus.' The key to securing the chemical weapons is having Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) inspectors’ boots on the ground, David Adesnik of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) told us. 'The U.S. has ample incentives it can use to encourage Damascus to cooperate if its cooperation is for sale,' he said of relations with the government replacing Assad. 'We can adjust the speed at which we lift sanctions on Syria or contribute to reconstruction. Damascus also needs us to help broker a rapprochement with the Kurdish-led SDF, which is sitting on top of most of Syria’s oil and gas.' CENTCOM’s airstrikes came after President-elect Donald Trump stated on social media that America has no business in Syria, where there are still about 900 U.S. troops. Trump's reaction to the fall of Assad likely offered a preview into what could be a more hands-off approach to that country. 'There was never much of a benefit in Syria for Russia, other than to make Obama look really stupid,' Trump said on his Truth Social social media platform. 'In any event, Syria is a mess, but is not our friend, & THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT. LET IT PLAY OUT. DO NOT GET INVOLVED!' You can see that message below. '…THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT. LET IT PLAY OUT. DO NOT GET INVOLVED!' Says Donald Trump on his Truth Social about Syria while the US has its military presence in Syria. pic.twitter.com/vKUH36Q02g&mdash; Qais Alamdar (@Qaisalamdar) December 7, 2024 It should be noted that in 2017 when he was president, Trump ordered a Tomahawk missile strike on Syrian targets in response to Assad using sarin gas in an attack on Khan Shaykhun that killed hundreds. A year later, however, he decided with little warning and against overwhelming advice from his cabinet and senior advisers to rapidly withdraw all personnel from Syria and end combat operations in the country overall. That action spurred Defense Secretary James Mattis to resign. That move never came to pass before Trump lost his re-election bid to Joe Biden, who maintained a U.S. military presence inside Syria. As noted earlier, Israel is also bombing many targets in Syria and has moved more troops into the demilitarized zone separating the Golan Heights it occupies from the rest of Syria. The goal, according to officials in Jerusalem, is to improve Israel’s security situation by creating a buffer zone and dismantling 'strategic weapons systems' before they can fall into the hands of nefarious groups or even a future Syrian government. 'The only interest we have is the security of Israel and its citizens,' Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar told reporters on Monday. 'That’s why we attacked strategic weapons systems, like, for example, remaining chemical weapons, or long-range missiles and rockets, in order that they will not fall in the hands of extremists.' Saar did not provide details about when or where the strikes took place. However, Fox News reported on Twitter that the Israeli Air Forces (IAF) 'hit over 250 targets in Syria last night hours after U.S. bombers and strike aircraft dropped 140 satellite-guided bombs on ISIS&#8230;' IDF hit over 250 targets in Syria last night hours after U.S. bombers and strike aircraft dropped 140 satellite-guided bombs on ISIS.

Tehran’s ability to rearm that group will be severely hampered by not having Syrian or Russian air forces and air defense systems protecting what was already a porous sky from airstrikes on weapons storage facilities and transshipment points. For 35 years, the Assad regime helped Iran maintain a counterbalance to U.S. and Israeli influence in the region and now that's gone. However, Tehran still has the Houthis in Yemen and several militias in Iraq along with a defanged Hezbollah and a besieged Hamas in Gaza. Speaking of the Houthis, some leaders of the Yemen militant group are reportedly openly disparaging Assad now that he is no longer part of the so-called Axis of Resistance. It *is* news however that many senior officials in the upper echelons of the state in Sana'a can talk about it openly now that Assad has been toppled and fled his country in disgrace, and don't have to keep silent out of respect for internal axis cohesion.&mdash; روني الدنماركي (@Aldanmarki) December 9, 2024 After spending decades and billions backing Assad during the civil war, Iran is facing an internal backlash.

Meanwhile, the fate of Khmeimim Air Base and Tartus Naval Base - its two key military facilities located on the Mediterranean Sea - remains in question. You can read more about that in our latest piece here. The U.S. and Israel aren't the only ones bombarding targets in Syria, either. There is an ongoing proxy war between Turkey and Kurds, with both sides using drone strikes amid fierce fighting in the northern and eastern parts of Syria. U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian forces (SDF) hit Turkish-backed Syrian militants with drones.

As we noted in the opening of this piece, the ferocity of these strikes are largely opportunistic in nature. Concerns about equipment and capabilities falling into the hands of current and potentially future enemies is one driver, but the ability to operate over the country freely is a new development. A complex arrangement of loose norms and constantly morphing deconfliction channels existed for some actors to share the airspace to a limited degree, but the western part of the country remained a relatively high-threat area. This is especially true when it comes to Israel's air operations. Often times the IAF would use standoff munitions to keep manned fighters outside of the highest-risk areas, if possible. With Assad's regime gone and the husk of his military in disarray, as well as Russia's degraded air picture and need to protect its immediate interests, now is clearly seen as the time to strike. Israel, in particular, is working to reduce the future risk of a hostile Syrian regime by neutering what was left of Assad's more advanced and deadly military capabilities. Thus the free-for-all of sorts in terms of the application of airpower over the country in the last 48 hours or so. The ongoing airstrikes in Syria come amid uncertainty about what kind of government the HTS-led rebel alliance will form. HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Julani has emphasized a new approach, delivering a message of inclusion. In a speech following the capture of Damascus, Julani said the Syrian people are the 'rightful owners' of the country after Assad's ouster and declared a 'new history' has been written for the entire Middle East, Al Jazeera reported. 'We [the Syrian people] are the rightful owners [of this country]. We have been fighting, and today we have been rewarded with this victory,' he said. However, there are still concerns about what direction Julani might take and if he can even wrangle enough of Syria's warring factions to create a stable government. Saudi Arabia, a Sunni nation that has battled the Shia Houthis in Yemen backed by Iran, is calling for 'unified efforts to safeguard Syria's unity and cohesion. These efforts are essential to protecting Syria from sliding into chaos and division, The Kingdom affirms its support for all measures aimed at achieving Syria's security and stability while preserving its sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity.'

'Qatar plans to speak with Mohamed al-Bashir, an HTS leader, on Tuesday, the day after he was appointed to lead Syria's transitional administration,' Reuters noted. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose forces are striking targets in Syria and pushing deeper into the country at any time since 1973, offered a mixed message on Monday about his nation's approach to a new government in Damascus. 'If we can establish neighborly relations and peaceful relations with the new forces emerging in Syria, that's our desire,' he said. 'But if we do not, we will do whatever it takes to defend the State of Israel and the border of Israel.' A U.S. official on Monday told The War Zone that it was too early to say what approach America will take to Syria's new leaders. However, Washington said it will assess not just their words, but their actions. 'After 14 years of conflict, the Syrian people finally have reason for hope,' U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement on Sunday. 'The Assad regime’s refusal since 2011 to engage in a credible political process and its reliance on the brutal support of Russia and Iran led inevitably to its own collapse. The United States strongly supports a peaceful transition of power to an accountable Syrian government through an inclusive Syrian-led process. During this transitional period, the Syrian people have every right to demand the preservation of state institutions, the resumption of key services, and the protection of vulnerable communities.' 'We have taken note of statements made by rebel leaders in recent days, but as they take on greater responsibility, we will assess not just their words, but their actions,' Blinken added. 'We again call on all actors to respect human rights, take all precautions to protect civilians, and to uphold international humanitarian law.'

Fate Of Russia’s Prized Syria Bases: What We Know	What will happen to highly strategic Russian air and naval bases in Syria is now very much now an open question following the downfall of long-time strongman Bashar Al Assad. Though Russia has pulled back forces, it is unclear whether there are plans to abandon the crucial facilities for good. There are now signs that the Kremlin could be looking to cut a deal with the same rebels it has spent the better part of the last decade fighting. The current situation in Syria is extremely fluid following the final and total collapse this weekend of the brutal decades-old Assad regime. It took the Command of Military Operations rebel coalition, with Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) at its helm, some two weeks to steamroll its way from areas under its control in the northwest to the capital Damascus. Other rebel factors, including U.S.-backed predominantly Kurdish forces in the east, had subsequently launched their own offensives. The full map of Syria now looks like this &mdash; MAKS 24 (@maks23.bsky.social) 2024-12-08T14:55:37.281Z Rebel forces are now in at least de facto control of Syria's Latakia and Tartus regions, which are home to Russia's Khmeimim Air Base and Tartus naval base, respectively.

The ships in port are a huge and relatively defenseless targets just sitting there.

Maintaining access to Khmeimim and Tartus, if feasible, would be a top priority for the Kremlin. As The War Zone has previously explored in detail, the bases are of great importance to Russia well beyond its operations in Syria. The Russian government has also spent considerable resources to expand their abilities to serve as strategic regional hubs for air and naval operations, as well as key logistics nodes, especially for activities across Africa. Tartus also notably provides the Russian Navy with its only current warm-water port facility with direct access to the Mediterranean. The airfield offers a similarly unique point of power projection for the Kremlin. 2/ Russia has leveraged its Tartus naval base to project power in the Mediterranean Sea, threaten NATO's southern flank, and link its Black Sea assets to the Mediterranean Sea. pic.twitter.com/BXsxwQPHTg&mdash; Institute for the Study of War (@TheStudyofWar) December 9, 2024 4/ Russia could seek to leverage its presence in Libya or Sudan as alternatives, but the lack of formal agreements with these countries and insufficient infrastructure makes them inadequate substitutes. pic.twitter.com/YkaMwM4Hhb&mdash; Institute for the Study of War (@TheStudyofWar) December 9, 2024 The Russians are starting to get very nervous… They write that the loss of Syria as a refueling and logistics point undermines all of Russia's efforts on the African continent. pic.twitter.com/s4h5hWVgBk&mdash; MAKS 24 (@Maks_NAFO_FELLA) December 9, 2024 Russia's immediate bargaining position is complicated by the fact that it intervened militarily in 2015 on Assad's behalf and very actively fought for years to keep that regime in power. Russian operations in Syria were characterized by at best indiscriminate attacks on areas full of civilians and at worst deliberate targeting of civilian infrastructure, especially hospitals. The Kremlin also worked to shield Assad's regime from broader international repercussions, including over its use of chemical weapons. Russian combat aircraft were flying sorties against anti-regime forces as recently as last week. There were also reports of ships in port at Tartus and/or forces ashore there firing missiles at rebels at they advanced. The Kremlin has made a further statement in this regard by giving Assad asylum in Russia, at least for now. Proof of this remains elusive. Regardless, doing so does give the Kremlin an additional bargaining chip as many groups are likely to be looking for accountability of various kinds from the former Syrian dictator.

He’s useless now, if there was a payment it already was received. Just a thought experiment.&mdash; Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) December 9, 2024 On top of all that, Russia officially designated HTS, which now says it is looking to form a transitional Syrian government, as a terrorist group in 2020. HTS evolved from the Al Nusra Front, which at one point was Al Qaeda's main franchise in Syria, but claimed to have broken away from the international terrorist organization in 2016. The United States and the United Kingdom, among others, have also officially designated HTS as a terrorist group. The U.S. has a $10 million bounty out on Jolani himself. HTS is also just one of a number of rebel factions that control substantial territory across Syria and which Russia has listed as terrorists over the years. This includes the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces in the east, which American authorities say they will continue to support ostensibly to guard against ISIS taking advantage of the current situation. Over the weekend, U.S. B-52 bombers, F-15 Strike Eagle combat jets, and A-10 Warthog ground attack aircraft struck dozens of ISIS-linked targets, underscoring that ongoing mission. However, over the weekend, President-elect Donald Trump also declared 'THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT' in a post about Syria on social media and has pushed for withdrawing U.S. forces from there entirely in the past.

Moscow has long had an on-again-off-again relationship with Ankara, particularly with regard to the Syrian civil war. The HTS-led advance from the north notably marked the final collapse of a ceasefire deal Russian and Turkish authorities had brokered in 2020. CNN Turk reported yesterday, without appearing to cite any sources, that Russia had requested Turkish help in withdrawing forces from the country, but also that the Kremlin would retain its Khmeimim and Tartus bases. At the same time, there are signs that the Kremlin is already looking, if possible, to engage with whatever regime now emerges in Syria. 'It's premature to talk about it yet,' Dmitry Peskov, spokesperson for Russian President Vladimir Putin, told reporters earlier today, according to Reuters. 'This is all a subject for discussion with those who will be in power in Syria.' 'Of course, everything is being done now that is necessary and everything that is possible in order to get in touch with those who can deal with security,' he added. 'And, of course, our military is also taking all necessary precautions.' 'We are in dialogue with Ankara and other regional states, including on Syrian affairs,' Peskov further noted. 'Indeed, Syria is going to have a very difficult period now, due to instability. And, of course, it is very important to maintain a dialogue with all regional countries here. We are determined to do this.'

'This new triumph, my brothers, marks a new chapter in the history of the region, a history fraught with dangers [that left] Syria as a playground for Iranian ambitions, spreading sectarianism, stirring corruption,' HTS leader Ahmed Hussein Al Shar'a, better known by his nom de guerre Abu Mohammad Al Jolani (or simply as Jolani), said in a victory speech yesterday, according to CNN. Jolani did not mention any other country by name. Iran had also been a major supporter of Assad both directly and through the Iranian-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. For groups like HTS, despite past history, Russia, along with China (which has called for a 'political solution' to Syria's future), may offer the possibility of more pragmatic and pliable partners, at least in the near term. The United States and the United Kingdom notably say they have no current plans to de-list HTS as a terrorist group. What happens now to Russia's prized bases in Syria, and its broader influence in the country, is uncertain, but there are signs that the Kremlin is not yet completely over.

UK’s 757-Based ‘Excalibur’ Avionics Testbed For Tempest Future Fi...	The United Kingdom has taken an important step toward its Tempest next-generation fighter, with the start of a trials campaign for the Flight Test Aircraft (FTA), nicknamed Excalibur, which will serve as a flying laboratory for the new combat aircraft. Based on a Boeing 757 airliner, the FTA joins a growing band of dedicated trials aircraft that are being used to prove out technologies for current and future-generation fighter programs, also in the United States and China. In a joint statement today, the two prime contractors responsible for the FTA — Leonardo and 2Excel — and the U.K. Ministry of Defense announced that the aircraft has successfully completed its first phase of modification and flight testing. The aircraft has been fitted with new side and belly pods, which were assessed for stability during flight. The latest Tempest configuration. BAE Systems These fairings are designed to host the Integrated Sensors, Non-Kinetic Effects (ISANKE), and Integrated Communications Systems (ICS) that Leonardo is developing as part of its work on the Global Combat Air Program (GCAP) — the overarching effort that has the Tempest crewed fighter at its core. While GCAP involves the United Kingdom, Italy, and Japan, the Tempest also falls within the remit of the U.K.’s Future Combat Air System (FCAS) program. This is a wide-ranging effort that also includes advanced uncrewed platforms, next-generation air-launched weapons, networks and data sharing, and more. An earlier BAE Systems graphic from the Tempest program shows some of the key ancillary systems and technologies that are being developed alongside the crewed fighter. BAE Systems That the FTA was now in the air had been confirmed by several recent sightings of the aircraft operating out of QinetiQ’s Boscombe Down facility in Wiltshire, southern England. The FTA performs a test flight over southern England last week. Ian Turner At this point, the FTA has the fairings for the various ISANKE and ICS components, but the actual technology demonstrator systems are yet to be installed. It’s unclear exactly when these will be added, with today’s announcement only stating that it will start to fly with them 'within the next years.' Once installed, onboard scientists and engineers will then test and refine the systems during flight trials, de-risking critical technologies for the Tempest and GCAP/FCAS and accelerating the development program — if all goes to plan. Concept artwork of the 757-based Excalibur flying testbed. 2Excel Before that, Excalibur will undergo further engineering work at Boscombe Down, which will include adding a fighter-style nose cone, to host the Tempest’s advanced new radar. This radar is being developed by Leonardo under the Multi-Function Radio Frequency System program. Artist’s renderings of the final FTA configuration also show additional fairings under the nose — perhaps for an electro-optical sensor — and on the side of the nose. Two further fairings are also shown below the rear fuselage. A computer-generated artwork shows the final planned Flight Test Aircraft (FTA) configuration. 2Excel A close-up of the forward fuselage fairings on the Flight Test Aircraft (FTA). 2Excel In the past, 2Excel has stated that Excalibur is planned to have a maximum payload capacity of 16 tons and will operate at an altitude of 42,000 feet at speeds as high as Mach 0.86. The aircraft has a maximum range of 3,900 nautical miles and an endurance of eight hours. While there’s a long tradition of using surrogate aircraft as avionics testbeds, it’s interesting that the narrowbody 757 is forging something of a niche in this field. Honeywell’s 757 testbed with an HTF7000 turbofan engine installed on the aircraft’s third pylon for a test-flight program. Honeywell In the United States, Honeywell has long used a 757 for test duties, while Boeing’s 757 Flying Test Bed — better known as ‘The Catfish’ due to its unique and highly modified nose profile — is used in support of the F-22’s sensor and electronic warfare suite. It features a Raptor nose grafted onto the forward fuselage, containing the AN/APG-77 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar. A swept-wing section atop the flight deck houses conformal antennas for the Raptor’s AN/ALR-94 electronic support measures suite. A close-up of the Boeing Catfish. @Task_Force23 The Catfish also seems to have influenced at least one similar platform operated by China. Here, a specially adapted Russian-made Tupolev Tu-204C — itself essentially a clone of the 757 — is used for avionics testing for the J-20 stealth fighter. According to the prime contractors, the British FTA program 'remains on schedule and is proceeding at pace.' Previously Leonardo has said that Excalibur will begin its Tempest flight tests between 'mid-2026 and mid-2028.' A high tempo is certainly a prerequisite of the program since plans call for a supersonic crewed fighter demonstrator aircraft for the Tempest program to be in the air by 2027. Then, the finished Tempest fighter is expected to be in service by 2035. As we reported earlier this year, the building of the demonstrator for the Tempest, so far only known as the Flying Technology Demonstrator, is now underway at the BAE Systems facility in Warton, northern England. As of this summer, over 50 percent of the aircraft, by structural weight, was already being built or had been completed. The demonstrator takes shape on the production line at Warton. Team Tempest As well as the demonstrator’s crew escape system — tests of which have apparently been completed — there has been parallel work on the powerplant. Aerodynamic engine testing has taken place at the Rolls-Royce facility in Filton, England. With the Flying Technology Demonstrator primarily concerned with proving the configuration and dynamics of the Tempest design, it will be down to Excalibur to test the major subsystems. At the same time, there will be a heavy reliance on simulation, including using a digital representation of the Flying Technology Demonstrator that has already been ‘flown’ extensively. In the meantime, the future of the Tempest has begun to be questioned in some quarters. In particular, as the U.K. Ministry of Defense is grappling with budget cuts, which have seen it prematurely retire a range of current assets. This has led to some concern that defense spending priorities may affect future air power efforts, with one possible outcome being a reduction in the priority assigned to the Tempest program. The 757-based Excalibur flying testbed during a test flight prior to its conversion. 2Excel Ultimately, the Tempest could find itself competing for funds with various other big-ticket defense programs, including new nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines. There is also the fact that the United Kingdom is currently still planning on procuring more F-35B stealth fighters, although the exact fleet size for the U.K. Lightning Force has yet to be finalized. Alongside this, there are all the regular challenges involved in developing a new fighter from scratch, especially one incorporating stealth technologies. In programs like these, long development times and high costs are the order of the day. With that in mind, the work of the Excalibur Flight Test Aircraft will be even more important, to ensure that the Tempest program meets its highly optimistic targets.

Australian Navy Fires Tomahawk Cruise Missile For The First Time	Australia has become just the third country to launch a Tomahawk land-attack cruise missile (TLAM) after the Royal Australian Navy’s (RAN) Hobart class destroyer HMAS Brisbane (DDG-41) successfully test fired the long-range weapon for the first time during its current deployment off San Diego, the RAN announced Monday. Australia now joins the United States and the United Kingdom in having the capability. The test fire comes as Brisbane is in the midst of a so-called 'interchangeability deployment' off the American West Coast, and the X account WarshipCam spotted the destroyer pulling in and out of Naval Base San Diego over the past week. Brisbane spending time in SoCal reflects the ever-deepening military ties between Washington and Canberra. The TLAM’s 1,000-mile range instantly beefs up the RAN’s firepower over great maritime distances, a welcomed capability should war with China break out. They can strike ships or shore targets, and they would be a very well-proven standoff weapon in a fight where Beijing seeks to keep the United States and its allies at a distance via anti-access defenses. Tomahawks can also loiter over a target or be tasked to hit another target mid-flight via a satellite data link. Australia isn't the only nation in China's vicinity to pursue Tomahawk missiles. Japan inked a $2.35 billion deal with the United States to acquire 400 of the missiles and support equipment in January 2024, USNI News reported then. 'The successful test firing of the Tomahawk missile demonstrates the strength of our alliance and defence cooperation with the United States, in support of a peaceful, stable and prosperous region,' Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Richard Marles said in a statement. 'By enhancing our own Defence capabilities, and by working with partners, we change the calculus for any potential aggressor so that no state will ever conclude the benefits of conflict outweigh the risks. HMAS Brisbane fires its first TLAM. (Royal Australian Navy) (Royal Australian Navy) The three-ship Hobart class–which in addition to Brisbane includes the class namesake, HMAS Hobart (DDG-40), as well as the destroyer HMAS Sydney (DDG-42), is a sound home for the Tomahawk. The 7,700-tons displacement warships were all commissioned between 2017 and 2020 and are considered Australia’s most modern and capable surface combatants, even as the force moves on plans that would grow the fleet via smaller frigates and optionally crewed warships loaded with missiles. Go here to read TWZ’s past coverage of that vision. Australia is looking to buy more than 200 Tomahawks, both for their Hobart class destroyers and for future platforms, the defense ministry said. The U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency announced last year that the ally had requested to buy up to 200 Tomahawk Block V All Up Rounds, and 20 Tomahawk Block IV All Up Rounds, as well as the associated equipment required to field them, for $895 million. Aside from Tomahawks, it’s been a time of change and new capabilities for the Hobart class in recent years. The Sydney successfully fired an anti-ship Naval Strike Missile (NSM) in August 2024 during the multinational Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise, Richard Thomas at Naval Technology reported. The NSM, with its stealthy design and secondary land-attack capability has been gaining in popularity with fleets around the globe, including America’s, and replaces the Harpoon anti-ship missile aboard those Australian warships. It is slated to be installed on the destroyers and the Anzac-class frigates under a deal inked in 2023, USNI News reported.

(Royal Australian Navy) LSIS Daniel Goodman Hobart successfully fired a SM-2 Standard Missile for the first time in 2019, according to the Australian government. In August 2024, Sydney fired Australia’s first SM-6 missile as well. That missile will be 'progressively deployed' aboard the class and on future Hunter class frigates, according to the government. The SM-6 is the only missile capable of taking on anti-air, anti-surface, strike and elements of ballistic missile defense, according to past TWZ reporting and its manufacturer, Raytheon. It was also reportedly used by a U.S. Navy destroyer to take out a Houthi anti-ship ballistic missile (ASBM). And as cutting-edge munitions come online for the Hobart class, the three ships have already been readied by Lockheed Martin to receive enhanced combat systems. The company announced in November 2023 that it had upgraded the class’ design architecture to support Aegis Combat System Baseline 9 capabilities. Baseline 9 will allow the Hobart class to defend against ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and enemy aircraft simultaneously, TWZ previously reported. USNI News reported in May 2024 that the Baseline 9 upgrade work will begin in 2026. Public records show the Hobart class currently sporting Aegis baseline 7.1. A Tomahawk missile fired from Australia's HMAS Brisbane (DDG041) heads for its target. (Royal Australian Navy) U.S. Navy The destroyers also feature 48 Mark 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) cells, which, along with SM-2 and SM-6 missiles, also pack medium-range surface-to-air RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow missiles (ESSMs). The ships are also fitted with a Mark 45 5-inch main gun, MU90 torpedoes, two 25mm M242 Bushmaster chain guns and a Phalanx Close-In Weapons System (CIWS). While it remains unclear when the Hobart class will have all its newer Aegis and weapons systems in place, Brisbane’s deployment turned historic when it fired the Tomahawk. Australian Defence reported that the ship will be home after Christmas following a five-month, so-called 'interchangeability deployment.' A Tomahawk missile fired from Australia's HMAS Brisbane, moments before impacting it's target. (Royal Australian Navy) U.S. Navy Australia’s 2021 announcement that it would buy Tomahawks from the U.S. for its Hobart class came a day after the U.S., U.K. and Australia announced plans to provide the RAN with nuclear-powered attack submarines under a trilateral agreement known as AUKUS. TWZ has previously reported what AUKUS will mean for Australia’s undersea capabilities, which will involve nuclear-powered boats armed with conventional weapons: 'The U.S. plans to sell Australia between three to five Virginia class submarines that carry Tomahawks loaded in vertical launch tubes systems (VLS). However, the first of those boats won’t be delivered until the early 2030s, pending Congressional approval. The new class of SSN AUKUS will also have VLS tubes capable of launching Tomahawks, but they are not currently scheduled for delivery to RAN until the early 2040s.' While the Australian subs are still years away, AUKUS has already produced increased ties, including American boats stopping for maintenance Down Under. The Virginia class sub USS Hawaii (SSN 776) was the first U.S. boat to do so in August 2024. In addition to turning western Australia’s HMS Stirling naval base into a nuclear sub hub, rotational deployments are also being planned there for American and British boats. The Virginia class attack submarine USS Hawaii (SSN-776) departs Australia's HMAS Stirling base after undergoing maintenance. (U.S. Navy) Lt.Cmdr. Rick Moore To prepare for their own nuclear fleet, the first cohort of Australian officers has gone through the U.S. Navy’s nuclear education pipeline, and the first seven enlisted Australian sailors graduated from the U.S. Navy’s Nuclear Power School in October 2024. Meanwhile, Australian entry into club Tomahawk appears to be restricted solely to the Hobart class destroyers for now. Canberra announced in June 2024 that its six Collins class diesel-electric attack submarines won’t be getting the TLAM capability, which will leave the RAN’s undersea force with a firepower gap for years to come, TWZ previously reported. You can read more about that decision here. Brisbane’s Tomahawk firing once again showcases how Beijing’s rapidly advancing military capabilities have pushed traditional Western allies even closer together. Judging by the comments of some AUKUS nation leaders around the globe, that potential is not far over the horizon. 'We are doing everything humanly and legally possible to optimise the Royal Australian Navy’s surface combatant fleet as quickly as possible, as directed by the Australian Government,' Australian Defence quoted Australian Navy Chief Hammond as saying Monday.

Ukraine’s Drone Boats Are Now Shooting Machine Guns At Russian He...	Ukrainian forces say they are now using Sea Baby drone boats armed with heavy machine guns. The Security Service of Ukraine says the machine gun-toting uncrewed watercraft engaged Russian Flanker-series fighters, Mi-8/Mi-17 Hip helicopters, and Raptor patrol boats during a recent attack on targets on the occupied Crimean Peninsula around the Kerch Bridge. The Security Service of Ukraine (SSU, also known by its Ukrainian abbreviation SBU) released a video earlier today, seen below, that it said showed views through the targeting systems on the machine gun-equipped Sea Baby uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) during the attack on the Kerch Bay area on the night of December 5-6. Kamikaze drones were also reportedly involved in the attack, the results of which are not immediately clear. The SSU/SBU has been using Sea Baby USVs for more than a year now and the family has grown to include baseline kamikaze types and other versions with mounted rocket launchers. 'Intercepted Russian radio communication indicates that there are killed and wounded on board the helicopters. The helicopters themselves were significantly damaged and now require major repairs,' according to a machine translation of the caption accompanying the SSU/SBU video on YouTube. 'Also, SBU drones hit a barge carrying military equipment and equipment for the repair of the Crimean Bridge, which the occupiers are still unsuccessfully trying to restore after previous bombings by the Ukrainian special services.' The War Zone has not been able to immediately verify these claims independently. The video does show Mi-8/Mi-17-series helicopters (as seen at the top of this story) and patrol boats being fired on. A Flanker-type fighter is also seen at one point appearing to conduct a strafing run, but the footage does not clearly show the jet being engaged in return. The exact model of Flanker is unclear, but it appears most likely to be an Su-30SM variant from what can be seen, including its forward canards. Russian Su-30SMs regularly operate over and around the Black Sea including in sorties against Ukrainian maritime forces. Screen captures from SSU/SBU video showing, at left, a Flanker-series fighter conducting what looks to be a strafing run (muzzle flash appears to be visible) and, at right, a better look at the jet as it pulls away. SSU/SBU captures A grainy screen capture from the SSU/SBU video said to show another boat in the sights of a gun-armed Sea Baby. SSU/SBU capture When it comes to the actual weapon systems on the Sea Babies, they are 'equipped with large-caliber machine guns' of unspecified types and 'with ballistic programs for automatic guidance and auto-capture of targets,' according to the SSU/SBU video caption. 'These water drones were manufactured as a result of joint fundraising with UNITED24, monobank, Oleg Gorokhovsky, Sergey Sternenko, and Igor Lachen in February of this year.' The video shows views through electro-optical and infrared cameras, along with a targeting reticle and general user interface in line with that seen on remote weapon stations designed for use on ground vehicles and ships. No external views showing the weapon system installed on the drone boats, which could offer more insight into its capabilities, have emerged so far. Whether the gun-armed Sea Babies are also equipped to act as kamikaze drone boats or are intended to be recovered and reused is unknown. As already noted, this is not the first time that Sea Babies have emerged with additional external armament in addition to their internal explosive payloads. The SSU/SBU has employed versions armed with infantry-type shoulder-fired rocket launchers (reportedly RPV-16s loaded with rockets with thermobaric warheads) and 122mm Grad artillery rockets in the past.

Tonight. pic.twitter.com/jBs61hXQhb&mdash; Special Kherson Cat (@bayraktar_1love) February 1, 2024 At the same time, Russia's forces have been steadily developing and employing new tactics, techniques, and procedures for countering these drone boats from the air and the sea, as is clear from the SSU/SBU's newly released video. The Russian military has also been implementing a still-growing array of defense measures against drone attacks from the sea and the air, as well as other threats, around the Kerch Bridge and other high-value targets in Crimea and elsewhere in the region. Reports of major Ukrainian USV attacks have notably slowed in recent months. As noted earlier, it remains unclear what damage the Ukrainian attack last week caused to Russian targets in the Kerch area. The emergence of the R-73-armed Magura Vs earlier this year already reflected increased aerial threats to Ukraine's USV operations. As The War Zone has highlighted in the past, the rocket-armed Sea Babies would also provide an additional way to still be able to prosecute attacks, at least on some level, in the face of expanding Russian defenses. Still, there are questions about the effectiveness of the new gun-toting Sea Babies and the general utility of employing the USVs armed in this way. The drone boats are already understood to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars apiece before the addition of the new weapon systems, which would be lost by design if they are still intended to end their missions in a kamikaze attack. Ukrainian decision-making regarding the allocation of its resources now comes amid renewed concerns about the future flow of military aid from the West, especially the United States. If nothing else, the new Sea Baby developments highlight the continued speed of iteration when it comes to uncrewed systems across domains being employed by both sides of ongoing the conflict in Ukraine. Whether gun armament ultimately proves worthwhile, Ukrainian forces are clearly continuing to explore ways to challenge Russian countermeasures to their USV operations.

V-22s Grounded Again After Special Operations Osprey Mishap	A mishap on an Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) CV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft last month has led to an operational pause for the U.S. military’s fleet of the aircraft, which are operated by the Marines and Navy as well. The Marines are pausing all non-essential flights. The Osprey was conducting a training mission at Cannon Air Force Base on Nov. 20 when it experienced 'a material failure' that forced the crew of four to make an emergency landing, AFSOC spokesperson Lt. Col. Becky Heyse told The War Zone Monday morning. There were no known injuries or external damage to the aircraft, she added. A CV-22 like this one from Cannon Air Force Base in New Mexico was forced to land on Nov. 20 after experiencing a material failure. (USAF) As they were flying, the crew started to 'get indications in the cockpit to land as soon as possible,' Heyse explained. 'The incident is under investigation, but the initial indications are that this was another material failure. We believe it was different than what occurred last year.' Heyse was referring to the November 29, 2023 mishap that killed all eight aboard a CV-22 operating off the coast of Japan. A subsequent investigation found that the crash was caused by 'a catastrophic failure of one of the tiltrotor’s gearboxes' and 'decisions made by the pilot.' From our story about the investigation: 'After an analysis of the parts of the left-hand [proprootor] PRGB that could be recovered, it was determined that the catastrophic failure in this instance was 'most likely initiated by a crack in one of the high-speed pinion gears and fatigue cracking of the associated pinion gear’s bearing cage. Additionally, at least one piece of the failed high-speed planet pinion wedged in the high-speed carrier assembly, grinding against the high-speed sun gear’s teeth until finally removed.'' In that flight, the pilot and crew did not 'plan for, deliberate, or even discuss' closer suitable landing options after they received the chip burn warning about the left-hand [proprotor gearbox] PRGB, according to the Accident Investigation Board report. The AIB described as an 'insufficient sense of urgency throughout the entire mishap sequence, beginning with the first PRGB cockpit advisory approximately 49 minutes prior to aircraft impact.' Heyse said it was too early to offer any details about the new material failure. Wreckage of the CV-22B Osprey off Yakushima Island, as photographed by the Japan Coast Guard, November 29, 2023. Japan Coast Guard The entire fleet of U.S. Ospreys was finally cleared to fly again in March, which you can read more about here. Now they are grounded again. 'Out of an abundance of caution, NAVAIR recommended an operational pause for all V-22 Osprey variants Dec. 6, 2024,' said spokesman Neil Lobeda. 'This decision comes following a recent precautionary landing of a CV-22. There were no injuries to the crew. The safety of our V-22 aircrew is our top priority. We are committed to ensuring our Sailors, Airmen and Marines are able to successfully complete their missions and return home safely.' All three services have paused their V-22 operations. 'We have a pause right now to our flight training operations, based on the recommendation from NAVIAR,' Heyse told us. 'In response to a NAVAIR recommendation on the V-22 Osprey fleet, the Marine Corps has decided to implement a 96-hour operational pause for non-essential flight operations starting on December 6, 2024,' a USMC spokesman said in a statement. 'This decision underscores our unwavering commitment to the safety of our personnel and the reliability of our aviation platforms. This pause will give us time to determine if any additional measures are necessary to ensure the continued safety and effectiveness of this critical capability. The Marine Corps remains confident in the safety and effectiveness of the MV-22.' Since the Osprey first flew in 1989, more than 400 V-22s have been delivered to the Marines, Air Force, and Navy, as well as the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF), the latter being the only non-U.S. operator of the type. The Marines are by far the largest operator of the Osprey, with some 348 MV-22Bs spread across 17 squadrons. AFSOC has about 50 and the Navy has 36, including one test aircraft. 210825-N-LN075-2010The Marines have paused flying their MV-22 tilt-rotor aircraft. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Jessica Kibena) 'On Dec. 9, 2024, Commander, Naval Air Forces directed an operational pause for all U.S. Navy CMV-22B Ospreys following the recommendation by Naval Air Systems Command,' Navy Cmdr Beth Teach said in a statement. Navy CMV-22Bs.( U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Emma Burgess) The lessons learned from the fatal 2023 crash contributed to the Cannon crew’s ability to land safely, Heyse told us. AFSOC 'updated all procedures after the crash last year,' she said. 'The return to fly part was an increased focus on training and simulators. The initial indicators show that is why they were able to safely land, based on those flight control measures and training taken. We will learn more as the investigation continues. After the November 2023 mishap, all V-22s were limited to flying within 30 minutes of a suitable divert airfield. In particular, this limits the CMV-22's ability to operate from aircraft carriers. The main function of CMV-22B Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft is to perform aircraft carrier onboard delivery (COD). Marine Ospreys from HMX-1 also support presidential airlift mission, primarily carrying the press pool, aids, and Secret Service counter-assault team around, which you can read more about here. This is the latest mishap in a long string of problems for the Ospreys. Overall, the Bell-Boeing tiltrotor has had a checkered history, punctuated by numerous fatal crashes since its first flight in 1989, though U.S. military officials regularly point to a broadly improving track record in the past few decades. For now, we will have to wait and see how long this latest pause lasts, which material part failed, and whether other variants are experiencing the same problem.
