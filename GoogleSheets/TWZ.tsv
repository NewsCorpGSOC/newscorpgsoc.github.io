Navy Making Final Selection For F/A-XX Stealth Fighter, Plans For...	The U.S. Navy expects its sixth-generation fighter to enter service in the 2030s, bringing with it the ability to operate alongside drones and fly missions at long ranges — capabilities seen as essential for future conflict with China. The Navy’s ambitions, if realized, mean that the service may introduce its next-generation crewed fighter before the U.S. Air Force, which is now re-examining requirements for its new stealth combat jet, with the program on temporary hold. As it sits now, the Navy is late in the source selection process on who will build its next generation fighter and that decision could come soon. Like the Air Force, the Navy is working on its sixth-generation fighter as part of a program named Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD). The Navy crewed fighter is often referred to as the F/A-XX. The Navy is involved in direct cooperation with the Air Force’s program and both initiatives put crewed fighters at the center of a broader ‘system of systems’ that will also include advanced Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones. A Boeing concept artwork for the F/A-XX next-generation carrier fighter. Boeing But increasingly the programs seem that they might be headed in differing directions, certainly as far as current timelines are concerned. The Navy’s sixth-generation fighter will have 'advanced sensors, advanced lethality, advanced range, and being able to integrate with manned and unmanned capabilities together,' according to Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti, quoted in an article by Air & Space Forces Magazine. This matches what we previously knew about the initiative. Based on what we know about the two services sharing some technology and even control capabilities for CCA drones, it’s not a surprise that Franchetti mentions the manned/unmanned integration. 'That’s one of the things, as we learn from the Air Force and the work they’re doing, to integrate that with what we know that we need to be able to do,' she added. Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti.

Faced with the prospect of a potential future war in the Pacific with China and facing ever more advanced and further-reaching air defenses, as well as the vast distances involved in such a theater, long range was always seen as being one of the core capabilities of the Air Force’s NGAD fighter. That requirement is likely now being reassessed, although the Navy remains committed to it, according to Franchetti. Allowing for the carrier air wing to be able to reach relevant target sets and a a significant frequency while keeping the carrier itself at a safe distance from anti-ship and other anti-access capabilities is a glaring issue for the USN. Dramatically increasing the unrefueled combat radius of at least some of its fighters, which would be paired with CCAs with similar endurance, would go a long way to solving this problem. The Chief of Naval Operations added that the service plans to place a contract in time for the new fighter to enter service in the 2030s. This is the same kind of timeline that was anticipated for the Air Force’s equivalent new stealth fighter, but the current situation could push that date further to the right. Exactly how the Air Force’s NGAD fighter might be rescoped is unclear at this point and elements of the design have always been a tightly guarded secret anyway. As it stands, however, the Air Force’s NGAD program is under deep review, and it’s possible that there will be significant revisions to better reflect what the service wants — or can afford — out of its next fighter. Above all, this situation has been driven by the realization that the highly advanced aircraft might cost three times as much as a new F-35 — upwards of $300 million per copy. The Air Force is now eying pursuing a far less expensive aircraft, coming in at roughly the same price as an F-35 or F-15EX does, at around $90 million to $100 million each. You can read our deep dive into what this revised NGAD could look like here. An F-35C stealth fighter carrying AGM-158C Long-Range Anti-Ship Missiles (LRASM). U.S. Navy/Dane Wiedmann U.S. Navy/Dane Wiedmann The Navy’s F/A-XX has also not been free of financial woes. As we reported back in the summer, the program’s budget, which was already set to be truncated, could be cut even more severely in the next fiscal year. Members of the Senate are proposing to give the service nearly 90 percent less funding than it asked for to support continued work on the new carrier-based fighter. 'Black budgets' also play a role in a program like this too. Franchetti didn’t appear to mention those fiscal concerns, but the fact that she still said the service expects the aircraft to enter service in the 2030s makes it clear that the program remains a top priority. Still, it's questionable just how achievable that goal is and '2030s' is a broad window to begin with. Whether realistic or not, the Navy will first have to choose between Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman, which are currently in competition to provide the F/A-XX. Franchetti said that the service is now in the process of selecting which design to pursue. Meanwhile, it is understood that just Boeing and Lockheed Martin are perusing the USAF's manned NGAD fighter tender, with Northrop Grumman dropping out of the competition in part to focus on the Navy's program. It was always considered likely that the F/A-XX would share a powerplant with the NGAD, with technology for this being developed under the Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion (NGAP) program. With that in mind, it’s possible that the Air Force reducing the goals of the NGAP program — in line with reductions in performance targets — could have a knock-on effect on the capabilities of the Navy’s NGAD fighter. Whether the Navy would be willing to take a performance hit on its fighter if it meant saving a lot of money, both in development costs and eventual production expenditures, is unclear. General Electric's XA100 adaptive cycle jet engine during testing in 2020. General Electric GE's XA100 engine on a test stand. GE Aviation Aside from the cost factor now impacting decisions on the future of the Air Force NGAD program, there are increasing signs that the service is also reconsidering whether the crewed fighter concept, as understood up to now, is actually the best to meet emerging threats. As far as we know, however, the Navy still expects its F/A-XX and its accompanying drones to replace its F/A-18E/F Super Hornet multirole fighters as well as its EA-18G Growler electronic attack jet, all part of reshaping a carrier air wing that could eventually feature as much as two-thirds uncrewed aircraft. Intriguingly, however, Franchetti said that, while it’s important that the Navy and Air Force NGAD programs are aligned to some degree, this wasn’t the most critical factor in the Navy’s F/A-XX efforts. Making an effort to distance F/A-XX from the current uncertainties around the Air Force’s NGAD is perhaps understandable, considering the pause on the latter program. The Navy should have a much better idea of how the Air Force’s potential overhaul of its NGAD affects its program of the same name once the flying branch makes a decision on the path it wants to take for its sixth-generation fighter initiative. Such a decision is due to be made in the next few months. An artist’s illustration depicts a sixth-generation air dominance fighter of the kind being developed under NGAD. Boeing The Air Force has reiterated that it is committed to having a crewed stealth fighter at the heart of the wider NGAD initiative and that it will have a human pilot to start with, although an optionally crewed version might ultimately be developed too. 'I’m absolutely confident we’re still going to do a sixth-generation crewed aircraft,' Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall said in July of this year. Even if the Air Force NGAD effort ends up taking a radically different approach to meeting the service’s future air combat requirements, that also doesn’t mean that the Navy will not be able to benefit from technologies and concepts spun off from that program or run collaboratively. 'I think more broadly, as all the services work together to make sure that they have complementary capability, ‘Where can we learn from each other?'' Franchetti asked. 'Where can we leverage that learning so you can be more common in the future?' While the Air Force NGAD initiative has been characterized by its secrecy, the equivalent Navy sixth-generation fighter program has been proceeding, if anything, even more in the shadows. It remains to be seen to what degree the pause on the Air Force program will affect the F/A-XX, but the release of any new details about the programs at this critical stage is of great interest, to say the least.

How The AIM-174 Could Pop China’s Anti-Access Bubble In The Pacif...	The Navy has officially acknowledged the existence of a weapon we had posited it was developing for years, an air-launched version of the hugely versatile, far reaching, and hard hitting ship-launched SM-6. Designated the AIM-174, this massive, F/A-18 Super Hornet-carried air-to-air weapon is by default longer-ranged than any other the U.S. has ever fielded. While it isn’t clear if the AIM-174 will also retain the SM-6’s secondary anti-ship and land attack capabilities, just what it could provide in the anti-air and possibly anti-ballistic missile roles could be truly revolutionary. Clearly built to take full advantage of the Pentagon’s emerging ‘kill webs,’ this is especially true when it comes to popping China’s vaunted anti-access bubble by going after its most prized force-multiplier assets. So, how exactly could this work and what does it bring to the table? We break it all down for you in detail in the video posted at the top of this troy.

Iranian Oil Tankers Bolting From Major Export Island Ahead Of Pos...	Iranian oil tankers have fled Kharg Island ahead of a potential retaliation strike by Israel which has vowed vengeance for Tuesday’s massive Iranian missile barrage. The island, handling 90% of Iran’s oil exports, is thought to be at the very top the reprisal target list for Israel. 'The National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC) appears to be fearing an imminent attack by Israel,' TankerTrackers reported on Twitter Thursday afternoon. 'Their empty [Very Large Crude Carrier] VLCC supertankers vacated the country's largest oil terminal, Kharg Island, yesterday.'

'We're in discussion of that. I think that would be a little… anyway,' Biden told reporters at the White House when asked if he supported Israel hitting Iran’s oil facilities. Many Israeli officials 'point to Iran’s oil facilities as a likely target, but some say targeted assassinations and taking out Iran’s air defense systems are also possibilities,' Axios reported. 'The Israeli response could include airstrikes from fighter jets as well as clandestine operations similar to the one that killed Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran two months ago.' This largely matches our analysis from Tuesday. Iran's Kharg Oil Terminal is high on the list of potential Israeli targets in any retaliation attack. (Photo by Fatemeh Bahrami/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images) Anadolu S&P Commodity Insights said oil and gas prices have already spiked globally after Iran's attack on Israel. 'Brent crude prices jumped 5% on Oct. 1 and global energy markets were on tenterhooks after Iran launched a new missile attack on Israel, sparking concerns of a major regional escalation and a direct conflict between Israel and Iran.' Prices could go higher should Israel attack Iranian oil facilities. Not only would that affect Iranian exports, but Israel too produces oil and could be hit by any Iranian response. 'The attack by Iran through missile strikes into Israel escalates the existing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah and Israel and Hamas, and likely puts at least some Israeli oil infrastructure, including 287,000 b/d of Israeli refining capacity, at greater risk,' oil analysts at S&P Global Commodity Insights said in a note. The company produced a map showing Iranian oil refineries Israel could potentially strike.

'We will respond, we know how to locate important targets, we know how to strike with precision and power,' said Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi. 'We have the capabilities to reach and strike any point in the Middle East. And those of our enemies who have not yet understood this, will soon understand.' Our analysis also pointed to Iran's oil infrastructure as the most likely target set for Israel to hit just after the ballistic missile barrage occurred. Not only would destroying the country's primary energy export terminal have major economic impacts for Iran, but accessing the target would be less complicated and risky for Israel than executing strikes deeper in Iran, especially against hardened nuclear or regime targets and/or dispersed military capabilities. Top DM/email question for me right now: What will Israel hit?Answer: I have no clear idea. Just some obvious possibilities, and they could always go an unconventional route, but if they strike at Iran's military, energy infrastructure, nuclear program, or other infrastructure…&mdash; Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) October 1, 2024 Still, Israel could always choose another route, including one less conventional. With the ongoing direct military operations now on two fronts, Gaza and Lebanon, the IDF certainly has its hands full and the big question then is what will Iran do in response to such a strike. The escalation ladder it steep and largely unexplored at this point.

Claims Swirl Around Israeli Strikes Very Near Russia’s Air Base I...	Israeli conducted strikes near the Syrian coast this morning, with explosions reported in the vicinity of the Russian-operated Khmeimim Air Base, near the city of Latakia. At this stage, it’s not clear if the Russian airfield was actually hit, deliberately or otherwise — which would be a first. Either way, however, the attacks represent a notable escalation in terms of Israel’s willingness to prosecute targets that are very close to this key Russian military facility in Syria and a major point of pride for Moscow. Three hours ago, Israel struck and destroyed a weapons depot at the Hmeimim base on the Syrian coast, shortly after the arrival of an Iranian weapons shipment.

POV 35.3721083, 35.9250677 looking North East pic.twitter.com/0uyylyvfr3&mdash; Rocket Man (@Grimm_Intel) October 3, 2024 Initial accounts from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a U.K.-based information office, describe attacks in the coastal Latakia province, with targets including an ammunition warehouse said to be near Jablah city, not far from Khmeimim Air Base. Weapons supplied by Iran and destined for Hezbollah, its Lebanese ally and proxy, often are delivered first to Syria, for onward transit to Lebanon. The suggestion here is that Iranian munitions headed for the militant group were targeted soon after they arrived in Syria. According to Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Avichay Adraee, Hezbollah has been recently smuggling weapons into Lebanon from Syria via the Masnaa border crossing. Only yesterday, the IDF released a video showing examples of Russian-made weapons it says its troops captured in Lebanon, including Metis-M anti-tank guided missiles, Strela-2 man-portable air defense systems, MRO-A rocket-propelled anti-personnel flamethrowers, and RPG-29 Vampire and RPG-27 Tavolga rocket-propelled grenades. The SOHR says that the warehouse in Jablah was destroyed and also reports the 'presence of warships in the sea, and warplanes believed to be Israeli.' The group says that Syrian and Russian air defenses were active for more than 40 minutes in an effort to thwart the attacks. The mention of Israeli Navy warships in the SOHR account is unusual, but it cannot be confirmed that these were the source of the attacks. Normally, Israel has used its fighter aircraft to conduct missions of this kind, although Israeli Navy warships have had a presence off Syrian shores. The Israeli Navy is not notably heavily-equipped for striking targets on land, although it’s possible that the latest Gabriel 5 anti-ship missile can also be used for land attack. An export version of this weapon, the Sea Breaker, is advertised as having a precision land attack capability, thanks to its imaging infrared seeker. Gabriel 5 missiles are used by the latest Sa’ar 6 class corvettes and may be fitted to older Sa’ar 5 class corvettes, as well. They are thought to have a range of up to 248 miles. Israel's submarine fleet is also capable of launching the secretive Popeye Turbo long-range cruise missiles, but those are thought to be only configured for nuclear strikes as they make up the country's second-strike deterrent. Another possibility, and one that would tally with reports of drones being in the air at the time of the attacks, is that Israel launched one-way attack drones or loitering munitions from warships or other vessels off the coast. As TWZ has discussed before, Israel has developed a ship-based version of its popular Harop drone. Standard versions could also be launched from containers on a ship's deck. Concept artwork showing the ship-launched Harop drone. IAI Reports on Syrian state television said that Israel was responsible for bombing Khmeimim Air Base 'an hour after the arrival of an Iranian plane belonging to Qeshm Airlines.' The same source claims that the Israelis’ targets were 'military sites in Latakia province' as well as a warehouse within the perimeter of the air base. 'The Israeli strike did not target the runways or towers at Khmeimim Air Base and Latakia’s civilian airport,' Syrian state television says.

Two years later, the Russian government signed a new long-term lease for the base with Syrian authorities, as part of a larger deal that also saw Russia extend its access to port facilities at Tartus, further to the south, for at least another 49 years. This arrangement came after Russian forces, especially combat airpower, had been instrumental in preventing the collapse of the regime of Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad. Now, the facility serves as the only Russian airfield on the Mediterranean, a highly strategic but also symbolic prize that Moscow gained in exchange for saving Assad.

The SOHR reports that an Israeli airstrike on the Syrian capital resulted in the death of Hassan Jaafar, the son-in-law of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. He was said to be one of three killed — with another three injured — when a building was flattened in the Mezzah district in the west of the city. Early reports indicate that #Hezbollah secretary-general Hassan Nasrallah's son-in-law, Hassan Jaafar Qasir, was killed in airstrikes on the Mezzeh neighborhood in Damascus on Wednesday, according to Sky News Arabic. pic.twitter.com/x2QOW54G9S&mdash; Jason Brodsky (@JasonMBrodsky) October 2, 2024 Israel has long been carrying out strikes against Iran-linked targets in Syria but has increased the intensity of such raids since last year’s October 7 attack by the Palestinian militant group Hamas on Israeli territory. These latest strikes are being carried out in addition to attacks on targets in Gaza, Lebanon, and Yemen. In the course of this year so far, the SOHR has documented 94 Israeli attacks on Syrian territory, comprising 77 airstrikes and 17 rocket/missile attacks by ground forces. In the process, the group says that Israel destroyed nearly 185 targets, including buildings, weapons and ammunition warehouses, headquarters, vehicles, and others. SOHR claims that the strikes killed 250 combatants and injured 177 others. Of those casualties, significant numbers are said to have been from the IRGC and Hezbollah. The majority of these attacks have targeted objectives in and around Damascus. The latest round of Israeli attacks is different, though, in that Israel has apparently targeted Iran-linked objectives — specifically, weapons destined for Hezbollah —in very close proximity to the most important Russian military hub in Syria. Perhaps, Israel has even deliberately targeted a facility at the air base itself, although that remains unclear. In either scenario, the incident is concerning for Russia and Syria in terms of air defenses. Khmeimim is the major hub for Russian air defense systems in the country, although repeated attacks by drones have raised previous questions about just how resilient this defensive umbrella is. Its current status is murky. On one hand tactics should have improved after years or war in Ukraine. On the other hand, Russia has shifted many air defense assets to that conflict. So, exactly what level of protection remains at the installation, at least as of yesterday, isn't clear. A Russian Pantsir-S1 low-level air defense system in Syria in September 2019. MAXIME POPOV/AFP via Getty Images Israel has previously hit targets very close to the Russian naval base at Tartus, prompting an angered reaction from the Kremlin. Again, weapons headed to Hezbollah appear to have been the targets. Israel historically also gave Russia advance warning about its attacks on targets in Syria, although this may well no longer be the case. For its part, Israel almost never comments on attacks of this kind within Syria, and satellite imagery of the base is so far inconclusive. The available low-resolution imagery from this morning shows everywhere but some of the main apron and core of the base’s operations and administration area but with no obvious damage or smoke. If this attack was indeed within the perimeter of the air base, it would appear that Israel has now decided that the risk is one worth taking if it’s to succeed in intercepting weapons before they get into the hands of Hezbollah in Lebanon. It would also indicate that this installation, while still technically belonging to the Assad regime, is being used for weapons transfers which Russia would likely be privy to. This would be a major change in what is publicly known about how this Russian-leased installation is used.

Surreal Missile Battle In The Sky Seen In Astonishing Video Of Ir...	It's rare we see a video that is truly unique — a scene or thing that has never been captured before. One incredible example of just such a thing is a video that has surfaced out of Jordan, supposedly near Amman, of the night sky taken with an infrared camera. It captured Iran's massive simultaneous ballistic missile barrage. In it, we see just how densely packed the sky was as these weapons careened toward their targets and Israel's and the United States' frantic work at countering as many as they could before they slammed into Israeli soil. The video, taken by Zaid M. Al-Abbadi who takes beautiful photos and videos of the night sky, looks like an immense meteor shower in a fantastical sci-fi movie or the last scene in a film that depicts the apocalypse — natural or manmade. It's both eerily beautiful and absolutely terrifying at the same time. This version of the video, posted here on Facebook, is the best we have seen. It shows some of the mid-course interceptor launches out of Israel even before the ballistic missiles come into view: View this post on Instagram A post shared by Zaid M.

Al-Abbadi (@zaidmalabbadi) Additional footage Source- pic.twitter.com/8EsaEJ5Izd&mdash; OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) October 2, 2024 The video is sped up about 10 times, but even then, just how fast this all occurred is dizzying. Also, this is just a portion of the sky, much occurred out of frame. Judging by the interceptor launches early on, this included at least some mid-course engagements. The higher volume of interceptors chewing away at the remarkably dense barrage were more likely to have been terminal ballistic missile interceptors, such as David's Sling, THAAD (if a battery deployed in-country), and possibly SM-6, but that is questionable. Israel retired its Patriot missile batteries earlier this year. You can read a complete breakdown of Israel's integrated air defense system here. It is very challenging to get a firm estimate of how many missiles were seen flying to their targets and how many intercepts occurred, but the numbers are very large on both sides, with dozens of intercepts seen in the video. The video made me immediately think of one of the most jaw-dropping set pieces in Andor: There is also a tour-de-force in physics being displayed in chaotic fashion, with what appear to be collisions, failures and even ricochets depicted. Above all else, this incredible video clearly displays what we long expected, that Iran would absolutely saturate the skies with a wall-like barrage of ballistic missiles in an attempt to overwhelm Israel's robust defenses. This clearly worked, at least to a degree, but where those missiles actually landed and how much damage was done remains a glaring question. Significant, albeit not widespread damage is already appearing in satellite images of one of Israel's key air bases. We also don't know what other measures were used to throw the missiles off track, including any 'left of launch tactics' and GPS jamming/manipulation. Regardless, the video certainly shows the kinetic measures that were put into play by air defenders in a desperate attempt to whittle down the sheer mass of the barrage.

U.S. Army AH-64 Apaches Practice Downing Drones With Hellfire Mis...	U.S. Army AH-64 Apache attack helicopters are refining their ability to detect and destroy enemy aerial drones while forward deployed to the Middle East, a region where the drone threat — especially from one-way attack munitions or 'kamikaze drones' — has exploded in recent months. Apaches have a little-known but proven capability to act in an air defense role against drones. This includes using their AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, which are traditionally air-to-ground weapons, to take them down. A recent video published by Central Command shows a U.S. Army AH-64D Longbow Apache attack helicopter destroying a target drone during the Red Sands exercise in Saudi Arabia. Red Sands is a joint Saudi-CENTCOM-sponsored exercise that focuses partially on counter-unmanned aircraft systems (C-UAS) capabilities, including trialing emerging countermeasure technologies. The Kingdom is no stranger to the threats posed by increasingly capable but comparatively inexpensive drones, especially the long-range one-way attack types. . @USArmy Soldiers engage an unmanned aerial system (UAS) from an AH-64 with upgraded Hellfire missile during Red Sands training exercise in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. @usarmycentral pic.twitter.com/HG9ChuWxt6&mdash; U.S. Central Command (@CENTCOM) September 30, 2024 The video shows a pair of Apaches targeting a drone with an AGM-114 Hellfire missile. The type used appears to be a variant or modification of the AGM-114L, which features a millimeter-wave radar seeker that is initially cued by the Apache's AN/APG-78 Longbow mast-mounted radar system. Combined, the radar and missile pairing allow Apaches to launch multiple Hellfires against ground targets — primarily vehicles — simultaneously and in any weather. The radar is capable of detecting and tracking some aerial targets, like lower-flying helicopters, but, as it may show in the video, detecting and engaging aerial drones could now be in its playbook as well.

Dean John Kd De Dios The use of AGM-114s and Apaches to swat down lower-end long-endurance drones is not new. Israel has been using the Apache in an air defense role for this purpose for years, which includes one well-known shootdown near the Syrian border of a Hezbollah drone. AH-64s were built with an austere air-to-air capability from the get-go, with the capacity to employ FIM-92 Stinger short-range heat-seeking missiles, but the Hellfire-Longbow combo could take this capability to a whole other level. It's also worth noting that the same general types of radar-guided Hellfires are being used on some Littoral Combat Ships to rapidly engage swarms of small boats. We have discussed in the past that this capability could also be adapted to taking down nearby slow and low aerial drones as well. AH-64 lets loose a Hellfire bound for a target drone during the Red Sands exercise. (CENTCOM screencap) The Apache's other weapons, like its 30mm cannon, can also play a role in counter-drone defense, but getting close enough and precisely targeting a drone with the gun system in such a fashion can be challenging and even quite dangerous, both in terms of the aerial dynamics at play and the fact that the drone likely carries a powerful blast fragmentation warhead. The highly destructive cannon rounds that do not connect with the target will also fall somewhere and at altitude this can be over a large area. Still, the gun has its uses against aerial targets, as seen in the video below.

APKWS joins a laser-guided control section to a standard 70mm Hydra rocket. APKWS has been tested with fighters in the air-to-air role and is now being used in a surface-to-air counter-UAS role in Ukraine. They are also far less costly than a Hellfire, coming in at around $25-30k per round compared to around $215k for an AGM-114 with the radar-guided L models costing even more. Still, $215k is relatively cheap compared to many modern air-to-air missiles and surface-to-air missiles. A laser weapon has been tested on Apache, but little is known about the status of that concept at this time. AH-64s also now have Joint-Air-to-Ground-Missile (JAGM) in their inventory with their multi-mode seeker capabilities, which could dramatically expand the helicopter's counter-drone efficacy even more. Not all of the U.S. Army's AH-64s — which include AH-64E Apache Guardians and some remaining AH-64D Longbows — carry the Longbow radar at all times, but the aircraft have the ability to share targeting information with others in their formation, so even if just one Apache has it, its data can be exploited by the flight. The Apache Guardian is a particularly highly networked asset beyond simpler intra-flight datalinks. This allows for greater situational awareness and connectivity with command nodes and other platforms in the battlespace, all of which could play a major factor in the drone defense mission. The evolving ability of the AH-64E to team with its own drone wingmen could also open up the C-UAS mission in unique ways, including drastically expanding area of defensive coverage a single aircrew can provide and bringing new distributed sensors to the fight. You can read all about the AH-64E's networking capabilities and manned-unmanned teaming operations in this previous feature.

Dean John Kd De Dios Apaches acting in this unique role have other advantages. Unlike ground-based air defenses, they can be rapidly repositioned and set up counter-drone screening wherever is most advantageous within their combat radius. They can also position forward, with ground forces if need be, and quickly take to the air in order to respond to incoming threats. Escorting ground forces and providing overwatch while also some drone defense capacity is another possibility and even protecting other airborne helicopters from enemy drones is a potential application for the concept. A radar-equipped Apache offers a networked and elevated sensor and weapons platform capability that is uniquely capable of detecting hard to spot, low and slow-flying targets amongst the ground clutter, although not over long distances. The fact that the Apache's radar can detect and track many targets at one time could potentially also allow for rapid engagements against swarms of incoming enemy drones where the timeframe to shoot will be very compressed. Hardware and software tweaks to the system may be needed to better acclimate the AH-64 to a robust C-UAS role, if that hasn't been fully realized already. Even with all these advantages, the AH-64 is still a helicopter with the speed and endurance limitations that go with it, but rotary-wing assets are increasingly playing a key role in the cocktail of measures being put into action to help counter the ballooning drone threat. The Red Sands exercise also comes at a very unique and troubling time in the region, with the multi-domain drone and missile barrages still being sent up regularly by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen and Iran and Israel teetering on the brink of a larger conflict. Tehran possesses massive numbers of long-range kamikaze drones spread amongst its forces and those of its proxies that would certainly be put into action if a larger conflict erupted across the Middle East, putting an expansive list of potential targets at risk. Under such circumstances, it will be an all-hands-on-deck effort to even attempt to counter these drones and the Apache could end up playing a tangible role in doing so. Regardless, let's hope its capabilities don't get put to the test.

World Braces For Israel’s Retaliation To Iran’s Ballistic Missile...	With Israeli leaders vowing to strike back strongly against Iran for Tuesday’s massive missile barrage, the world awaits Jerusalem's response. Fears are growing that continued escalation on both sides could lead to an all-out war in the region and possibly drag the U.S. into the fray. As we noted earlier today, the Chief of Staff of the Israeli Army said there will be retribution. 'We will respond, we know how to locate important targets, we know how to strike with precision and power,' said Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi. 'We have the capabilities to reach and strike any point in the Middle East. And those of our enemies who have not yet understood this, will soon understand.' *הרמטכ״ל בבסיס תל נוף: 'יש לנו יכולות להגיע ולתקוף בכל נקודה במזרח התיכון. ומי מהאויבים שלנו שלא הבין זאת עד עכשיו, יבין זאת בקרוב'**'יודעים שהחג לא שלם בלי החטופים. מחויבים להמשיך ולעשות הכל בכדי להחזיר אותם, וכואבים את החללים שנפלו'* הרמטכ״ל, רב-אלוף הרצי הלוי, ביקר היום… pic.twitter.com/ezwYYZCggC&mdash; Israeli Air Force (@IAFsite) October 2, 2024 On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran would 'pay for' the attack, which officials claim caused minimal damage. 'The regime of Iran does not understand our determination to defend ourselves,' Netanyahu said in a statement delivered shortly after the attack, which came on the eve Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year. 'They will understand. We will stand by the rule we established: Whoever attacks, we will attack them.' Many Israeli officials 'point to Iran's oil facilities as a likely target, but some say targeted assassinations and taking out Iran's air defense systems are also possibilities,' Axios reported. 'The Israeli response could include airstrikes from fighter jets as well as clandestine operations similar to the one that killed Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran two months ago.' This largely matches our analysis from yesterday. Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces, Maj. Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, said his country's next response will be 'even more devastating' should Israel retaliate.

'But ultimately, it’s up to them — as it is for any sovereign country — to make their own decisions.' There is also a concern that the U.S., with 40,000 troops in the region, could become involved should any of its naval, air, or ground forces come under attack. The U.S. has bolstered its presence in the Middle East since the Oct. 7, 2023 surprise Hamas attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 Israelis. Tens of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in Israel's ensuing response. One open-source intelligence researcher offered a breakdown of the various missiles on Twitter based on videos of the strikes and images of the recovered missile remains. Among them were Kheiber Shekan medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBM). It is a two-stage, solid-propellant, vehicle-launched MRBM that Iran first unveiled on Feb. 9, 2022. A third generation of the Fateh family of ballistic missiles, Iran claims it has a maximum range of 1,450 kilometers (900 miles).

So far, at least eight Israeli soldiers have been killed in the fighting, according to the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). Israeli troops looking over a village in Lebanon as they fight with Hezbollah. (IDF) The IDF did not say how those troops died, but most of the casualties took place in the eastern sector of southern Lebanon, according to a Twitter dispatch from the Israeli YNET media outlet. A half-dozen Israeli troops were killed and 30 more wounded in a battle in a Lebanese village, according to YNET reporter Yoav Zitun. The village, which he didn’t name, was struck 650 times in the past months by Israeli forces in anticipation of a looming ground incursion, Zitun stated. The casualties occurred after Israeli forces ambushed Hezbollah fighters in a building 'during heavy fog…and in total darkness.' An assault 'by dozens of [Hezbollah] terrorists began from every direction and in poor visibility with low cloud cover that made it difficult for air cover,' Zitun explained. 'That was followed by 'a barrage of anti-tank and paramilitary fire on the rescue forces that arrived to evacuate the first victims.' Zitun claims that 30 Hezbollah fighters were killed in that battle, another 30 wounded and 50 killed overall since the start of the invasion.

'They are especially focused on those who travel abroad or have relatives living outside Iran, the first official said.' 'Tehran grew suspicious of certain members of the Guards who had been traveling to Lebanon,' said a source, according to Reuters. 'Concerns were raised when one of these individuals began asking about Nasrallah’s whereabouts, particularly inquiring about how long he would remain in specific locations, the official added.'

U.S. Navy Destroyers 'Successfully Engaged' Iranian Ballistic Mis...	Multiple' Iranian missiles heading toward Israel on Tuesday were 'successfully engaged' by two U.S. Navy destroyers, a Navy spokesman said in a statement Wednesday morning. U.S. Sixth Fleet Arleigh Burke class guided missile destroyers USS Cole (DDG 67) and USS Bulkeley (DDG 84) 'engaged multiple Iranian ballistic missiles in defense of Israel from the Eastern Mediterranean Sea October 1, 2024,' Navy Capt. Bill Urban, lead spokesman for U.S. Naval Forces Europe/Africa said in a statement Wednesday morning. 'Multiple missiles are believed to have been successfully engaged at this time.' Both destroyers have 'the Aegis weapons system designed for ballistic missile defense and were stationed in the Eastern Mediterranean by the United States in advance of the Iranian launch as a part of U.S. Naval Forces Europe/Africa,' Urban added. The Navy released two videos showing interceptors being launched from the Bulkeley. The statement did not say what kind of interceptors or how many missiles were engaged. As we reported yesterday, about a dozen interceptors were launched against the Iranian missiles according to Air Force Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon’s top spokesman. He declined to confirm if they were Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) anti-ballistic missile interceptors. We reached out to the Navy for more details about the kind of interceptors launched and how many Iranian missiles were destroyed as a result. While it is possible the destroyers fired multi-purpose SM-6 missiles to engage the targets, that seems unlikely given where the Iranian missiles landed. SM-3s are used for midcourse engagements, while the targeted missile is flying outside the earth's atmosphere. SM-6s are used for more localized defense as the weapon is careening down toward the atmosphere during its terminal phase of flight.

Chinese Submarine That Sunk Had Exotic Hybrid Nuclear Powerplant:...	The mysterious Chinese submarine that apparently sunk in a shipyard earlier this year was the first of a new class featuring a hybrid nuclear/conventional propulsion system, according to a new report. The latest development in the saga of the Type 041 Zhou class submarine would seem to clear up some of the previous uncertainty about the boat as well as signal that China is working on novel solutions for its fast-growing underwater fleet. In a recent report citing unnamed defense officials, the Washington Times notes that the Type 041 'employs both conventional and nuclear propulsion,' specifically, 'a small nuclear reactor' in addition to a conventional powerplant. When the Type 041 was first identified in Wuchang Shipyard, it was assessed as being one of the Type 039A series boats, also known in the West as the Yuan class or a variant of it. The Type 039A is the first Chinese submarine with an air-independent propulsion (AIP) system, which greatly increases the time that it can remain submerged and makes it harder to detect, compared with traditional conventionally powered subs. A stock picture of a Type 039A or Yuan class submarine. via U.S. Navy Around a week ago, U.S. officials stated that the submarine in question had sunk and identified it as the first of a new class of boat, the Type 041 Zhou class. This was described as being a nuclear-powered attack submarine, or SSN, a type of boat that was not previously known to be built at the Wuchang Shipyard, which sits on the relatively shallow Yangtze River just outside the city of Wuhan. The yard is part of the state-owned China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC). The latest information from the United States suggests that the truth is somewhere in between, namely that the Type 041 features both kinds of powerplant. While still unconfirmed, this would make a lot of sense for several reasons and would also echo previous statements from Chinese officials. China military affairs analyst Rick Fisher told the Washington Times that, back in 2017, retired People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) Rear Adm. Zhao Dengping announced plans to develop a low-power/low-pressure nuclear reactor small enough to serve as an auxiliary engine for conventional submarines. A Soviet Juliett class conventional cruise missile submarine. One of these was equipped with a small nuclear reactor on a trials basis in the late 1980s. U.S. Navy Unknown Fisher says that the nuclear powerplant appears to be similar to a Soviet concept tested in the late 1980s on a single Project 651 Juliett class conventional cruise missile submarine. The ex-admiral said that the new reactor was intended to equip a 7,000-ton attack submarine that would also receive advanced weapons and electronics. He also said it would replace current AIP systems, as used in Type 039A. The concept of a hybrid propulsion system, with a nuclear reactor being used intermittently to charge batteries, or when a higher level of performance or longer range is needed, is an intriguing one, to say the least. Even before the possibility of hybrid propulsion was raised, it was notable that Chinese submarine developments were following a two-pronged path, with both nuclear- and conventionally-powered designs, in stark contrast to the all-nuclear U.S. Navy. Nuclear-powered submarines have the huge advantage of effectively unlimited range. Compared with conventionally powered alternatives, they are also faster and capable of staying submerged for time spans only limited to onboard provisions and maintenance demands. Even the most advanced AIP submarines, namely the ones that use fuel cell technology, still have to surface from time to time, including to refuel. This can be measured in weeks or less depending on how much energy is required during dive operations. On the other hand, conventionally powered submarines are invariably smaller and far cheaper to produce than their nuclear-powered counterparts. The latest AIP types also offer some capabilities that are similar to those of nuclear-powered attack submarines, albeit to a limited degree and only in certain ways. Notably, using lithium-ion batteries can provide extreme submerged endurance and very quiet operation and they are becoming an area of growing interest. The Japanese submarine Taigei, driven by an innovative propulsion system using lithium-ion batteries. JMSDF For China, specifically, a submarine that is small enough to operate with ease in littoral and shallower waters would be of huge interest. These points are of key importance for future contingencies in the South China Sea, or the Taiwan Strait, for example. Providing a smaller submarine with auxiliary nuclear propulsion, allowing it to remain at sea for an almost unlimited period, as well as for more extended periods submerged, would be better still. There is also the possibility that the Type 041 may combine its micro-nuclear reactor with lithium-ion batteries, meaning they can remain charged while fully submerged as needed, which would be a hugely significant development. Normally, a submarine with lithium-ion batteries needs to snorkel for charging, while the fuel cell is range-limited. An onboard nuclear generator could solve those issues. Meanwhile, putting these capabilities into a smaller hull should reduce costs and better contribute to the PLAN’s fast-growing submarine force. Size-wise, the Type 041 is reportedly around 10 percent longer than earlier attack submarines — like the Type 039A. The Type 039A is around 250 feet long, compared with around 360 feet for the Type 093 nuclear-powered attack submarine. This would make the Type 041 notably smaller and easier to move around than an SSN, while also making it suitable for construction at Wuchang Shipyard, which has previously not been used to build nuclear-powered submarines. &#8230;looking at multiple images of it, also appears to have an X-stern, a feature not seen before on any Chinese submarine.Measuring to the X-stern, what we can see of the new boat is over 80m long, compared to ~77m overall for the 039A. I'm guessing it's around 83-85m overall. pic.twitter.com/RUE1qIMA1q&mdash; Tom Shugart (@tshugart3) July 28, 2024 Quick thread on #Chinese submarine capabilities right now. Excuse typosFirst up.

We also know that it features an X-shaped stern. As we have discussed in the past, this feature is designed for improved maneuverability, efficiency, and safety, and also helps reduce the acoustic signature across significant parts of the submarine’s operating envelope. It would also appear to be optimized for operations in littoral and shallower waters. The stern section of the first Columbia class submarine, with X-form rudders, rides underneath the Jamestown Verrazzano Bridge heading to the General Dynamics Electric Boat plant in Quonset Point, Rhode Island. General Dynamics Electric Boat Whatever the plans for the Type 041, there’s also the fact that the first of these boats sunk, according to U.S. defense officials, raising questions about the status of the program and whether the boat is even salvageable. Citing unnamed U.S. officials, a report in The Wall Street Journal on September 26 describes the attempt by the Chinese authorities to cover up the accident, involving a submarine 'likely' carrying nuclear fuel when it sank. The boat had reportedly been undergoing its final fitting out before going to sea. There were no details provided about possible casualties in the accident, the possibility of which was first raised by Tom Shugart, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) think tank and a retired U.S. Navy submarine warfare officer, who identified unusual activity at the Wuchang Shipyard in June of this year. TWZ also examined satellite imagery showing the sudden appearance of four crane barges at the shipyard, as well as the disappearance of a submarine that had previously been in the berth.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION With the help of those four cranes, the submarine is said to have been salvaged, but getting it operational again will not be straightforward, with its internal spaces likely having filled with water, requiring the replacement of all the electronics and other systems. Chinese authorities have not commented on the incident and are unlikely to, especially since the submarine in question is a new design and one that incorporates several advanced — and possibly even unique — features. However, as more details about the Type 041 emerge, they shed light on the highly interesting nature of China’s submarine development program. On the one hand, the apparent sinking of the new submarine underlines questions that have been raised in the past about safety and quality control practices in Chinese naval shipbuilding. On the other hand, there’s no doubt that the expansion of the PLAN’s fleet, both surface and sub-surface is progressing very rapidly, even when it comes to large and/or complex vessels. With the latter point in mind, the Type 041 also seems to point to China’s willingness to explore new and advanced technologies as it seeks to field submarines that are best optimized for its requirements, including in terms of operating around the South China Sea, Taiwan, and other potential flashpoints in littoral and shallower waters.

B-52H Stratofortress Rocks Retro DayGlo Orange Paint Scheme	Oklahoma aviation photographer Rob Stephens recently captured some great images of a B-52H Stratofortress with the tail number 61-0028 as it was leaving Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma bound for Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. But this was not your ordinary 'BUFF.' Instead of the typical gray paint scheme, the jet, nicknamed 'Wolfpack,' sported DayGlo orange highlights on its forward fuselage, towards its wingtips, on its engine nacelles, and its vertical stabilizer. This striking paint scheme was done as a nod to the days when B-52A and B variants served as motherships for the North American X-15 experimental hypersonic rocket plane that the U.S. Air Force and NASA used for research purposes during the 1960s, among other mothership testing, Stephens told us. The B-52H Stratofortress 'Wolfpack' leaves Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma with a retro paint scheme honoring the days when earlier variants were motherships for the X-15 experimental rocket plane. (Redhome Aviation) REDHOME MEDIA CO The B-52 'arrived at Tinker in early 2024 for Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM) at the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center,' said Stephens, whose Redhome Aviation page features some stunning aircraft photos, including of the retro-painted Stratofortress. Tinker is where the 76th Aircraft Maintenance Group paint shop removed the old paint 'before the 565th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron performed detailed inspections and repairs to the 1960s-era bomber,' Stephens explained. After the PDM was completed, the B-52 'was flown on Aug. 26 by the 10th Flight Test Squadron, 413th Test Group, Air Force Reserve Command on a functional check flight lacking most of her paint,' according to the photographer. The 10th Flight Test Squadron conducted a functional check flight on Wolfpack in August. (Redhome Aviation) REDHOME MEDIA CO PDM involves a major overhaul and opportunities for important upgrades and modifications. As of 2021, each one of the service’s 76 B-52s was typically scheduled to undergo the months-long PDM process every four years. This scheduling is, of course, staggered to keep a certain number of bombers on active duty at any one time. Early indications of Wolfpack’s new paint scheme 'was her DayGlo orange rudder on her test flight, before the 76th AMXG repainted the aircraft in the standard gray with the DayGlo orange highlights' you see in the photo. The airframe was first flown with the new paint on Sept. 30 as 'Lobo49' and 'returned to the 49th Test and Evaluation Squadron at Barksdale, where she will receive her ‘OT’ and ‘49 TES’ tail markings, as well as an arrow on the tail and ‘U.S Air Force’ on her forward fuselage,' Stephens added. The aircraft was painted to replicate NB-52A 52-0003, he said. That aircraft, along with NB-52B 52-0008, completed the X-15 missions starting in 1959. High-altitude contrails frame the B-52 mothership as it carries the X-15 aloft for a research flight on 13 April 1960 on Air Force Maj. Robert M. White's first X-15 flight. (NASA) As we noted in our deep dive into the history of the Stratofortress, the first of three B-52A variants flew in August 1954 and were used exclusively for tests. The most famous of the test BUFFs was also a former B-52A, the NB-52A being permanently converted as a mothership for the X-15. It continued in this unique role until 1969.' Stephens told us that the paint scheme on the BUFF 'most closely resembles that of 52-0003 from 1959 with the X-15 mounted on the reinforced right pylon.' As it sits now, this B-52 with the boldest of heritage schemes will serve as the 49th Test and Evaluation Squadron's jet, doing very important work that will help allow the B-52 to remain relevant for decades to come, which is seen as critical to the service's future bomber roadmap. You can learn all about the B-52's future upgrades in our feature video below: We’ve reached out to both Tinker AFB and Barksdale AFB to find out more details about this aircraft. However, the next time you see a B-52 wearing DayGlo orange highlights, now you will know why.

Russian Pushes Deeper Into Key City In Eastern Ukraine	Russian troops have entered deeper into the embattled town of Vuhledar in eastern Ukraine according to the head of the Donetsk regional state administration and based on videos and photos posted by the Russians. Vuhledar has been an important bulwark against Russian advances in the region with its high ground and location between the eastern and southern fronts. Its fall, as we have previously reported, imperils the southern flank of Pokrovsk, a key regional logistics hub. 'The fighting is taking place within the city limits, so it is almost impossible to deliver humanitarian aid,' Vadym Filashkin, head of the Donetsk Regional State Administration said on Telegram Tuesday. '107 people still remain. Fortunately, all the children have already been evacuated from there.' Russian forces posted video and images of the tricolor flag waving atop a building there. Russian forces have advanced deeper inside Vuhledar to the most northwestern part of the city. In addition to our report yesterday, it is now quite safe to assume Ukraine no longer holds any presence inside Vuhledar. pic.twitter.com/e2xvuV5fsE&mdash; NOELREPORTS (@NOELreports) October 1, 2024 Russian channels posted videos showing the advance of Russian forces into western and southwestern Vuhledar, including elements from Russia's 5th Tank Brigade and 430th Motorized Rifle Regiment. pic.twitter.com/ggdmyoGelv&mdash; Rob Lee (@RALee85) September 30, 2024 As the Russians drew closer, Ukrainian troops said the only way out for soldiers still in the city late last week was on foot as they were hunted by drones and bombarded by artillery, The New York Times reported. 'There’s nowhere to hold ground,' one soldier from the 72nd Separate Mechanized Brigade, which has been defending Vuhledar, told the publication. 'The logistics are disrupted, making it almost impossible to stay there.' Beyond the strategic implications of losing Vuhledar are economic concerns. It was built atop two coal mines, where a significant amount of coal reserves remain, according to Reuters. Before the Russians entered Vuhledar, the brigade's commander said he was transferred to another unit. 'Gentlemen, officers, sergeants, soldiers! From the summer of 2022 to today, I had a long and difficult journey, Col. Ivan Vinnik wrote on the unit’s Telegram channel. 'But it was not difficult, because I did not overcome it alone. A loyal and motivated team was nearby.' Vinnik did not say where he was going or who would replace him. Col.

The past four months have been the deadliest of the war for Russian forces according to the U.K. Defense Ministry and its analysts say it is unclear how long they can sustain the current pace of operations. However, they have entered Vuhledar as they continue to chew up territory in a slow and deadly grind through Donetsk. The next weeks will tell us more about how much Ukrainian forces have buckled and how well they can defend the rest of the region, much of which does not have the same advantages of elevation and large buildings that provide some form of cover. The Latest The Russians appear to be continuing efforts to build out their defenses near the twice-attacked Kerch Bridge. New satellite imagery obtained by The War Zone shows the construction of what could be permanent barriers to the north and south of the bridge. In the upper portion of the image, you can see what looks like pilings driven into the seabed to create what could be a kind of fence to protect the bridge. There are two sections south of the bridge, one forming a line running east to the section of the span allowing shipping to pass through and another to the west of that opening. There is similar construction taking place north of the bridge. Nearly three dozen barges placed south of the bridge, lined up in two rows, are now in place as well, allowing a fairly narrow passage. It's also possible these new additions could be for another use, such as for a pipeline. Construction work on a possible barrier can be seen just south of the railway portion of the Kerch Bridge. There are also 34 barges set up in two rows to protect against sea drones. PHOTO © 2024 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION. A closer view of what could be barrier construction on either side of the Kerch Bridge. PHOTO © 2024 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION. An even closer view of what could be barrier construction to protect the Kerch Bridge. PHOTO © 2024 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION. If these are indeed barriers, they would be designed to stop Ukrainian uncrewed surface vessels (USV) from striking the bridge. It was severely damaged in July 2023 by a Ukrainian Sea Baby drone boat attack and before that by a truck bomb in October 2022. As we noted last week, Russia is also building flak towers near the bridge to house Pantsir air defense systems. You can see those towers in a video shot by someone crossing the bridge. Last year, the head of Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Directorate vowed that Vladimir Putin’s prized $4 billion span linking Russia to the Crimean peninsula it occupies will come down. 'It’s not a question of will we strike or won’t we strike,' Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov told us last year during an exclusive interview from his hotel room while he was visiting Washington, D.C. 'We’re doing that regularly so we will finish it. It’s just an issue of time.' Whether Budanov’s promise is fulfilled remains to be seen. However, the images potentially showing additional defensive lines being built around it is further evidence that Russia is taking that threat seriously. LATEST: On the battlefield, the heaviest fighting continues to take place in Ukraine’s Donetsk region while the invasion of Kursk Oblast in Russia grinds on, according to the latest assessment from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). Kursk: Ukrainian forces recently advanced in Glushkovsky Raion west of the Ukrainian salient while geolocated footage published on September 29 indicates that Ukrainian forces 'recently advanced west and northwest of Veseloye (south of Glushkovo) and likely seized the northwestern part of the settlement,' ISW reported.' Russian forces counterattacked near the Ukrainian salient in Kursk Oblast on September 29, but did not make any confirmed advances in the area.' Kharkiv Oblast: Russian forces continued offensive operations in northern Kharkiv Oblast on September 29 but did not make any confirmed advances. Luhansk Oblast: Russian forces continued offensive operations along the Kupyansk-Svatove-Kreminna line on September 29 but did not make any confirmed advances. Donetsk Oblast: Russian forces made no confirmed advances northeast of Siversk near Bilohorivka, east of Siversk near Verkhnokamyanske, and southeast of Siversk near Vyimka as well as in the Chasiv Yar direction and west of Donetsk City on September 29, including near Vuhledar. However, they 'recently marginally advanced in Toretsk amid continued assaults in the area on September 29' as well as southeast of Pokrovsk.

The latest planned increase in spending will take Russia’s defense budget to a record 13.5 trillion rubles ($145 billion) in 2025, according to draft budget documents published on Monday on the parliament’s website. That represents an increase of about 3 trillion rubles ($6 billion) more than was set aside for defense this year, which was the previous record, The Guardian noted All told, spending on defense and security 'will account for about 40% of Russia’s total government spending – or 41.5 trillion rubles in 2025,' the publication reported. That’s about $437 billion. The 2025 budget 'suggests Putin has embraced what economists have dubbed 'military Keynesianism', marked by a significant rise in military spending, which has fuelled the war in Ukraine, spurred a consumer spending boom and driven up inflation,' according to The Guardian. 40% of public spending in Russia will go to defense&#8230;If the West would take its own sanctions seriously, the Russian economy would tank in no time ! Guy Verhofstadt (@guyverhofstadt) October 1, 2024 Ukraine will receive a new tranche of U.S.-made GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs (SDBs) as part of a $6.9 billion sole-source contract awarded to Boeing. 'Work will be performed in St. Louis, Missouri, and is expected to be completed by Dec. 31, 2035,' according to the Pentagon. Bulgaria and Japan will also receive SDBs through this contract, though the Pentagon does not say how many will go to each country. @air_winged via X The 250-pound guided bombs with pop-out wings have a range of up to 40 nautical miles. Dropped by Ukrainian MiG-29 Fulcrum fighters, the SDBs have been used to great effect by Ukraine, which first disclosed it had begun employing them in May. They have 'proved resilient to jamming,' according to The Washington Post, in an article published in May citing confidential internal Ukrainian assessments. The same article notes that 'nearly 90 percent of dropped [Small Diameter Bombs] struck their target.' The War Zone has previously examined the potential for Ukraine to arm its donated F-16 fighters with SDBs, noting specifically the advantages the munitions provide in terms of accuracy, standoff range, ability to strike semi-hardened static targets, and the large numbers in NATO stockpiles to draw from. In contrast, the Ground Launched Small Diameter Bomb (GLSDB) variant of the weapon has been much less successful, and highly susceptible to jamming. Able to strike targets at a distance of around 94 miles, each GLSDB weapon combines the SDB with the rocket booster motor from a 227mm-caliber M26 artillery rocket that can also be fired by the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS and the M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS). Ukraine is one of three countries, along with Bulgaria and Japan, that will receive new tranches of Small Diameter Bombs. (U.S. Air Force photo/Master Sgt.

Iranian Ballistic Missiles Rain Down On Israel	Iran has begun its latest retaliation against Israel with a barrage of ballistic missiles. Information is only now starting to emerge, but there have been serious concerns that Iran may be poised to strike Israel in support of the Hezbollah militant group, of which it is the main sponsor, as well as in vengeance for the assassination of Hamas's top political leader in Tehran two months ago.

The same source said there were no direct clashes with Hezbollah fighters reported overnight.

Overnight, targets of the IDF are said to have included the towns of Marjayoun, Wazzani, and Khiam – which sit in a series of interlocking valleys overlooked by steep slopes – were being shelled on Monday night. Quoting the IDF, the Israeli media says that the operation is being led by the 98th Division, an elite formation of paratrooper and commando units, supported by the 7th Armored Brigade. The 98th Division was previously operating in the Gaza Strip, as part of the war against Hamas.

This is one of at least 20 settlements that have received evacuation orders, others including Metula, Misgav Am, and Kfar Giladi in northern Israel. There are contradicting accounts from Hezbollah about the situation on the ground in the border area. One Hezbollah spokesperson told Reuters today that Israeli troops had not entered Lebanese territory, but that Hezbollah would be ready to fight them if they did. Meanwhile, two Lebanese security sources told the same agency that Israeli units had crossed into Lebanon overnight for reconnaissance and probing operations. There has been at least one claim from Hezbollah of its troops engaging IDF soldiers near the Lebanese border towns of Odaisseh and Kafr Kila, 'achieving confirmed casualties.' This has not been independently confirmed. Hezbollah’s deputy leader, Naim Qassem, yesterday said that 'the resistance forces are ready for a ground engagement.' In his first speech since the targeted killing of the group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, Qassem added: 'We know that the battle may be long. We will win as we won in the liberation of 2006,' he said, referring to the 2006 war.

Over the weekend, Lebanon’s health ministry said that more than 1,000 Lebanese have been killed and 6,000 wounded in the past two weeks, while a million people have fled their homes. Multiple casualties were reported after an Israeli strike that is said to have targeted a building at the Ain al-Hilweh refugee camp near the southern city of Sidon. An unconfirmed report from the Israeli media states that the attack injured Mounir Maqdah, the commander of the Lebanese branch of the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a Palestinian armed group active in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

Hezbollah says it has fired more missiles toward Israel, including at least one example of the Fadi 4 ballistic missile, apparently used for the first time. The new missile is said to have targeted Glilot Base near Tel Aviv, home to the IDF’s Unit 8200 and the headquarters of the Mossad intelligence agency.

However, this is by no means a new development, with Israeli concerns already having led to extensive measures being taken to curb the flow of weapons being transferred to Hezbollah from Iran. Israel continues to target these stockpiles aggressively and meanwhile, Hezbollah’s ability to use them has been hampered by Israeli operations that have inflicted heavy blows on the group’s communications and command and control networks. Israel’s long-awaited ground operation in Lebanon was approved by the country’s cabinet, according to Israeli media reports, after a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The buildup to the current IDF ground operation in Lebanon included the campaign of deadly explosions targeting pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah members two weeks ago and the airstrike last week that killed Hassan Nasrallah, in Beirut. The IAF has continued to strike targets in Beirut, as well as launching long-range attacks on Yemen and Syria. Over the weekend, dozens of IAF aircraft were involved in airstrikes on the Iran-backed Houthi militants in Yemen, which the Israeli military says is the longest-range combat mission since the 1985 raid on the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) headquarters in Tunis. You can read more about these latest Yemen airstrikes here. Today, the Houthis claimed they had launched drone strikes against IDF posts in Tel Aviv and Eilat. Meanwhile, in Syria, the official news agency Sana early today reported Israeli strikes in the Damascus area. The agency claimed that Syrian air defense systems had intercepted three rounds of strikes. Sana reported at least three civilians killed and nine others wounded in the attacks.

Still, the IAF has repeatedly launched attacks on Iran-linked targets in Syria for years, with a notable uptick after the start of the latest Middle East conflict in October last year. Israel has also revealed details of previously secret operations in the lead-up to Northern Arrows, including efforts to locate and destroy weapons belonging to the Radwan Force, the special operation units of Hezbollah. Since the beginning of the year, the IDF says its special forces have carried out around 70 operations into southern Lebanon, resulting in the capture of 30 tons of explosives, thousands of weapons including advanced anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles made in Russia, Iran, and China, heavy machine guns, ammunition, and more. Most of these are said to have been taken from Hezbollah’s extensive network of tunnels and basements near the border. הותר לפרסום: כוחות מיוחדים של צה'ל ביצעו מתחילת השנה כ-70 מבצעים חשאיים בדרום לבנון, לאיתור והשמדת יכולות רדואן של חיזבאללה.מעל ל-30 טונות חומרי נפץ, אלפי אמצעי לחימה ובהם טילי נ'ט ונ'מ מתקדמים מתוצרת רוסיה, איראן וסין, קלאצ'ים, מקלעים בהם כבדים, מצלמות, תצ'אות ומפות מעודכנות,… pic.twitter.com/k5htGldxBe&mdash; יואב זיתון (@yoavzitun) October 1, 2024 Ever since Israel said it was committed to returning to their homes the thousands of its citizens who fled Hezbollah rockets near the northern border, the expectation has been that a ground operation would be launched. Before its people can return to homes in the border area, Hezbollah’s ability to use short-range rockets, mortars, drones, anti-tank missiles, and snipers first needs to be severely degraded. In recent weeks, Hezbollah has been rocked by Israeli decapitation operations and airstrikes that have already greatly reduced its fighting potential, but it remains to be seen how long it will take Israel to achieve its goal and at what cost to both sides, as well as the Lebanese civilian population.

Israeli Ground Offensive In Lebanon Has Begun: Reports	Detailed information is currently scarce, but there are now numerous reports that Israel has launched a new ground operation in Lebanon. The scale of this remains to be seen, with accounts earlier today of several small-scale raids across the border into Lebanon. For some months now, a larger Israeli operation in Lebanon had been expected, with Israeli officials apparently recently telling their U.S. counterparts that a 'limited' ground operation was about to begin.

Meanwhile, at least one U.S. official has said that Israel appeared to be planning a major ground invasion, but that the plan now appears to have been 'significantly scaled down.' There were also reports earlier today suggesting that Israel may not yet have made a final decision on a broader operation. Meanwhile, there are eyewitness accounts, videos, and photos posted to social media that show the rapidly ballooning deployment of Israel Defense Forces (IDF) units — including tanks and armored fighting vehicles — close to the border with Lebanon. Around a hundred vehicles, including Merkava tanks and Namer armored personnel carriers, are visible in visuals from this spot near Ayelet HaShahar in northern Israel, about 8km from Lebanon. Reuters, NYT, Getty all have photos from the site (credits in ALT text). pic.twitter.com/gb62Ru8X1u&mdash; Christiaan Triebert (@trbrtc) September 30, 2024 The IDF has declared the areas around the communities of Metula, Misgav Am, and Kfar Giladi in northern Israel, near the border with Lebanon, as a 'closed military zone.' Entry to areas around those areas is now prohibited, the IDF has said. Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant said today that the 'next phase of the war against Hezbollah will begin soon,' while in separate comments he told troops in the north of the country that 'we will use all of our capabilities — including you.' The Lebanese Army appears to have made the conclusion that an Israeli ground offensive is more likely than not. There are now plenty of reports indicating that Lebanese troops are withdrawing from the border area close to Israel. Citing local residents and security sources, Reuters reports that the Lebanese military is pulling back from 'several positions on the southern border with Israel,' although a Lebanese Army spokesperson would neither confirm nor deny such reports. A Lebanese security source told Reuters that Lebanese troops have pulled back to at least three miles north of the border, while another source talked of the troops having been pulled back to larger army bases in the area. Lebanese troops have pulled back from posts along the border with Israel, residents there and several security sources told @reuters One security source said they have pulled back at least 5km.

Sept 30 (Reuters) - The Lebanese Army was seen withdrawing from several positions on the southern border with Israel, local residents and a security source told Reuters.&mdash; Idrees Ali (@idreesali114) September 30, 2024 For its part, Hezbollah has been launching rockets into Israel from the border area in recent days, while Lebanon came under heavy Israeli aerial attack. On Friday, Israeli airstrikes on Beirut killed Hassan Nasrallah, the veteran leader of Hezbollah, and much of the group's leadership. You can read our coverage of this decapitation strike here. While Hezbollah says it will continue to fight Israel, the fighting potential of the group has been severely degraded in the past couple of weeks. Israeli decapitation operations, including exploding pagers and walkie-talkies, as well as airstrikes, have removed not only Nasrallah but also many of his associates. Key facilities housing Hezbollah weaponry and personnel have also been relentlessly struck. The success of these operations may well be reflected in the scale of the ground offensive that looks set to follow. Another key factor is Israel’s stated plan to return tens of thousands of Israelis who had been evacuated from towns along the northern border with Lebanon when Hezbollah stepped up its campaign of rocket attacks. With the return of these evacuees having been approved by Israeli officials, a major military operation against the militant group began to look much more likely. The U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, and other senior U.S. officials have been monitoring and responding to 'unfolding events in the Middle East' over the weekend, according to Matthew Miller, a U.S. State Department spokesperson. Miller today said he will let Israel 'speak to its own military operations', including the 'timing, purpose, tempo of those' operations. Whatever shape those operations take, it now appears more likely than not that the conflict in the Middle East has reached a critical new juncture. This is a developing story. We will update it as more news comes in about this apparent new offensive.

Mysterious M60 Machine Gun Contract Awarded By U.S. Army	The U.S. Army has awarded a contract worth nearly $15 million to U.S. Ordnance for an unspecified number of 7.62x51mm M60E6 and M60E4 machine guns, and/or kits to convert older M60s into either of those configurations, as well as ancillary items and training. The service announced its interest in buying these guns, which the U.S. military largely stopped using decades ago, earlier this year, but was curiously tight-lipped about for whom and why. The weapons could be intended for a foreign ally or partner, such as Ukraine, or to support some other operational, test and evaluation, or training requirements. The Pentagon included the new deal with U.S. Ordnance for 'M60E4 and M60E6 machine guns, spare parts and accessories, conversion kits, and training,' which is valued at $14,960,325 and came via the Army's Contracting Command-New Jersey (CCNJ), in its daily contracting announcement last Monday. 'Work locations and funding will be determined with each order, with an estimated completion date of Sept. 21, 2029,' the Pentagon's notice adds without elaborating on who might be the intended recipient of the guns. Neither the M60E4 nor the M60E6 are known to be in any kind of widespread Army service currently. A member of the Danish armed forces with an M60E6 machine gun. US Army In January, CCNJ posted a sources sought notice about an essentially identical potential purchase of M60E4/E6s and/or conversion kits, as well as associated items and services. That notice also asked prospective contractors to 'describe your maximum deliverable quantity of all the above M60 systems and conversion kits within 60 days' and indicated a desire for up to 500 guns, at least within that timeline. The notice added that the requirement for the guns came from the office of the Program Manager for Soldier Lethality (PM SL) and the Combat Capabilities Development Command-Armaments Center (CCDC-AC), but did not provide more specific details about who would be receiving the weapons or why they were needed. 'PM SL is prohibited from releasing details that may violate operational security,' a spokesperson for that office told The War Zone in January when asked about the purpose of the then-proposed acquisition and who might be set to get the M60s. 'Please contact OSD(PA) [Office of the Secretary of Defense Public Affairs] for announcements of DoD support activities and force posture changes related to Ukraine,' that same individual said when asked about whether the M60s might be part of a future military assistance package for that country. 'OSD(PA) retains release authority for announcements of DoD support activities and force posture changes related to Ukraine.' 'Beyond the information reflected in the contract notice, we do not have any additional details to release at this time,' a spokesperson for the Office of the Secretary of Defense also told The War Zone in January. The War Zone has reached back out to PM SL and OSD for more information now that a contract has been awarded. A member of the US Army fires an M60E6 machine gun during training with Danish and other NATO allied forces in Estonia in 2018. US Army The Army started development of the original M60 in-house in the late 1940s, leveraging design elements from Nazi Germany's FG-42 automatic rifle and MG-42 machine gun. The service adopted the M60 in the 1950s, fielding it as a weapon that could be used by dismounted infantry, as well as mounted on various platforms. More specific subvariants intended for internal and external use on vehicles, helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, and ships and boats were subsequently developed. These early Cold War variants of the M60 were widely exported. Decades-long efforts to lighten and otherwise improve the core design resulted in the M60E3 variant in the 1980s. Empty with a standard 22-inch barrel, the E3 weighed just under 19 pounds compared to the nearly 23-pound standard infantry model of the M60. Even lighter and more compact E3s fitted with short 16.6-inch 'assault' length barrels became particularly associated with the U.S. Navy SEALs, as well as a fixture in popular media like 1985's Rambo: First Blood Part II. A US Navy SEAL with a short-barrelled M60E3. DOD However, the changes to the E3 resulted in reliability and other issues. The M60E4 was designed to rectify those problems and further improve the design, and had a weight of around 23 pounds like the original infantry variant when fitted with a standard-length barrel. This version competed against and lost to what became the Army's now-standard M240B machine gun in the 1990s. The SEALs, as well as other Navy units, subsequently adopted a subvariant of the E4 with a short 17.3-inch barrel, which was designated the Mk 43 Mod 0. Another variant with rails for mounting optics, aiming lasers, and other accessories on the gun's top cover and handguard was developed and became the Mk 43 Mod 1. The Mk 48 machine gun, a 7.62x51mm cousin of the 5.56x45mm M249 Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW), has since supplanted the Mk 43 series. U.S. Ordnance, the main manufacturer of M60 variants today, treats the M60E4 and the Mk 43 series as functionally identical. A member of a US Navy Naval Mobile Construction Battalion, or Seabee, mans a Mk 43 Mod 0 machine gun mounted on a Humvee in Iraq in 2003. DOD Though they have not enjoyed the same success export-wise as the original M60, M60E4/Mk 43-series guns, as well as E3 variants, have also made their way into service with military and security forces outside of the United States. The Philippines Marine Corps and that country's Naval Special Operations Command are particularly prominent examples. In the early 2010s, U.S. Ordnance introduced the M60E6 with further improvements and reduced weight (around 20 and a half pounds with a standard-length barrel) over the M60E4/Mk 43. The Danish Army became the first customer for this new M60 variant in 2014. M60E6s are also now in service in the Philippines and Indonesia. A Philippine Naval Special Operations Command with what appears to be an M60E6 during an exercise with US forces in 2024. USN Petty Officer 1st Class Joseph Rolfe It remains possible the Army's new M60 purchases are part of a forthcoming military aid package for Ukraine. The U.S. military likely has substantial numbers of older M60s in storage readily available for conversion into E4/E6 types, as well, which could then be transferred to the Ukrainian armed forces. After the U.S. government said last year that it had run out of funds for more military aid for Ukraine, the Excess Defense Articles (EDA) program was raised as one option for keep assistance flowing. Under EDA, materiel that meets certain stipulations to be deemed excess to U.S. military requirements can be sold very cheaply or transferred via a grant to foreign allies and partners. Other current and former operators around the world, including many NATO members, could be sources for older M60s for conversion to newer variants, as well. The Army's new M60 contract could have nothing to do with Ukraine, as well. The guns could be for an entity within the Army or elsewhere inside the U.S. government, or some other foreign ally or partner. As previously discussed, M60E4/E6 types are already in service elsewhere outside of the United States. It is worth noting that the Army was able to respond without issue to questions about a similarly unusual potential purchase of Soviet-designed 5.45x39mm AK-74 assault rifles, or certain variations thereof, last year. As it turned out, the service was interested in acquiring those guns to meet an internal training-related requirement. With the contract for the M60E4/E6s now awarded, more details about where they are headed and how they will be used might begin to emerge.

Israeli 707 Tanker’s Secretive Remote Vision System Revealed In L...	The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have released a video showing portions of the long-range strike mission flown against Houthi targets in Yemen yesterday. The footage confirms that F-35I Adir stealth jets as well as F-15C/D fighters were involved in the attacks, part of an intensified campaign that Israel is now waging against the Iran-backed Houthis, as well as Hezbollah in Lebanon, and Hamas in Gaza. Intriguingly, the video also provides what is very likely our best (if not only) view so far of the little-known remote vision system used in the Israeli Air Force’s Boeing 707 tanker, seen while topping up F-35s over the Red Sea. Footage From the Refueling Aircraft on the Way to Strike Houthi Military Targets in YemenThe Israeli Air Force's refueling aircraft have been operating in all arenas in the war, providing fighter jets with flexibility in strikes and aerial operations at any distance.Yesterday… pic.twitter.com/o8TRNAtC8l&mdash; Israeli Air Force (@IAFsite) September 30, 2024 The video published today by the IDF shows aerial refueling operations as part of the strike against infrastructure in Yemen used by the Iran-backed Houthi militants. The footage starts with the takeoff of an IAF 707 tanker including views from the flight deck, after which the refueling jet flies in formation with F-35s. A portion of the Saudi Arabian coastline, including the city of Al Humidah can also be seen, from the perspective of the tanker. As for the F-35s, these appear to be carrying exclusively internal ordnance and they are not fitted with radar-reflective Luneburg lenses which remove the stealth jet’s radar-evading qualities.

We got a previous view of the screen of the remote vision system back in July of this year when the 707 supported F-35s in another long-range IAF raid on Yemen. But on that occasion, it was just video from the camera feed itself, not of the actual boomer interface that controls the system. בהמשך לתקיפות בלבנון ביממה האחרונה, מצורף תיעוד מתדלוק מטוסי אדיר מעל שמי לבנון ותיעוד מיירוט כטב״ם על-ידי מסוק קרב: pic.twitter.com/YUul4bCMVs&mdash; Israeli Air Force (@IAFsite) August 25, 2024 Essentially, the equipment used on the Israeli 707 is a much earlier conceptualization of the technology now used on the U.S. Air Force’s KC-46 Pegasus. In this more recent application, however, the complex Remote Vision System (RVS) has proven to be a particular source of problems. In both the Israeli 707 and the KC-46, the boom operator performs their tasks from the main cabin via an array of cameras at the back of the plane that feeds into the RVS. In both cases, a hybrid 2D/3D system is used, requiring the operators to wear special glasses. Boom operators sit at their workstations wearing their specialized glasses in the main cabin of a KC-46A. U.S. Air Force A largely unprecedented view of the Re'em's RVS. (IDF screencap) Perhaps the most surprising facet of this is that Israel developed and fielded a remote vision system that seems to function without any lingering difficulties, and did so many years ago, while the U.S. version used in the KC-46 is still mired in delays. We still don't know exactly how bad the teething of this older Israeli system was when it was introduced many years ago. Another modern remote vision system has meanwhile also been developed and introduced by Airbus, on the A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT). An Israeli Air Force Boeing 707 tanker demonstrates refueling hookups with F-15 fighters over Hatzerim Air Base. JACK GUEZ/AFP via Getty Images Israel has a limited number of 707 aerial refueling jets. (JACK GUEZ/AFP via Getty Images) As well as aerial refueling, the 707 used in the Yemen raid will likely also have served as a command and control station and communications node. The aircraft is equipped with a satellite communications suite ensuring critical, secure beyond-line-of-sight comms with appropriately equipped tactical aircraft like the F-15 and F-16 and command centers far away. This is especially important in long-range strike operations, with the 707 helping enable real-time remote command and control and enhanced situational awareness, intelligence sharing, and other functions. In this way, targeting information, for example, can be shared between all the aircraft on the active network and can be exchanged with command centers and other aircraft across considerable distances. Some Israeli Air Force 707 tankers also execute other missions, including networking and command and control functions. Tomás Del Coro/Wikicommons Some IAF 707 tankers also execute other missions, including networking and command and control functions. Tomás Del Coro — wikicommons The current IAF 707 fleet started to enter service in 1979, with then-newer 707-300 airframes replacing previous 707-100s. Known by the Hebrew name Re’em, meaning oryx, the aircraft were acquired from commercial airlines and then began to be adapted locally for aerial refueling. The conversion was done by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) and was a long process, only finally being completed in the 2010s. Details about the current remote vision system are hard to come by and technical details have been relatively closely guarded. Reportedly, as well as the 3D glasses, the system incorporates a foot-operated communications system, meaning the boomer’s hands are kept free to operate the console. Otherwise, based on what we can see in the video, the boomer’s screen is surrounded by very dated-looking analog instruments, reflecting the overall age of the interface installation. Israel's 707 tankers, thought to number roughly just seven airframes or so, are absolutely prized possessions for the IAF. They enable long-range strike capabilities that have allowed Israel to reach out over long distances to prosecute high-priority targets since the 1980s. They would be absolutely critical players in even a limited air operation against Iran, not just providing fuel, but also aforementioned networking and command and control capabilities. Ultimately, the IAF will replace its geriatric 707 fleet with KC-46s, with a deal for eight of the new tankers having been approved. We don’t yet know when Israel will receive its first KC-46s, but by the time they arrive, they should have a fully functional RVS, with the 2.0 version of the system expected to be delivered starting in April 2026. Other interesting details of the latest raid on Yemen have been provided in other videos and photos from the IDF. Yesterday, another video released by the IDF revealed details of preparations by an IAF strike package consisting of F-15C/Ds, known locally as Baz, which were seen taking off from their base at Tel Nof, in central Israel, purportedly headed for Yemen. These venerable fighters, which have a dual air defense and strike role, were seen fitted with conformal fuel tanks and loaded with 2,204-pound SPICE 1000 precision-guided glide-bombs, as well as AIM-7 Sparrow and AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air missiles, and Elta 8222 self-escort electronic warfare pods. Also in the video are 2,000-pound Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM), although these are not seen fitted on the jets. המראת מטוסי ה-״בז״ (F-15) לתימן מבסיס תל נוף pic.twitter.com/uQfk6ysDIB&mdash; Israeli Air Force (@IAFsite) September 29, 2024 Live 2,000-pound JDAMs lined up in front of an Israeli Air Force F-15 in its shelter. IAF screencap While the AIM-7 is an increasingly anachronistic weapon, TWZ has previously explored the continued use of this missile to arm IAF F-15s, noting that the older Sparrow has a warhead that is double the size of the one used in the AMRAAM. However, the AMRAAM still possesses far superior range, is far more flexible overall, better allows for fighters to engage multiple targets at once, and has a true fire-and-forget capability, making it sensible to carry examples of both. On the other hand, the threat posed by Houthi fighters is strictly limited, with little chance that they would risk taking on the IAF, provided they had the opportunity to do so. In certain scenarios, the Sparrow is likely also more suitable for engaging hostile drones — not least due to the fact that it’s a cheaper option and stocks may be close to becoming time-expired.

Muyovu (@kirkjamestkirk) September 30, 2024 The fact that the aging F-15C/D still plays a key role within the IAF is something we have explored in the past and it has also helped influence continued interest in procuring new versions of the F-15, alongside the fifth-generation F-35. Meanwhile, these heavily modified F-15s are central to the air arm’s ability to conduct long-range operations as well as homeland defense and they have been used as multirole air-to-air and air-to-ground platforms for decades. According to the IDF, 'dozens' of aircraft were involved in the Yemen airstrikes on Sunday, which the Israeli military says are its longest-range combat mission since the 1985 raid on the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) headquarters in Tunis — a mission that also involved F-15s. According to the IAF, its aircraft flew upward of 1,120 miles to attack the Houthi targets yesterday. As well as one or more 707 tankers, these 'dozens' of IAF aircraft would have included the strike and escort packages of F-35s and F-15s and a variety of intelligence-gathering assets, almost certainly including some of the airborne early warning and control and signals intelligence platforms based on the Gulfstream bizjet airframe. The latest of these is the Nachshon Oron, a multi-mission intelligence-gathering aircraft that you can read more about here.

The focus of yesterday’s attacks appears to have been the ports of Hodeidah and Ras Issa, with targets including the docks as well as fuel facilities and powerplants. Israeli authorities say that the ports are being used to 'transfer Iranian weapons to the region, and supplies for military needs, and thus also oil.'

Residents described power cuts across most of Hodeidah. IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi released a statement after the strike: 'We know how to reach very far, we know how to reach even farther, and we know how to strike there with precision.' 'This is not a message; it is an action. An action that carries a message with it,' Halevi added. In an unusual move, the IDF flew a CNN journalist, Nic Robertson, aboard the 707 during yesterday’s mission. During the flight, an IDF spokesperson said that the strikes were in response to the Houthis firing three long-range missiles against Israel in the past two weeks; all of those missiles were intercepted near Tel Aviv, the spokesperson said. According to the Houthis, the most recent of these attacks, on Saturday, targeted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Ben Gurion International Airport, outside Tel Aviv, as he arrived back from a visit to the United States.

You can read our coverage of those attacks here. The United States has meanwhile confirmed suspicions that versions of the 2,000-pound GBU-31 JDAM were used to strike Beirut. Senator Mark Kelly, the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Air-Land said that U.S.-made 'Mark 84' bombs equipped with JDAM kits. 'We see more use of guided munitions, JDAMs, and we continue to provide those weapons,' Kelly said on NBC. 'That 2,000-pound bomb that was used, that’ s a Mark 84 series bomb, to take out Nasrallah.' The bombs used were BLU-109s, which is a penetrating bunker-buster warhead, or variant of them, also with a nominal weight of 2,000 pounds. In the wake of the raids that killed Nasrallah, the IAF released videos and photos showing at least eight F-15I strike fighters carrying 2,000-pound-class penetrator JDAMs. At least some of those aircraft carried seven of the JDAMs each.

The group said that one of those targeted a group of Israeli soldiers, while others reportedly struck areas in northern Israel, according to officials there. Despite the death of Nasrallah and the vast majority of its upper echelons in recent Israeli attacks, Hezbollah says it will continue to fight Israel. Since the start of the Gaza war, almost a year ago, there have been concerns that fighting between Israel and Hezbollah could draw in Iran, and other Iran-backed proxies, sparking a larger regional conflict. It seems that yesterday’s long-range strike mission against the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen was not only intended to degrade the militants’ ability to attack Israel but was also a very clear warning to Iran not to become more deeply involved. Whatever happens next, the operations so far have revealed some fascinating and surprising aspects of Israeli capabilities, from exploding pagers on the one hand to our best look at the remote vision system on Israel’s veteran 707 tankers on the other.

Russia Training To Launch FPV Drones From Helicopters To Counter ...	Russia is now training its troops to use helicopters to launch first-person view (FPV) drones to counter Ukraine’s uncrewed surface vessels (USVs). New video released by the Russian Tactical_13 Telegram channel is the first time we have seen Russians using a helicopter this way. The video shows one Russian donning the FPV goggles while another grabs an FPV drone, opens the door, and lets it out over the water. The operator’s view shows the drone flying low over the surface, but no USV in sight. Because, why not: Special Forces of the Russian Black Sea Fleet training to destroy kamikaze USVs from helicopter using FPV drones. pic.twitter.com/Y34I8jFtP6&mdash; Clash Report (@clashreport) September 30, 2024 Using a helicopter as a FPV drone mothership in this way makes a lot of sense. You can greatly expand the reach of FPV drones by delivering them forward via a mothership aircraft. Generally, the FPV drones have a maximum range of about a dozen miles, but operationally usually it's much less than that. They require continuous line-of-sight communications with their controllers. However, their range can be maximized by avoiding terrain that can interfere with their signal. Elevated antennas and relays installed on balloons or placed on unmanned or manned aircraft, like a helicopter, can extend their connectivity much further with more consistent connectivity. You can read all about this in our previous piece here. FPV drone mothership/relay concept of operations. (Tyler Rogoway) In this case, the helicopter is both the delivery system and the control node. Operating over water and having the controller well above the surface in a helicopter means that the absolute maximum range and flexibility can be squeezed out of these drones. This also fits with a broader move to more advanced 'air launched effects' drones that are launched by a mothership aircraft, but this cruder version of the concept makes realizing even a basic capability like this much more attainable. FPV drones are capable of hunting for USVs, popularly known as drone boats, while also acting as precision-guided munitions nimble enough to chase them down and destroy them, although it’s always harder than it looks. Using helicopters to launch FPVs is another iteration in the development of drone combat in this war, where FPV drones have dominated the battlefield. Aerial suicide drones have been used to attack boats before, so it makes sense that Russia has moved to the maritime interdiction environment focusing on countering Ukrainian long-range drone boat attacks. Launching FPV drones from helicopters would allow Russia to cover wide swaths of the Black Sea. Being able to strike Ukrainian sea drones before they can get close to a port or ships is far preferable to relying on close-in weapons from a vessel or shore defenses, booms, and other impediments in a port. The following video shows Ukrainian drone boats being blown up in Sevastopol harbor. #war Another video of the breakthrough ofdrones on Sevastopol harbor in the early morning of March 22. One of them was stopped by a booms at the entrance to the harbor and exploded. Two others managed to jump over the booms and they were destroyed already in the harbor. pic.twitter.com/3bWHShWwEx&mdash; Capt(N) (@Capt_Navy) March 23, 2023 Russia has used FPV drones to attack Ukrainian sea drones before. What was purported to be the first recorded instance of that emerged in May, which you can read more about here. It was unclear whether video from the time showed an attack on an operational or captured Ukrainian USV. However, the head of Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR), Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, told us at the time that Russia had been using FPV drones to attack Ukrainian drone boats for several months. You can see video of that encounter below. Launching and controlling them via helicopter will allow for responding faster to these threats much farther out then using FPV drones launched from land or vessels. Unfortunately, Russians are using FPV drones to destroy Ukrainian naval drones It is unclear when and where the encounter happened, pic.twitter.com/HyTVaJOnxH&mdash; PS01 △ (@PStyle0ne1) May 29, 2024 The use of helicopters to defend against Ukrainian drone boats is a well established tactic. The War Zone first reported in May that the Russian Defense Ministry (MoD) released video it said was an R-73-equipped Ukrainian USV coming under attack from a Russian Navy Ka-29 Helix-B assault helicopter. The USV performed some hard maneuvers to try and escape the Ka-29 but was eventually destroyed, apparently by gunfire. At major suspected target areas, including ports and infrastructure, helicopters are used by the Russians to spot and engage marauding drone boats. Ukraine’s sea drones have caused widespread havoc on Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, with attacks on ports in Crimea and ships. They have been so devastating that Russia has moved the bulk of its BSF from Crimea to Novorossysk in Russia. Ukrainian Sea Baby drones were used to attack the Kerch Bridge in July 2023. These attacks have served as a lesson in asymmetrical warfare, where one side with an extremely limited navy can pin down a much larger force with numerous surface and subsurface combatants. It is natural that Russia would seek to change this equation by doing for the Black Sea what FPV drones have done for ground warfare in Ukraine and Russia. Launching FPVs and controlling them from a helicopter overhead is also likely to quickly migrate far beyond the conflict in Ukraine, with special operations aircrews are already using and perusing similar concepts but with higher-end weapons, many of which offer less flexibility than the FPV drone does, at least over short distances, and cost far more per round. But in the meantime, we will have to watch to see if Russia finds success with this new FPV drone application. Considering how this war has progressed, we will likely find out sooner rather than later.

Russian Su-35 Shown ‘Headbutting’ American F-16 At Very Close Ran...	North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) has posted a video of an 18th Fighter Interceptor Squadron (18th FIS) F-16C executing an intercept on a pair of Russian Tu-95MS Bear-Hs and their fighter escorts off Alaska. The video in question shows a Su-35S Flanker executing a very close-range 'headbutting' maneuver, cutting in front of and across the Viper's path. It's the most dramatic video we have seen of such a close encounter since a B-52 crew experienced a similar incident over the Black Sea a few years ago. The video posted by NORAD, taken by a 360-degree action cam placed in the F-16's cockpit, shows how alarmed the Viper pilot was with the Su-35's maneuver: 'On Sept 23, 2024, NORAD aircraft flew a safe and disciplined intercept of Russian Military Aircraft in the Alaska ADIZ. The conduct of one Russian Su-35 was unsafe, unprofessional, and endangered all – not what you’d see in a professional air force.' – Gen. Gregory Guillot pic.twitter.com/gXZj3Ndkag&mdash; North American Aerospace Defense Command (@NORADCommand) September 30, 2024 The original press release from September 23 about the intercept noted four Russian aircraft were involved: 'The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) detected and tracked four Russian military aircraft operating in the Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) on September 23, 2024. The Russian aircraft remained in international airspace and did not enter American or Canadian sovereign airspace. This Russian activity in the Alaska ADIZ occurs regularly and is not seen as a threat. An ADIZ begins where sovereign airspace ends and is a defined stretch of international airspace that requires the ready identification of all aircraft in the interest of national security. NORAD employs a layered defense network of satellites, ground-based and airborne radars and fighter aircraft to track aircraft and inform appropriate actions. NORAD remains ready to employ a number of response options in defense of North America.' Unprofessional & dangerous conduct by a VKS Su-35S (B/N '24' Blue / RF-95493) assigned to the 22nd Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment (based at Tsentralnaya Uglovaya, Primorsky Krai). Guy Plopsky (@GuyPlopsky) September 30, 2024 It's worth noting that the 18th Fighter Interceptor Squadron is unique in the U.S. Air Force. As we previously reported, the unit was previously designated the 18th Aggressor Squadron (18th AGRS) but was redesigned the 18th FIS earlier this year. This occurred after performing the alert air sovereignty mission to backfill F-22 Raptors based out of Elmendorf Air Force Base in Anchorage for some time. The growing demand for F-22 taskings around the globe resulted in the aggressors based to the north at Eielson AFB increasingly standing in for the Raptors in an alert augmentation role. This led to some very interesting situations where F-16s wearing Russian-like camouflage would be intercepting real Russian aircraft, usually over the Bering Sea. While some of the unit's F-16s now wear a standard scheme, others do not and still partake in the alert missions. As it sits now, the 18th FIS performs both aggressor missions and alert taskings on a regular basis, making it unlike any other unit in the force.

U.S. Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Carson Jeney Airman 1st Class Carson Jeney As for the 'headbutt' maneuver, as we have reported on for many years, while deemed unprofessional at very close ranges, these types of antics have gone on for decades, being wholly commonplace during the depths of the Cold War. They have taken on new meaning and become more prolific in recent years as the global security situation shifted for the worse, with Russia and the United States, as well as many of its allies, being directly opposed to one another over the war in Ukraine. China is also notorious for executing similar stunts that have also included actually dumping radar-reflecting chaff into the path of the targeted aircraft, which raises major safety concerns. That being said, the USAF uses the 'headbutt' maneuver to gain the attention of wayward aircraft as well, but not in such an aggressive manner. As for Russia's activity near Alaska, it has spiked in recent months alongside that of China, which is now extending its power-projection capabilities in the air and at sea, with Alaska being a major focus. This included the first flight of Chinese H-6 cruise missile carriers off Alaskan shores and an increased Russian-Chinese naval presence in the area. This has prompted the U.S. Defense Department to allocate more resources to the highly strategic area, including sending naval assets there to keep a close eye on and deter Russian and Chinese air and naval operations, which are spiking as of late. With the Arctic being of increasingly great importance, tensions between Russia and the United States climbing, and China becoming more comfortable with long-range military operations, the 18th FIS and their F-22s partners are likely to be busier than ever in the coming months and years.

Russians Advancing On Kharkiv Region City Ukraine Liberated In 20...	While most of the heavy fighting in Ukraine is concentrated in the Donetsk region, Russia continues to push toward the city of Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast. Located about 60 miles east of Kharkiv City, it is a regional administrative headquarters and sits astride a key railway. Russian forces are now less than five miles to the northeast and less than 10 miles to the southeast. The Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff reported 20 battles in the area on Friday and claimed its forces repelled Russian advance attempts on the nearby towns of Sinkivka, Glushkivka, Lozova, Stelmakhivka and Kolisnikivka.

It rushed troops from the Donbas to defend it, leaving that region more exposed. Back in September 2022, Ukraine liberated Kupiansk as part of its stunning and successful offensive in that region. It was a high point for the nation a half-year after Russia launched its all-out invasion. While its fall does not appear imminent, the fact that Kupiansk is again under siege is another troubling sigh of Ukraine's hard-fought gains being eroded. The Latest Elsewhere on the battlefield, Russian forces continue to push forward in eastern Ukraine, where towns like Pokrovsk, Toretsk and Vuhledar remain in peril. According to the Institute for the Study of War’s (ISW) latest assessment, Russian forces ' recently advanced east and southeast of Pokrovsk amid continued offensive operations near Pokrovsk on September 26.' Ukrainian forces 'maintain positions in Vuhledar and Kostyantynivka amid continued Russian offensive operations southwest of Donetsk City on September 26. The Ukrainian brigade defending in Vuhledar reported that Ukrainian forces are maintaining positions in the settlement in response to recent Western reporting to the contrary.' In Kharkiv Oblast, Russian forces 'recently reportedly made marginal advances north of Kharkiv City, but there were no confirmed changes to the frontline' in the northern part of that region on September 26.

'So, we’re going to sit down (to) just discuss it, and if we have a win, I think long before I, before January 20, before I would take the presidency – it’s January 20 – but long before that, I think that we can work out something that’s good for both sides. It’s time,' Trump added. 'By the way, the president (Zelensky) knows that too. He wants to get something done. He doesn’t want to do this.' 'I think we have common view that the war in Ukraine has to be stopped, and Putin can’t win, and Ukraine has to prevail, and I want to discuss with you the details about that,' Zelensky said. The meeting took place even after Trump, openly skeptical about providing additional aid to Ukraine, mocked Zelensky. While Zelensky has yet to release the plan, it is said to include requests for ongoing Ukrainian security guarantees as well for additional long-range weapons and the permission to use them deep in Russia. After the meeting, Zelensky expressed gratitude toward Trump, calling their meeting 'very productive.' He added that the two men 'thoroughly reviewed' the situation in Ukraine and the consequences of the war for Ukrainians. I had a very productive meeting with @realDonaldTrump.

During a meeting of the Russian Federation Security Council standing conference on nuclear deterrence, Putin announced a draft proposal for changes to his country’s nuclear doctrine. It includes the possibility of using nuclear weapons in the event of a massive launch of non-nuclear weapons against Russia. He did not mention Ukraine but inferred that actions taken by Kyiv and its allies could push Moscow over the nuclear threshold. 'The updated version of the document is supposed to regard an aggression against Russia from any non-nuclear state but involving or supported by any nuclear state as their joint attack against the Russian Federation,' Putin said. The proposal also 'states clearly the conditions for Russia’s transition to the use of nuclear weapons.' Under the plan, Russia will consider using nuclear weapons 'once we receive reliable information about a massive launch of air and space attack weapons and their crossing our state border. I mean strategic and tactical aircraft, cruise missiles, UAVs, hypersonic and other aircraft.' Russia reserves 'the right to use nuclear weapons in the event of aggression against Russia and Belarus as a member of the Union State. All these issues have been agreed upon with the Belarusian side and the President of Belarus. Including the case when the enemy, using conventional weapons, creates a critical threat to our sovereignty.' 'In conclusion,' Putin said, ' I will note that all the updates have been deeply calibrated and are measured against contemporary military threats and risks to the Russian Federation.' Putin suggests changes to Russia's nuclear doctrine.'An aggression by a non-nuclear state with the participation of a nuclear state is proposed to be considered as their joint attack on Russia,' Putin said during a Security Council meeting. The Kyiv Independent (@KyivIndependent) September 25, 2024 One analyst suggested that Putin's announcement falls between 'cheap talk' and 'state-sponsored rhetoric.'

Umerov noted that Ukraine is currently discussing the necessary number of air brigades and fighter jets, according to a translation by The New Voice of Ukraine. Umerov also emphasized that while last year’s focus was on pilot training and building the required infrastructure, this year the priority is to 'secure air superiority.' 'We already have commitments from partners for the F-16s. Consultations are ongoing regarding the Gripen and Eurofighter,' Umerov said. As we previously reported, Sweden is keeping the door open for a possible transfer of Gripens, allocating $220 million in a recent aid package to Ukraine to purchase new 'material kits' for its operational JAS-39C/D Gripen fighters. That’s so those jets won’t have to be cannibalized for parts to be used in the newer Gripen-JAS-39E variants, making them potentially available to Ukraine.

Plans To Axe Special Operations Surveillance Planes Come Under Th...	How U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) expects to fill the capability and capacity gaps that will be created by the planned retirement of U-28A Draco and Beechcraft King Air-based surveillance aircraft is coming under increasing scrutiny. SOCOM and U.S. Air Force officials have repeatedly stressed that while ditching the U-28As and King Airs will free up resources to help field its new OA-1K Sky Warden light attack aircraft, the latter is not a replacement for the former. The Government Accountability Office (GAO), a Congressional watchdog, confirmed to The War Zone earlier this week that it is currently conducting a classified review of SOCOM's decision to divest the U-28As and King Air-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft, the latter of which are often referred to collectively as MC-12s. This is separate from GAO's already extensive and still ongoing assessments of the Armed Overwatch program that led to the OA-1K, a single turboprop-engined light attack aircraft based on the Air Tractor AT-802 crop duster. The OA-1K Sky Warden. L3Harris 'SOCOM told us that their decisions about Armed Overwatch occurred separate from their decisions to divest of existing aircraft,' a GAO spokesperson told The War Zone. 'We are separately conducting a classified assessment of SOCOM’s process for how it decided to divest of ISR aircraft.' 'SOCOM plans to divest two ISR platforms. Subsequently, some personnel and resources from the platforms will be used to support Armed Overwatch,' GAO said in an unclassified summary of its assessments to date of the Armed Overwatch program that was released earlier this month. 'However, GAO found that SOCOM has not taken steps to plan for, or add, critical ISR capabilities provided by soon-to-be divested aircraft. Also, SOCOM has not addressed risks associated with the loss of these capabilities if the new aircraft does not provide them.' A U-28A Draco. USAF MC-12W Liberty aircraft like the one seen here are among the ISR-configured Beechcraft King Air variants currently in service across the U.S. special operations community. USAF The exact sizes of the current U-28A and King Air ISR fleets are not entirely clear. In a report published in December 2023, GAO said that close to 40 U-28As and around 15 ISR-configured King Airs remained in service. The Draco is a militarized version of the Pilatus PC-12M single-engine turboprop, while the members of the Beechcraft King Air family are twin-engine turboprop types. U-28As and MC-12s carry different, but similar mixes of sensors, including electro-optical and infrared video cameras and signals intelligence (SIGINT) suites. A graph showing the OA-1K (Armed Overwatch), MC-12, and U-28 fleet sizes as of Fiscal Year 2023 and how they are expected to change by the end of the decade. GAO There is also uncertainty now around the expected size of the OA-1K fleet. In its Fiscal Year 2025 budget proposal released earlier this year, SOCOM revealed plans to shrink the total Sky Warden purchases down to 62 from 75. 'Our requirement still remains 75 [OA-1Ks] based on what we've determined,' Air Force Lt. Gen. Michael Conley, head of Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), told The War Zone and others at a media roundtable on the sidelines of the Air & Space Forces Association's main annual conference last week. 'I think it still provides a cost-effective close air support platform, which is one of the missions that it was designed for. It's still going to provide an ISR capability.' The OA-1K can carry camera turrets and other sensors in pods under its wings, but these will only provide limited capabilities compared to the integrated ISR suites found on the U-28A and King Air variants. As already noted, SOCOM and the Air Force have now made clear that they do not see the Sky Warden as a replacement capability-wise for any existing crewed fixed-wing surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft. At the annual SOF Week conference in May, SOCOM officials said that they working on new aerial ISR requirements that could lead to more direct successor to the U-28A and King Airs. A graphic showing a ‘maximum strike load’ configuration for the Sky Warden that includes a sensor pod with a pair of camera turrets. Air Tractor Inc. A core underlying issue in all of this is the broader shift in focus across the U.S. military to preparing for future high-end fights, especially a potential one against China in the Pacific, after decades of counter-terrorism and other lower-intensity missions. The U.S. special operations community, which had been at the forefront of operations during the Global War on Terror era, is at a particular watershed moment now. This has had a direct impact on planning around the OA-1K and SOCOM's crewed fixed-wing ISR fleets, as well as other special operations unique aircraft like the AC-130J Ghostrider gunship. 'From when OA-1K was conceptualized and decided on until now, the world’s changed a little bit,' Lt. Gen. Conley said last week. 'But as we move forward, I think there’s opportunity to look at, again, some novel mission sets. …how quick can we get the wings on and off it so we could use it in some sort of crisis response, if we needed to? Where does the role of SIGINT [signals intelligence], or ELINT [electronic intelligence] or… some sort of ISR collect [factor in] there. I think there’s opportunity for that. Again, not anything we’ve committed to yet.' When it comes to discussions about crewed fixed-wing ISR capabilities, especially in a world full of ever-more capable and steadily proliferating air defense threats, this broader debate extends beyond just the U.S. special operations community. The U.S. Army has also been divesting significant numbers of turboprop surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft, fleets that had ballooned in size in the past 15 years to support operations in places like Iraq and Afghanistan. That service is now looking at a new mix of aerial ISR capabilities that includes modified business jets and high-altitude balloons. King Air-based types like the MC-12S Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (EMARSS) seen here are among the turboprop ISR aircraft the US Army has also been divesting in recent years. US Army AFSOC's Conley also stressed at the AFA conference this year that while the primary focus of America's armed forces now is being ready to execute major combat operations against a near-peer opponent, this doesn't mean that lower-end missions will evaporate. A central argument behind the Armed Overwatch program has always been the value of having cheaper alternatives to tactical combat jets, bombers, and other aircraft for conducting light attack and ISR missions in permissive environments. A concept of operations like this also frees up other aircraft for higher-priority missions, or just allows them to not have to fly as much, helping to reduce maintenance and logistics costs. Aircraft like the Sky Warden have the additional benefit of being able to operate with minimal footprints at far-flung locations closer to their mission areas without the need for already heavily in-demand tanker support. That proximity also helps when it comes to time on station, which has its own cost implications. The price to operate fast jets and other aircraft for bases further afield to conduct short-endurance sorties can quickly add up. 'I tell my team every day [that] the Pacific is incredibly important to us for all the reasons – you know, Secretary [of the Air Force Frank Kendall has put emphasis on] China, China, China – we get it,' the head of AFSOC explained. 'But we've also got a rest of world mission that I'm responsible for, as well.' 'We still have a global mission. &#8230; I don't think we're done in CENTCOM,' he continued, referring to U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. military operations across the Middle East, which is currently in the throes of a number of major crises in which the U.S. military is embroiled to differing degrees. 'And I think there's probably some disconnects in how we analyze what the future fight will look like.' Lt. Gen. Conley also noted that his command is 'still digesting' the latest of GAO's assessments on OA-1K and that there is 'some reconciliation we still need to do' with regard to the Congressional watchdog's work to date. AFSOC, as well as SOCOM, will now also have to do the same with regard to whatever comes out of GAO's separate review of the plans to shed the U-28As and King Airs, which may have new impacts on U.S. special operations aviation plans going forward.

Israel Executes Massive Bunker Buster Strike On Hezbollah Command...	Beirut has been rocked by huge explosions, with Israel confirming that it carried out airstrikes against Hezbollah’s main military headquarters in the Lebanese capital. Information is still emerging, but Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah is said to have been the target, while this afternoon’s raids were the biggest to hit Beirut since the start of the current conflict in the Middle East, almost a year ago. In Beirut this afternoon, a series of explosions were heard across the city, leaving multiple huge plumes of dark smoke. Smoke was even visible from the city of Batroun, roughly an hour’s drive north of the Lebanese capital.

The Last Viper Commander: Dutch Squadron Boss On Today’s Retireme...	After 45 years of service, including multiple combat deployments, the F-16 was formally retired today by the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF). Ahead of today’s flight and retirement ceremony, TWZ spoke to Lt. Col. Patrick 'Naish' Vreeburg, the commander of 302 Squadron, the final RNLAF F-16 operator, who reflected on the type’s service — and what comes next. As for the Dutch F-16s, these will almost certainly see more combat again before too long, with two dozen refurbished jets to be transferred to Ukraine. Lt. Col.

From here, seven of the last Dutch F-16s (and one Belgian) took off for a farewell flight, taking them over key locations associated with the Viper’s long career in the country. Among the places flown over were the Netherlands Ministry of Defense in the Hague and the Air Force Headquarters in Breda, as well as other bases where the F-16 was previously based. Brig. Gen.

RNLAF/YouTube screencap First off, it’s worth recalling the key facts and milestones associated with the F-16 in Dutch service. The Netherlands was one of the first four European Participating Air Forces (EPAF) to sign up for the F-16 as part of the so-called ‘Sale of the Century,’ primarily to replace its aging F-104 Starfighter fleet.

The first order was for 102 F-16s, comprising 80 single-seat F-16As and 22 two-seat F-16Bs. The first Dutch-built F-16 took to the air on May 3, 1979, and an initial delivery to the RNLAF followed in June of the same year. An F-16AM operated by the U.S.-based RNLAF training unit, from Luke Air Force Base, Arizona. Frank Crébas In December 1983, the Dutch government approved plans to buy another 111 F-16s (97 F-16As and 14 F-16Bs), the last of which was rolled out of the Fokker production facility in February 1992. By then, however, the Cold War was over and the security landscape in Europe looked very different. In 1993 it was decided that only 138 of the jets would pass through the Mid-Life Update (MLU) program, rather than the 170 originally planned. The MLU was completed in 2003, the same year in which it was announced that the fleet would be reduced again, by 25 percent. The steady downsizing of the Dutch Viper fleet provided opportunities for other operators. Beginning in 2005, Jordan acquired six F-16BMs, while Chile acquired a first batch of 18 jets (11 F-16AMs and seven F-16BMs) in the same year, followed by another batch of 18 single-seaters in 2008. An F-16AM from 312 Squadron over the North Sea. Frank Crébas The Dutch first took the F-16 to war over the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s, under Operations Joint Falcon and Allied Force. During the latter campaign, on April 4, 1999, a Dutch F-16 shot down a Serbian MiG-29 Fulcrum fighter with an AIM-120 AMRAAM missile, for the first RNLAF aerial kill since World War II. Dutch F-16s also struck Serbian ground targets in the same operation, including using AGM-65G Maverick air-to-ground missiles. Subsequently, RNLAF F-16s flew missions over Afghanistan under Operation Enduring Freedom, with the jets initially based in Kyrgyzstan. Dutch F-16s also took part in the NATO air campaign over Libya, followed by counter-IS missions in the Middle East. Regular deployments were also made to the Baltics as part of NATO’s Baltic Air Policing rotational mission, to defend the airspace of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. While the F-16 was originally acquired by the RNLAF with the expectation that it would fly short-range air defense and battlefield interdiction with ‘dumb’ munitions during a war with the Warsaw Pact, the post-Cold War world put very different demands on the jet and its operators. An RNLAF F-16 driver prepares for a night mission. Frank Crébas Nevertheless, the F-16 excelled at out-of-area operations and extended deployments far from the Netherlands. On more than one occasion, for example during the operations in Afghanistan and Iraq/Syria, a political decision was made and, only a couple of days later, Dutch F-16s would be flying in theater. With such an illustrious career behind it, it’s no surprise that Lt. Col. Vreeburg has some mixed feelings about the F-16’s retirement. 'Of course, it’s a big moment,' he told TWZ. 'After 45 years of operating the F-16 in the Royal Netherlands Air Force and a lot of deployments over the last 20-plus years, and very important tasks before that during the Cold War. But we need now to focus on our people and our assets, to transition to the F-35 to provide a credible deterrence.' Vreeburg admitted that his job as commander of 312 Squadron has meant that he’s been almost too busy to reflect on the retirement of the F-16, a jet that has played a huge part in his service career, its cockpit providing his ‘office’ for the last 23 years. An RNLAF F-16AM configured for air defense ejects an infrared flare. Frank Crébas 'I’ve been on 10 deployments with the F-16,' Vreeburg explained. 'We had a lot of adventures together, and it flies… like heaven. It really flies like a razor blade. Almost as soon as you even think about turning, it already goes. I don’t know how it’s going to be on the F-35. I’m lucky that I’m transitioning to the F-35 so I will keep flying.' The first F-35s arrived at Leeuwarden on October 31, 2019, and the RNLAF now has 40 of the 52 units already ordered, with more planned. That changeover is something that Vreeburg likened to trading in your first car for a new model. 'You had a lot of adventures with it, and now it’s served its purpose… it cannot bring you any more to where you need to go, and so you need something else, but you keep fond memories of it.' Of those 10 combat deployments, Vreeburg recalled them as being 'all memorable in their own way. The first one, and then the first one as a flight lead. And then the first deployment that flew out of Afghanistan instead of from Kyrgyzstan into Afghanistan. Then you had Libya. Then you had Iraq. I think one of the most memorable of my deployments to Kandahar was when we had the Battle of Chora, when we, together with the Netherlands Army, went onto the offensive to take that valley back. At one point we had the whole battle group from the Netherlands Army, with all six aircraft, even including the spares, all above that valley at the same time, combating the Taliban. So that was one of the most memorable deployments I had.' With Smokewinders on the wingtips, an F-16AM flies over some typical Dutch countryside. Frank Crébas While combat deployments finished with the end of the Operation Inherent Resolve rotations, until the beginning of this year, RNLAF F-16s were still undertaking some quick reaction alert (QRA) air defense duties, of Benelux (Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg) airspace, Vreeburg explained. 'We still did one month of standby duty, 24/7, with a small group of pilots and maintainers. We had a small group of aircraft to perform that mission. We also still had the DCA [dual-capable aircraft], our nuclear mission. At the end of February, we transitioned the QRA task to the F-35 and at the end of May we transitioned the DCA task also to the F-35.' An RNLAF F-16AM flies alongside the first Dutch F-35A. Frank Crébas Vreeburg continued: 'After that, we focused still on investing in our people. We still had some flight lead upgrades going on and we did some mission commander upgrades. We also did a deployment just before the summer break to Norway, where we flew support for the weapon instructor course, as ‘red air.’ We used that deployment to train our people in deploying and operating from an unfamiliar airfield. We finished up the last flight lead upgrade a couple of weeks ago, and meanwhile, besides that, we were mainly, especially since the summer break, flying support for the F-35 as red air, but also as blue air, because they also need entities to protect in their training. We could also use that in our flight lead upgrades or for our own training because all of our guys are transitioning to the F-35, so we have to keep them smart — or make them even smarter. Although it’s another aircraft, 90 percent of the skills you learn are also usable.' An RNLAF F-16AM accompanies an RNLAF F-35A. Frank Crébas A contractor-operated A-4K from Draken International, an RNLAF F-16AM, and an RNLAF F-35A. Frank Crébas So far, Vreeburg hasn’t flown an F-35, but he already knows what he thinks he might miss once he transitions to the fifth-generation fighter. 'In the F-16, under the canopy, you sit almost on top of the aircraft, you have almost restricted vision all around you. And it also flies a bit smoother, although that depends, right? If you have tanks, jamming pods, and weapons on your wings, then it flies totally differently than only with a centerline tank and a couple of missiles. In the F-35, almost everything is internal, most of the time, so it’s almost apples and oranges. But I’m hearing it’s not such smooth flying. The aerodynamics are different; the F-35 has a different wing shape, and you have the boundary layer that rumbles through the aircraft, which you don’t have on the F-16.' An F-16BM assigned to the U.S.-based RNLAF training unit rips through a valley at low level. Frank Crébas Frank Crébas Despite these differences, the basics of flying the jet will remain broadly similar, but the big change will come with mission employment, Vreeburg said. 'The tactics are different because the capabilities of the F-35 are different. With the F-16, you cannot employ the tactics that the F-35 can. We cannot fly as close to a ground-based threat as the F-35 can. Of course, we have to turn around when confronted by certain aircraft, because they will certainly see us and shoot at us. We might have to outmaneuver their missiles.' While evading modern air defense systems was becoming an increasing challenge for Dutch F-16 pilots, keeping the dwindling number of jets mission-ready proved to be less of a problem. 'There were enough spare parts,' Vreeburg said. 'But I think the biggest contributing factor was that a couple of years ago, we unified our separate maintenance squadrons. So that whole process from a broken jet or a jet needing maintenance to put it back on the flight line was now just one process, instead of broken up into separate ones. And of course, we also have a ton of experience in this squadron. We hand out a gold medal for 36 years of service as a non-commissioned officer. I think have handed out 50 or 60 in the last couple of years. There are lot of people with 30-plus years of F-16 experience.'

This jet was among those later transferred to Jordan. Frank Crébas Consistent upgrades, starting with the MLU program, have ensured that the F-16 remains relevant and able to meet the changing demands of air warfare and take on new missions as required. When Vreeburg started flying the Viper in the RNLAF’s U.S.-based training program, he was using the older Block 15OCU version, but by the time he was back in the Netherlands, he was getting acquainted with the MLU jet, in its initial M1 tape software iteration, followed soon after by the M2 tape. The RNLAF F-16s were successively upgraded to M6.5 tape, adding new capabilities all the time. 'I think one of the biggest changes was the incorporation of Link 16,' Vreeburg explained. 'It’s made it possible to fly other tactics. After that, each successive generation of targeting pod, which, of course, for our mainly close airport missions in Afghanistan, and later on in Iraq and Syria, was essential to provide support for troops on the ground. Later on, the incorporation of GPS-aided monitions like the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) and Small Diameter Bomb (SDB), then combined laser- and GPS-guided weapons, and the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS), of course.' Yesterday the Dutch JTAC community said their goodbyes to the RNLAF F-16 with one last CAS training mission. The oldest and youngest JTAC controlled 2 312 Vipers over Volkel. Targets destroyed.

Frank Crébas Three Dutch F-16s perform a break for the camera. Frank Crébas Right now, Vreeburg’s 312 Squadron has already converted its first pilots onto the F-35, and they are now flying with 313 Squadron, which has already converted to the F-35 at Volkel. 'The next pilots transitioning will also fly with 313 Squadron because if you look out of our window, they just started building our Special Access Program Facility [SAPF, used for classified intelligence and secure communications operations related to the F-35]. This whole building needs to be redone. The contractors will come in, strip everything down, redo it, finish it, and then we expect to be able to move back in here in 2027. By that time there should be enough trained pilots and maintainers to start operating with the first one or two flights.' Meanwhile, the first F-35s for 312 Squadron are very nearly ready. Vreeburg confirmed that there are 'a couple of F-35s' for the unit now being completed by Lockheed Martin. 'There were supposed to be done, but they are still waiting to be finished, and that will probably take a little while, but they are already 90 percent done.' Progressive modernization of the Dutch F-16 fleet means that the surviving aircraft are still more than capable in many combat scenarios, and they have been snapped up by Ukraine, which long sought to acquire jets of this type. RNLAF F-16AMs — carrying live AIM-120 AMRAAM and AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles — escort a U.S. Air Force B-52H over Europe. Frank Crébas 'The Netherlands government has promised 24 F-16s to the Ukrainian government,' Vreeburg explained. 'Our role in this is that we are the last squadron flying the F-16, so the F-16 expertise is in this squadron. We have a separate entity in our squadron, which is going to take care of the required maintenance and the handover to Ukraine. Although 312 Squadron is focused on the transition to the F-35, not everybody can start training at the same time. Maintainers also need to do training for the F-35 and as long as they are waiting to start that, they can help prepare the aircraft for Ukraine. And most of our aircraft are going to industry to get an overhaul, before being transferred to Ukraine. We still need to do some maintenance over here, before flying them to the industry. The only F-16 pilots that we still have are in this squadron or attached to it, so we have a small group of people who will keep flying the F-16 just to get them from Volkel to somewhere else.' Lt. Col. 'Naish' Vreeburg in the cockpit of an F-16AM. Frank Crébas Just 1 more week of RNLAF F-16 operations. Last week another week of fini flights and goodbyes. Even said goodbye to a couple of jets. Preparations for the final goodbye next week Friday are in full swing. Have a nice weekend. Sons of Bonzo! pic.twitter.com/dYcqDAZpND&mdash; Cdt 312 Squadron (@312Cdt) September 20, 2024 While his squadron and the wider RNLAF are very much now focused on the continued introduction of the F-35, Lt. Col. 'Naish' Vreeburg is still convinced that the F-16 has a lot more to offer once it arrives with the Ukrainian Air Force. 'The time has come to let the F-16 go, but I am convinced it can still be very valuable,' Vreeburg concluded. 'Let it go to new owners and a new purpose. Today will be a goodbye, but not the end. We need to clean up and finish up to make sure that the next user has good jets and effective jets to work with. We wish them a whole lot of luck doing that — to give them hell!'

Was A Mini 'Sword Bomb' Just Used To Strike A Car In Lebanon?	Imagery said to show the aftermath of a highly targeted air strike on a car in Lebanon has prompted questions about whether a previously unknown miniature munition designed to produce extremely little collateral damage may have been employed. Damage to the vehicle's windshield, in particular, has drawn broad comparisons to the telltale impact marks of the AGM-114R9X variant of the Hellfire missile, which has an array of pop-out blades rather than an explosive warhead. A video and several still pictures from the strike, which is said to have occurred in the Lebanese capital Beirut, began circulation on social media earlier today. The driver was wounded, but it is unclear what their condition might be now. Whether this individual, who does appear to have been identified as of yet, was the intended target of the strike and whether anyone else was in the car at the time is unknown. This all comes amid a major Israeli campaign targeting the terrorist group Hezbollah characterized so far by unprecedented attacks involving pagers and other electronics rigged to detonate on command, as well as days now of traditional airstrikes. There are now signs Israel may be preparing to invade southern Lebanon. Warning: some of the images below are very graphic.

The damage also looks to be consistent with a non-explosive kinetic munition designed to destroy its target through force of impact. A close-up look at the impact mark on the car's windshield. via X A deeper look at the interior of the car, including the sheered-off steering wheel. via X The cross-shaped impact mark left in the car's windshield is a primary factor that has prompted comparisons to the AGM-114R9X, a weapon The War Zone was first to report on the emergence of back in 2017. Also known by the nicknames 'ninja bomb' and 'the flying Ginsu,' the R9X version of the Hellfire has an array of sword-like blades (likely six) that are designed to pop out right before impact. You can read more about what is known about that missile, which was specifically designed to produce extremely little collateral damage during targeted strikes, here. What's claimed to be the remains of an R9X missile from a recent strike in Syria. This is by far the most complete examples I've seen.cc @FranticGoat Nick Waters (@N_Waters89) June 17, 2020 It is possible that Israel has developed a miniature aerial munition with four pop-out blades in the same general vein as the AGM-114R9X. At the same time, the potential 'blades' are arrayed around a well-defined circular center point. This is very different from what is typically seen after the employment of R9X Hellfires with their long blades explicitly designed to tear through whatever they hit. As such, there is also the possibility the 'blade' marks seen on the windshield of the car in Beirut could also be where the fins of a small munition passed through the windshield. Pictures of a car in Syria believed to have been struck by an AGM-114R9X in 2019 showing the kinds of impact marks associated with that weapon. via X Miniature air-launched munitions of various types, especially to arm equally small drones, are of growing interest globally. There are a number of known designs that feature arrays of stabilizing fins at the tail end or along the body, or both, which could conceivably leave similar impact marks on a car if employed in a non-explosive configuration. Northrop Grumman's Hatchet, the Shyrke from Corvid Technologies and L3Harris, Raytheon's Pyros Small Tactical Munition, and Textron's Fury are examples of such munitions that have been developed just in the United States in recent years. Foreign companies, like Roketsan in Turkey with its MAM family of munitions, are also in this growing market space. Another possibility might be that the munition that hit the car had an explosive warhead, but it did not detonate for some reason. At the same time, Israel does have an established history of employing aerial munitions with reduced explosive payloads or none at all. The U.S. military and others also employ similar kinds of low-collateral damage munitions, including inert bombs with warhead sections filled with concrete. The apparent precision of the strike on the car in Beirut also raises the question of how the munition might have been guided. The War Zone has pointed out in the past that the AGM-114R9X could require an operator-in-the-loop guidance system to be able to hit targets, such as a specific individual inside a moving vehicle, very precisely and to do so reliably. Israeli firms have been and continue to be pioneers in the development of operator-in-the-loop guidance capabilities. Advances in artificial intelligence-driven targeting capabilities could drastically help with this, as well. There is even the possibility that the R9X may have some degree of autonomous guidance that can recognize the selected aim point by itself. Much about the strike on the car in Beirut does remain unknown, but there are certainly signs that point to the employment of a new small and very low collateral damage munition. It would also make great sense to develop and deploy a smaller 'Ginsu-like' munition, especially for use with smaller drones, and for carrying out even more exacting strikes. While what we know about the strike in Beirut does not conclusively prove that such a munition now exists, it may just be a matter of time.

China’s New Nuclear Submarine Sank During Mysterious Incident In ...	The mysterious incident that TWZ previously reported that occurred at China’s Wuchang Shipyard in the spring of this year resulted in the sinking of the country’s latest nuclear-powered attack submarine, according to U.S. officials. The boat in question, originally identified as a conventionally powered submarine, was the first of the new Type 041 Zhou class SSNs. Citing unnamed U.S. officials, a report in The Wall Street Journal today describes an attempt by the Chinese authorities to cover up the accident, involving a submarine 'likely' carrying nuclear fuel when it sank. The boat had been undergoing its final fitting out before going to sea. 'American officials haven’t detected any indication that Chinese officials have sampled the water or nearby environment for radiation,' the article continues. 'It is possible Chinese personnel were killed or injured when the sub sank, but U.S. officials say they don’t know if there were casualties.' Well&#8230;there it is. DoD confirms:- a new-construction PRC submarine sank at the pier in Wuhan- the boat was first of a new class, the Type 041 Zhou- PRC authorities scrambled to cover it upAND- DoD reveals that it is nuclear-powered Tom Shugart (@tshugart3) September 26, 2024 There had already been signs that something was amiss at Wuchang Shipyard, part of the state-owned China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC), located on the Yangtze River just outside the city of Wuhan. The unusual activity at the Wuchang Shipyard was first observed by Tom Shugart, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) think tank and a retired U.S. Navy submarine warfare officer. TWZ previously examined satellite imagery showing the sudden appearance of four crane barges at the shipyard in China, these being in place at least from June 12 through June 17. A submarine that had been in the berth in May was absent during those dates, but it was not clear when exactly it was last seen. By the first week of July, the barges were gone and activity at Wuchang appears to have returned to normal. A satellite image taken on June 15, 2024, showing a cluster of four crane barges and other unusual activity at Wuchang Shipyard. PHOTOS © 2024 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION The U.S. officials didn’t provide details of the alleged accident, beyond the fact that it involved one of the new Zhou class SSNs, a design that features a distinctive X-shaped stern. This feature is designed for improved maneuverability, efficiency, and safety, and also helps reduce the acoustic signature across significant parts of the submarine’s operating envelope, as you can read about here. Using those four cranes, the submarine is said to have been salvaged, but the WSJ report suggests it will 'likely take many months before it can be put to sea' — presuming that is even possible. If the submarine fully sank, its internal spaces would likely have filled with water, requiring the replacement of all the electronics. Another view of the Wuchang Shipyard on May 29, showing a submarine moored in the same general location where the crane barges appeared some two weeks later. PHOTOS © 2024 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION 'It’s not surprising that the PLA Navy would try to conceal the fact that their new first-in-class nuclear-powered attack submarine sank pier-side,' a senior U.S. defense official told the WSJ. 'In addition to the obvious questions about training standards and equipment quality, the incident raises deeper questions about the PLA’s internal accountability and oversight of China’s defense industry, which has long been plagued by corruption.' Confirmation from U.S. sources of an accident at one of China’s most important shipyards, and in particular one that constructs new submarines, is certainly significant. As the above U.S. defense official alludes to, there have been questions raised in the past about safety and quality control practices in Chinese naval shipbuilding, which is often observed progressing very rapidly, even when it comes to large and/or complex vessels. A satellite image taken in September 2022 provides a general view of the Wuchang Shipyard outside of Wuhan, China. Google Earth Despite — or because of — these shortcomings, China has demonstrated it’s exponentially more capable of building submarines and other warships than the United States, as you can read more about here. Now the comparative quality of those vessels remains debatable. With that in mind, the sinking of a new SSN is a setback, but not one that is likely to hugely change the pace of the country’s submarine-building program, which, in contrast to the U.S. equivalent, involved nuclear-powered and conventionally powered designs. The fact that a new SSN is being built at the Wuchang Shipyard is significant in itself. A stock picture of a Type 039A or Yuan class submarine. via U.S. Navy In the past, the Wuchang Shipyard has been predominantly associated with the construction of variants of the Type 039A series boats, also known in the West as the Yuan class. The shipyard also builds various types of surface warships and supports other naval developmental work, including past testing of an electromagnetic railgun. It produces commercial vessels and now it can also add nuclear-powered submarines to the list. It's very unlikely that Chinese authorities will reveal any details of what happened with the submarine during the incident earlier this year. And while it probably will have little impact on the rapidly growing People’s Liberation Army, its disclosure by U.S. officials does reveal some interesting aspects of the country’s increasingly diverse submarine-building efforts.

Final KC-10 Extender Tanker Flies Into Retirement	The U.S. Air Force officially said farewell today to the KC-10 Extender, sending its final example to the boneyard, while recognizing the service that the stalwart tanker and cargo aircraft provided since it first entered service in 1981. As you can read about here, the KC-10 inventory has been rapidly reduced over the last couple of years, although it’s not yet entirely clear what the service’s future tanker fleet will consist of. Today is a bittersweet day as we bid farewell to the last KC-10A Extender heading to the boneyard. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE, Big Sexy. Share your favorite memories below and tag the friends, colleagues, or family members you've made memories with the #Gucci crew. pic.twitter.com/3mdgHpAkKO&mdash; Travis AFB Official (@Travis60AMW) September 26, 2024 The KC-10 farewell ceremony took place in Hangar 46 at Travis Air Force Base, California, home of the final Air Force wing to operate the type. After official speeches, the last KC-10, callsign GUCCI 10, made the flight from Travis to the boneyard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona. The aircraft made some low passes over Travis before heading to Long Beach, passing over the place it was built. They sent her with some friends so she wouldn’t be lonely… pic.twitter.com/FSgvk8IeF5&mdash; KC-10 Driver B-737 Wrangler (@MCCCANM) September 26, 2024 The first KC-10 for Travis arrived at the base in 1994 and the type was most recently operated by the 6th and 9th Air Refueling Squadrons supported by the 660th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron. So long, old friend! Fair skies & tailwinds – enjoy your hard earned retirement!I’ll come see you in a museum someday & we’ll reminisce on old times. I’ll bring the patch, too. pic.twitter.com/kmXT5db9LR&mdash; KC-10 Driver B-737 Wrangler (@MCCCANM) September 26, 2024 Unofficially nicknamed 'Gucci' or 'Big Sexy,' the KC-10 was based on the DC-10-30CF and retained 88 percent of systems commonality with the commercial trijet. The Air Force acquired the KC-10 as a ‘heavy tanker’ to supplement the KC-135 Stratotanker family, with a DC-10-derived design chosen since it could be brought into service quickly to provide urgently needed additional tanker capacity. A primary mission was refueling large, fully laden transports flying over long distances, something that would become arguably even more important in the decades to follow. The KC-10 was especially well suited to this mission. With the three main DC-10 wing fuel tanks supplemented by three large fuel tanks under the cargo floor, it accommodated almost twice as much aviation fuel as the KC-135 — more than 356,000 pounds. Unlike almost all the KC-135R fleet, the KC-10 was also fitted with its own refueling receptacle, meaning it could take on gas from a KC-135 or another KC-10 to increase its delivery range. Another interesting feature was the KC-10’s ability to pump fuel in reverse, sending it back up the boom from another aircraft.

Mark C. Olsen Mark Olsen Other advantages over the Stratotanker included the KC-10’s integrated hose-and-drogue system, allowing it to refuel U.S. Navy and Marine Corps aircraft, as well as probe-equipped receivers flown by other operators, without any further modifications. Twenty KC-10s did, however, receive wing-mounted pods, allowing multiple probe-equipped receivers to top up simultaneously. The KC-10 was also a load-carrying specialist. In its important secondary cargo-carrying mission, the Extender could transport nearly 170,000 pounds of cargo and up to 75 passengers over a distance of around 4,400 miles. The ability to lift cargo and simultaneously refuel other aircraft made the KC-10 ideal for supporting transoceanic deployments of fighters, for example, with support personnel and equipment being carried to the destination while the accompanying jets topped up en route.

G. Woodford (@PWoodford) September 26, 2024 The Air Force bought 60 KC-10As — only one variant of the type was ever fielded — although one was later lost in an explosion and subsequent fire while undergoing maintenance at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana in 1987. The Netherlands also received two similar KDC-10 aircraft, now operated by Omega Air, a pioneer in the commercial aerial refueling segment. An Omega KDC‐10 tanker refuels a U.S. Air Force F‐16C from the 51st Fighter Wing, en route to Paya Lebar Air Base, Singapore, on November 6, 2023. U.S. Air Force The hard-worked KC-10 fleet was beginning to show its age by 2018 when smoke on the flight deck of one of the aircraft forced the crew to evacuate. A separate fault quickly revealed itself in the same incident, when the crew’s escape slides failed to activate. The problem was found to affect the entire fleet. At the same time, with DC-10s and MD-11s having left airline service and now also disappearing from cargo operators, the KC-10 was also becoming harder to support. Soon enough, the Air Force was looking for ways to retire the KC-10. Despite some resistance, including from within the military, Congress ultimately approved the divestiture. In July 2020, the retirement of the U.S. Air Force KC-10 fleet began, when the first example arrived at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. As of September 2023, 37 KC-10s were in the boneyard, including 12 that had gone there in that same year. The U.S. Air Force KC-10 completed its final combat deployment on October 5 last year, when the last example departed Prince Sultan Air Base (PSAB) in Saudi Arabia. The KC-10’s career included more than 30 years spent within the U.S. Air Forces Central (AFCENT) area of responsibility, supporting military operations, including Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom.

Alexander Frank Although the KC-10 has now bowed out, the Air Force is still weighing up options for its future tanker fleet. The immediate replacement for the KC-10 is the KC-46 Pegasus, an aircraft that has had no shortage of problems in its development, many of which persist now that it’s in service. A KC-46, lower right, conducting refueling receiver tests behind a KC-10 Extender with a KC-135 Stratotanker in the background waiting its turn as refueler. U.S. Air Force U.S. Air Force Photo by Christopher Okula Previously, there were plans to field a KC-10 successor under the KC-Y program, the counterpart to the KC-X, which was to replace the KC-135 (and for which the KC-46 was eventually selected). The question now is what happens after the Air Force receives the last of its 179 KC-46s, which is due to happen in 2029. As soon as the KC-46s are delivered, the service wants to start inducting 75 more aerial refuelers, aircraft that it had previously referred to as 'bridge tankers.' The bridge tankers — which could be more KC-46s, Lockheed Martin’s LMXT, or even based also contractor-based leased solutions — are viewed as an interim solution until the Air Force gets the tanker that it really wants, and one that will very likely feature survivability as a core element of its design. This may well result in a design that stresses low-observable features, as we have discussed before. A concept of a future low-observavle tanker from the Lockheed Martin Skunk Works. Lockheed Martin By the time a tanker of that kind is in service, the Cold War-era KC-10 will look even more dated. That said, the aircraft is still providing useful service in its contractor-operated form. It would not be entirely surprising if at least some of the former U.S. Air Force KC-10s end up in the hands of private companies, like the former Dutch KDC-10s with Omega. Were that to happen, the KC-10’s career refueling U.S. military aircraft might not be over.

Third Marine XQ-58 Valkyrie Flight Test Uses Link 16 For Control	The U.S. Marine Corps says it has demonstrated new capabilities for operating future drones with high degrees of autonomy in expeditionary operations with another test flight of one of its stealthy XQ-58 Valkyries. Newly added capabilities leveraging the popular Link 16 network were central to the test. The Marines have now conducted three XQ-58 flight tests as the service continues to explore how it might use these or other drones in various roles, including as uncrewed electronic warfare aircraft, surveillance and reconnaissance platforms, airborne communications relay, or wingmen for crewed fighters like the F-35. The latest Marine XQ-58 test flight was conducted from the U.S. Air Force's Eglin Air Force Base in Florida on September 20, but was only announced publicly today. The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, the U.S. Navy's Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) of Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), and unnamed industry partners supported the test. Eglin is a major test and training hub and is also home to Air Force XQ-58s. The Air Force, which carried out the Valkyrie's first flight back in 2019, is the only other known operator of the type to date. A US Marine Corps XQ-58 flies together with a pair of US Air Force F-35A Joint Strike Fighters during a previous test out of Eglin Air Force Base in 2023. USAF Kratos included a version of this picture, taken during a test flight out of Eglin Air Force Base on February 23, 2024, in its press release yesterday that mentioned the MQ-58B. USAF The new Marine XQ-58 test 'demonstrated newly added Link-16 capabilities for the uncrewed collaborative combat aircraft prototype, marking the first time the Department of Defense controlled an air vehicle using offboard expeditionary methods,' according to an official release. No further details were provided about the 'offboard expeditionary methods' employed during the flight. 'Initial results indicate that the prototype met threshold requirements for autonomously exchanging relevant tactical information,' the Marine release adds. 'These Link-16 capabilities significantly enhance the Marine Air-Ground Task Force’s ability to conduct integrated and joint operations, contributing to the Marine Corps' mission to deter conflict and, when necessary, defeat enemies in complex and evolving scenarios.' Another look at a Marine XQ-58 during a previous flight test. USAF An XQ-58A seen during the type's first flight in Marine Corps service in October 2023. USAF Link 16 is one of the most common communications waveforms utilized in the U.S. military today. The network has been used in various past drone testing, including ones involving the control of uncrewed aircraft from remote locations. Work is underway now to extend the Link 16 network into space, which will offer significant advantages in breadth and persistence of coverage, as you can read more about here. As such, using Link 16 to demonstrate new ways to control and otherwise exchange information with drones like the XQ-58 makes good sense. The Marine Corps' use of Link 16 via 'offboard expeditionary' capabilities also aligns fully with the service's desire to be able to use future uncrewed aircraft like this to support forces at and even potentially operate from far-flung forward locations with limited infrastructure. The Marines are now further looking to demonstrate how uncrewed aircraft might fit into those future operations next month. 'This successful test [on September 20] was conducted in preparation for Emerald Flag 2024, a multiservice and multi-domain training exercise scheduled for October,' according to the Marines. 'The exercise will incorporate technology and focus on the efficiency of joint warfare. The XQ-58A has proven itself ready for this capstone event, allowing the Marine Corps to demonstrate cooperative kill chain closure between manned and unmanned strike platforms for the first time in a large-force exercise.' The War Zone has highlighted in the past how the baseline version of the XQ-58, specifically, which takes off and lands without any need for a runway at all, would be ideally suited to the Corps' vision for future expeditionary and distributed operations. Kratos, maker of the Valkyrie, has also demonstrated a specialized launch trolley that allows the drones to take off from traditional runways, and do so with more fuel and/or larger payloads. The company is now in the process of crafting a version with built-in landing gear. The addition of a Link 16 capability on the Marine XQ-58 also highlights the drone's ability to serve as a valuable communications relay node. Previous Air Force testing has already involved Valkyries carrying software-defined communications packages capable of 'talking' to stealthy datalinks like the Intra-Flight Data Link (IFDL) on the F-22 Raptor and the Multifunctional Advanced Data Link (MADL) found on all three variants of the F-35. MADL could also be a feature on the forthcoming B-21 Raider stealth bomber. F-35s also have Link16 capability, but transmitting via the omnidirectional datalinks used with that waveform makes it easier for hostile forces to detect and track the otherwise stealthy jets. Those datalinks are also more susceptible to jamming than low probability of intercept/low probability of detection (LPI/LPD) types like MADL and IFDL. It's also worth noting that MADL and IFDL cannot communicate directly with each other. This only further underscores the importance of gateway nodes that can translate between various waveforms in future operations, which could also involve allies and partners using their own networks.

USAF A US Air Force XQ-58A, at bottom left, flies together with an F-35A, in the middle, and an F-22 Raptor stealth fighter at top right, during a test. USAF The Marine Corps' XQ-58 flight test last week also speaks to broader questions that the entire U.S. military is working to answer about how to control and otherwise manage an increasingly large number of uncrewed platforms, as well as how much autonomy they can and should have going forward. The Marines are currently part of a tri-service agreement with the U.S. Navy and the Air Force regarding the development of future Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones, which focuses heavily on common control and communications architectures. While the exact roles and missions CCAs will be able to perform, and how they will be deployed and employed operationally, have already been evolving, there is a broad consensus that they will operate very closely together with crewed aircraft, at least initially. 'As we go forward, I expect there’ll be a strike aspect to CCAs, as well, but initially we’re focused on air superiority and how to use the CCAs in conjunction with a crewed aircraft to achieve air superiority,' Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall told The War Zone and other outlets at a media roundtable on the sidelines of the Air & Space Forces Association's (AFA) main annual conference last week. 'When we do the ops analysis, there’s a really clear advantage of that.' 'One of the things you have to have if you’re going to use CCAs and have them be armed and … Lethal is that they have to be under tight control. And, for me, one of the elements of that needs to be line-of-sight communications. And I think that that’s an important thing to have in the mix, secure, reliable line-of-sight communications. We’re not going to have aircraft going out and doing engagements uncontrolled,' Kendall added. 'So the default, if they lose communications, would be for them to return to base, which takes them out of the fight. So we don’t want that to happen. And when they do do engagements, … we want them under tight control. So I think the mix of crewed and uncrewed aircraft, I think, is going to be the right answer for the foreseeable future.' 'We know two things about autonomy,' Andrew Hunter, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology & Logistics, said at a separate roundtable at the recent AFA conference. 'One is laws of war require us to have, you know, human engagement in key decisions involving employment of weapons and other key decisions. So we have to have that. We have to have that human engagement, the ability to do that. The second is [that] we know that our ability to create systems that can operate autonomously and do missions well is something that is still maturing.' 'So, in other words, there are things that we know that we already know how to do well with autonomy, and there’s things that we know we do not know how to do well with autonomy,' Hunter continued. 'So we’re going to stick to the things we know we can do well, and then have humans do the other things, and, over time, that mix is going to change… it’s not going to be static.' With all this in mind, the Marine Corps' latest XQ-58 flight test looks to be a significant step forward for that service's future uncrewed aviation plans, as well as one that could be important in informing CCA and other future drone developments across the U.S. military.

Biden Surging $8B In Aid To Ukraine That Includes AGM-154 Joint S...	Hours before he was scheduled to meet with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky, U.S. President Joe Biden announced nearly $8 billion in additional military aid for Kyiv. The move will provide Ukraine with long-range strike weapons, air defenses, and additional F-16 training for pilots, among other items. 'For nearly three years, the United States has rallied the world to stand with the people of Ukraine as they defend their freedom from Russian aggression, and it has been a top priority of my administration to provide Ukraine with the support it needs to prevail,' Biden said in a statement early Thursday morning. 'In that time, Ukraine has won the battle of Kyiv, reclaimed more than half the territory that Russia seized at the start of the war, and safeguarded its sovereignty and independence. But there is more work to do. That is why, today, I am announcing a surge in security assistance for Ukraine and a series of additional actions to help Ukraine win this war.' The new aid comes from two pools of funding. Most of it - $5.5 billion - is from Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) funding. That program sends military equipment to Ukraine from existing U.S. stocks and pays for its replenishment. By issuing his directive to the Pentagon, Biden assures that the Congressionally authorized PDA funds to not expire on Sept. 30 with the end of the current fiscal year. The second pool of funds - $2.4 billion - is from the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) and provides money to Ukraine to procure listed items directly from manufacturers. The USAI funds 'will provide Ukraine with additional air defense, Unmanned Aerial Systems, and air-to-ground munitions, as well as strengthen Ukraine’s defense industrial base and support its maintenance and sustainment requirements,' Biden stated. 'To enhance Ukraine’s long-range strike capabilities, I have decided to provide Ukraine with' AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) glide munitions,' Biden announced. The unpowered air-to-ground weapon will be used by Ukraine’s donated F-16s. They have a range of over 70 miles, depending on flight profile, so it can be launched from outside the range of many enemy’s air defense systems. You can read what this weapon will bring in terms of capabilities to Ukraine in our previous report here. U.S. President Joe Biden has decided to provide Ukraine with AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapons (JSOW) (Ioannis Lekkas ) Back in a June of 2023, we published a large feature about the potential weapons that would equip Ukraine's F-16s. In that piece we posited JSOW would be the most likely standoff strike option to be transferred for a number of reasons. Biden also directed the Pentagon to 'refurbish and provide Ukraine with an additional Patriot air defense battery and to provide Ukraine with additional Patriot missiles.' The U.S. has so far provided Ukraine with two such systems. President Joe Biden has ordered the Pentagon to provide Ukraine with an additional Patriot air defense system battery. (DoD) In addition, Biden ordered the Pentagon to 'expand training for Ukrainian F-16 pilots, including by supporting the training of an additional 18 pilots next year.' Ukraine had only around half a dozen pilots trained to fly the F-16 when the first jets were delivered this summer, and one has been killed. The lack of pilots and robust training to support a fleet that could end up being nearly 100 jets has been a major concern of Kyiv's. Beyond military aid, Biden announced that the Department of Justice, the Department of the Treasury, and the U.S. Secret Service 'have taken action today to disrupt a global cryptocurrency network, in coordination with international partners.' That move is designed to 'counter Russian sanctions evasion and money laundering, The United States will continue to raise the costs on Russia for its war in Ukraine and to deprive the Russian defense industrial base of resources.' Biden did not specify what systems will be provided to Ukraine under the additional PDA funding. However, on Wednesday, the Pentagon announced a new $375 million package - the 66th PDA - that included the first donation of JSOWs. That PDA package also included: Ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS); 155mm and 105mm artillery ammunition; Tube-launched, Optically tracked, Wire-guided (TOW) missiles; Javelin and AT-4 anti-armor systems; M1117 Armored Security Vehicles; Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Vehicles; Light tactical vehicles; Armored bridging systems; Small arms; Patrol boats; Demolitions equipment and munitions; Spare parts, ancillary equipment, services, training, and transportation.

(Photo by Aimee Dilger/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) The new aid funding announcement comes as Zelensky visited the U.S. to drum up support for his as-yet-undisclosed 'victory plan.' It is said to include long-term guarantees for security assistance as well as requests for more long-range weapons and the ability to use them deep inside Russia, something Biden so far has refused to do, fearing a backlash from Russian President Vladimir Putin and concerns about maintaining U.S. supplies. While Zelensky has yet to publicly disclose his victory plan, it is being met with skepticism by the Biden administration, The Wall Street Journal reported. The plan 'lacks a comprehensive strategy and is little more than a repackaged request for more weapons and the lifting of restrictions on long-range missiles,' the publication reported, citing U.S. officials. The Biden administration is concerned that the Ukrainian leader’s plan for winning the war against Russia lacks a comprehensive strategy, U.S. officials said The Wall Street Journal (@WSJ) September 25, 2024 During his trip to Washington, Zelensky will also meet with Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, to discuss his plan. A meeting with Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump seems to be off the table at the moment. Trump and fellow Republicans have taken to chastizing Zelensky, with many calling for him to fire Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova over his visit last week to an ammunition plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania because no Republicans were involved.

Before he arrived, most of the money for the new aid was still caught up in the uncertainties of the U.S. political process. Biden was forced to announce the new package after Congress failed to include a request from the administration to extend the Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) for Ukraine in the stopgap funding bill that passed on Wednesday night, The Hill reported. 'The failure of Congress to extend the PDA is one symptom of Washington’s dysfunction and increased Republican opposition over allocating aid for Ukraine,' the publication explained. Even with the new aid, Ukraine faces an increasingly difficult fight from Russia, especially in the east, where several towns are in danger of falling. It continues to advance incrementally in Russia's Kursk region, but how much longer Zelensky can staff and equip both fronts remains to be seen. Ukraine should get new equipment and weapons from existing U.S. stocks soon but it will be years before they can procure weapons from manufacturers. The dynamics on the battlefield could be radically different the next time Zelensky visits the U.S. Contact the author: howard@thewarzone.com	https://www.twz.com/news-features/biden-surging-8b-in-aid-to-ukraine-that-includes-agm-154-joint-standoff-weapons-for-f-16s	2024-09-26T10:02:12-07:00	https://www.twz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/JSOW-F16.jpg?quality=85
Israel’s Potential Invasion Of Southern Lebanon Looms Larger	In the wake of Hezbollah’s first ballistic missile attack on Israel, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have been told to prepare to fight in Lebanon. That statement, from the Chief of Staff of the Israeli Defense Forces, is the strongest indication so far that an invasion of the north is fast approaching. 'You hear the jets overhead; we have been striking all day. This is both to prepare the ground for your possible entry and to continue degrading Hezbollah,' Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said in a message to his troops on Wednesday. 'Today, Hezbollah expanded its range of fire, and later today, they will receive a very strong response. Prepare yourselves.'

The goal is very… pic.twitter.com/oQi00DOhZS&mdash; Joe Truzman (@JoeTruzman) September 25, 2024 Halevi told the troops they would be needed to create a buffer zone to help foster the return of tens of thousands of Israelis who have fled their homes in northern Israel as a result of Hezbollah missile, rocket and drone attacks. 'To achieve that, we are preparing the process of a maneuver, which means your military boots, your maneuvering boots, will enter enemy territory, enter villages that Hezbollah has prepared as large military outposts, with underground infrastructure, staging points, and launchpads into our territory and carry out attacks on Israeli civilians.' THIS is how close Hezbollah’s weapons are located to communities in Israel.Each picture shows different civilian houses in southern Lebanon that had weapons ready to be used to kill Israelis.We are operating in this area in order to eliminate the presence of terrorist… pic.twitter.com/M0ACnPMYLW&mdash; Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) September 25, 2024 Israeli troops, he vowed, are more than up to the challenge. The IDF has called up two reserve brigades to bolster its forces in the north, according to PBS. 'Your entry into those areas with force, your encounter with Hezbollah operatives, will show them what it means to face a professional, highly skilled, and battle-experienced force,' he added. 'You are coming in much stronger and far more experienced than they are. You will go in, destroy the enemy there, and decisively destroy their infrastructure. These are the things that will allow us to safely return the residents of the north afterward.' A ground operation into southern Lebanon appears aimed at creating a buffer zone to keep Hezbollah from using its massive quantities of short-range rockets, as well as anti-tank missiles, small drones, and sniper fire to make life near the border and in northern Israel in general very challenging. While the goal may be to protect the north, Hezbollah also has an arsenal of missiles and drones that can strike into Israel from a significant distance. So such an operation could severely degrade Hezbollah's ability to strike into Israel, but it alone would not come close to eliminating it entirely. Hezbollah's long-range capabilities were driven home when the militant group fired what it called a Qader-1 ballistic missile at Mossad headquarters near Tel Aviv yesterday. Hezbollah 'confirmed that the targeted headquarters is responsible for assassinating the leaders and blowing up the pagers and wireless devices,' the group’s Al Mayadeen news outlet reported on Telegram.

Little is known about the Qader-1. The official Iranian Mehr news agency described it as 'a long-range missile' using a combination of solid and liquid fuel, with a range of up to 1,950 km (about 1,200 miles) and a warhead weighing between 700 and 1,000 kilograms (about 1,540 to 2,200 pounds.' As we noted in our deep dive into Hezbollah's massive arsenal of missiles and rockets, the Lebanese militant group's weapons development and stockpile is primarily provided by Iran. One expert on Iranian and Hezbollah weapons told The War Zone that it could be from the Fateh family of weapons. The Qader-1 could be 'a single-stage, short-range ballistic missile, probably a copy of the Fateh system,' Benham Ben Taleblu, a senior research fellow with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank in Washington D.C., told The War Zone Wednesday. It could be a Fateh-110, he surmised. Or it could be 'the domestic upgrade that turns rockets into missiles with guidance systems and controllable fins.' After we interviewed Taleblu, Hezbollah released images it claims were the Qader-1. After The War Zone shared them with Taleblu, he said that confirmed his earlier suspicions about it being some version of a Fateh-110.

That is certainly far enough to strike Tel Aviv, about 70 miles south of the border. The Fateh-110 can carry a high explosive warhead weighing around 1,000 pounds and has become increasingly accurate in later variants and derivatives, with GPS-assisted guidance added. The use of Fateh-110s and Zolfaghar (also written Zulfiqar) derivatives to target a U.S. military base at Erbil, in Iraq, in March 2022, as well as on other targets in Syria, suggests that current variants are much more accurate, offering true precision strike capabilities. It remains unclear if Hezbollah has the latest versions and/or in what quantities.

'This is the first launch by Hezbollah of a ballistic missile at Israel,' he stated. That Hezbollah launched just one ballistic missile may be a message to Israel that the campaign described by Halevi to degrade Hezbollah ahead of a looming Israeli incursion did not work, an Al Jazeera correspondent posited. 'It’s only one missile, so it’s more than likely to be a message from Hezbollah that they still have ballistic missile capability,' Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan said.

The Biden administration 'is working on a new diplomatic initiative for a ‘pause’ in the fighting in Lebanon and a resumption of negotiations on a Gaza hostage and ceasefire deal,' Axios reported, citing two U.S. officials, one Israeli official and two sources with direct knowledge. 'The aim is to achieve a pause that will give space for negotiations on a broader diplomatic deal to prevent a wider war, allow displaced civilians to return to their homes on both sides of the border, and provide renewed momentum for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal.'

My story on @axios Barak Ravid (@BarakRavid) September 25, 2024 Asked whether his country would join Hezbollah in a fight against Isreal, Iran's Vice President Javad Zarif told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that both Iran and Hezbollah 'have exercised restraint' so far. 'Iran has exercised restraint when Israel took conducted military operations against Iran, conducted terrorist operations killing the leader of Hamas who was attending the inauguration of our president, of all things, and we exercised restraint,' Zarif said. 'We believe that Hezbollah is capable of defending itself. It has been exercising restraint enough to doing so, it is the responsibility of the international community to come in before Hezbollah has to take its defense into its own hands and maybe, the situation will get out hand.'

First Chinese ICBM Test Into The Pacific In Decades Is A Big Deal	For the first time in more than four decades, China has fired an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) out in the Western Pacific, ostensibly for training purposes. As an individual act, this sends immediate signals, especially to the United States and its allies. There are also signs that the launch could be the start of more regular open-ocean tests as China continues to dramatically expand its nuclear stockpile and ICBM arsenal. Transporter-erector-launchers for China's DF-41, one of a number of ICBM types the country currently has in service, on parade. GREG BAKER/AFP via Getty Images The Chinese Ministry of National Defense announced the ICBM launch earlier today (it is now Thursday, September 26, in China), but provided only limited details and did not identify the specific type of missile that was fired. The Ministry did stress that the missile was not loaded with live warheads. The last time China sent an ICBM of any kind flying out into the Pacific, at least that we know of, was in 1980. Chinese ICBM launches since then have been targeted at inland ranges in the Western end of the country. Chinese forces have fired shorter-range ballistic missiles into bodies of water within the broader Western Pacific region, including the South China Sea, in the intervening years. Publicly available warning notices show that the missile was launched from China's Hainan Island at the northern end of the South China Sea and indicate it was aimed at a patch of the Pacific just outside of France's Exclusive Economic Zone around French Polynesia. The distance between the launch and impact points is roughly 7,145 miles (11,500 kilometers). 1/x#China announced that they test-fired an #ICBM into the central #Pacific this morning (25 Sep) at 00:44 UTC.From Navigational Warnings and NOTAM's, it was fired from Hainan with a ~11 700 km range and RV impact near 10.4 S, 146.5 W.@nukestrat @planet4589 @wslafoy @nktpnd pic.twitter.com/WnhcxNiLxQ&mdash; Dr Marco Langbroek (@Marco_Langbroek) September 25, 2024 4/xApproximate 3D flightpath (exact launch site on Hainan is unknown for now) pic.twitter.com/dmTkrJSmgQ&mdash; Dr Marco Langbroek (@Marco_Langbroek) September 25, 2024 It is unclear if @francediplo and @presidencepf were contacted in advance (beyond the NOTAM). The landing zone of the Chinese's reentry vehicle is right next to the French Polynesian EEZ. This is clearly problematic and possibly part of China's signaling. pic.twitter.com/1jC7VVqj0I&mdash; Sébastien Philippe (@seb6philippe) September 25, 2024 Launching from Hainan points to the missile that was fired being a road-mobile ICBM, such as a DF-31 or DF-41, rather than a silo-based one. China has been massively expanding its silo infrastructure in recent years, but all of the known fields are deep within the mainland. It is also worth noting that China also has silo-based versions of the DF-31 and that there have long been discussions about the likely possibility of a variant of the DF-41 variant that can be launched in this way, as well. China's last known open-ocean ICBM launch was of an older silo-based DF-5. The ICBM test shows a range of 11,500 km. Applying the same range from the new missile silo field in Ordos, China, we can see that the entire United States in within the range of this ICBM should it be deployed in the new silos. pic.twitter.com/Kksu5WqTEd&mdash; Sébastien Philippe (@seb6philippe) September 25, 2024 Satellite imagery the Pentagon has previously released of work on a new silo in a field in northwestern China. DOD Satellite imagery included in the Pentagon's last annual China report showing what appears to be the completion of work, at least externally, on a new ICBM silo in a field in northwestern China. DOD Experts and observers have pointed out that there is real practical training and testing value to China's new Pacific ICBM launch. This includes just being able to go through the full motions of firing such a missile out to its intended range along a typical flight profile. When launched at targets on inland ranges, Chinese ICBMs are fired at very high trajectories to account for the relatively limited space available. A live-fire launch from Hainan would also offer Chinese personnel a valuable opportunity to practice deploying a road-mobile launcher to a forward site and actually employing it once there. Other nuclear powers, including the United States, routinely launch nuclear-capable ballistic missiles out into the Pacific, as well as the Atlantic, for training and testing purposes, as well as to demonstrate general deterrent capacity and otherwise send signals. That means, if the PLARF wanted to test a depressed trajectory, they're going to need to find another place to test their ICBMs - like the pacific ocean.&mdash; Decker Eveleth (@dex_eve) September 25, 2024 Especially considering the ICBM they launched is almost certainly launched from a mobile launcher. By doing it out at Hainan and launching from a potentially unfamiliar launch location the missile crew may be unfamiliar with you can identify potential pitfalls in the process.&mdash; Decker Eveleth (@dex_eve) September 25, 2024 At the same time, the first Chinese open-ocean ICBM launch into the Pacific in decades sends clear signals to countries across the region and beyond. Chinese authorities expressly notified their counterparts in the United States, Australia and New Zealand, all three of which are allies, about the impending launch, according to Japan's Kyodo News. Unsurprisingly, a U.S. Air Force RC-135S Cobra Ball, an aircraft specifically configured to gather intellignce about missile launches, looks to have been in the air in the Western Pacific at the time based on online flight tracking data. The over-water launch would have given the U.S. government and others a rare opportunity to glean new insights into current Chinese ICBM capabilities.

As already noted, the impact point appears to have been close to the territory of another American ally, France, which has also been looking to expand its military presence in the Pacific. The missile's path looks to have snaked between Taiwan and the Philippines – also both major American partners in the region – based on the warning notices, as well.

'We also need to uphold our principles as we seek to responsibly manage the competition with China so it does not veer into conflict,' Biden said. 'We stand ready to cooperate on urgent challenges for the good of our people and the people everywhere.' The launch also follows years now of the U.S. government drawing attention to the Chinese military's significantly expanding nuclear and missile arsenals, including the aforementioned silo build-up, and calling for greater transparency about these developments. China's nuclear stockpile more than doubled in size just between 2020 and 2023, according to the Pentagon. These Chinese have an estimated 500 warheads, in total, now, and that figure is expected to grow to around 1,000 by 2030 and 1,500 by 2035, according to U.S. government asessments. In August, The New York Times reported that U.S. nuclear deterrent strategy had become primarily focused around China for the first time ever. The Times' story cited a classified document that the outlet said further warned about 'possible coordinated nuclear challenges from China, Russia and North Korea.' China's ties with Russia, including in the realm of military cooperation, have grown substantially in recent years, especially since 2022 with the Kremlin's increasing global isolation as a result of the ongoing war in Ukraine. Russia and Chinese warships in the Tsugaru Strait between the Japanese home islands of Honshu and Hokkaido during a naval exercise in 2021. Photo by Sun Zifa/China News Service via Getty Images American officials have also been pushing to get their Chinese counterparts to the table to negotiate possible new strategic arms control agreements, so far without any real success. Geopolitical friction exists between China and the United States, as well as many other countries in the Pacific region and beyond, over a host of issues, including the status of the island of Taiwan. Beijing's expansive and largely unrecognized territorial claims, especially in the South China Sea, also present particularly significant risks for flashpoint moments that could easily turn into larger conflicts, as has been seen in recent months around the Philippines. The new Chinese open-ocean ICBM launch could also be intended to send signals domestically. The People's Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) was reportedly at the center of a number of corruption scandals that prompted major leadership shakeups in 2023, as you can read more about here. The PLARF oversees the country’s arsenal of nuclear and conventionally-armed ground-based ballistic, cruise, and hypersonic missiles, as well as various supporting elements. Beyond any immediate messaging, these are signs that the ICBM launch from Hainan reflects bigger changes in Chinese policy coming down the line. The Chinese Ministry of Defense described firing the missile out into the Pacific as a 'routine' part of an 'annual training plan,' which suggests this could be just the start of launches like this occurring more regularly. Especially as its nuclear arsenal grows in scale and scope, and its deterrence policies evolve along with that, China will need to increasingly demonstrate the full range of its capabilities and do so in more open and credible manners. As already noted, the United States and other nuclear powers routinely conduct open-ocean launches of nuclear-capable ballistic missiles for exactly these reasons. China's first open-ocean ICBM test since 1980 is still a major development by itself that highlights the country's still expanding nuclear and missile capabilities.

Search For Cargo Drone That Can Lift Twice As Much As A CH-53K Ki...	The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is looking to explore concepts for a new drone capable of lugging around up to 70,000 pounds (or 35 tons) of cargo, roughly twice what the U.S. Marine Corps' CH-53K King Stallion helicopter can lift. Unlike the CH-53K, the new uncrewed aircraft would be a shorter-range platform focused primarily on moving outsized payloads between ships and beachheads ashore, as well as across wide rivers and other similar 'gaps' inland. DARPA's Tactical Technology Office (TTO) recently put out a call for information about 'innovative and revolutionary concepts for heavy lift Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) that are capable of lifting a 70,000lb payload utilizing current Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) engines and drive train technology' as part of what it has dubbed the Cost Efficient Cargo project. The contracting notice explicitly notes that 'the Sikorsky CH-53K King Stallion is currently the American [military] helicopter with the highest payload capacity at 36,000lbs.' It is worth pointing out here that Sikorsky Skycrane helicopters, which have even greater lift capacity, remain in use in the commercial sector in the United States. The notice further outlines a notional mission profile for a future Cost Efficient Cargo drone wherein it would 'fly from a prepared base to the payload location [and] attach/obtain 70,000lb payload, traverse 25mi at 500ft, detach payload, [and then] return to base 25mi [away].' A CH-53K prepares to lift a non-flying F-35C test airframe. USN Beyond a desire for the drone to use a high degree of COTS components, the stated design requirements are very open-ended. DARPA's contracting notice indicates a willingness to consider uncrewed aircraft powered by traditional fuel-burning engines or electronic motors, or a hybrid combination of both. The projected mission profile and the comparison to the CH-53K, as a mention of 'rotors' also point to an interest in vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capable platforms. However, DARPA does not explicitly say this is a hard requirement. 'Autonomous functions are expected but not the focus of this RFI [request for information],' the contracting notice says. 'Additionally, DARPA is interested in identification of design insights and key risks that can be addressed within a scaled down form to further substantiate DoD investment in heavy lift systems and challenge the paradigm of current UAS design as a whole,' the Cost Efficient Cargo notice adds. A range of potential scaled payload capacities (10,000, 30,000, and 45,000 pounds) and ranges (10, 25, 50, and 100 miles) that are of interest are provided. 'The bottom line is that the U.S. needs to move large and heavy cargo cheaply. Examples are moving a 40ft ISO container off a container ship 10 miles out at sea onto land, or a Bradley fighting vehicle from one side of a canyon to the other,' according to DARPA. 'There are significant challenges in amphibious operations and land maneuvers, where armed forces must move troops, vehicles, and supplies from naval vessels to a beachhead and then across natural or man-made obstacles.' 'These operations are complicated by the need for landing craft and amphibious vehicles to navigate shallow waters, avoid obstacles, and contend with enemy defenses. The speed of movement is a critical operational need; any delays in offloading personnel and equipment during both the ship to shore phase and on shore wide gap crossings can expose forces to enemy fire and hinder the establishment of a secure foothold,' the contracting notice adds. 'Additionally, weather and sea conditions can severely impact the safety and efficiency of landings, while enemy defenses, including mines, artillery, and entrenched infantry, pose significant risks.' 'Once a foothold is secured, forces often encounter wide gaps, such as rivers, ravines, or destroyed bridges, that hinder the movement of heavy equipment,' it continues. 'These obstacles require engineering solutions such as pontoon bridges or amphibious vehicles, but such operations are time-consuming, giving the enemy time to prepare.' Concerns about ever-growing challenges in getting cargo from ships to shore, especially in higher-end conflict scenarios against opponents like China with substantial anti-access and area denial capabilities, are hardly new. Ever-more-capable anti-ship cruise missiles have been cited particularly often as a significant threat to amphibious warfare ships that will only increasingly limit how close they can get to shore. Launching forces, either in landing craft or amphibious vehicles, from further out to sea puts them at greater risk, as well. A map produced by the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments think tank highlighting the ranges of anti-ship and surface-air missile capabilities China could bring to bear in a future conflict. CSBA Even once a beachhead is established, friendly forces would still have to contend with a variety of threats. The U.S. military's recent experience operating a temporary pier to try to help get additional humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip underscores how weather and other environmental factors can present additional serious issues for amphibious operations. A satellite image showing the U.S. military's temporary pier anchored in Gaza damaged after rough weather in May 2024. Satellite image ©2024 Maxar Technologies As DARPA's Cost Efficient Cargo contracting notice highlights, gap-crossing operations inland across rivers and other obstacles, natural and man-made, face many of the same kinds of challenges. The ongoing war in Ukraine has underscored these realities, especially when it comes to the employment of temporary combat-bridging capabilities. The steady proliferation of longer-range precision-guided munitions and near-real-time intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities only increases the vulnerability of static crossing points.

A bunch of ammo got destroyed, the Russians ammo starved pic.twitter.com/aRxH5mToyS&mdash; PS01 △ (@PStyle0ne1) August 20, 2024 At the same time, there are questions about how effective and efficient a fleet of future heavy-lift drones, especially ones with limited range, might be in addressing the aforementioned issues. While a payload capacity of up to 70,000 pounds is substantial, so are the weights of the kinds of cargoes that DARPA envisions the Cost Efficient Cargo platform moving. For instance, the recent contracting notice specifically mentions the Bradley Fighting Vehicle. The typical weight of the latest M2A4 version of the Bradley with a full combat load is 80,000 pounds, according to manufacturer BAE Systems. The M2A4E1 Bradley seen here has an Iron Fist active protection system that makes it even heavier than the standard A4 variant. US Army A need for more drones flying more sorties to meet the desired mission demand could negatively impact the cost-effectiveness equation even if the underlying Cost Efficient Cargo system is relatively cheap to acquire and operate. It is worth noting that the same kinds of cost calculations already apply to crewed platforms. With a current unit price of around $118 million, the CH-53K is a notably expensive aircraft. The U.S. military does increasingly see drones carrying cargo and potentially personnel as key to meeting logistical requirements, especially in major conflicts, such as one against China in the Pacific. The U.S. Marine Corps, which has been completely restructuring itself around new expeditionary and distributed concepts operations in recent years, is pushing to acquire three different tiers of VTOL cargo drones. The Kaman KARGO drone depicted in the video below is one of the designs the Marine Corps is currently considering acquiring. The U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force, which expect to see their forces widely dispersed in future high-end fights, are also exploring VTOL (like the Piasecki ARES seen in the video below) and fixed-wing uncrewed aircraft to support logistics missions. However, none of the platforms U.S. military services are pursuing now have anywhere near the payload-carrying capacity DARPA is looking at for Cost Efficient Cargo. As The War Zone has highlighted in the past, the U.S. military is also increasingly lagging behind China in its development of uncrewed aerial logistics capabilities, especially when it comes to fixed-wing cargo-carrying drones. Two new Chinese cargo-carrying drones, one from ostensibly private firm Tengden and another from the state-run Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), separately made their first flights just earlier this year. How any heavy lift drones that come out of the Cost Efficient Cargo project might fit into the U.S. military's future air mobility ecosystem remains to be seen, but DARPA's new project reflects real operational demands and growing challenges in meeting them.

New Dutch Navy Support Vessels Will Be Missile-Toting Wingmen To ...	The Netherlands has unveiled plans for two new support vessels of a novel design that stresses modularity, including containerized weapons and sensors for a variety of different missions, and a relatively tiny crew. Reflecting current operational realities, each of the new ships will pack additional air defense missiles to help existing Dutch frigates put up more effective and persistent firepower in the face of the kinds of massed missile and drone attacks that have proliferated in the Middle East. In an announcement yesterday, the Dutch Ministry of Defense said that it would spend between €250 million and €1 billion ($279 million to $1.1 billion) on the two new support vessels. Varende gereedschapskisten. Zo kun je de 2 nieuwe multifunctionele ondersteuningsvaartuigen voor de @kon_marine ook wel noemen.

Wat voegen ze toe aan onze vloot? pic.twitter.com/0uB7rOjTGI&mdash; Gijs Tuinman (@DefensieStas) September 24, 2024 A Dutch Ministry of Defense told Defense News that the new ships will be around 174 feet long, with a beam of 32 feet, and will displace around 600 tons. This makes them significantly smaller than the De Zeven Provinciën class frigates, four of which spearhead the Royal Netherlands Navy. Each of these frigates is roughly 473 feet long, with a beam of 61 feet, and displaces around 6,600 tons, fully loaded. The Royal Netherlands Navy De Zeven Provinciën class frigate HNLMS Tromp (F803) in the Pacific Ocean for the RIMPAC 2024 exercise. Royal Netherlands Air Force photo by Sergeant-majoor Cristian Schrik OR-7 Cristian Schrik Perhaps most remarkably, the support vessels will each be operated by a crew of 'at least eight sailors,' according to the Dutch Ministry of Defense. This compares with a complement of around 230 sailors on each of the De Zeven Provinciën class. Despite their diminutive size and minimal crew, the support vessels will be notably well armed. As an adjunct to the De Zeven Provinciën class, which is primarily an air defense frigate, the new vessels will be equipped with Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) Barak-ER medium- to long-range surface-to-air missiles. The latest iteration of the Barak series, the ER version can hit targets at ranges of up to 93 miles and at altitudes of close to 100,000 feet. The Barak-ER is designed to engage a wide range of aerial targets, including aircraft, sea-skimming and cruise missiles, drones, glide bombs, and — as seen in the video below — tactical ballistic missiles. The Barak-ER is normally loaded in eight-round vertical launchers, and it was selected by the Netherlands in favor of the MBDA Aster, which cannot be fired from a container, and the Rafael Stunner, which reportedly failed to meet Dutch requirements. Meanwhile, production of the Standard Missile 2 (SM-2) Block IIIA that arms the De Zeven Provinciën class will soon come to an end, with the subsequent SM-2 Block IIICU not being compatible with the frigates’ fire-control systems. While this raises questions about the future armament of the De Zeven Provinciën class, once stocks of SM-2 Block IIIA missiles are expired or expended, it led to the decision to fit Israeli-supplied air defense missiles on the support vessels. At the same time, the Barak-ER missiles on these ships will be fully compatible with the De Zeven Provinciën class, meaning that the frigates can be responsible for target detection and targeting, commanding missile launches from the smaller vessels, which will effectively serve as additional floating magazine capacity. Official concept artwork of the new vessel shows the aft deck loaded with four containers, apparently for missiles, with six launch tubes in each. There are also two stacked containers at the far end of the boat, perhaps containing support equipment or electronics. HNLMS Tromp (F803) fires an SM-2 missile. Dutch Ministry of Defense RICHARD FRIGGE In a letter to parliament yesterday, Dutch State Secretary for Defense Gijs Tuinman shed more light on the concept of operations, describing the support vessel or vessels sailing 'at a short distance' from the air defense frigate, with missiles being 'launched from the support vessel [but] controlled by the frigate.' The need to boost Dutch naval air defense coverage was made clear by the campaign against Houthi missiles and drones targeting shipping in the Middle East in recent months, as well as Iran’s unprecedented, massed attack on Israel, using the same kinds of weapons. In particular, the limited stock of air defense missiles found on most warships has emerged as a concern and one that the support vessels will help address. Developments elsewhere in the world, including in China, suggest that swarming drones as well as ever more capable missiles will be a feature of naval warfare from now on. As well as air defense, the support vessels will be able to deliver fire support during amphibious operations, for which they will be armed with ship-launched Harop long-range loitering munitions, also supplied by IAI. With an endurance of up to nine hours, the Harop is designed to hunt high-value targets including unmanned surface vessels, command posts, supply depots, armored vehicles, and air defense systems. It patrols a designated area, seeking out targets with its electro-optical seeker, overseen by a ‘human-in-the-loop,’ before attacking. The addition of loitering munitions on warships of different kinds is something that has recently gained some traction and the many benefits have also been addressed in the past by the TWZ. With the Netherlands Marine Corps as one of the four Dutch armed forces, the country has long stressed amphibious capabilities and the acquisition of Harop loitering munitions is indicative of the increasing challenges faced by such operations. In particular, coastlines are now better defended, with enemies possessing long-range weapons and advanced sensors that can threaten amphibious landing forces. This also means the Dutch Armed Forces need to be better able to launch amphibious assaults at different locations simultaneously.

As we have discussed in the recent past, the Dutch are planning to acquire conventionally armed Tomahawk cruise missiles for their next class of submarines, as well as the AGM-158B Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range, or JASSM-ER, for its F-35A stealth fighters, and the Israeli-made PULS (Precise and Universal Launch System) multiple rocket launcher for the Royal Dutch Army.

Bartek Bera Another role that is being specified for the support vessels is as ‘motherships’ for uncrewed underwater vehicles (UUVs). Tuinman described using such drones to monitor and identify suspicious activity in the North Sea. Nefarious underwater activity by Russia, or other hostile actors is a growing worry for NATO. Oil and gas drilling platforms and pipelines, wind turbines, and power and data cables are among the key assets that the new vessels and attendant UUVs should help protect. The type of underwater drones to be acquired has not yet been confirmed, but they will be existing, off-the-shelf designs with long-range sensors. In 2021, undersea sensors off the coast of northern Norway that are used to collect data about passing submarines, among other things, were knocked out, and the following year an undersea fiberoptic cable located between mainland Norway and the Svalbard archipelago in the Arctic Ocean was also put out of action. Earlier this year, a critical communications cable associated with Evenes Air Station, in northern Norway was severed, although it’s not clear if that was also underwater when cut. Perhaps most prominently, in 2022, sabotage was put forward as the most likely reason for the mysterious gas leaks that struck two undersea pipelines in the Baltic Sea, after several explosions in the area. The leaks affected the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines, used to carry gas from Russia to Europe and which were at the center of an ‘energy war’ between Moscow and the West since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. One of the Nord Stream gas leaks photographed from a Danish F-16 fighter jet. Danish Armed Forces While the North Sea has apparently been spared incidents like these so far, it’s clear that the Netherlands is very aware of the potential for Russian-inspired aggression in these waters, including underwater activities. The defense ministry points to an episode this summer, when the Royal Netherlands Navy escorted a Russian research vessel in Dutch waters, with the intelligence services suspecting that the Russian ship was investigating opportunities for potential future sabotage. Overall, the Netherlands is now more heavily investing in underwater warfare capabilities, after years of neglect. As you can read about here, the Netherlands will also buy four new conventionally powered submarines from France, to replace its Cold War-era Walrus class and to contribute to its new-look defense posture. An artist’s impression of the future class of conventionally powered submarines for the Royal Dutch Navy. Dutch Ministry of Defense Returning to the new support ships, these will also be expected to 'jam an opponent’s radar systems,' with IAI also delivering unspecified electronic warfare equipment for the new boats. In particular, the boats’ electronic warfare capabilities will be expected to disrupt operations by hostile missiles and drones, suggesting that some kind of non-kinetic anti-drone system might also be installed. The small hull size means the ships won’t necessarily be truly multi-role but will instead have their weapons and perhaps also sensors packed in containers that can be easily swapped out. In this way, launch containers for Barak-ER missiles, for example, can be exchanged for those with Harop loitering munitions. Meanwhile, the fact that the primary ship has control of its weapons is a big advantage, reducing crew requirements and overall cost and complexity. The two new support vessels will be built by the Dutch shipyard Damen, with plans calling for the first to begin service as soon as 2026, with both vessels to be fully operational in 2027.

U.S. Navy photo by Naval Air Crewman (Helicopter) 2nd Class Reuben Richardson Lt.j.g. Kathleen Barrios Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the support vessels will be their use as a stepping-stone toward fully uncrewed operations by large-size surface vessels. With a crew of potentially a dozen sailors or less, these are already very nearly uncrewed surface vessels. Although the Dutch Ministry of Defense admits that the current technology doesn’t allow fully autonomous vessels, that is surely only a matter of time, and experience gained with these sparsely crewed ships should pave the way for that next frontier. In many ways, the Dutch support vessels mirror interest in the United States and other countries in large uncrewed surface vessels with modular weapons payloads, allowing them to be adapted for a range of missions as required. At the same time, having a minimally crewed ‘loyal wingman’-type ship also makes a lot of sense, especially since the ship and crew can be reconfigured based on operational requirements. Across the board, the Dutch Armed Forces are strengthening and modernizing as they adapt to the changing security environment in Europe and further afield. The two new support vessels represent a very interesting design, aiming to put a useful amount of defensive and offensive firepower and surveillance capabilities on a small and relatively inexpensive hull, with very little in the way of a crew to support these systems, but to have them work closely with more traditional warships. If successful, they may well pave the way for truly uncrewed surface combatants of similar size and capabilities.

Russia Poised To Capture Key Eastern Ukraine City	Surrounded on three sides by Russian forces, the city of Vuhledar in Ukraine's eastern region of Donetsk is on the verge of being captured after nearly three years of holding out. The long-fought-over city in the southeastern part of Donetsk was once home to about 14,000 people but now is a burnt-out wasteland after years of Russian assaults. It is another important linchpin in Ukraine’s defense of the region and its fall - which seems imminent - imperils the southern flank of Pokrovsk. As we have written many times, it is a key logistics hub ensconced by highways and bisected by a major rail line.

Vuhledar is semi-encircled, Col. Vladyslav Seleznyov, former head of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) General Staff press service, told the Kyiv Post. 'My prediction is that we will lose it in a few days, maybe even sooner,' he said, adding that Russian troops have entered an area of ​​multi-story buildings. In January and February 2023, the 72nd Mechanized Brigade of the AFU 'outnumbered and defeated Russian troops near Vuhledar, and has been defending this section of the front for two years,' the Kyiv Post noted. The 72nd is severely exhausted, Seleznyov said, and it remains uncertain whether the AFU’s General Staff has the resources to continue defending the city, given that Ukrainian forces are stretched thin across the entire front line. It was a morning in Vuhledar. The situation is critical, but the soldiers of the 72nd Brigade continue to hold the line. pic.twitter.com/No1aAOCvks&mdash; WarTranslated (Dmitri) (@wartranslated) September 24, 2024 Seleznyov's assessment of Vuhledar matches that of Ukrainian-born, pro-Russian military blogger Yuri Podolyaka. 'Russian units have entered Vuhledar – the storming of the town has begun,' he said in a post on Telegram on Sept. 23. The latest map from the open-source intelligence gathering group DeepState shows that Russian forces have to the edges of the city. Russia has almost encircled Vuhledar, about 35 miles south of Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine. (DeepState) The assault on Vuhledar has come with a heavy cost for Russia, losing a significant amount of troops and equipment over the past three years. Meanwhile, about 35 miles to the north, Russian troops continue to press toward Pokrovsk, but with limited gains over the past week. There are several other Donetsk cities in peril because of the Russian advance, including Toretsk. For Ukraine, on its heels across the 600-mile front lines, there was a modicum of good news. Ukrainian Intelligence Directorate (GUR) forces say they recaptured a large factory located in the bombed-out city of Vovchansk in Kharkiv Oblast. That's some 160 miles to the north of Vuhledar Russian troops have been holed up there since June. 'It was a difficult battle, but the soldiers of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine overcame the Russian invaders and won an important victory - with the strength of arms and spirit, mastery of thought and unprecedented courage,' GUR said on Twitter Tuesday.

Trump also said he is the only one who can stop the war, but exactly how remains unknown.

First Look At Mystery Object Shot Down Over Canada By F-22 Raptor...	Canadian authorities have released an image of an unidentified object that was shot down over the country's Yukon Territory by a U.S. Air Force F-22 Raptor stealth fighter in February 2023. This is the first image of any of a trio of still-unidentified objects that were downed over the United States and Canada that month, details about which remain scant. The new disclosure continues to raise more questions about those incidents given that the picture appears to have been declassified within days of the shootdown, but was then withheld from release until now. Canada's CTV News first published the image of what is also known as Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) 23, seen at the top of this story and below, along with an accompanying string of partially redacted internal emails from members of the Canadian armed forces earlier today. UAP is the term U.S., Canadian, and other authorities currently use to refer to what have been commonly described as unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the past. The outlet said it independently verified the records after recieving them from an unnamed source who had obtained them via an Access to Information request. Canada's Access to Information Act is similar in many respects to the U.S. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), but the former is only accessible to Canadian citizens. Canadian DND via Access to Information Request Via CTV News UAP 23 was downed over the Yukon on February 11, 2023. This came two days after another unidentified object, also known as UAP 20, was shot down in U.S. airspace off the northern coast of Alaska. A shootdown of a third unidentified object as it passed over Lake Huron came on February 12. This all followed U.S. and Canadian authorities tracking a Chinese spy balloon passing through their airspace for days before deciding to destroy it as it soared out over the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of South Carolina on February 4. The very low-resolution and grainy image we now have of UAP 23 shows a broadly doughnut-like shape with an open center, as well as an apparent notch or gap in its circumference on one side. It is possible that what is seen is light reflecting only from certain parts and that what is visible is not truly representative of its full shape. The quality of the picture, which CTV News notes 'appears to be a photocopy of an email printout,' makes it impossible to discern any definitive details. 'The image appears to have been taken from an aircraft below it, although that has not been confirmed,' CTV News' report adds. 'The best description we have is: Visual – a cylindrical object. The top quarter is metallic, remainder white. 20 foot wire hanging below with a package of some sort suspended from it,' one of the associated emails, dated February 11, 2023, says. Looking at the released picture again with this description in hand it looks like it might show a balloon catching the sun with a payload underneath. At the time, Canadian authorities described what had been shot down over the Yukon as a 'small, cylindrical object.' An F-22 Raptor stealth fighter, like the one seen here, shot down UAP 23 over the Yukon on February 11, 2023. USAF Senior Airman Julia Lebens 'It is unknown whether it [UAP 23] poses an armed threat or has intelligence collection capabilities,' according to a memo provided to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on February 15, 2023, says. 'The area in which the impact [after shootdown] occurred is a known (caribou) migration route, which opens the possibility of future accidental discovery by Indigenous hunters.' CTV News published the heavily redacted document, which it also received from an unarmed source who obtained it first via an Access to Information request, in September 2023. The release of the memo had already raised new and still largely unanswered questions about what Canadian and U.S. authorities may or may not know about the trio of downed objects, as well as what other UAPs had been monitored in either country's airspace before then, as you can read more about here. No remains of any of the three still-unidentified objects brought down in February 2023 are known to have been recovered. The owners and/or operators of those objects, and whatever their purposes might have been, remain unknown, at least publicly. Past reports have suggested UAP 23, specifically, may have been a so-called 'pico' balloon often launched by amateur radio enthusiasts. U.S. officials subsequently said that the trio of objects appeared to be benign, which looks to have been a direct factor in withholding the image of UAP 23 from the public. The unredacted portions of the newly disclosed Emails, which you can find here, show a clear push between February 11 and February 15, 2023, including from then-Canadian Chief of the Defense Staff Gen. Wayne Eyre, to not only declassify the image, but also proactively release it, including on social media. However, by the end of February 15, the emails have taken a decidedly different tone. Then-Canadian Chief of Defense Staff Gen. Wayne Eyre, at left, walks with Vice Chief of Space Operations Gen. David Thompson, at right, during a visit to the Pentagon in November 2023. USAF Eric Dietrich 'Should the image be released, it would be via the CAF [Canadian Armed Forces] social media accounts,' Taylor Paxton, then-acting Assistant Deputy Minister for Public Affairs with Canada's Department of National Defense, writes in one Email. 'Given the current public environment and statements related to the object being benign, releasing the image may create more questions/confusion, regardless of the text that will accompany the post.' Major Doug Keirstead, Public Affairs Officer to Chief of the Defense Staff, subsequently sent another Email to his boss, Gen. Eyre, reiterating advice from acting Assistant Deputy Minister Taylor, as well as others, to hold off on releasing the image 'pending U.S. engagement.' The War Zone has reached out to the U.S. Office of the Secretary of Defense and the U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) for more information. If the goal behind not releasing this image and any others from the Febraury 2023 shootdowns was to avoid confusion and speculation, it only appears to have had the opposite impact. The War Zone, along with others, has tried to obtain imagery from these incidents from the U.S. side on multiple occasions to no avail and we have called into question the puzzling optics of not doing so in the past. Amazing how quickly they declassified the MQ-9's MTS-B sensor footage of the Su-27 collision but we still haven't even gotten a single still frame of the 3 objects NORAD shot down over North America during the great balloon hunt. Quite telling.&mdash; Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) March 16, 2023 Even before February 2023, many members of Congress in the United States with access to classified information had criticized and otherwise called into question the U.S. military's attitude towards UAP issues, broadly. The Department of Defense did establish an All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) in 2022 as a focal point for tracking and investigating all things UAP, but significant questions have been raised since about its resourcing and authorities. There have also been as yet unsubstantiated accusations of AARO and others within the U.S. government engaging in more active coverups. 'Data release and footage is prioritized based on the geopolitical environment at the time,' then-head of AARO Sean Kirkpatrick said in response to a question from The War Zone about why imagery from the February shootdowns had not been released at a press briefing in October 2023. 'So engagements with Chinese fighters, Russian fighters have a much larger priority in getting it through the review process or declassification than UAPs or other similar engagements.' 'We are however, working through those processes, which all exist and we’ve got several of them actually already declassified and ready to update on our website [which] we’ll be doing on the next update to the website,' Kirkpatrick, who left AARO in December 2023, added at that time. 'And we’re putting them out as quickly as we can get them through their proper steps.' In a report released earlier this year, the Department of Defense's own Office of the Inspector General (DODIG) went so far as to warn that a continued 'lack of a comprehensive, coordinated approach to address' UAP issues 'may pose a threat to military forces and national security.' The War Zone has repeatedly highlighted the significant evidence that a substantial number of UAP sightings are not only explainable, but are likely drones, high-altitude balloons, and other uncrewed aerial assets that hostile actors are using to gather intelligence on critical capabilities and installations in and round the United States. A more recent Congressional effort to push for more UAP transparency through an amendment to the annual defense policy bill, or National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), for the 2025 Fiscal Year looks to have collapsed, at least for now.

F-35 Shown Carrying Stealthy Long-Range Anti-Ship Missiles For Th...	The Pentagon has, for the first time, released a photo showing an F-35 stealth fighter carrying an AGM-158C Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM). The stealthy standoff weapon, which is a derivative of the AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), will provide the F-35 with a powerful anti-surface warfare capability, something that will be especially important for a potential future high-end conflict in the Pacific against China. The photo was published today by the U.S. Department of Defense and shows a test flight out of NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, on September 10. A pair of LRASMs are seen on the inboard underwing pylons of a carrier-capable F-35C variant, assigned to the Pax River F-35 Integrated Test Force.

Lockheed Martin 'As part of ongoing integration efforts, the Pax River F-35 Integrated Test Force (Pax ITF) team flew two days of test flights to evaluate flutter, loads, and flying qualities with two AGM-158 loaded on external stations,' the accompanying caption reads. 'LRASM is a defined near-term solution for the Offensive Anti-Surface Warfare (OASuW) air-launch capability gap that will provide flexible, long-range, advanced, anti-surface capability against high-threat maritime targets.' The description of the stores as AGM-158s doesn’t rule out the possibility of versions of the baseline JASSM, but either way they are test articles, with the LRASM having the same mold line as the JASSM. An AGM-158C Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) in flight. USAF An AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) in flight. USAF As well as the F-35C, LRASM will be integrated onto the short takeoff and vertical landing F-35B variant. LRASM — like JASSM — cannot be carried internally by any F-35 variant. Externally carriage has an adverse effect on the aircraft’s stealth, but this is considered a reasonable price to pay for the weapons long-range precision attack capabilities and its own low-observable characteristics that make it highly survivable. As we have described in the past, LRASM uses a GPS-assisted inertial navigation system (INS) guidance system and careful route planning to bring it to the vicinity of the target area. On its way there, the weapon uses its highly adaptive routing capability, which allows it to automatically change course in response to ‘pop-up’ air defense threats. Those threats, in turn, are detected using LRASM’s built-in electronic support measures (ESM) package. Other threat updates are provided from external sources, via a datalink, which can allow for LRASMs to work cooperatively for coordinated strikes. Once the missile arrives in the target area, it activates an imaging infrared (IIR) seeker for the terminal phase of flight. The seeker searches for targets and autonomously classifies them using pre-programmed parameters that are stored in its threat target library database. The advanced seeker also ensures that the missile strikes the ship at its most vulnerable point. Since the seeker is passive, it can’t be detected by hostile ships, and it cannot be countered using radio-frequency jamming. Previously, there were plans for LRASM to also have the ability to strike targets ashore, but the Navy announced earlier this year that it had abandoned plans for this subvariant, as you can read about here. However, there are further improvements to LRASM in the pipeline. The AGM-158C-3 version — which once would have had land-attack capability — will include new software, enhanced beyond-line-of-sight data link, and improved survivability. Importantly, it will also have a range in line with that of the AGM-158B JASSM-ER — reportedly in the region of 600 miles. This compares with a range of between 200 and 300 miles for the baseline JASSM and LRASM, based on publicly available information. Until LRASM is cleared for carriage by the F-35, the Navy’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornets are currently the service’s only aircraft capable of employing variants of the missile. Integration efforts are also addressing other Navy platforms, including P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft. Here are the first images showing the #LRASM (Long Range Anti-Ship Missile) fitted on a P-8A Poseidon Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA) Naval News (@navalnewscom) April 4, 2023 The Air Force’s B-1B bombers can also launch LRASMs. LRASM is a big deal for the F-35, which currently lacks any dedicated anti-ship missile — at least until the full integration of the Norwegian-designed Joint Strike Missile (JSM), which can be carried internally, but is a multi-role land attack missile with anti-ship capabilities. While LRASM will provide the F-35B/C with a significant capability, it will ultimately serve as part of a mix of advanced anti-ship weapons, including hypersonic ones. Noteworthy is the fact that the AGM-158C-3 was originally developed under the OASuW Inc 2 program, which has since evolved into the Hypersonic Air-Launched Offensive Anti-Surface Warfare missile, or HALO. An artist’s conception of F/A-18F Super Hornets releasing hypersonic missiles. Boeing via Aviation Week As of earlier this year, it was planned for HALO to attain initial operational capability in Fiscal Year 2029. Although it will first be integrated onto the F/A-18E/F, it will likely subsequently be added to the F-35. The current efforts to integrate the baseline LRASM on the F-35 reflect a Pentagon-wide focus on the acquisition of new and improved anti-ship capabilities. With eyes on future contingencies in the Indo-Pacific region, we are currently seeing considerable interest in the development and fielding of a host of new ground-based surface-to-surface missile systems with anti-ship capabilities, as well as air-launched weapons like LRASM.

What Would A Far Cheaper Next Generation Air Dominance Fighter Ac...	The Air Force's long-touted 6th generation Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) crewed 'fighter' program is under deep review, with massive revisions to what the service wants out of it being a real possibility at this point. After originally stating this very advanced aircraft that would sit as the centerpiece of the NGAD family of systems would cost roughly three times that of a new F-35 (upwards of $300M plus each), Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall is now eying pursuing a far less expensive aircraft, one that will cost around what a fresh F-35 or F-15EX does, which is very roughly around $90M-$100M apiece. At the Air & Space Forces Association's 2024 Air, Space, Cyber conference outside of Washington, D.C. last week, Secretary Kendall told reporters, including TWZ's Howard Altman, that the reevaluation of what the USAF wants out of the NGAD crewed jet is underway and by his own words, the resulting changes could be dramatic: 'I'll just give you this off the top of my head here, that the F-35 kind of represents, to me, the upper bounds of what we'd like to pay for an individual [NGAD] aircraft for that mission. &#8230; The F 15EX and F-35 are roughly in the same cost category. I'd like to go lower though. There are - once you start integrating CCAs and transferring some mission equipment and capabilities [and] functions to the CCAs, then you can talk about a different concept, potentially, for the crewed fighter that's controlling them. So there's a real range in there. We need a unit cost that's affordable in significant numbers, though. So that's part of the equation. And, I mean, NGAD [the original combat jet concept] itself is still a possibility. It's one of the things we're looking at. But the numbers there are, you know, as I've said in public before, they're multiples of an F-35 right? So we'd like to get down from that. But if that turns out to be the most cost effective operational answer, that's what we're gonna do and go fight for the money to have it. You end up with small numbers. I mean, the more the airplane costs, the fewer of them you're gonna have. Numbers do matter. So it's a trade off.' So what could a 6th generation fighter that costs one-third of the original NGAD requirements actually look like? Is it even possible? Let's get into it. Decentralizing/distributing to the extreme As we have discussed for years, the crewed NGAD component was being designed from the ground up as a central part of an ecosystem of next-generation tactical air combat technologies. These include above all else Collaborative Combat Aircraft 'loyal wingmen' drones, but also new weapons, communications architectures, sensors, engines, and more. They could also include other types of undisclosed drones, but more advanced, independent-operating, deep-penetrating types of the tactical variety don't seem to be even on the table at this time. You can read more about that in our recent reporting here. One advantage of such a 'family of systems' is that critical features that had to be on every single fighter of the same type in the past can be distributed across multiple platforms. For instance, if the goal is just about getting a human in the loop within line-of-sight to control CCAs and manage the tactical ballet, the fighter could have no radar or any other types of sensors of its own. Instead, radars, infrared search and track systems (IRST), and electronic support measures, as well as electronic warfare capabilities, could be dispersed to modular CCAs and potentially other platforms in their vicinity. Some of these functions could even provided by space-based platforms/constellations and data-linked to the aircraft in real time. While this may be possible, it's very risky and it takes the distributed sensor concept to the extreme. It also severely limits the aircraft's applications when CCAs are not in use. It still would be prudent to give the fighter some independent sensing capabilities, perhaps a single radar array for use cooperatively with other platforms and as a fallback for certain tactical contingencies — more on that in a minute. A far more elaborate installation of cutting-edge multi-mode arrays distributed around or even made part of the airframe itself may not be within the cost limitations of a revised NGAD fighter program. You can read all about this capability here. Still, the NGAD fighter relying more heavily on CCAs for these functions has some upside. These drones will fly closer to targeted threat areas anyway and they will be data-linked together, allowing for cooperative sensing tactics and a higher degree of triangulation of targets, which in many cases would provide superior fidelity and more resilient sensor data. This is exactly the distributed payload concept we described in great detail back in 2016 and the USAF has become increasingly focused on it as of late. Aircraft like the XQ-67 Off-Board Sensing Station (OBSS) appear to be a trial platform for just this kind of sensor-carrying tactical drone, for instance, but CCAs will be capable of being configured for these roles, as well. Still, by relying on distributed sensor and electronic warfare payloads for CCAs more heavily, the NGAD fighter will be less capable on its own, especially in a very high-end fight. This would mean that the drone and crewed fighter will be tied even closer together operationally, with the fighter depending on them and the networking that connects to them even more heavily for tactical success. There are also logistical and attrition concerns with such a bet, but a balance more heavily weighted toward CCA when it comes to sensor and electronic warfare system deployment is more likely than going to the extreme end of the distributed concept and stripping the manned aircraft of most or even all of its sensors. While removing advanced sensors and electronic warfare gear from an aircraft, or replacing these systems with simpler options, would definitely save on cost and it could help reduce the size of airframe itself, where the cost really comes into play is payload, range, and speed. Payload reduction NGAD was always largely thought to be a heavy interceptor-like aircraft, featuring a comparatively very large combat radius that is optimized for fighting in the Pacific where tankers will be pushed back beyond the range of most fighter aircraft to their target areas, at least early in a conflict. It would also have to carry a large payload of diverse weaponry internally so that it can maintain its low-observable (stealth) abilities that would be critical to its survival while also delivering a heavy punch deep inside contested airspace. Just for the air dominance role, not deep strike, a large number of air-to-air and suppression/destruction of enemy air defenses (SEAD/DEAD) weapons would be needed for the aircraft to fight its way in and out of an area where external support would be extremely limited. Two factors could drastically change this calculus. The concept of a very heavy NGAD 'fighter' aircraft may be numbered. (Collins) The first is a much heavier reliance on CCAs for standard weapons carriage and on other platforms for larger, outsized weapons delivery. Putting the magazine depth focus more on drones instead of the central controlling platform could drastically reduce the size of aircraft needed to perform the mission. It could be argued that it would also provide a greater degree of survivability in some situations as the crewed asset would not have to (or even have a reason to in some cases) get within launch distance of many threats. Instead, the CCAs almost exclusively would, with the fighter element hanging even further back at a safer distance than originally planned. Such tactics could also become more pressing as enemy air defense capabilities continue to evolve, specifically when it comes to fusing information from various sensors to spot even very stealthy aircraft at a distance. A massive reduction in payload requirement and likely the inclusion of more CCAs on a typical mission would also allow for more tactical flexibility in some instances. Larger weapons, such as very long-range air-to-air missiles, could be carried by assets like the B-21 Raider deeper into contested environments, while F-15EXs and B-52s could do the same along the outer edge of higher-threat areas, at least in some situations. These aircraft could launch these weapons on demand of the crewed NGAD fighter operating far forward. It could even be argued that funds set aside for a very costly NGAD fighter could be partially invested in buying additional B-21s and even F-15EXs to support NGAD-related air dominance missions. B-21 Raider undergoing flight test. (USAF) Giancarlo Casem Reducing the payload requirements of the NGAD fighter would reduce the complexity and size of the fighter platform. This could save a lot of money, as everything from the propulsion requirements to the physical size of the airframe would be decreased. This is not to say such a configuration would be unarmed. Still, reducing its weapons bay size to carry say a quartet of AIM-120s or AIM-260s, along with a pair of AIM-9X Sidewinders or four Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) sized air-to-ground weapons, could be enough for contingencies and for mundane operations in less contested airspace, such as in the Middle East, where CCAs may not even be a factor for normal missions. Less gas An even bigger factor is fuel. It is valid to assume that the original NGAD concept placed fuel carriage as a premium design driver. This aircraft had to fly far from tanker support, into the enemy's anti-access bubble and back in order to be relevant. Now the USAF is increasingly aggressive about fielding a stealthy tanker that can operate at least at the very edge of contested airspace. America's tactical airpower was not built for fighting over long distances without tanker support being in relatively close proximity. Its fighters have combat radii roughly between 350 and 850 miles or so. This puts the tankers at risk as an enemy's anti-access bubble can now extend many hundreds and even thousands of miles from its territory. NGAD and CCAs, which will have significantly larger combat radii than current fighter aircraft, were viewed as a way to correct for this huge capability gap, but if the USAF is now moving to build a stealth tanker, the need for a much longer-ranged 6th generation crewed tactical jet could be offset to some degree. TWZ made the case for a stealth tanker years ago based on all these issues and more. At the time many blew it off as fantasy. This is no longer the case as the factors that dictate the need for such a capability have only grown more pressing in recent years as the U.S. military faces a potential massive fight in the Pacific with China and as air defenses become ever-more sophisticated and longer-ranged. The USAF is now accelerating its next-generation tanker initiatives with an increasing focus on fielding low-observable tankers, which it just said will be directly tied to its final NGAD plans. So, if the USAF is willing to assume a lot more risk while also committing to fast-tracking a stealthy tanker, it could possibly justify a NGAD fighter with a significantly smaller combat radius and shrink the cost and complexity of the airframe even further. A notional tanker concept with low-observable characteristics. (Lockheed Martin Skunk Works) Slower and lower Then there are the kinematic performance concessions that could be made with a revised NGAD design. In a previous thought piece, we explored the possible performance targets of the crewed NGAD component. You can check that feature out here. Regardless, the ability to fly higher and faster for longer periods of time, even while deeply sacrificing maneuverability, are likely design drivers. Sustained supercruise (flying over Mach 1 without the use of afterburner) and higher ceilings while also not guzzling precious fuel come at a heavy cost. The F-22, for instance, is well known for its supercruise capability, but it still zaps the jet's endurance and is used for high-risk tactical portions of a mission, not for regularly transiting longer distances faster. Flying at higher altitudes, like the F-22 which can operate normally at altitudes in excess of 60,000 feet, is also a major plus. Just the ability to give sensors and datalinks a much longer line-of-sight is a big plus, as is the additional range imparted onto weapons fired at those altitudes. By relaxing high or even breakthrough performance requirements, with all the material science and development costs that goes with it, an airframe could drop in complexity and cost fairly dramatically. A notional NGAD-like fighter. (Boeing via Air &#038; Space Forces) Maybe above all else, reducing the goals of NGAD's next-generation engine initiative, the Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion (NGAP) program, alongside reductions in performance targets could also save a lot of money, both in development costs and eventual production expenditures. Using a derivative of an existing powerplant, and a single one possibly instead of two, would be even one step further in cost reduction, but with all this would come degraded performance and less advancement in engine technologies, which is a real concern long-term. Barrow everything you can Borrowing existing subsystems more deeply could also save a lot of money and development time. For instance, leveraging and adapting the F-35's Block IV digital backbone and software, as well as even some sensors and communications systems, and scaling in or out other features, could result in a large acceleration of the program and reduction in cost. It would also benefit from large economies of scale baked into the F-35 program, as well as its existing expansive sustainment infrastructure that will exist for decades. There is a real push for the USAF to retain rights to the NGAD aircraft's intellectual property and not be locked into one vendor. Deeply adapting a partially off-the-shelf architecture may not be able to achieve this goal, but it could be seen as a worthy trade if deep cost-cutting up-front is seen as more important. An F-35A in flight above the Mojave Desert in California, January 6, 2023. A developmental test team from the 461st Flight Test Squadron conducted the first flight of an F-35 in the Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) configuration at Edwards Air Force Base, California. TR-3 is the hardware backbone that will enable the aircraft's long-awaited Block IV upgrades. (412th Test Wing) F-35 Joint Program Office When paired with major performance reductions, mechanical subsystems could also be more easily carried over from other platforms to the 'cheap' NGAD fighter concept. There is a long track record of this in the past, especially with smaller-run aircraft, like the F-117, and experimental aircraft. But it is also worth noting that it is well known that the B-21 program strategically leveraged a mix of mature and semi-mature subsystems to speed development and keep costs on track. The USAF would be clearly keen on this practice considering the B-21's success thus far. Leaving breakthrough capabilities behind Having a new aircraft with every bell and whistle possible is becoming less realistic as costs of new weapons systems and the dollars needed to sustain them skyrockets. This means that some major new features that were planned for the $300M NGAD fighter may not make the cut. Even having the capacity to install them in the future could also be left on the cutting room floor in an effort to make the aircraft affordable. One example of this kind of sacrifice could be laser weaponry, which was envisioned as a core feature of NGAD, but putting these systems on aircraft has since hit massive snags. The weight, volume, complexity, power generation and thermal management needed in order to field even a defensive laser system would be significant. As the airframe, payload and performance shrinks, this becomes a clearer mismatch and the technological hurdles that remain could be seen as major stumbling block for the program. Even the AC-130 has lost its laser weapon before it even arrived for a number of factors, but integrating a system like that onto a cargo aircraft is far less complex than an advanced stealth fighter. An earlier concept of a 6th generation manned tactical jet showing a laser weapon being fired. (Northrop Grumman) There are a number of other similar concepts that may have to remain aspirational or find their way onto other platforms so that an NGAD fighter can actually get built. Reductions in all these areas would absolutely result in a significantly cheaper aircraft, but it would also mean trading a massive amount of capability in the process, while also gambling even more heavily on the CCA concept, which still remains&#8230; a concept. Certainly, some will ask why not just use the F-35? This likely comes down to the most important factor on this rundown: survivability. Advanced shell, less advanced core What this airframe would likely retain in common with its three times more expensive progenitor option is a very high degree of broadband low-observability (stealth), allowing it to operate close to the core of highly advanced integrated air defense networks. A tailless new-generation stealth airframe could really be a primary feature. Putting a priority on efficient propulsion and minimizing weapons payload could still provide a notably larger combat radius than the F-35, although the F-35A and C are towards the top end of the existing fighter combat radius scale as it is. This aircraft's central goal could be refocused on keeping the human pilot alive and present far forward at the technical edge to employ CCAs and to leverage the rest of the NGAD ecosystem to achieve desired outcomes. Its ability as a long-range heavy fighter let alone strike aircraft for truly independent operations would be far more limited. It could rely more on future advances in ancillary and distributed technologies to remain relevant than purely its installed 'bleeding edge' capabilities. A notional 6th generation fighter. (Lockheed Martin) So what we could be talking about is a smaller, lighter, less armed, less independent, and shorter-ranged concept that still puts a premium on low-observable technologies. Interestingly, in some ways, such a switch would mirror what happened with the Next Generation Bomber (NGB). It was an absolute top-of-the-line design initiative that was later soft-cancelled and out of its ashes came the Long-Range Strike-Bomber (LRS-B) program. This was a far less ambitious initiative that focused heavily on cost and timeline controls, repurposing mature and semi-mature components and technologies, and rationalizing what is essential and what is not — including payload — and then wrapping it in a very stealthy next-generation broadband low-observable package. It too would also rely on a 'family of systems' made up of unique technologies and platforms to successfully complete its future missions. Does this sound familiar in relation to the changing messaging from the USAF brass on NGAD? It should. What's also interesting is the USAF abstractly floated a 6th generation light-to-medium fighter concept recently, although they just said it was a thought exercise, not indicative of a real plan. But even introducing such an idea, including concept art to support it, is an odd move when the service is focusing on getting all its top priorities met, including investments in F-35, F-15EX, NGAD, CCA, and especially incredibly costly nuclear modernization. It seems like there could be a bit more to that 'thought exercise' than what we were told, which is what we thought at the time. That doesn't mean a cheap NGAD fighter would look like what was shown, that really wouldn't make sense, but it certainly fits the general direction that is now formally on the table. Rendering regarding a thought experiment for a lighter next-generation fighter. (USAF) Even with this big cocktail of measures focused on drastically reducing the unit price of a future NGAD fighter aircraft, could it really be dropped to around $100M? It's tough to say. If most of what is described above was done to the maximum logical extent, it may be possible once the type hits full-rate production, if the latest in manufacturing techniques are brought to bear, as well. Still, that seems like a stretch, especially without increasing the buy far beyond the 200 airframes Kendall has floated before. If that number is drastically expanded, it would have a better chance of meeting that price target. Above all else, what we do know now is the flying service remains behind the curve and still uncertain of how it will maintain air supremacy in a rapidly changing security environment in which peer competition hasn't been as tangible as it is today for decades. Can the USAF really stay ahead of China by going the much cheaper route for its crewed NGAD component? Or is the better course to just focus on and broaden the uncrewed technology side of the portfolio and divert funds away from a crewed NGAD aircraft altogether? We will be addressing these larger issues in another future piece, but as it sits now, it sure seems like the NGAD fighter program could be about to change, and fairly dramatically so.

Navy Resupply Ship Mishap Could Have Big Impact On Mid-East Deplo...	An at-sea mishap involving the U.S. Navy's Military Sealift Command (MSC) oiler USNS Big Horn is highlighting concerns about the Navy’s ability to sustain itself given the limited number of such vessels. The issue is especially acute given that the Big Horn’s mission was to refuel the ships and aircraft in the Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group (CSG) now in the tumultuous U.S. Central Command region. The Big Horn 'was damaged while operating at sea in the U.S. Fifth Fleet area of operations overnight on Sept. 23,' a Navy official told The War Zone Tuesday morning. It’s not looking good. I’ve been told by a shipowner the Navy does not have a spare oiler to deploy and is scrambling to find a commercial oil tanker to refuel the Abraham Lincoln carrier group.Updates over at gCaptain forum: pic.twitter.com/ec2oN3CpSf&mdash; John Ʌ Konrad V (@johnkonrad) September 24, 2024 'All crew members are currently safe and U.S. 5th Fleet is assessing the situation,' said the official, adding that the Big Horn is currently being towed to an unspecified port in the region. A second Navy official told The War Zone that the damage to the Big Horn will likely take months to repair. The Big Horn was the only oiler in the region because the USNS Supply returned to port, that official confirmed. It arrived in Norfolk, Virginia in June as one of the last ships to return from a nine-month deployment with the Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group, according to WTKR TV. 'The Navy will have to move another [oiler] into the theater,' said the second official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss operational details. The mishap was first reported by John Konrad of GCapatain, who said the vessel ran aground off Oman. It comes at a critical juncture, with hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah heating up. That is sparking concerns of a wider conflict that could draw in the U.S., which is now planning to move additional troops into the region as a result, the Pentagon’s top spokesman, Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, told reporters on Monday. The Lincoln CSG arrived in the U.S. Central Command region late last month 'as part of broad adjustments to [the] U.S. military posture to ensure U.S. force protection, increase support for the defense of Israel and ensure the United States is prepared to respond to a wide range of contingencies,' said Pentagon Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh at the time. USS Abraham Lincoln departs Naval Station North Island on July 11, 2024. US Navy PhotoU.S. Navy As we noted in the past, the Dwight D. Eisenhower CSG had an extremely active seven-month deployment to the region before leaving in June. It fired nearly 800 munitions as it battled the Houthi rebels of Yemen and helping protect Israel against a massive missile and drone barrage from Iran. You can read more about that deployment from the viewpoint of the carrier's commander, Navy Capt. Chris 'Chowdah' Hill, in our interview here. A similarly high-tempo deployment for the Lincoln CSG could be adversely affected by the Big Horn now out of commission for a while, said the second Navy official, adding that it depends on what contingencies U.S. Naval Forces Central (NAVCENT) have in place. We reached out to NAVCENT and MSC for comment. MSC deferred questions to NAVCENT, which has yet to respond. We will update this story with any pertinent information provided. The temporary loss of the Big Horn 'could potentially constrain the level of air operations and ship operations' for the Lincoln CSG, Sal Mercogliano, a maritime historian, former Merchant Marine and host of the WGOW Shipping podcast, told The War Zone. 'They may have to send ships into port to refuel. What capacity exists for underway refueling would be reserved for the carrier.' The U.S. Military Support Command only has 14 Kaiser class oilers like the Big Horn and two Supply class oilers. Adding to the pressures are that five Kaiser class oilers are in shipyards while the remainder are spread out across the globe., Mercogliano pointed out. This week’s @mscsealift 'Ship in the Spotlight' is fleet replenishment oiler USNS Big Horn (T-AO 198). The vessel is providing logistic support to @USNavy and allied ships in the @US5thFleet.

Both the second Navy official and Mercogliano said that the Big Horn mishap will have effects beyond just the Lincoln CSG. 'This will have a cascading effect across the Navy,' said the second Navy official. 'Given the limited number of oilers, to have an unscheduled loss affects ships around the world, because she will have to be replaced for some period of time and there are only 14 of them.' US Navy Oiler Runs Aground, Forcing Carrier Strike Group to Scramble for Fuel I HATE THIS STORY. But what it demonstrates is the fragility of our maritime logistics system to support the fleet.

Willam A Brown, President of the National Defense Transportation Association (NDTA), expressed confidence in NAVCENT’s ability to sustain the Lincoln CSG. 'While this is a significant event, there are multiple options to refuel the carrier strike group—and NDTA is confident MSC, the US Navy and USTRANSCOM have options in their playbook to meet the highest demands which the strike group could meet,' Brown said in a statement to The War Zone. Even before the Big Horn mishap, there were major concerns about the Navy's ability to supply itself in a high-end fight against an adversary like China. Such a battle would take place over great swaths of ocean against an adversary with major anti-access/area-denial capabilities. Such a conflict would put a major strain on the small fleet of oilers. This is not even factoring in potential attrition of these ships which would be top targets for an adversary as taking them out would degrade a carrier strike group's capabilities significantly and reduce their tactical flexibility.

New Radar Sought To Help X-62A Test Jet Take Next Leap In Autonom...	The U.S. Air Force is interested in adding an active electronically-scanned array (AESA) radar to its X-62A test jet. The radar is part of larger plans to acquire a new modular sensor suite to further expand the capabilities of the uniquely modified F-16, which has already assumed a key role in advanced exploratory work for autonomous air combat drones. Following the announcement that the X-62A had taken part in a first-of-its-kind artificial intelligence-driven dogfight earlier this year, The War Zone highlighted how uninterrupted 360-degree situational awareness will be essential for truly making autonomous close-in air-to-air combat a reality. Air Force officials at Edwards Air Force Base first put out a call for information about potential AESA radar options for the X-62A back in August, but only stopped taking submissions last Friday. Also known as the Variable Stability In-flight Simulator Test Aircraft (VISTA), the jet is assigned to the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School (USAF TPS) at Edwards. The X-62A, with Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall aboard, takes off from Edwards for a demonstration flight in May 2024. USAF 'The potential radar upgrade is for the X-62 Variable In-Flight Simulator Test Aircraft (VISTA) in support of a Mission Systems Upgrade (MSU),' the contracting notice explains. 'The upgraded radar will be part of a set of modular components that can be used individually or together to provide sensory input to aircraft.' 'At the end of the mission systems upgrade, the aircraft will be capable of processing raw data from the AESA radar in an autonomy enclave that can use machine learning to process the data and directly control the sensors using either the existing modes available via the radar OFP [operational flight program] or via experimental modes and experimental combinations of modes inaccessible or unachievable by human use,' the notice adds. The notice also lays out a number of core requirements for an AESA to go onto the X-62A, including that it not weigh more than 200 pounds, be air-cooled, and have a startup time of under two minutes. It 'must be an AESA radar that can [be] operated in an unclassified mode' and 'be one that 'possess both an Air to Air and Air to Ground modes.' 'Raw AESA data must be available for computation external to AESA processing unit,' the contracting notice adds. The air-cooled requirement notably precludes the potential use of Northrop Grumman's AN/APG-83 AESA radar, also known as the Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR), which hundreds of operational Air Force F-16s are in the process of receiving. The SABR, which you can read more about here, is a liquid-cooled design. There are other AESAs on the market now could meet the stated requirements for installation on the X-62A. Raytheon's PhantomStrike, which is an air-cooled type that also weighs around 150 pounds, and is otherwise designed to be compact to help ease integration on a wide array of crewed and uncrewed aircraft, is one example. The ELM-2052 from ELTA, a subsidiary of Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), is another compact AESA that has been growing in popularity, including as an upgrade option for existing aircraft types, though it's not immediately clear if it meets the cooling and weight stipulations. A rendering depicting a PhantomStrike radar installed in the nose of a Kratos XQ-58 Valkyrie drone highlighting the compactness of the design. Raytheon It's unclear what radar the X-62A has now, but the two-seat Block 30 F-16D on which it is based would have come standard with a mechanically-scanned pulse-doppler AN/APG-68. In general, AESAs offer improved range, as well as greater precision and fidelity of tracks even when it comes to smaller or stealthy objects, compared to mechanically-scanned types. They are also more reliable and offer increased resistance to electronic warfare jamming. As such, a new AESA would give the X-62A valuable new capabilities, as well as better overall situational awareness. This, in turn, could be extremely useful for future autonomy testing work, including more advanced mock air-to-air engagements. After the ground-breaking dogfight earlier this year, the Air Force disclosed that the X-62A's systems had been directly exchanging position and other 'state information' with the crewed F-16 it was dueling with, primarily for safety reasons. As The War Zone has previously explored in detail, data-linking the X-62A to the crewed F-16 also made sense for practical reasons, but underscored significant challenges to overcome to truly demonstrate autonomous air-to-air combat capability against a completely unknown threat. The addition of a more modern radar is not enough by itself to address the issues at hand. As we wrote: 'Despite over a century of military aviation advancements, dogfighting remains a visual affair where a human pilot’s on-the-spot judgment, intuition, and stereo vision are critical. An aircraft’s sensor suite, including radar, electro-optical and infrared cameras, and electronic warfare and support measures systems, can provide a wealth of data about enemy contacts. However, their utility steadily diminishes, if it does not largely collapse, as the distance to the target closes to very close-in maneuvering range. A radar in the nose of an aircraft, for instance, can only ‘see’ what’s in a cone-shaped area in front of it. Even existing 360-degree camera systems have two-dimensional limitations and can be hampered by environmental conditions. Datalinked information from external sources can be extremely valuable for building situational awareness or even guiding weapons, but it also has limited in fidelity. External tracks of the enemy and friendly fighters can merge together at very close range.' &#8230; 'The X-62A simply does not have any kind of organic sensor suite that would give it the uninterrupted 360-degree situational awareness that truly autonomous dogfighting would require. This is something that will have to be addressed when it comes to the development of future autonomous platforms. Arrays of small conformal radars, electro-optical or infrared cameras, and other sensors could be utilized to provide the necessary situational and spatial data, in effect working together to build telemetry for creating a solid digital three-dimensional ‘picture’ of what is going on directly around the jet during a fast developing dogfight.' As the contracting notice about the new AESA for the X-62A notes, the radar is just one element of a planned suite of new sensors for the jet. If the Air Force uses a modular, open-architecture approach it could also help make it easier to add new and improved capabilities and functionality in the future. USAF The unique X-62A Variable-stability In-flight Simulator Test Aircraft (VISTA) seen here flew in a fully autonomous mode against a crewed F-16 fighter in a milestone mock dogfight in September 2023. USAF 'There is a plan and there is a development pathway in the future to incorporate sensing, and the complexity that that [sic] adds to the picture,' Air Force Col. James Valpiani, the commandant of the USAF TPS, told The War Zone and others at a media roundtable about the X-62A's dogfight back in April. 'Doing this in a safe and responsible way is to take it one step at a time to truly understand how each aspect works before moving on to the next problem.' Using pilot-optional surrogates like the X-62 presents additional benefits when it comes to accelerating testing and reducing risk and eliminates bottlenecks associated with domestic U.S. airspace restrictions currently placed on completely uncrewed platforms. The War Zone recently explored all of this in more detail in the context of the new stealthy Model 437 Vanguard technology demonstrator jet from Northrop Grumman subsidiary Scaled Composites. With this in mind, the Air Force has also been putting together a test force of six additional specially configured F-16s to further support advanced autonomy work as part of a project called VENOM (Viper Experimentation and Next-Gen Operations Mode). The VENOM jets are not being modified anywhere near to the same degree as the X-62A, but will also reportedly have AESA radars, as well as the warning sensors that go along with their electronic warfare suites. One of the first F-16s set to be converted into an autonomy testbed under Project VENOM arrives at Eglin Air Force Base on April 1, 2024. USAF 'The VENOM aircraft are the platforms that will have the ability to sense the environment around them and do some of the things that we presently have some limitations on VISTA with,' Air Force Lt. Col. Ryan Hefron, head of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Air Combat Evolution (ACE) program, also said at the April roundtable. 'Not to say … that we won’t continue to work on [ACE using] VISTA, because we absolutely will. There are certain things that the [X-62A] aircraft is capable of performing that won’t be, I’ll say, well suited on the VENOM birds… They each have their own unique place, I’ll say, as testbeds.' ACE is the program under which the X-62A's artificial intelligence-driven dogfight was conducted and is among a number of efforts that are directly feeding into the Air Force's Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drone program. The service's plans for its CCAs are expected to evolve significantly as time goes on, but the main focus initially is on air-to-air combat in support of crewed platforms, as you can read more about in detail here. How much autonomy the first batches of CCAs might have and where humans will be in or on 'the loop' remain very open questions. 'We know two things about autonomy,' Andrew Hunter, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology & Logistics, more recently told The War Zone and other outlets at a media roundtable on the sidelines of the Air & Space Forces Association's main annual conference last week. 'One is laws of war require us to have, you know, human engagement in key decisions involving employment of weapons and other key decisions. So we have to have that. We have to have that human engagement, the ability to do that. The second is [that] we know that our ability to create systems that can operate autonomously and do missions well is something that is still maturing.' 'So, in other words, there are things that we know that we already know how to do well with autonomy, and there’s things that we know we do not know how to do well with autonomy,' Hunter continued. 'So we’re going to stick to the things we know we can do well, and then have humans do the other things, and, over time, that mix is going to change… it’s not going to be static.' The X-62A fitted with a new AESA radar and other sensors looks set to be an important part of how the Air Forces goes about defining its future autonomous air combat ecosystem.

Russian Destroyer Fired Warning Shots At Norwegian Fishing Boat: ...	A Russian Navy warship fired warning shots at a Norwegian fishing vessel in the Arctic Ocean earlier this month, according to an account from the boat’s skipper. The Russian Udaloy class destroyer, Admiral Levchenko, was taking part in large-scale maneuvers off the Norwegian coast, a region of increasingly strategic importance to both Moscow and NATO. The incident is said to have happened on September 12 when the 49-foot fishing boat MS Ragnhild Kristine was in the Norwegian exclusive economic zone (EEZ), north of Vardø, in the Barents Sea, off Norway’s northern coast.

As the boat’s captain explained to FriFagbevegelse, a Norwegian news website: 'I get called up on the radio. ‘This is Russian warship; you need to leave the area.’ I repeated that we should pull up our lines. Then the Russian warship comes at us at full speed…' The Russian captain explained that the warship was taking part in a live-fire exercise, but his Norwegian counterpart refused to move.

The ship is 200 meters [650 feet] from us … It’s slightly threatening, you might say. They turn on the typhoon foghorn for about 15 seconds to get our attention. Then he fires a cannon somewhere in the sea. There’s a loud bang and the hull shakes violently.' The fishing vessel was not hit and it’s unclear if the Russian warship fired a live round or an inert one. The crew of the fishing boat assessed that some kind of projectile came down in the water near their vessel and exploded. The Admiral Levchenko is armed with two single 100mm AK-100 dual-purpose guns and four AK-630M 30mm Gatling-type guns for close-in defense. These are in addition to Rastrub anti-submarine missiles, Kinzhal short-range surface-to-air missiles, torpedoes, and RBU-6000 anti-submarine rocket launchers. The Russian Udaloy class anti-submarine warfare destroyer Admiral Levchenko. Neill Rush/Wikimedia Commons 'After the bang, we agreed to go west. It was ‘voluntary coercion,’ as it was called when I was in the military,' the Norwegian captain explained. 'He led us all the way out of the field. The Norwegian Coast Guard also came down and talked to the Russians.' A spokesperson for the Norwegian Joint Headquarters said that a radio conversation took place between the vessels but said it was not able to confirm that a warning shot was fired. Regardless, Russian live-fire exercises in these waters are not unheard of and are announced in advance, however, Norwegian commercial vessels don’t necessarily have to leave the EEZ — which is in international waters — during military exercises. In the past, this has led to consternation from Norwegian fishermen, due to the potential risks as well as lost revenues. In this case, however, the crew of the Ragnhild Kristine says they didn’t receive the usual warning, which would be provided by the Norwegian authorities. The Admiral Levchenko was underway as part of the Okean 24 naval exercise. These drills date back to the Cold War era and the latest iteration was claimed to be the biggest of its kind in 30 years. According to Russian accounts, over 400 warships and 120 aircraft were used, and China also participated. While the Okean 24 exercises are nothing new, it’s reported that these maneuvers are being run closer to Norway and now involve a greater degree of live firing than they did in the past, especially since Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The announcement of the incident also comes just a month after it was revealed that one of Norway’s most strategic air bases was the target of sabotage, earlier this year. According to reports, a critical communications cable associated with Evenes Air Station, in northern Norway, was severed in April and is now being investigated. Suspected sabotage against Air Force Base in Northern Norway. It was an intentional and calculated action, the Norwegian Police says about the damage to the cable that belongs to the Evenes Air Station The Barents Observer (@BarentsNews) August 23, 2024 The incident at Evenes was announced amid increasing warnings about nefarious Russian activity in Europe, part of an apparent wave of ‘hybrid warfare’ as the conflict in Ukraine further stokes East-West tensions. With its strategic position in the far north of Europe, Norway, a NATO member, is very much on the front line of some of these tensions. The country has previously also had encounters with the Russian military. Back in 2018, the Norwegian Intelligence Service (NIS) disclosed three separate instances where Russian aircraft had flown mock attack profiles against a secretive radar station in the northern part of the country. The year before that, the NIS blamed Russian jamming for disruptions in cell phone and GPS service in the region, though it said this was a byproduct of an exercise and not a deliberate attack.

Michael Narten/Picture-Alliance/DPA via AP Norway’s geopolitical significance has been recognized by the U.S. military as it intensifies its focus on the strategically important Arctic region. This has included the deployment of U.S. Air Force bombers to Norway, which happened for the first time in 2021, as you can read about here. As part of its 2020 Arctic Strategy, the U.S. Air Force is looking to bolster its presence in the region to counter the threat posed by Russia. The wider region has been identified as a potential flashpoint, as climate change sees a scramble to secure the potential wealth offered by natural resources, as well as new maritime trade routes that are no longer constrained by year-round sea ice. A U.S. Air Force B-1B bomber accompanied by Royal Norwegian Air Force F-35A fighters during a Bomber Task Force deployment. Norwegian Armed Forces For Russia, the region is also home to its largest and most important naval force, the Northern Fleet, which includes the majority of the country’s nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines. Exercises like Okean 24 also practice defending Russian nuclear submarines, ensuring they can leave their ports and go on patrol as a critical part of the country’s strategic deterrent. This factor has been reflected in generally increased Russian submarine activity in the Barents Sea and the Arctic region, as well as the Atlantic, in recent years. In 2020, the U.S. Navy took the unusual step of releasing a number of pictures of its nuclear attack submarine USS Seawolf, which surfaced in a fjord near Tromsø, Norway, for what was at the time a very rare public appearance in Scandinavia. USS Seawolf on the surface in a fjord near Tromsø, Norway on August 21, 2020. U.S. Navy For its part, Russia established a new Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command in 2014, which is responsible for the Arctic, North Atlantic, and Scandinavian regions. It includes the Northern Fleet, assets of which are concentrated on the Kola Peninsula, as well as military garrisons, and airbases. Moscow has also been using increasingly bold rhetoric when it comes to the Arctic. Just last week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned that 'the Arctic is not the territory of the North Atlantic alliance' and that Moscow was 'fully ready to defend its interests' there.

Satellite Images Show Massive Devastation At Russian Ammo Storage...	New satellite imagery shared with The War Zone shows just how badly three ammunition storage sites in Russia were damaged in recent Ukrainian drone attacks. The strikes, against the Toropets and Oktyabrsk facilities west of Moscow and Tikhoretsk in southern Russia, resulted in tens of thousands of tons of ammunition - including North Korean missiles - being destroyed, Ukrainian and Estonian authorities said. Ukrainian officials acknowledged Tikhoretsk and Okyabrsk were attacked on Sept. 21 while Toropets was hit on Sept. 18. Tikhoretsk is located in the Krasnodar region, about 220 miles from the front lines. According to the U.S. Mission to the UN, the White House determined that it was one of the storage facilities for ballistic missiles provided by North Korea. You can see a video of that attack below.

'Prior to 2023, the Tikhoretsk Munitions Storage Facility, sometimes reported to be the 719th Artillery Munitions Base&#8230;has been primarily concerned with the storage and maintenance of artillery munitions, artillery systems, and related equipment. The facility is secured with a multiple-layer security fence with guard towers, encompasses approximately 2.6 km2, and is served by a rail spur line from the small rail facility at Tikhon’kii (Tikhon’kiy), 3 km to the north.' The images below, taken Sept. 14 and provided by Maxar Technologies, show what Tikhoretsk looked like before the drone attack. Russia's Tikhoretsk ammunition storage facility as seen on Sept. 14. (Satellite image ©2024 Maxar Technologies) Images captured on Sept. 22, a day after the attack, show extensive damage. Scores of storage facilities appear to be destroyed or badly damaged and scorch marks cover a wide swath of the 2.6 square kilometer facility. The Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff said on its Facebook page that there were more than 2,000 tons of ammunition, including North Korean missiles, stored at Tikhoretsk. In addition, a Podlet radar station, which monitored aerial targets in the direction of the arsenal, was hit during the operation, according to the General Staff. The site as seen following a Ukrainian drone attack.

Located 300 miles north of the border, Oktyabrsk is home to the 23rd Artillery Arsenal. According to CNN, it is 'allegedly used to store Iskander tactical missile systems and Tochka-U tactical missile systems.'

How badly this will hurt its 'Special Military Operation' remains to be seen, but they show that Ukraine's long-range drone attacks continue to help offset Russia's advantages in the amount of troops and war materiel they have. The strikes on the ammunition storage area also came ahead of Ukrainian President Voldoymry Zelensky's visit to the U.S. this week, where he said he will present his Victory Plan to President Joe Biden as well as candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Among other things, the plan is said to include yet another appeal for the U.S. to end restrictions on the use of donated weapons deep into Russia. If that does not happen, Ukraine will have to continue to rely on its homegrown weapons to hit targets like those above. But while smaller drones rely on careful targeting to trigger a chain reaction of secondary explosions, the missiles the U.S. and its allies have provided can puncture even highly hardened storage areas, making totally devastating ammunition storage sites all that much easier.

All Three Chinese Aircraft Carriers Were At Sea For The First Tim...	In the latest expression of China’s rapidly growing and modernizing naval power, the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) recently, and for the first time, put three aircraft carriers to sea simultaneously. Of the three carriers involved in these activities, the Liaoning and the Shandong are by now well established with the Chinese fleet, while the Fujian, the country’s first domestically produced carrier, is still preparing for operational service. Ultimately, it’s expected to lead to more Chinese-made flattops as the PLAN continues to expand its naval aviation capabilities. Publicly available data, collated below by journalist Ian Ellis, indicates that, as of last week, the Liaoning and its carrier group were operating in the Philippine Sea, with the Shandong and its carrier group just off Hainan Island. Meanwhile, the Fujian had already left Jiangnan shipyard in Shanghai for another round of sea trials, with satellite imagery confirming that the three carriers were all sailing as of September 18. The carrier groups for the first two flattops each include at least four destroyers as well as a combat support vessel or frigate, very likely also accompanied by a hunter-killer submarine. A monumental milestone — for the first time in its 97-year history, three PLA Navy aircraft carriers were underway at the same timeChina has deployed both operational carriers to the Western Pacific this summer (three times in three months)Here’s everything you need to know: pic.twitter.com/3gTKgnU2s5&mdash; Ian Ellis (@ianellisjones) September 23, 2024 Since returning from its 2nd WESTPAC deployment in August, Shandong has been in & out of port a few times.

As of today, the Fujian — China’s first carrier to be fully locally designed and also the first intended to launch aircraft via catapults rather than by a ‘ski jump’ takeoff ramp — was apparently back in port in Shanghai, having completed its fourth at-sea trial. The PLANS-18 'Fujian' back on its pier after its fourth sea trial. (Image via @北冥有鱼MK6 from Weibo) pic.twitter.com/VSzUXzY5wc&mdash; @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) September 23, 2024 Overall, and even accounting for the fact that the Fujian has yet to be commissioned, these deployments provide a powerful indication of the PLAN’s growing presence and capabilities, especially regarding its carrier force. It should also be noted that China’s two operational aircraft carriers have been at sea simultaneously before, but this is now becoming much more routine — with three such dual-carrier deployments over three months this summer. Other aircraft carriers are also currently underway in the Indo-Pacific region, with the USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71) in the South China Sea as of late last week, having completed a deployment in the Middle East, as well as the Italian Navy aircraft carrier Cavour, a warship that you can read much more about here, and which recently conducted maneuvers with the U.S. and Australian armed forces. The Italian Navy aircraft carrier ITS Cavour during multinational task group activities in the Indo-Pacific region. Australian Department of Defense LSIS Daniel Goodman Beijing claims almost all of the highly strategic South China Sea, resulting in numerous disputes and standoffs. Recently, there have been multiple confrontations there involving China and the Philippines, including reports of Chinese Coast Guard vessels firing water cannons, blocking, and ramming Philippine vessels. Having the Liaoning and its carrier group here sends a powerful message to all the countries with stakes in this contested area. Last week, the Liaoning and accompanying ships were also noted sailing in waters off the east coast of Taiwan, that country’s defense ministry confirmed. The same carrier then passed through a narrow waterway between the Yonaguni and Iriomote islands in Japan’s Okinawa Prefecture, for the first time, according to the Japanese Ministry of Defense. :#BreakingNews‌China's Navy aircraft carrier temporarily enters Japan's contiguous waters.'In the early hours on Wednesday, aircraft carrier Liaoning sailed between Yonaguni Island and Iriomote Island in Okinawa Prefecture,temporarily entering Japan's contiguous waters.' pic.twitter.com/TxBpkrRYvQ&mdash; OSINT Expert (@OsintExperts) September 19, 2024 The ability to deploy carriers east of Taiwan gives the PLA another option for persistently striking at the island from that vector while also occupying a blocking position against U.S. or other foreign military forces heading west. Chinese naval and air activity has increasingly focused on the less heavily defended eastern side of Taiwan in recent years. Since the summer and the election of a new Taiwanese president, the PLAN has been ramping up its activities around Taiwan, with yet another spike in Chinese naval activities around the island, which Beijing views as a breakaway province. Other Taiwan-related drills earlier this month have included an amphibious landing exercise on China’s southeast coast opposite the island, which was said to be the largest of its kind so far. Notably, Taiwan has recently warned that China’s intense military activity makes it much harder to assess whether or not the People’s Liberation Army is about to launch a military campaign — for example, if it were about to attempt an invasion of Taiwan or encircle it, something that the Chinese military has repeatedly practiced, as you can read about here. Taiwanese soldiers stage an attack during an annual drill at a military base in the eastern city of Hualien. Photo by Mandy CHENG / AFP MANDY CHENG Taiwan’s Minister of Defense Wellington Koo last week pointed to China’s military activity getting 'larger and larger' with the effect that the island would have less time to respond were Beijing to actually go on the offensive, something that U.S. and other officials have suggested could happen around 2027. Koo said Taiwan needed to improve its ability to respond to 'a potential sudden contingency' and that the island’s reaction time 'cannot be as long as we would have imagined in the past.' 'We have to think about how we differentiate between peacetime and wartime,' Koo told reporters. 'The scale of [China’s military] activity is getting larger and larger, and so it is harder to discern when they might be shifting from training to a large exercise, and from an exercise to war.' Transitioning from a large-scale exercise to a military operation is hardly a new proposition, but there’s no doubt that China’s armed forces are expanding the scope and the complexity of their maneuvers, with the maritime component being very much at the forefront. The PLAN’s growing carrier force is becoming an increasingly important tool for a wide range of possible contingencies. In the Sea of Japan, meanwhile, where a PLAN surface action group is currently underway, recent incidents have included the reported violation of Japanese airspace by a Chinese surveillance aircraft, in what Tokyo said was a first-of-its-kind incident. The reported incursion took place late last month and you can read about it here. The PLAN has also recently been involved in large-scale military exercises with the Russian Navy.

The carrier activities further reinforce the already clear indications that the PLAN views its growing carrier force as a broader tool for projecting power further and further beyond China’s borders. This includes the critical First Island Chain, the boundary that is defined by archipelagos opposite mainland East Asia extending from the southern end of the Japanese home islands all the way to the South China Sea, and the Second Island Chain, which includes Guam and other U.S. island territories in the Marianas, extending further out into the Western Pacific. The PLAN’s carrier operations are now one of the most visible indicators of how the force is continuing to develop from a regional force that was primarily focused on operations in the First Island Chain to one that can also conduct operations out into the Second Island Chain and also more globally. As well as the carriers themselves, China is busy working on new and more capable aircraft from which to operate from them. These include the navalized version of the FC-31/J-35 stealth fighter, the KJ-600 airborne early warning and control plane, various drones, like the GJ-11 Sharp Sword unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV), plus helicopters. One of the first prototypes of the carrier-based J-35 stealth fighter. via Chinese internet The navalized J-35 — this time not a mockup. Chinese internet Ultimately, these aircraft and others are expected to be assigned to even more advanced carrier designs, the next of which is generally referred to as the Type 004. There have been persistent reports that this vessel could be nuclear-powered, which would give it effectively unlimited range and help meet the power-generation demands of ever-improving sensors, other mission systems, and possibly directed-energy weapons. An artist's concept of a future Chinese aircraft carrier. Chinese internet via @HenriKenhmann Already, China has demonstrated it can have two operational carriers at sea simultaneously, but once the Fujian is commissioned, dual-carrier operations should become much more routine, with the option to have two flattops deployed and another in post-deployment maintenance or refit, for example. More realistically, during peacetime, it will provide for one at sea, one working up for a deployment, and another undergoing maintenance or refit. Reports from state-run Chinese media have suggested that the Fujian could be commissioned into service in 2025, but more sober analysis suggests this will likely not happen until 2026. While not strictly aircraft carriers, it’s worth recalling that China is also scheduled to receive a number of very large big-deck amphibious assault ships, referred to as the Type 076. Each will feature at least one electromagnetic catapult that is expected to be primarily used to launch drones, as you can read more about here. While the PLAN’s carrier force, even including the Fujian, is still clearly outmatched by the U.S. Navy’s fleet of 11 active nuclear-powered supercarriers, China is already benefiting from having multiple carriers to draw on, and this advantage is set to become more pronounced in the years to come.

Aggressor F-16 Fleet Set To Be Slashed By Air Force	The U.S. Air Force is set to significantly cut back the number of F-16 Viper aggressor jets at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, including those flown by a squadron that stood up in a high profile manner just last year. This comes despite a surge in demand for 'red air' adversary support training and test and evaluation activities and raises broader questions about the future of the service's steadily aging F-16 fleet. Lt. Gen. John Healy, who serves as both Chief of the Air Force Reserve within the Air Force's top headquarters at the Pentagon and head of Air Force Reserve Command at Robins Air Force Base in Georgia, provided an update on the aggressor force at Nellis on the sidelines of the Air & Space Forces Association's (AFA) main annual conference last week. Nellis is currently home to three dedicated aggressor units, the active duty 64th and 65th Aggressor Squadrons and the Air Force Reserve's 706th Aggressor Squadron. The 706th was formally activated last year, transitioning from its previous role as a non-flying unit managing reserve pilots assigned to the United States Air Force Warfare Center (USAFWC), as you can read more about here. The 64th and 706th also fly F-16 variants, while the 65th has F-35A Joint Strike Fighters. F-16Cs assigned to the 706th Aggressor Squadron support Exercise Bamboo Eagle 24-3 in August 2024. USAF 'So, our F-16 aggressors at Nellis&#8230; the program record currently has them divesting 26. So there's no change to that right now,' Lt. Gen. Healy told The War Zone and others at a media roundtable on September 17. 'So. as we're currently moving forward, the expectation is that we will divest the pre-Block F-16 aggressors, and we have new mission sets at Nellis that we will be able to do and should be able to utilize that manpower to build as we continue to go forward.' The tail of an F-16 aggressor belonging to the 64th Aggressor Squadron, but wearing the markings of the 926th Operations Group, the parent organization of what is now designated the 706th Aggressor Squadron, a ceremony marking the formal activation of the latter unit in 2023. USAF With regard to F-16s, 'pre-Block' refers to Block 30/32 and older C/D variants. For years now, the Air Force been pushing to divest all of its pre-Block F-16s in order to rationalize its Viper fleet around Block 40/42 C/Ds and newer Block 50/52 'post-Block' versions. 'We'll try to utilize them [the pre-Block F-16s from Nellis] for our other remaining pre-Block F-16 unit down in Homestead,' which will involve working 'to find out what's the best of the bunch to keep our most viable jets for [the] long term, Healy added last week. Homestead Air Reserve base in Florida is currently home to the 482nd Fighter Wing and its 93rd Fighter Squadron. It is unclear whether or not all of the 26 pre-Block F-16s that Lt. Gen. Healy said are now set to leave Nellis belong to the 706th Aggressor Squadron or if this includes ones assigned to the 64th Aggressor Squadron, as well. What this all might mean either way for the latter unit, including whether it might get additional newer jets to make up for the impending shortfall, is also not clear. The 64th has long operated a mix of Block 25 and 32 F-16s, but it has also received at least 11 post-Block versions in recent years, at least some of which are Block 40s. The Block 40s notably have different engines (General Electric F110-series) from the Block 25s and Block 32s (Pratt & Whitney F100-series), and different maintenance and logistics requirements, as a result. An F-16C assigned to the 64th Aggressor Squadron. USAF William Lewis There is already evidence that the aggressor changes at Nellis are set to impact more than just the reserve component. When the 706th started getting its first F-16s in September 2023, it was reported that the squadron was only set to get 18 Vipers in total. At least some of those jets appear to be Block 30s (also with General Electric F110-series engines) that came from the Air Force Reserve's 457th Fighter Squadron at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas, which has been in the process of converting to the F-35A in the past year or so. An F-16C wearing the 'TX' tail code of the 457th Fighter Squadron lands at Nellis Air Force Base in November 2023. Jamie Hunter The War Zone has reached out for more information about exactly what the Air Force's organic aggressor force at Nellis is expected to look like going forward and what broader implications this might have. As already noted, the plans to cut 26 F-16s from Nellis' aggressor community raises immediate questions about the Air Force's ability to provide organic red air support. Earlier this year, the active-duty 18th Aggressor Squadron at Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska also notably transitioned to a unique air defense unit, the 18th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, which you can read more about here. 'Alaska based forces will continue to support Air Force and Joint exercises in Alaska, including Red Flag-Alaska,' a spokesperson for the 354th Fighter Wing at Eielson told The War Zone in April when asked about how the change in the 18th's primary mission might lead to an aggressor capacity gap and what steps might be taken to mitigate that. An F-16C still wearing an aggressor-style camouflage scheme assigned to what is now the 18th Fighter Interceptor Squadron takes part in Red Flag-Alaska 24-3 in August 2024. USAF U.S. military demand for aerial aggressors has already grown in scope and scale in recent years. The Air Force is now pushing to further expand its slate of large force air combat exercises as part of an ongoing shift in focus to preparing for potential high-end conflicts, especially one in the Pacific against China. There has also been an explosion in demand for aggressor support for test and evaluation activity activities in recent years, particularly as the Air Force has been pushing ahead with its Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative and other modernization efforts. The Air Force, as well as the U.S. Navy, have and continue to make heavy use of contractor red air services to help bolster aggressor capacity. There has also been a clear desire in recent years to bolster the services' abilities to provide these capabilities organically, especially as privately-operated pre-fourth-generation aggressors become increasingly obsolete. There is a growing need for fourth and fifth-generation fighters to better replicate more advanced threats. With all this in mind, it is worth noting that in 2022, the Air Force abruptly decided not to renew a long-standing contract with private firm Draken to provide adversary air services at Nellis, specifically. The U.S. military has also been working to acquire of more capable semi-expendable and stealthy target drones to help expand capacity to replicate advanced crewed and uncrewed aerial threats during training and testing. For the Air Force, new advanced target drones are seen as critical given the dwindling supply of older F-16s to convert into QF-16 drones. More capable uncrewed aggressors, possibly derived from future Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) designs, could be part of the aggressor equation in the future, too. However, current domestic U.S. airspace restrictions mean that uncrewed platforms of any type are not really usable in large force exercises that extend beyond the boundaries of tightly controlled ranges. Speaking at the roundtable at the AFA conference last week, Lt. Gen. Healy alluded to larger aggressor capacity concerns. 'We put them there [the pre-Block F-16s for the 706th] with the hopes of expanding and continuing further,' Healy said. 'That hasn't come to pass.' As the Air Force's fighter, F-16s continue to be in high demand to support training and test and evaluation requirements, as well as for operational deployments. As of Fiscal Year 2023, the service had 841 F-16s of all types, with the number expected to drop to 830 by the close of this fiscal cycle, which ends next Monday. Around 608 of the remaining jets are set to receive a slate of significant upgrades, including new active electronically-scanned array (AESA) radars and improved electronic warfare suites, as you can learn more about here. Even so, questions have been emerging already about the sustainability of Air Force F-16s, even post-Block types that are also getting ever older. These challenges have only become more pronounced as the Air Force has steadily walked back its expectation that the F-35, a program staring down ballooning sustainment costs and other issues, will completely supplant the Viper any time soon. In March, the Air Force also warned that hundreds of aircraft, including Vipers and other types, could end up grounded without an additional $1.5 billion for spare parts on top of its formal budget request for the 2025 Fiscal Year. The possibility of the Air Force buying new production Block 70/72 F-16C/Ds to bolster its tactical aviation fleets in the near term has come in the past. A Block 70 F-16C for the Royal Bahrani Air Force undergoing flight testing. USAF 'I am not tracking [that]. I don't have any information for you [on] that. There could be and I just don't know, or [there] may not be,' Maj. Gen. Bryony Terrell, Special Assistant to the Director of the Air National Guard, said in response to a question from The War Zone at a separate roundtable on the sidelines of the AFA conference last week about whether there were any plans to even look into buying new-build Block 70/72 Vipers. The Air Force has also expressed interest in utilizing the T-7A Red Hawk trainers that it is in the process of acquiring in the aggressor role. The idea of a light fighter based on the T-7 has also been put forward. Unfortunately, the T-7 continues to be beset by delays, with the first of these jet trainers now not expected to enter service until 2028. The first pre-production T-7A arrives at Edwards Air Force Base in 2023. USAF The first pre-production T-7A lands at Edwards Air Force Base. USAF Uncertainty around the Air Force's plans to acquire a new crewed sixth-generation stealth combat jet, primarily as a replacement for the much more advanced by also aging F-22 Raptor fleet, has prompted renewed discussions about purchasing an alternative 'light' stealth fighter of some kind, as well. The service is now regularly warning about at best flat budgets in the coming years that could upend modernization efforts across the board. In the meantime, increasingly complex global threats from great power competitors China and, to a lesser degree, Russia only look set to grow. This has driven demand for higher-end aggressor support and, in turn, contributed to the major push for more organic red air adversary capacity, especially after the end of the Draken contract at Nellis. Now, despite the continued demand, the Air Force's aggressor forces look to be contracting again without a clear plan to make up for the resulting gap. No matter how the Air Force's force structure ultimately evolves, the existing Viper fleet, even with substantial upgrades, will never be able to last forever, either. The plans to significantly shrink the number of dedicated aggressor F-16s at Nellis, together with other questions about the future of the Air Force's aging F-16 fleet, could be signs now of trouble on the horizon for the Air Force's aging F-16 fleet as a whole.

Hezbollah Converted Soviet Tu-143 Jet Recon Drone Into Cruise Mis...	Hezbollah now appears to be using converted Soviet-era jet-powered reconnaissance drones as cruise missiles. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) on Monday released a video it claimed showed an airstrike several weeks ago on a home in south Lebanon containing what it calls a 'DR-3 cruise missile' about to be launched. The DR-3 is another name for the Soviet-era Russian-made Tu-143 Reys jet-powered reconnaissance drone. Ukraine pioneered the conversion of Tu-143s into long-range strike weapons fairly quickly after Russia's all-out invasion. While Hezbollah has a massive cache of missiles and rockets, this marks the first emergence of a converted Tu-143 into a quasi-land attack cruise missile in its arsenal. You can read more about Hezbollah’s weapons cache in our deep dive here. The IDF used a photo of a Tu-143 Reys jet-powered drone to illustrate what it says was a Hezbollah cruise missile it destroyed before launch. (IDF) The IDF also used a Tu-143 in its illustration of how it claims Hezbollah uses civilian structures to launch weapons. (IDF screencap) You can see a retired Ukrainian Tu-143 in the image below. A retired Ukrainian Tu-143 Reys displayed in Kyiv. The drone is 26 feet 5 inches long with a wingspan of 7 feet 4 inches. (VargaA/Wikimedia Commons) What's also of great interest is the video of the strike shows how the missile was hidden inside a home. The Tu-143 is runway independent and uses rocket assistance for launching from a rail on a trailer or launch vehicle. For recovery, it uses a parachute system, although that would not be necessary for a cruise missile conversion. Tu-143 launching from its mobile container launcher. (uncredited) 'Here we are exposing Hezbollah’s method of hiding a cruise missile inside a home,' IDF spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari explained. 'The terrorists create a designated opening for the missile launch. Here you can see how we identified the terrorists making an opening in the building that exposed the missile. In a precise strike, the IDF eliminated the terrorists and this missile launching infrastructure, shortly before the launch.' Israel used a weapon with man-in-the-loop control to strike the Tu-143, of which it has many varieties, from shorter-ranged Spike missiles to Spice guided bombs to Delilah cruise missiles. In this case it looks like the observation platform was the same as the weapon used in the attack, which would point to Harop loitering munition or similar. IDF Spokesman Rear Adm.

You can read more about that here. The following video was used by Hezbollah to back up that claim, though it remains unclear where or when it was taken. Imad 4: Hezbollah reveals its underground capabilities.Huge tunnels inside mountaintops, dozens of rocket launchers. pic.twitter.com/NKP0Ydl57E&mdash; Clash Report (@clashreport) August 16, 2024 The IDF did not say how many of these improvised cruise missiles may exist, whether they have already been used or from where they were procured. Russia had previously provided some to the Assad regime in Syria, which is also backed by Hezbollah benefactor Iran. Moreover, Tehran has supplied Moscow with ballistic missiles and drones as part of a burgeoning military relationship between the two nations. The Tu-143 would give Hezbollah an additional capability to hit targets as far south as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. The IDF said it has a range of 124 miles, which corresponds with our previous reporting, and can deliver a 600-pound warhead. That means it can reach further and hit harder than much of Hezbollah’s cache of at least 150,000 rockets. However, as we previously noted, there are some limitations to this conversion, not least of which is relatively poor accuracy, unless more significant upgrades have been made to their guidance systems. As we have reported several times, Ukraine has converted the drone into a strike weapon and has used them to attack targets inside Russia and Crimea. The Tu-143 was first seen in its converted form in June 2022, when one, believed to be Ukrainian, was shot down in western Russia, according to a local official. You can see images purporting to be Tu-143 wreckage in Russia in the following Tweet, which misidentified it as the similar Tu-141 Strizh. The governor of the Kursk Oblast has shared photos of what he claims is a downed Ukrainian Tu-141 Strizh. pic.twitter.com/EoNwXnUw58&mdash; Benjamin Pittet (@COUPSURE) June 29, 2022 Ukraine pioneered these conversions with another very similar converted jet-powered Soviet-era reconnaissance drone, the larger Tu-141 to attack Russian airfields. The Tu-141 has a reported range of more than 650 miles. That Ukraine was converting these drones into strike weapons was first discovered when a Tu-141 crashed in Croatia in March in 2022. It was a bizarre and still-unexplained incident that we reported on here. The Tu-141 in Croatia reportedly carried an explosive warhead. The strike on the DF-3 was part of an increasing campaign to degrade Hezbollah’s capabilities, the IDF said on Telegram Monday. 'Shortly, the IDF will engage in extensive, precise strikes, against terror targets which have been embedded widely throughout Lebanon,' Hagari said. 'We advise civilians from Lebanese villages located in and next to buildings and areas used by Hezbollah for military purposes, such as those used to store weapons, to immediately move out of harm's way for their own safety.' Lebanese officials claim more than 350 were killed and more than 1,240 were wounded in these attacks.

Smoke rises after an Israeli airstrike hit the Tyre, in southern Lebanon on September 19, 2024. (Photo by Stringer/Anadolu via Getty Images) Anadolu There is growing concern that what began as a surprise Hamas attack on Israel Oc. 7, 2023 could spin into a larger, regional conflict. Hezbollah began its latest campaign of missile, rocket, and drone attacks on Israel the following day and the two sides have been trading volleys on an almost daily basis since. Adding to recent tensions, last week Israel apparently orchestrated two days of coordinated explosions targeting thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah in Lebanon. You can read our reporting of the first wave of explosions here, and the second wave here. Hezbollah leaders have vowed revenge. Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s leader, threatened Israel with 'tough retribution and just punishment' and that this would happen 'where it expects it and where it does not.' A photo taken on September 18, 2024, in Beirut's southern suburbs, shows the remains of exploded pagers on display at an undisclosed location. Hundreds of pagers used by Hezbollah members exploded across Lebanon on Sept. 17, killing at least nine people and wounding around 2,800 in blasts the Iran-backed militant group blamed on Israel. (Photo by AFP) - As a result of the increasing violence, The U.S. is sending more troops to the region in response, the Pentagon said Monday. The Pentagon's top spokesman, Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, provided no details on how many additional forces or what they would be tasked to do, The Associated Press reported. The U.S. currently has about 40,000 troops in the region, according to the wire service. 'In light of increased tension in the Middle East and out of an abundance of caution, we are sending a small number of additional U.S. military personnel forward to augment our forces that are already in the region,' Ryder said. 'But for operational security reasons, I’m not going to comment on or provide specifics.' 'On Monday, the aircraft carrier USS Truman, two destroyers, and a cruiser set sail from Norfolk, Virginia, headed to the Mediterranean on a regularly scheduled deployment, opening the possibility that the U.S. could keep both the Truman and the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, which is in the Gulf of Oman, nearby in case further violence breaks out,' the AP explained. The extent of Hezbollah's converted jet drone arsenal remains unknown as does whether it has used these weapons. Unlike in Ukraine, no wreckage has yet been found. If anything else, this is another sign that some of the improvised long-range strike practices from Ukraine and proliferating elsewhere. If these Tu-143s came from Syria, for instance, it would make sense for Hezbollah to want to attempt to adapt them just as Ukraine did.

AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon To Equip Ukraine’s F-16s: Report	Ukraine will likely receive a number of AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) glide munitions in a new $375 million U.S. aid package next week, Politico reported. The unpowered air-to-ground weapon has a range of over 70 miles, depending on flight profile, so it can be launched from outside the range of most enemy’s air defense systems. JSOWs do not have the reach of air-launched cruise missiles like the U.K.-French Storm Shadow/Scalp-EG it has received, or the German Taurus KEPD 350 cruise missiles it has long coveted. They also aren't as capable, long-ranged, hard-hitting, or stealth as the AGM-158 JASSM cruise missiles Ukraine wants most for its F-16s. However, it still gives Ukraine a weapon that can fire from safer distances at Russian troop concentrations, air defenses, and other targets, and navigate around air defenses to get there. . A US Navy ordnance handler pushes a Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) across the flight deck of the USS Kitty Hawk. (Photo by LEILA GORCHEV / AFP) LEILA GORCHEV In a previous analysis of potential Ukrainian F-16 weapons, we described JSOW as the most likely new advanced weapon Ukraine would receive with its donated F-16 Vipers. You can read our complete report on what could be available for Ukraine's here. The analysis continued: '[JSOW] is very well suited for the unique combat environment in Ukraine. It can autonomously glide to its target from over 70 miles away when launched at altitude or over a dozen miles when launched at low altitude. It could be especially useful for target geolocated static/semi-static air defense systems and its imaging infrared sensor it uses for terminal homing is impervious to radio-frequency jamming. It has a very small signature, as well, making it that much harder for Russian air defenses to shoot down.' JSOW had been delivered in cluster and unitary warhead configurations, with the latter being the focus of production today. Zelensky is scheduled to visit Washington next week, where he will present his peace plan as well as appeal to the Biden administration to remove restrictions on the use of long-range weapons deep inside Russia. This package, also likely to include artillery ammunition, rockets and air defense missiles, will be the largest package the U.S. has sent Ukraine since May, Politico noted. It could be the last presidential drawdown of equipment before the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. Under authority granted by Congress, the U.S. pulls existing weapons from its stockpiles, and the money is meant to purchase replacement munitions and equipment. The Pentagon is working with Congress to roll the remaining $5.9 billion left in the presidential drawdown authority (PDA) over to the next fiscal year, spokesman Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said last week in a statement. No deal has been struck yet as lawmakers struggle to come up with a plan to avoid a government shutdown on Oct.1, which will occur if no stopgap funding measure is passed in time. NEW: In a first, US will likely send Ukraine the Joint Standoff Weapon for its F16s. It's a precision missile that can travel around 70 miles. It's part of a $375M aid package expected to be announced Monday. Paul McLeary (@paulmcleary) September 20, 2024 The Latest Russia lost up to three months' worth of ammunition during the massive Sept. 18 Ukrainian drone attack on a sprawling storage facility in the country’s west, an Estonian intelligence officer told reporters on Friday. Ukraine managed to hit the warehouse when part of the ammunition was not completely placed in the bunkers, and that set off a chain of explosions, Ants Kiviselg said, according to the Estonian ERR news outlet. You can see the first moments of the attack in a video posted on Twitter. Short video of the first moments of the attack on a Russian Toropets ammunition storage and the panic of local residents. pic.twitter.com/UBN13AL6kV&mdash; Special Kherson Cat (@bayraktar_1love) September 20, 2024 About '30,000 tons of ammunition exploded, that is, 750,000 shells,' he claimed. 'At the average rate of hostilities, Russia produces 10,000 shells per week. That’s a two- to three-month supply of ammunition.' 'We will see the consequences of this loss at the front in the coming weeks,' he added. The War Zone cannot independently verify Kiviselg's assessment. Toropets suffered widespread damage in the attack, though one analyst suggested the loss of ammunition was likely far less than the numbers posited by Kiviselg. I have counted more than 90 destroyed buildings at the base. In 2018, Russian state media reported that each 'storage facility' can hold 240 tons of ammunition. If every building was full that would be a loss of approx. 21,600 tons. The real number is likely significantly lower.&mdash; Kyle Glen (@KyleJGlen) September 20, 2024 Data collected by NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) showed that the facility was still smoldering days after the attack.

In addition, other accounts suggested that that guided bombs, artillery, and S-400 air defense missiles were also stored there. The head of Ukraine’s Center for Countering Disinformation, Andriy Kovalenko, said on Telegram that the facility in Toropets was also being used to store ballistic missiles supplied to Russia by North Korea. The facility was still spewing smoke a day after being attacked, according to this Maxar Technologies satellite image taken Wednesday. A huge explosion rocked the Tver region, in the west of Russia, with initial reports indicating that Ukrainian long-range attack drones targeted an ammunition depot there. Videos and pictures on social media from the scene show an initial explosion, with a very large fireball, followed by a significant visible shockwave, then several minutes’ worth of secondary explosions illuminating the night sky.(Satellite image ©2024 Maxar Technologies) Russia depends heavily on artillery barrages on the front lines and deep-strike missile attacks on Ukrainian cities to prosecute this war. While the Estonian claim of 750,000 artillery shells is certainly a huge number, Russia has received millions of rounds from North Korea. Pyongyang has also supplied Moscow with ballistic missiles, as has Iran, which has also delivered thousands of Shahed drones. Still, in a war where its troops are consistently overmatched in terms of artillery, facing three-quarters of a million fewer shells would be good news for Ukraine. On the battlefield, Ukrainian forces continued to push westward in its Kursk salient but neither side made confirmed advances, according to the latest assessment from the Institute for The Study of War (ISW). There is visual evidence that Ukraine tried to advance toward the town of Veseloe. That's located about five miles southwest of Glushkovo, a tactically important city on the Seim River. The idea is to try and create a pincer, catching thousands of Russian troops between Glushkovo and Tetkino, about 13 miles to the west. However, as the last video below shows, the Ukrainian advance came under heavy fire with several vehicles likely destroyed. Meanwhile, Russia pounded Ukrainian positions in Kursk with glide bombs.

Before his F-16 went down, Mes, who went by the call sign 'Moonfish,' shot down three Russian cruise missiles and a one-way attack drone, Ukrainian Air Force Command West said on Facebook at the time. 'One scenario floating among the Ukrainian defense community is that the F-16 flew inadvertently through a cloud of debris created by the successful intercept and destruction of one of the incoming Russian missiles,' Breaking Defense reported. 'These fragments of the destroyed missile may have caused damage to the engine and other parts of the aircraft, causing the F-16 to break apart and/or the death of the pilot before he could eject.' This version 'is emerging as one of the more plausible scenarios, due to past precedence,' the publication noted, citing Ukrainian defense industry executives. One of them told the outlet that 'earlier in the war we lost four other fighters to this same cause of airborne foreign objects disabling the aircraft.' A Ukrainian F-16 piloted by pilot Oleksii Mes allegedly crashed due to the impact of a downed Russian missile.

The -5F variant is optimized for air-to-air use, but the plan now appears to be using them as ground-attack jets, employing air-to-ground munitions that France has already been sending to Ukraine, such as the stealthy SCALP-EG cruise missile and the Hammer rocket-assisted precision-guided bomb.

AGM-154 Joint Stand-Off Weapon To Equip Ukraine’s F-16s: Report	Ukraine will likely receive a number of AGM-154 Joint Stand-Off Weapon (JSOW) glide munitions in a new $375 million U.S. aid package next week, Politico reported. The unpowered air-to-ground weapon has a range of over 70 miles, depending on flight profile, so it can be launched from outside the range of most enemy’s air defense systems. JSOWs do not have the reach of air-launched cruise missiles like the U.K.-French Storm Shadow/Scalp-EG it has received, or the German Taurus KEPD 350 cruise missiles it has long coveted. They also aren't as capable, long-ranged, hard-hitting, or stealth as the AGM-158 JASSM cruise missiles Ukraine wants most for its F-16s. However, it still gives Ukraine a weapon that can fire from safer distances at Russian troop concentrations, air defenses, and other targets, and navigate around air defenses to get there. . A US Navy ordnance handler pushes a Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) across the flight deck of the USS Kitty Hawk. (Photo by LEILA GORCHEV / AFP) LEILA GORCHEV In a previous analysis of potential Ukrainian F-16 weapons, we described JSOW as the most likely new advanced weapon Ukraine would receive with its donated F-16 Vipers. You can read our complete report on what could be available for Ukraine's here. The analysis continued: '[JSOW] is very well suited for the unique combat environment in Ukraine. It can autonomously glide to its target from over 70 miles away when launched at altitude or over a dozen miles when launched at low altitude. It could be especially useful for target geolocated static/semi-static air defense systems and its imaging infrared sensor it uses for terminal homing is impervious to radio-frequency jamming. It has a very small signature, as well, making it that much harder for Russian air defenses to shoot down.' JSOW had been delivered in cluster and unitary warhead configurations, with the latter being the focus of production today. Zelensky is scheduled to visit Washington next week, where he will present his peace plan as well as appeal to the Biden administration to remove restrictions on the use of long-range weapons deep inside Russia. This package, also likely to include artillery ammunition, rockets and air defense missiles, will be the largest package the U.S. has sent Ukraine since May, Politico noted. It could be the last presidential drawdown of equipment before the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. Under authority granted by Congress, the U.S. pulls existing weapons from its stockpiles, and the money is meant to purchase replacement munitions and equipment. The Pentagon is working with Congress to roll the remaining $5.9 billion left in the presidential drawdown authority (PDA) over to the next fiscal year, spokesman Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said last week in a statement. No deal has been struck yet as lawmakers struggle to come up with a plan to avoid a government shutdown on Oct.1, which will occur if no stopgap funding measure is passed in time. NEW: In a first, US will likely send Ukraine the Joint Standoff Weapon for its F16s. It's a precision missile that can travel around 70 miles. It's part of a $375M aid package expected to be announced Monday. Paul McLeary (@paulmcleary) September 20, 2024 The Latest Russia lost up to three months' worth of ammunition during the massive Sept. 18 Ukrainian drone attack on a sprawling storage facility in the country’s west, an Estonian intelligence officer told reporters on Friday. Ukraine managed to hit the warehouse when part of the ammunition was not completely placed in the bunkers, and that set off a chain of explosions, Ants Kiviselg said, according to the Estonian ERR news outlet. You can see the first moments of the attack in a video posted on Twitter. Short video of the first moments of the attack on a Russian Toropets ammunition storage and the panic of local residents. pic.twitter.com/UBN13AL6kV&mdash; Special Kherson Cat (@bayraktar_1love) September 20, 2024 About '30,000 tons of ammunition exploded, that is, 750,000 shells,' he claimed. 'At the average rate of hostilities, Russia produces 10,000 shells per week. That’s a two- to three-month supply of ammunition.' 'We will see the consequences of this loss at the front in the coming weeks,' he added. The War Zone cannot independently verify Kiviselg's assessment. Toropets suffered widespread damage in the attack, though one analyst suggested the loss of ammunition was likely far less than the numbers posited by Kiviselg. I have counted more than 90 destroyed buildings at the base. In 2018, Russian state media reported that each 'storage facility' can hold 240 tons of ammunition. If every building was full that would be a loss of approx. 21,600 tons. The real number is likely significantly lower.&mdash; Kyle Glen (@KyleJGlen) September 20, 2024 Data collected by NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) showed that the facility was still smoldering days after the attack.

In addition, other accounts suggested that that guided bombs, artillery, and S-400 air defense missiles were also stored there. The head of Ukraine’s Center for Countering Disinformation, Andriy Kovalenko, said on Telegram that the facility in Toropets was also being used to store ballistic missiles supplied to Russia by North Korea. The facility was still spewing smoke a day after being attacked, according to this Maxar Technologies satellite image taken Wednesday. A huge explosion rocked the Tver region, in the west of Russia, with initial reports indicating that Ukrainian long-range attack drones targeted an ammunition depot there. Videos and pictures on social media from the scene show an initial explosion, with a very large fireball, followed by a significant visible shockwave, then several minutes’ worth of secondary explosions illuminating the night sky.(Satellite image ©2024 Maxar Technologies) Russia depends heavily on artillery barrages on the front lines and deep-strike missile attacks on Ukrainian cities to prosecute this war. While the Estonian claim of 750,000 artillery shells is certainly a huge number, Russia has received millions of rounds from North Korea. Pyongyang has also supplied Moscow with ballistic missiles, as has Iran, which has also delivered thousands of Shahed drones. Still, in a war where its troops are consistently overmatched in terms of artillery, facing three-quarters of a million fewer shells would be good news for Ukraine. On the battlefield, Ukrainian forces continued to push westward in its Kursk salient but neither side made confirmed advances, according to the latest assessment from the Institute for The Study of War (ISW). There is visual evidence that Ukraine tried to advance toward the town of Veseloe. That's located about five miles southwest of Glushkovo, a tactically important city on the Seim River. The idea is to try and create a pincer, catching thousands of Russian troops between Glushkovo and Tetkino, about 13 miles to the west. However, as the last video below shows, the Ukrainian advance came under heavy fire with several vehicles likely destroyed. Meanwhile, Russia pounded Ukrainian positions in Kursk with glide bombs.

Before his F-16 went down, Mes, who went by the call sign 'Moonfish,' shot down three Russian cruise missiles and a one-way attack drone, Ukrainian Air Force Command West said on Facebook at the time. 'One scenario floating among the Ukrainian defense community is that the F-16 flew inadvertently through a cloud of debris created by the successful intercept and destruction of one of the incoming Russian missiles,' Breaking Defense reported. 'These fragments of the destroyed missile may have caused damage to the engine and other parts of the aircraft, causing the F-16 to break apart and/or the death of the pilot before he could eject.' This version 'is emerging as one of the more plausible scenarios, due to past precedence,' the publication noted, citing Ukrainian defense industry executives. One of them told the outlet that 'earlier in the war we lost four other fighters to this same cause of airborne foreign objects disabling the aircraft.' A Ukrainian F-16 piloted by pilot Oleksii Mes allegedly crashed due to the impact of a downed Russian missile.

The aircraft could be delivered with valuable new munitions, including versions of the MICA beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile. The -5F variant is optimized for air-to-air use, but the plan now appears to be using them as ground-attack jets, employing air-to-ground munitions that France has already been sending to Ukraine, such as the stealthy SCALP-EG cruise missile and the Hammer rocket-assisted precision-guided bomb.

What American Fighters And Their Drone Wingmen Fighting Chinese J...	Collins Aerospace has put forward a vision for what a high-end air combat engagement between the U.S. and Chinese armed forces, with the American side employing crewed fighters and Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drone wingmen, could look like in the future. A division of Raytheon (now formally known as RTX), Collins released the glitzy computer-generated video seen below last week primarily to showcase its work on autonomous capabilities that could support the U.S. Air Force's CCA program, as well as the U.S. Navy's separate, but closely related effort of the same name. The video opens with U.S. forces forming for the mission at hand. CCAs are showing taking off from a remote airstrip and an aircraft carrier. This highlights the potential for the drones to be launched from disparate operating locations and not necessarily ones tied to the basing of their crewed companions. The War Zone has noted in the past how drones with limited dependence on traditional runways, or even complete runaway independence, could be extremely valuable in future distributed operations. A notional CCA takes off from a remote airstrip. Collins Aerospace capture Two different kinds of notional CCAs are depicted. One that has some very general similarities to Anduril's Fury. The other looks very much in line with Kratos' XQ-58 Valkyrie. A CCA design that General Atomics is currently working on also has a broadly similar overall configuration with a top-mounted intake and v-tail. A screen capture showing the two types of notional CCAs in the Collins Aerospace video. Collins Aerospace capture Fury and General Atomics' CCA design are currently under development as part of the first phase of the Air Force's CCA program. The Air Force, as well as the U.S. Marine Corps, have also been flying XQ-58s to support work on autonomous capabilities, as well as other research and development and test and evaluation efforts.

General Atomics/Jamie Hunter A US Marine Corps XQ-58 Valkyrie. USAF Collins' video shows two-seat F-15E Strike Eagle derivatives, F/A-18F Super Hornets, and F-35 Joint Strike Fighters as the crewed controllers for the CCAs. Both the F-15s and F/A-18Fs are notably shown carrying podded infrared search and track (IRST) systems, as well as full air-to-air combat load-outs including AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) and AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles. US Navy F/A-18F Super Hornets carrying IRST pods, AIM-120s, and AIM-9Xs, flying together with CCAs. Collins Aerospace capture The F-15s depicted in the video are some of a hybrid of real-world variants. The jets are shown with additional outboard underwing pylons currently only found in U.S. Air Force service on the F-15EX Eagle II, but lack other key features on that version. The aircraft also have 'MO' tail codes indicating jets based at Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho, where F-15E Strike Eagles are based. There are no current plans to replace the F-15Es in Idaho with EXs. Collins Aerospace capture The War Zone has repeatedly highlighted how two-seat tactical jets like the F-15EX would be particularly well suited to serving as airborne drone controllers since the individual in the back seat could handle that mission while the pilot focuses on actual flying. Back-seaters in F-15s and F/A-18Fs are seen issuing instructions to their pilotless wingmen via touchscreen interfaces on tablet-like devices. The F-35 pilots are depicted using the same user interface via the wide-area display in their jets' cockpits. The user interface that is shown provides the ability to select multiple drones at once and to direct them to perform pre-set mission profiles – including transit, defensive counter air (DCA), and combat air patrol (CAP) – at least semi-autonomously. Depictions of a tablet-based touch-screen user interface for controlling drones, as well as one utilizing the F-35's wide-area cockpit display. Collins Aerospace capture In the video, the drones are ordered first to transit to a mission area before being switched over to the DCA mode. Doing this causes the CCAs to turn on their sensors and begin scanning, at which point various threats – a mix of Flanker variants and Chinese J-20 stealth fighters – are detected. A J-20 stealth fighter seen in the Collins video. Note that the aircraft depicted here is wearing fictional national markings, but that China's People's Liberation Army is the only one to currently operate this aircraft. Collins Aerospace capture A pair of Flanker-type fighters seen in the Collins video. China also operates multiple Flanker variants and derivatives. Collins Aerospace capture One of the most commonly cited benefits of groups of drones tethered to piloted fighters in air-to-air combat is the ability of the uncrewed component to extend the sensor reach of the entire force without necessarily increasing the risks to the crewed component. For instance, CCAs could employ active sensors and pass the information they gather along to piloted fighters operating their sensor suites in a passive mode making them harder to detect. Crewed combat jets could also potentially engage enemies based on that targeting data forwarded from drone wingmen. With additional networking connectivity, the data collected by the complete crewed-uncrewed team could be pushed to other nodes, as well. Text narration in the Collins' video highlights how a human-machine team could 'collaborative search the battlespace, detecting threats building shared understanding, triangulating to generate target tracks.' It's also worth noting here that one of the key benefits of the IRST systems that the F-15s and F/A-18Fs are depicted carrying in the Collins' video is that they function passively, which also does not alert opponents to the fact that they are being tracked. IRSTs, which be paired with other sensors to provide additional capabilities, are also immune to radiofrequency electronic warfare jamming. You can read more about the value of IRSTs, which are seeing a renaissance in the U.S. military, here. The video from Collins subsequently shows U.S. fighters and CCAs engaging and shooting down a number of Chinese jets. Interestingly, the footage does not appear to depict any direct authorization being given to the drones before they fire their missiles. U.S. military officials have stressed repeatedly that, at least for the foreseeable future, a human operator somewhere 'on-the-loop' will always be responsible for authorizing uncrewed platforms in the air or anywhere else to employ lethal force. A notional CCA about to launch its AIM-120s. Collins Aerospace capture After combat concludes, the video shows different groups of CCAs being directed to maintain CAPs or return to base (RTB). As seen below, the user interface at this point in the computer-generated footage also shows what looks to be options for handing off control of the drones from the fighters to other aircraft, as well as ships and forces on the ground, and even nodes in space. The Air Force and Navy are already known to be working on ways to be able to seamlessly exchange control of CCAs in future operations. There has been talk of expanding portions of that architecture out to other branches of the U.S. military, as well as to allies and partners. Collins Aerospace capture The scenario outlined in the Collins' video is, of course, notional and, in many ways, truncated. A high-end aerial combat mission like this would likely occur across a much broader area with actual engagements occurring at beyond visual range. Notably absent entirely in the footage are hostile uncrewed combat air vehicles (UCAV) and other drones, which the Chinese aviation sector is very actively developing. When it comes to stealthy highly-autonomous flying wing UCAV, in particular, this is a space the United States has all but completely ceded to China, at least publicly.

Yang Suping/VCG via Getty Images Yang Suping/VCG via Getty Images In the video, neither side is shown leveraging their still-growing arrays of offboard air and other assets that would be involved in any operation of this kind, either. U.S. military officials have routinely cited China's growing airborne early warning and control and aerial electronic warfare capabilities as being major expected factors in any future air-to-air engagement between the two countries. A Chinese Y-9LG standoff electronic warfare aircraft, a relatively new design that shares many characteristics with the country's KJ-200 airborne early warning and control aircraft. via X What Collins' has put out still presents an interesting outlook for what highly autonomous crewed-uncrewed teaming might look like in future high-end aerial combat. It also highlights questions about concepts of operations when it comes to executing these kinds of teamed air-to-air engagements, as well as basing and sustaining CCAs, that the Air Force, as well as the Navy, are still very much working to answer. The Air Force 'has talked about potentially having as many as 1,000 of these CCAs to use in a contingency,' Gen. Kenneth Wilsbach, head of Air Combat Command, said at a talk that the Air & Space Forces Association's Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies hosted earlier this year. 'And I think that’s a noble goal, and one that would create a lot of dilemmas as people think about getting into a fight with us and having to contend with that many, plus all of our manned platforms.' At the same time, 'you probably don’t need to fly that [CCA] aircraft every day,' Wilsbach continued. 'And in fact, what we think is that we’ll have these aircraft available to fly, but they won’t fly that often. And the benefit of that is you don’t need the maintenance. You don’t need the long-term sustainment, and so you get a lot more airframes for a given amount of money.' Wilsbach added at that time that the drones would likely be kept essentially in 'flyable storage' and 'in a hangar and they’ll be ready to fly' most of the time, only being brought out when necessary. You can read more about the benefits of an operational concept like this in this past War Zone feature. Collins Aerospace capture Exactly how CCAs will be controlled and what levels of autonomy may truly be available in the near term to support all of this still very much remains to be seen, as well. 'There's a lot of opinions amongst the Air Force about the right way to go [about controlling drones from other aircraft],' John Clark, Lockheed Martin Vice President and General Manager of Advanced Development Programs (ADP), better known as Skunk Works, told The War Zone and others at this year's Air & Space Forces Association's (AFA) Air, Space & Cyber Conference earlier this week. 'The universal thought, though, is that this [a tablet or other touch-based interface] may be the fastest way to begin experimentation. It may not be the end state.' 'We're working through a spectrum of options that are the minimum invasive opportunities, as well as something that's more organically equipped, where there's not even a tablet,' Clark added. Testing to date has exposed potential issues around using tablets and other touch interface systems. 'We started with [the Air Force’s] Air Combat Command with tablets… There was this idea that they wanted to have this discreet control,' Michael Atwood, Vice President of Advanced Programs for General Atomics, said during an appearance on The Merge podcast earlier this year. 'I got to fly in one of these jets with a tablet. And it was really hard to fly the airplane, let alone the weapon system of my primary airplane, and spatially and temporally think about this other thing.' At that time, Atwood advocated for ceding greater control to drones under human supervision. An example of an actual tablet-based drone control system General Atomics has experimented with in the past. GA-ASI 'We know two things about autonomy,' Andrew Hunter, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology & Logistics, told The War Zone and other outlets at a media roundtable on the sidelines of this week's AFA conference. 'One is laws of war require us to have, you know, human engagement in key decisions involving employment of weapons and other key decisions. So we have to have that. We have to have that human engagement, the ability to do that. The second is [that] we know that our ability to create systems that can operate autonomously and do missions well is something that is still maturing.' 'So, in other words, there are things that we know that we already know how to do well with autonomy, and there's things that we know we do not know how to do well with autonomy,' Hunter continued. 'So we're going to stick to the things we know we can do well, and then have humans do the other things, and, over time, that mix is going to change&#8230; it's not going to be static.' With the Air Force pushing hard to begin fielding its first operational CCAs by the end of the decade, it should become increasingly clear in the coming years how well Collins' vision does or doesn't align with reality.

Israeli Airstrikes In Lebanon Intensify	Israel has launched its most intense airstrikes on Lebanon since the start of the Gaza war almost a year ago. The raids, launched by Israeli Air Force (IAF) aircraft late on Thursday, and centered upon southern Lebanon and Beirut, follow the unprecedented series of explosions targeting electronic devices belonging to Hezbollah members in that country, earlier this week. Israel claims that a significant number of leading Hezbollah commanders were killed in an airstrike on Beirut today. As more members of the international community call upon both sides for restraint, Israel and Hezbollah appear closer to all-out war than they have been at any point in the last 12 months or so. People gather in front of a building targeted by an Israeli strike in Beirut's southern suburbs on September 20, 2024. The strike on Hezbollah's stronghold in Lebanon's capital Beirut reportedly killed at least eight people and wounded dozens of others, with a source close to the movement saying a top military leader was dead.

'In the new phase of the war, there are significant opportunities but also significant risks. Hezbollah feels that it is being persecuted and the sequence of military actions will continue,' he added. The airstrikes followed attacks earlier this week that have been widely attributed to Israel and which left 37 people dead and around 3,000 injured after explosives were triggered in Hezbollah pagers (on Tuesday) and walkie-talkies (Wednesday). Meanwhile, Hezbollah has launched over a hundred rockets against targets in Israel today. According to the Associated Press, around 140 rockets were fired from Lebanon across the border.

Hezbollah rockets began targeting Israel last October 8. The fighting in the border area has not escalated into full-scale war but has resulted in hundreds of deaths, most of them from Hezbollah, as well as Israeli civilians and soldiers. Furthermore, tens of thousands of people have been evacuated from the border area on both sides. 'Our goal is to ensure the safe return of Israel’s northern communities to their homes.

Nasrallah said Hezbollah hoped Israeli troops would enter southern Lebanon, providing the militant group with an 'historic opportunity' to take them on in battle. Israel will face 'a crushing response from the Axis of Resistance,' Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Commander Hossein Salami said yesterday, according to state media. Iran is the major military backer of Hezbollah, while the Axis of Resistance refers to other Iran-aligned militant groups including Hamas, the Houthis in Yemen, and various armed groups in Iraq and Syria. Today, the Iranian Embassy in Lebanon also directly condemned the airstrike in Beirut, describing it as 'Israeli madness and arrogance.'

A Peak Into The Future Of Offensive Electronic Warfare	Electronic warfare (EW) has taken on new prominence as the threat from near-peer adversaries has ballooned in recent. Who can best dominate the radio frequency spectrum and take the electronic fight directly to the enemy will have a massive advantage in tomorrow battles. To find out more about the state of play in offensive EW, we sat down with Chuck Angus, director of business development in Naval Power at Raytheon. He oversees the company's cutting-edge offensive electronic warfare (EW) portfolio. Angus talked with The War Zone about the latest in offensive EW, his company's new AN/ALQ-249(V)1 Next Generation Jammer-Mid Band (NGJ-MB) electronic warfare pods (currently installed on EA-18G Growlers aboard the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln) and the applicability of such systems on sixth-generation fighters and loyal wingman drones. This conversation, which took place on the sidelines of the Air & Space Forces Air, Space & Cyber conference in National Harbor, Maryland, has been slightly edited for clarity. The AN/ALQ-249(V)1 Next Generation Jammer-Mid Band (NGJ-MB). (Raytheon) Q: Talk about how electronically scanned array (AESA) antennas like those on the NGJ will improve offensive EW. A: What’s interesting is that AESA arrays can do lots of things differently than some of the steerable arrays that we had. So essentially, the AESAs, based on their field of regard, can do a lot of things in a lot of places simultaneously, and so you think about electronic attack systems like NGJ, where we've got eight AESA arrays from that, for those, for that shipset, from those two pods. And it can do a lot of things for a large breadth of area. An exploded view of the components inside Raytheon’s NGJ-MB pod. (USN) If we talk about electronic attack per se, the way those arrays are set up, the way it was designed, is that, is that I can attack an adversary out the front and the side, and then as I'm ingressing. Once I egress, that system, working together, can move those assignments from one set of arrays, from the front to the back, from the left pod to the right pod. The point of it is, is that when you have that multifunctioning array, and you have some autonomy that goes with it, you can move those assignments or jobs or whatever it's going to be doing, whether it's comms or delivering payloads or whatever it is, it can do it around that platform, even while it's making a turn. So I think it's really, really important. And fire control radar, is the same way, right? So now you got a fire control radar, and you've got a sensor and stuff, and if you get them all fused together, I think that that's a very valuable contribution. (You can read all about what multi-function AESA arrays distributed around an aircraft are capable of in this past special feature of ours.) NAVAIR Q: What kind of effects can next-generation EW have on adversary systems? Can it destroy radar seekers on incoming missiles, for instance? A; I'll talk about offensive electronic attack, because that's distinguishing it from self-protect, right? So as an example, what you're really trying to do is protect a protected entity with another entity. So, as an example, a Growler flying in formation with a [F/A-18] Super Hornet, right? The Growler is not protecting itself. That's not what it's about. It's protecting the Super Hornets flying out in front of it. And so it's protecting that Super Hornet by denying that adversary radar from detecting it so it can drive in closer and drop its weapons right again when you ingress and egress, you can stay on that target at the same time. So not only is it reducing the detection range of a platform that's dropping weapons, it's also protecting that platform against an air-to-air threat. So maybe it's a Chinese fighter or a Russian fighter. If you can reduce that fighter's ability to see you, you get a chance to shoot first. Great combat advantage. The other thing, I think it's really important, is when we talk about magazine depth, and everybody's interested in 'how many weapons do I have?' So again, if you can reduce that adversary radar from seeing that weapon that’s inbound until it gets really, really close, then you're going to improve that capability to attack that target, support those weapons all the way to target, reducing the amount of weapons you have to fire, right? And, by definition, increasing your magazine depth. A VAQ-133 EA-18G with NGJ-MB pods lands on board the USS Abraham Lincoln. (USN ) Q: Can it affect inbound air-to-air missiles? A: I probably can't talk much about that. I'll say it this way, if a weapon was using a radar and you had the ability to affect a radar, I could imagine that there may be some effect. Q: What about distributing EW to platforms across the battlespace and connecting them for cooperative EW via networking? How far along is this and what are the advantages? A: Certainly a lot of advantages. And I think the advantages, besides the fact that the guy over here can send an assignment hundreds of miles away, and get something done over there, that's an incredible advantage. I think the ability to team them together on a specific target would also be an advantage. One of the things that we talk about in electronic attack is the ability to do simultaneous targets, multiple simultaneous targets, with multiple techniques. So the ability to attack this target while the same time attacking another target from the same AESA array that you've that you've divided. That’s the idea behind the AEASs. You don't have to turn it. You can divide it and split that beam. So not only can you attack multiple simultaneous targets, but you can also move from one to the other really, really quick. And I think that's one of the great benefits of something like an electronic attack that you can move quickly so sometimes that threat radar may not even know that you've left it and gone to something else. So imagine multiplying that capability across the board. It doesn't have to be a small platform. It can be much larger platforms. It can be multiple types of aircraft, bombers, fighters, maritime patrol, UAS, and mobility aircraft, right? That whole thing can enable that joint fight. And it's not just about the capability, it's about the capacity. That was your point. Your point was, ‘how can I increase the capacity?’ Then working together. That's what you're doing. You're increasing the capacity. A graphic giving a very general look at different jamming mission profiles, with the EA-18G seen here providing so-called 'modified escort jamming' from outside the range of enemy ground-based air defenses. The NGJ-MB pods are capable of supporting other profiles, as well. (GAO) Q: Are you looking at cognitive electronic warfare on this? A: ​​So that's important, and we have been looking at it, but I can't really discuss the work that's going on. Q: What can EW do as far as making things appear to the enemy that are not there? A: So the nice thing about having a software-defined radio is that any equation that can be built in MATLAB [a programming platform designed specifically for engineers and scientists to analyze and design systems and products], you can project. So you can imagine that you could do a lot of things with RF energy. I can't talk about some other things that it can go do. But certainly, there are a lot of effects that you can do with AESA arrays and different techniques. Q: What do you think EW will look like on a Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) sixth-gen fighter or a collaborative combat aircraft (CCA)? A: Well, I understand that there are still some requirements generation going on about what those missions are, but it's clear to me that electronic attack is an enabler. It has to have a position as part of that, right? Is it high-powered? That's a great question. It probably depends on the platform. Right? Is it going to be very directed, is it going to be attritable? Because it’s a question about what that solution is. Could it be carried in a pod? It could be carried in a pod. It would be a small pod, but I still think you have to have power generation capability, because some of these platforms are maybe power starved anyway. A model of General Atomics’ CCA design on display at the AFA conference this week. Jamie Hunter Q: That sounds like a difficult challenge. A: It is a difficult challenge and that's why you see something like an NGJ, which has its own power system. Because once it's airborne, it doesn't need any power from the airplane. It has its own. NGJ has a ram air turbine generator. It has doors on both sides that open up when it's airborne, and it takes the air through those doors, turns a turbine and generates 82 kW. Q: Would some version of the NGJ fit in a CCA at some point? Is it something you're considering looking at? A: I think the market is heading towards smaller form factor, as you're describing. So I think there's opportunity there. Q: Is that something you are actually pursuing? A: We've been investing in a smaller form factor. I can't just tell you who've been working with on it, but you know, NGJ is 14 feet, 1,200 pounds. Depending on the size of the platform, you may have to have something smaller. (Raytheon) Q: Can you talk about what kind of platform? Crewed? Uncrewed? A: I think both, there's no reason why you couldn't do it. NGJ in itself is pretty autonomous, especially if you've done the mission plan. A lot of those assignments are mission-planned, so you really don't need any operator intervention. And we don't talk about managing the assignments anymore. It's not like the guy in the back is [doing] pushing-the-buttons kind of stuff. What we're doing is managing the priorities of those assignments. So if it's that radar you want to go after, that's a higher priority than this other one. So mission-plan the priority of those assignments, and It'll prosecute those targets autonomously. Q: Has NGJ achieved initial operational capability (IOC) yet? A: You'll have to talk to the Navy about IOC and deployment. What I can tell you is that we're delivering pods to the Navy. Operational testing has gone extremely well. Q: When was the operational test? A: Well, I think there's still some pieces of it ongoing. But performance has been very, very good. Q: Have you gotten any feedback or lessons learned from that [deployment on an operational cruise]? A: Just like any new weapon system, I think when you put it in the hands of the operator, you learn something because those guys are smarter than you and I both. And they find new ways to use things. I think every day we learn something from operational tests, developmental tests, because the guys are actually putting it through its paces. Q: But have you gotten any feedback from the Lincoln, which arrived with the pods in the U.S. Central Command region last month? A: I can't tell you what they're doing operationally and where they are. What I can tell you is that we have field service representatives who support the squadrons. And we get feedback. A VAQ-133 Growler assigned to the USS Abraham Lincoln with AN/ALQ-249(V)1 Next Generation Jammer-Mid Band (NGJ-MB) pods under its wings. (USN) Q: Has anything that's happened on Lincoln come back to you to figure out how to make things better? A: We get all kinds of feedback from the Navy. Okay? I just can't describe where it is. So I think what you're starting to hear around is that everybody loves the Growler and NGJ. But there are only so many Growlers and so many NGJs, right? You can put this on the non-traditional EW platforms, the bombers, the fighters, maritime patrol, UAS… Q: Tankers? A: Tankers. You can put it on those, and you can automatically increase the EA capacity in the fight. And the other thing, and I'll mention quickly, is that if you put it on a bomber whose primary mission is to shoot weapons, that's what they're there for, they're going to drop weapons. So that non-kinetic effect of electronic attack is an enabler…it increases the capability of that kinetic effect, right? It's really interesting working them together like that, and it's something we hadn't talked about. And again, increasing the magazine depth. Q: Where are the adversaries like China and Russia on offensive EW? Can you say what you might be learning from them? A: I think we learn from them every day. And then some things we learned that maybe we've known, and some things that we probably didn't understand at the time, but I think it's a very interesting threat landscape right now. And my belief is that electronic attack is one of those disruptive technologies and capabilities that's really needed to prosecute the war, whether it's in the South China Sea, or there's [U.S. European Command] EUCOM and support with NATO wherever. I think it's an incredible enabler. Revolutionary change. Q: How would you rate China’s capabilities in terms of offensive EW? For instance, its Y-9LG electronic warfare aircraft recently took part in military drills with Thailand. A: I don’t think there's anything like what we have in the inventory. But clearly they have - like everybody else - they've moved the ball rather quickly on EW. Everybody has because technology is getting better. So they're not doing the scanning antennas anymore, right? They're doing something different. They're using GaN [Gallium Nitride] in places, right? So I think it's really, really important. It is believed that China's Y-9LG jammer aircraft uses its powerful electronically scanned radar beams to suppress enemy radar signals. (Via Twitter) via X Q: How about the Russians? Can you assess their offensive EW capabilities? A: I really can't, I can just tell you that, just like the Chinese - and everybody - they’ve advanced their EW capabilities. Q: This is an Air Force trade show. Talk about how putting NGJ on Navy Growlers helps the Air Force. A: The [non-recurring engineering] NRE [cost] is done for NGJ, essentially, right? The DoD spent $3 billion, probably a little more than that, over all the NRE. So a service or a country could essentially pick that system up as it is and be able to use it. You'll need to do some integration, that kind of stuff. But certainly, all the heavy lifting has been done. So there's opportunity there, and of course, you drive the cost down. The other piece that we're investing in, and the Navy's investing in, is our production facility in Forest, Mississippi, where we're now increasing the capability to test faster, to develop faster, and to produce it quicker. End of interview. Despite its importance, EW overall hasn't historically received the budgetary support some U.S. military leaders say it deserves, a point Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall drove home during his keynote speech at the AFA conference. 'We started looking closely at electronic warfare for several reasons,' he said. 'First of all, we thought it was a key enabler in almost every one of our operating barriers. Second, most of our electronic warfare programs are platform-centered, so there was a unifying focus on this area as a whole. My own experience suggested that this is a historically neglected area that can be that can have an oversized impact, but doesn't compete well with our internal budget values relative to other priorities. We established cross-cutting operational neighborhood structure in this area try to bring more focused and conscious consideration to electronic warfare.' Whether Kendall can match his support for robust EW with commensurate funding is something we will watch closely. There has been growing chatter about the F-15EX getting Next Generation Jamming pods to tie into its extremely advanced electronic warfare system, but that hasn't been formalized at this time. There are significant investments being made in the new EQ-37 Compass Call fleet as well as updating the electronic warfare systems on existing fighters. The biggest leap may come with the F-35 Block IV, which will have an EW system that is touted as the most important aspect of the Block IV upgrade. All these elements and more could contribute to a new distributed EW strategy for the USAF that will only be bolstered by CCAs, new air-launched effects weapons and aircraft like the NGAD fighter and B-21 Raider. Clearly other developments are also happening in the classified realm. But considering the threat posed by China and Russia's own growing EW capabilities, more funds flowing toward controlling the radio frequency spectrum are more likely than not.

Collaborative Combat Aircraft Program 'Ingesting' Modular Chassis...	The U.S. Air Force says the once-secretive Off-Board Sensing Station (OBSS) drone program has been fully folded into the service's Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) effort. General Atomics has already disclosed that its current CCA design is derived from the XQ-67 drone it developed for OBSS. The Air Force and General Atomics have done pioneering work on the idea of accelerating the development and production of different kinds of drones by using a common core 'chassis' that includes landing gear and critical mission and flight control computer systems through OBSS. It is now hoped that these concepts will be beneficial to future tranches of CCAs. The XQ-67A during its first flight on February 28, 2024. Courtesy photo via USAF Air Force officials offered new details about the relationship between the OBSS and CCA programs, as well as the earlier Low Cost Attritable Aircraft Platform Sharing (LCAAPS) effort, at the Air & Space Forces Association's (AFA) main annual conference just outside of Washington, D.C., earlier this week. A model of General Atomics' CCA design on display at the AFA conference this week. Jamie Hunter '[Speaking] from the [Air Force] Test Center [AFTC] perspective, but also having some experience with the Lab [the Air Force Research Laboratory; AFRL], we went through a long process of developing that technology,' Air Force Maj. Gen. Scott Cain told The War Zone and others at a media roundtable on the sidelines of the AFA conference yesterday. 'Our steps that we took &#8230; were proving out that system [the XQ-67] and making sure that it got through that first flight and airworthiness. And now that has been picked up &#8230; that program, OBSS, &#8230; did a seamless transition over to the CCA program.' Maj. Gen. Cain is the current head of AFTC and was previously in charge of AFRL. The XQ-67 broke cover in February, as The War Zone was first to report, and the drone took the skies for the first time later that month. In February, AFRL also presented the first real public chronology of how it arrived at OBSS, as you can read more about here. Simply put, a direct line flows from the Low Cost Attritable Aircraft Technologies (LCAAT) initiative, which kicked off in 2014, to LCAAPS in 2018, and then to OBSS in 2021. An explicit link from OBSS to CCA was not drawn at that time. CCA is leveraging other efforts, past and present, including the Air Force's Skyborg project, as well. LCAAT also separately led to the Low Cost Attritable Strike Demonstrator (LCASD) project under which the Air Force acquired its first example of the Kratos XQ-58 Valkyrie drone. At least a concept for an armed, higher-performance companion to the OBSS 'sensor truck' drone, called the Off-Board Weapons Station (OBWS), also exists. It is unknown whether or not an actual uncrewed aircraft is being developed, or already has been, as part of the exploration of OBWS. A key element of both OBSS and OBWS, and the overarching LCAAPs effort, was the idea of very modular designs using a high degree of common physical architecture. The Air Force and General Atomics have since described the idea of a common core as a 'genus' from which multiple 'species' of very differently configured drones can be created. Ahead of the AFA conference, AFRL put out the video below about LCAAPS and its underlying philosophy. 'So the Test Center supported the Lab in getting XQ-67 to that first flight and to do some early characterization of the platform,' Maj. Gen. Cain added at the roundtable yesterday. 'There are other lessons from this about building a common chassis that will be carried forward. And the CCA program is ingesting those and thinking about those for future increments of the system.' The CCA program is structured around relatively rapid iterative development cycles. General Atomics and Anduril are currently developing designs as part of the first cycle, or Increment One. The Air Force is also in the process of finalizing requirements for Increment Two. A model of Anduril's Fury drone, which it is now developing under the CCA program, that was shown at the AFA conference this week. Jamie Hunter As already noted, General Atomics has confirmed that its Increment One CCA is based on the XQ-67. The company is also now marketing an entire family of drones called Gambit that leverage a common core chassis. 'There's an [XQ-67] OBSS down there [on the AFA show floor]. &#8230; There's also [model of] a General Atomics CCA offering down there,' Air Force Gen. Duke Richardson, head of Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC), said at the same media roundtable yesterday as Maj. Gen. Cain. 'So they might be similar, but they're not exact. So if you look at them closely, they're not exact. So we definitely learned a lot from the XQ-67.' That OBSS and CCA are directly linked at a programmatic level is not surprising. In February, The War Zone highlighted the similarities in language being used to describe key elements of both programs, as how well the then newly disclosed OBWS concept seemed to align with the Air Force's CCA plans, writing: 'Overall, OBSS looks more and more like it is at least a related exploratory effort running in parallel to the CCA program, and one that could be a key stepping stone for the latter to achieve its ambitious goals. The potential existence of an armed, higher-performance drone developed under OBWS, or at least the exploration of such a design, would also align with the CCA effort.' Interestingly, Michael Atwood, Vice President of Advanced Programs for General Atomics, described the company's CCA entry 'as more of a weapons station' to the XQ-67's 'sensor station in an exclusive interview with The War Zone from the AFA convention floor, which you can find here. A graphical depiction of the core 'genus/species' concept behind LCAAPS and, by extension, OBSS. USAF capture The Air Force's confirmation now of an explicit link between OBSS, and by extension LCAAPS, and CCA is still significant and raises new and interesting questions about how this focus may impact the latter program. The Air Force has already made clear that, win or lose, contractors can compete in as many increments of the program as they want. In addition, the service has said that companies not selected to develop CCA designs could still get contracts to actually build them in order to help meet its ambitious production and fielding timelines. Even having contractors utilize a centralized pool of components to some degree could help further accelerate these schedules, while also helping to reduce costs and streamline supply chains for sustainment down the road. It isn't clear what advantages the CCA program directly leveraging OBSS could provide to General Atomics. The Air Force does have a clear interest in the modular chassis approach that General Atomics has now done significant risk reduction prototyping on with the XQ-67, which is still being very actively tested. The XQ-67 on the ground. USAF Courtesy photo via USAF The hope currently is that General Atomics and Anduril will have their Increment One designs flying by the end of the end of next year, if not well before then, and that the first operational CCAs will enter service before the end of the decade. Increment Two is supposed to kick off next year, as well. 'So what should Increment 2 be? Do not assume and it may not be just an evolution of Increment 1. It could be an entirely different set of missions. Could be [an] entirely different kind of an aircraft,' Andrew Hunter, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology & Logistics, had said at the 2024 Defense News Conference earlier this month. 'And so part of that initial work is, again, starting with a large vendor pool, what are the good ideas out there? We’ll have some ideas [about] what we think Increment 2 needs to do as part of a broader force, and that’s part of this broader look at air dominance and how we’re going to deliver that.' With what we know now, whatever CCAs the Air Force chooses to buy under any increment of the program could well look very different outwardly, but be much more similar inside than meets the eye.
