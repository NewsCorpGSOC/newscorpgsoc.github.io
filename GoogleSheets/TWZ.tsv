Aleppo Has Fallen, Assad’s Forces Regrouping As Rebels Blitz Sout...	A day after entering Aleppo, rebels have reportedly seized most of the city, Syria’s second-largest, pushed south toward Hama and captured much of Idlib province on Saturday in their surprise offensive launched on Thursday. In reaction, the Russian Air Force bombarded rebel positions in Aleppo, the first time they've struck the city in any robust capacity in the better part of a decade . Meanwhile, there are unconfirmed reports of a coup attempt against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the capital of Damascus. You can catch up with our previous report on the rebel advance here. Led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, this offensive is its first major attack against the regime in four years and comes as Iran's top proxy force Hezbollah and Russia - Assad’s biggest backers - are embroiled in their own conflicts. Hezbollah, which supports the Assad regime, has been greatly degraded after open conflict with Israel and some Russian resources have been realigned away from Syria to fight in Ukraine. HTS, formerly an al-Qaida-affiliated group known as al-Nusra Front, has since cut its ties to the notorious Sunni jihadi organization. ALEPPO, SYRIA - NOVEMBER 30: Armed groups opposing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime seized control of much of Aleppo's city center in Syria on November 30, 2024. Reaching Sadallah al-Jabiri Square, a central location in the city, the groups advanced further, taking over a significant portion of Aleppo. In a short period, the opposition forces also seized the governor's office, the police headquarters, and Aleppo Citadel, a symbolic landmark of the city.

Assad on Saturday vowed to 'defend [Syria's] stability and territorial integrity in the face of all terrorists and their backers,' according to the BBC. '[The country] is capable, with the help of its allies and friends, of defeating and eliminating them, no matter how intense their terrorist attacks are,' his office quoted him as saying. The Syrian strongman is getting help in the form of the aforementioned Russian airstrikes on rebel positions in Aleppo. Russian tactical jets and attack helicopters have been active from Khmeimim Air Base, near the city of Latakia, since 2015, providing vital support to the regime in Damascus. The bombardment reportedly resulted in civilian casualties, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a London-based watchdog organization monitoring the conflict. 'At least 16 civilians were killed and 20 others were injured in a horrific massacre carried out by fighter jets believed to be Russian, targeting a gathering of people at Al-Basel Roundabout in Aleppo city,' SOHR claimed 'The number of civilians and combatants, who were killed in Idlib and Aleppo countryside during the 'Deterrence of Aggression' operation which started in the early hours of November 27, has increased to 327.' Aleppo has already been badly ravaged by years of war. It was first captured by rebel forces in 2012 and it became the site of a months-long siege in 2016. Russia and Syrian aircraft carried out constant air strikes that destroyed entire neighborhoods as Syrian regime forces fought to recapture the city of roughly two million residents. HTS also said on Saturday that it had taken control of several areas on the outskirts of Hama, a government-controlled city and Syria’s fourth-largest. The rebels took over regime positions in at least 15 villages and towns, according to SOHR. 'This approach coincided with consecutive withdrawals by the regime forces from positions in Hama City, Hama Military Airport and several other positions, while several members of a military convoy of the regime fled,' SOHR reported. 'Meanwhile, nearly 15 military convoys withdrew from Hama towards Homs.' The status of control over Hama remains unclear and the city could still remain at least partially contested. Regardless, the airbase there that was used by Russia and the regime as under rebel control, as is the main airport in Aleppo. Russian and Syrian forces have reportedly fled Hama airbase, most likely leaving behind a large amount of equipment and munitions. pic.twitter.com/h20cZNElBP&mdash; OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) November 30, 2024 HTS leader Abu Mohammed al Jawlani vowed to fight on to Damascus.

As it pushed south toward Hama, HTS had reportedly captured a number of regime troops, which you can see in the video below.

Syria state TV stopped broadcasting.The videos and information are not verified. pic.twitter.com/y3SGGTM83X&mdash; Anton Gerashchenko (@Gerashchenko_en) November 30, 2024 Officials from Iran have pushed back on those claims. Hossein Akbari, the Iranian Ambassador to Syria, said there was no military coup in Damascus nor any attempt to detain Assad, the official Iranian Shafaq news agency reported. 'The news published by some Iranian online platforms about a coup in Damascus surprised us,' Akbari stated, 'The Syrian army knows what needs to be done. This sedition will be crushed, God willing.' A reporter for Tasnim, another official Iranian news outlet, said the streets of Damascus are calm and called the claims 'a psychological operation by the terrorists and their supporters to break the resistance and advance further.' The War Zone cannot confirm any of these claims The ongoing offensive against the regime is one of the most serious challenges Assad has faced since the Syrian civil war began in 2011 when regime forces responded to Arab Spring protests with deadly force. That ignited years of bloodshed, forcing some 14 million Syrians to flee their homes, about half to places elsewhere in the country. The vacuum created by all this conflict has turned Syria into a regional crisis, drawing in troops from Turkey, Kurdish forces from Iraq and Iranian-backed Lebanese Hezbollah fighters. Israel routinely bombs Iranian troops and weapons concentrations in Syria. Jerusalem is watching the rebel advances in Syria with considerable wariness, as intelligence chiefs told the political echelon developments in Syria could ultimately spell trouble for Israel, according to Israeli media. 'Referring to a consultation hurriedly convened by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday evening with key figures in the defense establishment…intelligence officials assessing that ‘Iranian infrastructure in Syria has been harmed, and much of it has been captured by the rebels,’' the Times of Israel reported. Netanyahu was reportedly said that Hezbollah’s attention will now be shifted to Syria, and 'so will its forces, in order to defend the Assad regime.' Israeli intelligence officials are concerned that Assad's fall could allow the 'strategic capabilities' of his regime to fall into the jihadists’ hands. The prime concern relates to 'the remnants of chemical weapons,' according to the Times of Israel. Amid all this, the U.S. maintains a presence near Deir Ezzor in the north officially to continue the fight in a coalition against ISIS, which established a so-called 'caliphate' in large portions of Syria and Iraq in the wake of years of conflict. Saturday night, the White House said the U.S. 'has nothing to do with this offensive, which is led by Hay’at Tahir al-Sham (HTS), a designated terrorist organization&#8230;We will also continue to fully defend and protect U.S. personnel and U.S. military positions, which remain essential to ensuring that ISIS can never again resurge in Syria.' The White House has released its First Statement, since the beginning of the ongoing Rebel Offensive in Northern Syria, with them stating, 'The United States has nothing to do with this Offensive, which is led by Hay’at Tahir al-Sham (HTS), a Designated Terrorist Organization -… pic.twitter.com/jTGDqC5RqA&mdash; OSINTdefender (@sentdefender) December 1, 2024 As we previously mentioned, there appears to be a major fight looming in and around the city of Hama. How much longer Assad can hold on is a lingering question, exacerbated by the fact that his two main backers have their own troubles siphoning off resources otherwise available for Syria. Russia is bogged down in a nearly three-year-old war in Ukraine, forcing it to redeploy capabilities and personnel that were previously being used in support of the Syrian regime. Russian interests in Syria include the aforementioned Khmeimim Air Base, as well as access to port facilities at Tartus. These two bases serve as the only Russian facilities of their kind in the Mediterranean, making them highly strategic but also symbolic prizes that Moscow gained in exchange for saving Assad. Iran, meanwhile, has seen its proxy Hezbollah, which has a substantial presence is Syria, severely weakened by Israel, and the Israeli Air Force has continued to pound Iranian and Iranian-proxy targets in Syria. The HTS-led offensive has been as stunning as it has been swift. Whether it has the troops, equipment and logistical tail to not only push through Hama, but further south to Homs and eventually Damascus is something we will learn more about in the coming days. And while a lightning-fast blitz may be impressive, holding the territory gained against regrouped Syrian-Russia-Iranian-backed forces will be no easy task.

Rebel Forces Enter Syria’s Second Largest City Of Aleppo	Syrian rebels have entered the country’s second city of Aleppo, after launching a dramatic surprise attack on the government-held areas of northern Aleppo province earlier this week. The development is significant: not only was Aleppo previously seen as very well defended, but it has also been four years since Syrian government forces lost significant swathes of territory. The insurgents had entered Aleppo as of this afternoon, local time. Meanwhile, the Associated Press said that residents reported hearing missiles striking the city’s outskirts.

Ahead of that, there were multiple reports and further videos showing fierce fighting on the outskirts of the city. Reports suggest that the rebels entered the city from the southwest outskirts, with clashes with regime forces reported less than six miles from there earlier today, in an area straddling the Idlib and Aleppo provinces. Mohamed Bashir, the leader of the jihadist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which is at the forefront of the rebel offensive, stated in a press conference today: 'This operation aims to repel the sources of fire of the criminal enemy from the frontlines.'

A significant number of the rebel fatalities were caused by Russian airstrikes.

The rebel offensive was only launched on Wednesday, apparently led by the HTS but also includes other allied factions, including Turkish-backed Syrian rebel groups. After HTS fighters flooded out of their base in the rebel-held Idlib countryside, the northwest of Syria was scene to some of the fiercest fighting seen in the country for several years.

According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), regime forces have carried out at least 125 airstrikes and shelled areas across the Idlib and western Aleppo provinces. In the process, at least 12 civilians have been killed and 46 injured, while 14,000 more have been displaced, the OCHA says.

Assad’s forces put down the original uprising with assistance from Russia and Iran. The arrival of Russian military forces in 2015, in particular, proved to be a turning point for Assad. After losing control of around four-fifths of the country, the Russian intervention helped swing the conflict back in favor of the regime.

In more recent years, with backing from Moscow and Tehran, Assad has remained in power, while the intensity of the conflict has decreased. However, the level of control Assad has over the country is fragile in places, as the latest rebel offensive has demonstrated. Notably, as well as having control over much of the northwest Idlib area, HTS also has strongholds in smaller areas within the Aleppo, Hama, and Latakia provinces.

Photo by Anas Alkharboutli/picture alliance via Getty Images picture alliance At the same time, more pressure has been applied on the Syrian regime by Israel, which has stepped up its campaign of airstrikes targeting Iranian proxy forces that operate in the country. This has put the Iranian forces on the defensive, meaning they can no longer contribute as much to shoring up Assad’s forces against the rebels. In addition, Tehran is currently more focused on the fate of Hezbollah in Lebanon, and Hamas in Gaza, as well as the prospect of further strikes on its own territory by Israel. HTS has specifically said it will target Iranian forces fighting alongside Syrian government troops. Yesterday, an Iranian news agency reported the death of a general in Iran’s Revolutionary Guards in Syria, during fighting between government forces and jihadists. As well as more than 100 Israeli airstrikes on Syrian territory, the war in the Middle East has forced around half a million people to flee the conflict in Lebanon for the relative safety of Syria. Assad’s other major backer, Russia, is meanwhile bogged down in the war in Ukraine, where it has redeployed forces — including air defense units — that were previously being used in support of the Syrian regime. Rebel fighters pose in front of a seized Syrian Army tank in the village of Talhiyah, located east of the northwestern Syrian city of Idlib after the area was taken over by jihadists and their Turkish-backed allies in the latest battles with government forces in the northern Syrian Aleppo province, on November 29, 2024. Photo by Omar HAJ KADOUR / AFP OMAR HAJ KADOUR This leaves Syria as something of a distraction for Russia and it’s notable that, in a statement from the Kremlin today, its spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, called upon Syrian authorities to quickly regain control and thwart the rebel attack, which he described as a violation of Syria’s sovereignty. Russian interests in Syria include the aforementioned Khmeimim Air Base, as well as access to port facilities at Tartus. These two bases serve as the only Russian facilities of their kind in the Mediterranean, making them highly strategic but also symbolic prizes that Moscow gained in exchange for saving Assad.

Photo by PAUL GYPTEAU/AFP via Getty Images PAUL GYPTEAU Another major player is Turkey, which backs several rebel groups active along Syria’s northern border. Recently, Turkey has made efforts to re-establish relations with Assad, but it’s unclear exactly how it will respond to this latest round of fighting. Already, some Turkey-backed factions have joined the new offensive. At this point, it appears that the Syrian rebels, including HTS, have identified a weakness in the Syrian regime’s grip on the northwest of the country, compounded by Israel’s attacks on Iranian proxies in Syria, as well as Russia’s focus on Ukraine. Even against this backdrop, it’s surprising how fast the Syrian regime forces have apparently crumbled in the face of the latest rebel offensive. It remains to be seen whether Aleppo will fall but there are also major questions about the ability of Assad’s forces to respond in an effective way, especially without rapid backing from Russia and/or Iran.

Drone Incursions Over USAF Bases In UK Enter Second Week	After more than a week of drones being spotted over four of its facilities in England, Air Force officials are still trying to find out who is flying them, why they are being flown, and the relationship between incidents at different installations. One thing is clear, however. They are not being operated by your average drone enthusiasts. Two U.S. officials told The War Zone that these drones 'do not appear to be the work of hobbyists.' Witnesses say they are quadcopters and octocopters and are more sophisticated than consumer off-the-shelf models. The incidents at RAF Lakenheath, RAF Mildenhall, and RAF Fitwell 'appear to be connected,' one of those officials added. The relationship to drones seen over RAF Fairford is less clear. The War Zone was first to report the drone incursions. They began to appear on Nov. 20 and continue to this day. A stock picture of a 'No Drone Zone' sign and other warnings along the perimeter of RAF Lakenheath. Mark Kerrison/In Pictures via Getty Images 'Small unmanned aerial systems continue to be spotted in the vicinity of and over Royal Air Force Lakenheath, RAF Mildenhall, RAF Feltwell and RAF Fairford since Nov. 20,' Air Force Capt. Ryan Walsh, spokesman for the 48th Fighter Wing at Lakenheath, told us in a statement today. 'To date, installation leaders have determined that none of the incursions impacted base residents, facilities or assets. The Air Force is taking all appropriate measures to safeguard the aforementioned installations and their residents.' The number of systems 'has fluctuated, and they have ranged in sizes and configurations,' he added. 'Our units continue to monitor the airspace and are working with host-nation authorities and mission partners to ensure the safety of base personnel, facilities and assets. To safeguard operational security, we do not discuss specific force protection measures, however we retain the right to protect our installations. We request individuals in the area to contact either local police or Security Forces if they see anything suspicious, to include sUAS's or drone activity.' U.K Defense Minister Maria Eagle said the government was 'taking steps' to deal with the incursions, the BBC reported. 'Protection of our personnel and bases is of course our highest priority,' said Eagle, speaking during a debate on UK air and missile defenses at Westminster Hall. 'For security reasons I won't go into specifics. But we are taking steps and we are aware of what's going on and doing our best to deal with it.' 'We will be making sure that anybody we manage to catch for engaging in this behaviour will be shown the full force of the law for their illegal activities,' she added. Aircraft spotters outside Lakenheath claim they have seen F-15E Strike Eagles sent aloft in response to the incursions. Flight tracking software has also shown interesting aerial operations around the base as the sightings have progressed. F-15E's targeting pods would be especially useful in finding, identifying and tracking the low-flying drones. However, Air Force officials have not confirmed that they are using the fighters in an attempt to track the drones. Surely multiple aerial assets have been deployed to help ascertain what exactly is going on and at whose command. UK assets, including police helicopters and intelligence-gathering turboprops are likely to have been used in the hunt. The 48th Fighter Wing, with its F-35A Joint Strike Fighters and aforementioned F-15E Strike Eagles is the base tenant unit at Lakenheath. The 100th Air Refueling Wing, which flies KC-135s, is the main unit at Mildenhall. The 352nd Special Operations Wing with its MC-130s and CV-22s is also among the base tenants. There have also been signs that Lakenheath is at least being prepared to re-host U.S. nuclear bombs after those weapons were removed from the country in 2008. Feltwell also houses personnel from the 48th Fighter Wing and serves as an additional logistical node for American forces in the country. Ironically, Lakenheath was home to fighter wings that defended Israel against Iranian drones as well as missiles during Tehran's massive barrage in April. Several airmen at Lakenheath received medals for heroics during that operation. You can read more about that here. U.S. Air Force Capt. Lacie Hester, 494th Fighter Squadron F-15E weapon systems operator, is congratulated by fellow decoration recipients after receiving the Silver Star during a ceremony at RAF Lakenheath, England, Nov. 12, 2024. The Silver Star is the United States Armed Forces third-highest military decoration for valor in combat and was presented based on the aircrew’s gallantry in action repelling the Iranian attack as the airborne mission commanders directing coalition forces during the unprecedented large-scale attack against Israel. (U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Olivia Gibson) On Tuesday, officials from USAFE added RAF Fairford to the list of bases experiencing drone incursions. Unlike the other three facilities which are in close proximity, Fairford is about 100 miles to the southwest. Fairford is the main bomber forward operating location in Europe for the U.S. Air Force Global Strike Command. Bomber Task Force-Europe sees B-1s, B-52s, and B-2s rotate into the theater fairly regularly for operations with NATO and other allies and to ‘deter’ Russia. It is also home to small contingents of U-2 spy planes. There are four B-52 Stratofortress bombers currently at the base and flying missions around Europe. On Nov. 25, two B-52H Stratofortress bombers assigned to the 20th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron conducted a simulated weapons drop training mission as part of Bomber Task Force 25-1 in Finland, according to USAFE.

Within this area it's illegal to fly any UAS without permission.'

'We routinely engage with our local community on such matters, and regularly remind local drone users of the restrictions in place in order to keep our aerodrome safe via social media,' a spokesperson stated in response to our query about the warning. 'This was a routine reminder post.' Civilian drone operations are prohibited over wide swaths of British airspace, largely over military installations, which you can see in the following map compiled by the UK AIS Internet Briefing System. The map is interactive to allow drone operators to know the local restrictions. UK AIS Internet Briefing System The U.K. Defense Ministry (MoD) declined to say whether there is a nationwide effort to have its installations warn drone operators in the wake of these incursions. 'What the RAF or USAF offer to our people/units is not something that would be shared with anyone outside of the military,' a spokesman told us. 'The MOD continues to take this matter seriously and as previously stated are working closely with USVF [U.S. Visiting Forces], Police, and other partners to respond to recent events.' The MoD also declined to confirm reports, which we noted yesterday, that 60 British troops have been deployed across three bases in the United Kingdom that host American forces in response to ongoing drone incidents. Nor would they confirm reports that the NINJA counter-drone system - originally developed for the U.S. Air Force and subsequently became part of the Royal Air Force ORCUS counter-drone system - have been deployed to these bases as well. After more than a week, who is operating these drones and for what purpose remain open questions. These incursions underscore very real concerns about uncrewed aerial threats to critical military facilities and civilian infrastructure. TWZ has been on the leading edge of covering this topic for years and has broken multiple stories now about drone incursions over key U.S. bases and training ranges, as well as uncrewed aerial systems harassing American forces off the coasts of the United States and making worrisome overflights of important non-military sites. A spate of drone incursions over Langley Air Force Base in Virginia in December 2023, which TWZ was the first report on, has now become a particular focal point of growing concern about these issues. That drones are flying every day over U.S. bases in England is extremely troubling. The Pentagon's effort to respond to them likely faces hurdles similar to those it does domestically, which you can read more about here. Any response may be additionally complicated because the U.S. is a guest of the U.K. and has to work out authorization for the use of counter-drone measures with local officials. I know people are going out looking for the drones at these bases in the UK. Quick reminder, without lights on they are very hard to spot, especially from a distance. Counter-UAS (C-UAS) systems primarily rely on passive detection of the radio frequency energy the drones emit (if…&mdash; Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) November 26, 2024 We will continue to monitor these incursions and provide updates when warranted.

Navy Ship Menus From Thanksgivings Past	Here at TWZ, we pride ourselves on bringing you the best in defense reporting, powered by open-source intelligence. But as we glide into the Thanksgiving weekend, it’s important to note one critical finding we have confirmed through a variety of channels: Stuffing is the best part of Thanksgiving dinner. Stuffing is the best because it’s so savory, so complementary and at the same time unifying on one’s Thanksgiving dinner plate. What’s more, it’s rarely eaten at other times of the year, although in the opinion of your humble reporter, it should be featured more often. Why is your humble reporter, the latest addition to the TWZ editorial team, going on and on about the glories of stuffing, you might ask? Well, because stuffing was not always the Thanksgiving staple that it is today, on land or at sea. Instead, Navy Thanksgivings from yesteryear featured a variety of deliciously outlandish, outlandishly delicious and plain old strange food items. See for yourself below, where we have assembled some sea service Thanksgiving dinner menus that American sailors enjoyed during holidays past, stretching back to the early 1900s. Looking at these menus might remind sailors of all ages that it's hard to be far from home for the holiday. But while missing home and family, the service member deployed during this time is hopefully with a new set of loved ones, enjoying a gut-buster of a meal, and feeling thankful for the food in front of them and the shipmates to their left and right. Shoutout to the U.S. Naval Historical and Heritage Command for gathering these artifacts in one place. You can check out all their old menus here. Extra shoutout to the young sailors back then who had the forethought to stash their menu copy so that it’s around for us to marvel at today. The Navy’s listing of old-time menus only extends into the 1950s, so apologies in advance to the menus from subsequent decades that we missed. Happy Thanksgiving, all, and feel free to do battle in the comments (civilly!) over which is the best Thanksgiving food. USS KENTUCKY (BB-6), 1907 The ship: This Kearsarge-class battleship had been in service for about seven years when its crew assembled for Thanksgiving 117 years ago, and it would go on to serve until 1920. (U.S. Navy) The good: Two main proteins in roast turkey and Smithfield ham. Not unsatisfactory. Also, giblet gravy should be the only gravy. The not so good: It was different times, of course, but celery and crackers are meal adornments, and do not belong as featured players on any Thanksgiving menu. USS ARKANSAS (BB-33), 1919 The ship: The Wyoming-class battleship had transited the Panama Canal earlier in 1919, joining up with the Pacific Fleet, where it operated over the next two years. All that hemispheric transiting would make any sailor hungry. (U.S. Navy) The good: Both candied ham and coconut layer cake are due for a comeback, and it’s always nice when a sailor’s tobacco is offered in both cigar and cigarette form. The not so good: The menu cover sort of looks like a carrion bird gnawing at an American coat of arms. Lettuce and celery are once again featured far too prominently. USS CASE (DD-370), 1929 The ship: A Mahan-class destroyer that survived the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and later saw action at Iwo Jima. (U.S. Navy) The good: This time the boys on board got fancy celery, instead of the standard issue fare. The sweet pickles are a nice touch, and 'Roast Vermont Turkey' sounds simply delightful. The not so good: Maybe creamed peas, but to each their own. USS ALTAIR (AD-11), 1932 The ship: A destroyer tender that began its life not as a Navy ship, but as a single-screw freighter known as Edisto. The humble support ship became a tender in 1922 and spent years helping out its fellow gray-hull shipmates. (U.S. Navy) The good: A nice mix of holiday festiveness and juvenile patriotism on the menu cover. Mulligatawny soup! The not so good: Soda crackers. Bananas. I’ll take 'What Should Not Be Listed On The Holiday Menu But Instead Assumed To Be A Given On The Mess Deck' for $2,000. USS AUGUSTA (CL-31), 1942 The ship: A light cruiser that was later re-designated a heavy cruiser, it served as the headquarters for Task Force 34 during Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of North Africa from Nov. 8 to Nov. 16, 1942. The Navy’s history of the ship also notes that Augusta intercepted multiple enemy cruisers and destroyers during the operation, then returned to firing on shore batteries. (U.S. Navy) The good: Every sailor earns their holiday meals, but doubly so for those aboard the mighty Augusta. This menu reflects a command taking care of their sailors. Several French-inspired dishes are featured, and now I want to find a recipe for baked spiced Spam. The not so good: I’m dubious about scalloping a tomato. NAVAL AIR STATION NORFOLK 1958 The ship: It’s not a ship. It was an East Coast Navy base whose menu features a fun image of SN Timmy leading a tom to his final place of rest. (U.S. Navy) The good: Snow white potatoes suggest an extreme level of fluffiness, and where can I score some Hawaiian pineapple sauce? Sounds like a more jovial version of apple sauce. The not so good: Any commander only offering stuffing with apples and raisins in it should be taken to Mast. Happy Thanksgiving to all our readers and especially to our men and women in uniform serving abroad or sitting in alert sites or in front of missile control screens while their families gather not far away.

Warheads In Phoenix Ghost Kamikaze Drones Blast Straight Down As ...	With its previously highly secretive Phoenix Ghost family of kamikaze drones now having emerged fully into the light, AEVEX Aerospace has been more openly discussing their capabilities. One especially interesting detail has now emerged: the different Phoenix Ghost types can be configured to launch attacks straight down while passing overhead rather than having to careen into their targets and detonate. The top-down attack capability was a particular highlight of a Phoenix Ghost promotional video AEVEX released earlier this month, seen below. The footage was captured during Northern Strike 24-2, a joint-service exercise the Michigan National Guard led this past summer that included a variety of air, ground, and maritime components, including JSX-2 microjets masquerading as cruise missiles and drones. AEVEX had offered its first official details about the Phoenix Ghost family, originally developed as part of an effort under the Air Force’s Big Safari special projects office and then rushed to Ukraine in the wake of Russia's invasion in 2022, last month. Information about the drones, or even what they looked like, had been extremely closely guarded before then. AEVEX brought three types of Phoenix Ghost drones – the Dagger, Dominator, and Disruptor – to Northern Strike 24-2. There is evidence of all three of these types being in service in Ukraine. At least one other member of the family, the Atlas, is known to exist, but it is unclear if Ukrainian forces have received them in addition to the other types. 'The Dagger is actually one of our earliest designs,' a member of AEVEX says in the video. 'So, 55 pounds with a little bit of a smaller warhead and really going about 100-150 kilometers [range-wise]. &#8230; a small unit can operate it and make a difference on the battle space in specific tactical scenarios.' The remains of a Dagger kamikaze drone, one member of the Phoenix Ghost family, launched by Ukrainian forces. via X The Dominators are &#8230; really our heavy truck system that's out there,' that same individual continues. '[It has] 100 pounds worth of payload [and] flies over five hours. [It] really can take a lot of whatever you want to carry a long way or loiter over a particular area for a long time.' When it comes to Dominator, a picture, seen below and said to have been taken in Russia proper, emerged earlier this year showing what looks to be one of the drones. However, questions have been raised about whether this might be a locally-produced derivative of some kind given that the U.S. government had imposed, at least publicly, significant restrictions on Ukrainian forces using American-made munitions to attack targets inside Russian territory at that time. Certain exceptions and caveats were known to exist at the time. Drones can stray far from planned flight paths for various reasons, as well. American authorities have more recently loosened the restrictions in question. The wreckage of a one-way attack drone — which looks to be the Dominator, or a derivative of it — used to attack Russia earlier this year. via X 'The Disruptor is really a simple design with a lot of capability,' he adds. 'So, it's a simple design in terms of manufacturing. It's also a simple design in terms of operations. So, very easy to put together out in the field, but still with – now you're talking about 50 pounds payload to be able to carry that again, five to six hours [in terms of endurance]. So, still packs quite a punch.' Footage of a AEVEX Disruptor loitering munition, which is part of the Phoenix Ghost program, from a Russian Telegram channel. pic.twitter.com/ycVltOqeO4&mdash; Rob Lee (@RALee85) November 26, 2024 In terms of 'punch,' the AEVEX video shows all three designs conducting top-down attacks using blast fragmentation warheads that shower their targets in deadly shrapnel. Pictures, seen in the social media post below, that recently emerged of the remains of Disruptor launched by Ukrainian forces show the warhead section in that drone featured a pre-scored 'sleeve' designed to break into fragments after detonation. Wreckage of a U.S.-made AEVEX Disruptor loitering munition of the AFU.#Ukraine #Russia #USA pic.twitter.com/UyFzk7ZdJ3&mdash; Chronology (@Chronology22) November 26, 2024 Top-down air-bursting attacks offer significant benefits over a point-detonating design, especially when it comes to engaging personnel or unarmored targets in trenches or otherwise behind cover. They can be very effective against various targets out in the open, including aircraft and air defense systems, and soft-skinned vehicles, and offer more of an area effect, in general. It was not obvious initially, but the earlier AEVEX promotional video seen below contains additional views of the Phoenix Ghost family's top-down attack profile. Whether other warhead types, such as ones with greater anti-armor capability, are available for the Phoenix Ghost family or might be in development is unknown, but would also fit well with the top-down mode of attack. The tops of tanks and other armored vehicles are typically where they are most vulnerable. The growing specter of top-down attacks, including by drones and specially designed anti-tank guided missiles, is already having impacts on the design of new defensive capabilities for armored vehicles. Earlier this year, Israeli defense contractor Rafael unveiled a new version of its combat-proven Trophy active protection system (APS) with features to help defeat threats from above. 'We haven’t really gotten into anti-tank or anti-armor, just because it’s not been a requirement for us,' Elizabeth Trammell, senior director of business development at AEVEX, did tell TWZ at AUSA back in October. 'A lot of our aircraft, we had the base capability and then our customers came in and said, ‘This is what we want.’' It is still not clear exactly how Phoenix Ghost drones know where and when to detonate their warheads, if they can engage moving targets, or if they can execute attacks in other modes. 'AEVEX loitering munitions automatically detect, identify, locate, report (DILR) and deliver lethal and non-lethal effects against threats across multiple scenarios and domains with unprecedented accuracy and speed' and are able to 'navigate, make decisions, and complete missions without direct intervention,' according to the company's website. As already noted, Daggers and Disruptors have clearly been employed in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, and Dominators look to be in use, too. With the details that have emerged so far, experts and observers now know what to look for and have also gone back and identified imagery of many previously unknown drones as members of the Phoenix Ghost family. 1. Mystery solved, sort of. Early in 2024 a number of strange drones crashed in russia: a typical wreckage is shown here. I spent a lot of time trying to determine who made these but recently the manufacturer publicity announced this drone . Regardless, here is what I found. pic.twitter.com/a1BkM6DbUM&mdash; DanielR (@DanielR33187703) November 26, 2024 13. At this point the story would normally end - except for one detail. The crashed drones’ propellers had the word 'Front' handwritten on them. This exact same writing appeared on propellers of a different drone. This meant they were almost certainly made by the same company. pic.twitter.com/NU5Tvsyo7U&mdash; DanielR (@DanielR33187703) November 26, 2024 16. This drone is the Dagger also by Aevex. These drones have been in Ukraine since at least January, 2023 and significant advances in their designs have been observed. The flight control board has seen several iterations so the information shown here is likely out-of-date. pic.twitter.com/NCP2abSlSJ&mdash; DanielR (@DanielR33187703) November 26, 2024 AEVEX has also said it is actively pursuing new Phoenix Ghost sales opportunities, which could well come along with further developments for the entire family, beyond the conflict in Ukraine. Regardless, now that the kamikaze drones have come out of the shadows, more insights into their capabilities, including their modes of attack, seem likely to continue emerging.

Australian F-35 Tests Expeditionary Base Concept	The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) has experimented with a new, rapidly laid temporary airfield surface, which should make it easier to conduct expeditionary aircraft operations, something that is of increasing relevance across the Indo-Pacific region. The trial, which used a temporary surface known as Dura-Base, involved an RAAF F-35A stealth fighter at RAAF Base Tindal, a remote installation south of Darwin, in Australia’s Northern Territory. Dura-Base comprises heavy-duty mats that can be locked together, providing a continuous stable surface. The F-35A involved was from the RAAF’s 75 Squadron, resident at Tindal, and one of three frontline RAAF squadrons now flying the jet, along with an operational training unit. Australia has 72 F-35As on order. Ground crew lay the temporary surface known as Dura-Base at RAAF Base Tindal, in Australia’s Northern Territory. Australian Defense Force While the RAAF confirms that Dura-Base can be used for the rapid construction of taxiways, aprons, and other hardstands, even in remote areas, a conventional runway is still required for the actual takeoff and landing, with published photos showing the F-35A using the Dura-Base strip as a taxiway to access an existing runway. The trial at Tindal was conducted by a team from 65 Air Base Recovery Squadron and was coordinated by RAAF Headquarters’ Air Capability Enablers Branch. Embedded in the team at Tindal were personnel from U.S. Air Force air base recovery and engineering squadrons. RAAF Base Tindal, Northern Territory. Google Earth 'A 2,000-square-meter [21,500-square-foot] apron was built in a matter of days and then successfully tested by a 75 Squadron F-35,' explained Flying Officer Georgia Foristal, the construction lead for the trial at Tindal. 'This was the first known use of Dura-Base for a fifth-generation aircraft,' Flying Officer Foristal added. It is worth noting at the point that RAAF Base Tindal has also been selected for upgrade work, funded by the U.S. government, which will include an expanded apron with space for six B-52 bombers, squadron operations facilities, and maintenance infrastructure. Once completed, the air base will be much better able to host bomber detachments, as well as tankers and fighters, with work also addressing fuel and munitions storage and mission planning buildings. You can read more about the plans for the base here as well as its possible involvement in recent U.S. airstrikes on Yemen, here. Part of the plans for the modernization work at RAAF Base Tindal, showing six B-52s on the new apron. sam.gov RAAF Tindal seen in May of 2024 with the new apron for supporting U.S. bombers under construction. Google Earth The type of matting used in Dura-Base is already used by the oil-drilling industry, specifically when a temporary load-bearing work platform needs to be set up on low-strength soils. That same technology has now been proven capable of supporting military aircraft. Squadron Leader Sean Jamieson, of the Air Capability Enablers Branch, explained: 'Because of its performance, Dura-Base was an ideal product to trial as a rapid aircraft taxiway and apron expansion capability for temporary operations in areas normally difficult for expedient pavement construction due to remoteness.' As well as the recent trial with the F-35A, it has previously been demonstrated that Dura-Base can handle the much larger and heavier C-17A airlifter. This experiment was carried out by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers back in 2007. Other trials have involved a U.S. Air Force KC-135 aerial refueling aircraft. An earlier Dura-Base trial involving a U.S. Air Force KC-135E tanker. JWA Oilfield Supplies On the one hand, the RAAF sees Dura-Base as a potential repair solution, something that would help keep a traditional air base operating even if it were to sustain damage during a conflict. This is of particular relevance in the north of Australia, which is an area of increasing strategic importance amid growing tensions with the Chinese military in the wider region. Squadron Leader Jamieson described Dura-Base as 'a very promising ADR [airfield damage repair] capability for Australia that will be used in a number of future applications.' Aviators from 65 Air Base Recovery Squadron assembling Dura-Base at RAAF Base Tindal. Australian Defense Force FLGOFF Michael Thomas Meanwhile, outside of established airfields, Dura-Base is being eyed as a means of helping generate airpower even in areas that don’t have such well-established air bases or ones that are not properly equipped to support sustained military aircraft operations. These could include temporary airstrips set up in northern Australia, as alternatives to established air base infrastructure. Beyond Australia’s own borders, Dura-Base would have clear utility for the kinds of agile operations that are increasingly seen as critical to supporting airpower in the Indo-Pacific region during any major contingency, especially during a future conflict involving China. In this respect, it’s also notable that the U.S. military was involved in the experiment at Tindal since it’s also evaluating new ways of ensuring that its aircraft can effectively operate in expeditionary-type campaigns, including in more contested environments. 'Working with the USAF members was a very positive experience and further enhanced interoperability between the RAAF and PACAF [Pacific Air Forces] regarding airfield damage repair capability,' Flying Officer Foristal noted.

Australian Department of Defense There already exist similar types of temporary runway surfaces, most notably the AM-2 matting that has been in use for decades, including by the RAAF, as well as by the U.S. Marine Corps, to create ad-hoc airstrips in the jungles of Vietnam. AM-2 aluminum planks are unloaded for onward transit to the temporary airstrip used by the U.S. Amrien Corps at Chu Lai, South Vietnam, in May 1965. National Archives However, Dura-Base offers advantages over this, according to Squadron Leader Jamieson, at least for taxiways and aprons. 'Although AM-2 matting has been successfully used since the 1960s, Dura-Base was demonstrated to be faster and easier to install,' he said. In particular, the new type of matting needs very little in the way of surface preparation before being laid. While AM-2 consists of aluminum planks, Dura-Base is much easier to handle, primarily being made of high-density polyethylene (HDPE), which also helps minimize the impact on the ground. According to JWA Oilfield Supplies, which provides Dura-Base to the oil industry in Australia, it’s possible to lay 400 linear meters (1,300 feet) of the matting in a single day. An F-35A from 75 Squadron taxis at RAAF Base Tindal, Northern Territory. Australian Defense Force LAC Brandon Murray Using an RAAF F-35A to prove the Dura-Base concept is interesting as this is an aircraft that usually requires some highly specialist infrastructure and maintenance demands. It also reflects the U.S. Air Force’s efforts to introduce the stealth fighter to austere airfield operations in the Indo-Pacific. Back in 2021, TWZ reported on an exercise on the island of Guam where F-35As were joined by F-16s operating from an austere airstrip at the northwest end of the island. A U.S. Air Force F-35A taxis during austere operations on Andersen AFB’s Northwest Field. U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Jonathan Valdes Montijo This exercise was part of the U.S. Air Force’s continuing efforts toward developing its Agile Combat Employment (ACE) initiative. This seeks to provide dispersed operating locations that can be accessed by U.S. Air Force combat aircraft during a crisis. The strategy is largely a result of the growing threat posed by Chinese missile and air attacks in the Pacific theater. Central to this is also moving aircraft rapidly — and unpredictably — between locations to stay outside of the enemy’s targeting cycle. Today, the RAAF, the U.S. Air Force, and other allied air forces that operate in the Pacific region are faced with the likelihood that a major conflict with China would see established bases damaged if not wiped out by ballistic missiles — or by other means. With relatively few major air bases in the region, facilities like RAAF Base Tindal and Andersen Air Force Base on Guam would be among China’s highest-priority targets, were it to go to war with either of these countries. U.S. Air Force F-22A Raptors assigned to the 27th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron along with Royal Australian Air Force F-35As from 75 Squadron and a KC-30A Multi-Role Tanker Transport aircraft from 33 Squadron, demonstrate a show of force by conducting an elephant walk at RAAF Base Tindal, Australia, July 31, 2024. U.S. Air Force photo by Staff Sgt. Spencer Tobler This reality has pushed the U.S. military to look for alternative options, including the forward bases at Wake Island and Tinian Island. Australia, too, is looking at ways to ensure airpower can be generated even if access to major air bases is denied or reduced. It can be imagined that an existing runway, or even a highway strip, from which F-35s also now operate, including with the U.S. Marine Corps, could, with the addition of Dura-Base, rapidly add taxiways, aprons, and aircraft servicing areas, transforming an austere airstrip into a much more functional installation, even if only temporarily. Overall, the growing importance of the Joint Strike Fighter within allied air forces means the stealth jet is increasingly involved in testing such concepts. As well as the recent experiment at Tindal and the U.S. Air Force’s exercise at Guam’s Northwest Field, the U.S. Marine Corps is also increasingly focused on austere operations for both its short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) F-35Bs and its F-35C carrier-capable variants. Marine F-35Cs have been put through their paces for Pacific-style expeditionary operations during maneuvers at the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center in 29 Palms, which you can read about here. A U.S. Marine Corps F-35C about to catch a mobile arresting gear on an expeditionary runway at 29 Palms. James Deboer Furthermore, there has been a recent suggestion that the ship-based Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System and Advanced Arresting Gear, known as EMALS and AAG, respectively, could be adapted for use on land. This would have clear implications for the kinds of expeditionary campaigns that would be fought in the Indo-Pacific theater, without access to large traditional runways. While there are various options for pursuing austere aircraft operations in the Indo-Pacific, they primarily focus on aircraft deployments that are more agile and less predictable, involving small packages of aircraft flying from remote locations, and potentially moving on again quickly. These kinds of operations also have relevance elsewhere in the world, most notably in Europe, where Russia can hold established NATO air bases under threat from missile attack. While it remains to be seen whether the RAAF — or perhaps even the U.S. Air Force — begins to use Dura-Base on a more regular basis, the recent trial at RAAF Base Tindal further underscores air commanders’ growing aspirations to make airpower more survivable and flexible.

China’s Wacky And Puzzling New Aircraft Carrier Has Set Sail	A mysterious Chinese vessel with a large open flight deck and three superstructures, which TWZ was first to report on, looks to have made its maiden voyage. Details about the flattop, which currently has various commercial-style rather than military markings and is unlike any other established Chinese Navy vessel class, are still scant. There remains a possibility that this could be a first-of-its-kind ostensibly civilian research ship. A video, which appears to show the vessel sailing under its own power, along with a still picture of the ship taken from the port side, has emerged online. Both are seen in the social media post below, which erroneously identifies it as a Type 075 amphibious warfare ship. 民用版075试航 pic.twitter.com/reQIGlxhNN&mdash; DS北风（风哥） (@WenJian0922) November 26, 2024 The ship has a distinctive arrangement with three island-like structures along the starboard side of the flight deck. Toward the bow end, there is a smaller island with a bridge and a traditional mast on top with what appears to be radars and potentially other sensors. In the middle, there is a longer and taller multi-storied island that has an enclosed mast structure on top with a ball radome at the tip. Masts of this kind often have additional sensors and systems installed along their slab-sides. It also has a rear-facing bridge, something typically seen in multi-island carrier layouts as a way to separate flight operations from the other tasks of sailing the ship. The last island structure toward the stern end contains a series of exhaust stacks. Another view of the mystery flattop showing its three 'island' configuration, as well as the masts on top of the forward and middle ones. Chinese Internet capture via X The still picture shows an open space at the stern, which might point to the presence of a well-deck with a gate that folds down when in use. An open space toward the stern on the port that looks like it could be tied to an elevator to move aircraft and other equipment between the main deck and a hangar deck on the port side has been previously seen with a lifeboat inside. What appears to be a crane for launching and recovering small boats and other payloads that stows inside a space inside of the hull is also visible. A closer look at the port side of the ship showing what may be a crane stowed in a space in the side the middle of the hull, the space in the side of the hull further toward the stern that holds a lifeboat, and the open area at the very stern. Chinese Internet via X Pictures that have previously emerged have also shown the state-run China State Shipbuilding Corporation's (CSSC) logo at least on the port side of the exhaust stack structure and what may be the ship's name – 'Zhong Chuan Zi Hao' – in Latin script with Chinese characters above it on the side of the hull at the bow. There are no obvious military-style markings, such as a hull number. The flattop was built at Guangzhou Shipyard International's (GSI) facilities on Longxue Island, just southeast of the city of Guangzhou.

Satellite imagery from Planet Labs that TWZ previously reviewed shows construction started sometime after May of this year and the ship was launched sometime between September 10 and October 9.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION The ship's purpose and who its expected operator might be remain murky. As TWZ previously wrote: 'A new class of light aircraft carrier, amphibious assault ship, or even a sea base-type vessel could offer the PLAN valuable additional operational capacity. A simpler design built more to commercial standards, and with an air component centered on crewed helicopters and drones, could also make a lot of sense for supporting certain missions. This might include presence operations, particularly in and around the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. Such a ship could be useful for supporting anti-submarine warfare and amphibious operations, too.' 'Just being able to build these ships at an additional shipyard could help the PLAN further accelerate its expansion of naval aviation and other capabilities.' 'At the same time, there may also be another uniquely Chinese explanation behind the appearance of the new vessel with its large flight deck in Guangzhou. Since at least 2022, a screenshot said to be from a Chinese government tender has been floating around the internet. A machine translation of its Chinese-language text shows a call for a 'large-scale special deck operation' ship for maritime survey and other test/research activities with some kind of flight deck featuring a 'double-island superstructure.' There is also a demand for a 'through-type straight deck' and a 'dock compartment' at the stern, which could refer to a floodable well deck like those found on many amphibious warfare ships. Stated requirements include that the vessel be 200 meters long, have a flight deck 25 meters wide, have a displacement of 15,000 tons, be capable of hitting a top speed of at least 16 knots, have a range of 5,000 nautical miles at a cruising speed of 12 knots, and a maximum at-sea endurance of 40 days.' &#8230; 'A non-military vessel configured like an amphibious assault ship – something no country in the world currently operates – would be able to employ aerial drones and crewed helicopters, and watercraft (crewed and uncrewed) to conduct scientific or other civilian missions. At the same time, it would inherently be capable of serving as a dual-use platform to support military missions like those previously described if called upon.'

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION There is also still the possibility that the mystery flattop could be some kind of bespoke training, test, and/or demonstration platform, which CSSC could also use to help prove out other future designs. With the curious 'carrier' now at sea, more details about its design and purpose may begin to emerge. Indications so far point to something unique found nowhere else in the world.

Ukraine’s Top Commander Wants New Counteroffensive, Says It’s The...	A new counteroffensive is the only way forward to success for Ukraine, the commander of its Armed Forces recently told a small group of milbloggers. 'Victory is impossible if the Armed Forces work only in defense,' said Col.-Gen. Oleksander Syrskyi, according to Ukrainian military journalist Kirill Sazonov's recent post on Telegram. 'We have to seize the initiative and counterattack. We have and we will. Where and who - you will see.' 'Victory is impossible if the Armed Forces of Ukraine work only in defense. We must seize the initiative and counterattack. We must and we will. Where and who - you will see,' said Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Syrsky. pic.twitter.com/aeFXVQSzkD&mdash; MilitaryNewsUA (@front_ukrainian) November 26, 2024 Sazonov said the details of a future counteroffensive will remain off the record for security purposes. However, he pointed to the successful Ukrainian counteroffensives of the past in Kharkiv and Kherson oblasts as examples. 'It was the encirclement of the enemy, the attack on the flanks and the cutting of logistical routes that brought success to the Armed Forces,' he explained. 'The liberation of Kharkiv Oblast, the liberation of Kherson - exactly according to this logic.' Syrskyi's conversation came as Ukraine’s defenses are crumbling in the east and its salient in Russia’s Kursk Oblast is being chewed up every day in that country’s massive counteroffensive. Defending its eastern region of Donetsk poses the greatest challenge for Ukraine. In particular, Syrskyi explained that the situation in Pokrovsk and Kurahkove 'is difficult' but 'better than it was a week ago' when it was 'critical,' Sazonov stated. 'Some units withdrew, left their positions, and there was no one to close them. A crisis situation indeed. But the issue has been resolved, the reserves have been deployed, the enemy's plans have been thwarted.' Smoke rises from a fire at a house in the middle of the city, approximately 10 km from the frontline in Pokrovsk. (Photo by Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images) Libkos Though Russian troops outnumbered Ukrainian forces by a 5-1 ratio near Pokrovsk, huge losses as the result of so-called meat waves mitigated Moscow's mobilization efforts, Sazonov explained. 'The enemy is already experiencing a lack of reserves and does not have time to replenish units after losses,' Saznozov postulated. 'If earlier the armored vehicle carried 8 to 10 paratroopers on board, now it carries three. The enemy command did not expect such losses. And they have no other tactics.' A recent report by the Institute for the Study of War backs up that contention, noting that Ukraine's fierce defense of Pokrovsk has forced Russia to change its approach. Ukraine too is changing tactics. 'The structure of the armed forces will change,' Saznozov suggested. 'Too costly and inefficient options were rejected. The new structure will be flexible and adaptive, which will allow effective management and will remove unnecessary links in the structure.' Syrskyi’s talk about a new counteroffensive appears to gloss over one of Ukraine’s biggest problems - the lack of sufficient personnel to mount future attacks. 'Ukraine’s problems, meanwhile, are worsening mainly because of manpower issues,' The Economist recently reported. 'The army is long out of willing recruits, and its mobilization campaign is falling short, recruiting barely two-thirds of its target.' One senior Ukrainian official told the publication he is worried the situation may become irretrievable by the spring. 'An even bigger problem is the quality of the new recruits,' the publication posited. '‘Forest,' a battalion commander with the 65th brigade, says the men being sent from army headquarters are now mostly too old or unmotivated to be useful. All but a handful are over the age of 45. 'I’m being sent guys, 50 plus, with doctors’ notes telling me they are too ill to serve,' he says.' 'Ukraine’s problems, meanwhile, are worsening mainly because of manpower issues.

With less than two months in office left, the Biden administration has recently ramped up its support for Ukraine, in particular allowing it to use donated weapons like U.S.-produced Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) short-range ballistic missiles deep inside Russia. The feeling in the current White House has been that a new Trump administration might cut off aid, leaving Ukraine hanging. Trump has promised to end the war quickly, without providing details, as we previously noted. Some on his transition team have suggested a plan that freezes the lines where they are on Jan. 20, adding pressure to Ukraine’s bid control and regain territory. However, Trump’s counterterrorism advisor nominee Seb Gorka recently shed some light on how the new administration's approach could offer Ukraine hope, given the unlikelihood of Russian President Vladimir Putin agreeing to a ceasefire. Trump 'will say to that murderous former KGB colonel, that thug who runs the Russian Federation, you will negotiate now, or the aid that we have given to Ukraine thus far will look like peanuts,' Gorka said. 'That's how he will force those gentlemen, to come to an arrangement that stops the bloodshed.' Whether Gorka's comments truly reflect Trump's thinking remains to be seen. Trump’s newly appointed counterterrorism adviser Sebastian Gorka calls Putin a 'thug' and says Trump plans to end the Ukraine war by threatening to flood Ukraine with military aid, making current U.S. support look like 'peanuts' pic.twitter.com/jKkfmmzvoK&mdash; jeremy scahill (@jeremyscahill) November 25, 2024 What will happen to Ukraine after Trump takes the oath of office is unknown. While European leaders have vowed to fill whatever gaps in military aid might be created by a potential U.S. pullback, nothing is guaranteed. So as much as Syrskyi would like to live up to the old football axiom that the best defense is a good offense, resource constraints and a change in political winds may make that impossible to pull off. The Latest On the battlefield, Russia continues to advance across wide swaths of the battlefield, especially in western Donetsk Oblast in the country’s eastern region. Here are the key takeaways from the Institute for the Study of War’s latest assessment. Russian forces continue to make significant tactical advances in western Donetsk Oblast and are coming closer to enveloping Velyka Novosilka and advancing towards important Ukrainian ground lines of communication (GLOCs) supplying the rest of western Donetsk Oblast and running into eastern Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhia oblasts. Russian advances in western Donetsk Oblast may become operationally significant if the Russian command properly exploits these recent tactical successes, which is not a given. Russian advances in western Donetsk Oblast do not automatically portend the collapse of the Ukrainian frontline. Ukrainian military officials continue to warn of potential Russian ground operations against Zaporizhzhia City, though the timeline and scale of this offensive operation remain unclear due to the operational constraints imposed by ongoing Russian operations in Kursk and Donetsk oblasts. Russian forces recently advanced in southwestern Toretsk and south and southeast of Pokrovsk. NEW: Russian forces continue to make significant tactical advances in western Donetsk Oblast.

The Russian BPLA_Inform Telegram channel published photos of one of them. As we previously reported, Disruptor is part of a secretive family of drones made by the AEVEX company called Phoenix Ghost. The system was first developed for the U.S. Air Force and supplied to Ukraine in its ongoing fight against Russia. AEVEX and U.S. military officials repeatedly declined comment and were unwilling to share images or videos of the drones. However, AEVEX finally publicly unveiled the weapons in October during the annual Association of the U.S. Army conference in Washington D.C. You can read more about them in our deep dive here. The Disruptor was a mystery to Russians as well until recently. 'I first learned about this UAV at the beginning of this year,' BLPA_Inform wrote. 'A channel subscriber sent a video in which a sapper examines an unknown UAV and then destroys it. This was the first evidence of the use of this device. I had never seen anything like this before. It was later, only in the summer of 2024, that videos and photos of similar devices began to appear. And as always, it was not clear where this ‘pipe plane’ came from. But now everything has become clear, and we have to study it.'

A PTKM-1R is engaged after its acoustic and seismic sensors detect an approaching tank from upwards of 200 meters (nearly 660 feet). A submunition then 'jumps' up, with two rocket motors spinning it rapidly, allowing infrared and radar sensors to search for the target. Once the target is located, the submunition descends in a top attack, its high-explosive, shaped charge able to penetrate the thinner layer of protection.

The new training regimen will now last 45 days, instead of the previous 30, according to the Land Forces of Ukraine 'This will make it possible to increase the number of practical classes and update the training program in accordance with current challenges,' it stated. You can see the training unfold in the following video. FPV drones, now a go-to weapon in Russia’s all-out war on Ukraine, are swift, deadly, and operated by VR goggle-wearing pilots. They blow up tanks, chase down troops, and cause widespread mayhem for both sides. So it is only natural that there is a movie in the works glorifying FPV drones and those who fly them. 'Ghosts of the Sky,' is a Russian film 'based on real events about a secret unit of FPV drone operators,' according to the Russian Project Archangel Telegram channel. 'Forget everything you know about combat,' Project Archangel gushes. 'For the first time on screen, breathtaking footage from drone cameras will show the unpredictability and dynamics of combat with unprecedented accuracy.' The film's plot revolves around 'an elite squad of the best FPV drone pilots.' 'They carry out particularly dangerous missions, where the success of the operation depends on their skills and composure,' Project Archangel continued. 'The plot centers on a complex and multi-stage mission to rescue hostages captured deep in enemy territory. The squad must penetrate a dense network of defenses and rescue the hostages using only their drones and the highest professionalism.' This was just a matter of time - Russia is filming an 'action movie' about a Russian FPV unit that is 'based on real events.' The film will show 'in great detail' how FPV drone units operate - in this case, to 'rescue hostages deep within enemy territory.' pic.twitter.com/OA9n4XNIzb&mdash; Samuel Bendett (@sambendett) November 25, 2024 Evoking the symbolism of Ukraine's national flower, the following video shows a Ukrainian Army Aviation Mi-24P Hind helicopter gunship operating from a forward airstrip in a sunflower field during the summer.

An-2 Biplane Caused Major Scare When Russians Thought It Was A Lo...	Videos purporting to show a Ukrainian drone attack on a Russian oil refinery may actually have been of a wayward civilian An-2 biplane. Whatever the exact circumstances were, the incident highlights the continued utility of the anachronistic, but venerable An-2, with or without a pilot. Clips, seen below, showing what looks to be an An-2 passing very low over an oil refinery in the city of Salavat in Russia's Bashkortostan region, as well as anti-aircraft guns firing at it, first began circulating on social media earlier today. Drone attack on Russian oil refinery in Salavat, Bashkortostan, region of Russia is reported. 1300km from the frontline. UPD. False alarm. As it is now reported, a civilian An-2 flew into a restricted area over the oil refinery and was fired upon by Russian air defense. pic.twitter.com/wn6PS5OuqI&mdash; Special Kherson Cat (@bayraktar_1love) November 26, 2024 The plane seen in the videos has a wing configuration and overall shape that align with the An-2, also known by its NATO reporting name Colt, and what sounds like a radial piston engine can be heard in some of the footage. It is possible that it is another biplane type, such as a crop duster, but An-2s are still in use in Russia for commercial and military purposes. Two Russian An-2s seen flying together in 2012. Artem Katranzhi/Wikimedia Commons While what exactly led the apparent An-2 to pass over Salavat remains unknown, that it was initially identified as a drone is not surprising. Salavat is around 720 miles (close to 1,160 kilometers), at closest, from the border with Ukraine, and some 808 miles (approximately 1,300 kilometers) from the front lines of the fighting in that country. However, Ukraine has demonstrated its ability to launch very long-range attacks with kamikaze drones, including ones converted from crewed aircraft, against targets hundreds of miles inside Russian territory, including in the capital Moscow. Russian facilities related to oil and natural gas production have also been especially prime targets for Ukrainian drones. WIth ample space inside for additional range-extending fuel and explosives, the An-2 could be a good candidate for conversion into a one-way attacker. A map showing the general location of the city of Salavat in Russia's Bashkortostan region. Google Maps The idea of repurposing An-2s, an aircraft that Antonov first began producing in 1947 in what was then Soviet Ukraine, as weaponized drones is not new, either. During its war with Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh region in 2020, Azerbaijan employed the biplanes with certain modifications as semi-uncrewed decoys. Pilots would get the aircraft aloft and locked onto a set course before bailing out. The planes would then fly along that route until they were shot down, ran out of fuel, or otherwise crashed. This, in turn, created complications for Armenian air defenders who had to try to determine if the Colts were real kamikaze drones and make the decision about whether or not to expend valuable anti-aircraft resources to try to knock them out. Engaging the pilotless biplanes would also expose air defense positions and give Azerbaijan's forces other opportunities to glean information about Armenia's capabilities and standard operating procedures. The video below reportedly shows Armenian air defenses shooting down an Azerbaijani An-2. In March 2022, soon after Russia launched its all-out invasion of Ukraine, signs emerged that it was massing An-2s, possibly to employ them in a similar fashion to how Azerbaijan used them against Armenia. There are no clear indications that Russian forces subsequently employed those aircraft in any configuration in relation to the conflict in Ukraine. Examples of the Y-5, a version of the An-2 built under license in China, have also been more recently adapted into uncrewed cargo-carrying platforms, ostensibly for civilian use, but with potential military applications. Even when employed in its intended role as a crewed light transport plane, the An-2 continues to be relevant in a military context, as TWZ has highlighted on multiple occasions in the past. With its metal-framed, but fabric-covered wings, the biplane has a relatively small radar cross section for its size. It can fly extremely slow and low, helping further to evade detection, even in certain circumstances by aircraft high above with look-down-shoot-down radars. The plane has impressive short takeoff and landing capabilities, as well. For these reasons, North Korea notably maintains a fleet of An-2s to help deposit commandos behind enemy lines, either by parachute or after landing on short stretches of fields or highways, during the opening stages of conflict on the Peninsula. South Korea has its own An-2s to help its forces train against those threats. North Korean An-2s drop commandos during training. North Korean State Media One of South Korea's An-2s.

An An-2 belonging to the air force of Latvia, a NATO member. Latvian Armed Forces There continue to be attempts to iterate on and improve upon the An-2's design, but no such effort has been met with the same kind of success. Whether or not more details emerge about the An-2 flight over Salavat, the videos highlight the staying power of the rugged, if increasingly ancient-looking design, crewed or uncrewed, including in military service.

The German Navy already uses the Mk 41 VLS on most of its frigate classes and the system is widely used across NATO and allied navies. However, the fact that Germany has already ordered the Mk 41-compatible Kongsberg Naval Strike Missile (NSM) as its future anti-ship and land-attack missile suggests that MBDA may be primarily pitching the naval RCM² to other customers. RCM² remote carriers are air-launched from an A400M in this rendering. MBDA The next image shows multiple examples of the RCM² dropped from the rear ramp of an Airbus A400M military transport. Using transport aircraft to drop standoff munitions is a growing area of interest right now, underlined by the U.S. Air Force’s Rapid Dragon air-launched palletized munitions concept. It’s also noteworthy that Airbus has already conducted some experimental trials involving the release of what it described as a 'remote carrier flight test demonstrator.' A remote carrier demonstrator, a modified Airbus Do-DT25 drone, is launched from the rear ramp of a German A400M. Airbus Finally, an RCM² is shown being launched by a tracked mobile ground launcher, apparently an M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS), which can fire 227mm artillery rockets, as well as Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) short-range ballistic missiles. In this rendering, seen at the top of this story, the M270 is shown with a mixed payload of artillery rockets and RCM² remote carriers. This would also provide compatibility with the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS. As its name indicates, the RCM² is intended to be used for missions in addition to standoff strike, as would be expected of a traditional cruise missile. Although it can carry a warhead for kinetic attacks, it can also accommodate an electronic warfare payload to deny the enemy’s use of the electromagnetic spectrum. In this way, it will provide jamming and operate as a decoy to support other remote carriers or different platforms. Beyond that, the RCM² is also planned to operate within what MBDA described as an 'order-based effector network,' in which control of the remote carrier — or even swarms of them — can be handed over to any operator with access to that same network. The RCM² is also billed as being particularly relevant for use in highly contested and well-defended areas, with a combination of low-observable design features and can be used in GPS-denied environments, something that is a growing concern now, based on lessons from the war in Ukraine. As well as GPS guidance, the RCM² will have an inertial navigation system (INS), a terrain contour matching (TERCOM) system, and an imaging infrared (IIR) seeker. The remote carrier also will have a loitering capability, meaning it can be re-targeted in flight, to attack time-sensitive ‘pop-up’ targets, for example. Later versions of the RCM² are planned to add a reconnaissance capability, with sensors added to acquire targeting data and provide real-time situational awareness. Specifications released by MBDA at ILA 2024 include a length of 13 feet, a weight of 750 pounds without the launch booster, and a range of more than 310 miles. The remote carrier looks very much like a standoff missile, with some low observable shaping and a faceted nose, including windows for the IIR sensors. A pair of pop-out wings are fitted above the body and the tail surfaces are very much aircraft-like, with a pair of vertical tailfins and a pair of horizontal stabilizers. Conformal intakes on either side of the body would appear to feed an air-breathing turbofan or turbojet engine. While the RCM² is now being very clearly pitched as a ‘platform agnostic’ system, more broadly, remote carriers have been seen as a critical adjunct to the pan-European Future Combat Air System (FCAS) next-generation air combat program, which includes the crewed New Generation Fighters (NGF), as well as for the in-service Eurofighter Typhoon. An Airbus graphic shows an NGF working alongside various remote carriers. Airbus The Airbus vision for FCAS includes remote carriers being launched by larger transport aircraft ‘motherships,’ with types such as the A400M bringing up to 50 small or as many as 12 heavy remote carriers 'as close as possible to their areas of operation before releasing.' Under the FCAS initiative, remote carriers of different sizes and capabilities will work alongside crewed combat aircraft — and also independently — acting as complementary sensors, effectors, decision-making nodes, and cruise missiles. The published specifications for the RCM² would appear to put it into broadly the same light remote carrier category as the FEANIX, from German contractor Diehl Defense, which was also unveiled at ILA 2024. According to Diehl, the FEANIX will be less than 13 feet long (perhaps even less than 11.5 feet long) and will weigh less than 660 pounds. A full-size FEANIX mockup presented at ILA Berlin in July 2024. Thomas Newdick Thomas Newdick What’s most notable about the RCM² is the fact that it’s intended, from the outset, to carry a range of different payloads, with its modular nature lending it to a number of mission sets. At the same time, the option to launch the RCM² from a range of different platforms is a significant advantage, meaning that a single remote carrier type can be acquired for various launch platforms and across different services. While MBDA has not discussed this aspect in much detail so far, remote carriers of this size are, by their nature, intended to be disposal stores. This means that, even when accommodating non-kinetic payloads, they are not expected to be recovered after their missions and reused. In this way, remote carriers can be used in large numbers, boosting ‘combat mass,’ something that will require them to be affordable. Again, at this point, we don’t know the kind of price tag that the RCM² will come with. It’s unclear when MBDA expects the RCM² to be ready for service, but the rival FEANIX is expected to become operational 'well before the FCAS realization period of 2040+,' according to Diehl, suggesting this could be in service in the 2030s. Even before the FCAS arrives, Airbus wants to introduce what it calls 'first-generation' remote carriers with the Eurofighter Typhoon as part of the manned-unmanned teaming component of the Long-Term Evolution (LTE) — a modernization program for the fighter. A graphic depicting Typhoon fighters working together with heavy and light remote carrier drones. One of the heavy remote carriers is seen at the left releasing examples of the light type. Airbus As well as air-launched applications, the fact that the RCM² (like the FEANIX) can be launched from land and sea platforms, using existing vertical launch systems, is significant, especially as land forces and navies increasingly look to field longer-range missiles that can attack targets both on land and at sea. In both cases, this would require the RCM² to be fitted with the additional booster that’s shown in the relevant renderings. The appearance of the RCM² is also timely in view of Russia’s extensive use of ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles against Ukraine, which has lighted a major gap in the inventories of many European NATO countries. Faced with this ‘standoff missile gap,’ France, Germany, Italy, and Poland launched the European Long-Range Strike Approach (ELSA) this summer — Sweden and the United Kingdom both subsequently joined. This effort calls for the development of a new capability for 'long-range strikes,' although the type of weapon being pursued is not mentioned. It’s not unlikely that ELSA will eventually lead to different types of missiles being procured and the RCM² could be a contender for parts of the requirement, with the added benefit that it can be used for non-kinetic roles, too.

Photo by ROBERTO SCHMIDT / AFP ROBERTO SCHMIDT Ultimately, it seems that ELSA will seek to provide a weapon with a range of between 621 and 1,243 miles, which would rule out the RCM², but even as a ground-launched standoff weapon, the RCM² could still provide NATO in Europe with a very important capability. After all, currently, only Turkey possesses a conventional ground-launched missile with a range of more than 186 miles — the indigenously developed Bora short-range ballistic missile. This is in stark contrast to Russia, which has various ground-launched systems with this kind of performance, able to carry conventional or nuclear warheads. A 9M728 ground-launched cruise missile is fired from a Russian Iskander system. Russian Ministry of Defense www.twz.com ‘No European NATO member except for Turkiye possesses a conventional ground-launched missile with a range greater than 300 km.'@Wright_T_J discusses filling this capability gap, where Russia has a distinct advantage. pic.twitter.com/ekUtqrtEQ1&mdash; IISS News (@IISS_org) November 25, 2024 What the RCM² and other similar remote carrier proposals lack in range, they make up for in terms of flexibility and versatility. In many ways, they blur the boundaries between existing standoff munitions and drones, able to deliver lethal or non-lethal effects at long distances, while at the same time ‘outsourcing’ functions and capabilities that would be too much for a human pilot to handle or which would expose that pilot to too great a risk. Again, while we don’t know how much the RCM² is likely to cost, it clearly aligns with a growing focus on attritable or at least lower-cost air systems — especially ones that can work alongside crewed fighters. A ‘cheap’ long-range cruise missile-like design similar to that which the U.S. Air Force is also eyeing would very likely be of interest to various operators, especially when that same system can also be used to perform a range of other complementary missions and to do so when launched from platforms in the air, at sea, or on the ground.

Submarine Presence In Guam Gets Boost With Its First Forward-Base...	The U.S. military’s plans to build up its forces on the island of Guam received some added firepower Tuesday with the arrival of the Virginia class attack submarine USS Minnesota (SSN-783), the first of its class to be forward-based at the United States' vital outpost in the Western Pacific. Billed as part of the Navy’s 'strategic laydown plan for naval forces in the Indo-Pacific region,' the Minnesota will fall under the command of Submarine Squadron 15, which is currently comprised of the Los Angeles-class submarines USS Annapolis, USS Asheville, USS Jefferson City and USS Springfield, elder boats that were all commissioned in the early 1990s. Minnesota – which had been based at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam since 2022 – has the ability to take on anti-submarine, anti-surface and strike warfare, along with intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. It will bolster what is a rapidly expanding array of U.S. military offensive and defensive capabilities on the 30-mile-long, nine-mile-wide island. 'The security environment in the Indo-Pacific requires that the U.S. Navy station the most capable units forward,' the sea service said in a statement announcing Minnesota’s new home port. 'This posture allows flexibility for maritime and joint force operations, with forward-deployed units ready to rapidly respond to deter aggression and promote a peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific region.' The Virginia-class attack submarine Minnesota arrives at its new home in Guam. (U.S. Navy) Petty Officer 1st Class Justin Wolpert The boat will certainly bring fresh capability to the island's submarine roster. In addition to its 12 individual Vertical Launch System (VLS) tubes that pack Tomahawk cruise missiles, as well as the ability to employ dozens of torpedoes, Virginia-class submarines can support special operations missions. The Virginia class also features a ‘fly-by-wire’ control system that makes it easier to handle the submarine in shallow water and other complex littoral environments. This is especially advantageous for operating in areas like the South China Sea. Minnesota’s home port shift to Guam 'adds a next-generation attack submarine with advanced capabilities to the forward-deployed naval force,' Lt. Cmdr. Rick Moore, a Submarine Force Pacific spokesperson, told TWZ Tuesday. The arrival of the 11-year-old Minnesota also provides another real-world signal of the workhorse Los Angeles class fast-attack fleet’s continuing retirement, as more Virginia class submarines come online to replace those aging boats. The Virginia-class attack submarine Minnesota returns to Groton, Connecticut, in 2021 after deployment. (U.S. Navy) Chief Petty Officer Joshua Karsten There are now 23 Virginia-class submarines on active duty, one more than the current 22 in the Los Angeles fleet, Navy officials told TWZ. While Virginia class submarines operate throughout the Pacific, having one permanently stationed at Guam, with the infrastructure to support that basing, means that the Navy will be able to better sustain the class’s operations from there. This development could play a role in the trilateral agreement between the U.S., U.K. and Australia – known as AUKUS – to eventually get Canberra Virginia class subs of its own. Guam is also already serving as a hub for submarine activity, as well as some maintenance and repair work. For instance, when the Seawolf class submarine Connecticut struck a seamount while operating in the South China Sea in October 2021, it made a prolonged emergency stop in Guam before heading to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Washington state. The Seawolf-class attack submarine Connecticut undergoes repairs following its collision with a seamount in 2021. (U.S. Navy) USN The Minnesota’s home port shift comes as debate has resurfaced about arming the Virginia class fleet with nuclear cruise missiles. As TWZ reported last week, supporters of the Sea-Launched Cruise Missile (SLCM-N) program argue that it will give the president another nuclear response option against adversaries, while detractors contend that the program is a waste of finite Navy resources. President-elect Donald Trump began the program in 2018, and it was marginalized by the Biden White House, even as Congress continued to fund the effort and the Navy proceeded. Whether the effort will receive extra focus after Trump is inaugurated remains to be seen. Still, the inclusion of SLCM-N could give forward-deployed Virginia class boats a much greater strategic weight that is simply not a factor now. They would also pose a far greater risk to the enemy and would be prioritized even higher for targeting. And as the Minnesota gives INDOPACOM greater Guam-based undersea capabilities, the island is also shaping up to become the most heavily defended piece of turf on the planet in the coming years. Among those initiatives, TWZ reported in October that the military had released images of a Mk 41 vertical launch system (VLS) for the Aegis Ashore air defense system that had been installed there. Those land-based launchers are part of a broader effort to shore up the defenses of U.S. military bases, particularly when it comes to an attack from China, which has directly referenced such a scenario should full-blown war break out in the region. In addition to Naval Base Guam, the island hosts Andersen Air Force Base and Marine Corps Base Camp Blaz, which is taking on Marines from Okinawa. We likely won’t ever learn much about what missions the Minnesota undertakes while stationed in Guam. The so-called 'silent service' isn’t big on public disclosure. But the submarine’s basing in the West Pacific undeniably offers another arrow in INDOPACOM’s quiver, and signals the importance the island and its assets will play should war with China erupt.

Russia Launched The Largest Drone Attack On Ukraine Of The War	Russia launched overnight what officials in Kyiv have described as the biggest drone raid on Ukrainian territory since the start of the conflict. Only hours later, Moscow said it was preparing 'retaliatory actions' after Ukraine again used U.S.-donated Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) short-range ballistic missiles to strike targets within Russia’s borders. You can read our initial report on the latest use of ATACMS to attack targets within Russia here. Kremlin officials say that Ukraine has now used ATACMS to strike targets within Russia twice in the last three days. Russia claims that, on both occasions, Ukraine attempted to hit air defense systems in the Kursk region. While Russia says that one or two missiles reached their targets, most were shot down. Still, this was a rare admission by Moscow that Ukrainian strikes of any kind had successfully hit their targets. Russian Defense Ministry confirms Ukrainian strikes with ATACMS missiles on the S-400 air defense position near Bolshoye Zhirovo in Kursk Oblast on November 23.The Russian side says that three ATACMS missiles were intercepted during the attack, while two reached its target.… pic.twitter.com/MGYp7v5kJF&mdash; Status-6 (Military & Conflict News) (BlueSky too) (@Archer83Able) November 26, 2024 The first of these targets appears to have been an S-400 long-range surface-to-air missile battery near the village of Bolshoe Zhirovo, on November 23, while the second was the airfield at Khalino, also hosting air defense systems, which was struck yesterday morning. Khalino airfield is around 60 miles from the Ukrainian border, while Bolshoe Zhirovo is around 20 miles farther northwest. Satellite imagery of Khalino obtained by TWZ is inconclusive as to what damage was inflicted on the base. Photos published on social media by unofficial Russian sources show the wreckage of one of the missiles in the aftermath of the ATACMS strike on Kursk-Khalino Air Base, as well as a Pantsir short-range air defense system in an elevated location in the background, as seen at the top of this article.

It’s unclear what kind of retaliatory measures Russia now has in mind, but overnight it already subjected Ukraine to what appears to have been an unprecedented series of strikes involving long-range one-way attack drones. According to the Ukrainian Air Force, the Russian strikes overnight involved 188 drones. Of these, the service claims its air defenses shot down 76, while it lost track of 96, which it claims was likely as a result of electronic warfare measures. Another five drones were noted headed toward Belarus, the Ukrainian Air Force said, presumably after guidance malfunctions. Last night, Russia attacked Ukraine, launching a record number of strike drones—188—against our people. I want to thank our defenders of the sky for repelling the attack.

An example of a Gerbera drone, which came down overnight in the Sumy region of Ukraine.

'Unfortunately, there were hits to critical infrastructure facilities, and private and apartment buildings were damaged in several regions due to the massive drone attack,' the Ukrainian Air Force said, adding that no casualties had been reported.

The Ternopil region also saw disruption to water and heat supplies, with local authorities reportedly gearing up for planned power cuts. In the Kyiv region, damage to four private residences, two high-rise apartment buildings, and other infrastructure was blamed on falling debris. Regional governor Ruslan Kravchenko said that local air defenses brought down more than 10 Russian drones.

In the last two winters, Russia has also specifically launched attacks on critical infrastructure in an effort to cause maximum disruption and break Ukrainian resolve. Indeed, almost exactly a year ago, Russia launched what Ukrainian officials described at the time as the largest drone attack on their country so far, involving a reported 75 one-way attack drones. These were mainly launched against Kyiv and the surrounding region. Record number of drones launched by Russia into Ukraine tonight—188. They’re also rapidly advancing drone tech, making them deadlier and ramping up production to hundreds per week.

Thanks to its Iranian-designed one-way attack drones, Russia has a much cheaper means of keeping up a relentless assault on Ukrainian targets far beyond the front lines, compared to the ballistic missiles and cruise missiles that were used at the beginning of the campaign and then more sporadically as time passed. With the production of Shahed-type drones now also underway in Russia, there is also a more immediate source of these weapons. A view inside a Russian factory building Shahed-type drones, under the local name Geran, and understood to be in Yelabuga, in Russia’s southeastern Tatarstan region. via X This winter, the drone attacks also coincide with a major push by Russian forces along the front lines in eastern Ukraine. This has led to some of the most significant Russian territorial gains since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022, as you can read about here. At the same time, Ukraine has also kept up the tempo of its own long-range drone strikes on Russian territory. There’s also the backdrop of uncertainty around how the course of the war might change once Donald Trump takes office in January. The potential implications of this are something we have also examined in depth. As for Ukraine’s ATACMS strikes, these were approved on targets deep within Russia earlier this month, primarily in support of the Kursk offensive, which is now facing a major Russian counterattack, which also involves North Korean troops. As well as ATACMS, Ukraine has now received permission to use British-supplied Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missiles to strike targets deep in Russia. Permission to use the French-supplied SCALP EG, otherwise identical to the Storm Shadow, had previously been granted. A Storm Shadow missile under the wing of a Ukrainian Su-24 strike aircraft. Ukrainian Air Force screencap Ukrainian Air Force Today, Bloomberg reported that the United Kingdom had recently sent 'dozens' more Storm Shadow missiles to Ukraine, although the U.K. Ministry of Defense has so far not commented on this. While Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has made very clear his anger over these decisions from two of Ukraine’s Western allies, the Russian Ministry of Defense has so far only stated that 'retaliatory actions are being prepared.' It remains to be seen what form these will take, but Russia has already employed an experimental ballistic missile against the Ukrainian city of Dnipro last week, a response to the first use of ATACMS on Russian territory. You can read our initial analysis of this unprecedented event here, as well as our analysis of the intermediate-range ballistic missile of which a variant was likely used.

Moscow has also warned that the use of Western-supplied long-range missiles by Ukraine against Russia could trigger a nuclear response after Russian nuclear war plans were updated. Increasingly, however, there are signs that Russia and Ukraine might now be engaged in something of a new phase of the conflict, with tit-for-tat missile strikes across their respective territories, using longer-range and ever more capable weapons. However, with Trump less than two months from taking office, it remains to be seen just how much further this will escalate.

British Troops Reinforce USAF Airbases Amid Mysterious Drone Incu...	Approximately 60 members of the British armed forces have reportedly deployed across three air bases in the United Kingdom that host American forces in response to ongoing drone incidents. Nearly a week ago, mysterious drone incursions began over RAF Lakenheath, the U.S. Air Force's main fighter hub in the country, which TWZ was first to report. It subsequently emerged that other bases had been experiencing concerning activity by still unidentified uncrewed aerial systems at the same time. The Times newspaper in the United Kingdom was among the first to report on the reinforcements sent to RAF Lakenheath, as well as RAF Mildenhall and RAF Feltwell, citing anonymous sources. RAF Lakenheath, as well as RAF Mildenhall and RAF Feltwell, had experienced drone incursions between November 20 and 22. Lakenheath and Mildenhall, at least, also then saw similar drone activity yesterday. All three facilities are situated in eastern England. The 48th Fighter Wing, with its F-35A Joint Strike Fighters and F-15E Strike Eagles, and the 100th Air Refueling Wing, which flies KC-135s, are the main units at Lakenheath and Mildenhall respectively. There have also been signs that Lakenheath is at least being prepared to re-host U.S. nuclear bombs after those weapons were removed from the country in 2008. Feltwell also houses personnel from the 48th Fighter Wing and serves as an additional logistical node for American forces in the country. A US Air Force F-35A lands at RAF Lakenheath. USAF 'A military source &#8230; confirmed that the RAF had offered the US a counter-drone system that can electronically take command of an enemy drone and turn it back on itself to try to identify those flying the drones,' according to The Times newspaper in the United Kingdom, though it is unclear if the capability or others have actually been deployed. 'The 'Ninja' — 'negation of improvised non-state joint aerial-threats' — is a counter-drone system able to identify targets up to 7km [approximately 4.3 miles] away,' The Times' story adds without confirming whether this could be among the counter-drone capabilities on offer. 'When the hostile drone gets closer, the system overrides the command system and sends new instructions, according to the defense firm Leonardo.' NINJA was originally developed for the U.S. Air Force and subsequently became part of the Royal Air Force ORCUS counter-drone system, which also includes a counter-drone electronic warfare jamming system called Guardian and various sensors. A graphic showing elements of the RAF's Orcus counter-drone suite. Crown copyright 'We take threats seriously and maintain robust measures at defense sites. We are supporting the US Air Force response,' the U.K. Ministry of Defense told The War Zone when asked for more information. 'We are not offering detail on numbers, locations or equipment.' 'We employ multi-layered and credible force protection measures, we will not go into specifics and it would be inappropriate to comment further on operational security matters, however, we can confirm we are working closely with USVF [U.S. Visiting Force], Police and other partners to respond to recent events,' the U.K. Ministry of Defense had also told TWZ yesterday. 'Small unmanned aerial systems continue to be spotted in the vicinity of and over Royal Air Force Lakenheath, RAF Mildenhall, RAF Feltwell and RAF Fairford since Nov. 20,' U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), the service's top command in the region, said in an update to its press release on the ongoing situation today. 'To date, installation leaders have determined that none of the incursions impacted base residents, facilities or assets. The Air Force is taking all appropriate measures to safeguard the aforementioned installations and their residents.' 'The number of [uncrewed aerial] systems has fluctuated, and they have ranged in sizes and configurations. Our units continue to monitor the airspace and are working with host-nation authorities and mission partners to ensure the safety of base personnel, facilities and assets,' the release adds. 'To safeguard operational security, we do not discuss specific force protection measures, however we retain the right to protect our installations. We request individuals in the area to contact either local police or Security Forces if they see anything suspicious, to include sUAS's or drone activity.' An aerial view of RAF Lakenheath. David Goddard/Getty Images 'I can confirm the situation is ongoing and our units continue to monitor the airspace and are working with host-nation authorities and mission partners to ensure the safety of base personnel, facilities, and assets,' a USAFE spokesperson had earlier told Sky News. 'To safeguard operational security, we do not discuss specific force protection measures, however we retain the right to protect our installations.' 'We can confirm there were sightings yesterday during night-time hours and can only confirm that the number fluctuated and varied between the bases over the night,' USAFE said as well, according to The Times. 'Since November 20, there has been no impact to residents or infrastructure and they have not been identified as hostile.' 'However, they are still continuously being monitored to ensure the safety and security of the installations.' Who is operating the drones and for what purpose remains unknown. U.S. and U.K. authorities are reportedly investigating whether the activity is part of some kind of larger coordinated operation and who might be responsible. A satellite image of RAF Lakenheath. Google Earth Regardless, the incursions over the three British airbases and the continued drone activity in their vicinity for nearly a week on underscores very real concerns about uncrewed aerial threats to critical military facilities and civilian infrastructure. TWZ has been on the leading edge of covering this topic for years and has broken multiple stories now about drone incursions over key U.S. bases and training ranges, as well as unscrewed aerial systems harassing American forces off the coasts of the United States and making worrisome overflights of important non-military sites. A spate of drone incursions over Langley Air Force Base in Virginia in December 2023, which TWZ was the first report on, has now become a particular national cause celebre. The United Kingdom is no stranger to the still-growing danger posed by drones. Though the exact circumstances remain unclear, reports of unauthorized uncrewed aerial activity paralyzed Gatwick Airport for multiple days in December 2018. Concerning drone incursions, including some potentially tied to Russia, have been reported elsewhere in Europe in recent years. There has been a surge in reports more recently about sabotage plots and other attacks against targets in Europe orchestrated or otherwise fomented by the Russian government. This includes reported fears of a possible drone attack on Geilenkirchen Air Base in Germany, which hosts NATO's fleet of E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft, in August. Since the news about the incursions over Langley broke, other unauthorized drone activity over and around U.S. and allied military bases, as well as options (or the lack thereof) for neutralizing those threats, has been getting greater attention. Domestically, American forces are faced with sometimes confusing and obtuse authorities about when and how they can knock down drones flying over sensitive sites, as you can read more about here. In the meantime, TWZ is continuing to follow the ongoing situation around the three airbases in the United Kingdom closely.

Marine HIMARS Deployment To Southern Japanese Islands During Taiw...	If China invades Taiwan, U.S. Marine Corps units and their High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) would be rushed to southwestern Japanese islands near Taiwan and abutting the East China Sea, while a relatively new U.S. Army unit built in part to stop China from closing off the South China Sea would head to adjacent military bases in the Philippines. That’s the gist of a report in the Japanese press over the weekend that offers a potential glimpse at how two components of U.S. missile forces would be rapidly arrayed to flank China should Beijing move to invade Taiwan. The anonymously sourced Kyodo News report fits with everything we previously understood about U.S. contingency planning in the region. Kyodo’s report states that the missile unit deployment layout will be featured in a joint Taiwan contingency plan that the United States and Japan will finalize next month. It also comes as Tokyo has sought to shed decades of post-World II pacifistic defense military policies in favor of a beefier military budget and a more active role in countering China’s ascendance. If war breaks out, a U.S. Marine littoral regiment and its HIMARS contingent would head to Japanese island chains that abut the East China Sea, according to Kyodo, which does not specify the islands but reports that they are part of the Kagoshima and Okinawa prefectures. Kyodo did not name Marine units, but the 12th Marine Littoral Regiment is based out of nearby Camp Hansen, Okinawa. A U.S. Army-fired High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System. (U.S. Marine Corps) U.S. Marine Corps Marine littoral regiments are a key piece of the service’s Force Design 2030, which seeks to make Marine units more autonomous, self-sufficient and agile should a war in the Pacific occur. Marines have already been using HIMARS during exercises in the region, including in the latest iteration of the Balikatan exercise in the Philippines this past May. HIMARS can fire a single Army Tactical Missile System (ATACM) missile or up to six artillery rockets without reloading. The artillery rockets include the M30/31 Guided Multiple-Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) variety, turning these projectiles into highly-precise rapid strike weapons. GMLRS has a range of around 50 miles, while the much larger and harder-hitting ATACMS can reach out 180 miles. The forthcoming Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) will replace the ATACMs, offering much greater range and eventually anti-ship capabilities, among other critical improvements. Extended Range GMLRS (ER GMLRS) will double the range of the current M30/31 guided rockets as well. 'From an early stage, when a Taiwan contingency becomes highly imminent, temporary bases will be set up on inhabited islands of the island chain, based on U.S. military guidelines for dispatching Marines in small formations to several locations,' Kyodo reported Sunday. Japan’s Self-Defense Forces would largely play a support role, fueling and supplying the Marines, according to the report. Meanwhile, in the South China Sea, U.S. Army Units would deploy long-range fires from a Multi-Domain Task Force, Kyodo reports. That Army unit type was first stood up in 2017 and is tasked with challenging anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) defense from peer adversaries, namely China.

Kyle Chan TWZ laid out what such units entail back in 2021: 'This MDTF is a testbed organization of sorts that is exploring how to integrate various advanced technologies, including new weapons and greatly improved networking capabilities, as well as associated tactics, techniques, and procedures, into future operations, especially against higher-end opponents, such as China or Russia. This unit set to receive the first operational battery equipped with the Army’s future Long Range Hypersonic Weapon, as well as a Mid-Range Capability Battery that could be equipped with land-based SM-6s and Tomahawks, or other weapons, such as Increment 2 PrSMs, depending on how the service proceeds in those development efforts.' While more units of this type are in the works, the 1st Multi-Domain Task Force (MDTF) in particular would likely be tasked with the mission of running things from the Philippines. The first-of-its-kind command is based out of Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington, and is assigned to the Indo-Pacific. Already, a Combined Information and Effects Fusion Cell (CIEFC) assigned to the 1st MDTF has been operating in tandem with the Philippines’ Northern Luzon command, according to the U.S. Army. That cell began working there during Balikatan 23, providing real-time maritime domain awareness. Since then, it has continued to operate out of Camp Aquino, 'increasing bilateral maritime domain awareness and supporting Filipino humanitarian and disaster relief efforts,' the Army said in June. The 1st MDTF is also the only unit sporting a Dark Eagle Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW) battery, the Army says. That weapon is still in testing though.

(U.S. Army) The U.S. Army was busy rotating systems through the Philippines earlier this year. It sent elements of its new Typhoon ground-based missile system there in April. Typhoon can fire SM-6 multi-purpose missiles and Tomahawk cruise missiles, the former of which will work as a quasi-ballistic missile used for land and anti-ship attack strikes. Typhon’s arrival provided a glimpse of what’s to come as the service works to permanently base these systems in China’s backyard, TWZ previously reported. The War Zone was not immediately able to confirm the details in the report, with Japanese officials not responding to requests for comment. A Pentagon spokesperson declined to comment on the article’s accuracy. 'We won’t speculate on what could happen and for operational security reasons, we won’t confirm how the United States would respond,' the spokesperson said. Philippine officials also declined comment. If confirmed, Kyodo’s reporting underscores the importance of the U.S.-Japan alliance, and it reflects the practical manifestations of a 2023 agreement between Washington and Manila to increase the number of bases in the Philippines that American forces can operate from. Under that agreement, the island nation agreed to allow U.S. boots on nine installations, up from five. As the U.S. watches and waits for what China may eventually do regarding Taiwan, the report reinforces the importance of alliances, and that America won't be able to do everything it can if it doesn't have friendly soil from which to operate.

ATACMS Hit Air Field In Russia For The First Time	Ukraine carried out the first attack on an airfield in Russia using U.S.-donated Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) short-range ballistic missiles on Monday. The Khalino airfield about 60 miles from the border was targeted, according to media and Telegram accounts. The attack came as Ukraine struggled to hold territory in the region that it captured during its August invasion. The War Zone obtained satellite imagery from today that doesn't show outright extensive damage at the base, but the photo is partially obscured with key areas not being visible. The presence of any aircraft is also limited, which isn't surprising as the base hasn't been used as a primary operating location for tactical airpower for some time. More on the imagery in a moment. Video and images emerging on social media show explosions of submunitions from an ATACMS cluster variant reportedly striking the airfield. The moment when 5 ATACMS missiles struck the airport of Kursk. There was a Russian S-400 air defense battery present which you can see is even firing in the beginning of the second video, but the US-made missiles mercilessly struck the Russian airport and its red lines. pic.twitter.com/jRKNYiQhX8&mdash; (((Tendar))) (@Tendar) November 25, 2024 Russian airfield in Khalino near Kursk was targeted by ATACMS with cluster submunitions.

Russian monitoring channels report a massive ATACMS missile strike on the Kursk region at night pic.twitter.com/mIMo1cTtN3&mdash; MilitaryNewsUA (@front_ukrainian) November 25, 2024 'Seven ATACMS missiles and 12 UAVs attacked the Kursk region at night,' the independent Russia ASTRA news outlet reported on Telegram Monday. While a number of the missiles were shot down, ASTRA said that at least one struck the Khalino airfield, injuring two troops. In addition, ASTRA claimed a private house was damaged. 'Damage to the airfield is currently unknown,' ASTRA explained. 'Drones were shot down in Zheleznogorsk and Dmitrievsky districts.' 'At night, ATACMS cluster missiles attacked the …Khalino airfield in the Kursk region,' the Russian Military Informant Telegram channel reported. 'The footage of the landing and its geolocation published by Ukrainian channels also shows the characteristic moment of the detonation of M74 submunitions on the territory of the airbase.' Khalino airfield is located about 60 miles from the border with Ukraine. (Google Earth image) Though Russian sources claimed seven of the eight ATACMS were shot down, images posted on social media show 'at least two arrivals,' Military Informant suggested. 'It was immediately obvious that the key targets for the ATACMS would be airfields. At the same time, due to the threat of missile strikes, aviation is practically no longer used from border airfields and has been relocated deeper.' The Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff said targets in Kursk were among several in Russia struck by its forces Monday, but did not specify the target in Kursk or how it was attacked 'On the night of November 25, 2024 units of the Main Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine together with other components of the Defense Forces attacked a number of important occupiers objects, in particular in Bryansk, Kaluzk and Kursk regions of Russia,' the General Staff claimed on Facebook. 'There is confirmation of a successful impact of the oil base in the Kaluz region,' the General Staff claimed. 'The results of combat work on other objects are specified.' The following video reportedly shows that facility under attack. In Kaluga, the oil depot and the Taifut plant were allegedly attacked. pic.twitter.com/oonY4tM8h9&mdash; Malinda (@TreasChest) November 24, 2024 The Russian Defense Ministry claimed that seven drones were shot down over Kursk, but did not specify where. Ukrainian officials have long argued the need for ATACMS to airfields in Russia being used to launch airstrikes. U.S. officials, meanwhile, have argued that Russia moved aviation assets away from airfields in range of ATACMS. 'I don’t believe one capability is going to be decisive and I stand by that comment,' Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has said. On Nov. 17, Ukraine was finally permitted by the Biden administration to use ATACMS in Russia. The weapon was first used two days later, hitting a munitions storage facility near the town of Karachev in the Bryansk region of western Russia about 70 miles from the border. The ATACMS short-range ballistic missiles can hit targets up to about 190 miles away, while earlier variants feature a shorter range. The following video shows that attack underway.

'Reinforced concrete shelters for aviation are being built at an accelerated pace,' at the airfield, Military Informant claimed. Satellite images we obtained appear to confirm that. Below are images taken on November 2nd and today, November 25th, of the airbase. The post attack image is partially obscured and no massive damage is visible, but the air defense systems arrayed between the runway and the taxiway are largely obscured, as well as key areas of the installation. This is especially true for the northwest corner of the base where hardened shelters are being constructed. Image taken on November 2nd, 2024 (PHOTO © 2024 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION) One Russian Telegram channel complained that Ukraine's attack was aided by surveillance cameras in the area that produced the videos previously seen. 'Now I won’t go on and on about how the Ukrainian Armed Forces and their Western masters are playing with fire and all that&#8230; that’s clear to everyone,' the Two Majors Telegram channel groused. 'I want to raise a speech about the STILL WORKING OUTDOOR SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS WITH PUBLIC ACCESS IN THE FRONTLINE CITY. Moreover, some of these cameras look DIRECTLY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE MILITARY AIRFIELD.' 'Should I say that this is a huge help to the enemy in adjusting strikes and objective control?' Two Majors asked rhetorically. 'And how will these shots fly around among the [Ukrainians] as propaganda, should I say? Why hasn't access to the cameras been removed yet?' The attack on Khalino came a day after Ukraine reportedly used ATACMS to strike an S-400 air defense system. The attack took place on the system near the village of Bolshoe Zhirovo, Kursk Region on Nov. 23, the Ukrainian Dosye Shpiona Telegram channel claimed. That's about 20 miles northwest of the airfield. The system was non-operational and being repaired, however, 'a 92N6E radar station and two launchers were destroyed,' Dosye Shpiona posited. In addition, five officers were killed in the attack. The War Zone cannot independently verify those claims. First confirmed successful ATACMS strike on Russian soil. S-400 air defence system radar and two launchers were destroyed in the Kursk region of Russia on 23.11.2024: 'On November 23, 2024, a missile strike was carried out on the S-400 air defense system in the village of… pic.twitter.com/2aD1ZWNig5&mdash; Special Kherson Cat (@bayraktar_1love) November 25, 2024 Khalino was first targeted by Ukraine in a December 2022 drone attack. Back then, Khalino was a Russian Aerospace Forces facility that played an important role in the full-on war. The airfield was then home to the 14th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment with two squadrons of Su-30SM Flanker-H fighters. The regiment had a nominal strength of 24 of those jets. The regional governor of Kursk Oblast at the time, Roman Starovoy, claimed that the drone attack ignited what he described as an 'oil reservoir' — presumably a fuel storage depot — within the airbase’s perimeter. He added that fire crews were containing the blaze. Multiple videos posted to social media showed flames leaping up into the night sky early this morning; thick black smoke was also indicative of a fuel fire. It was struck again on Aug. 14 what was then considered 'the largest attack on airfields in the war,' the Kyiv Independent reported, citing a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU). Though the U.S. has said Russia has moved its aircraft out of ATACMS range and a prominent Russian milblogger claimed there were none at Khalino at the time, two factors raise questions about Russia’s ongoing use of the installation. From the satellite images we obtained, it is clear they are using the facility to at least store munitions, which would be a natural target for Ukraine. Its Kursk invasion has been slowed by Russia's use of glide bombs in particular. The construction of concrete shelters there seems to be an acknowledgment by Russia that it intends to operate its combat aircraft at scale from the airfield in the future.

AH-64 Apache To Be Tested With Wing-Mounted AESA Radar	The U.S. Army wants to test an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar on its AH-64 Apache attack helicopter, using a standard Apache weapons pylon. A radar of this kind would be a very valuable tool for spotting, tracking, and engaging targets, especially in bad weather and at extended ranges, including airborne threats, but it would also be able to perform more general intelligence-gathering and provide improved situational awareness, along with other functions. If successful, the radar could find its way onto other Army platforms, both rotary and fixed-wing, the service has said. A Request for Information (RFI) for the potential inflight demonstration of the radar on an AH-64 was published by the U.S. government recently. Specifically, the Project Manager for Apache Attack Helicopter is conducting market research into potential sources that could provide a suitable radar. Then, a demonstration would be conducted at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, using the latest AH-64E V6 version.

U.S. Army U.S. Army photo by Capt. Leara Shumate According to the RFI, a state-of-the-art AESA radar would have the potential to be tested across a wide variety of functions, with the desired capabilities including 'fire control, pilotage, pilot aid in degraded visual environments (DVE), pole/tower and cable detection, airborne hazards, terrain following (TF), terrain avoidance (TA), and shoreline mapping using augmented reality (AR) techniques.' It is not uncommon for an RFI like this to be open-ended to try to solicit a broad array of possible options for addressing a problem set and this one notes that the Army is also interested in potential radar solutions that can only provide some of the outlined capabilities. Also, while the Apache is at the center of the program, at least as far as the inflight demonstration is concerned, the Army says it’s also looking at the potential to fit the same radar in the UH-60 Black Hawk and CH-47 Chinook helicopters, as well as the forthcoming Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA), which you can read more about here. The RFI also mentions the possibility of putting the radar on undisclosed fixed-wing Army aircraft. A rendering of the U.S. Army’s Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) tiltrotor. Bell Potentially, more than one vendor might end up being selected for an inflight demonstration of their system. Furthermore, the RFI states, the Army is also looking for responses from companies 'not yet able to integrate [AESA radar] onto a surrogate aircraft' and these are encouraged to 'highlight technical maturity limitations and other feasible demonstration capabilities.' The trials should take place over a three-week period, culminating with a demonstration day. As for the planned scope of the AH-64E V6 demonstration, this will see the AESA radar used to collect data against 'relevant targets' at 'various ranges.' Targets will be stationary and moving and will be on land (motorcycle, truck, and tank), in a littoral environment, and airborne (AH-64, MD530, T-6 Texan II, and undisclosed drones). The proposed scenario for the inflight demonstration includes attack profiles for ground, air, and littoral targeting, a nap-of-the-earth (NOE) route for terrain mapping (TM), TF, and TA, a DVE landing profile to preview pilot-aided symbology, and an overwater route for shoreline/synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mapping. Most fundamentally, an AESA radar differs from a more traditional radar in that it uses a matrix formed of hundreds of very small radar modules that are used to ‘steer’ an electronic beam, instead of the radar antenna physically moving to point at a target. This makes AESAs far more reliable than mechanically scanned types and they can benefit from better range, fidelity, and resistance to electronic warfare, and can do multiple tasks, from sensing to electronic attack to communications. The beam in an AESA radar can be moved around and modulated much more quickly, which also allows the radar to conduct multiple tasks simultaneously. In the Army demonstration, for example, this might involve surveilling a battlefield for targets on the ground and in the air, as well as monitoring weather along the AH-64’s flight path. The inclusion of drone targets in the test campaign is interesting, as this is a growing area of interest for the Army and the AH-64 community in particular. As we have discussed before, Army AH-64s are now practicing to refine their ability to detect and destroy enemy aerial drones, including while forward deployed to the Middle East. At the same time, AESA radars offer notable advantages over legacy radars when it comes to detecting one-way attack munitions and other smaller ‘kamikaze drones.’ Above all, AESA radars are typically able to spot objects of interest, even small ones and those with low radar cross-sections, faster and farther away.

Dean John Kd De Dios The U.S. Army’s decision to test an AESA radar on the AH-64 is also interesting in light of plans to modernize this design, something that Boeing discussed at length with TWZ only recently. While an AESA radar was not specifically mentioned, there is an ambition to move the AH-64’s current Longbow fire-control radar from its mast-mounted position and integrate it into the fuselage, to bring aerodynamic improvements. As we observed at the time, one way of installing a radar internally could be to use a conformal AESA array, a technology that is getting ever smaller and more versatile. A Boeing product card showing the major improvement strands foreseen for future modernized versions of the AH-64. Boeing Now, however, the Army is looking at what potentially be a simpler solution — mounting an AESA radar externally, under one of the AH-64’s stub wings. On the other hand, such an installation would take away valuable space and weight that would otherwise be used for weapons, external fuel, or other stores. The latest versions of the AH-64 also have major advantages when it comes to installing a radar of this kind, thanks to their open architecture that makes 'bolting on' systems like this a far easier and quicker process. Another big advantage lies in the AH-64's datalink system, which means a single AESA-equipped Apache could provide targeting to a formation of the same type or other platforms. While AESA radars are rarely found on helicopters — other than a handful of specific airborne early warning types — it’s notable that Russia has also been working to include this kind of technology on its Ka-52 Hokum attack helicopter. The naval Ka-52K version has been fitted with a Rezets AESA radar, while the land-based Ka-52M is expected to receive a new AESA radar, likely the V006 Rezets from the Zaslon company. This is an X-band radar that, according to the manufacturer, can detect a group of tanks from 25 miles and a fighter aircraft from up to 31 miles. The V006 or RZ-001 Rezets (cutter) radar with active electronic scanning antenna, possibly implemented in the Ka-52M in its new configuration. Piotr Butowski Other Russian AESA options for attack helicopters exist, too, notably the FH02 from Phazotron-NIIR, which actually combines two separate antennas: a mechanical slotted array for the Ka- and an AESA for the X-band. According to the company, a tank can be detected at a distance of 12.4 miles in the Ka range or 21.8 miles in the X range. A diagram showing the FH02 radar in the nose of a Ka-52. Phazotron In terms of existing Western-made AESA radars that are optimized for helicopters, the European company Leonardo offers the Osprey 30 that has already been installed on the U.S. Navy MQ-8C Fire Scout rotary-wing drone (where it is designated AN/ZPY-8) as well as the Norwegian version of the Leonardo AW101 helicopter. A Norwegian Leonardo AW101 helicopter, which is fitted with a Leonardo Osprey 30 AESA radar. Airwolfhound/Wikimedia Commons tim felce In particular, the Osprey 30 is compact enough that it can be fitted in an installation with no rotating antenna but still provides 360-degree coverage, using up to four separate fixed antennas. Its small size and the fact that the U.S. military already uses it could make the Osprey radar an attractive option for the U.S. Army AH-64 demonstration. Small-sized AESA radars are also something that the Army has been testing on some of its fixed-wing aircraft, including Northrop’s AN/ZPY-5 Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar (VADER), fitted in a pod on the Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (EMARSS), which is based on a Beechcraft King Air 350, and which you can read more about here. For now, we don’t know what options might be pitched for the AESA demonstration, but it’s certainly significant that four decades after the AH-64 first entered service, the Army is now looking seriously at introducing a new type of radar that promises to add major new capabilities in a variety of environments, for both targeting and navigation functions.

Army Gets Its First HADES Airborne Reconnaissance Jet	The U.S. Army has received the first of its new High Accuracy Detection and Exploitation System (HADES) aircraft, based on the Bombardier Global 6500 bizjet. Set to supersede a varied fleet of turboprop intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) platforms, HADES will fly higher, faster, and farther, and for longer periods, while carrying a bigger sensor payload. Before that happens, though, the first aircraft will need to be outfitted with its mission system and sensors — a process currently on hiatus after a protest over the contract award. Aujourd'hui, #BombardierDefense a livré la première plateforme #Global6500 à @USArmy pour le programme #HADES.Nous faisons progresser les capacités de #ISR aériennes de prochaine génération avec une portée, une vitesse et une fiabilité inégalées. @ISRTaskForce pic.twitter.com/SP3ePle5Ae&mdash; Bombardier (@Bombardier) November 25, 2024 The first HADES aircraft was formally handed over today at the Bombardier Defense facility in Wichita, Kansas, in a ceremony attended by the company’s vice president, Steve Patrick, as well as Army Lt. Gen. Anthony Hale, Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence, or G-2, and Andrew Evans, HQDA G-2’s ISR Task Force Director. Speaking at the handover today, Evans said: 'We are proud of the partnership with Bombardier Defense and the mission-focused professionals in the State of Kansas. We remain excited about the opportunities we can unlock by pairing the performance, versatility, and reliability of the Global 6500 with modern payloads aligned to priority intelligence requirements. HADES is the centerpiece of the Army's collection strategy, and the Global 6500 is the system that brings that strategy to life. This aircraft gives us the range, payload capacity, speed, and endurance to deliver timely, relevant, and responsive capabilities for the full spectrum of Army and Joint collection requirements.' A group shot in front of the first HADES prototype aircraft at the Bombardier Defense facility in Wichita, Kansas, today. Bombardier Integration work on the HADES aircraft is being undertaken by Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC), under an initial $93.5-million contract, although this could eventually rise to $991.3 million over 12 years. It’s also not clear how many HADES aircraft will be completed, although the Army has mentioned plans to buy a fleet of at least 14 jets, and potentially as many as 16. 'HADES is the centerpiece of the Army’s long-promised aerial ISR transformation strategy,' Lt. Gen. Hale said in August of this year when SNC was named as the lead system integrator. 'HADES allows the Army to fly higher, faster, and farther, which directly impacts our ability to see and sense deeper, delivering an organic capability in line with the Secretary of the Army’s number-one operational imperative — deep sensing.' As Lt. Gen. Hale referenced, the Global 6500’s range and speed performance will allow it to transit faster to farther-flung operating areas and, once there, to remain on station longer, or switch to other taskings. As we have discussed before, this could be especially relevant for future contingencies in the Pacific theater. A rendering of a fully equipped HADES based on the Global 6500 airframe. Bombardier Thanks to its high-altitude performance, the sensors on board the HADES are also able to ‘see’ further thanks to increased lines of sight. All in all, putting these sensors and capabilities on a modern bizjet platform should help to make it less vulnerable and effective, at least when compared with a legacy turboprop type. Vulnerability is a major concern when looking at the kinds of air defense threats the Army is likely to face in a future high-end fight against a near-peer competitor like China or Russia. 'HADES will allow our formations to see and sense farther and more persistently, providing an asymmetric advantage over our adversaries in large-scale operations and multidomain operations,' Army Brig. Gen. David Phillips, head of the service’s Program Executive Office for Aviation, said in a statement this summer. The full scope of the sensors on HADES remains unclear, but we do know that Raytheon’s Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar System-2B (ASARS-2B) will be central to its deep-sensing capabilities. The ASARS-2B can produce synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, in the form of highly detailed ground maps that can be obtained even through cloud cover, smoke, or dust, and both day and night. Furthermore, a ground-moving target indicator (GMTI) function allows the radar to spot and track the movement of vehicles. This is especially useful for real-time targeting and mapping out so-called ‘patterns of life’ in a particular area. A generic example of GMTI tracks overlaid on top of a SAR image. Public Domain Very likely, the full HADES sensor suite will include electro-optical and infrared cameras, plus signals intelligence (SIGINT) systems. Data sharing and communications capabilities will also be central to its mission. While the aircraft handed over to the Army today is the first that will be outfitted as a HADES platform, further Global 6500s and other bizjets are already being operated for ISR, as a mixture of contractor-owned and operated aircraft. Ultimately, some of these could end up being reconfigured as HADES aircraft. Among the Army’s 'bridging' aerial ISR assets is the Army Theater Level High-Altitude Expeditionary Next-Generation Airborne ISR-Sensor (Athena-S), under which SNC was contracted to convert another two Global 6500s, and another pair of Global 6500s converted by MAG Air and L3Harris under the Athena-Radar effort. A Bombardier Global 6500 in the process of being converted into an Army Theater Level High-Altitude Expeditionary Next-Generation Airborne ISR-Radar (ATHENA-R) aircraft. L3Harris Meanwhile, a Leidos-owned Bombardier Challenger 650 is already being operated by the Army as the Airborne Reconnaissance and Targeting Exploitation Multi-Mission Intelligence System (ARTEMIS), while the L3Harris Airborne Reconnaissance and Electronic Warfare System (ARES) makes use of a Global 6000 airframe. All these initiatives are expected to feed into the HADES program, helping define the final configuration of the aircraft and its sensors. Today, the Army operates more than 40 different crewed fixed-wing ISR aircraft, including RC-12Xs, MC-12Ss, and EO-5Cs. With that in mind, it’s unclear to what degree these can all be replaced by the HADES, even if the Army buys the full 16 as has been suggested as a possibility.

U.S. Army There are other questions, too, concerning the survivability of the HADES aircraft, especially in the kinds of high-end conflict that could be fought in the future against a near-peer adversary. After all, HADES, despite its performance advantage, is far from stealthy. Even with the improved capabilities of its sensors, it may very well have to get within range of longer-range air defense systems to gather intelligence. Deeply integrating it with a larger force will be key to its survivability, if it can survive at all in some circumstances. On the other hand, HADES is also just one element of a broader ISR architecture that the Army is now developing. This is a family of systems known as the Multi-Domain Sensing System (MDSS) and will likely include various uncrewed platforms, including high-altitude glider-like drones and balloons designed to operate in the stratosphere. Exactly when the Army will start to receive any of the planned MDSS capabilities is unclear and the timeline for the conversion of the HADES aircraft also remains unclear at this point. A graphic the Army previously released showing a notional 'operational view' (OV) for how its planned MDSS system of systems, including crewed ISR aircraft, might be employed in conjunction with other assets. U.S. Army Last month, it was reported that L3Harris had protested the Army’s decision to award SNC the contract to conduct integration work on the HADES. 'We carefully reviewed the information during the Army’s debrief process, which led us to challenge the HADES decision and request further analysis to ensure the proposal received an equitable evaluation,' an L3Harris spokesperson told Breaking Defense in a statement. 'Our goal remains to ensure that mission operators receive the lowest risk and most capable solution available for an increasingly complex security environment,' they added. A rendering of the rival L3Harris-Leidos-MAG Aerospace proposal for HADES which lost out to the SNC solution. L3Harris The formal protest means the U.S. Government Accountability Office is now reviewing the Army’s contract decision, something that is expected to delay work on the HADES program. SNC says the protest is over a 'minor administrative issue' and that it’s not technical in nature. Speaking today, Andrew Evans admitted that 'we’re in a hole,' but said it was not unexpected. 'When you’re dealing with a potentially multi-billion dollar program like HADES, you would expect that your proposal was was fully vetted, fully reviewed. And that’s what industry is doing at this point, they’ve asked the GAO to look at that just to make sure that all t’s were crossed and i’s were dotted. And we welcome that, because that’s what keeps us on the right side of these contracts.' The GAO is due to deliver its verdict before December 26. While there are likely more hurdles ahead of it, today’s delivery of the first HADES prototype is a significant milestone, as the Army looks forward to introducing its next-generation crewed fixed-wing ISR jet.

Mysterious Drones Are Back Near U.S. Air Bases In The United King...	On Friday, The War Zone broke the news about a multi-drone incursion of the U.S. Air Force's master fighter base in the United Kingdon, RAF Lakenheath. Since then we have received information that the incursions were more widespread, occurring around multiple bases. Now we have confirmed that the drones are back near RAF Lakenheath as well as RAF Mildenhall, which is a very concerning development to say the least. A U.S. defense official confirmed to us this morning that the drone flights have resumed near both installations. While RAF Lakenheath houses primarily squadrons of F-15E Strike Eagle and F-35A Joint Strike Fighters, RAF Mildenhall hosts strategic surveillance aircraft and aerial refueling tankers. There are claims that F-15E Strike Eagles were launched to investigate from the air during the RAF Lakenheath today. We received the same information during the first incursions last week, although we cannot confirm the fighter's involvement in the response, flight tracking information posted online does appear to support this. U.S. Airmen assigned to the 48th Operations Group pose for a photo at RAF Lakenheath, England, Aug. 26, 2024. The base is home to F-15E and F-35A squadrons. (U.S. Air Force Photo by Senior Airman Renee Nicole S.N. Finona) The original incident at Lakenheath was not an isolated one. Similar drone incursions happened around the same time at RAF Mildenhall and RAF Feltwell between November 20th and 22nd, according to USAFE. U.K. Ministry of Defense provided TWZ.com a statement Monday morning as well, stating, in part: 'We employ multi-layered and credible force protection measures, we will not go into specifics and it would be inappropriate to comment further on operational security matters, however, we can confirm we are working closely with USVF [U.S. Visiting Force), Police and other partners to respond to recent events] Further details remain limited at this time, but clearly these events are going to result in a more expansive response by the U.S. Air Force and the United Kingdom. What that will look like remains unclear.' RAF Lakenheath (Google Earth) There is much about these events that we do not know. While 'the number of UASs fluctuated and they ranged in size/configuration' according to the USAF, exactly what their configurations were remains unclear as does their specific pattern of operations. We also don't know what drone awareness capabilities are deployed to these bases and when they were installed if so. Regardless, this is turning out to be major string of events that is going to require a very robust response in terms of technical capabilities and resources to investigate and potentially mitigate. We should see that response taking shape in the hours and days to come. TWZ has led coverage over many years on the major threat drones pose to military installations, infrastructure, VIPs and more. These latest incidents in the U.K. come eleven months after a similar rash of drone incursions occurred over Langley AFB in Virginia, a story TWZ exclusively broke in March. The USAF's highly sensitive Plant 42 in Palmdale has also become a major drone incursion hotspot since then. Just last week another major scare occurred a major Army testing area. There has also been real fears that Russia may attempt to strike NATO airfields with drones, which has led to major alert posture changes at some facilities. Regardless, the Langley drone incursions were a turning point of sorts, with this issue now being taken far more seriously after being largely brushed aside for years even though the threat had displayed itself multiple times over some of the most sensitive U.S. facilities and assets. This is a rapidly developing story, we will update you as soon as we get more information.

Ukraine Lost Nearly Half The Territory It Captured In Russia: Rep...	Faced with waves of counterattacks from nearly 60,000 Russian troops, Ukraine has lost more than 40% of the territory it once controlled in its August invasion of Kursk, Reuters reported, citing a member of the Ukrainian General Staff. 'At most, we controlled about 1,376 square kilometers (531 square miles), now of course this territory is smaller. The enemy is increasing its counterattacks,' the source told Reuters. 'Now we control approximately 800 square kilometers (309 square miles). We will hold this territory for as long as is militarily appropriate.' Ukraine has lost more than 40% of the territory it seized in Russia's Kursk region in August, a senior Ukrainian military source said. (Not much of a bargaining chip for Kyiv.) Kevin Rothrock (@KevinRothrock) November 23, 2024 Adding to Ukraine’s problems in Kursk is the presence of some 12,000 North Korean troops, Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Directorate, told us. In exchange for its support, North Korea is reportedly getting air defense systems and other military equipment from Russia, according to South Korea’s National Security Adviser Shin Wonsik. Energy shipments are also occurring. You can read more about that here. Still, Ukraine continues to do what it can to hold Russian forces at bay.

However, that does not appear to have worked, with the Russians advancing across wide areas of the front lines in Ukraine. Towns like Kurakhove in the Donetsk region and Kupiansk in the Kharkiv region are especially in danger. 'The General Staff source said the Kurakhove region was the most threatening for Kyiv now as Russian forces were advancing there at 200-300 meters (yards) a day and had managed to break through in some areas,' according to Reuters. In some places, Ukrainian troops are outnumbered six to one and are exhausted, allowing Russia to make its largest gains since the first weeks of the all-out war, The New York Times reported.

Ukraine, meanwhile, is struggling with recruiting and President Volodymyr Zelensky has continued to avoid lowering the draft age to get more troops. Russian President Vladimir Putin 'wants to show that he will fulfill, as he said, the tasks of the so-called 'special military operation', occupy the entire Donbas, and he needs to push us out of the Kursk direction,' Zelensky said on Saturday. 'He has these two tasks. This is the reason for our results: difficulties in the east. Yes, there is an insufficient number of Ukrainian Armed Forces there. Yes, Ukrainian units are understaffed there for various reasons, including the slow delivery of aid.' You can see Ukrainians in Kursk coming under attack in the following video.

As we discussed at length, Trump has promised to quickly end the war, with some in his inner circle suggesting a freeze in the front lines as they are. That’s adding pressure on Ukraine to keep as much territory as possible both at home and in Russia, the latter for a bargaining chip. To do so becomes more difficult every day. However, no concrete plan for Ukraine has yet emerged from Trump. Meanwhile, there are many in Ukraine who see positives in his election, because they’ve been frustrated by what they’ve seen as a slow rollout of needed equipment like tanks and F-16 fighters. There is a confluence of events between the Kursk invasion and Trump's inauguration, Zelensky posited. 'The most important thing for Putin is to push us out of the Kursk region,' Zelensky said. 'And all these stories, all these demonstrative strikes with new missiles are not just for show. He has set this task. I am sure that he wants to push us out by January 20 next year,' Zelensky said. #Zelensky said that #Putin wants to oust the Defense Forces of #Ukraine from the #Kursk region of #Russia before Trump’s inauguration.'I am sure that he wants to oust us by January 20 of next [2025] year.

The news out of Velkya Novosilika is particularly bad for Ukraine, according to Ukrainian open-source investigator Andrew Perpetua . The news coming from the Velyka Novosilka area is very bad.

'Today, more details have been revealed about the new missile that Russia used to strike Dnipro,' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on social media Friday. 'These details will be shared with international journalists and media because the world must know the truth. It must understand that the only party that does not want peace is Russia. That is why Russia is constantly escalating.' Today, more details have been revealed about the new missile that Russia used to strike Dnipro.

The missile reached a terminal velocity of Mach 11, or more than 8,400 miles per hour, and traveled 15 minutes from its launch site about 500 miles to the east, GUR claimed on social media. That lines up with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s claim yesterday that the weapon he called 'Oreshnik,' was a non-nuclear missile with 'hypersonic technology.' Hypersonic speeds are defined as anything above Mach 5. However, GUR indicated the missile was moving even faster than Putin’s claim that Oreshnik topped out at Mach 10, or about 7,610 mph at sea level, but that number decreases with extreme altitudes a ballistic missile flies at during different phases of its flight. The missile contained six warheads with six submunitions each, GUR explained. The submunition part is likely lost in translations and could mean the explosive warhead in each reentry vehicle as opposed to six subventions on each one. Videos emerging on social media showed what appeared to be six warheads hurtling toward the ground and multiple impacts as a result. You can see one of those videos below.

The Oreshnik is based on the previous RS-26 Rubezh ballistic missile, the Pentagon said on Thursday. You can read much more about in our deep dive here. Days before the attack, Telegram channels began posting information about a looming attack by the RS-26. 'Information appeared on the territory of the TG that, POSSIBLY, the Russians are preparing to launch the RS-26 from Kapustin (Astrakhan) in an experimental version,' the Ukrainian Donbas Operational Telegram channel stated on Wednesday, a day the attack occurred. Donbas Operational even included a map in its post that showed the launch site location. A day before the new Russian ballistic missile test, the Donbas Operational Telegram channel predicted it could happen and posted a map that is close to the actual launch direction. (Donbas Operational) Shortly after that post, the Paratroopers Diary Telegram channel was one of many Russian channels to suggest that GUR put out information about the pending attack. 'Ukrainian intelligence has received information that today Russia plans to strike Ukraine with an experimental RS-26 Rubezh (Avangard) non-nuclear missile,' Paratroopers Diary claimed. The post included an image purporting to be the weapon on its launcher. A day before Russia fired a new ballistic missile at Ukraine, the Russian Paratroopers Diary Telegram channel claimed Ukrainian intelligence had warned the attack was coming. (Paratroopers Diary) Ukrainian officials quickly pushed back on these claims. 'A terrorist country is conducting a massive information and psychological attack against Ukraine,' GUR stated on Telegram Wednesday. 'A message about the threat of a ‘particularly massive’ rocket-bomb attack on Ukrainian cities today is being spread through messengers and social networks, allegedly on behalf of the GUR. This message is a fake, it contains grammatical errors typical for Russian information and psychological operations.' GUR urged people to 'trust information only from official resources and from the spokespersons of the Ministry of Education and Culture. The enemy, unable to subjugate Ukrainians by force, resorts to measures of intimidation and psychological pressure on society. Please be vigilant and persistent.' #гурінформує Країна-терорист проводить масовану інформаційно-психологічну атаку проти України pic.twitter.com/QdgWUwL7Pp&mdash; Defence intelligence of Ukraine (@DI_Ukraine) November 20, 2024 As the rumors were swirling, the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv temporarily closed after officials 'received information about a potential significant air attack on November 20,' the embassy announced. Several NATO allies followed suit. A senior Ukrainian official said Russia was using the closures to stoke fear. 'In terms of information, now they are also trying to shake panicky moods against the background of the closing of embassies,' Andriy Kovalenko, head of Ukraine’s Center for Countering Disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council, said on Telegram Wednesday. Ukraine has been well aware that Russia was planning future attacks and stockpiling munitions to hit the nation’s power and heating infrastructure ahead of winter, Kovalenko noted. 'The Russians prepared for shelling in the cold season – this is their tactic,' he posited. 'Rockets were stockpiled, aviation and fleet were being prepared. Bet on cruise missiles and ballistics, as well as drones for the depletion of air defense. These plans are not unexpected, they are known and warned about.'

(Photo by Kyiv Regional Military Administration/Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images) Anadolu A North Korean general was wounded in a Ukrainian missile strike on southwestern Russia’s Kursk region, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, citing anonymous Western officials. A day earlier, Ukraine fired at least 10 U.K.-supplied Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missiles at the Maryino estate, a site located around 32 kilometers (20 miles) from the front lines in the Kursk region, Western and Ukrainian officials said. It was the first use of those missiles inside Russia. The Journal's sources did not reveal the North Korean general's identity. However, Ukrainian and South Korean officials previously told the newspaper that Pyongyang sent Colonel General Kim Yong Bok to oversee North Korea’s coordination with Russia. Several Russian officers were also killed and wounded in that attack, a Ukrainian Telegram channel claimed. 'As a result of the strike, 18 servicemen were killed and 33 more were injured to varying degrees of severity,' the Dosye Shpiona Telegram channel claimed. 'Among the wounded were three DPRK servicemen ( two men with serious injuries and one female medic with minor injuries). The wounded were taken to the Rylsk Central Regional Hospital. Most of the victims were officers from the Southern and Eastern Military Districts.' Another 13 Russian sappers were injured in the aftermath of the attack as they worked on unexploded ordnance. Contrary to many reports appearing online, there was no confirmation by Dosye Spiona that a Russian general was killed in the attack. 'It is also reported that at the time of the strike, the first deputy commander of the Leningrad Military District, Lieutenant General Solodchuk, was at the command post,' Dosye Shiona added. 'There is no information yet about his condition.' The War Zone cannot independently verify any of these claims. The incident was reportedly captured by a Ukrainian drone unit, which you can see in the following video. A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry reiterated his nation’s position that there are no preclusions to the use of SCALP cruise missiles against targets in Russia. 'France’s view is clear. As President [Emmanuel] Macron said, there’s no red line on this. Ukraine has the right to defend itself against the aggression it has suffered from the Russians since [24] February 2022, and it’s in a situation of self-defense,' said M. Christophe Lemoine. 'It’s a principle in keeping with public international law, it’s in the UN Charter. So it absolutely has the right to defend itself and must be able to do so.' France fully supports Ukraine’s right to use SCALPs to strike Russia, he added. 'France has provided Ukraine with substantial military support since the start of the aggression. It has supplied various assets, including missiles,' the spokesman explained. 'And once again, there’s no red line. It’s quite a clear point that President Macron reiterated recently.' The French Foreign Minister said there are no red lines in supporting Ukraine, including firing French missiles at Russia 'in self-defense.' pic.twitter.com/Sg1xumTYNs&mdash; MilitaryNewsUA (@front_ukrainian) November 23, 2024 Zelensky said he plans to increase Ukraine’s production of long-range drones and missiles in its latest attempt to gain an edge over Russia. Kyiv plans to produce some 30,000 long-range drones. next year, along with 3,000 cruise missiles and 'drone-missile hybrids,' reported the Kyiv Independent. The announcement was made in a speech to Ukraine’s parliament on Tuesday just two days after President Joe Biden approved Kyiv's use of U.S.-donated Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) short-range ballistic missiles to hit targets inside Russia. It came as Kyiv carried out its first strike with ATACMS on a military arsenal near the Russian town of Karachev in the Bryansk region, more than 70 miles from Ukraine’s border.

Bunker Talk: Let’s Talk About All The Things We Did And Didn’t Co...	Welcome to Bunker Talk. This is a weekend open discussion post for the best commenting crew on the net, in which we can chat about all the stuff that went on this week that we didn’t cover. We can also talk about the stuff we did or whatever else grabs your interest. In other words, it’s an off-topic thread. The caption to this week’s top shot reads: The U.S. Air Force staffs missile silos with officers ready to launch nuclear weapons in case of an attack on the United States.

If you have political differences, hash it out respectfully, stick to the facts, and no childish name-calling or personal attacks of any kind. If you can’t handle yourself in that manner, then please, discuss virtually anything else. No drive-by garbage political memes. No conspiracy theory rants. Links to crackpot sites will be axed, too. Trolling and shitposting will not be tolerated. No obsessive behavior about other users. Just don’t interact with folks you don’t like. Do not be a sucker and feed trolls! That’s as much on you as on them. Use the mute button if you don’t like what you see. So unless you have something of quality to say, know how to treat people with respect, understand that everyone isn’t going to subscribe to your exact same worldview, and have come to terms with the reality that there is no perfect solution when it comes to moderation of a community like this, it’s probably best to just move on.

Skunk Works Tests Sees AI-Enabled L-29 Jets Fly Mock Air-To-Air M...	A human controller flying in an L-39 Albatros jet ordered a pair of L-29 Delfin jets with artificial intelligence (AI) driven flight technology acting as surrogates for advanced drones to engage simulated enemy fighters in a series of recent flight tests. Lockheed Martin's famed Skunk Works advanced projects division led the experiment, which reflects growing discussions about how exactly crewed platforms will manage their uncrewed companions in the future. This is becoming a particularly important question for the U.S. Air Force in regard to its Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) program. Skunk Works collaborated with Lockheed Martin's own Demonstrations and Prototypes organization and the University of Iowa's Operator Performance Laboratory (OPL) on the crewed-uncrewed teaming test, according to a company press release. The testing occurred, at least in part, over an unspecified range in Iowa. 'In a series of flight tests, the Skunk Works and OPL teams simulated an offensive counter air mission where an airborne, human 'battle manager' aboard an L-39 Albatros assigned targets to two AI-controlled L-29 Delfin jets, which then worked together to defeat two mock enemy jets using simulated mission systems and weapons,' the release explains. '[The] airborne battle manager issued real-time commands to AI-controlled aircraft through a touchscreen pilot vehicle interface (PVI).' A stock picture of one of the L-29 jets from the University of Iowa's Operator Performance Laboratory (OPL) involved in the recent Skunk Works test. USAF 'These flight tests build on previous experiments that demonstrated AI-controlled air-to-ground jamming and geolocation,' the release adds. 'This year, the tests shifted to AI in air-to-air combat, where AI sends commands directly to the planes' autopilots. This is the third test of this type and the first to include a real-time human battle manager overseeing the AI's actions.' As The War Zone has highlighted in the past, there are significant benefits to using piloted or pilot-optional platforms as surrogates for drones in tests within the United States. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) currently imposes significant restrictions on truly uncrewed flight operations inside U.S. airspace. This, in turn, means that pilot-optional aircraft present significant benefits, especially research and development and test and evaluation activities. Having a human pilot onboard can help accelerate certain kinds of testing and also provides an extra margin of safety. The U.S. military and other companies beyond Lockheed Martin, such as Shield AI, have used OPLs L-29s, as well as contractor-operated L-39s and other pilot-optional platforms, to support advanced autonomy and drone development efforts in the past for exactly these reasons. In addition, despite continual advances in what can be done in virtual environments through advanced modeling and simulation, being able to conduct live testing remains very important, in general. 'Live flight tests are a crucial aspect of advancing our expertise in AI and autonomy,' Matthew 'Gabe' Beard, Lockheed Martin Skunk Works autonomy/AI and machine learning engineering manager, said after another test involving OPL's L-29s that demonstrated their ability to conduct AI-enabled air-to-air intercepts back in June. 'These flights are powerful demonstrations of our ability to quickly and affordably develop and test operationally relevant AI capabilities.' OPL's L-29s at Edwards Air Force Base in California earlier this year. USAF Lockheed Martin is among an array of U.S. defense contractors working to develop more and more advanced AI agents and expand the envelope of what AI-driven autonomous flight systems can do. This includes General Atomics and Anduril, which also currently developing drones as part of the first phase of the CCA program, also known as Increment 1. Lockheed Martin was among the companies not selected to proceed in Increment 1, but that are looking toward the next phase, or Increment 2. Increasing trust in those systems to do what they are instructed to do by human operators is also a key aspect of this autonomy work. Additional developments are undoubtedly ongoing in the classified realm, as well. This is hardly the first time Lockheed Martin has demonstrated an operational relevant autonomous flight capability, either. Back in 2015, the company, working together with the CalSpan Corporation, demonstrated the ability of a highly modified pilot-optional F-16 testbed, now designated the X-62A, to fly in formation with a standard two-seat F-16D, break off to fly a preplanned route, and the form back up with the other jet, all while in a semi-autonomous mode. The F-16 testbed took part in a very similar experiment in 2017 that also included the jet carrying out a simulated strike mission. Since then, the X-62A has been involved in even more advanced autonomy testing work, including a first-of-its-kind AI-driven dogfight with another F-16 just earlier this year. You can read more about that particular jet here. The X-62A test jet. USAF The X-62A Variable In-flight Simulator Aircraft (VISTA) flies over Edwards Air Force Base, California. U.S. Air Force photo All of this is being done with a particular eye on meeting emerging U.S. military requirements, especially the autonomy demands that the U.S. Air Force's CCA program is generating. The Air Force is also working on autonomous capabilities and other technologies to support future drone developments in direct cooperation with the U.S. Navy and branches of the U.S. military through the CCA effort. 'The work we're doing with the University of Iowa's OPL is foundational for the future of air combat, where a family of crewed and uncrewed systems will work together to execute complex missions,' John Clark, head of Skunk Works, said in a statement after the recent test. 'We're excited to leverage our diverse skillsets to advance all elements of this new way of operating.' For the CCA program, there continue to be questions not just about what kinds of missions the highly autonomous drones will expected to perform, but also about how they will be controlled, especially by operators in other aircraft. The touchscreen devices like the one featured in the recent Skunk Works test continue to be a user interface of choice. 'There’s a lot of opinions amongst the Air Force about the right way to go [about controlling drones from other aircraft],' Skunk Works head John Clark told The War Zone and others at this year’s Air & Space Forces Association’s (AFA) Air, Space & Cyber Conference back in September. 'The universal thought, though, is that this [a tablet or other touch-based interface] may be the fastest way to begin experimentation. It may not be the end state.' The video below from Collins Aerospace presents one notional vision for how advanced drones might operate together with crewed aircraft, including receiving instructions from human operators via touchscreen devices, at least initially. At the same time, there is growing evidence that tablet-like devices, especially, may create additional burdens for pilots. 'We started with [the Air Force’s] Air Combat Command with tablets… There was this idea that they wanted to have this discreet control,' Michael Atwood, Vice President of Advanced Programs for General Atomics, said during an appearance on The Merge podcast earlier this year. 'I got to fly in one of these jets with a tablet. And it was really hard to fly the airplane, let alone the weapon system of my primary airplane, and spatially and temporally think about this other thing.' 'We’re working through a spectrum of options that are the minimum invasive opportunities, as well as something that’s more organically equipped, where there’s not even a tablet,' Skunk Work's Clark added at the AFA gathering. An example of an actual tablet-based drone control system General Atomics has experimented with in the past. GA-ASI The Air Force's CCA program is increasingly facing a raft of other questions, including about how and where they will operate from, especially on a day-to-day basis domestically within the United States, what it will take to deploy them to forward locations for non-combat and combat missions, and other new training, maintenance, and logistics demands. Serious concerns are also building about the service's ability to pay for its planned CCA fleets and other modernization plans. You can read more about all of these issues here. The Navy and other branches of the U.S. military will have to answer the same kinds of questions when it comes to their future drone plans and how those pilotless platforms will be managed. The latest Skunk Works test involving the 'battle manager' riding in the L-39 jet directing the two L-29 aircraft is another step forward in finding the necessary answers to help turn various uncrewed aviation ambitions into realities.

Marines’ New Sniper Rifle Declared Fully Operational A Year Early	The U.S. Marine Corps has hit full operational capability for the service’s MK22 Mod 0 Advanced Sniper Rifle (ASR), the service announced this week, a feat that took place a full year ahead of schedule due to the rifle already being fielded by U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) and the Army. With every Marine reconnaissance and infantry unit, as well as military occupational specialty schools now sporting the bolt-action MK22, the service said it is providing snipers a more versatile and sustainable weapon as Marines prepare for a potential conflict with China. The MK22 replaces the M40A6 (a derivative of the long-serving Remington 700 platform) and MK13 Mod 7 rifles, and its barrels are chambered for 7.62X51 mm, .300 Norma Magnum and .338 Norma Magnum rounds, which the service said will help Marines hit targets from farther away when needed, and with greater precision. U.S. Marine Corps M40A6 sniper rifle. (U.S. Marine Corps) Lance Cpl. Dalton Payne The MK22 also sports a caliber agnostic 7-35 variable power Precision Day Optic (PDO). 'The M317 Precision Day Optic (PDO) paired with the MK22 is a game changer,' Brian Nelson, the MK22 project officer for Marine Corps Systems Command, said in a statement announcing the rifle's arrival in the force. While the MK22 is heavier than its predecessors, having one gun that can swap out calibers will benefit the force as it prepares for a West Pacific war with China as part of the Force Design 2030 revamp of the service, the Marines said in 2022, when snipers began testing the new rifle. MK22's arrival means Marines will only have to have different ammunition and extra barrels on hand in order to cover two caliber types currently fired by the M40A6 and MK13 Mod 7. This saves on logistics, with just one platform having to be supported by armorers instead of two. The MK22 also features a 10-round detachable magazine and is viewed as a more sustainable weapon by the Marines, with less maintenance time and repairs that can be done at a lower level, eliminating the need to send the firearm to an intermediate repair location. A so-called 'condemned barrel' will no longer take the weapon out of the fight, the Marines said. A U.S. Marine takes aim with the service's new MK22 sniper rifle. (U.S. Marine Corps) Sgt. Cristian Bestul Every MK22 kit includes the M317 PDO, its scope mount, a suppressor, tool and cleaning kit and three barrels, with recon and infantry units also getting the .300 Winchester Magnum barrel, scout sniper tripod kit, anti-reflection device and laster filter unit, according to the Corps. 'Marines like the ability to conduct caliber conversions at their level and the fact that they only have one rifle instead of the two it replaced,' Kevin Marion, a logistics management specialist with Marine Corps Systems Command, said. 'This shift improves operational efficiency, reduces the logistical burden on units, and lightens the individual Marine's load.' The Marines’ new rifle is based on the Barrett Multi-Role Adaptive Design, or MRAD, sniper rifle, which was brought into the fold by U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) in 2021. You can read more about SOCOM’s adoption of that rifle here. The Army began equipping its Green Berets with the ASR in 2021, and they have been fielded by the conventional force as well. Barrett first unveiled the rifle in 2010 and offers barrel lengths ranging from 20 to 27 inches. The Marine Corps' announcement this week did not make clear which barrel lengths the service adopted. It's been a relatively short career for the MK13 sniper rifle, which was adopted by the Marines starting in 2018. The workhorse M40 had been in service since 1966.

Multiple Drone Incident Just Occurred Over USAF Fighter Base In E...	A number of drones were spotted over and near RAF Lakenheath in England on Nov. 20, the Air Force told The War Zone in response to our query about the incident. 'The number of UASs fluctuated and they ranged in size/configuration,' a spokesperson for U.S. Air Forces in Europe - Air Forces in Africa (USAFE) told us 'The UASs were actively monitored and installation leaders determined that none of the incursions impacted base residents or critical infrastructure.' RAF Lakenheath. (Google Earth) There were unconfirmed reports that F-15E Strike Eagles were sent aloft to chase the drones and that flight operations at the base were affected. The Air Force did not immediately respond to those claims. 'To protect operational security, we do not discuss our specific force protection measures but retain the right to protect the installation,' USAFE told us. 'We continue to monitor our airspace and are working with host-nation authorities and mission partners to ensure the safety of base personnel, facilities, and assets.' RAF Lakenheath houses an extremely important set of capabilities, most notably the U.S. Air Forces in Europe's only fourth and fifth-generation fighter wing and home to F-35A & F-15E tactical jets.

The jet in front has a number of red missile silhouettes painted above its name, 'Hellcat,' that look to reflect air-to-air kills during its recently concluded deployment to the Middle East. USAF This is the latest known drone incursion over a U.S. military installation or sensitive area, a topic that The War Zone has covered extensively. Two days before the Lakenheath drones were spotted, drones were seen over the U.S. Army’s Picatinny Arsenal in northern New Jersey. The FBI has taken over the investigation into that incident, which you can read more about in our initial report here. There has been an increase in intrusion events at home and abroad, and especially after the events over Langley AFB last winter, they are being looked at with much more concern. This now includes accelerating the deployment of military capabilities to identify and defeat drone systems near these key areas. However, it's worth noting that when it comes to defending homeland installations from drones, none of these countermeasures include directed energy weapons or kinetic systems, such as guns and missiles.

North Korea Getting New Air Defenses In Return For Supporting Rus...	North Korea has received Russian air defense systems in return for its support of the Kremlin’s war in Ukraine, South Korean officials have declared. The transfer of these weapons is the latest development in the deepening military relationship between Pyongyang and Moscow, which has also seen more than 10,000 North Korean troops sent to Russia in recent weeks to fight against Ukraine. According to Shin Wonsik, the top security adviser for South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, Russia has provided surface-to-air missiles and other unspecified air defense equipment. This will be used to reinforce the air defense of the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, Shin told a South Korean SBS TV program today. Shin Wonsik, the security adviser for South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, while he was still serving as South Korean Defense Minister, in July 2024. Photo by Yoshikazu Tsuno/Gamma-Rapho/Pool/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu While the specific type of air defense systems wasn't disclosed, Lee Illwoo, an expert with the Korea Defense Network in South Korea said that the S-400 surface-to-air missile system was most likely. This systems, which combine long-range surface-to-air missiles, launchers, ground-based radar systems, and other components, are among the most advanced available anywhere. As well as being widely used by Russia, including in the war with Ukraine, they have been exported to Algeria, Belarus, China, India, and Turkey. The S-400 has a maximum range of up to 250 miles and can tackle lower-end ballistic missile targets, as well as aircraft and cruise missiles. You can read more about the system and its capabilities here. A diagram showing various typical components used within an S-400 battalion. RIA NOVOSTI Overall, the S-400 would make sense for North Korea, especially in a strategic role for the protection of Pyongyang since the country otherwise lacks modern air defense systems in this class. The protection of the capital primarily relies upon mainly outdated surface-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft artillery. Meanwhile, North Korea is increasingly active in building its own types of air defense systems. While North Korea claimed to have operationally fielded the domestically produced KN-06, also known as the Pongae-5, long-range surface-to-air missile system as long ago as 2017, the current status of this is unclear. Even if it has been more widely deployed, it is likely less capable than the S-400. The KN-06 is understood to be based on the Chinese HQ-9 system, which itself is derived from the Russian S-300 — an air defense system that is a generation behind the S-400. North Korean leader Kim Kong Un watches a test launch of the KN-06 surface-to-air missile. North Korea State News Potentially, other air defense equipment may have been provided by Russia, too. According to Kim Dae Young, a military expert at the Korea Research Institute for National Strategy, counter-drone equipment may also be of particular interest to North Korea, which faces a growing threat from South Korean and U.S. uncrewed aerial vehicles. At the same time, long-range S-300s or even Pantsir series short-range air defense systems would be useful for North Korea. The threat posed by drones to Pyongyang in particular was recently highlighted when North Korea accused South Korea of using drones to scatter propaganda leaflets over its capital. Videos released by the North Korean authorities showed two different types of UAVs. That incident, which you can read about here, came after waves of excrement and trash-filled balloons launched by North Korea into the South, a campaign of disruption that started this summer, accompanying a period of worsening tensions on the peninsula overall. Photos released by the North Korean state news agency KCNA last month appear to show drones, which it says were used to drop propaganda leaflets over Pyongyang. KCNA South Korea refused to confirm whether or not it was behind the alleged drone flights. As TWZ highlighted at the time, 'The ability of drones — sophisticated or otherwise — to penetrate the heavily defended airspace over the North Korean capital will surely be a considerable worry to officials there and would appear to highlight deficiencies in the North’s best air defense coverage.' Very likely, any military campaign launched by South Korea against the North would see extensive use of drones, including to confuse and overwhelm air defenses. This is especially relevant in the case of Pyongyang, which would be on the receiving end of decapitation strikes against the leadership.

Photo by South Korean Defense Ministry via Getty Images Whatever the types of air defense systems that have apparently now been supplied, they will be a significant boost to the North Korean military — officially, the Korean People’s Army. At the same time, it’s clear that Russia is in dire need of air defense systems, with the war in Ukraine putting significant stress on its existing surface-to-air missile stocks. Currently, there is a huge demand for such systems to protect the homeland as well as to defend airspace over the front lines. Presumably, it’s been determined that giving up some S-400s — or whatever other systems — is worth it for what they are getting in exchange from North Korea. The arrival of new military hardware from Russia was long expected, by way of thanks for North Korea’s increasing support for the Kremlin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine as well as the counteroffensive in Russia’s Kursk region. New: North Korean troops have been spotted in Ukraine’s eastern Kharkiv region, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s military in the region told CNN. 'I can confirm to you that, according to radio intercepts, North Korean units have been spotted in the Kharkiv region,' said Yevhen…&mdash; Jim Sciutto (@jimsciutto) November 22, 2024 Pyongyang’s support for the war has seen the supply of a diverse range of weapons, including millions of badly needed artillery rounds and various kinds of other ammunition. A recent assessment from the South Korean National Intelligence Service (NIS), based on intelligence provided by the Ukrainian Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR), listed North Korean weapons collected from the battlefield, including claimed '122mm and 152mm shells, Bulsae-4 anti-tank missiles, short-range ballistic missiles such as the KN-23, and RPG anti-tank rockets.' 'Considering the size of containers loaded on cargo ships traveling between North Korea and Russia, it appears that a total of more than eight million 122mm and 152mm shells have been provided to Russia so far,' NIS concluded. While all this equipment is in great demand from the Russian side, the deployment of North Korean troops in support of the offensive in Ukraine is an even more significant symbol of the growing military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow. Last month, Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, the head of the Ukrainian Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR) told TWZ that there were nearly 12,000 North Korean infantry troops training in eastern Russia to fight Ukraine. Since then, there have been accounts of North Korean soldiers taking part in combat, including unconfirmed videos purporting to show fatalities. Earlier this week, The Wall Street Journal reported that a senior North Korean general had been wounded by a Ukrainian strike in the Kursk region. North Koreans in Kursk region sleeping#Ukraine #Russia #NorthKorea pic.twitter.com/PAI0JMrkKJ&mdash; The Global 202 (@theglobal202) November 22, 2024 Ever since North Korea stepped in to assist Russia, there has been a good deal of speculation as to what it might get in return. As well as financial reward, including economic cooperation and energy shipments, it was long suspected that North Korea would likely benefit from Russian advanced weapons and technological expertise. There are reports out of South Korea that Russia may have already been helping North Korea develop a space-based surveillance system, as part of a quid-pro-quo arrangement. Surveillance satellites are one area in which North Korea has had some notable failures, while Russia has much more relevant experience. There have been suggestions that Pyongyang might receive new Russian combat aircraft to overhaul its badly aging air force. The delivery of air defense systems could even be an indicator that fighters might be next for North Korea. Even if such a transfer were to involve older, surplus MiG-29 Fulcrums, these would likely be welcomed by Pyongyang. North Korean Pukguksong-5 SLBMs on parade in early 2021. Korean Central News Agency www.twz.com There have also been concerns that Moscow might provide North Korea with technologies to help accelerate its nuclear and long-range ballistic missile programs. Russia would also be a prime candidate to assist North Korea in pushing forward its submarine program, which also includes a growing family of submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) as well as increasingly advanced submarine technologies. While these remain possibilities, it appears that the first tangible benefits headed to the Korean People’s Army will be high-end air defense systems. With North Korean troops only starting to appear on the battlefield in support of Russia, it’s highly likely that Pyongyang’s assistance will continue, and even be stepped up, which will likely lead to more Russian arms heading to North Korea.

Conventionally Armed ICBM Concept Highlighted By Unprecedented Ru...	It is now confirmed that the weapon Russia fired in an unprecedented attack on Ukraine yesterday was not an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). However, the missile in question, named Oreshnik, is technically derived from an ICBM. Its use highlights past discussions about the potential value of a conventionally armed ICBM, which some countries may be looking at fielding if they haven't already, and that would offer a unique extremely long-range strike capability below the nuclear threshold. Russian President Vladimir Putin disclosed the existence of Oreshnik and announced its use in the attack on the eastern Ukrainian city of Dnpiro in a televised address yesterday. The missile is based on the RS-26 Rubezh, according to the Pentagon, a secretive missile you can read more about in detail here. Readers can also find more about what is known about the attack and Oreshnik in The War Zone's prior reporting. Better footage of the alleged impacts of multiple warheads separated from a Russian ICBM in Dnipro earlier today.&mdash; Status-6 (Military & Conflict News) (@archer83able.bsky.social) 2024-11-21T10:10:24.907Z When it comes to ballistic missiles, intercontinental range is defined as anything greater than 3,418 miles (5,500 kilometers). Short, Medium, and Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles (SRBM, MRBM, and IRBM) have ranges of 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) or less, between 620 and 1,860 miles (1,000 and 3,000 kilometers), and between 1,864 and 3,418 miles (3,000 to 5,500 kilometers), respectively. Within those categories, the exact configuration of the missile, including how many warheads it carries, conventional or nuclear, can vary significantly. The Oreshnik that Russia fired at Ukraine yesterday carried six individual warheads each with six submunitions, according to authorities in the latter country. Putin has said the weapon included unspecified 'non-nuclear hypersonic technology.' It remains unknown when the missile carried standard re-entry vehicles, maneuvering ones, or true hypersonic boost-glide vehicles. ICBMs and other larger ballistic missiles, and their payloads, typically reach substantial hypersonic speeds, generally defined as Mach 5 or above, in the course of their flight and especially while their payloads careen down to their targets. It's worth noting here that the RS-26 already represents an unusual case when it comes to categorization. Officially, Rubezh is an ICBM, but there has long been evidence that it is actually an IRBM. The RS-26 is itself understood to be a shortened derivative of the RS-24 Yars ICBM, which the U.S. government assesses to just be a variant of the preceding RS-12M Topol-M. There is already some debate also about where the Oreshnik lies on the range spectrum, with Putin calling it a medium-range weapon and American officials putting it in the IRBM category. A Russian road-mobile RS-24 Yars ICBM. Vitaly Kuzmin This all may have contributed in various ways to Ukraine's initial assessment that what Russian forces had fired was an ICBM. That being said, the concept at least of a conventionally armed ICBM is a real thing. Just last year, the U.S. military openly stated that it had assessed there to be 'possible interest in [the] development of a conventional ICBM' within China's People's Liberation Army (PLA). There have also been reports that Israel's Jericho 3, described as an ICBM, can be employed with a conventional payload. The earlier Jericho 1 short-range ballistic missile and Jericho 2 IRBM, both of which were reportedly retired in the 1990s, are also understood to have been able to carry conventional warheads, as well as nuclear ones. Israel does not publicly acknowledge the existence of its nuclear or longer-range ballistic missile arsenals. The Israeli Shavit-2 space launch rocket, seen being launched here, is reportedly tied to the country's Jericho series of ballistic missiles. Israel Ministry of Defense 'Israel is also reportedly developing the next generation of the Jericho, the Jericho 4, a three-stage missile, whose capabilities will include the possibility of carrying fragmentation warheads,' according to a report earlier this year from The Jerusalem Post. The story did not provide any further details about that missile, including a range categorization, but it points to the possibility of another Israeli long-range conventional ballistic missile capability in the works. The U.S. military has also explored similar capabilities in the past, including a possible conventionally-armed version of the Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missile, which has intercontinental range. A Trident II launch. USN The Ohio class nuclear ballistic missile submarine USS Rhode Island fires a Trident II during a routine test in 2019. USN After the Pentagon highlighted Chinese interest in a conventional ICBM in 2023, The War Zone explored the potential benefits of such a capability, writing: 'A likely goal of developing such a system for the PLA would be to have a weapon that puts strategic targets, such as air bases, ports, major command and control nodes, and seats of government, as well as symbolic ones, anywhere in the United States (or really anywhere in the world) at risk without having to escalate to the use of nuclear weapons. This could offer a powerful deterrent to non-nuclear strikes against the Chinese mainland.' 'In addition, the hope could be that if these conventional ICBMs ever had to be used the U.S. government, or any other potential nuclear-armed adversary, would be significantly less likely to retaliate with nuclear weapons.' Chinese DF-41 ICBMs, or mockups thereof, on parade. Global Times In a separate story exploring the possibility of Israel using Jerichos with conventional warheads against Iran, The War Zone further highlighted what a weapon of this kind might offer: 'Already, the Jericho missiles provide the fastest means of striking targets in Iran, and their ballistic trajectory and speed would likely render them immune to interception, especially given the very limited capabilities of Iran’s air defenses against ballistic missile threats. A subsonic cruise missile would be much easier to intercept and wouldn’t provide the option of hitting certain time-sensitive or hardened targets. And in contrast to long-range direct attacks by Israeli Air Force aircraft, no Israeli personnel would be put in harm’s way. ' 'A Jericho missile with a conventional payload would be a very capable weapon in its own right, for the above reasons and even a high-explosive warhead would be extremely destructive. According to CSIS, the Jericho 2 can carry a 3,300-pound high-explosive warhead, while the Jericho 3 has a payload capacity of between 2,200 and 2,900 pounds, although that is in a configuration that has to fly many thousands of miles, not one that has to hit a fraction of that distance. So a much larger payload could be possible if it was adapted for a regional strike profile.' 'The extreme speed that the missiles’ warheads would be traveling during their terminal attack makes them capable of targeting hardened or buried command centers and other key fortified sites to a degree the IAF isn’t capable of. This is a huge capability to consider. Israel does not have the ability to destroy Iranian nuclear facilities that are deeply buried, like the enrichment site in Fordow, via traditional aerial attack, without resorting to nuclear strikes. The United States is the only nation with a conventional air-to-ground capability that could potentially do this — the U.S. B-2 stealth bomber and its Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP). But, knowing this limitation, could Israel have created conventional penetrator warheads for its ballistic missiles that could potentially threaten these sites, at least being capable of disabling them for a period of time?' A conventional ICBM carrying multiple warheads, or even with a true multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) configuration, could offer even greater capability. A MIRVed missile with conventionally-armed re-entry vehicles with significant accuracy would allow a single missile to strike multiple impact points.

Wilson44691 via Wikimedia A payload bus from a decommissioned LGM-118A Peacekeeper ICBM now on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force with 10 mock re-entry vehicles. Wilson44691 via Wikimedia There are also clear strategic messaging benefits that would come along with a conventional ICBM capability. A successful attack with such a weapon would have the knock-on effect of very visibly demonstrating the ability to conduct a nuclear strike. Russia clearly had a desire to send signals to Ukraine, and more so to the United States and other countries supporting it, as well as demonstrate a practical capability, with its use of Oreshnik today. At the same time, while there are clear benefits to fielding a conventionally armed ICBM, they could also present worrying discrimination challenges for a defender, who would struggle to determine whether or not they were under nuclear threat. The speed at which an ICBM travels already limits the time available to assess the threat and respond in any way. All of this raises the possibility of a scenario in which an opponent, mistakenly believes they are under nuclear attack and responds in kind, which in turn could well prompt a rapidly escalating nuclear exchange. This is not an idle concern. The Pentagon has said it received advance warning of the Oreshnik attack directly from the Russians through established nuclear risk reduction channels. The notification occurred even though Russia's forces fired the missile across a relatively short distance (roughly 500 miles) at a target inside a non-nuclear state not covered by America's deterrent umbrella. Pentagon:- Russia's experimental intermediate-range ballistic missile launched at Ukraine was based on the RS-26 Rubezh ICBM model;- The US was notified by Russia about the launch briefly before it occurred through nuclear risk reduction channels.&mdash; Status-6 (Military & Conflict News) (@archer83able.bsky.social) 2024-11-21T19:57:18.465Z The same kinds of discrimination fears played a significant role in the U.S. military's previous decision to scrap work on the Conventional Trident Missile. American officials have also openly criticized China's ambiguity around their deployment of longer-range ballistic missiles capable of carrying conventional or nuclear warheads. While it has turned out that the RS-26-based Oreshnik that Russia fired at Ukraine was not a conventionally-armed ICBM, it still highlights the very real interest in, if not more active development and even potential fielding of, a weapon of that kind globally.

Anti-Personnel Landmines Included In U.S. Aid Package To Ukraine ...	The Pentagon on Thursday said that Ukraine will be receiving anti-personnel landmines for the first time as part of the latest tranche of weapons for the embattled nation. The latest Presidential Drawdown Authority Package (PDA), valued at up to $275 million was announced Wednesday. It made no specific mention of landmines but included an unspecified amount of 155mm artillery shells. The Pentagon confirmed that the mines are part of the latest PDA. That points to Ukraine likely being given artillery-fired Area Denial-Artillery-Munitions (ADAMs), designed to scatter landmines ahead of, on top of, or behind enemy forces. Several other indicators point to ADAMs. Ukraine has already received 70,000 of the anti-armor variants of the mine-dispensing shells, has the howitzers needed to fire them which require no new training and nothing else in the package seems to be a match. It is still possible that there is another type of anti-personnel mine capability is being given to Ukraine that wasn't listed, but that seems unlikely based on the factors listed above and Ukraine's urgent battlefield needs. 155mm ADAM shells come in two flavors, the M692 and M731, which both contain 36 individual mines. The rounds also function in the same way, releasing the mines out of the rear end after reaching a set point in their flight. U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command Where the M692 and M731 differ is in the specific types of mines inside. The M692 contains M67s, while the M731 has M72. The wedge-shaped mines themselves are only different in the lifespans of their internal batteries – approximately 48 hours for the M67 and just around 4 hours for the M72. Otherwise, each M67 and M72 'has eight trip wires (four on the top and four on the bottom) that deploy after ground impact up to 12 meters from the mine,' according to Army Field Manual 20-32. '[The] trip wires are similar in appearance to very fine thread; they are olive-drab green in color and weighted at the free end. A tension of 405 grams applied to one trip wire is enough to create a break in the electrical circuit and cause the mine to detonate.' Each M67 and M72 contains golf ball-sized grenade-like explosive charge designed to 'kill enemy soldiers through the combined effects of blast and fragmentation,' per the Army manual. 'Shrapnel is propelled upward and outward from the mine and produces fatal casualties to a distance of 15 meters.' It's interesting to note that the casing of each M67 and M72 continues just under 0.01 grams of depleted uranium, which is added to the resin blend to help it cure faster and more reliably. U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command There is a possibility that other U.S. anti-personnel mine types could also be included in the most recent aid package for Ukraine, but not clearly identified. The Gator family of mines, which includes anti-personnel and anti-tank mines that can be dispersed using ground-based launchers and ones installed on helicopters, as well as air-dropped cluster munitions, remains in at least limited U.S. service. Older scatterable mines and methods of emplacing them like the Ground Emplaced Mine Scattering System (GEMSS) could still be held in storage. The U.S. military also reportedly maintains a stockpile of manually-emplaced anti-personnel mines in South Korea to be used if conflict were to resume on the Peninsula. Mines in general, and anti-personnel mines especially, are very controversial, particularly due to the threat they potentially pose to civilians long after a conflict is over. The limited battery life of the M67 and M72 mines, as well as Gator mines, is intended to reduce that threat but does not inert the explosives inside the mines, which can still present a serious hazard. The 1997 Ottowa Treaty bans the stockpiling and use of anti-personnel mines, but neither the United States nor Russia is a signatory. Ukraine is a party to the agreement. However, as of 2022, the official position of the U.S. government has been to 'align &#8230; policy and practice with key provisions of the Ottawa Convention for all activities outside the context of the Korean peninsula.' U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command The decision to provide ADAMs to Ukraine was made to counter Russia’s so-called 'meat assaults' - massive waves of personnel attacking positions. These attacks have been taking place for years, but especially so now in eastern Ukraine and Russia’s Kursk region. Though Russia has been slowly gaining ground this way, it has come at an incredibly high cost in terms of personnel and equipment losses. Ukraine needs weapons that can blunt these advances, said U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. 'What we've seen most recently is because the Russians have been so unsuccessful in the way that they have been fighting they've kind of changed their tactics a bit and they don't lead with their mechanized forces anymore,' Austin told reporters in Laos on Wednesday. 'They lead with dismounted forces who are able to close in and do things to kind of pave the way for mechanized forces.' Ukraine 'has a need for things that can help slow down that effort on the part of the Russians,' he posited. You can see the results of one of those 'meat waves' in the video below. While the Ukrainians are making their own landmines, Austin pointed out that those provided by the U.S. are what’s called 'non-persistent,' meaning that in theory, they make themselves inoperable in a certain amount of time, making them safer than what Ukrainians are making on their own. Austin insisted that Ukraine has promised to be 'responsible' with these weapons, which are only to be used on Ukrainian soil. He noted that the U.S. has already provided Remote Anti-Armor Mine System (RAAMs) projectiles, which are the anti-tank variant of these munitions. In addition to more than three million conventional 155mm artillery rounds, the U.S. has shipped more than 70,000 RAAMs to Ukraine, according to the Pentagon’s latest statistics. 'We've talked to them about how they would potentially employ these weapons and make sure that they're doing things responsibly - recording where they're putting their mines and making sure that they take advantage of the self-detonating qualities of these weapons.' The U.S., however, will have limited oversight in how Ukraine deploys the ADAMs, the Pentagon’s Deputy Press Secretary told reporters, including from The War Zone, Thursday afternoon. 'We're not tracking it in terms of where they place them, but certainly they have given us their assurances that they will be employed in a way that protects civilians,' Sabrina Singh explained. 'They have committed that they're going to use these mines in their own territory. And I should have added that they're not going to use them in populated areas.' Ukrainians have an interest in scattering these landmines as safely as possible, Singh noted. After the war, Ukraine 'is going to have to conduct a massive demining effort …to remove any unexploded ordinance, both from the landmines that Russia has put in place, and also to any anything else that has been used on the battlefield.' They are already doing this even under heavy Russian pressure along much of the battlefield, which includes large swaths of land littered with Russian mines. During Ukraine's failed 2023 counteroffensive, President Volodymyr Zelensk said 200,000 sq km (77,220 sq miles) of Ukrainian territory had been mined by Russian forces, slowing down advances. 'We've already seen them conduct this type of operation in some of the territory that they've recaptured,' Singh pointed out. 'The U.S. is committed to supporting them and to helping them with what they need in those key mining efforts.' As we recently noted, last month was the deadliest of the war for Russia, according to the U.K. Defense Intelligence Directorate. The average daily number of Russian troops killed and wounded was 1,354, it stated, citing Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff statistics. For the month, there were 41,900 casualties, eclipsing the previous record of 39,100 from May. November is off to an even bloodier start, with an average of 1,498 killed and wounded as of Nov. 12. All told, Russia has lost upwards of 700,000 killed and wounded, those statistics show. It’s worth noting that casualty numbers vary widely depending on the source and The War Zone cannot independently verify them.

That has placed an enormous burden on outmanned Ukrainian troops. With this in mind, the objective of providing ADAMs to Ukraine is to add to Russia’s mounting casualty count, reduce its forces ability to freely maneuver, and to slow what has been in some areas a grinding advance. All of this would assist in reducing the pressure the Russian military is apply at flashpoints along the front lines. With Donald Trump coming into office in two months, some form of negotiations are very likely approaching. Every inch Ukraine loses now it is unlikely to get back if the a perspective deal includes freezing the lines where they are, as many believe it would. Still, the move to supply anti-personnel mines to the Ukraine is an unprecedented one for the U.S. and underlines the precarious state of the conflict.

The Story Of Russia’s Secretive RS-26 Intermediate Range Ballisti...	The Russian missile at the center of an unprecedented strike on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro earlier today has been identified by Russia’s President Vladimir Putin as an alleged new weapon, named Oreshnik. After the strike, the missile had been widely — although not conclusively — identified as the RS-26 Rubezh. Development work on this mysterious strategic weapon system was supposed halted in 2018, although the Pentagon now states that whatever missile was used today in Dnipro was based on the RS-26, suggesting the design was revived at least to a degree, and has now been used in combat. You can read our initial report on the Dnipro missile strike here, as well as our analysis of Putin’s claims around the Oreshnik — described as a medium-range or intermediate-range 'hypersonic' missile — here. Note: The missile shown at the top of this story is the RS-24 Yars intercontinental ballistic missile, a weapon on which the RS-26 is widely assessed to be based. First off, it’s worth recalling that the RS-26 is widely viewed as an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), a class of weapon that has a range of somewhere between approximately 1,860 and 3,410 miles — based on the ranges it achieved in tests. However, Russia has previously described it as an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), a type of weapon that can hit targets at more than around 3,410 miles. Ok, two reasons why I think Russia probably used a variant of the long-gestating RS-26 Rubezh IRBM: (1) Russia hinted that it resumed development of the RS-26 this summer and (2) that's what the Ukrainians predicated a day ago, down to the launch site. Dr. Jeffrey Lewis (@ArmsControlWonk) November 21, 2024 The reason for this discrepancy likely lies primarily in Russia having sought to remain within the limits of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, which outlawed ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges of 500 to 5,500 kilometers (310 and 3,410 miles). The INF collapsed in 2019. Some reports mentioned the RS-26 missile. Even if we believe them, RS-26 is not really an intercontinental missile. It was tested at the range of more than 5500 km, but it is in effect an intermediate-range missile, (think of it as SS-20 2.0): russianforces.org/blog/2017/07&#8230; 2/&mdash; Pavel Podvig (@russianforces.org) 2024-11-21T10:11:00.678Z However, it could explain why the Ukrainian military initially reported that the missile that struck Dnipro was an ICBM — a claim that many Western officials subsequently denied, pointing instead to the RS-26 or an RS-26 derivative. Regardless, there is now a growing consensus that the missile used was a conventionally armed IRBM based on the RS-26. The launch site appears to have been Kapustin Yar, roughly 500 miles from the target. As for the RS-26, this is a solid-fueled, road-mobile missile that has been described in the past as a smaller derivative of the RS-24 Yars ICBM, although the exact relationship is unclear. Development of the RS-26 began around 2008 by the Moscow Institute of Thermal Technology. The missile is reportedly around 39 feet long and has a diameter of just under six feet. A road-mobile RS-24 Yars ICBM, from which the Russians reportedly developed the RS-26. Vitaly Kuzmin A first, unsuccessful test launch occurred at Plesetsk in September 2011. In a second test in May 2012, Russia demonstrated that the RS-26 could reach an intercontinental range, although it was widely assumed that this was only achieved with a light payload or no payload at all. Subsequent tests strongly indicated the missile couldn't fly beyond intermediate ranges with an actual warhead, which would have put it in contravention of the INF had it been fielded operationally prior to 2019. Amid this controversy, Russia had officially pulled the plug on the potentially treaty-busting RS-26 in 2018. In March of that year, only weeks after Russian President Vladimir Putin mentioned it in a provocative speech, Russia reportedly decided to shelve the development of the Rubezh, dropping it from the state armament plan for 2018 to 2027. Instead, the country would focus on fielding the nuclear-armed Avangard hypersonic boost-glide vehicle weapon. Previously, Putin had stated that the RS-26 would also serve as the primary launch vehicle for Avangard. A Russian Ministry of Defense video reportedly showing Avangard prototypes and a computer-generated depiction of its operational concept. 'The Avangard was included in the [state armament plan] program’s final version as more essential to ensure the country’s defense capability,' a Russian defense industry source said, according to state-run media outlet TASS. 'All the work on the Rubezh and the Barguzin [rail-mobile ICBM] was put on hold until the end of 2027. A decision on the work’s resumption will be made after the current armament program is fulfilled.' Without the RS-26, the Avangard has instead been fielded in a silo-based form loaded onto repurposed rocket boosters from old UR-100N UTTKh ICBMs. The hypersonic boost-glide vehicle may also become a payload option for the silo-launched RS-28 Sarmat ICBM, which has had a troubled development. There is clear evidence that a new RS-28 test launch earlier ended in disaster. A test launch of the RS-28 Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile. Russian Ministry of Defense screencap www.twz.com It was unclear exactly why Russia abandoned the RS-26, although it may simply have been a financial decision, especially with competition from a range of other advanced strategic capabilities the country is also pursuing. Cost concerns were certainly raised in the TASS reporting in 2018. 'It was initially planned to include both the Avangard and the [RS-26] Rubezh in the state armament plan,' the anonymous defense industry source told TASS. 'It became clear later that funds would not suffice to finance both systems at a time.' There may have been other issues, as well. After all, prior to being mentioned again in 2018, there had been scant official mention of the RS-26 at all for years. The Kremlin was supposed to demonstrate the system to arms control inspectors from the United States first in 2015 and then in 2016, but both of these inspections were missed. However, in a 2021 report, the Pentagon stated that, despite the reports in the Russian press, work on the RS-26 and testing of associated equipment continued at least into 2018. With the demise of INF and the deepening tensions between Russia and NATO, it could be that Moscow has revisited the RS-26, perhaps in the form of the Oreshnik, although there is no evidence that either missile has so far been operationally deployed. Asked for his reflections on the Dnipro strike, and prior to the Oreshnik disclosure, Pavel Podvig, a Senior Researcher in the WMD Program at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR), told TWZ that the missile used could have been an RS-26 — employed on an experimental basis — or perhaps some new type of missile in the same class. If that were the case, the new missile, Oreshnik or otherwise, would likely be very similar to the RS-26, according to Podvig’s assessment. We don't know yet what this is and I leave it to the true OSINT experts to determine the novelty of the missile.But I'd be shocked if Russia managed to build an MIRVed MRBM without relying to at least 90% on an existing designs and cannibalizing RS-26 (or other missile) parts… Fabian Hoffmann (@FRHoffmann1) November 21, 2024 As to the likelihood of Russia having returned to developing IRBMs, more generally, Podvig says it’s 'entirely possible' that Russia might have revived the RS-26 program. 'I wouldn’t be surprised if there was some effort to create a missile that would be kind of similar to RS-26, or SS-20 and things like that. I would not be surprised if design bureaus started putting together a project of that kind,' he added. There is also the possibility that, if a version of the RS-26 was used, this was simply a case of using up one of the non-operational or even prototype rounds in a combat mission, albeit now rebranded as Oreshnik. The combination of range to target (roughly 500 miles), the ability to evade Ukrainian air defenses, and the powerful signaling may simply have been too tempting for Russia. The RS-26 program was mothballed in 2018 russianforces.org/blog/2018/04&#8230; One cannot rule out that RS-26 was taken out of its &#034;retirement&#034; for a strike. This implies that Russia had a number of these missiles in storage for almost ten years. Not impossible, but rather unlikely. 3/&mdash; Pavel Podvig (@russianforces.org) 2024-11-21T10:11:00.679Z At the same time, using an IRBM of any kind for an operational strike will also provide Russia with very valuable information. After all, no ICBM or IRBM has ever been used in combat before. While the precise identity of the missile used remains a mystery for now, it’s also unclear what kind of payload it was carrying. When it was developed, the RS-26 was expected to carry either a single nuclear warhead or a nuclear multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) payload — both options were tested in 2013. The Avangard was, for a while, also seen as an RS-26 payload. Clearly, the missile that targeted Dnipro was either conventionally armed or perhaps, unarmed. Videos of the strike show what appears to be six warheads hurtling toward the ground, consistent with MIRVs. The Ukrainian Air Force confirmed that Russia struck the Ukrainian city of Dnipro with a conventionally armed ICBM this morning, marking the first combat use of an ICBM in history. Footage from Dnipro showed glowing reentry vehicles hitting the ground around 5 AM local time. pic.twitter.com/PWTGajH9bT&mdash; OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) November 21, 2024 Podvig told us that an unarmed RS-26 (or similar IRBM) is 'not entirely impossible,' but also raised the possibility of the missile being fitted with small explosive warheads. There is also the potential that the missile was carrying decoys or a combination of small conventional warheads and decoys. No big visible explosions indicate small warheads6 groups of 6 projectiles means that you likely had 6 missiles with 6 large submunitions eachWhile this can be ie 3 MIRVs in inert configuration and 3 heavy decoys I think the simpler explanation would be 6 heavy submunitions.&mdash; krakek (@krakek1) November 21, 2024 A conventionally armed IRBM is an interesting proposition and it’s not clear if this would have been developed specifically for this strike, or for use in Ukraine more generally, or if it might reflect a broader interest in Russia to field conventional versions of its strategic missiles. Russia is not known to have looked at developing conventionally armed IRBMs/ICBMs, although, in the past, TWZ has looked at the potential arguments for doing just that — albeit in the case of Israel. Amid a worsening crisis involving Iran, we examined the possibility of Israel launching an attack using a conventionally armed version of its Jericho IRBM — best known as a launch vehicle for the Israeli nuclear deterrent. The same arguments could apply to Russia, which might want to make an extremely powerful show of force in the hope of signaling to the West that it should not become more deeply involved in the war in Ukraine. This is especially true for deterring the U.S. and its partners from allowing expanded targeting for its donated weapons inside of Russian borders. It's a signal. Whatever RS-26 true range or purpose, it's classified by Russia as a &#034;strategic&#034; system. Its use is meant to cross a threshold. And seems highly likely it is intended to mirror ATACMS use in Russia.&mdash; Shashank Joshi (@shashj.bsky.social) 2024-11-21T09:27:05.796Z Tellingly, soon after the United States and other allies last week allowed Ukraine to launch long-range missiles into Russia, officials in Moscow warned that they might use a weapon never previously employed on Ukrainian territory. Using a conventionally armed IRBM may well be a response in kind to that decision by the relevant Western powers. Not only is such a missile immune to Ukrainian air defenses but it also delivers a very robust message and one that will resonate across Europe. After all, this is a missile that can reach targets anywhere in the continent and which, on another day, could be topped with a nuclear warhead. If the missile was indeed filled with decoys and perhaps didn’t even carry highly-destructive conventional warheads, that would very much point to signaling being the desired effect. On the other hand, a high-explosive warhead would be extremely destructive and might well be selected for a particularly important or heavily defended target. Should Russia want to target hardened or buried command centers and other key fortified sites in Ukraine, then it might call upon the same types of missiles again — provided they are available in sufficient numbers. Even demonstrating such a capability is significant, since Ukraine’s air defenses mean that Russia could use such missiles to strike anywhere in the country with impunity. Again, if a conventional warhead can be used in this way, the implications of using a nuclear warhead become obvious. Russian war planners would have to weigh all this up against the possibility that Ukraine and NATO might misconstrue an incoming conventionally armed IRBM as a nuclear one. However, it should be recalled that all of the ballistic and cruise missiles launched against Ukraine so far by Russia also have the capability to carry nuclear payloads. As we suspected, it is now widely understood that Russia warned the U.S. of its intended strike by a conventionally armed strategic weapon prior to launch. Ultimately, we will need to wait for more evidence to determine the relationship between the RS-26 and the Oreshnik. It seems certain, however, that Russia has launched an unprecedented attack — and one that does not have a historical parallel.

Pros And Cons Of The Navy’s Controversial Submarine-Launched Nucl...	As President-elect Donald Trump nears his return to the White House, the U.S. Navy’s nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missile (SLCM-N) program started during his first term is potentially returning to the spotlight as well. It remains unclear whether Trump’s second term will put wind in the sails for the program, which President Joe Biden proposed canceling in the 2022 Nuclear Posture Review. Questions remain about whether the deterrent juice is worth the financial and resource squeeze to field SLCM-N and its warhead in the next decade, and the potential role it could play in escalating hostilities, not lessening them. Concerns also persist about whether it will irrevocably change the very nature of the American attack submarine force, and if all those dollars could be better spent elsewhere. While the Navy has proceeded with standing up the program as required by Congress, sea service leaders have increasingly expressed concern about whether it’s a wise allocation of finite resources. And despite Biden White House and Navy hesitancy, Congress has continued to fund the program. But supporters argue that SLCM-N would provide a much-needed sea-based nuclear deterrent that is a rung below the strategic level on the nuclear warfare ladder, and that the commander-in-chief is owed a bevy of such options. Like its predecessor, the U.S. Navy’s scuppered nuclear-armed Tomahawk Land Attack Missile-Nuclear (TLAM-N), SLCM-N is envisioned as a lower-yield nuclear weapon launched from subs that would provide a new dimension to the maritime portion of the nuclear triad while allowing the United States to proportionately respond to a limited nuclear strike by an adversary. The guided-missile cruiser USS Monterey (CG 61) fires a Tomahawk land attack missile on April 14, 2018. (U.S. Navy) Seaman Trey Fowler 'It’s part of an overall ability to build a flexible reaction, flexible deterrent,' Bradley Martin, a retired Navy surface warfare officer and current senior policy researcher at the RAND think tank, told The War Zone. 'Being sea-based, it does allow concealment and less vulnerability than there might be if it’s sitting on an attack aircraft someplace.' Meanwhile, a Navy request for information published on November 15 offers some of the most specific information released to date about how the Navy envisions outfitting SLCM-N in the Virginia class attack submarine fleet. The RFI is part of Navy 'market research' focused 'on rapid development, integration, and demonstration' of an SLCM-N 'all-up round,' or a missile delivered ready to load onto an attack submarine. It seeks white papers featuring industry perspectives 'on either weapon system integration, cruise missile prototype development, or cruise missile subsystems.' The request further notes that all nuclear warhead installation and missile storage, as well as missile onloading and offloading, will take place at existing ballistic missile submarine facilities at Kings Bay, Georgia, and Bangor, Washington. Any prototype must be able to be launched from a 87-inch Virginia Payload Tube, a Virginia Payload Module, or both. The Virginia Payload Tubes are mounted forward of the sail and house vertical launch cells for cruise missiles (primarily). The Virginia Payload Module will be installed on new Virginia class submarines and is large four tube vertical launch system structure that is installed amidships. (U.S. Navy) The Navy is also looking for missiles that are 'as modular as possible,' including software and hardware, so that changes to the core missile body or common tactical systems don’t require changes to warhead payload interfaces or avionics 'associated with the nuclear mission.' 'This open system approach is being pursued to allow for future technical insertion or technology upgrades as required through the life of the SLCM-N program,' the Navy’s request states. The request also seeks the ability to break the missile into nuclear and non-nuclear parts. 'Technology proposed for the SLCM-N flight system must be producible and fieldable to meet an FY 2034 initial operational capability,' the RFI states. 'However, prototypes will be required within 3 years.' Still, much remains unclear about how this missile system will eventually manifest. The Navy has not released details regarding how many missiles it would plan to buy or the work that will be required to outfit submarines with the system. Even basing them at Trident facilities, which primarily host nuclear ballistic submarines, seems like a major hurdle to deploying them regularly. The Congressional Budget Office estimated in July 2023 that the SLCM-N and its warhead could cost $10 billion from 2023 to 2032, and that such costs don’t include 'systems integration, storage or operations.' Count Vice Adm. Johnny Wolfe, director of the Navy Strategic Systems Programs (NSSP), is one of the SLCM-N skeptics. Wolfe’s office overseas the seaborne leg of America’s nuclear triad. Speaking at the Navy Submarine League’s annual conference last week, Wolfe called existing plans to reach initial capability for SLCM-N by 2034 'a very, very aggressive timeline,' Sydney J. Freedberg Jr. of Breaking Defense reported. According to that outlet, Wolfe also warned in his conference remarks that the program would basically require an entire new workforce and industrial base, at a time when the Navy and American defense giants are struggling to deliver new ships and get existing ships out of maintenance on time. 'This is truly a capability we have to build from the ground up,' Breaking Defense quoted Wolfe as saying. Wolfe also quashed the idea of the Navy simply recreating a nuclear Tomahawk from the Cold War era. 'We can’t reconstitute that, okay?' Breaking Defense quoted Wolfe as saying. 'It’s not that easy.' A Navy spokesperson later confirmed to Breaking Defense that Wolfe was referring to producing an appropriate missile, and not the nuclear warhead, which would be the responsibility of the U.S. Energy Department. 'The requirement to deliver SLCM-N would increase the capacity requirement amongst industry to a level that had not previously been accounted for,' the spokesperson said, according to Breaking Defense. Sailors assigned to the submarine tender USS Emory S. Land (AS 39) weapons handling division conduct an offload of a Tomahawk missile from the Los Angeles-class fast-attack submarine USS Asheville (SSN 758) in Guam in 2022. (U.S. Navy) Petty Officer 1st Class Victoria Kinney While some brass has expressed skepticism over the program, the Biden administration also warned in July 2023 of the trade-offs in going forward with SLCM-N. Namely, in a policy statement, the White House said that deploying the system 'would reduce capacity for conventional strike munitions, create additional burdens on naval training, maintenance and operations, and could create additional risks to the Navy’s ability to operate in key regions,' according to a report this month on the program by the Congressional Research Service. Indeed, taking SLCM-N to sea would require standing up a bevy of new Navy systems and protocols, as deploying and supporting nuclear weapons is a different reality compared to conventional munitions. New security protocols and personnel would have to be deployed. Highly specific surveillance and maintenance requirements would have to be enacted. This is in addition to specialized and highly secure communications systems needing to be installed and sustained in order to receive nuclear strike orders through proper channels. Such a capability would also require additional vetting and training of sailors assigned to such vessels. 'It’s perfectly valid to say there’s considerable costs that would go with putting this on a SSN,' Martin said. 'There would be security protocols, command-and-control protocols that would have to be added.' Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro also warned in testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee in May that the program would 'fundamentally change the mission of many of these submarines themselves.' Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro testifies to the Senate Armed Services Committee in May. (U.S. Navy) Petty Officer 2nd Class Jared Mancuso Del Toro noted that the Navy had stood up an SLCM-N program management office as required by law, but that he remained concerned that the program would 'operationally impact' Navy submarines’ ability to do their jobs in the Pacific and elsewhere. 'That actually will prevent us perhaps from doing the things that we need to do tactically and operationally, by providing this SLCM capability to the submarine.' Del Toro also noted how this 'multi-billion dollar program' will prevent the naval enterprise from taking on other pricey priorities. The Navy said in 2022 that canceling the effort would save the service nearly $200 million in Fiscal Year 2023 alone, and $2.1 billion in the next five years, according to the CRS. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has also questioned the effort, testifying that year that 'the marginal capability that [the SLCM-N] provides is far outweighed by the cost,' the CRS notes. But supporters of the program argue that the main reason for American subs in the first place is deterrence, and giving the president an additional submarine-launched tactical nuclear option has major advantages. The U.S. Navy has already fielded a lower-yield nuclear strike option in the form of the W76-2 warhead loaded onto an unspecified number of Ohio class nuclear ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs), boats that are already set up to fire nuclear weapons. Concerns over an adversary not knowing if a Trident launch is packing a low-yield or much more powerful payload is also an issue. The cruise missile delivery system fired by SSNs solves this issue to some degree, but also introduces others in terms of strategic ambiguity. If these boats can fire nuclear-armed cruise missiles, then will any cruise missile be interpreted as such during a crisis? Still, proponents think fielding the weapon is worth the effort. It provides 'significant flexibility to manage a crisis,' Franklin C. Miller, a former senior defense official and National Security Council staffer, wrote in Real Clear Defense this summer. And while it doesn’t these days, the U.S. Navy’s non-ballistic missile-equipped fleet does have a history of carrying nuclear weapons, Miller writes. 'Throughout the Cold War, U.S. carriers deployed with nuclear gravity bombs and ASW weapons; surface combatants carried a range of nuclear-tipped anti-air and ASW weapons; and SSNs carried nuclear-tipped torpedoes and the SUBROC ASW systems,' he writes. 'From the 1980s until the end of the Cold War, surface ships and SSNs also carried nuclear Tomahawks (and those nuclear Tomahawks contributed significantly to deterring Soviet nuclear attacks on our aircraft carriers).' The battleship USS Missouri fires a Tomahawk missile. (U.S. Navy) Several military leaders have also echoed the contention that the commander–in-chief should have several tailored tactical nuclear weapons options at their disposal. Miller cites repeated testimony by Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti saying that 'SLCM-N is a tailored option the President should have,' while a recent CRS report notes then-Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley expressed support for SLCM-N to Congress in April 2022, noting that the president 'deserves to have multiple options.' Of course, the President does have multiple options outside the Navy’s leg of the nuclear triad. The Air Force has B-61 tactical nuclear bombs that currently equip certain fighters and B-2 bombers, which are highly flexible assets that can deal with broadcasting strategic intent and executing proportional strikes if called upon to do so. That service also has air-launched nuclear cruise missiles in its arsenal. As President-elect Trump’s inauguration nears, and his politically appointed defense and Navy secretaries get to work, whether SLCM-N will return to prominence remains to be seen, but considering the program was born out of his last administration, it’s a definite possibility. At the least, it’s a program that warrants 'a really careful look,' Martin said. 'It’s costly and it definitely would create operational challenges and considerations for submarines,' he told The War Zone. 'Is there a deterrent effect, and is it useful? Does it cause adversaries to think differently? If so, it potentially is worth the cost.'

Russia’s Experimental Ballistic Missile Used To Strike Ukraine Is...	We are now getting details about the weapon used in the unprecedented attack on Ukraine earlier today, with Russian President Vladimir Putin saying his country's forces fired a previously unknown medium-range 'hypersonic' missile called Oreshnik. The new missile is based on the previous RS-26 Rubezh ballistic missile, according to the Pentagon. Readers can get up to speed on what else is already known about the missile strike on the eastern Ukrainian city of Dnipro in The War Zone's initial reporting here. Ukrainain authorities had initially claimed that the weapon Russia fired today was an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Subsequent reports citing anonymous U.S. government officials have said that it was actually a medium or intermediate-range ballistic missile (MRBM/IRBM). The RS-26 is officially categorized as an ICBM, but experts have long assessed that it is more likely an IRBM. MRBMs, IRBMs, and ICBMs are categorized by their maximum ranges – between 620 and 1,860 miles (1,000 and 3,000 kilometers), between 1,864 and 3,418 miles (3,000 to 5,500 kilometers), and greater than 3,418 miles (5,500 kilometers), respectively. 'In response to the use of American and British weaponry on November 21 this year, Russian armed forces conducted a combined strike on one of Ukraine's defense-industrial complex facilities,' Putin said in a televised address. 'This included testing one of Russia's latest medium-range missile systems in combat conditions. In this case, a ballistic missile equipped with non-nuclear hypersonic technology, referred to as Oreshnik by our missile forces.' Statement by the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir PutinWatch herein in full (dubbed in English) pic.twitter.com/mF5SCJdlq1&mdash; MFA Russia (@mfa_russia) November 21, 2024 'Targets for engagement during further testing of our newest missile complexes will be determined based on threats to the security of the Russian Federation,' he added. 'When selecting targets for such systems as Oreshnik on Ukrainian territory, we will ensure that civilians, as well as citizens of friendly nations present in those areas, are advised to leave potential danger zones in advance. This will be done openly, publicly, and out of humanitarian considerations, without fear of opposition from the enemy.' In his remarks, Putin said that Oreshnik (which means 'hazel' in Russian, keeping with the country's tradition of naming ballistic missiles after trees) had a peak speed of Mach 10, but provided no other details about the weapon. He also made no mention of any connection to the RS-26, work on which was publicly shelved in 2018. Imagery from today's attack on Ukraine looks to show six warheads descending on the target and multiple resulting impacts. Better footage of the alleged impacts of multiple warheads separated from a Russian ICBM in Dnipro earlier today.&mdash; Status-6 (Military & Conflict News) (@archer83able.bsky.social) 2024-11-21T10:10:24.907Z 'I can confirm that Russia did launch an experimental intermediate-range ballistic missile,' Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said at a routine press conference today. 'This IRBM was based on Russia's RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile model' Pentagon:- Russia's experimental intermediate-range ballistic missile launched at Ukraine was based on the RS-26 Rubezh ICBM model;- The US was notified by Russia about the launch briefly before it occurred through nuclear risk reduction channels.&mdash; Status-6 (Military & Conflict News) (@archer83able.bsky.social) 2024-11-21T19:57:18.465Z Singh added that the U.S. government had been notified about the launch beforehand through Nuclear Risk Reduction channels. We raised this very real possibility in our initial report. This contradicts separate remarks from Dmitry Peskov, spokesperson for Putin, who said today that Russia has no obligation to make such notification for launches of medium-range weapons. Russia did not send advance notifications to the United States or other countries about the use of the Oreshnik hypersonic missile on a Ukrainian military-industrial facility as there are no such obligations, Dmitry Peskov told TASS: pic.twitter.com/ieldbKB8hM&mdash; TASS (@tassagency_en) November 21, 2024 'Russia launched an experimental intermediate-range ballistic missile against Ukraine,' another U.S. government official also told The War Zone directly. 'While we take all threats against Ukraine seriously, it is important to keep a few key facts in mind. Russia likely possesses only a handful of these experimental missiles.' The RS-26 is itself reportedly a smaller derivative of the RS-24 Yars ICBM. Rubezh is also understood to have a multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) configuration and was associated in the past with the development of the Avangard hypersonic boost-glide vehicle. Russia has publicly fielded Avangard in a silo-based configuration using a repurposed ICBM rocketed booster. Hypersonic boost-glide vehicles offer capabilities that are particularly hard to defend against, as you can read more about here. The video below shows an Avangard test in 2018. Whether Oreshnik carries standard re-entry vehicles, maneuvering ones, or true hypersonic boost-glide vehicles remains unknown. Larger ballistic missiles and their payloads, in general, typically reach hypersonic speeds. A picture said to show a piece of the Oreshnik after the attack looks to be a part that is also found in the Bulava submarine-launched ballistic missile and that is linked to the production of components for other Russian strategic ballistic missiles. 1/2 Just a small bit of OSINT on Russia's new 'Oreshnik' MRBM, allegedly used to strike Dnipro (per Putin): I found the exactly the same part on the Russian govt procurement site.

The war has already seen the first operational use of the Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile and the sea-launched Zircon air-breathing hypersonic cruise missile In addition, the introduction of a new ostensibly hypersonic weapon comes amid continued efforts to bolter Ukraine's air and missile defenses. Western-supplied Patriot surface-to-air missile systems have been notably effective against Kinzhal, as well as ground-launched ballistic missiles. At a peak speed of Mach 10, Oreshnik would be moving faster than a system like Patriot can reliably intercept. 'Existing modern air defense systems worldwide, including the missile defense systems created by Americans in Europe, cannot intercept such missiles. It’s impossible,' Putin explicitly boasted in his announcement about Oreshnik today. Using an experimental and expensive capability like Oreshnik, which also likely has lower accuracy in its conventional mode than existing long-range munitions that Russia has been using on Ukraine, is also clearly intended to send broader messages to Ukraine's foreign benefactors. Putin has not explicitly said it was in retaliation for Ukraine getting approval to employ U.S.-made Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) short-range ballistic missiles and British-supplied Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missiles against targets in Russia. 'Ukraine has withstood countless attacks from Russia, including from missiles with significantly larger warheads than this weapon. Let me be clear: Russia may be seeking to use this capability to try to intimidate Ukraine and its supporters, or generate attention in the information space, but it will not be a game-changer in this conflict,' the aforementioned U.S. government official told The War Zone. 'We briefed Ukraine and close allies/partners in recent days about Russia’s possible use of this weapon to help them prepare.' 'As the President announced earlier this year, the United States is providing Ukraine with hundreds of additional Patriot and AMRAAM missiles to strengthen its air defenses. Many of these air defense missiles have been delivered already, as a consequence of the President's decision to divert air defense exports to Ukraine, and deliveries of additional air defense missiles to Ukraine are ongoing,' they continued. 'And, as the President directed in September, the United States will continue to surge security assistance to Ukraine to strengthen capabilities, including air defense, and put Ukraine in the best possible position on the battlefield. Just yesterday, we announced another security assistance package and those efforts will continue until the end of the President’s term.' With Putin's threat to continue employing Oreshniks, more information about the missile and its RS-26 predecessor may now start to emerge.

Russia’s Unprecedented Ballistic Missile Attack On Ukraine: What ...	The Ukrainian Air Force claims that Russia launched a conventionally armed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) today at the city of Dnipro, in the center of the country. They offered no proof and some U.S. and Western officials are pushing back on the specific ICBM claim, stating that an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) was used. In either case, the act is unprecedented for the war in Ukraine and it would mark the first use of either one of these types of weapons in combat anywhere. Officials in Moscow had previously warned they might use a weapon never previously employed on Ukrainian territory, in response to the United States and other allies last week allowing Ukraine to fire long-range missiles into Russia. Among the conflicting claims about exactly what kind of missile was used, but it appears that it was a ballistic missile with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) capability. Videos emerging on social media show what appears to be six warheads hurtling toward the ground and multiple impacts as a result. This analysis could change as more information comes available.

'In particular, an intercontinental ballistic missile was launched from the Astrakhan region of the Russian Federation.' The Air Force added that eight ballistic and cruise missiles were also fired in this attack. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky hedged that claim a bit. 'Today, it was a new Russian missile. Its speed and altitude suggest intercontinental ballistic capabilities,' he said on X. 'Investigations are ongoing.'

'Let them reject it,' he told The War Zone. 'Do not call the rocket — it has arrived!' There are claims, as yet unverified, that Russia might have used its RS-26 Rubezh missile.

Still, it's worth noting that doing so would have required a very steep parabolic flight profile similar to what we see North Korea use for many of its test launches.

The maximum was about 11,000 kilometers [6,800 miles]. So I think it is entirely possible and shouldn’t be a problem for modern ICBMs, like Topol-M or Yars, they should be able to do 800 kilometers [500 miles]. If we’re talking about RS-26 then it’s even less of a problem, because, of course, it is a shorter-range missile, an intermediate-range missile, and so 800 kilometers would be perfectly within its capabilities. But we don’t know what kind of missile it is at this point.' Bearing in mind the fact that Russia has previously described the RS-26 as an ICBM, it could be that this is the descriptor that Ukraine is using, as well. In the meantime, U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey referred to reports that Russia had fired 'a new ballistic missile into Ukraine,' which could also apply to the RS-26, or a related missile. 'The way it worked with RS-26 for example, was that the project was kind of stopped sometime in the mid-2010s,' Podvig added. 'So maybe it could be a new type, similar to the RS-26, or maybe he meant that the RS-26 has never been deployed, has never been operational. So any kind of operational [RS-26] missile would be a missile of a new type. That’s hard to tell, but basically, there is not much you can do in terms of new types. The easiest thing is to take what they did before — using the stages from Yars — and basically make an RS-26 kind of missile.' As to whether the RS-26 program might have been revived, Podvig considers that a definite possibility. 'It is entirely possible that they are just going to revive the program,' Podvig said. 'That is possible, especially after the demise of the INF Treaty, I wouldn’t be surprised if there was some effort to create a missile that would be kind of similar to the RS-26, or SS-20 and things like that. That’s my take. I would not be surprised if design bureaus started putting together a project of that kind.' Hans Kristensen, Director of the Nuclear Information Project, Federation of American Scientists, added his thoughts on the possible missile used, in a post on X. 'Claim of Russian use of ICBM against Ukraine was not correct,' he tweeted. 'Something else and speculations it might have been RS-26 canceled years ago. Launch location should tell us more. They might just have seen an opportunity to test a prototype.' That didn’t take long. Claim of Russian use of ICBM against Ukraine was not correct.

However, such weapons can provide a tactical advantage and certainly showcase a strategic message. Intercepting multiple warheads at the speed and angle of these weapons in the terminal phase is beyond what Ukraine's donated Patriot batteries can defend against. Defeating these weapons requires a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) or Aegis Ashore air defense system, David Shank, a retired Army colonel and former commandant of the Army Air Defense Artillery School at Ft. Sill, Oklahoma told us. The Ground-based Midcourse Defense missile defense system (GMD) would work best, he added. Ukraine has none of these systems. All the hubbub about nuclear threats means a lot of you are missing the fact that Russia may have just demonstrated a capability to strike strategic targets in Europe like airbases with a high impact cluster munition that evades 99% of NATO's air defense inventory.&mdash; Decker Eveleth (@dexeve.bsky.social) 2024-11-21T15:18:44.288Z Deploying these weapons also sends a message that Russia is willing to take another step up the escalation ladder in the wake of having its territory struck by U.S.-donated ground-launched Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) and U.K.-donated air-launched Storm Shadow long-range missiles. 'The strike itself proves: Russia does not seek peace,' Heorhil Tykhi, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry stated on X. 'To the contrary, it makes every effort to expand the war.'

Watch A Ukrainian Uncrewed Aerial Mothership Launch Kamikaze Dron...	Ukraine's domestically developed Dovbush T10 drone has taken on a new role acting as a mothership for first-person view (FPV) kamikaze quadcopters. In this configuration, the T10 also serves as a key signal relay node between the highly maneuverable one-way-attackers and their operators. Serhii Beskrestnov recently posted video, seen below, of an apparent test of a mothership T10 carrying two FPV kamikaze drones, one under each wing, on his Telegram channel. Beskrestnov (sometimes referred to by the pseudonyms Serhii Flash or Flesh; his first name can also be found written as Serhiy) is a Ukrainian servicemember who has been cited as an expert in 'radio technologies' and other military electronics. He regularly posts about new uncrewed aerial systems, electronic warfare, and other battlefield developments.

I find the way the FPV is attached to the wing amusing. The bomb acts as an adapter between the mothership and the FPV-Kamikaze. And the FPV itself hangs upside down&mdash; Special Kherson Cat (@specialkhersoncat.bsky.social) 2024-11-19T22:51:22.863Z In his Telegram post, Beskrestnov did not provide more details about the T10 mothership's capabilities, including its range and endurance and how far the FPVs can reach after launch. The T10 first emerged in late 2022 configured as a surveillance and reconnaissance platform with an unspecified sensor package and a reported range of just under 22 miles (35 kilometers). The drone can also be employed as a one-way-attacker with a nearly 26-and-a-half-pound (12-kilogram) warhead. In its baseline configuration, the design reportedly costs around $12,000. The T10's primary mode of launch appears to be via a rack installed on the top of a pickup truck, which gets it up to a suitable speed to fly off on its own. How it might be recovered after a mission is unclear. The design reportedly features a navigation package that can fall back in some way on inertial navigation system (INS) guidance if its GPS signal is jammed, something that is a major threat on the battlefield in Ukraine. At its most basic level, the T10 mothership offers a way to maximize the reach of typically short-range FPV drones by releasing them at the edge of its own combat radius. The FPVs also gain extra loiter time, which they could spend on identifying and/or maneuvering to their targets, or even waving off an initial attack run and coming back from a different, unexpected vector. Putting the signal relay on the mothership orbiting above also puts that node closer to where the FPVs are actually operating, making it easier to maintain connectivity.

AI-enabled targeting capabilities would be a huge boon for FPVs, especially in the terminal phase of flight, where human operators currently have to manually find targets and steer the drone into them. You can read more about the game-changing impacts AI is set to have on drone operations in this War Zone feature. However, blending launch platform and signal relay in a single mothership package already helps address many of the limitations. AI targeting could still help in the event that the relay is disrupted or the mothership is shot down.

British Defense Cuts Hit All Three Services Hard	The United Kingdom has announced sweeping cuts of its Armed Forces as it seeks to save money, despite the precarious security situation in Europe and elsewhere. The Royal Air Force, British Army, and Royal Navy will also lose frontline equipment, and it’s not necessarily clear how capabilities will be maintained once these assets are withdrawn. Moreover, with a new defense review expected next year, there is the possibility of worse to come for the British Armed Forces. Speaking in parliament today, U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey outlined the plan, which will affect all three branches of the British military. The assets to be withdrawn include the following: The Royal Navy’s two Albion class amphibious assault ships, HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark will be taken out of service at the end of the year, around a decade earlier than planned — although their withdrawal has been threatened now for several years. With their retirement, the ability of the U.K. Royal Marines to launch land assaults from the sea will be notably reduced. A new class of amphibious warfare vessels, up to six Multi-Role Support Ships (MRSS), is being planned, with these expected to carry out a wider variety of operations, as you can read about here. However, these are only due to enter service beginning in the early 2030s, leaving a significant capability gap in the meantime. Concept artwork of the new Multi-Role Support Ship (MRSS). BMT The Royal Air Force will lose its fleet of 17 Puma battlefield mobility helicopters, together with 14 of the oldest Chinook heavy-lift helicopters used by the same service. The United Kingdom had already ordered new Chinooks to modernize that force, some of which date back to the very first deliveries of these helicopters in the early 1980s. However, today’s decision leaves a question mark over plans to replace the Puma fleet, under the New Medium Helicopter (NMH) program. There had already been suggestions that the NMH might also face the ax. A U.K. Royal Air Force Chinook helicopter on the flight deck of the aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales.

Although these have only been in service for six years, they have suffered a spate of crashes and have been widely criticized. You can read more about them here.

The warship was already in need of an expensive overhaul and was due for retirement. Interestingly, this particular warship collided with a Russian Navy submarine in the North Atlantic Ocean in 2020, and both vessels were reportedly damaged in the incident, which you can read more about here. Earlier this year, the Type 23 fleet had been reduced by two, with the decision to withdraw HMS Argyll and Westminster, reportedly in order to free up personnel to staff its new class of frigates. This reduced the service’s fleet of Type 23s to nine. All this comes at a time when the Royal Navy’s major surface combatants are in high demand, including in the Red Sea.

Crown Copyright LA(Phot) Dave Jenkins Defense Secretary Healey said the cuts would result in savings of up to £500 million — equivalent to around $633 million — over the next five years. Healey also defended the assets being withdrawn on the basis that they are 'outdated,' although this is a claim that doesn’t stack up for all the equipment affected, most notably the Watchkeeper drones. Despite their problems, these drones do offer certain critical capabilities, including ground moving-target indicator (GMTI), a radar mode that allows discrimination between moving targets on the ground and static ones, allowing it to track the activity of the moving targets over time.

'War in Europe, growing Russian aggression, conflict in the Middle East, and technology changing the nature of warfare. As a result, defense needs increased resilience and readiness for the future.' While that is certainly true, the truth is that, with some exceptions (notably Watchkeeper, again), this equipment is very much part of the U.K. Armed Forces’ resilience and readiness. Ultimately, the cuts are the result of tight budgets — something that the British military is becoming increasingly familiar with. A Watchkeeper drone in flight over the United Kingdom during a test flight. Watchkeepers have reportedly struggled to operate in the British climate. British Army Although working under greater financial pressure, the U.K. Armed Forces are also being called upon to restructure and modernize to better face the resurgent Russian threat, illustrated by the war in Ukraine and by a spike in ‘hybrid warfare’ activities across Europe, widely seen as being Kremlin-inspired. As well as Russia, the U.K. Armed Forces are also increasingly expected to play a more active role in the Indo-Pacific theater, not to mention in the Middle East, and a host of other global missions. These are significant ambitions, and, at the same time, the United Kingdom is committed to some hugely expensive ‘big ticket’ defense programs, including the replacement of the Royal Navy’s Trident submarine-based nuclear deterrent with the new Dreadnought class of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines, and the Tempest future combat aircraft. An infographic for the future Dreadnought class SSBN. BAE Systems While cuts have continued to be made, the U.K. government has remained committed to increasing the defense budget to 2.5 percent of GDP, a pledge that the defense secretary repeated today. However, he didn’t announce when this would come into effect. As it stands, the U.K. Armed Forces — like many others around the world — are being asked to do a lot more, with less. Removing older and expensive-to-operate equipment makes sense, so long as it’s being replaced by equivalent capabilities that are cheaper, but which also meet the demands of the latest force posture. A good example of this would be the Army’s Watchkeeper drones, which are not likely to be badly missed by many. On the other hand, there’s no doubt that uncrewed air systems are of growing importance on the battlefield and British efforts in this direction have so far achieved very mixed results. If the money saved by withdrawing Watchkeeper doesn’t help drive the development and fielding of more reliable drones for the Army, then questions will likely be asked.

Russian aggression is seeing the U.K. Armed Forces re-posture to fight a potential conflict in Europe, adding yet more demands on its three branches. Crown Copyright Corporal Rebecca Brown, RLC There is also the possibility of more cuts to come. After all, the U.K. government is expected to release its latest defense review next spring, and that might see another raft of cuts to all three services. With funds for defense spending limited, there will be fears that more equipment might be axed, as an easy option for making short-term savings. Overall, however, today’s cuts reflect the very harsh decisions facing the U.K. government as it seeks to meet the goal of a British military that is increasing its 'resilience and readiness' to meet a wider range of threats, not just from Russia.

ICBM Reentry Vehicle Capability Still Unproven By North Korea U.S...	The U.S. military has not seen demonstrable evidence of North Korea successfully testing a re-entry vehicle capable of bringing a nuclear warhead back down to Earth through the atmosphere, according to America's top officer in the Pacific region. The North Koreans are actively working on this technology, which is essential for long-range ballistic missiles with exo-atmospheric flight profiles, especially intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) able to reach the United States. 'All will have been aware by now that North Korea tested its largest ballistic missile, having reached an apogee of over 7,000 kilometers [approximately 4,349.5 miles], portending a capability that will have the ability to range the entire continental United States,' U.S. Navy Adm. Samuel Paparo said in opening remarks at an open event at the Brookings Institution think tank yesterday. Paparo is head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) and was referring to North Korea's first test launch of the Hwasong-19 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), claimed to be its longest-ranged design to date, on October 31. North Korean authorities said the missile reached a peak height of 7,687.5 kilometers (approximately 4776.8 miles). The Hwasong-19 was fired from this massive transporter-erector-launcher (TEL). North Korean State Media 'Do we know much about the North Koreans' ability to bring a re-entry vehicle safely back through the atmosphere and whether they would themselves have any confidence that they could do that?' Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow and director of research in the Foreign Policy program at Brookings, subsequently asked Paparo. 'Because it's one thing to range North America. It's something else to be able to bring a warhead [down] and detonate it.' 'Not yet. We've not yet seen that capability, but we just see continued testing towards that,' the INDOPACOM commander said in response. Designing a re-entry vehicle that can survive the physical and thermal stresses of hurtling down to Earth through the atmosphere at hypersonic speeds is a complex proposition. That vehicle also has to be able to keep any payload inside, such as a nuclear warhead, safe and be reliably and accurately able to reach the desired detonation point, which only adds to the challenge. A view of Earth, as purportedly seen from a camera mounted on the Hwasong-19 launched on October 31. North Korean State Media There is no debate that North Korea has been actively pursuing re-entry vehicle technology, which is critical for fielding a real ICBM capability, for years. The regime in Pyongyang has claimed to have successfully developed this capability in the past and to have progressed to work on multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRV). Observers have suggested that the Hwasong-19 has the hallmarks of design intended for a MIRV payload. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un inspects a thermonuclear warhead design in 2017. A graphic showing what looks to be a re-entry vehicle design is seen in the background. North Korean State Media A MIRVed missile could strike multiple targets, potentially hundreds of miles apart, and/or lob several warheads at a single target area to increase the likelihood of achieving total destruction. Multiple incoming re-entry vehicles increase the challenges for defenders, especially if they are mixed in with decoys and other countermeasures. Paparo's comments yesterday underscore that there remains no definitive evidence available, at least publicly, to support North Korea's re-entry vehicle claims. At the same time, it is important to stress here that North Korea could still potentially at least attempt an IBCM strike against the United States, or a similarly ranged target area, without having a re-entry vehicle capability that the U.S. military has conclusively assessed to be functional. It could also seek to cause a massive global disruption by detonating nuclear warheads in space, something The War Zone has explored in the past. 'The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has assessed that North Korea’s Hwasong-14/KN20 intercontinental-range ballistic missile (ICBM) test launch on July 28[, 2017] failed to demonstrate successful atmospheric reentry,' The Diplomat reported back in 2017, citing anonymous U.S. government sources. 'The same assessment, however, notes that North Korea’s ICBM reentry vehicles would likely perform adequately if flown on a normal trajectory to continental U.S. targets.' The video below includes clips of the Hwasong-14 launch on July 28, 2017. 'The CIA assessment notes that based on the two observed flight tests of the Hwasong-14 to date, North Korea’s reentry vehicle technology is likely sufficiently advanced to pose no performance problem should the missile be fired at a minimum energy trajectory,' that story added. 'The assessment of the reentry vehicle is supported by analysis of data 'gathered from ground, sea, and air-based sensors' by the U.S. National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC).' In his remarks yesterday, Adm. Paparo also highlighted growing military cooperation between North Korea and Russia and the worrisome impacts that might have in the future. 'So North Korea has contributed [ballistic] missiles &#8230; directly used [by Russia] against Ukraine. They have contributed artillery shells that have been directly used against Ukraine. Now they have directly contributed soldiers &#8230; [and] they're being directly used against Ukraine,' Paparo noted. 'I would expect coming back will be submarine technology and propulsion technology.' News that North Korea had started construction of a new submarine, which could feature nuclear propulsion, had emerged in October. Last year, the North Koreans also formally unveiled a heavily reworked Cold War-era Romeo class diesel-electric submarine modified to fire ballistic missiles, seen below. North Korean State Media North Korea's new-ish missile submarine. KCNA The War Zone has pointed out in the past that re-entry vehicle technology, something Russia has significant experience with, could well be something else North Korean authorities might seek in return for their support in the ongoing fighting in Ukraine. The Russians also possess other missile technology that could feed into North Korean developments. 'At this point, it’s very early in &#8230; our assessment phase, and we don’t see any indication at this point that there was Russian involvement,' U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said at a press conference alongside Secretary of State Antony Blinken, as well as their respective South Korean counterparts, on October 31. 'But again, we’ll continue to work with our partners and our allies in the region to analyze this.' North Korea also has close ties to China and Iran, which also both have very active ballistic missile programs. Over the past decade or so, North Korea has conducted tests of a significant number of new liquid and solid-fuel ballistic missiles, including multiple ICBM designs, as well as hypersonic and long-range cruise missiles. This further includes types that North Korean officials say are capable of carrying nuclear warheads, something the country also looks to be stepping production of. The Hermit Kingdom has also demonstrated its ability to fire ballistic missiles from a wide array of static and mobile launchers, including ones emplaced at the bottom of lakes and rail-based systems. As underscored by the Hwasong-19 test, North Korea's missile and nuclear weapons programs continue to be very active. Though Adm. Paparo says the U.S. military has not seen evidence of a successful demonstration of re-entry vehicle capability, the North Koreans are clearly pushing ahead toward that goal.

Danish Navy Shadows Chinese Cargo Ship After Baltic Sea Cable Dam...	Denmark has confirmed it’s monitoring the Chinese cargo vessel at the center of allegations surrounding recent damage to two communication cables in the Baltic Sea. Yesterday, Germany said that the damage was most likely the result of sabotage, while the Chinese ship, the Yi Peng 3, was identified as having been operating in the vicinity of the cables when the incidents occurred. You can read our previous reporting on the incidents here. In a statement on X today, the Danish Armed Forces said: 'We are present in the area near the Chinese ship Yi Peng 3. The Danish Defense currently has no further comments.' Regarding the Chinese ship Yi Peng 3:The Danish Defence can confirm that we are present in the area near the Chinese ship Yi Peng 3.

The Yi Peng 3 is 224 meters (735 feet) long, with a beam of 32 meters (105 feet) and it has a gross tonnage of 40,622 tons. As for the damaged cables, you can read more about the background of those incidents in our previous report. In summary, the first of these is the 135-mile-long BSC cable between the Swedish island of Gotland and Lithuania, which was damaged around 8:00 a.m. GMT last Sunday. The second is C-Lion 1, a 746-mile-long cable between Helsinki and the German port of Rostock, put out of action around 2:00 a.m. GMT on Monday. Both of these are fiber-optic communication cables, running along the Baltic seabed.

Photo by Murat Usubali/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu Already yesterday there were suggestions that the Yi Peng 3 might somehow be involved in the incidents. Based on publicly available ship-tracking data, the Yi Peng 3 appears to have passed overhead both of the cables at around the same time as the incidents of damage were first reported. According to the German newspaper Kieler Nachrichten, on Monday, when the damage to the C-Lion 1 cable was confirmed, the Yi Peng 'stopped, drifted, and sailed two circles in the sea area south of Öland for almost 90 minutes.' The Chinese cargo vessel was seen to slow down as it passed the cables, based on data gathered by auonsson, an open-source intelligence analyst. 'The speed of cargo ship Yi Peng 3 was affected negatively as she passed the two Baltic Sea cable breaks C-Lion 1 and BSC,' auonsson wrote on the social media platform Bluesky. 'Before the incidents, she held normal speeds. After stopping and drifting for 70 minutes she again held normal speeds. By this time the two cables were broken.'

The changes in speed are much more significant than the changes in wind speed,' auonsson adds.

In October last year, the Balticconenctor gas pipeline running between Estonia and Finland was damaged. The Finnish National Bureau of Investigation later identified the culprit as the Chinese container ship Newnew Polar Bear, which had dropped its anchor, dragging it along the seabed. A joint press conference for the investigation into the damage to the Balticconnector gas line on October 8, 2023, between Finland and Estonia at the headquarters of the National Bureau of Investigation in Vantaa, Finland on October 24, 2023. The screen shows the Chinese cargo ship Newnew Polar Bear, which was the focus of their investigation. Photo by HEIKKI SAUKKOMAA/Lehtikuva/AFP via Getty Images HEIKKI SAUKKOMAA The Newnew Polar Bear had earlier been spotted with one of its anchors missing and the same type of paint on the anchor could be matched to that on the damaged pipeline. Chinese authorities later admitted that the Newnew Polar Bear was to blame but stated that it was an accident. However, the rapid departure of the Newnew Polar Bear from the Baltic last October fueled suspicions that the pipeline damage might have been an act of sabotage. With that in mind, it would make sense for the Danish authorities to investigate the Yi Peng 3 before it transits into international waters and continues its journey.

If the Yi Peng 3 is found to have been responsible for the damage, questions will very likely be asked about how that could have happened — especially since two cables in separate locations were affected. Moreover, with the precedent of the Newnew Polar Bear incident last year, there will likely be concerns that this could be evidence of some sort of broader, deliberate campaign in the highly strategic Baltic region. We will update this post if more information becomes available.

U.S. Embassy In Kyiv Temporarily Closed Due To Russian Airstrike ...	In a rare move, the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv shut down operations today after officials 'received information about a potential significant air attack on November 20,' the embassy announced. Several other Western embassies followed suit. Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials say the country is being subjected to a large-scale Russian propaganda campaign using 'fake' information about a potential attack to spread fear. 'Out of an abundance of caution, the Embassy will be closed, and Embassy employees are being instructed to shelter in place,' the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv posted on its website Wednesday. 'The U.S. Embassy recommends U.S. citizens be prepared to immediately shelter in the event an air alert is announced.' The announcement did not elaborate on the threat to Kyiv, which is frequently targeted by Russia and had just been hit by another volley of missiles and drones overnight.

The Embassy will continue to provide updates via official U.S. Embassy social media platforms. ' After the U.S. closed its embassy, Greece, Italy, and Spain followed suit.

'As a precaution, the Embassy in Kyiv will remain closed to the public today. The Embassy remains operational. In the event of an air raid alert, all Italian citizens present in the country are advised to follow the most stringent risk mitigation measures and immediately go to the nearest shelter.' The closures come amid heightened tensions. On Tuesday, Ukraine used U.S.-made Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles for the first time against a target inside Russia. In response to the Biden administration’s approval of such attacks, a top Russian politician said that his nation could launch a weapon never before used in retaliation. Adding to the concerns, a previously planned reduction in the threshold by which Russia said it would use its nuclear arsenal went into effect on Tuesday. The closure is not related to 'Russia’s announcement that it has lowered the threshold for a nuclear strike,' the embassy added. 'The embassy closure is related to ongoing threats of air attacks. ' Ukrainian officials suggested that the warnings are based on Russian propaganda efforts to sow fear. 'A terrorist country is conducting a massive information and psychological attack against Ukraine,' the Ukrainian Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR) stated on Telegram Wednesday. 'A message about the threat of a ‘particularly massive’ rocket-bomb attack on Ukrainian cities today is being spread through messengers and social networks, allegedly on behalf of the GUR. This message is a fake, it contains grammatical errors typical for Russian information and psychological operations.' GUR urged people to 'trust information only from official resources and from the spokespersons of the Ministry of Education and Culture. The enemy, unable to subjugate Ukrainians by force, resorts to measures of intimidation and psychological pressure on society. Please be vigilant and persistent.' Still, the threat of air strikes remains very real, GUR reminded. 'Do not ignore air raid signals - it is safer to wait in shelter,' GUR explained.

'In terms of information, now they are also trying to shake panicky moods against the background of the closing of embassies,' Andriy Kovalenko, head of Ukraine’s Center for Countering Disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council, said on Telegram Wednesday Ukraine has been well aware that Russia was planning future attacks and stockpiling munitions to hit the nation’s power and heating infrastructure ahead of winter, Kovalenko noted. 'The Russians prepared for shelling in the cold season - this is their tactic,' he posited. 'Rockets were stockpiled, aviation and fleet were being prepared. Bet on cruise missiles and ballistics, as well as drones for the depletion of air defense. These plans are not unexpected, they are known and warned about.' The Russians, he added, 'have different types of missiles in their arsenal. And this is also known.'

'After three years of large-scale, as well as now knowing about Russia's presence of missiles and plans to attack Ukraine and infrastructure, Ukrainians already understand the situation - you need to plan your time and prepare safe places for yourself in case of alarm, calculate the route and the time it takes to reach these safe places can be reached,' he offered. 'It is also important to follow official communications, in particular, from the Air Force.' 'As for the panic that they are trying to incite, I will clarify once again that Russia was preparing for shelling and this is part of the war,' Kovalenko said. 'The plans of the Russians are known to the Defense Forces. There is and will be an antidote.' Ukrainian offices are also closing and urging employees to work from home, another sign of how far the fake messaging has spread, argued Maria Drutska, a former Ukrainian defense official now working in the foreign affairs sector.

Conflicts 'Eating Into' Critical Munitions Stockpiles Needed For ...	The U.S. military risks going into a potential major fight with China with insufficient stocks of Patriot surface-to-air interceptors and other key munitions due to obligations in the Middle East and Ukraine, the top officer in the Pacific has warned. America's armed forces need to not only replenish that inventory, but grow it further, to be adequately prepared for a high-end scenario in the Pacific, especially a conflict over Taiwan. U.S. Navy Adm. Samuel Paparo, head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM), talked bluntly about his concerns at an open event the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, D.C., hosted earlier today. Adm. Samuel J. Paparo, commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, speaks at AFCEA’s TechNet Indo-Pacific in Honolulu, Oct. 24, 2024. USN At one point in the discussion Paparo was asked a direct question about whether ongoing fighting in Ukraine and in and around the Middle were impacting U.S. military preparedness in his part of the world. 'Up to this year, where most of the employment of weapons were really artillery pieces and short-range weapons, I had said not at all,' he said. 'But now, with some of the Patriots that have been employed, some of the air-to-air missiles that have been employed, it is now eating into [our] stocks. &#8230; and to say otherwise would be dishonest.' Ukraine has received a number of Patriot surface-to-air missile systems and interceptors to go with them from the U.S. military and other Western partners. Patriots were also among the air and missile defense systems employed in the defense of Israel against Iranian attacks in April. Ukrainian personnel remove camouflage netting from a Patriot launcher. Ukrainian Air Force Ukrainian personnel remove camouflage netting from a Patriot launcher, which is loaded with missile canisters associated with older interceptors like the PAC-2-series. Ukrainian Air Force The U.S. military has supplied a variety of other air and missile defense capabilities to Ukraine since 2022. American forces have also expended significant numbers of surface-to-air and air-to-air munitions in operations to shield friendly warships and commercial shipping in and around the Red Sea from Houthi militants in Yemen, as well as while defending Israel. This includes SM-2, SM-3, and SM-6 ship-launched surface-to-air interceptors and AIM-9X and AIM-120 air-to-air missiles. Ground-based National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS), examples of which have been supplied to Ukraine, can also fire AIM-9Xs and AIM-120s. The US Navy Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Carney fires an SM-2 missile at Houthi threats in October 2023. USN The U.S. Navy's Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Carney fires a missile at a Houthi threat in October 2023. Also visible in the foreground is a Phalanx CIWS. USN A variety of other surface and air-launched munitions have gone to Ukraine and/or have been expended in the course of operations against the Houthis and elsewhere in the Middle East, as well. One prime example of this is supplies of Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) short-range ballistic missiles to Ukrainian forces, which they have just recently gotten American approval to employ against targets inside Russian territory. In the past, Army officials have explicitly cited incoming stocks of new Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) short-range ballistic missiles as helping free up ATACMS for Ukraine. A US Army M270-series launcher fires an ATACMS missile. US Army 'If there are X [munitions in the] inventory of the United States of America, which is fungible across all theaters, that can be applied equally across any contingency, &#8230; none are reserved for any particular theater,' expending them elsewhere 'inherently, it imposes costs on the readiness of America to respond in the Indo-Pacific region,' Adm. Paparo explained. 'The Indo-Pacific region&#8230; is the most stressing theater for the quantity and quality of munitions, because the PRC [People's Republic of China] is the most capable potential adversary in the world,' he continued. 'We should replenish those [munition] stocks and then some. I was already dissatisfied with the magazine depth,' America's top officer in the Pacific, who took up the post in May, added. 'I'm a little more dissatisfied with the magazine depth. You know, it's a time for straight talk.' Paparo is not the first to raise the alarm about what the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East are doing to U.S. munition stockpiles. Navy officials have been especially open about the worrying number of missiles and other weapons that have been expended against Houthi and Iranian threats. Concerns about the adequacy of U.S. stocks of certain munitions also predate these current crises, as the The War Zone has highlighted in the past. An SM-3 missile at the moment of launch. The first combat employment of this anti-ballistic missile interceptor was in April 2024 against Iranian ballistic missiles headed toward Israel. USN An SM-3 anti-ballistic missile interceptor at the moment of launch. USN There have already been growing calls from inside America's armed forces, as well as Congress and elsewhere, to replenish those inventories and grow them beyond their previous size. There is also an emerging consensus that expanding and diversifying the U.S. industrial base available to produce key munitions, as well as developing and fielding lower-cost capabilities that are faster produce, is increasingly critical. The Patriot interceptors and other munitions Paparo alluded to today are not bought off the shelf, are full of high-end and often unique components, and can take months or even years to procure. As indicated by his 'magazine depth' remarks, Paparo is already very outspoken on these issues, especially when it comes to preparing for a potential conflict with China over Taiwan, in the South China Sea, or elsewhere in the Pacific. Paparo has previously discussed efforts to help the Taiwanese defend themselves through the use of hordes of kamikaze drones and other uncrewed platforms in the air, on the waves, and underwater that would turn the battlespace around the island into a 'hellscape' for invaders, as you can read more about here. Speaking today, Paparo stressed his belief that the U.S. military should be working to prepare for a potential fight around Taiwan as soon as possible rather than with an eye toward being ready to do so by 2027. U.S. officials regularly cite past statements by Xi Jinping telling the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to at least be prepared by that year to successfully execute an armed invention against the island. 'The closer we get to it [2027], the less relevant that date is, and the more we must be ready today, tomorrow, next month, next year, and onward,' Paparo said at Brookings. With a new presidential administration on the horizon and concerns about at best flat defense budgets in the coming years, there are many new questions facing the U.S. military when it comes to things like replenishing munitions and its general global posture. Regardless, when it comes to Ukraine, specifically, 'ATACMS may be the last major offensive weapons system left that the U.S. has to take off its shelf and hand to' that country, according to a separate report just today from Politico, which only underscores Paparo's remarks. The current head of INDOPACOM has certainly made clear that he believes that there is a worrisome shortfall of critical munitions, which would be doubly concerning should a high-end fight with China break out.

Army Arsenal Seeking Info On Mysterious Drone Flights Over Instal...	The U.S. Army's Picatinny Arsenal in northern New Jersey is working with local, state, and federal partners to obtain more information about mysterious drone activity over the facility and in the surrounding area, a spokesman told us. His comments were in response to questions we asked about reports of strange drone activity near the facility that emerged on social media overnight. The military installation is home to several important armament development organizations, including the Joint Center of Excellence for Guns and Ammunition, the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command (DEVCOM) Armaments Center, and one of the Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC)'s research and development laboratories. The reported drone activity comes in the wake of a drone incursion over Langley Air Force Base last December that we were the first to report. You can read more about that in our initial story about those incidents here. Langley is just a high-profile example of an increasingly concerning pattern of peculiar drone operations around sensitive facilities. 'We received reports of what were believed to be drones flying over Picatinny Arsenal, in addition to other locations in Morris County&#8230;on the evening of November 18, 2024,' facility spokesman Timothy Rider told us in an email Tuesday afternoon. 'Picatinny Arsenal organizations were not involved in UAV flight operations on that date. We are working with several of our local, state, and federal partner organizations to obtain more information on the reported activity.' One Twitter account claimed that drones flew over Picatinny Arsenal.

Several social media accounts posted video and images Tuesday of lights seen over northern New Jersey they attribute to drones of an unknown origin. However, they are low-quality and it is impossible to discern exactly what was seen and whether they were even drones. 'Unusual activity reported over Morris County, NJ: multiple large drones spotted flying from the Somerset County border northward and back,' the @NJerzyFireAlert Twitter account reported. 'Law enforcement has been advised to notify their communications centers of any sightings.' New Jersey State Police 'aviation is reported to be in the area tracking the drones,' the account, which monitors police and fire activities in the area, added. 'An Army Black Hawk helicopter was also tracked on flight radar in the area. Multiple reports of the drones being spotted in Madison, Morris Township, and Mendham.'

Boris Sanchez with the Dover Police Department, told us that as of Tuesday afternoon, his agency has not received any reports about drones flying in the area last night or early this morning. Meanwhile, about 25 miles to the north, drones are being used in efforts to fight a large forest fire along the New Jersey-New York border. It is unclear what, if any connection, there is between those and what was posted on social media, but that seems unlikely considering the distance involved, unless they were being confused with manned aircraft. Several drones were spotted near the Picatinny Arsenal in northern New Jersey. The facility is about 25 miles from a large forest fire on the New Jersey-New York border. (Google Earth image) 'New York State Police Drones continue to play a vital role in the ongoing battle against the Jennings Creek Wildfire, which has now consumed 5,300 acres along the New York-New Jersey border,' the Drone-XL website reported on Monday. 'The fire, which initially challenged responders with only 10% containment, has now reached 88% containment on the New York side and 90% containment on the New Jersey side, thanks in part to advanced drone surveillance capabilities.' New York State Police Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) pilots 'remain at the forefront of the firefighting operation, using thermal imaging to identify hotspots and guide ground crews, according to Patch. 'This aerial intelligence has proven especially valuable as the fire zone has expanded and conditions have evolved.' Drones operating on the New York side of the fire did not cross into New Jersey, a New York State Police spokesman told us. 'New York State Police is the only agency authorized to operate Unmanned Aerial Systems on the New York State side of the wildfire,' Beau Duffy said. 'We don’t have any evidence that our UAS have crossed into New Jersey.' Nobody has sought information about the New Jersey drone sightings from the New York State Police, Duffy added. The New York State Department of Military and Naval Affairs (DMNA) told us that they were flying UH-60 Black Hawk and CH-47 Chinook helicopters to help fight the fire, but they were not operating drones in that effort. Eli Roberts, who chases storms, captured extensive video of those helicopter flights in operation, which you can see below. We have reached out to several federal, state and local agencies for additional details and will update this story with any pertinent information provided. It remains unclear exactly what people were seeing in the sky last evening over and near Picatinny Arsenal, however, the installation is clearly taking reports of drone activity seriously enough to contact several other partner organizations to find answers. This fits with a major change in how seriously military installations and critical infrastructure facilities are taking these kinds of events. For years they were largely seen as puzzling and action came slow, if at all. Now, with the glaring threat posed by drones of various types and their proliferation in conflicts overseas, as well as the increase in intrusion events at home and abroad, and especially after the events over Langley AFB last winter, they are being looked at with much more concern. This now includes accelerating the deployment of military capabilities to identify and defeat drone systems near these key areas, which you can read about here. We will update you when we find out more details about this incident.

Sabotage Claims Swirl Around Severed Baltic Sea Cable Incidents	Germany says that damage to two communication cables in the Baltic Sea was most likely the result of sabotage. The mysterious incidents, which began on Sunday, are the latest in a series in the region. They come as concerns grow over nefarious Russian activity in Europe, seemingly part of an apparent wave of ‘hybrid warfare’ as the conflict in Ukraine further stokes East-West tensions. Meanwhile, accounts of a Chinese vessel operating in the vicinity of the cables around the time they were damaged raises the possibility that this might have been involved, whether deliberately or otherwise. The two cables in question are both fiber-optic communication cables, running along the Baltic seabed. One of these runs between the Swedish island of Gotland and Lithuania, and the other between Finland and Germany. An infographic shows the approximate locations of the undersea cables that were damaged in the Baltic Sea in the last few days. Photo by Murat Usubali/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu The first of these — some 135 miles long — appears to have been damaged at around 8:00 a.m. GMT on Sunday, according to the telecoms company Telia Lietuva. This led to an outage on internet communications. The second cable is 746 miles long, running between Helsinki and the German port of Rostock. This was put out of action around 2:00 a.m. GMT on Monday, the Finnish cybersecurity and telecoms company Cinia said. A fiber-optic cable is pulled ashore from a German cable-laying ship in the Baltic. The cable seen here, which runs from Scandinavia to the German island of Rügen, also appears at the top of this story.

Photo by Laszlo Pinter/picture alliance via Getty Images picture alliance 'No one believes that the cables were accidentally damaged,' Pistorius said. 'I also don’t want to believe that the ships’ anchors caused the damage by accident.' 'We have to assume, without certain information, that the damage is caused by sabotage,' he added.

Meanwhile, the foreign ministers of Finland and Germany have offered more circumspect statements on the incidents, with a joint statement expressing their 'deep concern' and confirmation that a 'thorough investigation' is now underway. The Swedish Navy, too, confirmed today that a criminal investigation is underway in that country, with the navy contributing ships that will pinpoint the locations of the damaged cables.

Full statement by @ElinaValtonen and @ABaerbock: pic.twitter.com/5oM46cFZdb&mdash; GermanForeignOffice (@GermanyDiplo) November 18, 2024 However, this is hardly the first time that there has been suspicious activity in the Baltic Sea, including suspected sabotage. Most notoriously, there was a series of explosions along the Nord Stream gas pipelines in 2022. The cause of these is still being investigated by German authorities. One of the 2022 Nord Stream gas leaks photographed from a Danish F-16 fighter. Danish Armed Forces Outside of the Baltic, there have been other incidents of reported sabotage of critical communications cables, including one associated with Evenes Air Station, in northern Norway, which happened in April, but was only disclosed in August, as TWZ reported at the time. Norway has seen other suspicious incidents in the past, notably the cutting of a vital undersea cable connecting Svalbard to mainland Norway in 2022. While the Baltic Sea has long been of strategic significance for both Russia and NATO and its allies, there has been a spike in incidents in these waters since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Against the backdrop of East-West tensions, suspected sabotage incidents in the Baltic have led to speculation that these may be Russian-inspired, or at least connected to this standoff. 'The fact that such an incident immediately raises suspicions of intentional damage speaks volumes about the volatility of our times,' said Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen and her German counterpart Annalena Baerbock in their joint statement. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock (right) and Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen (left). Photo by Kay Nietfeld/picture alliance via Getty Images picture alliance 'Our European security is not only under threat from Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine but also from hybrid warfare by malicious actors. Safeguarding our shared critical infrastructure is vital to our security and the resilience of our societies.' The foreign ministers stepped back from blaming Russia directly for the latest incidents, but, in a separate statement, Baerbock did draw attention to other reported Kremlin-inspired hostile activity in Europe in recent months. Baerbock noted that Germany has been targeted by cyber-attacks, surveillance of critical infrastructure, and fires as the result of an incendiary device plot, which you can read more about here. Other incidents in Germany this year alone have included an alert at Geilenkirchen Air Base after the German Ministry of Defense reported 'intelligence information indicating a potential threat,' the arrest of two German-Russian nationals on suspicion of plotting sabotage attacks on U.S. military facilities in the country, as well as reports of unexplained drone activity, including over a major floating liquid natural gas (LNG) terminal. 'These can’t all just be coincidences,' the German foreign minister said. E-3A AWACS aircraft at Geilenkirchen in February 2022. In August this year, the facility’s state of alert was raised in response to 'intelligence information indicating a potential threat.' Photo by Marius Becker/picture alliance via Getty Images In the meantime, NATO is stepping up its surveillance activities in the Baltic. In particular, the Latvian Navy has said it will increase its patrols in the areas where the cables were damaged. More broadly, NATO’s Allied Maritime Command (MARCOM) says that it is aware of an increased threat to undersea infrastructure. 'These attacks show how vulnerable such infrastructure can be. NATO is stepping up patrols near undersea infrastructure,' the command said. In the recent past, MARCOM has also highlighted the specific risk that Russia poses to undersea infrastructure. 'We know the Russians have developed a lot of hybrid warfare under the sea to disrupt the European economy through cables, internet cables, pipelines. All of our economy under the sea is under threat,' MARCOM’s deputy commander Vice-Admiral Didier Maleterre said earlier this year. Previously, we’ve looked at how the Russian Navy has a variety of means at its disposal to conduct covert operations on the seabed. It’s widely assumed that Russia’s special mission submarines, deep-sea submersibles, and unmanned underwater vehicles can be used for both investigating and disrupting undersea cables. Certainly, cutting communications cables should be well within the capabilities of such craft. There are also various Russian Navy surface vessels that are ideal for these kinds of activities. Prominent among them is the Yantar, described as an 'oceanographic research vessel,' but frequently used for military purposes, with specialized equipment that can reportedly tap or cut submarine cables and investigate and retrieve objects from depths of up to 18,000 feet. Recently, the Yantar was escorted out of the Irish Sea after it entered Irish-controlled waters and patrolled an area containing critical energy and internet submarine pipelines and cables. The Russian spy ship Yantar. Almaz Design Bureau On the other hand, sabotage of undersea cables could likely also be achieved covertly even without using methods as high-tech as submarines and other underwater vehicles. In shallower water, divers would be able to operate, although they would still require some kind of support vessel, at least in the general vicinity. The security situation in the Baltic is also having a direct effect on infrastructure plans. Most prominently, Sweden decided earlier this month not to build 13 new offshore windfarms, citing the security risks involved. As for the most recent damage to the Baltic communication cables, there has been some speculation that a commercial vessel may have been responsible, by dragging its anchor along the seabed. There would also appear to be a precedent for this. Last year, a subsea gas pipeline and several telecoms cables off the coasts of Finland and Estonia were badly damaged in an incident that was initially suspected of being sabotage. Ultimately, investigators determined that a Chinese container ship likely dragged its anchor had caused the damage. While it’s unclear whether the damage in 2023 was accidental or intentional, it’s possible that the same thing might have happened again in the last few days. Based on publicly available ship-tracking websites, it appears that another Chinese vessel, the Yi Peng 3, may have been in close proximity to both the communication cables around the time that damage was reported. Using the same data, it seems that the cargo ship also slowed down while passing over the cables. pic.twitter.com/KU0zU0Rtu5&mdash; auonsson (@auonsson) November 19, 2024 Strong circumstantial evidence that Chinese-flagged cargo ship Yi Peng was responsible for breaking two underwater telecoms cables in the Baltic Sea (17-18th November).CLion1 connecting Finland and Germany and BSC connecting Sweden and Lithuania severed.Via… pic.twitter.com/3Bknm21RVo&mdash; Navy Lookout (@NavyLookout) November 19, 2024 The same Chinese vessel was later noted being shadowed by the Royal Danish Navy, before heading out of the Baltic. So far, previous incidents involving appare t sabotage to Baltic Sea infrastructure have proven very difficult to pin on any one culprit, despite a spike in reports of Russian-inspired activity in this regard. However, the latest developments underscore the fact that undersea infrastructure is a major vulnerability, something that has been known for years, while the Baltic Sea’s strategic importance is magnified by the standoff between NATO and Russia.

TB3 Drone Lands, Takes Off From Turkey’s ‘Drone Carrier’ Amphibio...	A Bayraktar TB3 uncrewed aircraft has successfully landed on and taken off from the Turkish Navy’s ‘drone carrier’ TCG Anadolu for the first time. TB3s, which can be armed with small precision munitions and conduct surveillance and reconnaissance missions, are set to be a central component of the ship's air wing. Selcuk Bayraktar, Chief Technology Officer at the TB3's manufacturer Baykar, posted videos of the TB3's milestone achievements aboard Anadolu on social media earlier today. Bayraktar had previously posted clips showing one of the drones making approaches and flying over the ship's flight deck, but not actually touching down. Sevda kuşun kanadında..

The TB3 flew for the first time last year and conducted its first land-based ski-jump takeoff test earlier this year. The drone is a navalized variant of the combat-proven TB2, which Ukrainian forces extensively employed in the opening phases of Russia's all-out invasion. TB2s have also seen combat in Syria and Libya, as well as in fighting between Azerbaijan and Armenia. The Anadolu's design is based on that of Spain’s Juan Carlos I amphibious assault ship and it features a large open flight deck with a ski-jump at the bow. The Turkish vessel also has a well-deck at the rear for launching and recovering landing craft, as well as spaces internally for accommodating tanks and other vehicles and ground personnel, to support traditional amphibious operations. The TCG Anadolu. Ozan Guzelce/via Getty Images In 2023, Turkish authorities announced plans to optimize the ship's configuration to support drone operations. Modifications to support that shift in focus would include the addition of dedicated control stations and accompanying beyond-line-of-sight satellite communications terminals, a ‘roller system’ on the flight deck toward the bow to help launch uncrewed aircraft, an arresting gear system, and safety nets. Selcuk Bayraktar's videos do not appear to show the use of any launch or recovery systems on Anadolu as part of the latest TB3 testing, indicating those modifications, at least, are still to come. The TB3 landing on and taking off from Anadolu is still a significant achievement that puts Turkey one step closer to fielding an operational uncrewed naval aviation capability currently found in no other country. With an expected 1,000-mile-maximum range and 24-hour endurance, the drones are set to give the Turkish Navy a completely new way to project maritime power. The TB3s can be fitted with up to six underwing hardpoints capable of carrying small precision-guided missiles and bombs, as well as rockets and other munitions, along with a sensor turret containing electro-optical and infrared cameras underneath the central fuselage. A rendering of TB3 armed with various small precision-guided munitions. Baykar Flying from Anadolu's deck, TB3s could conduct attacks at certain targets on land and at sea, as well as conduct surveillance and reconnaissance missions. The drones could also act as aerial network relay nodes and, if fitted with a radar of some kind, possibly even serve as airborne early warning platforms. Turkey's naval drone ambitions for Anadolu already look to go beyond the TB3. An example of Baykar’s jet-powered fighter-like Kizilelma drone was also loaded onto the ship's flight deck for a ceremony marking its formal entry into service last year, as seen below. Kizilelma reflects a larger trend in increasingly advanced uncrewed aviation developments from the Turkish aviation sector that also includes Turkish Aircraft Industries (TAI) stealthy flying-wing ANKA-3 uncrewed combat air vehicle (UCAV). Serhat Cagdas/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images For Turkey, drones also just offer a valuable domestic pathway to fielding fixed-wing naval aviation capabilities, in general. The Turkish government's ejection from the F-35 program over the country's purchase of Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile systems in 2019 upended any near-term plans to acquire short-takeoff and vertical landing capable B variants for Anadolu. The S-400 deal and other factors led to a broader cooling of U.S.-Turkish relations that ended any discussion about acquisitions of ex-U.S. Marine Corps Harrier jump jets. There has been some talk in the past year about Turkey rejoining the F-35 program. Helicopters, including armed AH-1W Cobra and T129 types and anti-submarine warfare SH-60B Seahawks, are also expected to operate from Anadolu's deck.

China is making particularly significant strides in this regard, including in the development of flying wing UCAVs that can operate from carriers and other big-deck ships, as well as an entirely new class of super-sized amphibious assault ship. In the United Kingdom, the Royal Navy has shown its ability to launch and recover drones in the same general size class as the TB3, such as General Dynamics Mojave, from its carrier HMS Prince of Wales as part of efforts there to expand uncrewed naval aviation capabilities. Just last week, what General Atomics described as a Gray Eagle STOL drone successfully launched from South Korea's Dokdo amphibious assault ship as part of another demonstration, but recovered at a base on land.

General Atomics A number of other countries are also actively looking to field fixed-wing naval drone capabilities or otherwise exploring doing so, and in many cases by leveraging existing or future big-deck amphibious assault ships. In many ways, the U.S. Navy has been lagging behind in such developments, with the MQ-25 Stingray tanker drone set to be its first operational advanced uncrewed carrier-based aircraft. The MQ-25 will have a secondary surveillance and reconnaissance capability, and there have been discussions about adding additional roles and missiles, including stand-off strike, in the future. The Navy is now in the process of installing new dedicated drone control centers on its carriers, which it says will help it realize its own larger uncrewed naval aviation plans. The service has a stated goal for its carrier air wings to eventually become at least 60 percent pilotless. With the successful demonstration of the TB3's ability to land on and take off from the Anadolu, Turkey still looks in line to be the first to have an operational 'drone carrier.'

U.S.-Supplied ATACMS Missile Strike Inside Russia Have Begun	Ukraine has used the U.S.-made Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) for the first time against a target inside Russia, according to U.S. officials, as well as military sources in Russia and Ukraine. The confirmation comes soon after Moscow warned that the use of Western-supplied long-range missiles by Ukraine against Russia could trigger a nuclear response after Russian nuclear war plans were updated. Early this morning, a large explosion tore through Russia’s 67th GRAU Arsenal, a critical ammunition storage facility in Bryansk Oblast, sending a fireball soaring hundreds of feet in the air.Ukrainian attack drones had been spotted in the area. pic.twitter.com/YhNWDIsqJe&mdash; OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) November 19, 2024 This is allegedly the moment when ATACMS struck the 67th GRAU arsenal near Karachev.

The target is around 70 miles from the Ukrainian border. The ATACMS short-range ballistic missiles can hit targets up to about 190 miles away, while earlier variants feature a shorter range. Videos showed a large fireball rising over the area, as well as the sounds of multiple smaller explosions, with the specific target said to be the 67th Arsenal of the Russian Main Missile and Artillery Directorate (GRAU). The approximate location of Karachev within the Bryansk region of western Russia. Google Earth 'Indeed, this is the first time that ATACMS has been used to strike Russian territory. The strike was carried out on a facility in the Bryansk region, and it was successfully destroyed,' an unnamed Ukrainian military source told Ukrainian news agency RBC-Ukraine. Another Ukrainian official confirmed the use of ATACMS, speaking to the Washington Post on the condition of anonymity. Provided the Karachev depot was the target, this would suggest that indications that Washington had limited the use of ATACMS to Russia’s Kursk region exclusively are erroneous — or otherwise that Ukraine decided to ignore that restriction. On the other hand, the Bryansk region does neighbor it and it’s almost certain that weapons stored in Karachev were being used to directly support the Russian counteroffensive in Kursk. Too good to be true. As always, yesterday’s news that Biden allows Ukraine to use US long-range missiles to hit targets deep in Russia turns out to be too good to be true.

Local authorities also reported a drone attack, according to Astra Press, an independent Russian news outlet on Telegram. A combined operation using ATACMS and one-way attack drones is certainly a possibility. The attack was confirmed by Andriy Kovalenko, the head of Ukraine’s Center for Countering Disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council. In a post on Telegram, Kovalenko said that the facility was used to store artillery ammunition, anti-aircraft missiles, air-to-ground guided weapons, and ammunition for multiple-launch rocket systems. He also said that drones were involved in the attack, apparently arriving ahead of ATACMS. Meanwhile, the Russian Ministry of Defense also claimed that it had found debris from ATACMS missiles close to a military facility in the Bryansk region, further claiming that, from a total of six such missiles fired by Ukraine, five were brought down by Russian air defenses, and the other was damaged. The Russian Ministry of Defense said that a small fire had resulted from the attack but there were no casualties or significant damage. A U.S. Army HIMARS launcher fires an ATACMS missile.

So far, no videos or photos have emerged showing ATACMS fragments in Bryansk, either on social media or from official Russian channels. This is not the first time that this munitions storage facility has come under attack, with at least three such raids having been reported since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine was launched in February 2022. In the past, there were also Ukrainian reports that the depot was being used to store arms delivered to Russia by North Korea.

Today, however, Moscow has said that the use of missiles like ATACMS against Russia could lead to a nuclear response, as part of a newly unveiled nuclear doctrine. Speaking at his regular daily press briefing, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Ukraine’s use of Western-supplied conventional missiles against Russia could be met by Russian use of nuclear weapons — although the kinds of targets were not specified. Peskov said that the Kremlin considers the use of nuclear weapons to be an extreme measure, but that updating the doctrine was a necessary response to the current political situation. The latest nuclear doctrine, which was formally approved by Russian President Vladimir Putin before the U.S. election earlier this month, features an expanded list of criteria that could warrant a nuclear response. They now include 'aggression by any non-nuclear state, but with the participation or support of a nuclear country,' which would appear to be a very direct reference to Ukraine and its Western backers. Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin in Moscow on November 18, 2024. Photo by Vyacheslav PROKOFYEV / POOL / AFP VYACHESLAV PROKOFYEV 'In addition, a nuclear response from Russia is possible in the event of a critical threat to its sovereignty, even with conventional weapons, in the event of an attack on Belarus as a member of the Union State, [or] in the event of a massive launch of military aircraft, cruise missiles, drones, other aircraft and their crossing the Russian border,' the document adds. The updated Russian doctrine document is an astounding read. It is so broad and detailed that one has to wonder what it means. Why not just publish a one-pager declaring: 'The President can authorize the use of nuclear weapons in any scenario deemed necessary.' &mdash; Hans Kristensen (also on Bluesky) (@nukestrat) November 19, 2024 This is not the first time that Russia has issued nuclear threats within the context of the war in Ukraine. It has also undertaken tactical nuclear drills on its own territory and in Belarus. Earlier this year, leaked documents also appeared to indicate that Russia’s threshold for employing tactical nuclear weapons is significantly lower than previously thought. Ammunition storage sites were among the likely ATACMS targets that we identified within Russian borders. This is especially true in the case of the versions of ATACMS with cluster warheads, which deliver hundreds of bomblets over a wide area, although the unitary warhead version would also be ideal for penetrating hardened bunkers in which weapons might be stored. Other likely targets include airfields, logistics nodes, supply lines, equipment storage sites, and large gatherings of troops. Any of these — and more — may well be the next to be hit, while the attack on Karachev suggests that the next Ukrainian ATACMS strikes may well target areas outside of the critical Kursk region.

Already, the presence of these weapons in Ukraine has pushed back Russian airpower and at the same time put many more Russian air defense sites at risk. This same pattern will now be extended into Russia itself. With much uncertainty ahead of Trump’s new presidency and the possibility that U.S. arms deliveries to Ukraine will be significantly reduced, or perhaps cut altogether, Kyiv is very likely to try and make the best use of its limited ATACMS stocks in the next two months.

Extra Collaborative Combat Aircraft Purchases To Give USAF Test U...	A unit charged with exploring how the U.S. Air Force will utilize its future Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) is now set to get actual examples of the drones to experiment with. This comes as the service's CCA plans continue to evolve, now in part in response to serious concerns about budgetary shortfalls on the horizon. Andrew Hunter, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology & Logistics, announced the additional Increment 1 CCA purchases at Defense One’s State of Defense Business event on November 13. The CCA program is currently expected to include at least two iterative development cycles, or increments. Anduril and General Atomics are presently developing separate designs as part of the first increment, both of which are expected to fly for the first time next year. The Air Force expects to kick off a competition for Increment 2 sometime in Fiscal Year 2025, which began on Oct. 1. The CCA program also encompasses a variety of other related work, including on autonomous technologies. A model of Anduril's Increment 1 CCA design, called Fury. Jamie Hunter 'One thing that I recently did was approve some additional CCA purchases to equip the Experimental Operations Unit [EOU] in order to enable that experimentation to happen using real assets,' Hunter said last week, according to Defense One. The Air Force first announced plans for the EOU last year and is now in the process of establishing it at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. The unit is tasked with crafting new tactics, techniques, and procedures for employing CCAs, as well as exploring how those drones will be incorporated into the Air Force's overall force structure and helping to build trust in the autonomy algorithms that will underpin their operations. A model of the design General Atomics’ is working on for Increment 1 of the CCA program. Jamie Hunter Various organizations within the Air Force have already been using a variety of crewed and uncrewed aircraft to help lay the groundwork for the introduction of CCAs, as well as support other advanced drone and autonomy research and development and test and evaluation efforts. This includes the General Atomics XQ-67A Off-Board Sensing Station (OBSS) drone, from which that company's CCA design is derived. In his remarks last week, Assistant Secretary Hunter did not say how many additional CCAs, or what types specifically, the Air Force now plans to purchase for the EOU. Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall and Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin have said in the past that the service intends to acquire between 100 and 150 Increment 1 types, at least. It remains unclear whether or not Anduril and General Atomics designs might both ultimately enter production. 'The additional buy for the Air Force helps ensure that warfighters will have ample opportunity for experimentation to support operational fielding before the end of the decade,' Diem Salmon, Vice President of Air Dominance and Strike at Anduril, did say in a statement in response to Hunter's remarks, per Aviation Week. 'Supplying them with actual CCAs is an important step to that,' C. Mark Brinkley, a General Atomics spokesperson, also told Defense One, referring to the EOU's expected work. 'We’re happy to support them in any way.' Air Force Col. Timothy Helfrich separately disclosed that both Increment 1 CCA designs had passed their critical design review during a panel discussion at the inaugural Airpower Futures Forum hosted by the Air & Space Forces Association's Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies on November 13. Helfrich is currently the Senior Materiel Leader for the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center's Advanced Aircraft Division. Much about how the Air Force plans to field and operate its initial CCAs, and what capabilities mix the drones will need as a result, remains murky. The service has said in the past that it expects Increment 1 types to primarily be 'missile trucks' flying in close coordination with crewed combat jets, at least initially. Electronic warfare and Intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions have also been put forward as possible tasks for the initial tranche of the drones. The video below from Collins Aerospace presents one notional vision for how CCAs might operate together with crewed aircraft, at least initially. 'I think it’s a little too early to say whether or not we’re going to do Increment 1B or 1C. We’ll have to learn as Increment 1 rolls out and as Increment 2 rolls out, but we do expect them to be complementary,' Helfrich said last week, according to Air & Space Forces Magazine. 'I do expect that there will be a time where we have a mixture of Increment 1s and Increment 2s; [and] maybe Increment 3 out there.' In addition, 'no one should think that Increment 2 means ‘Increment 1 plus.’ … That doesn’t mean that Increment 2 has more capability,' he added, per DefenseScoop. 'We’re still looking to figure out whether the right balance — if you’re doing the analysis — is to further bring down the capability to maximize a low cost, or is it that I need to change what the focus is from a missile truck to something else.' 'If we are to continue to add capability and gold plate things, we're going to miss out on our costs and most importantly our schedule targets. And so making some of those tough trades,' he further noted, Defense One reported. 'To say this is good enough and moving on has been a challenge, because we want a lot, but we are making those decisions.' In addition, at least week's panel discussion last week, Col. Helfrich highlighted how CCAs are expected to be transformational and that the questions that need to be answered go well beyond just what the drones will do in a combat context. How and where they will operate from, especially on a day-to-day basis domestically within the United States, where there are significant restrictions on fully uncrewed flight activity, are still major unknowns. Other questions about basing and forward deployment, for combat and non-combat missions, as well as what units they will be assigned to persist. Ensuring artificial intelligence-driven autonomous capabilities work as intended and, perhaps more importantly, that operators trust it, are still major hurdles to be overcome. New CCA tactics, techniques, and procedures will also have to account for equally new training, maintenance, and logistics requirements that will be fundamentally different from those required to support crewed aircraft operations. CCAs may have very short service lives overall compared to traditional crewed aircraft. All of this is exactly why the Air Force is standing up the EOU and is somewhat curious that the original plan for this central experimentation force does not appear to have included assigning it actual CCAs. Much can be done using surrogates and high-fidelity simulations, but the new drones are expected to lead to so many changes that it is hard to see how having at least a handful of real examples would not just be valuable, but essential. Fears about at best flat defense budgets in the coming years and the growing costs of various priority modernization efforts have also emerged as another key factor in the Air Force's still-evolving CCA plans, especially when it comes to Increment 2. Secretary Kendall and others have said that Increment 2's requirements will be directly intertwined with other decisions about how to move forward with the acquisition (or not) of a new sixth-generation crewed stealth combat jet and a Next Generation Air-refueling System (NGAS) family of capabilities that could include a new stealth tanker. The sixth-generation fighter effort, which is currently undergoing a deep review, and the CCA program are both part of the larger Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative. A notional sixth-generation stealth combat jet. Collins Aerospace 'The variable that concerns me most as we go through this analysis and produce a range of alternatives is going to be [the availability of adequate resources.] … to pursue any combination of those new designs,' Kendall said, referring to the NGAD combat jet, CCA drones, and NGAS, in a keynote address at the Airlift/Tanker Association’s (ATA) annual symposium, on November 1. Kendall and other service officials have repeateldy stressed that the Air Force is committed to acquiring a mixture of future capabilities to ensure it will able to dominate in the air combat arena going forward. The service has also repeatedly pushed back on assertions that the CCA program's Increment 1 will produce an experimental rather than operational force. The stated goal is still for the first operational CCAs to begin entering service before the end of the decade. The work of the EOU, together now with an assigned force of CCAs, only looks set to be more critical as the Air Force continues to refine its plans for the drones as part of a larger and still-evolving future air power ecosystem.

Biden ATACMS Decision Spurs Russian Threats, Hope and Derision El...	President-elect Donald Trump’s National Security Advisor nominee criticized the Biden administration for easing restrictions on Ukraine’s use of U.S.-donated Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) short-range ballistic missiles. In a major policy shift, the Biden administration on Sunday said Ukraine is now allowed to use ATACMS, although limited to strikes inside Russia’s Kursk region. That move comes two months before Trump takes office. TWZ readers can get up to speed with the news about Biden's long-range weapons policy shift in our recent report here. Mike Waltz, currently a Florida congressman, also told Fox News that he was not briefed before the policy change became public. 'It's another step up the escalation ladder,' he said about allowing Ukraine to strike targets in Kursk with ATACMS. 'And nobody knows where this is going.' 'North Korea is unleashing ballistic missiles, artillery, now tens of thousands of soldiers' into Ukraine, he continued. 'The administration responds by lifting this restriction. North Korea sends more soldiers. South Korea is now saying it may get engaged. China is buying oil from Iran for pennies on the dollar.

The Biden administration move 'is a tactical development,' Waltz posited. 'President Trump is talking grand strategy here. How do we get both sides to the table to end this war? What's the framework for a deal and who's sitting at that table? Those are the things that President Trump, of course, will be working with.'

Howard Altman (@haltman) November 8, 2024 Russian President Vladimir Putin has yet to respond, but the Kremlin's spokesman said the move 'adds fuel to the fire.' 'This is a qualitatively new round of tension and a qualitatively new situation in terms of U.S. involvement in this conflict,' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists in a Monday briefing. 'It’s clear that the outgoing administration in Washington intends to take steps to, they’ve said so, to continue to add fuel to the fire and to further provoke the level of tension.' Putin has previously threatened to 'supply weapons of the same type to some regions of the world where they can be used to launch strikes on sensitive facilities of the countries that do it to Russia?' Russian State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin issued an ominous warning. 'On Biden's decision to allow Ukraine to strike deep into our country with U.S. missiles,' he wrote on Telegram. 'If this happens, Russia will be forced to respond. How is a question for the Ministry of Defense. It is possible that new weapons systems will be used, which the Russian Federation has not used on Ukrainian territory.' He did not specify what kind of weapon, though Russia's nuclear arsenal is obviously the most concerning. Regardless, Volodin said that while the ATACMS will 'cause damage&#8230;it will not change the situation on the battlefield. I emphasize this. But it will only worsen the fate of Ukraine and its future. And it will finally destroy Russian-American relations.'

He has repeatedly urged member states, in particular Germany, a leading military donor, to lift these restrictions. However, his attempts to craft an EU-wide position have gone unheaded, leaving each country to act unilaterally. 'You know my position,' Borrell told reporters on Monday. 'Ukraine should be able to use the arms we provide to them not only to stop the arrows but also to hit the archers. I continue believing this has to be done.' EU’s Josep Borrell: 'Ukraine should be allowed to strike inside Russia with EU-supplied arms. It’s not just about stopping the arrows but hitting the archers.' He expressed hope that EU members will support this during upcoming discussions. NOELREPORTS (@NOELreports) November 18, 2024 A since-revised story in the French Le Figaro media outlet on Sunday claimed that both France and Britain signed off on the use of their long-range weapons in Russia. That claim no longer appears. On Monday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot neither confirmed nor denied whether Ukraine had been granted permission to use SCALP-EG air-launched cruise missiles for strikes deep into Russian territory. Speaking to journalists ahead of a European Union ministers meeting in Brussels on Monday, Barrot referenced France’s previous stance on relaxing restrictions, according to Reuters. 'We openly said this was an option that we would consider if it was to allow to strike a target from where Russia is currently aggressing Ukrainian territory. So nothing new on the other side,' Barrot said. The U.K. has yet to allow Ukraine to use its similar Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missiles inside Russia, the BBC reported. Meanwhile, a former high-ranking Ukrainian official criticized the Biden administration for limiting the use of ATACMS to Russia's Kursk region. 'I think the weakness of the Biden administration in facing up to Putin is the key reason why we are entering the third year of war,' tweeted Tymofiy Mylovanov, Ukraine's former Minister of Economics. 'Ukrainians could have stopped Putin in 2022 had Biden not hesitated to provide weapons and allow strikes he is only now authorizing.' Too good to be true.

Life be damned!!! Imbeciles!' The Military Industrial Complex seems to want to make sure they get World War 3 going before my father has a chance to create peace and save lives. Gotta lock in those $Trillions. Life be damned!!! Imbeciles! Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) November 17, 2024 Allowing Ukraine to use ATACMS in Kursk is the latest in a series of iterative steps the Biden administration has taken when it comes to the use of long-range weapons on Russian soil. Back in May, Biden allowed Ukraine to use M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, with a range of about 50 miles, against targets inside Russia bordering Kharkiv Oblast. It was in response to a Russian counteroffensive in that area. Ukraine has also been using U.S.-donated Joint Direct Attack Munition-Extended Range (JDAM-ER) and Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) precision-guided bombs, as well as French-donated AASM-250 Hammer rocket-assisted bombs in Kursk. As we noted yesterday, Biden's ATACMS decision was a response to the presence of North Korean troops in Kursk to help Russia push Ukraine out of its three-month-old salient there. Holding on to Kursk is also critical, especially now, as it is seen as a key bargaining chip. With the new administration taking its own approach to the war, an attempt to negotiate a deal is now rapidly approaching on the horizon. Losing Kursk now would mean Ukraine's haggling position would be significantly weaker. One fear is that Putin will lash out regardless. The policy shift 'runs the risk of triggering a sharp increase in retaliatory sabotage, such as cyber and arson attacks on Britain and its European NATO partners,' The Guardian argued. The Latest On the battlefield, Russian troops are continuing to advance near two key cities in eastern Ukraine, but are making little progress in taking back territory in its Kursk region. In particular, Russian troops are pressing toward Kupiansk, a logistics hub along the Oskil River in Kharkiv Oblast as well as Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast. However, as the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) argues, Ukraine’s continued defense of Pokrovsk bodes well for the future. 'Russian forces have not taken Pokrovsk after eight months of grinding but consistent advances in western Donetsk Oblast. Ukrainian defensive operations, based on the integration of successful Ukrainian drone innovators and operators with ground forces combined with constraints on Russia's strategic and operational-level manpower and materiel reserves have forced the Russian military command to abandon its original campaign design of a frontal assault on Pokrovsk,' ISW suggested. 'Ukraine’s ability to stave off the seizure of Pokrovsk thus far and force the Russian military to divert its efforts to advances in arguably the least operationally significant sector of the frontline is a positive indicator of Ukraine’s ability to continue fighting this war despite the challenges Ukraine faces and the setbacks it has suffered.'

The commanders 'lied about the success of the assaults on Malaya Lokhnya and the frontline changes, which led to catastrophic results for the next stage of their planned operation,' the news outlet claimed. 'This false narrative led to a complete lack of situational awareness on the battlefield. In reality, the Russians did not control these settlements.' Instead, '100 Russian soldiers from the broken units were actually encircled with no chance to break out,' Euromaidan Press continued. 'In an attempt to secretly salvage the situation and align with the reports submitted to higher command, Russian commanders ordered repeated waves of assaults.' The War Zone cannot independently verify these claims.

'This is the first recorded case of such a symbiosis of a modern cruise missile of the Russian Federation and an outdated Soviet engine,' Colonel of the General Staff claimed. 'Given that the Russian Federation does not manufacture them, there is a possibility that they are taken from old Soviet stocks or the remnants of Kh-55, Kh-55SM cruise missiles are disassembled.' The production of subsonic rocket engines in the Russian Federation 'can be a kind of bottleneck (weak spot) in the entire chain of rocket production, and be a restraining factor in the continued increase in production volumes,' the Telegram channel postulated. 'Previously, the R-95-300 engines, in addition to its native Kh-55(SM) cruise missile, were also seen in almost all discovered Kh-59 guided air missiles.' Some Russian Kh-101 cruise missiles in recent strikes used old Soviet R-95-300 engines instead of standard Russian TRDD-50A engines.These engines are no longer manufactured, and must have been old Soviet stocks or scavenged from disassembled Kh-55/55SM cruise missiles. pic.twitter.com/aKWFfZJwlB&mdash; Roy (@GrandpaRoy2) November 18, 2024 The U.K. Defense Intelligence directorate said two Russian Gepard-class frigates, Tatarstan and Dagestan, were damaged in a Ukrainian drone attack on the port of Kaspiysk on November 6.

The plant at Russia’s Alabuga Special Economic Zone 'recently started churning out thermobaric drones alongside the decoys,' the investigation found. Also known as a fuel-air explosive (FAE) weapon, it is in the same class as certain U.S. weapons, like the AGM-114N Hellfire missile, with a special ‘augmented’ warhead, or the BLU-118/B that was used against cave complexes in Afghanistan. Essentially, this type of weapon works in two stages, using a fuel mixture scattered as as an aerosol cloud and an ignition detonation a to ignite the cloud. It generates a high-temperature explosion that generates a much more powerful blast wave over a longer duration than a conventional condensed explosive. It can kill people in gruesome ways even if they are located inside buildings, caves, and bunkers. 'Russia came up with the plan for decoys in late 2022 and codenamed it Operation False Target,' a person familiar with Russia’s drone production told AP. 'The idea was to launch armed drones along with dozens of decoys, sometimes stuffed with rags or foam, and indistinguishable on radar from those carrying real bombs,' the wire service stated. 'Ukrainian forces must make split-second decisions about how to expend scarce resources to save lives and preserve critical infrastructure.' Last week, we noted that Russia is using its Gerbera drones as decoys in Shahed-136 attack waves to fool Ukrainian air defense and force it to expend interceptors.

Research on Gerbera drones that have been shot down 'proved that the Russians make them according to the Chinese prototype using foreign components imported from China,' GUR claimed on its Telegram channel. The drone is made by the Chinese model aircraft manufacturer Skywalker Technology Co., Ltd., which also produces fuselages and organizes the delivery of kits to Russia,' GUR added. 'Delivery is carried out through third-party companies.' In addition, the barrage versions of the UAV are guided to targets by an operator similar to the way first-person view drones work, GUR stated. The Gerbera is equipped with 'a Chinese camera with a three-axis suspension Topotek KHY10S90 and a Xingkai Tech Mesh Network XK-F358 modem.' It’s powered by 'a DLE60 engine - manufactured by the Chinese Mile Hao Xiang Technology Co, Ltd,' GUR added. 'In the summer of 2024, this company came under US sanctions for supplies to Russia.' According to GUR’s War Sanctions database of Russian weapons containing foreign components, there are 29 in the Gerbera drones. Earlier this month, we reported that (GUR) claimed it found dozens of Western-made components in the Russian S-70 Okhotnik-B (Hunter-B) flying wing unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) downed last month in a case of friendly fire.

F-4 Phantoms Tear Through Turkey To Mark 50 Years Of Service	Turkey has celebrated half a century of operations with the legendary F-4E Phantom fighter, with a spectacular event showcasing close-quarters fly-bys, as well as an ‘elephant walk’ at the type’s last main operating base in the country. While the days of the Turkish ‘Rhino’ have been numbered for some time, the turbulent nature of the country’s fighter force means the jets have shown remarkable longevity and are still important frontline assets. The 50th-anniversary event for the Turkish Air Force F-4E took place over the weekend at Eskişehir in northwestern Turkey, where the local air base is home to the service’s squadron flying the Phantom — 111 Filo 'Panter.' The occasion was marked in a suitable style for such a charismatic jet — and one that is no stranger to very low-level flying around the Anatolian region.

The upper sides of the jet carry a huge Turkish flag, while the belly is painted with the famous 'Spook' character found across the global Phantom community ever since it first appeared in the late 1950s. Most dramatically, on Saturday 16th, the anniversary jet and at least one other standard-painted F-4E performed high- and low-speed passes down a river valley, roughly a two-and-a-half-hour drive from the base. This provided gathered photographers and eyewitnesses with a never-to-be-forgotten experience that showcased the raw power of this classic Cold War jet.

On the afternoon of Sunday 17th, the anniversary jet got airborne from Eskişehir as part of a four-ship, making several fly-pasts over the base. In the meantime, another six F-4Es taxied from various hardened aircraft shelters to the other end of the runway. When the four-ship landed, they all formed up on the ground to perform an elephant walk — an airpower exercise designed to demonstrate the readiness of large numbers of aircraft, typically in anticipation of a major contingency, but also for commemorative purposes.

Photo by Ali Atmaca/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu Photo by Ali Atmaca/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu The story of the F-4E with the Turkish Air Force, or Türk Hava Kuvvetleri, dates back to June 1974, when the first of an initial batch of 40 of the jets began to arrive in the country, ordered under the Peace Diamond I program. The deliveries were interrupted by an arms embargo imposed after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in the same year. A follow-on order in 1977 comprised 32 more F-4Es and eight RF-4Es for reconnaissance duties, although the last of the Turkish ‘Recce Rhinos’ were retired in 2015. Several more batches of former U.S. Air Force F-4Es were also obtained, with a total of 233 Phantoms of both versions eventually going onto the Turkish Air Force’s books. Such was the F-4’s popularity that examples were still being accepted in the early 1990s, by which time the more advanced F-16 was well established in service.

The modernization was led by Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI) and included structural and avionics work. The upgraded avionics include an Elta EL/M-2032 multi-mode radar, digital glass cockpit, wide-angle head-up display (HUD), and hands on throttle and stick (HOTAS) controls. The Terminator’s armory is also notably expanded, with weapons now including the Israeli-made Popeye standoff missile, as well as the indigenous Roketsan SOM for use against land and sea targets. Other stores include the HGK 500-pound INS/GPS-guided bomb, KGK 500-pound or 1,000-pound glide bomb, and the LGK-82 — an indigenous version of the 500-pound GBU-12 laser-guided bomb. Photo by Ali Atmaca/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu Photo by Ali Atmaca/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu The name of the Terminator 2020 indicated that it was expected to remain in service until around 2020, but fate has determined that the Turkish F-4E should serve a while longer. Today, Turkey — with a fleet reportedly numbering between 30 and 40 aircraft — is one of the last three operators of the type, the others being its regional rival Greece and Iran. At one point, it was expected that the F-4E would be replaced by F-35A stealth fighters. However, when Ankara decided to buy Russian-made S-400 air defense systems it was kicked out of the Joint Strike Fighter program, and the Phantom’s obvious successor was gone. Photo by Ali Atmaca/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu Photo by Ali Atmaca/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu As of now, it’s conceivable that the Turkish F-4Es might remain active until around 2030, at which point they could be replaced by the TF Kaan next-generation fighter. At the same time, there remain questions about the viability of this project, especially when it comes to sourcing engines and, even if it all goes to plan, the Kaan won’t begin to enter service until 2030, at the earliest. With this situation very likely in mind, Ankara has meanwhile also made efforts to acquire interim equipment, which would likely also displace the F-4Es. Earlier this year, U.S. President Joe Biden signaled that he wanted lawmakers to approve the sale of additional F-16s to Turkey 'without delay.' Soon after, the U.S. State Department approved a possible Foreign Military Sale to Turkey of 40 new F-16C/D Block 70 fighters, plus the upgrade of 79 existing aircraft to F-16V configuration. Turkey already operates an enormous F-16 fleet but efforts to acquire more had long been stalled. That also prompted Ankara to look elsewhere, including potentially buying Eurofighter Typhoons. More recently, there have even been suggestions that the F-35 could be back on the table for Turkey, although only if it agrees to give up its controversial S-400s once and for all. To date, however, no deal has been signed for additional F-16s or Typhoons, meaning that Turkish skies will continue to reverberate to the sound of F-4s for some time to come.

UK’s New SPEAR 3 Mini Cruise Missile Succeeds In First End-To-End...	The SPEAR 3, a precision-guided standoff munition that the U.K. Ministry of Defense describes as the 'cruise missile of the future,' has been test-fired, paving the way for it to arm British F-35B stealth fighters, as well as Typhoon multirole combat aircraft. While offering several key advantages over certain other comparable weapons, the SPEAR 3 program has been mired in delays for some time now, not all of which are the result of problems directly related to the missile. In the meantime, it’s now badly needed, with British F-35Bs having no standoff air-to-ground weapon for the time being. As we have discussed before, the SPEAR 3 is essentially a miniature cruise missile, powered by a small Pratt & Whitney TJ-150-3 turbojet engine. Combined with pop-out wings, this allows it to hit targets at a reported range of more than 62 miles, flying at a high subsonic speed. Other accounts have attributed it with a range of more than 87 miles. Armed with the SPEAR 3 test round, the Typhoon heads toward the Vidsel range in Sweden. Crown Copyright The missile uses a tri-mode seeker which offers radar, infrared, and laser homing. The SPEAR 3 can autonomously identify and prosecute targets or target coordinates can be sent to the missile via datalink, exploiting the launch platform’s sensors or those of third parties. It can be used against mobile and relocatable targets, as well as ones that are more heavily defended, or otherwise challenging to prosecute. When striking its target via laser seeker — especially useful for moving targets — guidance can be provided by an aircraft overhead or by a suitably equipped team of soldiers on the ground nearby. Typical targets include ships, tanks, defended structures, and moving vehicles and it’s especially relevant for destruction of enemy air defense (SEAD) missions, which involve attacking hostile air defense systems. An artist’s impression of the SPEAR 3 in flight. MBDA The U.K. Ministry of Defense announced yesterday that the SPEAR 3 munition — developed by the pan-European missile house MBDA — had completed a recent firing campaign, which saw it launched from a Typhoon FGR4 from 41 Test and Evaluation Squadron. The trials were conducted at the Vidsel range in northern Sweden, within the Arctic Circle, reportedly in mid-October. While this was the first time that the SPEAR 3 was launched against an actual test target, the weapon wasn’t fitted with a warhead. Instead, it carried a telemetry unit, which gathered data on the mock engagement, which involved a 'high-altitude and high-speed release' before zeroing in on a decommissioned tank. The SPEAR 3 is a steep terminal trajectory before striking a main battle tank target at the Vidsel range. MBDA The Swedish test was billed as the 'first successful guided firing trial of the missile,' although it’s worth noting that, as long ago as 2016, a prototype version of the SPEAR 3 was launched at Aberporth in Wales, also from a Typhoon. A spokesperson for MBDA explained how the two tests differed, with the Videl campaign being the first guided firing of the SPEAR 3, as part of the formal qualification — a key step toward declaring the weapon operational. 'The trial demonstrated the end-to-end function and performance of the system from initialization, launch, and transition to free flight, the conduct of pre-programmed maneuvers, and engagement of a target,' the spokesperson added. 'This guided firing was conducted using a SPEAR three-pack launcher, which uses the same sub-systems (including the pneumatic ejection system) as the four-pack launcher for F-35.' In contrast, the 2016 trial served as 'a technology demonstration conducted during the project’s assessment phase, testing the missile’s airframe, navigation, and propulsion systems to increase technical maturity and de-risk the program ahead of the launch of the weapon development phase. The missile was a prototype standard and there was no target selection and engagement functionality in the 2016 trial.' The orange-painted SPEAR 3 test round on the three-pack launcher under the wing of the Typhoon. Crown Copyright In addition, for the 2016 trial, the missile was launched directly from the aircraft’s pylon rather than a dedicated launcher, and the prototype missile was suitably modified to use the existing pylon interface. Returning to the Vidsel trial, U.K. Minister for the Armed Forces, Luke Pollard, issued the following statement: 'The successful trial of the pioneering SPEAR missile marks a significant leap forward in UK Armed Forces’ capabilities, ensuring our Royal Navy and Royal Air Force personnel are equipped with cutting-edge technology to protect our nation.' Another view of the SPEAR 3-armed Typhoon during the test mission at Vidsel. Crown Copyright Matthew Brown, SPEAR Team Leader at the Defense Equipment and Support (DE&S) branch, which handles procurement for the U.K. Ministry of Defense, added: 'This trial was a key step on the way to delivering SPEAR to the UK front line, where it will provide a new capability to defeat the most complex air defense systems, enabling pilots to fly and fight wherever they’re needed in defense of the U.K. and its allies.' As for the next phases of testing, the same MBDA spokesperson confirmed to TWZ that the telemetry and flight termination sub-system fitted in place of a warhead for the Vidsel trial is sufficient to gather all data needed to support system development and model validation, as part of the guided firing program. Meanwhile, the multi-mode warhead, arming, and fuzing systems have already successfully been trialed at the system and sub-system levels. The Typhoon test ship is seen from the cockpit of a Saab Gripen chase plane. Crown Copyright Next up, there will be full test firings using a live warhead, to be conducted by the U.K. Royal Air Force as part of the end-user’s service evaluation trials, although no date for this was given. In the past, we have compared the British-made weapon with the U.S. GBU-53/B Small Diameter Bomb II, better known as StormBreaker, with the major difference being the turbojet engine in the SPEAR 3, which means it has more range and can reach its targets faster than the unpowered glide bomb. Its speed also lends itself to survivability. An artist’s impression of the GBU-53/B Small Diameter Bomb II, or StormBreaker. Raytheon As well as the Typhoon — which already carries the Brimstone precision-guided munition from which the SPEAR 3 was derived — the new missile will arm the U.K.’s fleet of F-35B short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) stealth fighters. These also deploy aboard the U.K. Royal Navy’s two Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers. Each F-35B jet will be able to carry up to eight SPEAR 3 missiles at a time, as well as a pair of Meteor or AIM-120 AMRAAM beyond-visual-range air-to-air missiles (BVRAAMs) — all of them accommodated internally, preserving the jet’s low-observable characteristics. At one time, consideration was also being given to adding capacity for underwing launchers on the F-35B, for a maximum of 16 SPEAR 3 missiles. An artist’s impression of an F-35B armed with SPEAR 3 and Meteor. MBDA While SPEAR stands for Selective Precision Effects At Range, the ‘3’ in the designation of the new missile refers to its place within a portfolio of different air-to-ground weapons that are being developed for the U.K. Armed Forces. Within this structure, SPEAR 1 refers to the Paveway IV precision-guided munition, while SPEAR 2 is the Brimstone, SPEAR 4 is a midlife upgrade for the Storm Shadow cruise missile, and SPEAR 5 is the Future Cruise/Anti-Ship Weapon, which is being pursued as a joint project by the United Kingdom and France. An infographic showing future U.K. F-35 weapons, (1) ASRAAM, currently carried; (2) Meteor; (3) SPEAR 3. All of these cam be carried simultaneously. MBDA In total, the United Kingdom is investing around $8.2 billion in missile programs via the manufacturer MBDA, which is responsible for the SPEAR 3 as well as Brimstone and Storm Shadow, the Sea Venom anti-ship missile, and the CAMM and Sea Viper naval air defense missiles. While the investment is considerable, it should be recalled that the development of the SPEAR 3 has not been free of problems. In 2021, MBDA and BAE Systems announced they had secured funding from the British and Italian governments to complete the integration of the SPEAR 3 on both the F-35B and the conventional takeoff and landing F-35A. While the United Kingdom has only acquired the F-35B, Italy operates both versions. The Typhoon test and evaluation launches in Sweden, carrying a single SPEAR 3 missile. The missile is carried in an inverted carriage position, righting itself after launch, and then deploying its wings. Crown Copyright Chris Ryding At one point, integration of the SPEAR 3 and Meteor on the F-35B was expected by the 'middle of this decade,' while a date of 2027 at the earliest was given in a government report dated February 2022. Earlier this year, the U.K. government said that integration of the SPEAR 3 and Meteor on the F-35B would be completed by the 'end of the decade.' This leaves the British F-35B without a standoff air-to-ground weapon in the meantime, with only the unpowered Paveway IV available. Paveway IV precision-guided bombs prepared for carriage by F-35Bs aboard HMS Queen Elizabeth during a live firing exercise. Crown Copyright The SPEAR 3 program has also been dogged by delays in integrating new weapons on the F-35B. Above all, compatibility with the SPEAR 3 relies upon the F-35 having the Block 4 upgrade, which promises to bring other major advances to the aircraft, including a new multifunction active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar designated as AN/APG-85 and advanced electronic warfare capabilities. Block 4 relies upon a new suite of hardware and software for the F-35, known as Technology Refresh-3 (TR-3), something that has been described as the stealth fighter’s new ‘computer backbone,’ but which has also had a very protracted development. Delays with TR-3 left F-35s being parked and not delivered after they were built, a situation that continued for around a year before deliveries restarted. Those previous jets left waiting at the manufacturing facility also now need to be retrofitted with TR-3. As far as we know, the United Kingdom also plans to bring earlier F-35Bs up to Block 4 standard, to ensure commonality, although there remain questions about just how feasible this is. British F-35Bs lined up on HMS Prince of Wales at the end of Exercise Strike Warrior earlier this year. Crown Copyright AS1 Amber Mayall RAF Against this backdrop, there are also lingering questions about the number of F-35Bs the United Kingdom will buy. While the U.K. Ministry of Defense has long said it’s committed to buying 138 F-35Bs, repeated budgetary concerns mean that this figure is now widely viewed as being unrealistic. As it stands the United Kingdom has ordered 48 F-35Bs, known as Tranche 1, and has confirmed plans to place a Tranche 2 order for 27 F-35Bs, although this is yet to be signed off. Whatever the future F-35B fleet looks like, the SPEAR 3 looks set to provide a very valuable capability and one that will be shared by the Typhoon. Further sales appear likely, with Italy committed to the program, and compatibility with the Typhoon and F-35A/B opens up a potentially wide range of additional export customers. As well as the SPEAR 3, MBDA is also developing the SPEAR-EW, with the explosive payload replaced by an electronic warfare jammer and decoy functions. Ultimately, the aim is for the SPEAR 3 and SPEAR-EW to work together to overwhelm enemy air defenses and protect friendly aircraft and even other missiles. The possibility of harnessing the capabilities of these effectors in a fully networked fashion is significant and TWZ has previously looked more deeply at the implications of these kinds of swarms of mini-cruise missiles. An artist’s impression of the SPEAR-EW in flight. MBDA A spokesperson for MBDA confirmed to TWZ that work on the SPEAR-EW is currently ongoing under a rapid design phase contract from the U.K. Ministry of Defense. Although it has been subject to delays, some of which are attributable to problems in the F-35 program, the SPEAR 3 is now finally making tangible progress on the path toward operational service with the United Kingdom. Once it arrives, it should provide a powerful new capability — especially when combined with the stealthy F-35.

First Stand-In Attack Missile Delivered To USAF	Flight testing of the U.S. Air Force's Stand-In Attack Weapon (SiAW) missile is now set to begin following the delivery of an initial test article. Derived from the AGM-88G missile designed primarily to punch holes in enemy air defenses, SiAW is under development to offer a broader high-speed strike capability against time-sensitive ground targets, including ballistic and cruise missile launchers, air and missile defense nodes, electronic warfare systems, and even anti-satellite weapons. Northrop Grumman, the prime contractor for the AGM-88G and SiAW, released a brief statement about the delivery of the new test missile, 'which is designed to verify that the launch aircraft can safely carry and separate the weapon,' along with a picture of it, seen at the top of this story, today. The company received its latest SiAW contract, valued at approximately $705 million, in September 2023. The U.S. Navy has already been leading the very active development of the AGM-88G, also known as the Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile-Extended Range (AARGM-ER), for years now. The first AARGM-ER live-fire flight test occurred in 2021. A US Navy F/A-18F Super Hornet launches an AGM-88G AARGM-ER during a test. Northrop Grumman Specific details about range, speed, and other capabilities of the SiAW, as well as AGM-88G, remain limited. It is worth noting that Lockheed Martin unveiled a hypersonic missile called Mako, which it said was originally developed for the SiAW competition, earlier this year. We don't know whether or not this means that SiAW (and by extension the AARGM-ER) might then also be capable of reaching hypersonic or near-hypersonic speeds, including in a terminal stage sprint. Lockheed Martin, as well as L3Harris, withdrew from the running for continued work on SiAW before Northrop Grumman received its contract last year. It is also known that AARGM-ER, at least in its baseline configuration, shares the same guidance and flight control systems as the preceding combat-proven AGM-88E AARGM. As such, as The War Zone has written previously: 'AARGM-ER contains a multi-mode guidance package containing a GPS-assisted inertial navigation system, as well as a millimeter-wave radar that can locate targets even if they stop emitting radiofrequency or other signals or even begin to move. The missile’s guidance and datalink package also have the capability to network with off-board sources, meaning a launching aircraft can fire the weapon without even having acquired a target’s emissions, instead relying on other platforms’ data to target and prosecute an attack. The anti-radiation missile can also reportedly relay data in its final moments to confirm whether or not it successfully struck its intended target.'

USN A Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) briefing slide showing what is new on the AGM-88G and what is common with the older AGM-88E. USN With the multiple guidance mode options, AARGM and AARGM-ER also already have a secondary general air-to-surface strike capability, including against ships and targets ashore. How exactly SiAW will differ from AARGM-ER, which the Air Force is also acquiring, to provide expanded capability against a broader array of target sets is unclear, but official budget documents explicitly mention an 'improved warhead/fuze.' 'The Stand-in Attack Weapon (SiAW) system will provide capability to strike rapidly re-locatable targets that create the Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) environment,' the Air Force's 2025 Fiscal Year budget request, released back in March, also says. 'SiAW targets include Theater Ballistic Missile Launchers, Land Attack and Anti-Ship Cruise Missile Launchers, Jammers, Anti-Satellite Systems, and Integrated Air Defense Systems.' SiAW, as described now, offers a capability that is particularly relevant to the U.S. military's current over-arching planning focus around a potential high-end conflict with China. The Chinese People's Liberation Army has already made considerable investments in the development and fielding of more advanced and longer-range air defense, anti-ship, and electronic warfare capabilities, as well as ones intended to challenge America's historic dominance in the space domain. Having multiple ways to suppress and destroy these A2/AD capabilities, and do so quickly and effectively across a broad front, will be critical to succeeding in any future major fight in the Pacific region. With all this in mind, it is not surprising that the Air Force plans for its F-35A stealth fighters to be the first aircraft in inventory to be armed with SiAWs. F-35As will also be able to carry the missiles in their internal bays, allowing them to employ this new capability while in their most stealthy configuration. F-35As and Cs will also be able to carry AARGM-ER internally. A picture showing a fit check of the AARGM-ER design in the internal bay of an F-35A or C variant. Orbital ATK www.twz.com The Air Force has also said that the goal is for SiAW to be part of the arsenal of other unspecified 'Future Advanced Aircraft.' The service has been working toward acquiring a new sixth-generation crewed stealth combat jet as part of its Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative, but the future of that effort is now very uncertain, as you can read more about here. The B-21 Raider stealth bomber and various different drones might also be SiAW launch platforms. SiAW, as well as AARGM-ER, could also offer non-stealthy platforms a useful tool for engaging air defense and other targets that might suddenly pop up. Depending on the weapon's range, it might be possible to employ it from beyond the reach of certain threats using third-party targeting data. Other branches of the U.S. military, as well as foreign allies and partners (a number of which are already moving to buy AARGM-ERs), could be interested in SiAW, as well. Northrop Grumman has also been working on surface-to-surface strike derivatives of the AARGM-ER/SiAW family, which could be fired from ground-based launchers or ships. A rendering of the Advanced Reactive Strike (ARES) missile, a proposed ground-launched derivative of the AARGM-ER/SiAW family. Northrop Grumman As it stands now, the Air Force's SiAW testing plan, which is benefitting greatly from the work already done on AARGM-ER, includes at least four live-fire flights. After that, Northrop Grumman says the goal is for the service to take 'delivery of SiAW leave-behind prototype missiles and test assets' to support continued development and work toward operational fielding. The service hopes to reach initial operational capability with the missile sometime in 2026. The delivery of the new SiAW asset is another important step forward in the ongoing development of what could be a particularly critical component of the Air Force's future arsenal.

Ukraine Now Allowed To Use Long-Range Missiles Deep Into Russia: ...	In a major policy shift with two months left in office, the Biden administration will allow Ukraine to use U.S.-produced and donated Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) short-range ballistic missiles deep inside Russia. The missiles, which can hit targets of up to about 190 miles away, are likely to first be used in Russia’s Kursk region, according to The New York Times, citing U.S. officials. The publication was the first to report the administration's change of heart. The policy change was spurred by the presence of North Korean troops fighting in Kursk, the officials said. Ukrainian Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine's Defense Intelligence Directorate, told us on Sunday that there are 12,000 North Korean troops now in Kursk. Pyongyang could eventually send 100,000 troops to Russia, Bloomberg reported on Sunday. The long-range weapons Biden has approved are likely to be initially fired against Russian and North Korean troops in defense of Ukrainian forces in the Kursk region of western Russia w/Adam Entous & @julianbarnes Eric Schmitt (@EricSchmittNYT) November 17, 2024 Russia has sent about 50,000 troops, including North Koreans, into Kursk to take back territory lost during Ukraine’s three-month-old invasion. It marks the second attempt by Russia to push Ukraine out of Kursk. So far, it appears the Russians have been suffering large losses of personnel and equipment without having cut too deeply into Ukraine's Kursk salient. Likely targets for Ukraine include logistics nodes, supply lines, ammunition storage and equipment storage sites and large gatherings of troops, adding additional stresses on Russia's attempts to dislodge Ukraine before Donald Trump takes office in Janurary. You can see some potential targets in the following map. U.S. to allow Ukraine to use long-range weapons inside Russia, NYT reports. This could be a game-changer for Ukraine, which would allow them to challenge Russian logistics supply lines and air dominance.Below is a map of potential targets from ISW pic.twitter.com/wF23YHm87l&mdash; Jane Lytvynenko (@JaneLytv) November 17, 2024 'First and foremost it is strategic deterrence conventional weapon in current circumstances,' a former high-ranking Ukrainian officer told us on Sunday. 'Secondly, we should be allowed to hit high-priority targets far away from the Ukrainian border. As for now, I would focus not only on military targets but also on military industry objects, gas stations, electrical grids etc. Our strategy will depend on how many and what range ATACMS we get.' Throughout the all-out war, the Biden administration has been cautious about allowing the use of U.S.-supplied weapons in Russia, fearing a backlash by Vladimir Putin, who controls a nuclear-armed military. However, there have been changes in that policy in the past. Back in May, Biden allowed Ukraine to use M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, with a range of about 50 miles, against targets inside Russia bordering Kharkiv Oblast. It was in response to a Russian counteroffensive in that area. However, the use of ATACMS was prohibited. Ukraine has been using both weapons to devastating effect inside its own borders. Ukraine has also been using U.S.-donated Joint Direct Attack Munition-Extended Range (JDAM-ER) and Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) precision-guided bombs, as well as French-donated AASM-250 Hammer rocket-assisted bombs in Ukraine and Kursk and SCALP-EG air-launched cruise missiles and similar British British Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missiles on Russian targets in Ukraine. This move could also lead to France and the U.K. easing restrictions on the use of SCALPs and Storm Shadows. A Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS), launched by an M142 HIMARS in service with Ukraine Photo by Serhii Mykhalchuk/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images It is possible this shift could also be extended to other long-range weapons the All this comes ahead of Trump's new presidency, which could see aid to Ukraine greatly diminished or cut off. While saying he can quickly end the war, Trump has yet to offer any specifics and it is unclear exactly just how he will deal with the war, especially if a peace deal cannot be reached. You can read more about this in our deep dive here. We will likely find out about the first use of ATACMS in Kursk when videos emerge on social media of missile fragments, or Ukraine makes a public announcement. While they will certainly help, it is believed that Ukraine has only a relatively small supply of these missiles. However, even that puts Russian and North Korean troops in greater danger.
