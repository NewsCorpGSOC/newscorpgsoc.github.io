Mobile Launcher That Can Fire Four Times As Weapons As HIMARS Eme...	A new palletized ground-based launcher concept that can be loaded with up to two dozen 227mm guided artillery rockets at a time – four times what an M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) can pack at once – recently broke cover. The launch system is designed to be carried on a 10-wheeled cargo truck and can also fire other weapons, including short-range ballistic missiles and surface-to-air interceptors. Lockheed Martin displayed the launcher on a U.S. Marine Corps 10&#215;10 MKR18 Logistics Vehicle System Replacement (LVSR) truck at the Human-Machine Integration Summit IV last week. U.S. Army's Futures Command hosted the event at Texas A&M University’s George H.W. Bush Combat Development Complex (BCDC).

Oshkosh Defense manufactures both vehicles, which evolved from the . A Marine MKR18 LVSR truck with a more typical payload (a shipping container). USMC 'This Lockheed Martin proof-of-concept configuration demonstrates how a logistics vehicle in the field can rapidly transition to a launcher delivering a deep magazine of GMLRS, ATACMS or PrSM,' a company spokesperson told The War Zone. The 227mm Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) family of 227mm precision-guided artillery rockets, along with the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) and Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) short-range ballistic missiles, are all Lockheed Martin products. The company collectively refers to them as the MLRS Family of Munitions (MFOM). Members of the MFOM all come in standardized ammunition 'pods,' which can hold six GMLRS rockets, two PrSMs, or a single ATACMS. The wheeled M142 HIMARS can be loaded with one of these pods at a time, while tracked M270 MLRS launch vehicles can carry two at once.

Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin A HIMARS launcher fires an ATACMS missile. US Army A US Army HIMARS launcher fires an ATACMS missile. US Army Whether any other munitions might already be compatible with the new launcher concept is unclear. Follow-on variants and derivates of the PrSM are already in active development for the Army. This includes a version with an additional seeker system that has a demonstrated capability to engage moving ships. There are also plans for a type with a maximum range of at least 1,000 kilometers (approximately 621 miles), which could incorporate an air-breathing propulsion system. The baseline PrSM has a range of at least 310 miles (500 kilometers), which could grow to 400 miles (650 kilometers) in the future. A PrSM is fired during a test. Lockheed Martin The new launcher concept 'may also be applied to Integrated Air Missile Defense interceptors,' the Lockheed Martin spokesperson did tell The War Zone, but provided no specific examples. Lockheed Martin is the manufacturer of the combat-proven PAC-3 series. The PAC-3 family is currently used in the Patriot surface-to-air missile system, but is also now being developed in a configuration compatible with Mk 41 Vertical Launch Systems (VLS). Variants and derivatives of the Mk 41, yet another part of Lockheed Martin's portfolio, are found on various U.S. and foreign warships, as well as in static and mobile ground-based configurations. A PAC-3 MSE interceptor seen being fired from a standard launcher used with the Patriot surface-to-air missile system. DOD A Patriot launcher fires a newer PAC-3-series missile during a test. DoD The latest PAC-3 MSE variant is said to be just over 17 feet long (5.3 meters) in length, which is notably longer than the MFOM pod form factor. The launch system shown at the recent Human-Machine Integration Summit does appear to have enough space to load longer weapons. PAC-3-series interceptors already offer greater magazine depth for the Patriot surface-to-air missile system using existing trailer-based launchers, as shown in this graphic. Lockheed Martin A graphic showing various Patriot launcher types and possible load configurations. Lockheed Martin There are surface-to-air interceptors from other companies that might also be options for use with this new launcher concept. For instance, the Army is in the process of acquiring the Enduring Shield system, which currently uses the AIM-9X Sidewinder as its primary interceptor. The service already wants to acquire another missile offering capability akin to the AIM-120D Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) for that system. The Marine Corps is also separately working to field a service-specific version of Israel's Iron Dome system and the Tamir interceptor that goes with it. It is also worth noting here that an LVSR-based launcher has been used in previous testing of the Operational Fires (OpFires) hypersonic missile, which is substantially larger than an MFOM pod. OpFires is a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) program. Lockheed Martin has been developing the missile, which is tipped with an unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicle, in cooperation with Northrop Grumman and Dynetics (a subsidiary of Leidos). A rendering of the LVSR-based OpFires launcher loaded with three of those hypersonic missiles. Lockheed Martin Altogether, Lockheed Martin says its new ground-based launcher concept offers a way 'to deploy offensive and defensive fires from the same platform and logistics footprint.' The palletized launcher does certainly offer more onboard magazine depth than HIMARS or MLRS on a mobile platform. It's unclear whether the launch system can be unloaded and employed from a static position on land or the deck of a ship, but this seems very plausible and could expand its overall flexibility. In an air and missile defense configuration, the launch system could also leverage emerging networking capabilities like the Army's Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS) to tie in with existing and future radars and other sensors. At the same time, a system that requires an LVSR-sized truck to move it around is by definition relatively large. HIMARS was notably developed specifically to provide MLRS-like capability, but in a package that was more readily deployable, especially by air via a C-130-sized aircraft. The value of the HIMARS' ability to conduct shoot-and-scoot operations and its general mobility have been on full display in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. HIMARS softening up Russian lines.

The Typhon system, also known as the Mid-Range Capability (MRC), includes trailer-based Mk 41 VLS-derived launchers capable of firing Tomahawk cruise missiles, as well as multi-purpose SM-6 missiles. A single Typhon launcher can be loaded with just four missiles at once. A group of four launchers, as well as a trailer-based command post, which form the core of a single Typhon system battery. US Army A full battery set of four Typhon launchers, as well as the trailer-based command post. US Army 'So, the Mid-Range Capability, we fielded it, we have put it into the theater, but we’re learning lessons on how we can improve the next evolutions of that,' Army Col. Michael Rose, commander of the 3rd Multi-Domain Task Force (MDTF) headquartered at Fort Shafter in Hawaii, said at the Association of the U.S. Army's (AUSA) main annual convention in October. 'How do we make it more mobile? How do we make it smaller? How do we make it more agile? How do we employ it most effectively and how do we sustain it? A lot of those lessons are feeding back into our RDT&E [research, development, test, and evaluations] and acquisitions professionals to improve and enhance that new operational capability.' The Army has also been experimenting with an uncrewed HIMARS derivative called the Autonomous Multi-domain Launcher (AML) with a particular focus on expanding ground-based stand-off strike capacity without significant additional manpower requirements. An uncrewed Autonomous Multi-domain Launcher (AML) fires a rocket during a test. US Army For its part, the Marine Corps is currently pushing ahead with fielding much smaller, remotely operated ground-based missile launchers derived from the 4&#215;4 Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) rather than systems based on larger platforms like the LVSR. This is part of an ongoing reorientation of the service's entire force structure around concepts of operations that focus heavily on the ability to relatively rapidly redeploy and redeploy forces from one forward location to another. Observations from the conflict in Ukraine have prompted significant new interest in the MFOM, especially in Europe, though still primarily paired with the lighter-weight HIMARS launcher. Lockheed Martin is also working with Germany's Rheinmetall on a new wheeled launcher, the Global Mobile Artillery Rocket System (GMARS), which can be loaded with two MFOM pods at a time. Lockheed Martin's new palletized launcher concept could still be attractive to the U.S. military for certain purposes, especially given its flexibility to be used for surface-to-surface strikes and air and missile defense, as well as allies and partners with different mobility and deployability requirements.

Flight Test Boss Details How China Threat Is Rapidly Changing Ope...	It is an incredible time to be involved in the world of U.S. Air Force flight-test. What we're doing right now is designed to innovate and accelerate our next generation of capability. We're modernizing so many of our weapon systems and many new technologies are all going through testing at the same time,' enthused Brig. Gen. Douglas 'Beaker' Wickert, commander of the 412th Test Wing at Edwards Air Force Base in California. 'Secretary Kendall has been very clear that we are out of time, that our Air Force has never been older or smaller than it is right now, and that the People’s Liberation Army has been specifically designed to defeat us.' 'The investments we're making right now in modernization and testing for the USAF are designed for success and aimed at changing Chairman Xi's calculus about pushing back aggressively against the international rules based order. What we are doing here and across USAF flight-testing is extremely consequential.' The installation at the heart of American military flight-testing for more than 80 years, known today as Edwards AFB, is located in California’s northwestern Mojave desert. This test center has witnessed pioneering advances in aviation since 1942, including a Golden Age in the 1950s that saw an exotic assortment of new military aircraft and X-planes under frantic development in the skies above this sprawling base. A B-1B Lancer from the Edwards AFB test fleet. Jamie Hunter Today, Edwards AFB is extremely busy as the resident 412th Test Wing supports multiple efforts to rapidly advance USAF capabilities. Just like on Oct. 14, 1947, when Charles E. 'Chuck' Yeager became the first human to exceed the speed of sound, or when William J. 'Pete' Knight flew the highly modified X-15A-2 on Oct. 3, 1967, to a top speed of Mach 6.72 (4,520 mph), going faster and higher than any other piloted winged vehicle other than the Space Shuttle, testing at Edwards stands at the bleeding edge of aviation innovation. Flying operations at Edwards today are complex and diverse and they include ushering in a new era of advanced autonomous uncrewed capabilities that make full use of emerging revolutions in technology, especially artificial intelligence (AI), as well as shepherding new aircraft like the B-21 Raider and T-7A Red Hawk into service. The War Zone sat down with Wickert in his office at Edwards for a detailed discussion covering some of the most important subjects that are impacting USAF flight-testing at this crucial time. USAF test empire Wickert began his USAF career as an F-16 pilot, and he has been involved in the military flight-test community for the past two decades, with many accolades including being a professor at the Air Force Academy. His role commanding the 412th Test Wing affords him an overarching, top down overview of all USAF testing. 'From here, you are afforded a really good vantage point to assess the state of the test world,' said Wickert. Brig. Gen. Wickert in his office at Edwards AFB. USAF CHLOE BONACCORSI The 412th Test Wing at Edwards and the 96th Test Wing at Eglin AFB, Florida, both sit under the umbrella of the Air Force Test Center, which is headed up by Maj. Gen. Scott Cain, and is also headquartered at Edwards. 'The test community is relatively small, on both the development test side and the partnering operational test side,' Wickert explained. 'We really have to keep our finger on the pulse to understand, with the finite resources that we have, how we facilitate the greatest return on investment, on time, and on our people. As we look at the work we expect to be running here over the next three years, we think we need as many as 1,600 new personnel to work here in our testing ecosystem. In addition to all of that, we need the right type and number of mission control rooms, chase aircraft, and tanker aircraft. We must balance those needs to make sure that we're moving everything through smoothly, and so when a system under test is not quite ready, we can rapidly reallocate resources where necessary to achieve success.' A new Boeing T-7A trainer on test at Edwards AFB. USAF Bryce Bennett While ensuring the correct physical assets are in place to meet demand, there’s also a pressure to evolve flight testing, which is traditionally an extremely laborious process, but essential in procedure to meet safety and capability targets. 'We are looking for opportunities to accelerate our testing,' said Wickert. 'Our test ecosystem consists of five key things. Firstly, there’s our ground resources, things like wind tunnels and high-speed test tracks, the Joint Simulation Environment [JSE], which is essentially a digital test and training resource.We also have flight resources, things like one-of-a-kind aircraft that are constructed with built-in string gauges and accelerometers to make them highly instrumented aircraft, so you know exactly what the system under test is doing, to include the mission systems. Then we have our instrumental ranges that we are working to tie together. Here we have a western range alliance, that’s the Pacific Test Ranges near Point Mugu, the Nevada Test and Training Range, and the R-2508 complex.' 'There’s also the data. Particularly now as systems are getting more and more complex, we take terabytes of data off of every single test. Finally, there’s the highly educated people that work here. We have the USAF Test Pilot School at Edwards, we have almost 1,000 engineers, flight-test engineers, these are a national resource in our test engineering group. This is our test ecosystem and each of those elements are ripe for innovative and creative ways to accelerate our testing, and it’s our responsibility to do that.' An F-22 and F-35A from the Edwards-based test fleet. USAF Kyle Larson Evolving USAF testing USAF leadership is looking at an aggressive timeline with regard to the fielding of new platforms such as Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCAs) amid what the Pentagon calls calls Great Power Competition. Wickert and his team are charged with ensuring the flight-test ecosystem is geared up for efficient means to push such new technologies effectively and efficiently through the rigorous testing that’s needed to field advanced new capabilities. 'Right now we’re at a point as generation AI is coming along and it's a really exciting time. We're experimenting with ways to use new tools across the entire test process, from test planning to test execution, from test analysis to test reporting. With investments from the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office [CDAO] we have approved under Control Unclassified Information [CUI] a large language model that resides in the cloud, on a government system, where we can input a test description for an item under test and it will provide us with a Test Hazard Analysis [THA]. It will initially provide 10 points, and we can request another 10, and another 10, etc, in the format that we already use. It’s not a finished product, but it's about 90% there.' 'When we do our initial test brainstorming, it’s typically a very creative process, but that can take humans a long time to achieve. It’s often about coming up with things that people hadn’t considered. Now, instead of engineers spending hours working on this and creating the administrative forms, the AI program creates all of the points in the correct format, freeing up the engineers to do what humans are really good at – thinking critically about what it all means.' 'So we have an AI tool for THA, and now we’ve expanded it to generate test cards from our test plans that we use in the cockpit and in the mission control rooms. It uses the same large language model but trained on the test card format. So we input the detailed test plan, which includes the method of the test, measures of effectiveness, and we can ask it to generate test cards. Rather than spending a week generating these cards, it takes about two minutes!' The X-62A takes off from Edwards AFB. Jamie Hunter Wickert says the Air Force Test Center is also blending its AI tooling into test reporting to enable rapid analysis and 'quick look' reports. For example, audio recordings of debriefs are now able to be turned into written reports. 'That's old school debriefs being coupled with the AI tooling to produce a report that includes everything that we talked about in the audio and it produces it in a format that we use,' explained Wickert. 'There's also the AI that’s under test, when the system under test is the AI, such as the X-62A VISTA [Variable-stability In-flight Simulator Test Aircraft]. VISTA is a sandbox for testing out different AI agents, in fact I just flew it and we did a BVR [Beyond Visual Range] simulated cruise missile intercept under the AI control, it was amazing. We were 20 miles away from the target and I simply pushed a button to engage the AI agent and then we continued hands off and it flew the entire intercept and saddled up behind the target. That's an example of AI under test and we use our normal test procedures, safety planning, and risk management all apply to that.' 'There’s also AI assistance to test. In our flight-test control rooms, if we're doing envelope expansion, flutter, or loads, or handling qualities – in fact we’re about to start high angle-of-attack testing on the Boeing T-7, for example – we have engineers sitting there watching and monitoring from the control room. The broad task in this case is to compare the actual handling against predictions from the models to determine if the model is accurate. We do this as incremental step ups in envelope expansion, and when the reality and the model start to diverge, that's when we hit pause because we don’t understand the system itself or the model is wrong. An AI assistant in the control room could really help with real-time monitoring of tests and we are looking at this right now. It has a huge impact with respect to digital engineering and digital material management.' 'I was the project test pilot on the Greek Peace Xenia F-16 program. One example of that work was that we had to test a configuration with 600-gallon wing tanks and conformal tanks, which equated to 22,000 pounds of gas on a 20,000-pound airplane, so a highly overloaded F-16. We were diving at 1.2 mach, and we spent four hours trying to hit a specific test point. We never actually managed to hit it. That’s incredibly low test efficiency, but you’re doing it in a very traditional way – here's a test point, go out and fly the test point, with very tight tolerances. Then you get the results and compare them to the model. Sometimes we do that real time, linked up with the control room, and it can typically take five or 10 minutes for each one. So, there's typically a long time between test points before the engineer can say that the predictions are still good, you're cleared to the next test point.' A heavily-instrumented F-16D returns to Edwards AFB after a mission. Jamie Hunter 'AI in the control room can now do comparison work in real time, with predictive analysis and digital modeling. Instead of having a test card that says you need to fly at six Gs plus or minus 1/10th of a G, at 20,000 feet plus or minus 400 feet pressure altitude, at 0.8 mach plus or minus 0.05, now you can just fly a representative maneuver somewhere around 20,000 feet and make sure you get through 0.8 mach and just do some rollercoaster stuff and a turn. In real time in the control room you're projecting the continuous data that you're getting via the aircraft’s telemetry onto a reduced order model, and that’s the product.' 'When Dr Will Roper started trumpeting digital engineering, he was very clear that in the old days we graduated from a model to test. In the new era of digital engineering, we graduate from tests to a validated model. That’s with AI as an assistant, being smarter about how we do tests, with the whole purpose of being able to accelerate because the warfighter is urgently asking for the capability that we are developing.' Collaborative Combat Aircraft One of the clearest areas the USAF is looking to accelerate surrounds Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCAs), a new family of unmanned combat drones that are designed to work in concert with manned fighters and provide a force multiplying, highly autonomous, numerical edge in tactical aerial warfare. The USAF faces an incredibly complex and laborious task when it comes to testing, training with, and fielding CCAs. 'We need to break the problem down, then we need to integrate all the pieces back together, and it has multiple components,' explained Wickert. 'There's the physical challenge of actually getting a CCA to fly. Does it have sufficient thrust? Do we have the right control laws? That's going to largely be contractor led. Separately, in parallel, we are developing the autonomous agents that will actually be the brains that can take some higher order commands and execute those, at varying levels of autonomy.' The General Atomics XQ-67A Off-Board Sensing Station is currently in flight-testing with the manufacturer and the Air Force Research Laboratory. General Atomics Edwards is planned as the USAF’s home of CCA flight-test, and work is commencing to build a new CCA enclave here. 'Once it's mature and it's ready for integration, it'll come up here and it will fly from here. We have to actually connect it with a crewed fighter. Those tests have to happen in open air because there's so many uncertainties, we will need to prove that it actually works in a real world environment. Then there's weapon integration, that'll be a separate effort.' In terms of validating how the CCAs will be employed, much of this modeling will be undertaken in the Joint Simulation Environment (JSE). 'Once we have good validated models of how the CCA will work, it's very easy to take those models and put them into the JSE. Every new program now has to be JSE-compatible and must be able to integrate into digital test. The JSE is not a simulator. There are simulators that plug into JSE, there's domes you can sit and fly, but the JSE is an architecture that’s perfect for prototyping, developing, and working out how you are actually going to employ.' 'The digital test range runs using the JSE. That’s where we will figure out if a single F-22 pilot can control four CCAs, is that the right number, maybe it's two, maybe it depends on the scenario. I've got a task, you've got a threat over there, I need the CCA to create a diversion. All of that will be worked out first in the digital test and training range.' A flight-test engineer engaged in an F-16D test flight. USAF 'I can easily imagine that F-22 and F-35 pilots will routinely train with CCAs, just like they routinely train with an AIM-120 or an AIM-9X missile without ever actually having the missile leave the aircraft. They will live fly and train with them synthetically around them in a live virtual constructive situation, so I can see how that would work with a tablet. The digital test and training range means we can look at all of these different scenarios, perhaps that’s a 2035 scenario, this is the concept of developing the analysis of alternatives. We can experiment and work out if we were to get say 30 of these new platforms, would it change the game?' High tempo operations While the synthetic JSE provides valuable modeling, prototyping and training, actually bringing together real aircraft in live fly test events is critical in proving that different capabilities actually work in the real world. Bringing together a wealth of different aircraft and new systems is a complex and costly affair, and therefore a quartet of large force test exercises has been developed. 'We run Orange Flag from Edwards, plus we have Emerald Flag at Eglin in Florida for the long-range kill and communications elements, we have the 53rd Wing’s Black Flag at Nellis AFB, and also Gray Flag for the Navy, that’s run out of Point Mugu. Some programs that are well funded allow us to bring together lots of different nodes and sensors to test the new capability. There are also less well funded projects that might want to join in and have the opportunity to work in a complex scenario like one of the flag exercises. So really it’s a case of we are throwing a party and you're invited to come, bring all of your latest and greatest stuff and let’s see what works. That includes Army land systems, Navy ships – the full range of advanced systems.' This B-2A is assigned to the Edwards AFB test fleet. USAF AFTC Aerial Photographer Christian Turner 'We are busier here at Edwards now than we were in the 1980s. We’re testing the USAF’s newest airplane, the B-21, and at the same time testing the B-52 and all of its new upgrades including new engines and new radar. The USAF’s new trainer, the T-7 Redhawk, is also being tested here, and many other things in between. We call Edwards the center of the aerospace testing universe, but it’s actually more than that, because it's more than just the USAF flight-test here.' 'It’s very easy to motivate folks because right now is a time of consequence. If you want to know what the USAF of 2027 or 2035 or 2042 looks like, just look in the skies over Edwards Air Force Base because the Air Force that’s flying over Edwards is the Air Force that we're going to go to war with.'

Gray Eagle STOL Drone Flies From South Korean Amphibious Assault ...	The General Atomics Aeronautical Systems (GA-ASI) Gray Eagle STOL drone has undertaken its first experimental operations from a warship, taking off from the deck of the South Korean amphibious assault ship Dokdo. The Gray Eagle STOL — a design we have discussed in depth in the past — incorporates technology first demonstrated on the company’s Mojave, which was specifically developed with the ability to perform short takeoffs and landings, including from rough fields, with minimal support. The latest development adds to the aviation-capable warships that the wider family of Q-1 lineage drones have now operated from. Yesterday, Gray Eagle STOL launched from the ROK helicopter ship Dokdo (deck length, 653ft/199m).GE STOL gets up so quick, we might launch it off surfboards next. pic.twitter.com/H8GUuzQPLT&mdash; C. Mark Brinkley (@cmarkbrinkley) November 13, 2024 The Republic of Korea Navy (ROKN) confirmed the test took place yesterday, November 12, in the East Sea — the South Korean name for the Sea of Japan. Officials confirmed that this was the first time that a fixed-wing drone of any kind operated from an ROKN vessel. The Gray Eagle STOL drone came aboard the Dokdo disassembled and was then reassembled and tested for a week, before taking off from the deck of the vessel. The drone flew for roughly one hour, before landing at a Naval Air Command facility in Pohang, around 170 miles southeast of Seoul. The ROKN said that communications were maintained between the drone, the warship, and the Naval Air Command, although it’s unclear where the control station for the drone was located. As far as we know, the drone did not land on the Dokdo at any point in the trials. The Gray Eagle STOL at the rear of the flight deck of the Dokdo amphibious assault ship in the Sea of Japan. ROKN The Gray Eagle STOL prepares for launch. ROKN The Gray Eagle STOL used in the trials very clearly carries the U.S. civilian registration N450MV, indicating that it’s the same airframe as the original Mojave demonstrator, modified to the latest standard, or at the very least given a new coat of paint. As GA-ASI puts it, 'Gray Eagle STOL is General Atomics’ name for the production variant of the historic aircraft demonstrator known as Mojave' — but it remains unclear what, if any changes have been made to the actual aircraft in the meantime. The General Atomics Mojave. GA-ASI The Dokdo class appear to provide a suitable platform for exploring operations by fixed-wing drones — and could potentially field them on a permanent or regular basis in the future. The Dokdo class LPH is 652 feet long, 101 feet wide, and has a displacement of 19,500 tons. The Gray Eagle STOL gets aloft from the Dokdo amphibious assault ship in the Sea of Japan. Note the plane guard helicopter airborne to the rear. ROKN As it stands now, the Dokdos are configured to carry a complement of around 10 medium-lift helicopters, such as the ROKN’s UH-60P Black Hawks or Leonardo AW159 Wildcats. In the past, South Korea looked at using the Dokdo class design as a springboard to develop a true fixed-wing capable aircraft carrier that could embark F-35B short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) stealth fighters. More recently, those plans — for the so-called CVX — were dramatically scaled back, with Seoul instead choosing to invest in its increasingly capable submarine fleet. A model of the fixed-wing-capable CVX aircraft carrier design from Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI), displayed at the International Maritime Defense Industry Exhibition 2021. YouTube screencap These changing priorities may well have helped generate interest in fixed-wing drone operations, instead. In the process, GA-ASI is gaining more experience in operating its Gray Eagle STOL and related Mojave from the decks of different warships. Almost exactly a year ago, TWZ reported on the experimental operations involving the Mojave aboard the U.K. Royal Navy’s HMS Prince of Wales, the first time the drone had operated from an aircraft carrier. For its part, the Royal Navy is increasingly looking to harness the capability offered by uncrewed aircraft for its carrier force. A Mojave drone during trials from the deck of HMS Prince of Wales. GA-ASI With a 901-foot-long flight deck, HMS Prince of Wales (and its sister vessel HMS Queen Elizabeth) offers more ‘real estate’ for Gray Eagle STOL operations than the Dokdo class, which has a flight deck length of just under 653 feet. Unlike the Gray Eagle STOL trials on the Dokdo, the Mojave demonstration on HMS Prince of Wales involved a takeoff and a landing. The dimensions of the Dokdo may well put some limits on Gray Eagle STOL’s load-carrying capability. While we don’t have the figures for Gray Eagle STOL, according to GA-ASI, the Mojave has a takeoff run of 1,000 feet when armed with 12 AGM-114 Hellfire air-to-surface missiles. However, when configured for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions, the Mojave’s takeoff distance is reduced to just 400 feet. Provided the figure is broadly the same for Gray Eagle STOL, this would be ample when operating off from the South Korean warship. The addition of an electromagnetic catapult on big deck amphibious assault ships, which is of rising interest with navies around the globe, could potentially allow an aircraft like Gray Eagle STOL to operate at higher gross weights from their decks. When the Mojave was first unveiled, GA-ASI pointed out that its improved short-field performance and rugged landing gear would also make it suitable for carrier-based operations. What’s more, these can be conducted without any need for a catapult to launch the drone or arresting gear during recovery. The same characteristics have now been ported over to the Gray Eagle STOL. At the same time, the Gray Eagle STOL adds new features that were not found on the Mojave, including the various technologies introduced on the improved Gray Eagle 25M. This drone was developed to provide the U.S. Army with the option to procure a more advanced version of the MQ-1C Gray Eagle, with various enhancements specifically designed to meet better the demands of a future conflict with a peer or near-peer state. The Gray Eagle STOL launches from the Dokdo amphibious assault ship in the Sea of Japan. ROKN The new features on the Gray Eagle 25M — now found on the Gray Eagle STOL — include an improved heavy-fuel engine, increased onboard power, significantly reduced maintenance requirements, and an expeditionary laptop-based ground control station. In our previous coverage of the Mojave, we discussed how the drone would be likely suitable for use not only from aircraft carriers like the Queen Elizabeth class but also from large assault ships, also without launch and recovery gear, like the Dokdo class — not to mention the U.S. Navy’s America class landing helicopter assault (LHA) and Wasp class landing helicopter dock (LHD) ships. The same applies to the Gray Eagle STOL. The Mojave demonstrator on the deck of the U.K. Royal Navy’s aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales. Crown Copyright Maritime missions for the Gray Eagle STOL or the Mojave could include overwatch of the amphibious assault task group, including the beachhead, or overwatch during force protection missions in ‘brown water’ or littoral environments. Carrying surveillance equipment, the drones could also expand the reach of the Dokdo class during anti-submarine warfare operations, making good use of the unarmed Mojave’s endurance of between 10 and 12 hours when launched off a carrier-sized landing area with no weapons. Since the Gray Eagle STOL and the Mojave can also be armed, these missions could be extended to persistent armed overwatch, or even strike, including close air support of an amphibious assault, for example. Moreover, having armed drones would bring an entirely new fixed-wing combat capability to the Dokdo class, which currently relies on helicopters to provide extended anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare capabilities.

GA-ASI When operating in ‘blue water’ environments, these types of drones could also prove very valuable as networking and communications relay nodes, as well as acting as electronic warfare platforms, and even for airborne early warning. Overall, a MALE drone offers a set of capabilities that a helicopter simply can’t replicate. With their short range, helicopters cannot maintain a presence for many hours at a time, at extended ranges from the ship, or at the kinds of elevated altitudes that these kinds of drones can. These attributes translate to far superior line-of-sight performance and endurance, which would further free the host warship from relying on land-based assets and provide them with much improved organic capabilities. South Korea’s Yonhap news agency described yesterday’s test as part of wider 'efforts to better integrate and improve operations of manned and unmanned military equipment' within the Republic of Korea Armed Forces. While the plans to fly the Gray Eagle STOL from the Dokdo class landing platform helicopter (LPH) — two of which are in ROKN service — had not previously been publicized, South Korea’s efforts to introduce drones of various classes and types have been significant.

Thomas The Republic of Korea Armed Forces already operates a wide range of drones, ranging in size from Israeli-made Harpy loitering munitions to U.S.-supplied RQ-4B Block 30 Global Hawk high-altitude, long-endurance, remotely piloted aircraft. Locally developed drone programs include the Korean Unmanned System – Fixed-wing Strategic (KUS-FS) medium-altitude, long-endurance drone, broadly similar to the U.S. MQ-9 Reaper, and the Korean Unmanned System – Vertical Helicopter (KUS-VH), an uncrewed armed scout adaptation of the MD500 helicopter, and therefore equivalent to the Unmanned Little Bird developed by Boeing. In the future, South Korea plans to field drones to complement the KF-21 Boramae next-generation combat aircraft, as a means of boosting the potential of the crewed fighter as well as maximizing ‘combat mass.’ You can read more about the concept here. Last year, South Korea showcased a new stealthy-shaped flying wing drone, apparently intended to test technologies that could feed into ‘loyal wingman’ efforts as well as drones for potentially a wide range of other tasks. A rendering of what manufacturer Korean Air is pitching as a 'Stealth UAV Squadron' that includes a flying wing-type UCAV and multiple loyal wingman-type drones. Korean Air So far, however, drone activities by the ROKN have been more limited. Acquisitions have included the popular Schiebel CAMCOPTER S-300 unmanned air system (UAS), a small rotary-wing drone that can operate from the flight decks of even small warships. The Gray Eagle STOL recovers to a land base in Pohang after its historic mission yesterday. ROKN At this stage, we have little idea of Seoul’s ambitions in terms of fixed-wing drone operations from the Dokdo class — or even future amphibious assault ships. Perhaps more importantly, at least in the short term, the trials aboard the Dokdo have further underscored the ability of both the Gray Eagle STOL and the Mojave to operate from ships of this size, something that is likely to be of interest to operators of other aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships, even without launch and recovery gear.

Russia’s Largest Film Studio Donated Antique Tanks To The Militar...	Russia has lost so many tanks in Ukraine that the nation’s largest studio has donated movie props to bolster its armor force. '&#8230;in 2023, we handed over 28 T-55 tanks, 8 PT-76 tanks, 6 infantry fighting vehicles and 8 trucks we had in our military department to the Armed Forces,' Mosfilm Director Gen. Karen Shakhnazarov told Vladimir Putin during a meeting at the Kremlin on Wednesday. 'I knew that they needed them, so I got in touch with the Defense Ministry, and they took these vehicles.' Mosfilm Director General Karen Shakhnazarov (left) met with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin Wednesday. (Kremlin) The tanks and armor were part of a collection of nearly 200 Mosfilm had on hand, the studio states on its website. 'All equipment is a prop (stage-site-site means), is in good condition and is ready to shoot several films at the same time,' Mosfilm explains, adding it 'provides its own sites for filming films with the participation of military equipment, on the territory of the military-technical base itself, as well as in the adjacent forest belt.' Among its armor collection, the studio had T-54/55s and PT-76s. Examples of tanks like those can be seen in the following images. Soviet T-55 tanks in front of Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin on October 28, 1961 HUM Images A Russian PT-76 light amphibious tank. (Alexander Kovalenko) So far, Russia has lost at least 3,549 tanks, according to the Dutch Oryx open-source tracking group. That figure includes 2,484 destroyed: 158 damaged, 374 abandoned, and 533 captured. The total figure is higher because Oryx only tabulates losses for which it has visual confirmation. The studio’s donation at best seems symbolic. The small handful donated to the military represents a little more than 1% of Russian tank losses fighting Ukraine. Moreover, they are very old. The first prototype of the T-54/55s appeared in 1945 while the PT-76 amphibious tanks have been in service since 1952. It is unclear exactly how Russia will use these tanks, but as we previously reported, T-54/55s began appearing on the battlefield last year. As we reported at the time, those tanks were seen - reportedly in southeastern Ukraine - about a month after trainloads of them were spotted on the move in Russia, prompting speculation that they would soon be taking part in the conflict. In March 2023, the Conflict Intelligence Team (СІТ) reported on Telegram that the tanks departed from the city of Arsenyev in the Primorsky Krai, which is home to the 1295th Central Base of Repairs and Storage of Tanks of the Russian Army. You can see those tanks in the video below. The T-54/55s have been used in combat, as we have noted in the past. When the tanks first appeared, we posited that they offered some added protection to their crews, especially against shrapnel from artillery shells and similar threats that are very pronounced on battlefields in Ukraine. Though unsuitable for direct tank-on-tank combat, their 100mm main guns could still be useful for engaging lighter enemy vehicles and fortified strong points, as well as just opposing troops caught in the open. A Russian T-54/55 tank on a train. (Via Twitter screencap) They have also been used as remote-controlled bombs, packed with explosives. It is also possible that Mosfilm's tanks could be used for spare parts or even as decoys. Russia has previously used inflatable tanks designed to confuse Ukrainian forces and get them to waste ammunition. After the Cold War ended, Russia, like the U.S., drew down conventional forces. That included a large number of the more than 80,000 T-54/55s produced. They were placed in storage, mainly in the Far East, since they had already been displaced by more modern tanks in the military districts closer to NATO’s own tank forces. Far fewer of the PT-76s were made, with about 12,000 produced. While able to maneuver well in the water with its wide hull and water jet propulsion, it had some serious deficiencies, like a large silhouette, weak armor protection, and an underpowered 76 mm gun. Russia has replaced them with newer amphibious armor vehicles. Still, the PT-76s were sent into service to fight Ukraine in June 2022, according to a well-known Ukrainian military observer. 'It remained in service with the Russian army until 2010, after which all remaining PT-76s were sent into storage with subsequent, in the future, disposal,' Alexander Kovalenko wrote on Facebook at the time. 'But in 2022, the tank received a second life, after the ‘second’ army in the world decided to start a small victorious war for a week.' However, unlike the T-54/55s, we have seen no videos of large movements of the amphibious light tank to the front or in combat. According to Oryx, none have yet been lost on the battlefield. CIT, however, stated a variant of that tank - the BTR-50 tracked armored personnel carrier - was also pulled from Russian storage in March 2023. They began to emerge on the battlefield that month, we noted at the time. 'We find it difficult to name the possible areas of application of these tanks, but in any case, along with the removal of the BTR-50 from storage and the installation of naval anti-aircraft guns on the MT-LB, this clearly indicates serious problems with providing the Russian Armed Forces with armored vehicles,' CIT suggested at the time. Mosfilm, which has made more than 2,500 full-length films, has won some prestigious awards over the years, including three Oscars. However, its highest praise in Russia may have come today. 'Mosfilm is our pride,' Putin glowed.

Boeing’s Plan For Modernized AH-64 Apaches Serving Into The 2060s	Boeing is busily planning for future upgrades to the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter. While the scope of what is tentatively known as the Modernized Apache has been scaled back somewhat compared to how it once looked, the company is considering the lessons of the war in Ukraine as it seeks to optimize the AH-64 so that it can continue to serve the U.S. Army into the 2060s. Long before that time it will be operating alongside the Army’s Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) tiltrotor, which will bring a whole new set of capabilities — and new challenges — for the Apache. The War Zone spoke exclusively to T.J. Jamison, Boeing’s business development director for the Apache and for the AH-6 Little Bird. Jamison, a retired U.S. Army aviator, commanded an aviation squadron in Iraq and an aviation brigade in Afghanistan, having 72 Apaches under his command at one point in the latter theater. Three U.S. Army AH-64 Apaches fly in a holding pattern at the Red Sands exercise in the CENTCOM area of responsibility, on September 23, 2024. U.S. Army photo by Spc. Dean John Kd De Dios Spc. Dean John Kd De Dios As the largest Apache operator, the U.S. Army’s program of record currently covers 791 of the attack helicopters, with 91 of the older AH-64D Longbow, or 'Delta' models in service right now. Some of the U.S. Army Deltas are still passing through Boeing’s remanufacturing program, from which they emerge as the improved AH-64E Apache Guardian or 'Echo' versions. The size of the U.S. Army’s Apache fleet is determined by the organizational structure, in which there’s an attack battalion and an air cavalry squadron in each combat aviation brigade for each division. This makes it one of the very few customers who, in Jamison’s words, 'can truly fight with the Apache as a maneuver element in an air-ground integration concept, out there on the battlefield.' While this was the Cold War style of combat that the Apache was designed for, in more recent decades the helicopter was employed by the U.S. Army almost exclusively in a counterinsurgency (COIN) concept of operations, in the Middle East and Afghanistan. Now, with the war in Ukraine, the pendulum is swinging back toward something closer to the Cold War model, reflected in growing interest in the Apache in Europe.

Photo by ROMEO GACAD / AFP ROMEO GACAD Returning to the U.S. Army, as Jamison explains, the reason those last 91 Deltas have not yet been upgraded to the definitive standard is that they were previously due to be replaced in air cavalry squadrons by the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA). This was one of the U.S. Army’s highest-profile aviation programs until its cancelation earlier this year. That decision, which we discussed in detail, has an effect on the Apache force but, more critically, makes the AH-64 an even more critical asset for the Army and refocuses efforts to keep it effective and relevant for another four decades or more. 'Now that FARA has gone, the Army’s got to make a decision on what to do with these 91 Deltas,' Jamison says. 'Do they send them back to us to get remanufactured into Echos? What they do with the 91 is their decision.' Apache genesis Before looking at what comes next — and after the AH-64E — it’s worth looking at the evolution of the Apache, and the different drivers that have influenced its continued development since it first flew back in 1975 and after the introduction of the initial AH-64A or Alpha model in 1984. An AH-64A Apache is prepared for a mission during Operation Desert Storm, on February 27, 1991. Photo By U.S. Army/Getty Images U.S. Army 'When this aircraft first came about as an Alpha-model aircraft back in the 1980s, it was specifically designed for large-scale combat operations,' Jamison explains. Under the AirLand Battle doctrine devised in that decade, the AH-64A was intended to fight on the plains of Europe against a high-intensity, near-peer adversary — the massed armored formations of the Warsaw Pact. 'I think a lot of people have kind of forgotten that, because of the incredible success that we observed with this aircraft in the counterinsurgency environment in Iraq and Afghanistan,' Jamison continues. 'But now, as we have transitioned out of that type of warfare and are now focused on large-scale combat operations in the European theater and obviously in the Pacific area of responsibility, people have forgotten that this is what this aircraft was originally designed to do.' It’s very notable that, with the exception of the Apache, each one of the so-called Big Five programs that were central to U.S. Army modernization during the late 1970s and 1980s — the M1 Abrams main battle tank, the UH-60 Black Hawk utility and transport helicopter, the M2 and M3 Bradley fighting vehicles, and the Patriot air defense missile system — have all had a significant impact in the war in Ukraine, entering a European war decades after they were devised, but no less relevant with the passage of time. U.S. Army and Kuwaiti forces move to engage targets during a joint combined arms live-fire exercise near Camp Buehring, Kuwait, December 6-7, 2016. The multi-day exercise involved M1 Abrams tanks, AH-64 Apaches, Bradley fighting vehicles, and more. U.S. Army photo by Sgt. Aaron Ellerman Sgt. Aaron Ellerman After the fielding of the AH-64D in 1997, the crew experience changed radically with the introduction of an all-glass cockpit, but it was the Longbow fire-control radar that made the biggest difference in terms of capability. Now, rapid engagements of multiple targets at once were possible by only exposing the Delta’s mast-mounted radar dish above the tree line or another kind of cover, before popping up to fire a missile. The Delta also brought other significant advances, including the first iteration of manned-unmanned teaming and the Arrowhead, or Modernized Target Acquisition and Designation Sight (M-TADS). Less obvious was the addition of a Link 16 datalink, which was, Jamison admits, 'quite frankly, a little cumbersome.' Adding all this equipment bestowed new capabilities but also meant the airframe was gaining weight. 'In the Delta model, we started to lose that sports-car-like performance that we had with the Alpha, so that drove us to the Echo model, where the big changes are a new drivetrain, a new transmission to allow us to unlock additional horsepower through the T700-701D engines.' The GE Aerospace T700-701D engine. GE Aerospace The AH-64E therefore returned more sprightly performance and because of that boost, more capabilities could be accommodated. The Echo features fully integrated Link 16, for a 'much more seamless, easier-to-use capability' and significant improvements were also made to manned-unmanned teaming. Improvements to the radar saw its range extended from five miles all the way up to 10 miles. The improved radar in the Echo not only allows targets to be engaged at greater distances, but a new advanced air-to-air mode sets the Apache up for kinetic engagements in the counter-unmanned aircraft system (UAS) mission, something that is of increasing importance for the U.S. Army and others, and which Jamison expects will be further expanded upon in future upgrades. 'The other thing we added in [the Echo model] was a maritime mode, where the radar will identify classes of vessels at sea, regardless of sea states,' Jamison explains. Previously, higher waves were a major challenge for the Apache’s radar, and identifying maritime targets is of obvious relevance in the Pacific theater.

U.S. Marine Corps photo by Cpl. Elize McKelvey/Released Cpl. Elize McKelvey Version 6.5 The Echo versions started out with Version 1 and by now Version 4.5 is a common standard among different operators. Meanwhile, Version 6 is coming off the production line today, and Boeing is under contract for V6.5, a configuration that first flew in October of 2023. 'We’re continuing to do testing and flight developments on V6.5. For the customer, it’s going to bring a common configuration of software across the entire fleet,' Jamison says. 'Right now, if you go from one aviation brigade in the U.S. Army, let’s say at Fort Campbell, and then you go to Fort Novosel, or Joint Base Lewis–McChord, there’s a good chance that you’re going to have a different version of the Echo models, and you’ll have to do some transition training.' A stock photo of an AH-64E, here with the V6 configuration. U.S. Army photo V6.5 will simplify the U.S. Army’s Apache fleet and give them some new capabilities, mostly at the software level. Jamison highlights one of the biggest advantages of the new software and one that should play a big part in the Apache’s future development path, namely setting the helicopter up for the future integration of the General Electric T901 turboshaft engine developed under the Improved Turbine Engine Program (ITEP). 'We’ve incorporated future growth into the V6.5 to integrate capabilities that, heck, we may not even know about right now, that are still out there in the development stage,' Jamison says. 'By having an open systems architecture, just like with your iPhone, we can get software updates fully integrated. When you have to integrate something like Link 16 or whatever that next capability will be, you don’t have to send it back to the factory. We don’t have to go in there and do significant software upgrades.' Jamison described a recent Boeing demonstration, where a third party brought in a radio that had never been put into an Apache and installed it, while the Boeing engineers stood back and watched their ‘plug and play’ integration of that radio. 'That may sound simple, but it really is not. It’s really a lot more technical than you would think, but they were able to do that without any Boeing assistance,' Jamison recalls. 'So that’s where we’re headed because that sets us up for future growth into the next-generation Apache.' As to what that next-generation Apache looks like, that’s still somewhat unclear, but Boeing expects the U.S. Army will want to keep flying the attack helicopter into the 2060s timeframe. That will involve a lot of potential changes to the helicopter, which is why the open architecture is now being prioritized, allowing simpler and more cost-effective integration of future capabilities. Boeing Advanced flight controls Another area of future development is advanced flight controls, in the form of the Active Parallel Actuation System (APAS). Jamison explains: 'This is a system where we’re doing everything we can to reduce the pilot workload in the cockpit as these new capabilities come on board, particularly with counter-UAS lessons learned from Ukraine, bringing in more Link 16, Launched Effects, and other things that we don’t even know about yet,' Jamison says. 'Five, 10, or 15 years down the road, we know we have the potential to overwhelm the crew, so we’re doing things to reduce pilot workload, and one of those is the advanced flight controls.' As far as the pilot is concerned, the advanced flight controls add soft stops to the controls, as Jamison explains. 'Imagine, as you’re pulling in power, and you’re about to reach a power limit, a torque limit if you had a soft stop built into those controls where you felt it, a physical and tactile feel where you had to pull through that, versus getting your head in the cockpit looking at a gauge instead of looking outside where the threat is. That’s the whole concept behind the advanced flight controls.' Launched Effects Launched Effects are a growing area of interest for the U.S. Army, especially. At one point, the service described a future family of Air-Launched Effects (ALE), small uncrewed aerial systems that could be adapted for a range of missions, not only limited to standoff attack, but also including surveillance, electronic warfare, communications relay, and serving as decoys. The Army now refers to these simply as Launched Effects, reflecting the fact that some are likely to be deployed from dismounted launchers on the ground or from vehicles, as well as from aircraft. Boeing concept artwork showing Modernized Apaches deploying Launched Effects in the form of small drones. Boeing Boeing New helmet display Among the pilot aids that Boeing is now working on is a follow-on to the current Integrated Helmet And Display Sight System (IHADSS), which is basically the monocle imaging system that goes over one eye. For its time, IHADSS was state of the art, but with the right eye looking at imaging that’s presented on the monocle and the left eye looking inside the cockpit or outside, it was something that some pilots struggled with in the past, Jamison says. This is a well-known and challenging aspect of fighting in the Apache that was even made into a plot point in the Apache-centric Nick Cage action movie Firebirds. Rapid developments in augmented reality and helmet-mounted sights over the past two decades, including the ability to display more information to the pilot, are likely to be key to achieving these improvements.

Devin Klecan 'It worked really well, for the technology that we had at the time, but now there are new technologies that will allow us to put all of that data on a visor-type environment, kind of like what an F-35 does right now, and so we don’t have just that single piece of an IHADSS. This will make it a much more lethal, seamless capability going forward.' Other changes in the cockpit are being heralded by the advanced crew station, which includes a large touch screen, instead of the previous multiple multifunctional displays. Boeing is also looking at refining the seating arrangement with the aim of making it more comfortable for missions that might last as long as 10 hours. Propulsion systems The more powerful ITEP engine is very much seen as underpinning the future of the Apache. 'The ability to bring ITEP into the Apache and get a full 3,850 horsepower into that aircraft, that sets you up for room for growth, extended range, reach, and payloads.' The first GE Aerospace T901 flight test engine, which was designated for Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) competitive prototypes. GE Aerospace Program Executive Office, Aviati Boeing received a developmental contract for the integration of ITEP into the Apache, but the U.S. Army has, for now, made the decision to prioritize putting the new engine into the Black Hawk. 'There has not been a decision to not put ITEP into the Apache, so we are still working to our customer’s desires and we’re using some of our own funds to continue the design work to get ITEP into the Apache,' Jamison says. 'We really firmly believe that you’re going to need that 3,850 horsepower to incorporate some of these additional capabilities.' Ahead of ITEP, Boeing is working on other improvements to the Apache’s propulsion system, with the Improved Tail Rotor Blade (ITRB) and Improved Tail Rotor Drive System (ITRDS). Boeing is currently under a developmental contract for ITRB, which is primarily focused on sustainment, ensuring the tail rotor blades can be more easily repaired and maintained, including on the battlefield. Meanwhile, ITRDS ensures that more power and authority are delivered to the tail rotor and is seen as something that will pave the way toward ITEP. What will the next Apache look like? Boeing is increasingly focused on what comes after the AH-64E Version 6.5, whatever that might be called. Jamison uses the name Modernized Apache but also references the New-Generation Apache. Importantly, while the next AH-64 might be a new iteration of the Echo, it could be something more radically different. Earlier Boeing concept artwork showing a possible future Apache, including increased-area stub wings. Boeing While its name and final appearance are yet to be determined, this future Apache 'is still a very, very active pursuit of ours,' Jamison confirms. Boeing is working with the U.S. Army and the Futures Command on some of the aforementioned lines of effort that will lead to a Modernized Apache, with some of those efforts, or portions of them, under contract with the Army and some being funded using the company’s dollars. Boeing sees a need for a Modernized Apache capability in the 2032 to 2035 timeframe and, to achieve that is looking at the option of a remanufacturing program, like that which turns older AH-64Ds into new AH-64E versions. As Jamison explains, 'Our concept, as we go from Echo to Modernized Apache, will be along much the same lines. We believe they will need a new fuselage because fuselages have a lifespan because of the rigors that they go through. We know they will need more power for that growth aspect. So we’re really focused on those lines of effort for that next-generation Apache, whatever it’s going to be called.' An artist’s concept of a Modernized Apache in an Indo-Pacific scenario. Boeing The result should give the U.S. Army not only a zero-time, new-fuselage helicopter but also one that has greater 'real estate' onto which new capabilities can be attached. In many ways, the current vision involves a less dramatic makeover than the kind Boeing had suggested in the past. For example, the articulated tail rotor, which could articulate 90 degrees to provide forward thrust during level flight, 'is not in our plans right now,' according to Jamison. A chart from a 2014 Boeing presentation showing an artist’s conception of the then-proposed compound Apache design, including an articulated tail rotor. Boeing While an articulated tail rotor promised a major boost in performance, Boeing now thinks that cleaning up the fuselage from an aerodynamic perspective and increasing the power through ITEP, will provide the required speeds, although Jamison admits the end result likely won’t be as fast as with an articulated tail rotor. The combination of aerodynamic refinements and uprated engines also promises to increase range and payload. Retractable landing gear is another performance-enhancing option that Boeing eyed in the past, but which has been dropped for the time being, the company considering it not worth the effort considering the weight and complexity that it brings. Jamison did say that Boeing is looking at moving the radar from its mast-mounted position, as a potential aerodynamic improvement, something that doesn’t appear to have been shown in concept artwork so far. The mast-mounted AN/APG-78 Longbow fire-control radar. Northrop Grumman 'We’ve got that large piece of flat-plate drag sitting up above the rotor system. At the time we put it up there for a very specific reason, so you could just stick that thing above an obstacle and hide the rest of the aircraft. With some of the new technologies that we have, particularly with Launched Effects and with fully integrated Link 16, it’s allowing us to fight and engage from much greater ranges. Having it above the rotor system is not quite as critical.' Instead, Boeing wants to integrate the radar into the fuselage, cleaning up a lot of the aerodynamics of the Apache, especially when combined with other aerodynamic modifications. One way of installing a radar internally could be to use a conformal AESA arrays, a technology that is getting ever smaller and more versatile. As Jamison points out, Launched Effects and Link 16 — relying more on third-party sensor platforms and their networked data overall — also reduces the need for any radar in many circumstances, providing another route to gaining targeting data and then prosecuting targets, including at standoff ranges. Lessons from Ukraine As to how the war in Ukraine is affecting thinking about the future Apache, Jamison noted the value in understanding how things have evolved in that conflict, but urged caution on jumping to blanket conclusions.

'And I’m not saying we discount those lessons. We must watch those and pay attention to them, but we’ve got to put them in the proper context. And what I mean by that is you’re looking at two militaries that are not at the same level of sophistication and modernization as NATO’s forces — particularly the Ukrainian side.' Of the lessons that are coming out of Ukraine, Boeing is 'really, really focused on how to counter some of the threats that we’re seeing right now, particularly the counter-UAS capability.' With that in mind, Jamison sees both kinetic and non-kinetic (electronic warfare) counter-UAS solutions as integral to the Apache’s future development path. While these capabilities might not yet be mature, work on bringing open architecture systems to the V6.5 aircraft will ensure that they can accommodate them in the future. . @USArmy Soldiers engage an unmanned aerial system (UAS) from an AH-64 with upgraded Hellfire missile during Red Sands training exercise in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. @usarmycentral pic.twitter.com/HG9ChuWxt6&mdash; U.S. Central Command (@CENTCOM) September 30, 2024 'Think about it, five years ago, was anybody talking about lethal, low-cost drones that are literally flying down Ukrainian or Russian trenches, and chasing individual soldiers? Nobody was thinking about that, so that’s why the open system architecture is so critically important. People will say they know what’s coming next, but have we ever predicted the way a future conflict was actually going to play out? I think everybody’s track record is pretty poor in that regard.' Apache meets FLRAA Change of a different kind is also coming to the U.S. Army with the FLRAA tiltrotor, which promises to herald a revolution in air assault operations, with a whole new set of speed, range, and survivability metrics. With that in mind, and with FARA canceled, questions might be asked about how the Apache — or future versions of it — might keep pace with FLRAA’s capabilities and the obvious difference in speed. An artist’s concept of the Army’s Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) tiltrotor. Bell When asked about this, Jamison suggested that viewing the Apache as a simple escort to FLRAA — in the mode of a P-51 fighter to a B-17 bomber — is 'a very old-school way of thinking that doesn’t really apply to the modern battlefield.' Instead, the Apache will fight according to its point of impact on the battlefield, the place where it will make a difference, whether that’s in direct support of a brigade combat team on the ground, being utilized as a battalion maneuver element, or conducting deep strike operations into enemy territory. Aided by Link 16, Launched Effects, and other capabilities, the Apache will exploit its ability to reach deep into the battlefield in support of FLRAA, rather than being a physical presence right next to the fast-flying tiltrotor. AH-64D Apaches assigned to the 1st Battalion, 3rd Aviation Regiment, 12th Combat Aviation Brigade land at the Katterbach Army Airfield, Germany, on May 20, 2022, after spending roughly three months in the Baltic region while participating in Exercise Saber Strike 22. U.S. Army photo by Staff Sgt. Thomas Mort Jamison outlines one scenario in which Apaches are already in the fight, on station, and creating the conditions on the battlefield that will allow FLRAA to quickly ingress or egress. In this way, the attack helicopters ensure that additional capabilities — whether artillery or an anti-tank squad team — can join the fight, by reducing the level of threat against FLRAA as it ingresses in, and egresses out. There remain, however, legitimate questions about how the Apache should be able to reach the areas where it can have an impact, bearing in mind the extended distances at which FLRAA should operate and, once there, whether it would be able to survive in the face of the kinds of advanced air defense systems that a peer adversary can bring to bear. These concerns are only magnified in the Pacific theater, in a potential future conflict with China, where the 'tyranny of distance' is compounded by high-end anti-aircraft threats. With the Apache's combat radius defined as a couple hundred miles or so depending on the loadout and mission profile, its relevance in such a conflict is in question. Using forward arming and refueling points can help with getting the Apaches where they need to fight and back again, but those too can be vulnerable to rapid enemy attack. A U.S. Army AH-64 during shipborne maneuvers in the Pacific. U.S. Army www.twz.com While there are a variety of different takeaways from the conflict, the war in Ukraine has certainly raised questions over the future role of the attack helicopter and, amid budgetary constraints, it’s conceivable that the AH-64 fleet — which already consumes a huge portion of the Army budget for rotary aviation — might be vulnerable, if the conclusion is that its previous relevance has been eroded. Nevertheless, with FARA out of the picture and the U.S. Army aiming to operate Apaches of one kind or another for decades to come, Boeing is understandably confident about the future of the attack helicopter — and that’s before even taking into account international customers. Further sales to Israel and South Korea look increasingly likely and even Canada is assessing a future attack helicopter purchase. Meanwhile, Boeing continues to refine its now-classic design in a variety of ways. While the latest vision of the Modernized Apache is somewhat less ambitious than previous concepts suggested, it will be fascinating to see what route its development takes next.

F-35C Naval Joint Strike Fighters Fly Combat Missions Against Hou...	U.S. Marine Corps F-35C Joint Strike Fighters flying from the deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln took part in recent operations against Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen, the Pentagon has disclosed. This appears to be one of the first combat outings, if not the first, for carrier-based C variants of the F-35 belonging to either the Marines or the U.S. Navy. 'U.S. Central Command [CENTCOM] forces executed a series of precise airstrikes [on] November 9 through 10 on multiple Houthi weapons storage facilities situated within Houthi-controlled territories in Yemen,' Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder said at a routine press briefing today. 'These facilities housed a variety of advanced conventional weapons used by the Iran-backed Houthis to target US and international military and civilian vessels navigating international waters in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.' 'The operation involved U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy assets, to include F-35C fighter aircraft,' Ryder added. A US Marine Corps F-35C launches from the USS Abraham Lincoln in August 2024. USN 'DOD: U.S. Navy F-35Cs make combat debut along with USAF aircraft in series of targeted operations Nov. 9-10 on Houthi targets in Yemen,' Brian Everstine, Aviation Week's Pentagon editor subsequently wrote in a post on X. Maj. Gen. Ryder appears to have misspoken about the F-35Cs in question belonging to the Navy, as did Everstine (who later corrected himself). A video CENTCOM released today, seen below, shows F-35Cs, as well as an F/A-18F Super Hornet fighter and an EA-18G Growler electronic warfare aircraft, taking off from the supercarrier USS Abraham Lincoln as part of the November 9-10 strikes against the Houthis. The only F-35C unit aboard Lincoln currently is Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 314 (VMFA-314), the 'Black Knights.'

Gen. Ryder did not explicitly say that this was the first time F-35Cs had been employed in combat. It is possible that this is just the first time Marine C models have flown combat sorties. VMFA-314 may have flown combat missions in the region before now, as well. Lincoln first arrived in the CENTCOM area of responsibility back in August. What munitions the F-35Cs employed during their sorites against the Houthis over the weekend is also unknown, but the jets in the CENTCOM video do not appear to be carrying any weapons externally. F-35Cs can currently carry 1,000 and 2,000-pound class Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) GPS-assisted precision-guided bombs, 500-pound class Paveway-series laser-guided bombs, and AGM-154 Joint Stand-Off Weapon (JSOW) precision glide-bombs, as well as AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM), internally The War Zone has reached out to the Pentagon, CENTCOM, the Navy, and the Marines for more information. VMFA-314 F-35Cs on the deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln in May 2024. USN Regardless, F-35Cs are now clearly being employed in combat. This follows the combat debut of U.S. F-35Bs (also flown by the Marines) in 2018 against targets in Afghanistan and of U.S. Air Force F-35As in strikes on targets in Iraq the next year. In 2018, Israeli F-35I Adirs had also become the first Joint Strike Fighters operated by any country to see combat. British F-35Bs are the only other Joint Strikes Fighters known to have flown combat missions. The F-35C, which the U.S. military is currently the only operator of, was also the last Joint Strike Fighter variant to reach the initial operational capability milestone (in 2019) and only began deploying on Navy carriers in 2021. VMFA-314 was actually the first Marine F-35C squadron to deploy on a carrier, wrapping up its initial deployment aboard the Abraham Lincoln the following year. A VMFA-314 F-35C prepares to launch from the USS Abraham Lincoln in 2021. USN U.S. military operations in and around the Red Sea against the Houthis have already produced a number of naval aviation firsts and, unfortunately, the crisis shows no signs of abating. Following the strikes by the F-35Cs and other aircraft over the weekend, the Houthis launched a barrage of anti-ship ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as kamikaze drones, against two Arleigh Burke class destroyers assigned to the USS Abraham Lincoln's strike group. 'On November 11, U.S. Central Command forces successfully repelled multiple Iranian-backed Houthi attacks during the transit of the Bab al-Mandab Strait. During the transit, the Arleigh Burke class guided missile destroyer[s] USS Stockdale and USS Spruance were attacked by at least eight one-way attack uncrewed aerial systems, five anti-ship ballistic missiles, and three anti-ship cruise missiles, which were successfully engaged and defeated,' Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder said at his briefing today. 'The vessels were not damaged. No personnel were hurt. &#8230; To the best of my knowledge, I'm not aware of any attacks against the Abraham Lincoln.' VMFA-314's F-35Cs, as well as the rest of the Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group, look set to continue being engaged against the Houthis.

Ukraine Will Have Received 600 French Hammer Bombs By End Of Year	France will have delivered a total of 600 AASM-250 Hammer rocket-assisted bombs to Ukraine by the end of the year, according to the French National Assembly Defense Committee. The Hammers will have come from existing, aging stocks, and plans are in the works to quickly produce more. 'The production of AASM bombs must be significantly accelerated in order to renew the [French] stocks with new munitions,' the committee stated. 'The Ministry of the Armed Forces now aims to produce 1,200 by 2025.' In January, we wrote that France would send Ukraine 50 Hammers per month. The baseline 500-pound-class version has a stand-off range of up to around 43 miles (70 kilometers), similar to that of Ukraine’s U.S.-supplied winged Joint Direct Attack Munition-Extended Range bombs, or JDAM-ERs The Hammer bombs have been used by Ukraine to great effect. In August, we had our best look yet one of the country’s MiG-29 Fulcrum fighters employing these precision-guided munitions. A video released at the time, shot from inside the jet’s cockpit, showed the pilot utilizing a low-level toss bomb technique, which is one mode in which the rocket-boosted munitions were designed to be used. Ukrainian Air Force spokesman Col. Yuri Ignat posted the footage, seen below, which shows the release of two Hammers, on social media earlier today. Ignat said he did so earlier than planned as a tribute to Oleksandr Myhulia, the Ukrainian pilot who shot the video and who was killed while flying a combat mission on August 12. Ukraine is also using Su-25 Frogfoot ground-attack aircraft as Hammer bomb trucks.

Faced with pressure, largely over a weak economy, Chancellor Olaf Scholz called for a snap election on Feb. 23. A leading challenger for that job issued an ultimatum to Russian President Vladimir Putin that his forces should end the fight in 24 hours or he would push to provide air-launched Taurus KEPD 350 cruise missiles to Ukraine. That's a 180-degree change from Scholz's position. 'Scholz absolutely refuses to deliver the Taurus missiles, even though a majority in the Bundestag sees it differently,' said Friedrich Merz, leader of the Christian Democratic Union. 'I am open to it and have suggested giving the government in Kyiv the right to say: If the bombing of civilians does not stop within 24 hours, the range restrictions on the available weapons will be jointly lifted. If that’s not enough, the Taurus missiles will be delivered a week later. This would allow Ukraine to regain the initiative.' The Taurus missile, which offers broadly similar capabilities to the British Storm Shadow and French SCALP-EG, reportedly has a range of more than 300 miles. Ukraine has been seeking it as another weapon to strike deep behind Russian lines. Germany recently announced plans to acquire a new variant of that missile, which you can read more about here. Giving Ukraine Taurus missiles and lifting restrictions on the use of weapons deep inside Russia would provide Kyiv with a much-needed boost in its long-range strike capacity. Germany's snap election comes a day ahead of the third anniversary of the full-on invasion of Ukraine. A Merz victory might be a hopeful sign for Kyiv. If I become chancellor of Germany, I will give Putin an ultimatum regarding Ukraine, — Friedrich Merz If this is not done within 24 hours, he is ready to supply Ukraine with Taurus missiles and give permission to strike the territory of Russia. pic.twitter.com/6jXx0fle22&mdash; MAKS 24 (@Maks_NAFO_FELLA) November 11, 2024 The Latest On the battlefield, Russia's massive Kursk counteroffensive is so far making little headway, the Pentagon’s top spokesman told The War Zone on Tuesday. The Russians have been making 'incremental gains' in Kursk 'with the Ukrainians largely holding a line,' said Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder during a press briefing in response to our question. In Ukraine, meanwhile, the Russians continue to gain territory, especially in the east near Kurakhove in Donetsk Oblast. There are also rumblings by Russian milbloggers of a potentially large-scale attack in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. 'In recent days, more and more data has been coming in about the activation of Russian troops in different sections of the key front - Zaporizhzhya,' the Russian Operation Z Telegram channel claimed. 'This is approximately 125 kilometers wide from the Kakhovka Reservoir in the west to the Vremyevsk salient (Velyka Novosyolka area) in the east. The Russian army is attacking in several directions at once.' Here are some key takeaways from the Institute for the Study of War's (ISW) latest assessment: Ukrainian forces recently advanced in Kursk Oblast. Russian forces are successfully leveraging their recent seizure of Vuhledar to make tactically significant gains south of Kurakhove in support of ongoing Russian offensive operations that aim to level the frontline and eliminate the Ukrainian salient in western Donetsk Oblast. ISW is revising its previous assessment that Russian forces would not likely be able to take advantage of the seizure of Vuhledar for further offensive operations in western Donetsk Oblast. That assessment was incorrect. Russian forces reportedly continue to advance in the Donetsk-Zaporizhia Oblast border area, and Russian advances northwest of Vuhledar and south of Velyka Novosilka may begin to pressure Ukrainian positions in Velyka Novosilka. Russian forces have advanced in western Donetsk Oblast at a moderate tempo, but Russian forces remain highly unlikely to be able to conduct rapid mechanized maneuver that could successfully encircle Ukrainian forces. Ukrainian and Russian sources stated on November 11 that damage to a dam of the Kurakhivske Reservoir is causing limited flooding in nearby settlements. Ukrainian and Russian sources disagreed about who was responsible for damaging the dam, but Russian forces reportedly struck the dam in September 2024. Russian forces may have struck the dam in order to cause significant, long-lasting flooding west of Kurakhivske Reservoir that could facilitate Russian efforts to envelop Ukrainian forces north and south of Kurakhove.

While we have seen this before, we have not seen the associated hardware. An astute observer named Matt Fowler stated on Twitter that one of the images of the drone shows it contained a CORAL AI dev board capable of 'performing 4 trillion operations (tera-operations) per second (TOPS),' the company claims. Having artificial intelligence acquire a target and then guide an FPV drone in its terminal phase would provide a tremendous advantage in launching and completing attacks, something we first examined back in March when this technology appeared to be used by Ukraine.

They reportedly use AI terminal guidance, which would autonomously guide the nets onto FPV drones locked onto by the controller, greatly improving its ability to complete the attack. A video released by Russians shows the net-launching drone hunting down the FPV drone and firing a net that smothers it, causing it to crash to the ground. The U.S. Army is also looking into the use of net-firing drones and recently observed a demonstration of one such system at the Falcon Peak 2025 drone experiment at Fort Carson, Colorado.

Now Russia is working on using strobe lighting on their fixed-wing reconnaissance drones in hopes of temporarily blinding the video feeds of Ukrainian FPV drone hunting drones. That is designed to cause the operator to see mostly blank screens as the camera tries to adjust to the massive changes in exposure from the flashing light.

The Shaheds are programmed to avoid these obstacles based on the carefully planned routes that are uploaded prior to launch and that they fly on autopilot to their final destination. The routes take into account many factors, from avoiding known air defense threats to weather to coordination with other Shaheds and decoys drones, as well as the availability of electronic warfare support to cover some portions of their flights.

China’s New W5000 Cargo Drone Is The Biggest Yet	China’s development of uncrewed cargo aircraft continues apace, with the ongoing Airshow China including the first public appearance of the W5000, the biggest that we’ve seen so far, as well as a full-size mockup of one that can also operate from water, as well as a new concept for an air-launched cargo drone. China now has a multitude of cargo drones in development or under flight test, and beyond their clear civilian applications, their potential utility for helping maintain military logistics networks is very clear. The various cargo drones were displayed at Airshow China, also known as the China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition, in Zhuhai. The event officially opened today and runs until November 17. The big W5000 is from the Air White Whale company. This uncrewed cargo aircraft was unveiled last month when the first example rolled off the production line in the eastern Chinese city of Changzhou. A real example of the drone is part of the static display at Airshow China. The W5000, billed as the world's largest unmanned cargo plane, is shown at the 15th China International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition in Zhuhai, China, on November 12, 2024.

Photo by Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images CFOTO The W5000 is named for its payload of 5,000 kilograms — 11,023 pounds — and is said to have a maximum range of 2,600 kilometers (1,616 miles), with a cruising speed of up to 526 km/h (284 knots). The maximum takeoff weight of the drone is 10,800 kilograms (23,810 pounds). In comparison, the Xi’an Y-7 — a Chinese-produced version of the Soviet-era An-26 twin turboprop — still the main mid-size tactical transport used in China, has a payload of 5,500 kilograms (12,125 pounds). Reportedly, the high-wing, twin-engine W5000 is powered by AEP-100 turboprops produced by the Aero Engine Corporation of China. The rear loading ramp of the W5000.

Photo by Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images CFOTO According to Air White Whale, the W5000 is compatible with standard cargo pallets, which can be loaded and unloaded via a rear ramp and clamshell-type doors in the rear fuselage. The drone is designed to be able to use smaller general aviation airports as well as commercial aviation airports. The ground control system for the W5000 is said to allow a single operator to monitor up to five of the drones simultaneously. When announced, Air White Whale said it had submitted certification documents for the W5000 to Chinese regulators and expected to deliver the first aircraft in the second half of 2026.

However, the W5000 would appear to have obvious military applications, too. TWZ has already looked in detail at a similar Chinese uncrewed cargo aircraft, from the Tengen company, another high-wing, twin-engine design, but with a payload capacity of around 2,000 kilograms (4,410 pounds). The Tengen cargo drone with a payload of 2,000 kilograms that was first flown earlier this year. CCTV via China Daily Making its public debut at Airshow China, after having been announced last week, the CH-YH1000 uncrewed cargo aircraft has been developed by the state-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC).

The CH-YH1000 can accommodate different types of standard cargo pallets, which can be loaded and unloaded via the visor-type upward-opening nose door and via a rear ramp. Interestingly, the CH-YH1000 is already being pitched directly to the military, as well as commercial and other government operators. CASC’s promotional video shows versions of the drone being used for airdropping cargo loads, as well as dropping precision-guided munitions against a land target from a weapons bay in the lower fuselage. Most intriguingly, as well as having the option of tricycle landing gear to take off and land from traditional runaways, the CH-YH1000 can also be adapted for operations from water, taking off and landing using a pair of pontoon-type floats that are attached to either side of the lower fuselage. As well as cargo operations from water, this option also means the CH-YH1000 is being pitched for specific maritime operations including search and rescue, reconnaissance, and anti-submarine warfare. Still, operating a drone like this from a variable operating surface like water would pose some real challenges. As noted earlier, these are also not the first Chinese uncrewed cargo aircraft to have emerged in recent years. The state-run Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) has developed the HH-100 cargo drone, with a stated payload capacity of around 700 kilograms (some 1,543 pounds). The Tengen company, too, has flown another cargo drone, the TB-001D Scorpion D, which began to be tested in 2022, as you can read about here. This is a four-turboprop design with a stated payload capacity of 1,500 kilograms (3,307 pounds). The Tengen TB-001D Scorpion D on display during Airshow China 2024 on November 12, 2024. Photo by Jiang Jurong/VCG via Getty Images VCG Other Chinese firms have been working on larger cargo-carrying drone designs, as well. All this activity is perhaps not surprising considering the lead taken by Chinese companies in conducting uncrewed commercial cargo flights, including using Feihong-98 (FH-98) drones, a biplane design based on the Yun-5B, itself a Chinese copy of the famous Soviet-era Antonov An-2. Although China is busy building traditional cargo aircraft, spearheaded by the increasingly capable Y-20 family, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has a clear requirement for moving supplies in and out of a growing number of remote and austere locations, often with limited runway capacity. Chief among these are the highly strategic island outposts cropping up across the South China Sea. A Chinese Y-20 transport. via Chinese Internet www.twz.com It’s easy to imagine how uncrewed platforms could be ideal for routine resupply operations into such locations, not all of which might even be able to accept crewed cargo aircraft, or which might not be able to do so safely or efficiently. Outside of the South China Sea, there are plenty of other applications for PLA cargo drones, including some of the remote facilities on land in Western China, where the Chinese military presence is expanding and existing infrastructure is very often spartan. At the same time, the high altitudes involved in this region can be a challenge for some traditional transport aircraft. As we have discussed before, the PLA has a clear interest in further developing its capability to conduct expeditionary operations further and further from the Chinese mainland. Bearing in mind the kinds of challenges that any armed forces would face in an active conflict or other high-risk scenario in the Pacific theater, the option of having a fleet of cargo drones to help maintain logistics here would surely be attractive to the PLA. In particular, drones would be preferable for flying supplies into particularly hazardous locales, without having to expose the crew of a cargo plane to additional risk. Similar thinking is also evident in the U.S. military now, in particular the U.S. Marine Corps, which is also increasingly looking to introduce multiple tiers of cargo-carrying uncrewed aerial systems to help support future expeditionary and distributed operations. Once again, the demands of the Pacific theater are very much a driver here. So far, however, the kinds of cargo drones being eyed by the U.S. military are smaller and shorter-ranged than many of the designs now coming out of China. A rendering of the UH-72 Unmanned Logistics Connector — a cargo drone helicopter being offered to the U.S. Marine Corps. Airbus Overall, the U.S. military seems to be facing a growing airlift problem, especially in view of a potential confrontation with China in the Pacific. While there has been talk of uncrewed transport platforms, most concepts so far have focused on optionally crewed solutions. This is less satisfactory bearing in mind the much greater scale of the logistical challenge facing the United States compared with China when fighting in the Indo-Pacific region. Meanwhile, existing U.S. airlifters and tankers are increasingly being eyed for new roles on top of their basic transport tasks. Speaking last month, Brig. Gen. Shane Upton, the director of the U.S. Army’s Contested Logistics Cross-Functional Team, reflected upon the scale of the challenge for the U.S. military. He told Breaking Defense: 'We’re going to have to figure out how to resupply dispersed formations.' 'The Pacific, by nature, drives you to that. There’s no other option if you start putting a Multi-Domain Task Force lethal firing asset on a remote island chain, I have to resupply them with ammo and we may not be able to fly a traditional C-17 or C-130 in there,' Upton added. 'The enemy will be like: ‘You’re not using that port because I just shot it up and it’s gone.’' Finally, another type of cargo drone being shown at Zhuhai is CASC’s CH-103 (or Caihong-103, meaning Rainbow-103), described as a precision airdrop system and similar in concept to uncrewed cargo gliders that have been developed in the United States.

The range of the cargo glider was not stated and it’s unclear which transport aircraft it’s intended to be deployed from. The guidance system is also unclear, but some kind of inertial navigation system seems most likely at this point. This year’s Airshow China has already brought its fair share of surprises, but the prominent place taken by uncrewed cargo aircraft designs—including newly developed ones—demonstrates just how much importance is being assigned to this sector. For the most part, this growing number of ever-larger and more capable cargo drones is being offered primarily for commercial applications. At the same time, however, the military value of these drones in terms of aerial logistics capabilities is unquestionable.

KC-135 Tanker With Artificial Intelligence Copilot Set To Fly Nex...	An operational U.S. Air Force KC-135 tanker equipped with an artificial intelligence (AI) driven 'copilot' from autonomous flight technology company Merlin is set to take to the skies next year. The forthcoming flight testing is an important new step down a path that could lead to pilot-optional KC-135s. This also comes at a time of growing uncertainty around the Air Force's future aerial refueling plans amid serious broader concerns about how the service expects to pay for various top-priority modernization efforts. Merlin announced today that the Air Force has approved its airworthiness plan for the KC-135 fitted with its autonomy package. The company also hopes to have wrapped up the integration of what it calls the Merlin Pilot onto the tanker, as well as ground testing, by the end of the year. 'It's not going to be a test asset. It's not going to be sort of an X-plane that is out at Edwards,' Merlin founder and CEO Matt George said, referring to Edwards Air Force Base, the Air Force's top test and evaluation hubs, in an interview with The War Zone last week. 'It's going to be a real operational Air Force aircraft.' A stock picture of a US Air Force KC-135. USAF A US Air Force KC-135 tanker. USAF 'So, the fact that the Air Force has gotten comfortable and has worked with us over the past three years to get to the point of an approved airworthiness plan where we can actually implement autonomy, not just in the experimental test range world, but on the operational fleet, sounds like sort of a process thing,' George continued. 'But [it] is actually like a pretty big moment for the Air Force on taking autonomy from experimentation land and being able to start to transition that autonomy into the core force.' Merlin was founded in 2018 and has already been flight-testing its autonomy package on other smaller aircraft types, including a Cessna Caravan. Overall, the company says it has been and remains focused on an incremental approach to adding autonomous capabilities and building trust in them, focusing first on capabilities that can help reduce the workload for human aircrews. 'So the Air Force has a particular need around the tanker ecosystem, especially now that the KC 135 will be in service for the next 30 years. So a big, big portion of what General [John] Lamontagne, who is the new [Air Force] Air Mobility Command [AMC] commander, has talked about, is being able to go modernize the fleet and be able to fight with what we have versus fight with what we wish we had,' Merlin's George explained. 'So a real focus on 'how do we use today's fleet to be able to go serve, you know, tomorrow's conflicts?'' The Air Force expects to have 349 KC-135s in service by the end of Fiscal Year 2025. It's worth highlighting here that these are some of the oldest aircraft in the service's inventory and are now set to be its first operational aircraft to get a capability like the Merlin Pilot. 'For the KC-135, there's two use cases that the aircraft that the Air Force is interested in [regarding autonomy]. The first is, 'how do we use autonomy to extend the crew duty day?' So, for instance, how &#8230; could we make it possible to fly a KC-135 for 30 or 40 hours with two crew aboard. Clearly, that's not possible in an unaugmented crew [arrangement]. So can we use autonomy to be able to go back those folks up so that one crew member could be resting while the other is flying, sitting next to the autonomy system, who's acting as sort of that second pilot aboard the flight deck.' AMC has already been experimenting for some time now with operating tankers, and not just KC-135s, with skeleton crews. While doing so could offer a way to increase sortie rates and overall operational capacity, which would be especially critical in any future high-end fight, such as one in the Pacific against China, it also raises safety concerns, as The War Zone has explored in detail in the past. AI-driven 'copilots' have long been presented, in part, as a valuable tool for increasing safety margins, including by reducing task saturation and general operator fatigue, in otherwise crewed aircraft. .S.

(U.S. Air Force photo by Tech. Sgt. Heather Clements) 'So, being super-specific about the KC-135 CONOP [concept of operations], at least in the initial version, here, is the autonomy system is the pilot flying. So the autonomy system is going from takeoff to touchdown, being able to go, follow a mission plan,' George said. 'And that isn't necessarily just waypoints, but follow[ing] objectives of a mission plan, fly the airplane, do things like talk to air traffic control, be able to go manage certain sets of emergencies, do things like route around weather – which is an important part of what our tanker crews do day in and day out – to be able to execute their mission while, you know, being aware of weather and terrain and other things &#8230; like respond to, you know, other aircraft that may be non-cooperative.' 'We're working very closely with Air Mobility Command and AFRL [the Air Force Research Laboratory] to do what's called dynamic tanker repositioning,' George also added as an example of which mission autonomy in the context of the KC-135 could involve. 'So a big part of what tanker crews are doing today is coordinating with air battle managers, fighters and other [receivers]&#8230; to essentially optimally position the aircraft &#8230; to essentially meet in the middle. &#8230; especially in a dynamic mission, dynamically repositioning the tanker based off of not just where the aircraft are right now, but where the aircraft will be and where they will need fuel, is tremendously important, and we're going to be able to demonstrate some of those initial dynamic routing and capability sets, in addition to all the other autonomy features.' A KC-135 refueling F-16 fighters. USAF It's worth highlighting specific of the Merlin Pilot having some ability to engage with air traffic control is significant just for routine day-to-day flying, especially within domestic U.S. airspace. The military and commercial aviation sectors globally have been working hard for years now just on general sense-and-avoid capabilities as part of efforts to make it safer for increasingly autonomous uncrewed platforms to operate an ecosystem with crewed ones. In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) continues to place heavy restrictions on where and when completely uncrewed aircraft can operate, which was highlighted earlier this year by the appearance of the pilot-optional Model 437 Vanguard demonstrator from Northrop Grumman subsidiary Scaled Composites. For the U.S. military, having a human somewhere on the loop looks set to be a requirement for autonomous capabilities in the air and anywhere else for the foreseeable future. 'We very much believe in sort of this human-in-the-loop, on-the-loop, off-the-loop progression, and enabling during a mission the human to go from those three states depending on, you know, mission need and operational need,' Merlin's George told us. 'Because if you just say, 'hey, [the] human is going to be totally off the loop, that's not great. And if you're saying 'hey, the human has to be in the loop for everything,' that's also not super helpful.' 'So being able to have a fully functioning take-off-to-touchdown autonomy system that's able to go do everything the human pilot is able to go do in the flight deck, but enabling that human monitor to be in, on, or off, is tremendously important,' he continued. Merlin and the Air Force do have ambitions to be able to operate KC-135s in a fully uncrewed mode if desired, which is the second use case for the Merlin Pilot package being looked at now, according to the company's CEO George. He explicitly highlighted how this could also open up a new possibility for regenerating KC-135s currently sitting idle in the boneyard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona without necessarily increasing manpower requirements. KC-135s, as well as other aircraft, in storage at the Bone Yard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. kitmasterbloke via Flickr The Air Force has studied options for bringing some of those tankers back into service with the help of private contractors in the past, but has so far declined to do so. The U.S. military has been expanding its use of contractor-owned and operated tankers, including KC-135s, for non-combat missions in recent years, which helps free up organic aerial refueling capacity to support combat operations and otherwise reduces strain on those fleets. When it comes to more autonomous aerial refueling operations, whether it be with KC-135s or any other type, a major outstanding question is about actually linking up with receivers. This is even more pronounced when it comes to refueling using the boom method, which is the Air Force's preferred way of getting gas to aircraft in flight. Boom-equipped tankers today require dedicated human operators to safely make and maintain that connection. On the KC-135, that individual is physically situated looking out of the rear of the aircraft to perform this task. Boeing, the original manufacturer of the KC-135 and of the Air Force's newer KC-46s, has been working with the Air Force on more automated boom refueling capabilities, including the ability to refuel uncrewed platforms, over the years. The KC-46 notably features a remote vision system (RVS) that boom operators on those aircraft use to do their work from the aircraft's main cabin. The RVS has been beset by serious issues and is currently undergoing a complete redesign. Airbus in Europe has also been pushing forward on more advanced boom refueling capabilities requiring less human interaction. There has been significant progress with similar work involving probe-and-drogue refueling systems, as well. 'When we are talking about bringing autonomy to the tanker fleet, the autonomy has to perform as a human crew would perform. And today, the boom operator in the back of the airplane and the pilot flying the airplane are inextricably linked to each other,' Merlin's George said. 'They are flying that airplane essentially together as they're performing the mission. So, while we can't talk too much about it quite yet, we are extremely cognizant of the fact that boom autonomy is a huge part of delivering an autonomous tanking capability. 'It is something that we are actively thinking about and actively pursuing as part of the broader tanker mission autonomy system that not only are we deploying on the KC-135, but that we will likely put forward as the autonomy system for NGAS,' he added. NGAS here refers to the Air Force's Next Generation Air-refueling System effort, the requirements for which are still being finalized. NGAS is consistently described as a 'system of systems,' the core element of which has long been expected to be an entirely new stealthy tanker that might be crewed, uncrewed, or pilot-optional. However, there is now serious uncertainty around the NGAS plans as the Air Force faces worrisome concerns about the affordability of several top-priority modernization programs. A recent rendering from Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works advanced projects division of a notional stealth tanker concept in a pilotless configuration. Lockheed Martin Skunk Work Another Skunk Works rendering showing a national crewed stealth tanker concept. Lockheed Martin Skunk Works 'Essentially the threat, China again, has reached out with new counter-air systems that could threaten our aircraft, especially tankers, at longer ranges, beyond the ranges which we normally would refuel fighter planes,' Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall said in a keynote address at the Airlift/Tanker Association’s (ATA) annual symposium on Nov. 1. 'This put our whole tanker acquisition strategy in question. It is still in question, but we are working to resolve the uncertainty as quickly as possible.' 'The variable that concerns me most as we go through this analysis and produce a range of alternatives is going to be [the availability of adequate resources.] … to pursue any combination of those new designs,' Kendall also said, referring to NGAS, as well as plans for a new stealthy crewed sixth-generation combat jet and Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones as part of the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative. A notional sixth-generation stealth combat jet. Collins Aerospace This, in turn, has put new emphasis on options for increasing the survivability and other capabilities of existing tankers. 'The need for improved connectivity and some degree of enhanced self-protection measure[s] appears to be attractive from both an affordability and cost-effectiveness perspective,' Kendall added in his ATA keynote. 'It is also something that can be accomplished in relatively short time frames at relatively low cost.' The Air Force has already been experimenting with new data-sharing capabilities for the KC-135, as well as their ability to control dedicated loyal wingmen-type drones to help protect them. There has also been talk of turning them into aerial motherships for launching swarms of smaller drones. New autonomous capabilities for Air Force KC-135s is another area that the service is clearly continuing to invest in. Merlin's existing work for the Air Force is not limited to the KC-135 or NGAS, either, and could also feed into broader autonomy efforts across the service and the rest of the U.S. military. The company is also on contract with U.S. Special Operations Command to demonstrate the Merlin Pilot integrated onto a C-130-type aircraft. Air Force MC-130J special operations tanker/transport aircraft, like the one seen here, could also benefit from the Merlin Pilot's capabilities in the future. Sierra Nevada Corporation An AFSOC MC-130J Commando II. This particular example has gone through a number of recent upgrade programs, including one that adds the new Silent Knight terrain-following/terrain avoidance radar to the nose. Sierra Nevada Corporation 'So clearly, each different type of aircraft has different vehicle-level autonomy, and they clearly have slightly different missions, Right? An F-16 has a very different mission than the KC-135 which has a very different mission than an AC-130J, which has a very, very different mission than a B-52,' Merlin CEO George said. 'But across those airplanes, the flight autonomy bit, right, the aviate, navigate, communicate, fly the airplane while executing on the mission [bit], is fairly common.' 'In our opinion, the KC-135 [work] is even more important as a core maturation sandbox for flight autonomy across the force, especially as the Air Force moves into a much more integrated sort of core capability developer,' he continued. Altogether, an interesting future for the Air Force's venerable KC-135s continues to take shape, which may have implications, especially when it comes to autonomous capabilities, that stretch well beyond those tankers.

Russia’s 50,000-Soldier-Strong Push To Kick Ukraine Out Of Kursk ...	Vladimir Putin’s much-anticipated second counteroffensive against the three-month-old Ukrainian occupation of Russia’s Kursk region appears to be underway in a much larger fashion than the one launched in September. This time, not only are there far more Russian troops, but there appears to be the first deployment of a significant number of North Korean troops in combat on Russia's behalf as well. 'They are now doing the order of their military leadership, trying to push our troops out and push deep into the territory we hold,' Col.-Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, Commander-in-Chief of Ukraine’s Armed Forces, announced on Facebook Monday after visiting the region. The commander of Ukraine's Armed Forces, Col.-Gen. Oleksandr Syskyi said he visited troops in Russia's Kursk region. (Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff) To end this invasion, which Ukrainian officials say has occupied about 500 square miles of territory, Russia has amassed about 50,000 troops, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Monday. That includes some from North Korea, The New York Times reported on Sunday, citing U.S. and Ukrainian officials. In the Kursk region, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are holding back a 50,000-strong enemy group, Zelenskyi in a night address'By the end of the year, European partners should have time to fully implement the initiative to supply 1 million shells for our artillery.' pic.twitter.com/h202C4Fjlh&mdash; MilitaryNewsUA (@front_ukrainian) November 11, 2024 Ukraine had been steadily losing ground in Kursk since September after Russia launched a previous attempt to kick them out. However, they've largely managed to hold ground in recent weeks, while significant parts of the Kursk battleground remain in flux and controlled by neither side. Whether this counteroffensive will result in large thrusts or chipping away at Ukrainian positions is unclear at the moment. Attacks seemed to have increased in the past few days, with Russian forces attempting to chew off pieces of the Ukrainian salient from several directions. 'Obviously, they will try to take back as much territory as possible' Rob Lee, a Russian military specialist at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia who recently returned from a visit to Ukraine, told us. 'But, given the quality of the Ukrainian units there, we may see Russia continue to chip away and make incremental advances.' Statements from Ukrainian troops and video from the battlefield indicate Russia has taken heavy losses in so-called 'meat attacks,' similar to how they’ve fought in eastern Ukraine. 'During two days of assault, the enemy did nothing except destroy their units and equipment, namely 28 units of the enemy's equipment and more than 100 [Russians] from the 810th brigade of the Russian marines,' Ukraine's 95th Brigade claimed on Telegram. 'But about a hundred more occupiers were seriously injured on the territory of Kursk. Our paratroopers repelled the desire of the Russians to continue the assault - the [Russians] began to retreat, but not all succeeded.' The War Zone cannot independently verify that claim.

The high quality of forces Kyiv has committed to Kursk has created a conundrum for Ukraine's thinly stretched military. In his message on Monday, Syrskyi claimed the invasion forced Russia to pull troops from the fight inside Ukraine. 'If not for the resilience of our soldiers, these tens of thousands of enemies from the best Russian strike units would storm our positions in the Pokrovsk, Kurakhove or Toretsk directions, which would significantly worsen the situation on the frontlines,' he said. However, U.S. officials have a different view. 'A new U.S. assessment concludes that Russia has massed the force without having to pull soldiers out of Ukraine’s east — its main battlefield priority — allowing Moscow to press on multiple fronts simultaneously,' The New York Times reported. Adding validity to that assessment, Russian troops continue to make gains in eastern Ukraine, especially near Kurakhove in the Donetsk region. 'The enemy continues to implement his large-scale plan to envelop the city, entering from the flanks,' the Ukrainian DeepState open-source intelligence collective stated on Telegram Monday. 'As we noted earlier, [the Russians], having increased the pressure from new directions, are trying to enter the logistical routes of the Defense Forces, and from that moment on, this process is only gaining momentum. As of today, Muscovites are storming the positions of the Ukrainian military from the north, south and east:' 'We have to remind once again that ‘lies will destroy us all,’' DeepState complained. 'But even in attracting additional resources that arrive in the Kurakhove region, questions of the adequacy of the deployment arise. With such actions, the loss of control over Kurakhove remains a matter of time. And if the problem with the flanks is not taken under control, then very soon it will turn into another disaster.' DeepState reports difficult situation around Kurakhove, which could become catastrophic Ukrainska Pravda in English (@pravda_eng) November 11, 2024 As part of their advance, Russian forces have damaged the Kurakhove dam, according to the regional governor. 'This strike potentially threatens residents of settlements on the Vovchii River, both in Donetsk region and in Dnipro region,' Vadym Filashkin said on Telegram. In mid September we crossed the dam over the Kurakhove reservoir several times. And each time we crossed it, it got more destroyed by the Russians. They used FABs in the morning and in the afternoon to detonate the dam, cut the road and lower the water level of the lake … pic.twitter.com/DxEljvAMc6&mdash; Julian Röpcke (@JulianRoepcke) November 11, 2024 The losses in the east are not going unnoticed by Ukrainian troops, who are questioning the value of the Kursk gambit. Syrskyi’s strategy 'raises questions among some military personnel who do not understand why resources are being directed to the Kursk region while the defense in the Donbas is weakening,' the Spanish El Pais newspaper posited, citing an interview with a former Ukrainian commander. 'Perhaps our leaders have some big secret plan, otherwise I don't understand why our best brigades are in Kursk region, while our ‘defense’ in Ukraine is falling apart,' the newspaper quotes Ukrainian Maj. Gen. Dmitry Marchenko, who recently announced his dismissal from the army. Making matters worse for Ukraine, there are about 10,000 North Korean troops in Kursk, according to the Pentagon. They are part of a cadre of what the head of the Ukrainian Defense Intelligence Directorate told us was some 12,000 of Pyongyang’s soldiers in Russia. There are fresh claims that the North Koreans are involved in the fighting. 'North Korean troops were taking part in direct combat operations in Kursk, as well as defensive operations in the neighboring Belgorod region of Russia and in Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories,' a Ukrainian commander told CNN Sunday. 'Mostly, the tasks are defined as the second echelon of defense. In the Kursk region, these are direct combat operations,' he said, adding that among the personnel were specialist artillerymen and snipers.' The North Korean troops were a 'significant resource' for Russia’s war on Ukraine, the commander continued, noting that even those being deployed defensively would free up Russian troops for assault operations elsewhere and would themselves eventually be used in direct combat.

'It depends on where Ukraine chooses to prioritize,' Rob Lee suggested to us. 'Kursk clearly remains a priority given the size of the force and the quality of the units committed there. The operation has stretched Ukrainian forces and has likely contributed to Russia's increased rate of advance elsewhere on the front line.' 'Russia,' he added, 'will likely continue to try to push Ukrainian forces out of Kursk while also continuing offensive operations elsewhere on the front. A potential offensive from Zaporizhzhia could stretch Ukrainian forces even more.' All this comes against the backdrop of political change in the U.S, Ukraine's biggest backer. On Jan. 20, 2025, Donald J. Trump will once again become president. While the mercurial Trump claims he can quickly end the war in a plan he has yet to make public, there are concerns that he might abandon Ukraine if such a deal is not accepted by Kyiv. However, the issue is far more nuanced and complex, as we noted in our deep dive on the subject which you can read more about here. When it comes to U.S. involvement with Ukraine, President-elect Donald Trump will shuffle the deck. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Chip Somodevilla As we previously reported, Zelensky sees Kursk as a bargaining chip. 'Our operation is aimed to restore our territorial integrity,' Zelensky said in early September. 'We capture Russian troops to replace them with the Ukrainians. The same attitude is to the territories. We don’t need their land.' Unfortunately for Ukraine, Zelensky is playing a steadily weakening hand. While both sides are struggling to meet recruiting goals, Russia has a far larger pool to pull from and is regenerating its forces more quickly. Meanwhile, should North Korean troops see success on the battlefield, Kim Jong-un could send tens of thousands more to Russia, not just for fighting in Kursk, but also in Ukraine. One Western official told the Times that the Kursk invasion 'thinned out its forces across the battlefield in eastern Ukraine, leaving them vulnerable to Russian advances. But that official, and U.S. officials, said Ukraine still had a strong defense in Kursk and might be able to hold, at least for a time.' Though Ukraine continues to lose troops and territory, Zelensky will likely do whatever he can to keep Kursk contested until Trump takes office and negotiations can begin.

Chinese Hypersonic Boost Glide Vehicle Concept That Launches Its ...	A new Chinese concept for an unpowered hypersonic boost-glide weapon loaded with different types of submunitions, including supersonic missiles and drones, has emerged. Boost-glide vehicles already present significant challenges for defenders and one loaded with various sub-payloads could carry out kinetic strikes and non-kinetic operations like electronic warfare, as well as reconnaissance, against multiple targets across a broader area. While a weapon of this kind could present numerous benefits and additional complications for defenders, releasing payloads from a platform traveling at hypersonic speed also presents substantial technological challenges. A model of the new unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicle concept, called the GDF-600, and some of its payloads are on display at this year's Zhuhai Airshow in China, which formally opens tomorrow. The design comes from the Guangdong Aerodynamic Research Academy (GARA). GARA previously came to more widespread attention in 2022 with its unveiling of the MD-22, ostensibly an uncrewed hypersonic testbed details about which remain limited, at that year's Zhuhai Airshow.

The vehicle is said to be able to reach a peak speed of Mach 7 and have a maximum range of between approximately 124 and 370 miles (200 and 600 kilometers). Hypersonic speed is typically defined as anything above Mach 5. GARA has put forward five different potential payload types for the GDF-600: supersonic and subsonic missiles, a 'patrol projectile' (which appears to be a loitering munition or kamikaze drone), an uncrewed aerial system (UAS), and an unpowered kinetic strike munition. The GDF-600 model shows a mixed load of six 'patrol projectiles,' six UAS, and 13 subsonic missiles.

The weapon's range is dependent in part on how high and fast it gets to begin with and GARA says the GDF-600's trajectory can crest at up to some 131,233.5 feet (40 kilometers). There does not appear to be any specific mention of a particular launch platform for the GDF-600, but it could be adaptable to a ground, air, and/or sea-based weapon system. Hypersonic boost-glide weapons also glide along largely shallow atmospheric flight paths to their targets and are capable of making erratic movements along the way. The combination of speed and maneuverability creates significant complications for defenders, including just reducing the total amount of time available to react at all, let alone attempt an intercept. A graphic showing, in a very rudimentary way, the difference in trajectories between a traditional ballistic missile and a hypersonic boost-glide vehicle. Depictions of typical trajectories for aeroballistic (or quasi-ballistic) missiles and air-breathing hypersonic cruise missiles are also provided. GAO The value of the additional ability to release sub-payloads, potentially at several points along the boost-glide vehicle's flight path, is clear. A single boost-glide weapon would therefore have the ability to strike multiple targets (and different target sets) and do so across a broad area. The sub-payloads, especially drones, could be configured to carry out electronic warfare and other non-kinetic attacks and/or perform other tasks, including immediate bomb damage assessment and reconnaissance, as well as just acting as decoys. All of this only increases the challenges for defenders. In addition, some of the submunition types GARA has put forward would have the ability to substantially increase the overall range of the complete system. It says that the supersonic missiles could be able to travel up to 310 miles (500 kilometers) from their launch point. If they were released in the terminal phase of the GDF-600's flight, this could almost double the range of the entire weapon. The sub-payloads at that point would also have benefited from the boost-glide vehicle's initial penetration through layers of an enemy's air and missile defense network. As described now, especially given its range, the GDF-600 would seem more optimized for employment in a more regional context, such as a Taiwan Strait or South China Sea scenario. However, GARA claims its new submunition-laden hypersonic glide vehicle concept could be scaled up to a design offering an intercontinental range of up to 3,728 miles (6,000 kilometers). It's interesting to note here that the U.S. Army has been looking into the possibility of adding submunition payloads, including small drones, to future iterations of its Precision Strike Missile (PrSM). The PrSM is a short-range ballistic missile that could also evolve into a longer-range weapon. The PrSM is set to replace the Army Tactical Missile System (ATAMCS) short-range ballistic missile in Army service, which was also originally designed to carry a traditional cluster munition warhead with hundreds of small bomblets. A US Army Briefing slide that discusses a drone swarm payload for the PrSM, among other weapons. US Army At the same time, it is unclear how advanced GARA's work on the GDF-600 might be at this time. Launching payloads from something traveling at hypersonic speeds presents its own relatively massive technological challenges, particularly due to physical and thermal stresses, especially at the time of separation. More fragile payloads like drones would require some means of safely slowing down to subsonic speeds first. A high-speed picture showing submunitions being released from a US Army weapon system at supersonic speed during a test using the Holloman High Speed Test Track at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico. USAF Wedge-shaped hypersonic boost-glide vehicles are also understood to be more complex to begin with than conical types. The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) has operationally fielded at least one wedge-shaped hypersonic boost-glide vehicle weapon that is launched from the ground via a missile-like booster, the DF-17. The U.S. government also says that China has successfully tested a novel nuclear-capable orbital weapon system that includes a hypersonic glide vehicle capable of launching sub-payloads, which also underscores a general interest in the kinds of capabilities the GDF-600 could offer. A top-down look at two of the DF-17 mockups on parade in 2019. China Military Online DF-17 mockups on parade in Beijing in 2019. China Military If nothing else, the GDF-600 reflects the PLA's significant and still-growing investments in the development and fielding of hypersonic weapons, including air and ship-launched types. This also now comes as the U.S. military has faced significant issues in its own work in this regard, especially when it comes to hypersonic boost-glide vehicle designs. The future of the U.S. Air Force's AGM-183A Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW), or a potential follow-on program, remains notably murky. The U.S. Army has also faced setbacks with its Dark Eagle hypersonic missile program, a weapon the service being developed in cooperation with the U.S. Navy. The GDF-600, if it becomes a reality, could be an important new step for China's hypersonic arsenal.

New Version Of Chinese PL-15 Air-To-Air Missile Tailored For Stea...	China’s PL-15 active-radar-guided air-to-air missile has been reworked for improved internal carriage in the country’s stealth fighters, the Chengdu J-20 and the Shenyang J-35. This development is significant, with the promise that these fighters should, in the future, be able to carry larger loads of longer-reaching missiles while maintaining their low-observable characteristics. Full-size mock-ups of the revised PL-15E were unveiled at the China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition, better known as Airshow China, in Zhuhai. While the event doesn’t officially open until tomorrow, it has already sprung various surprises, including new versions of land-based and carrier fighters seen for the first time and at least one previously unseen drone.

The cruciform tail fins now simply fold around the midway point, deploying once the missile is released from the aircraft. Meanwhile, the cruciform center-body fins are of reduced span compared to those on the original missile. The PL-15E was displayed next to a short-range infrared-guided PL-10E air-to-air missile, in front of a mockup of the recently revealed J-35A stealth fighter and again in front of a mockup of the two-seat J-20S stealth fighter.

Photo by Ruan Yulin/China News Service/VCG via Getty Images China News Service Already, the basic PL-15 can fit in the weapons bays of the J-20, at least. From the start, it appears the missile was tailored for internal carriage, with the original version already having distinctive cropped fins to reduce its dimensions, similar to the changes introduced on the American AIM-120C. Close-up of a J-20 fighter carrying four inert examples of the original PL-15 in its main ventral bays. via Chinese Internet The new PL-15E, therefore, is likely designed to be better accommodated in the weapons bay of the smaller J-35, and intended to increase the number of medium-range missiles that the J-20 can carry. Currently, four of the standard PL-15s can be carried in the J-20’s internal weapons bay. Both those possibilities could also be true, with the PL-15E providing a dedicated internal medium-range air-to-air weapon for the J-35, and a way of accommodating more missiles internally in the J-20. While we have not seen inside the weapons bay of the J-35 thus far, there are indications that it is scaled to carry six medium-range air-to-air missiles — very likely the compressed-carriage PL-15E version.

At the 2021 Airshow China, a PL-15E was also exhibited, described as an export version. Apart from a slightly reduced range, this was otherwise similar in appearance to the basic PL-15. PL-15 air-to-air missile features an active electronically scanned array radar seeker and has a range exceeding 200 km. In Zhuhai air show 2021,China presented an export variant of PL-15 named PL-15E with a maximum range of 145km. #AirshowChina2021 pic.twitter.com/6gWSTD5cdI&mdash; 彩云香江 (@louischeung_hk) October 1, 2021 As you can read about in our in-depth story on Chinese air-to-air missiles, the PL-15 is China’s standard active-radar-guided AAM and it apparently was intended to at least match the performance of the U.S.-made AIM-120D. The PL-15 has a dual-pulse rocket motor that provides a reported range of 124 miles. Another important feature is a two-way datalink that allows the launching aircraft to provide guidance updates to the missile. The missile seeker uses active electronically scanned array (AESA) technology, with active and passive modes, and it’s claimed to have better resistance to countermeasures than previous Chinese air-to-air missiles. The typical air-to-air load-out for the J-10 (like this J-10C) comprises PL-15 (inboard) and PL-10 (outboard) AAMs. via Chinese internet As well as being the main armament of the J-20, the PL-15 is now also used by most other modern Chinese fighters, including the J-10C, J-11B, J-15, and J-16. The first export operator was Pakistan, which acquired PL-15s for its JF-17 Block III and J-10C fighters. All in all, the PL-15 — even in its basic form — is widely assessed as being a very capable air-to-air missile and one that is likely superior in some respects to certain Western equivalents. The Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) defense and security think tank determines that the PL-15 'out-ranges the U.S.-made AIM-120C/D AMRAAM series and has a comparable maximum range to the Meteor.' Reflecting this, the development and fielding of the PL-15 has been a major driver behind the United States launching a program of improvements for its AIM-120D, creating a stopgap weapon before the new long-range AIM-260 enters widespread service. The AIM-260 program itself was also largely a response to Chinese AAM developments. In the meantime, the U.S. Navy’s AIM-174 air-to-air missile is also seen as a direct counter to China, to make full use of so-called kill webs for very long-range engagements in the Pacific theater. As well as working on secretive new range air-to-air missiles, the United States has also been looking at ways to increase the ‘magazine depth’ of its existing fighters, specifically adding more missiles to the F-22 and F-35, which are constrained by their internal weapons carriage — provided they are to retain their critical low-observability advantage. In the air-to-air configuration, the F-22 carries six AMRAAMs and two AIM-9 Sidewinders. However, the F-35 can only carry four internal AMRAAMs, which led to a program to develop the Sidekick weapons bay adapter, which will boost the number of internal AMRAAMs a Joint Strike Fighter can carry to six. The United States has also been working on more radical ways of increasing internal air-to-air missile capacity. The Raytheon Peregrine is a design for a new medium-range missile that combines superior performance with small size, potentially doubling the number of missiles that an F-35 or F-22 can carry internally. Concept art of the Peregrine missile, being launched by an F-22. Raytheon www.twz.com A similar miniaturized beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile, Lockheed Martin’s Cuda, was promoted in the early 2010s, though more recently it seems to have largely disappeared from the company’s marketing. It seems that Cuda would have been a shorter-range weapon than AMRAAM and would utilize a hit-to-kill design to help reduce its dimensions. It would be surprising if China, too, isn’t working on all-new air-to-air missiles that are optimized for internal carriage. In the meantime, however, it seems the PL-15 has been further optimized to arm both the J-20 and J-35 as China continues on its path of stealth fighter development — as well as the appropriate weapons to arm these aircraft.

North Korea’s Wacky Type 73 Machine Guns May Be Entering The Figh...	The peculiar North Korean Type 73 machine gun is getting new attention as a result of the Hermit Kingdom's expanding support for Russia's war in Ukraine, which now includes the deployment of thousands of troops. The weapon, chambered in the Russian 7.62x54mmR cartridge, is a unique blending of Cold War Soviet and Czech designs. Pictures showing Type 73s, which are said to have been taken in Russia's Kursk region recently, first began circulating online yesterday. There are competing unconfirmed reports that North Korean troops may have brought the guns with them or that Pyongyang is supplying them as military aid to Russian forces. Russia is known to have received various weaponry from North Korea already, including KN-23 short-range ballistic missiles, Bulsae-4 anti-tank missile vehicles, and rocket-propelled grenades, along with millions of artillery round and various kinds of other ammunition. Photos circulating on telegram this afternoon, of North Korean Type 73s said to be in Russia (the EMR trousers leg supports that). Various posts claiming A.

The North Korean gun combines design elements from at least three different machine guns: the Czech 7.62x39mm Vz. 52/57 machine gun and the Soviet 7.62x54mmR Soviet RP-46 (itself a belt-fed version of the Soviet DP family) and PK series. A Czech Vz. 52 machine gun in a museum in Israel. The main difference between the Vz. 52 and the 52/57 variant is the switch from the Czech 7.62x45mm caliber to the Soviet 7.62x39mm. Bukvoed via Wikimedia A Soviet DP-27 machine gun in a museum in Finland. The RP-46 is a belt-fed version of this gun. MKFI A member of the US Army fires a PK-type machine gun during training. US Army What is most immediately notable about the roughly 22-pound (empty) and four-foot-long Type 73 is that it can feed from a top-mounted box magazine (like the Vz. 52/57) or a belt of ammunition loaded in from the right side (also like the Vz. 52/57, as well as the RP-46 and PK). When used with a box magazine, the gun has an especially archaic look reminiscent of designs dating back to even before World War II like the Czech ZB-26 and the British Bren. The Bren, as well as Vz. 52/57, were themselves derived from the ZB-26. The Type 73's unusual features also include a muzzle device that allows for the firing of rifle grenades. When that capability isn't in use, a cover that includes a muzzle brake can be screwed onto the front end of the gun's nearly two-foot-long barrel. A picture of a Type 73 machine gun said to have been taken in Russia. This example has the screw-on cover fitted over the front end of the barrel. via X Believed to have entered North Korean service in 1973, hard details about the Type 73 and its development remain scant. 'Frankly, this is the result of&#8230; several of North Korea's previous leaders, Kim Jong Il and Kim Il Sung, both being &#8230; like actually gun guys. And they were both big fans of Czechoslovakian firearms in particular,' firearms expert Ian McCollum, who runs the Forgotten Weapons website, said in a video on the Type 73 back in 2022, which you can watch in full below. There is a certain logic behind the design. Ammunition belts can be cumbersome for units to carry during active operations or even localized patrols. A box magazine, while offering less immediate ammunition capacity, would help make the gun easier to handle on the move, including when firing from the shoulder. At 22 pounds empty, the Type 73 is just over two pounds heavier than a typical current-generation Russian PKM, but is substantially lighter than the U.S. Army's standard 7.62x51mm M240B light machine gun, which tips the scales at nearly 28 pounds before a belt of ammunition is even loaded. A top-mounted magazine also allows the gunner to get and stay lower to the ground while firing from a prone position without sacrificing capacity. 'So the concept here was you would carry this with a box magazine in it for any sort of immediate action that might be necessary, for example, on a patrol or something,' McCollum says in his 2022 video. 'And then, if you got into a position where you actually had to be using the gun for sustained fire, that's when you would instead start feeding it belts.' A North Korean soldier fires a Type 73 using the magazine feed option. North Korean State Media Again, while information is limited, the Type 73 does not appear to have been overly popular in North Korean service. 'Frankly, the Czech 52/57 wasn't really all that successful, either. The concept of belt or magazine dual-feed systems never really took off. As far as I can tell, it's something that&#8230; sounded better on paper than it actually was in practice. And it turned out people just always wanted to go with the belts,' according to McCollum. 'And so having the magazine feed was sort of an extraneous complication to the gun. It made them more expensive to manufacture. It gives you extra openings for dirt to get in other potential malfunctions and all that sort of stuff.' By the 1980s, the North Koreans had developed a new Type 82 machine gun, which is a PK-series clone. The PK family has been and continues to be one of the most popular light machine gun designs globally. Variants of that design are in widespread service on both sides of the war in Ukraine. 'It seems that many Type 73s were moved to reserve or militia service, but nobody can be sure,' Dan Shea and Heebum Hong wrote in an article for Small Arms Defense Journal in 2013. 'While it could sometimes be seen in 1970s propaganda and at military parades, from the early 1980s it’s been more and more difficult to see one in use.' North Korean soldiers fire Type 73 machine guns, including a silver-colored one, likely intended for parade or other ceremonial use. North Korean State Media Before now, Type 73 has appeared outside of North Korea only in relatively small numbers and largely due to Iran, which acquired some number of the guns during the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s. The guns have since shown up in the hands of Iranian proxies in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, as well as with militant groups in Africa. An Iraqi militiaman circa the mid-2010s with a Type 73 machine gun. via X Between 2016 and 2017, Australian and French forces seized a number of Type 73s during maritime interdiction operations in and around the Arabian Sea. Some official and other expert sources at the time described them as being variants or derivatives of the Soviet RPD light machine gun design, underscoring just how rare they are to see outside of North Korea. A picture of a Type 73 seized somewhere in the Arabian Sea in 2016 mistakenly identified as an 'RPD-pattern light machine gun.' Conflict Armament Research For Russian forces, an influx of any additional machine guns, especially ones that use a widely available ammunition type, could be something of a boon. The conflict in Ukraine has already seen both sides make use of older and ostensibly obsolete weapons, including machine guns dating back to World War II or before, to help bolster their arsenals. If North Korean Type 73s are indeed being fielded to Russian units or are otherwise being actively used in Russia's war against Ukraine, new details about the guns, including how the design performs in actual combat, may now start to emerge.

Our Best Look Yet China’s New Stealthy Trimaran Drone Ship	Clearer views of a new stealthy Chinese trimaran uncrewed surface vessel (USV) have emerged, highlighting a number of interesting features, including a vertical launch system (VLS) array and aft-end flight deck for drone helicopters. New images of the stealthy USV, which look to have been taken at or near ground level, first began circulating online last week. A surge in interest in the drone ship had followed its appearance in high-resolution satellite imagery of Guangzhou Shipyard International (GSI) facilities on Longxue Island just southeast of the city of Guangzhou earlier in the year. The same imagery also revealed a still mysterious new class of Chinese ship with a large open flight deck. You can read our report on it here.

There is a possibility these images could be further manipulated or be renders rather than real pictures. The side views do show the USV having a four-cell vertical launch system (VLS) array in a relatively large and potentially modular open section on top of its main superstructure.

What looks to be a traditional rotating maritime navigation radar antenna, as well as multiple sensor turrets of the type typically equipped with electro-optical and infrared cameras, are visible on top. Those sensors would be needed just for semi-autonomous operation, including deconflicting with other ships at sea, in addition to surveillance and target detection/tracking type functions. Rectangular sections at various points lower on the mast structure point to at least the provisions for additional radars and electronic warfare/electronic support measures (EW/ESM) systems. A closer look at the new trimaran USV's mast structure and extension on top showing various sensors and emitters, and/or provisions for them in the picture taken from the rear. Chinese Internet The USV also has a small flight deck at the stern configured to support a drone helicopter. Chinese aviation firms have been separately developing a growing number of uncrewed helicopters, including ones configured for naval applications. Overall, the core shape of the mast and other portions of the ship's external structure, at least, point to radar signature-reducing design considerations. By all indications, the new Chinese trimaran USV is the JARI-USV-A, a 300-ton displacement design that has reportedly been under construction in Guangzhou since 2022. Huangpu Shipyard may be the actual builder, according to a recent report from Naval News. Huangpu and GSI are both subsidiaries of the state-run China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC). 'JARI' in the name also refers to comes from the Jiangsu Automation Research Institute, which has also been involved in the development of a smaller 20-ton-displacement JARI-USV with traditional hull profile. JARI was originally established as part of the state-owned China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation (CSIC), which CSSC absorbed in 2019. Interestingly the final configuration appears to be somewhat closer to the 'Jari-USV-A' (not the Jari) concept model shown years ago vs the graphic shown at launch of the project. pic.twitter.com/WbjrzkekzH&mdash; Alex Luck (@AlexLuck9) October 28, 2024 Another unrelated trimaran USV design had previously emerged in China in 2020. However, the USV now sitting in GSI's yard differs in significant ways from models and renders of the JARI-USV-A that have been shown in the past, which notably featured an eight-cell VLS array in a much lower-profile main superstructure. The earlier design also had what looked to be torpedo tubes nestled in its side sponsons and a remotely-operated weapon system with a gun and missile launchers that could be fully retracted into a section of the bow. Whether or not these features have been carried over to the newer design is unknown. Satellite imagery of China's JARI USV (trimaran version). The hull seems completed.

It could also be used as a network relay and kinetic platform, as well. The USVs could also just offer valuable additional capacity to provide localized maritime presence, including around more far-flung outposts like China's man-made islands in the hotly contested South China Sea. Its shallow draft would make it very well suited for operations in littoral area.s Similarly sized crewed Type 022 catarman missile boats are among the assets the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) currently uses for those kinds of missions. A Type 022 missile boat. PLAN Whether or not the new USV is expected to be an operational platform, or just a testbed for future developments, is unclear. Naval News posited that the trimaran drone ship, as well as the new carrier-like ship in GSI's yard (which we've now seen curiously bears the CSSC company logo rather than clear naval-style markings), could be more experimental in nature and also intended in part to help with export pitches to foreign navies. Similar questions have been raised about exact the intended purposes of the trimaran USV design that previously emerged in China, as well as a new stealthy crewed corvette design that first broke cover in the country last year. A look at the other known Chinese trimaran USV design. Chinese Internet The PLAN certainly does have a history of building bespoke vessels ostensibly for research and development, test and evaluation, and training roles. At the same time, from what we have now seen, the new USV has a configuration that is at least potentially operationally representative and that could point to the possibility of a future fleet of operational drone ships based on this design. Even if the new trimaran drone ship is ostensibly a test platform, it underscores the PLAN's clear ambitions (and those of the rest of the PLA) to increase its uncrewed capabilities across all domains. The PLAN has been very actively working to expand the scale and scope of its crewed surface warship and submarine capabilities in recent years, backed by China's substantial shipbuilding industrial base. In this broader context, it is also worth noting that China's public interest in trimaran USVs emerged following the U.S. military's highly successful work with a design called Sea Hunter. The U.S. Navy still has that USV, as well as a second example named Seahawk, but has so far not moved to acquire more of them for operational use. The service has been working to operationalize other USVs in recent years, but the main focus so far has been on smaller and less capable designs. Testbed or not, the new Chinese USV is the latest evidence that the coutnry continues to push ahead with its own increasingly more advanced uncrewed naval capabilities.

U.S. Contractors Will Be Allowed To Fix F-16s, Patriots In Ukrain...	In a major policy change, the Biden administration will now allow U.S. contractors on the ground in Ukraine to help its military maintain and repair some of the $61 billion worth of weapons donated by America, CNN reported. In particular, the shift is designed to help keep F-16 Vipers and Patriot air defense batteries in working order. Until this decision, the Biden administration has allowed only a small number of U.S. troops in Ukraine, mainly to help keep tabs of U.S. donated equipment, but no Defense Department (DoD) civilian contractors. However, there are a number of U.S. contractors working in Ukraine directly for that country. More here: Natasha Bertrand (@NatashaBertrand) November 8, 2024 The move was approved earlier this month, CNN reported, citing 'an official with direct knowledge.' 'In order to help Ukraine repair and maintain military equipment provided by the US and its allies, DoD is soliciting bids for a small number of contractors who will help Ukraine maintain the assistance we’ve already provided,' a defense official told the network. Continuing its sensitivity toward escalating the conflict and angering Moscow, the Biden administration won’t allow those contractors anywhere near the fighting. 'These contractors will be located far from the front lines and they will not be fighting Russian forces,' the official told CNN. 'They will help Ukrainian Armed Forces rapidly repair and maintain U.S.-provided equipment as needed so it can be quickly returned to the front lines.' The change of heart came about because several of the systems provided to Ukraine - particularly F-16s and Patriots - 'require specific technical expertise to maintain,' the defense official said. The U.S. has not provided any F-16s to Ukraine, but has signed off on allowing a coalition of nations to transfer upwards of 85 of the U.S.-made fourth-generation fighters. The Pentagon has provided three U.S.-made Patriot batteries to Ukraine. Other allies have as well. Ukrainian personnel remove camouflage netting from a Patriot launcher, which is loaded with missile canisters associated with older interceptors like the PAC-2-series. Ukrainian Air Force Ukrainian Air Force Ukrainian personnel remove camouflage netting from a Patriot launcher, which is loaded with missile canisters associated with older interceptors like the PAC-2-series. Ukrainian Air Force After nearly three years of extremely heavy fighting, much of the equipment provided to Ukraine has worn down or been damaged and in need of repair. The Biden administration’s refusal to allow experienced U.S. contractors to work in Ukraine meant that the equipment had to be hauled out of the country and repaired in Poland, Romania or other NATO nations, or be done with remote help via video chat or secure phone. Both situations are suboptimal, creating delays in getting the weapons back into the fight or limiting the work that could be done in-country remotely. This is especially true for F-16s and Patriots, two very complex systems that require a high degree of maintenance by skilled technicians. Though these contractors will be far from the front lines, being in Ukraine has risks as Russia has raked the whole country with missiles and drones, To address that, companies bidding on contracts will be required to develop 'robust risk mitigation plans,' officials told CNN. Companies bidding for the contracts would be required to develop robust risk mitigation plans to reduce threats to their employees, officials told CNN. 'The Department made this decision after careful risk assessment and in coordination with interagency stakeholders,' the defense official said. 'Each US contractor, organization or company will be responsible for the safety and security of their employees and will be required to include risk mitigation plans as part of their bids.'

(Photo by George Frey/Getty Images) George Frey Unlike the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq where thousands of contractors lived in those countries on sprawling bases, this effort will be limited to between a few dozen and a couple of hundred personnel at a time. 'It is worth noting that there already are a wide array of American companies who have personnel in Ukraine fulfilling contracts for the Ukrainian government, so this will not lead to a substantial increase of employees of U.S. companies working on the ground in Ukraine,' the defense official told CNN. The officials said this new plan was launched before Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris was trounced in Tuesday’s election loss to now-President-elect Donald Trump. A huge wildcard here is whether the incoming administration continues this policy, something that is not a given considering Trump’s reticence about continuing support for Ukraine and in general keeping the U.S. involved in overseas conflicts. This move also comes as the lame-duck Biden administration is rushing to move some $6 billion worth of military aid to Ukraine before it has to pack up on Jan. 20. You can read more about what his second administration could mean for the war in Ukraine in our deep dive here. Whether these contracts can make it through the various hoops required for spending tax dollars for war efforts before Trump is sworn in remains to be seen. Trump's ultimate decision on risking the injury or death of U.S. personnel in Ukraine - or incurring the wrath of Russian President Vladimir Putin - is the biggest factor in how far this new program can progress.

Russia’s S-70 Hunter Flying Wing Drone Downed In Ukraine Packed W...	Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR) claims it has found dozens of Western-made components in the Russian S-70 Okhotnik-B (Hunter-B) flying wing unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) downed last month in a case of friendly fire. 'The aggressor state, despite sanctions, used components manufactured by Western companies to create this weapon,' GUR said on Telegram Friday. 'In particular, microelectronics and other technological components manufactured by the companies Analog Devices, Texas Instruments and Xilinx-AMD (USA), Infineon Technologies (Germany), STMicroelectronics (Switzerland) were found in the Russian S-70 Hunter.' GUR found components from several other companies as well. Ukraine's Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR) claims this wreckage of a Russian S-70 Hunter-B flying wing unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) contained at least 30 Western components. (GUR) The S-70 is a heavy-weight strike and reconnaissance tactical drone with some low observable (stealthy) features. It was also envisioned to be able to partake in air-to-air as well as air-to-ground combat and reconnaissance duties. Independent operations and those paired with other aircraft, both manned and unmanned, are envisioned for the type. GUR said the drone that went down in Ukraine was the fourth S-70 prototype. The directorate, which maintains a database of thousands of foreign components found in Russian weapons, published a list of 30 found in the S-70. Among them was a motor driver with a built-in current sensor made by Maxim Integrated Products, a transistor made by Infineon Technologies, a microprocessor made by Xilinx Inc, a power module made by Texas Instruments, an isolator made by Analog Devices and a microprocessor made by STMicroelectronics. There were dozens of other components from these and several other companies found as well. Maxim Current Sensor (GUR) Xilinkx microprocessor. (GUR) Russian weapons 'depend on foreign components,' GUR stated on its database. 'Without them, they cannot continue to fight, occupy and kill.' All told, GUR said it has found more than 4,000 foriegn components in nearly 150 captured or recovered Russian weapons. The discovery of those in the S-70 marks the latest example of how Russia is evading sanctions placed on it after launching its all-out war on Ukraine. The origin of those on the S-70 is unclear and GUR provided no futher information about how they were obtained by Russia. These would not necessarily have to have been sourced directly from the manufacturers, however. Also, there is a massive and largely unregulated market for recycled chips, largely emanating from China. In addition, many components are found in appliances and other non-military items. While those are harder to prevent falling into the wrong hands, U.S. officials have the authority to prevent shipments of those dual-use chips if they consider the application to have critical military uses. S-70 Okhotnik-B (Hunter-B) flying wing unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV). Russian MOD Screenshot/via X.com To help stem the flow of military technology to Russia, U.S. government agencies have issued sanctions against hundreds of companies around the world providing Russia with technology. Last month, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned 275 individuals and entities 'involved in supplying Russia with advanced technology and equipment that it desperately needs to support its war machine,' the department said in a media release. The 'action targets both individual actors and sprawling sanctions evasion networks across 17 jurisdictions, including India, the People’s Republic of China (PRC), Switzerland, Thailand, and Türkiye. In addition to disrupting global evasion networks, this action also targets domestic Russian importers and producers of key inputs and other materiel for Russia’s military-industrial base.' On Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury Department announced another round of sanctions against Russian officials. OFAC's designations include several Russian deputy defense ministers, including Anna Tsivileva, Vladimir Putin’s second cousin. Meduza in English (@meduza_en) October 31, 2024 There is no indication, however, that any of the chips in the S-70 violated any provisions. Moreover, the UCAV had been in development for years before sanctions were imposed on Russia. As we previously noted, the S-70 downed over Ukrainian territory appears to be one of the earlier examples, which first emerged in early 2019, or one built to a similar specification and is significantly lower in sophistication than a more refined variant with enhanced low-observable (stealth) features rolled out in 2021. After the S-70 was discovered, we pointed out that its wreckage 'may represent the most enticing foreign material exploitation (FME) opportunity of the conflict, and there have been many of them so far.' While not a find of any new technology, today’s announcement by GUR about the components highlights the importance of such efforts.

(Photo by Pierre Crom/Getty Images) Pierre Crom We reached out to the companies highlighted by GUR for their responses. 'ST is an integrated device manufacturer,' company spokesman Ronan Mulvaney told us in an email Friday. 'We work with more than 200,000 customers and thousands of partners around the world. We do not authorize nor condone the use of our products outside of their intended purpose.' The company, Mulvaney added, has a 'comprehensive global trade compliance program through which we comply with all international trade rules and regulations. We have an internal export control compliance program that contains training and procedures to assure compliance with various export controls regulations. As part of that program, we provide guidelines to our sales channels to assure each party in our supply chain understands its responsibility to comply with applicable laws and regulations. We also collaborate and exchange information with third parties undertaking field research efforts as well as various government and non-government organizations.' Since the start of Russia's all-out war, ST has 'taken actions to comply with the specific requirements of multiple sanction packages and export control measures implemented by the European Union, the United States, and partnering countries against Russia and Belarus,' Mulvaney explained. 'These actions include reinforcing the compliance requirements for all our sales channels - including vigilance against sanction evasion and shipping diversion, implementing additional end user screening measures, deploying automated solutions for customers and product checks, and enhancing our awareness communication to targeted stakeholders.' Furthermore, ST no longer has operations in Russia, Mulvaney stated. ST microprocessor. (GUR) Inferion has also taken steps to stop the flow of its components to Russia, the company told us. 'Compliance with applicable laws is of paramount importance for Infineon, and we have established robust policies and processes to comply with these laws,' company spokesman Andre Tauber told The War Zone in an email. A huge challenge, he said, is controlling sales 'throughout the entire lifetime of a product (Infineon produces around 30 billion chips per year). Still, we have taken extensive measures at our disposal to ensure compliance with sanctions aiming to not only comply with the letter but also with the spirit of the sanctions.' Infineon, Tauber added, 'has taken extensive measures to stop all direct and indirect shipments to Russia immediately after the Russian attack on Ukraine regardless of the legal possibility to continue certain transactions. As decided in March 2022, Infineon subsequently liquidated its entity in Russia.' The company has 'instructed all distribution partners globally to implement robust measures that will prevent any diversion of Infineon products or services contrary to the sanctions. Infineon has reiterated and specified this clear position several times in communications to its distribution partners.' In addition, Inferion is using 'various data sources to oversee compliance with existing regulations. In case we get tangible evidence that companies with which we have a business relationship are doing trade with Russia, we terminate the delivery and demand clarification from the company in question.' Infineon transistor (GUR) This is not by any means the first time components from some of these companies have been found on Russian weapons. Far from it in fact. A number were in weapons listed in database GUR provided to us in 2022. Back then, Inferion told us it had 'not found any evidence of military use of our products in Russia.' While other companies mentioned have yet to return messages today, Analog Devices responded in 2022. The company which eventually bought Maxim Integrated, told us it at the time that it was 'committed to full compliance with U.S, EU and other countries’ laws including export controls, trade sanctions and regulations,' said Ferda Millan, a company spokeswoman. Iranian and North Korean weapons used by Russia and recovered by Ukraine also contain large amounts of Western components. For example, in 2022 we reported that a number of electronic components powering the Iranian-made Mohajer-6 drones used by Russian forces in Ukraine were produced in the United States and other allied nations. Ukraine discovered that an Iranian-made Mojahar-6 drone used by Russia contained a number of foreign components. (Iranian State News) Perhaps even more alarming, a short-range ballistic missile (SRBM) produced by North Korea used against Ukraine by Russia earlier this year relied on more than 290 foreign-sourced components, many of them originating from U.S. manufacturers, according to a study by Conflict Armament Research (CAR), a U.K.-based investigative organization. The North Korean KN-23 short-range ballistic missile seen here may be among the types containing nearly 300 foreign-made components.( North Korean State Media) The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) acknowledges the challenge. 'The sheer global ubiquity of semiconductors underscores the challenge we face. According to World Semiconductor Trade Statistics, the semiconductor industry shipped over 3 trillion chips globally between 2021 and 2023,' SIA said in a recent blog. 'These volumes will only increase as global demand for semiconductors continues to boom, with global sales projected to reach $1 trillion by 2030. Trillions more chips – many of which were sold and shipped years before Russia invaded Ukraine – remain in circulation, often stockpiled in warehouses. Mature node, or so-called 'legacy' chips, have a shelf life that can last decades. So, it is unsurprising some chips recovered from Russian weapons in Ukraine were manufactured well before the beginning of the conflict, and in some cases by companies that no longer exist.' Russia 'also has decades of experience evading export controls and sanctions, building a system of transshipment routes, cultivating networks of diverters in third countries, and employing sophisticated deception tactics,' SIA noted. 'Malign actors go to great lengths to circumvent government restrictions and established company compliance actions, evading even the most sophisticated screening and due diligence efforts.' While it is exceedingly difficult for governments and companies to police the flow of these vital components, GUR offered a list of suggestions on how to improve the fight to stop it. Governments should 'approve the list of goods subject to enhanced export control ban their re-export to Russia, Belarus, Iran, and the DPRK and 'standardize enhanced inspection procedures during their deliveries to risky jurisdictions increase liability for violations and negligence.' In addition, banks should be 'involved in inspections and share information and synchronize efforts with other countries.' Meanwhile, manufacturers and distributors should 'form a list of products whose deliveries require enhanced inspections approve and regularly update inspection procedures taking into account recommendations, red-flags, sanctions circumvention schemes disseminate new inspection policies among counterparties.' They should also add a condition for their compliance to contracts, respond to detection of products in Russian weapons, investigate supply chain and get involved parties and governments to take measures to stop supplies, GUR argued. The companies who responded to our queries said they were taking such steps. However, given the vast number of components, companies, countries and profits involved, coordination and cooperation may be impossible to achieve on a grand scale. The fact that chips of all types get dumped into China's vast recycling ecosystem also makes stopping them falling into unwanted hands all but impossible. As a result, the S-70 Hunter-B won't be the last Russian weapon found to be packed Western-made components. Update: 4:15 PM Eastern - Analog Devices Inc. and Texas Instruments responded to our questions. Analog Devices Inc. (ADI) 'is committed to preventing the unauthorized resale, illicit diversion, and misuse of our products, and to complying with applicable laws and regulations in the countries where we operate,' company official Ferda Millan told us. 'We at ADI strongly condemn the illicit diversion and unintended misuse of our products.' Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and in compliance with U.S. and EU sanctions, 'ADI ceased business activities in Russia and the Russian-backed regions of Ukraine and Belarus, and promptly instructed all of our distributors to halt shipments of our products into these regions,' Millan added. 'Combating the unauthorized resale, diversion, and misuse of products and technologies is a challenge the entire semiconductor industry faces and one that ADI takes very seriously.' In addition 'ADI is dedicated to upholding high standards of compliance and transparency,' Millan explained. 'We continue to look for ways to identify and prevent third-party attempts to engage in unauthorized resale, diversion, or misuse of our products and technology.' The company 'firmly believes that preventing illicit diversion requires a unified effort and vigilant approach,' Millan continued. 'ADI supports and is cooperating with efforts by the U.S. Congress, federal government agencies, law enforcement, and non-governmental organizations to investigate improper diversion of semiconductor parts and take appropriate action to stop it. ' Analog isolator. (GUR) Texas Instruments (TI) 'strongly opposes the use of our chips in Russian military equipment and the illicit diversion of our products to Russia,' the company told The War Zone. 'TI stopped selling products into Russia and Belarus in February 2022. Any shipments of TI chips into Russia are illicit and unauthorized.' The company devotes 'significant time and resources to developing, implementing and refining policies and procedures to combat illicit diversion and keep chips out of the hands of bad actors,' TI added. 'Our dedicated global trade compliance team carefully monitors the sale and shipment of our products, including screening customers and orders multiple times throughout the ordering process. We regularly identify and block suspicious and fraudulent orders.' TI said it is company policy to 'comply with export control laws. We require our distributors and customers to comply with export control laws and prohibit them from reselling chips into Russia. If there is evidence indicating diversion, we investigate and take action.' 'We are committed to continually evolving and improving our efforts working collaboratively with law enforcement, government agencies, non-governmental organizations and industry partners.'

China’s Stealth CH-7 Long-Endurance Drone Emerges	The first example of China’s mysterious CH-7 stealthy flying-wing drone seems to have been revealed, although with a somewhat different look to it compared with previous mockups, and a very impressive size. This points to China’s accelerated efforts to develop low-observable, long-endurance drones and while this one appears to be tailored for intelligence, reconnaissance, and surveillance (ISR), there have long been claims that it also will undertake strike missions, as an uncrewed combat aerial vehicle (UCAV). Better resolution&#8230; absolutely Huge #ZhuhaiAirShow2024 CH-7 pic.twitter.com/dAhh8hVr3h&mdash; Húrin (@Hurin92) November 8, 2024 A video and stills released by Chinese state media today show the drone on a so-far unidentified runway and taxiing down it, day and night, although we don’t see it in the air. The yellow-colored coat of primer is frequently seen on Chinese aircraft during their test phase. Meanwhile, a pair of apparent air data probes on the lading edges of the wing point to this being a prototype or perhaps a pre-production machine. The apparent CH-7 prototype on the runway. via Chinese Internet At this point, it should be stressed that we don’t know for sure that this is the CH-7, but it certainly seems like the best fit and has been identified as such by various Chinese aerospace observers. There is also a possibility that we are seeing computer-generated images, or at least computer-enhanced ones, but there is nothing that would point conclusively to this being the case at this time. Developed by the state-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), specifically by its 11th Research Institute, the CH-7 (or Caihong-7, meaning Rainbow-7) is a high-altitude UCAV that is widely understood to be optimized for penetrating deep into hostile airspace. It would achieve this through a combination of low-observable (stealth) design and flying at very high altitudes, operating for extended periods of time without ever being detected. A close-up view of the apparent CH-7 prototype on the runway. via Chinese Internet The CH-7 has also gone through several different iterations since it was first revealed, with the design being progressively adapted. The drone was first unveiled in the form of a full-scale mockup at Airshow China 2018 in Zhuhai. At this point, it looked very much like a Chinese clone of the Northrop Grumman X-47B UCAV, with the same modified ‘cranked kite’ wing, although it featured canted wingtips instead of the triangular wingtip edges found on the U.S. aircraft. Visitors take pictures of the mockup of the CH-7 at Airshow China 2018 in Zhuhai, in the Guangdong province of southern China, on November 6, 2018.

WANG ZHAO/AFP via Getty Images Liang Xu By the time the CH-7 appeared again in model from at Zhuhai, for Airshow China 2022, it now had redesigned wing flaps, sharper canted wingtips, and a longer central engine nacelle hump. In the process, the dimensions of the drone also changed. In its 2018 form, published figures included a wingspan of 22 meters (72 feet), while the 2022 model represented a drone with a wingspan of 26 meters (85 feet). Other published specifications, which remain provisional, include a length of 10 meters (33 feet), a maximum takeoff weight of 10,000 kilograms (22,000 pounds), a maximum speed of 926 km/h (575 mph), and an endurance of up to 15 hours. These all apply to the 2022 version of the drone. The revised mockup of the CH-7 at Airshow China 2022 on November 6, 2022. Photo by VCG/VCG via Getty Images YANG SHUGUANG Otherwise, key features of the CH-7 include a dorsally mounted intake for a so-far unidentified turbofan engine, and an internal payload bay, for weapons and sensors. In the latest video the drone’s wing appears less sharply swept than on the 2022 model. It also seems that the drone has grown in size, at least based on a rough comparison of the landing gear and the engine exhaust aperture with those on the mock-ups. Notable features when looking at the rear aspect of the drone in its latest version include prominent gaps inboard of the trailing-edge flaps, where the wing meets the blended body section. The is likely a temporary configuration and a gap-filler would fill this section. A slot-like low-observable platypus engine exhaust, with the nozzle fully concealed from most angles of view is also visible. Engine exhausts are among the most notoriously complicated elements of developing any stealth aircraft, crewed or uncrewed, something that we have seen played out in the development of the Russian S-70 Okhotnik-B, or Hunter-B, UCAV, another flying wing design with clear stealth aspirations. Interestingly, the CH-7 in its latest form bears a striking resemblance to at least some unofficial artwork of the U.S. Air Force’s secretive so-called RQ-180, a high-altitude, long-endurance stealth drone that you can read more about here. While we know very little about the RQ-180 — even its designation is unconfirmed — it’s almost certainly a large, flying-wing aircraft with slender wings and an overall design based around very low-observable (stealth) requirements. Just Fancy That pic.twitter.com/f9EWmP3y0x&mdash; Bill Sweetman (@ValkStrategy) November 8, 2024 Back in 2018, a corporate video from CASC said that the CH-7 was due to begin flight tests in 2019, with production to commence by 2022 although it’s unclear is either of these targets was met. On the other hand, it could also be the case that the imagery released today dates back several years. Earlier this year, Chinese state-owned media reported that the CH-7 had completed testing and was scheduled to complete development in 2024. This would suggest that it had also completed the flight-test program, something we’re yet to see evidence of. China has meanwhile been busy with a growing portfolio of stealthy drones, developing new ones as well as refining the low-observable characteristics of existing platforms like the GJ-11 Sharp Sword, testing of which continues apace. But the CH-7 program is of particular interest since it is concerned with a UCAV that’s apparently designed to penetrate deep into hostile airspace at high altitudes. According to official statements, it should also be able to strike strategic targets, as well as bring back critical intelligence. The GJ-11 in its revised, more stealthy form, while on parade in October 2019. China Military When it was unveiled, the CH-7 was described as a high-altitude, long-endurance stealth combat drone, its chief designer Shi Wen saying that the aircraft would be able to 'fly long hours, scout, and strike the target when necessary.' However, in its current iteration, the ISR mission appears to be the primary one. This is backed up by the high-altitude specification, which would make the drone ideal for peering into very high defended areas — and also strike targets of opportunity if configured to do so. A production version of the CH-7 would also appear to have particular relevance in a naval context, as it could range far out over the Pacific, keeping tabs on enemy ships and providing targeting data for ground-based long-range missiles, for example, as well as missile-toting warships and bombers. An inert air-launched antis-hip ballistic missile missiles under the wing of a Chinese H-6K bomber. via Chinese internet Once again, this underscores the fact that China has embraced the concept of very stealthy uncrewed aircraft for independent strike missions, a category of platform that is, as far as we know, absent from the U.S. military. You can read all about the implications of this reality in this special feature of ours. While the CH-7 will very likely find a place within the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) order of battle, it’s also very noteworthy that the design — like the rest of the diverse Caihong series — has also been pitched for export. It isn't clear if this enlarged variant would still be up for international sale, but if it is, it would offer a capability nobody else is selling on the advanced arms market. In the past, and despite questions being raised about the quality of certain Chinese drone exports, Beijing has firmly established itself as a major global purveyor of uncrewed air vehicles, including armed ones. Another view of the original CH-7 mockup at Zhuhai in 2018. via Chinese Internet China’s ambitious positioning — and its undoubted commercial success — in this regard is all the more significant when we consider the export restrictions placed on this kind of technology by the United States. In particular, the Missile Technology Control Regime limits the exports of missiles and other uncrewed vehicles, meaning that armed versions of the MQ-9 Reaper family, for example, are only sold to the closest U.S. allies. The United States, and other Western nations, are not currently able to offer for export a stealthy UCAV like the CH-7, even if the political conditions were met. For China, this is not a problem, although we don’t know exactly how long it will take to complete development of the CH-7, much less get it into the hands of a potential customer. On the other hand, the CH-7 is a drone that’s an entirely different scale to those China has exported before, with much more advanced capabilities, which might also limit such opportunities and China may keep its sensitive capabilities to itself. It is also possible a less capable and possibly smaller variant could be offered for export. Whatever the status of the CH-7 program at this point, it remains highly intriguing, with the potential to provide China with a class of multi-role drone that may well not have any other direct competitor. Above all else imagery of the drone provides yet more evidence of the China’s rapid pace of development when it comes to stealthy unmanned aircraft as well as drones of all types.

MQ-20 Avenger First Drone Flown Using Navy’s Carrier-Based Contro...	The U.S. Navy recently used a drone control system now being installed on all its supercarriers to operate an actual uncrewed aircraft for the first time. The uncrewed platform in question was a stealthy General Atomics Avenger, which that company has been using as a technology testbed to support its work on autonomy and Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) type drones. This underscores the Navy's plans to use the Unmanned Carrier Aviation Mission Control System (UMCS) to support more than just the MQ-25 Stingray tanker drone, which is still set to be the service's first operational advanced uncrewed carrier-based aircraft. Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) announced the successful completion of the test, which took place on November 5, in a press release earlier today. Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works advanced projects division, which has long been involved in the development of the UMCS, participated in the event along with General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. (GA-ASI). Navy Air Vehicle Pilots conduct a test run to monitor the Unmanned Carrier Aviation Mission Control System ground control station, located at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Md., as the system commands the General Atomics Avenger surrogate, located at the company’s test facility in California, in preparation for the November 5 demonstration event. USN 'Navy Air Vehicle Pilots (AVPs) at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland controlled the MQ-20 [Avenger] during its flight from GA-ASI’s test site in California,' according to NAVAIR's release. 'The UMCS connected Beyond Line of Site (BLOS) to the MQ-20 via a proliferated low Earth orbit (pLEO) satellite constellation and transmitted flight control commands and received mission systems data.' 'This flight was the first time a GA-ASI UAS completed bi-directional communications using the UMCS operation codes while performing autonomous behavior,' per a separate release from General Atomics. The company also said the Avenger leveraged its Tactical Autonomy Core Ecosystem (TacACE) software to fly in a semi-autonomous mode during the test. Avengers have been heavily involved in the testing of different artificial intelligence-driven autonomy systems over the years. The core component of the Navy's UMCS is the MD-5E ground control station, which includes an array of monitors, tablet-like devices, and other computer hardware. The central element on the software side is Skunk Works' Multi Domain Combat System (MDCX). Other ancillary elements make up the complete 'system of systems.' As already noted, UMCS is in the process of being integrated onto all of the Navy's Nimitz and Ford class supercarriers as part of the addition of a dedicated Unmanned Air Warfare Center (UAWC) on those ships. In August, NAVAIR announced that the Nimitz class USS George H.W. Bush had become the first flattop to get the full UAWC. A view from inside USS George H.W. Bush‘s new UAWC. USN The development of the MD-5 and the rest of the UMCS, as well as the UAWC, traces all the way back to the abortive Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) effort that then eventually evolved into the MQ-25 program. The development of the Stingray has been beset by issues, but the Navy is still pushing ahead with plans to buy 76 of the drone tankers. The MQ-25 is currently set to be the first operational carrier-based drone in the Navy's inventory starting in 2026. The drones are set to be attached to E-2 Hawkeye airborne early warning and control aircraft squadrons within carrier air wings, at least initially. The Stingrays will be a critical tool for extending the reach of future carrier air wings, as well as eliminating the need for F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighters to fly in the tanker role. The critical importance of increasing the range of the service's carrier-based crewed tactical jets just recently re-emerged with a separate call for ways to extend the unrefueled combat radius of the F/A-18E/Fs. The Stingrays will also have secondary intelligence, reconnaissance, and surveillance (ISR) capabilities, and giving them more roles and missions, including stand-off strike, could be on the horizon. At the same time, the Navy has been consisting in stressing how its work on the UMCS is a stepping stone adding even more uncrewed capabilities to its carrier air wings. 'UMCS is laying a foundation that will enable control of all unmanned carrier aircraft, starting with the MQ-25 aircraft,' Capt. Daniel Fucito, head of NAVAIR’s Unmanned Carrier Aviation office, or PMA-268, said in a statement following the November 5 test. 'The UMCS opens the door for efficiently introducing future unmanned systems into the complex carrier command and control architecture.' 'The Navy will use data from the demonstration to refine the program’s requirements and develop key command and control technologies,' the release also notes. 'The team plans to conduct additional digital and live surrogate test flights to demonstrate autonomy, mission systems, crewed-uncrewed teaming, advanced communications and further command and control development.' All of this is further underscored by the use of MQ-20 in this first-of-its-kind UMCS demonstration rather than Boeing's flying Stingray test asset, referred to as T1. The Navy is still ironing out its plans for a fleet of CCA-type drones that will operate in close cooperation, at least initially, with crewed elements of the carrier air wing. However, the service has laid out a vision in the past for CCAs that are cheap enough to be 'consumable,' and expended as one-way kamikaze drones or aerial targets for training or testing use at the end of relatively short service lives. You can read more about those plans here. Overall, the Navy has a stated goal of at least 60 percent of the aircraft in its future air wings being uncrewed. The Navy's CCA work is also directly interviewed with that of the U.S. Air Force, as well as related work the U.S. Marine Corps is doing, especially when it comes to interoperable control architectures. The expectation then is that UMCS will be among the systems able to exercise control over drones owned by other services, as required. It's also worth noting here that General Atomics is one of two companies (the other being Anduril) that are developing drones as part of the initial phase, or Increment 1, of the Air Force's CCA program. General Atomics is also now working on a carrier-based member of its Gambit family of drones, also known as Gambit 5, as well as other carrier-capable designs. The company has been pitching these designs to a number of navies around the world. A rendering of a notional catapult-equipped HMS Prince of Wales with an air wing that includes Gambit 5s and carrier-capable MQ-9 Reaper variants. General Atomics Questions are emerging about the Navy's ability to realize its future uncrewed and crewed carrier aviation ambitions. The MQ-25's troubles have led to significant delays and cost growth. Earlier this year, the service announced its intention to push back the timeline for a new sixth-generation stealth crewed carrier-based combat jet, or F/A-XX, and the potential for significant budget cuts to that program has since come up. The Navy is in the process of selecting a final design now and is still hoping to have F/A-XXs begin entering operational service in the 2030s. This also comes as the Air Force has been issuing increasingly dire warnings in public about its ability to afford various big-ticket modernization programs, including its own new sixth-generation 'fighter,' CCA drones, and stealth tankers, which you can read more about in detail here. The entire U.S. military seems to be in the midst of a certain amount of upheaval over modernization priorities amid fears of at best largely flat budgets in the coming years. In the meantime, the Navy is clearly pushing ahead with work on the UMCS to lay the groundwork for new drones in its carrier air wings, whatever that mix of uncrewed platforms might ultimately look like.

What Trump’s Election Could Mean For The War In Ukraine	Over the course of his presidency, Joe Biden vowed to back Ukraine for as long as it took to defeat Russia. So far, his administration has doled out over $61 billion in military aid to Kyiv, with scores of packages including advanced air defense systems and munitions, millions of artillery shells, hundreds of armored vehicles, and much more. President-elect Donald J. Trump has vowed a very different approach to how the U.S. will deal with the nearly three-year-old all-out war, raising concerns that he could abandon Ukraine. On the campaign trail, Trump lambasted his predecessor's approach, chiding Biden for providing arms free of charge. Above all else, he repeatedly touted his ability to quickly end the conflict, even if it means Ukraine conceding much of the nearly 20 percent of its territory Russia has captured going back to the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Moreover, Vice President-elect JD Vance has repeatedly expressed his disdain for the open-ended support to Ukraine, saying it should be greatly dialed back. 24 hours have passed. The war continues in Ukraine pic.twitter.com/6h02WBIwzj&mdash; MilitaryNewsUA (@front_ukrainian) November 7, 2024 Trump, who was the first president to provide Ukraine with lethal aid in the form of FGM-148 Javelin advanced anti-tank missiles, has yet to provide details of his peace plan. However, it is reported that those close to him have ideas that include freezing the front lines as they are, and getting Ukraine to promise not to join NATO for at least 20 years in return for a promise to continue arming Ukraine to deter future Russian attacks, according to The Wall Street Journal. 'Under that plan, the front line would essentially lock in place and both sides would agree to an 800-mile demilitarized zone,' the publication proffered. 'Who would police that territory remains unclear, but one adviser said the peacekeeping force wouldn’t involve American troops, nor come from a U.S.-funded international body, such as the United Nations.' Despite these looming changes, some Ukrainians are hopeful about America's new leadership. Even though the Biden administration is scrambling to ship over $6 billion remaining in Ukraine security assistance funds out the door by Inauguration Day, there is growing resentment about its slow delivery of arms and restrictions preventing long-range weapons from being used deep inside Russia. That anger is exacerbated by concerns that billions in new equipment won't arrive before Trump takes office, raising questions about whether it might be cut off under a new administration.

(Photo by Fermin Torrano/Anadolu via Getty Images) Anadolu President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly argued that an exchange of land for peace is off the table. However, his congratulatory message contained a sentiment expressed by some in Ukraine that Trump's leadership style could actually benefit Kyiv. 'I appreciate President Trump’s commitment to the 'peace through strength' approach in global affairs,' said Zelensky. 'This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer. I am hopeful that we will put it into action together. We look forward to an era of a strong United States of America under President Trump’s decisive leadership. We rely on continued strong bipartisan support for Ukraine in the United States.' Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump on his impressive election victory! I recall our great meeting with President Trump back in September, when we discussed in detail the Ukraine-U.S. strategic partnership, the Victory Plan, and ways to put an end to Russian aggression against…&mdash; Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa) November 6, 2024 The prospect of a second Trump administration is not as alarming as some critics have suggested, a former Zelensky administration official recently posited. 'With the announcement of the U.S. presidential election results, social media predictably erupted in drama, particularly concerning Ukraine’s future,' former Zelensky press secretary Iuliia Mendel wrote Wednesday in an opinion piece for the Kyiv Post. 'Many experts and journalists have been convinced that Donald Trump's presidency would spell disaster for Ukraine. However, the reality is far more sober than social media drama: neither candidate offered a clear win for Ukraine.' Trump’s clearest stance on Ukraine 'was his call to end the war,' she continued. 'Many interpreted this as a veiled call for capitulation, but the truth is more nuanced. That message resonates deeply with a less vocal group of Ukrainians – those enduring daily bombardments, whose lives have been reduced to an unending cycle of destruction since Russia’s full-scale invasion.' 'A purely military solution has never been a viable path to victory for Ukraine, even with unlimited Western financial and military support,' Mendel argued. 'This is not a critique of our armed forces – our soldiers, both professional and civilian, have shown extraordinary bravery and resilience in defending democracy against Russian tyranny. However, we must confront the sobering reality: the cost of this war is steadily eroding the very foundation of the Ukrainian nation.' Donald Trump Will Be President: Let’s Not Dramatize Iuliia Mendel (@IuliiaMendel) November 6, 2024 The War Zone reached out to some Ukrainians and subject matter experts for their take on what a new Trump presidency will mean for their future. Their responses range from concern that Trump's previous pro-Putin rhetoric is a sign that he might abandon Ukraine to cautious optimism that he won't, with the focus being on ending the war. 'Based on what happened in the first Trump administration and all the things that he has said in the past four years, yes, of course, I'd be concerned,' retired three-star general and former commander of U.S. Army Europe Ben Hodges told The War Zone. 'There's constant praise for Vladimir Putin,' Hodges, one of Ukraine's staunchest supporters in the U.S., said. 'Remember when Putin [launched] the large-scale invasion, Trump said how smart that was. Instead of saying anything positive about Ukraine, he never criticized the Kremlin for what they were doing. So that was the main thing about it that gives me such concern.' Aside from praising Putin, Trump has repeatedly insulted Zelensky. On the flip side, there are reasons why Trump would want to keep backing Ukraine, Hodges surmised. Hodges added that he sees potential for Trump to change his tune. He explained that he hopes pro-Ukrainian Republicans like U.S. Senators Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and U.S. Representatives Mike Turner of Ohio and Joe Wilson of South Carolina can convince Trump to maintain support for Kyiv. 'I think that Mr. Trump has no interest in having the blame for losing Ukraine placed on him. And so I think people that care about Ukraine should appeal to the president to say, 'look, you're going to own this,'' Hodges argued. 'Nobody in the world believes for one second that Russia will live up to any agreement. And so I think it's in the interest of the new president to make a very clear statement about how important protecting Ukraine is for civilian security around the world.' At the moment, Russia does not have the ability to completely overrun Ukraine, said Hodges. 'The only way that happens is if we just quit' backing Ukraine, he suggested. Not everyone in Ukraine is alarmed by another Trump term in the White House. 'Ukrainians are very happy' to see Trump prevail over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, Oleksandr V. Danylyuk, chairman of the Center for Defense Reforms and former special advisor to the head of Ukraine’s foreign intelligence service told The War Zone on Wednesday. The reason, he stated, is that Trump 'will let the Russians understand that the U.S. is going to be great again and is not going to tolerate any attempt to destroy the world order. Either Putin calms down or Ukraine will get everything to finish the job.' Trump will not be as cautious as Biden when it comes to allowing long-range weapons like U.S.-produced Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) short-range ballistic missiles to be fired deep into Russia beyond the border areas, Danylyuk forecasted. 'What is the difference for the U.S. if you are not scared,' he asked rhetorically. 'And Trump is definitely not scared.' The next Trump administration could lift restrictions against using weapons like ATACMS deep inside Russia, a Ukrainian official suggested. (US Army) US Army Negotiations that would see Ukraine give up land for peace are not new, a Ukrainian political strategist highlighted. 'Let’s be honest, conversations like these have been happening in Washington behind closed doors, without the press, for quite some time,' Kateryna Odarchenko told The War Zone. 'I’m not specifically referring to the plan [as described by The Wall Street Journal], but similar concepts have been discussed since the second year of the war. I’m not in a position to say whether this is good or bad at this stage.' Taking the pulse of how Ukrainians feel about the election results 'requires separating the sentiments of political elites from those of the general public,' she added. 'Ordinary Ukrainian voters, like voters everywhere, do not deeply analyze geopolitical processes.' As for the political elites, 'they are undoubtedly in a state of caution, leaning more toward negativity than optimism,' explained Odarchenko, a partner in the SIC Group USA and leader of the PolitA Institute for Democracy and Development. 'The dialogue with Democrats has been more straightforward in the past. Additionally, during the election campaign, billions were spent not on discussing substantive issues but on message boxes that tend to generalize and polarize, including on topics related to Ukraine.' Ukrainians 'view Americans as friends,' she explained while pointing out that no definitive studies have yet been conducted on the nation's sentiment toward a new Trump administration. 'However, there is also a sense of caution and misunderstanding regarding the Trump administration.' A new administration only adds to the political headwinds faced by Zelensky, she noted. 'For Zelensky, any scenario is fraught with challenges,' Odarchenko suggested. 'Economically, the country was already struggling before the war, but now the situation is even more severe. Furthermore, the mobilized population, after such a prolonged conflict, understandably expects clear answers and a coherent plan for the future — though this is something military experts are better equipped to address.' Another aspect to consider 'is the position of Zelensky’s political opponents, who are largely in a state of waiting rather than actively challenging him,' Odarchenko expressed. 'However, any shifts in U.S. or EU policy, or potential negotiations, could lead to their increased activity. At that point, we might see more discussions about internal issues such as the need for reforms — particularly anti-corruption reforms — and other critical topics that could become highly contentious following difficult negotiations.'

(Photo by Uliana Boichuk/Novyny LIVE/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images) Global Images Ukraine One Ukrainian defense expert we spoke with sees Trump's election as a positive development. Trump 'will be good for Ukraine,' said the expert, because, 'after three years of war, we are not seeing formidable results. The U.S. strategy should be adjusted for the current situation on the battlefield.' His comments come as Russian forces are pressing forward in the eastern part of Ukraine. Though Moscow is paying a heavy price in manpower and equipment, it also is seeking to recruit an additional 30,000 troops a month. That's augmented by some 12,000 North Korean troops who are in Russia to help fight Ukraine, a figure that could rise significantly given Pyongyang's massive army. In an effort to keep pace, Ukraine is looking to draft an additional 160,000 troops into its armed forces, 'which will raise the manning of units to 85%,' National Security and Defense Council Secretary Oleksandr Lytvynenko said on Oct. 29 during a session of the Ukrainian parliament. Still, if the current status quo persists, every day the Russian onslaught continues, Ukraine finds itself in a more precarious state. 'We are in a stalemate, leaning toward Russia, just depleting resources, including human resources,' the expert added. 'We have less manpower while Russia has adjusted its economy to produce more weapons. They relocated major supplies like oil and gas and are self-sustainable. Not like Ukraine depends on 75 percent foreign financing.' A pause in fighting now, he surmised, could ultimately lead to a situation like the one in post-World War II divided Germany, where it took four decades to finally put all the pieces back together and reunify.

(Photo by Ukrinform/NurPhoto via Getty Images) NurPhoto While the Trump administration could drastically reduce the spigot of arms flowing to Ukraine, the expert sees some silver linings. Such a move would pressure European allies to step up and do more. It also opens the door for Ukrainian defense contractors to provide more arms not just domestically, but internationally as well. Greater reliance on its indigenous industry could be a 'win-win,' the expert told us. 'This could be a situation for private industry in Ukraine to earn more money while protecting the motherland,' he said. Trump has also sparked worry that he could pull out of NATO if its members didn't increase funding. Earlier this year, he said he would encourage Russia to do 'whatever the hell they want' to any NATO member country that doesn’t meet spending guidelines on defense 'in a stunning admission he would not abide by the collective-defense clause at the heart of the alliance if reelected,' CNN reported at the time. 'NATO was busted until I came along,' Trump said at a rally in Conway, South Carolina. 'I said, ‘Everybody’s gonna pay.’ They said, ‘Well, if we don’t pay, are you still going to protect us?’ I said, ‘Absolutely not.’ They couldn’t believe the answer.' Those comments sparked outrage from allies. 'Any attack on NATO will be met with a united and forceful response,' then-NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement. 'Any suggestion that allies will not defend each other undermines all of our security, including that of the US, and puts American and European soldiers at increased risk.' European Council President Charles Michel 'described comments from Trump on NATO 'reckless,' adding they 'serve only Putin’s interest,'' the network reported. Still, in his congratulatory message, new NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte praised Trump for pushing NATO allies to spend more on defense. 'President-elect Trump demonstrated strong U.S. leadership throughout his first term in office – a term that turned the tide on European defense spending, improved transatlantic burden sharing, and strengthened Alliance capabilities,' Rutte wrote. When President-elect Trump takes office again on January 20, he will be welcomed by a stronger, larger, and more united Alliance. Two-thirds of Allies now spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense, and defense spending and production are on an onward trajectory across the Alliance.' However, he has also pointed out that an undeterred Russia that wins in Ukraine is a massive threat to NATO members. 'If Russia would be successful in Ukraine, you would have an emboldened Russia at our border&#8230;,' he recently told reporters. Likewise, Poland's Foreign Affairs Minister noted the importance of European allies doing more to support Ukraine and themselves. 'The American people have voted,' Radek Sikorski stated. 'I am in regular contact with top security officials from both parties. Europe urgently needs to take more responsibility for its security. The winds of history are blowing ever more strongly. Poland's leadership will rise to the occasion.' The American people have voted.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday congratulated Trump, saying he welcomed the chance for warmer relations. 'What has been said about the desire to restore relations with Russia, to help bring the Ukrainian crisis to an end, I think that's worthy of attention, at the very least,' he stated. 'And I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate him on his election as president of the United States.'

Russian parliamentarians don't see much change in the wind. 'I think that Trump will offer Russia a deliberately unfavorable deal on Ukraine before January, which we will, of course, reject,' said Russian member of parliament Yevgeny Popov. 'Donald will throw up his hands and, in his usual manner, announce an unprecedented aid package for the Zelensky regime and the lifting of all restrictions on missiles. This will not change anything either. But it will delay the settlement process. Glory to the Russian soldier!' Russian MP Popov commented on US election results. He thinks that Donald Trump will lift all restrictions on long-range weapons.Russia is worried.Trabslation of Popov's post:'I think that Trump will offer Russia a deliberately unfavorable deal on Ukraine before January,… pic.twitter.com/NVJnVVlp8a&mdash; Anton Gerashchenko (@Gerashchenko_en) November 6, 2024 Konstantin Kosachev, deputy speaker of Russia’s upper house of parliament, also expressed doubt that Trump will offer a dramatic departure from Biden when it comes to bilateral relations. 'It would be extremely naive to believe that under Trump, as he promises, peace in Ukraine will suddenly become closer,' he proclaimed on Telegram. 'The Ukrainian conflict has only one simple solution – Russia’s victory, which the U.S. will not want under any president. The other solutions are complex, although the U.S. can indeed influence them, since the Kyivv – and Brussels – regimes depend on them.' Meanwhile, Russian propagandist Alexander Dugin declared Trump's election a victory for Russia. 'So we have won,' he said on Twitter. 'That is decisive. The world will be never ever like before. Globalists have lost their final combat. The future is finally open. I am really happy.' So we have won. That is decisive. The world will be never ever like before. Globalists have lost their final combat. The future is finally open. I am really happy.&mdash; Alexander Dugin (@Agdchan) November 6, 2024 A lot will change over the next few months. Trump will select a new defense secretary and a new national security advisor among his other cabinet choices. We should also see more clarity about exactly what the proposed peace treaty espoused by the soon-to-be 47th president will entail. Having majorities in both the Senate and House will make whatever agenda he chooses easier to become reality. Still, a deal with Russia may be far more difficult than Trump envisions. There are major concerns that Trump will hold out aid to Ukraine unless it agrees to a deal it does not want to make. And then there is also the issue of where the U.S. relationship with NATO would go if Trump decides to stop supporting Ukraine's fight for whatever reason. A major fissure could form as a result after the alliance has come together in its support of Ukraine to a degree many thought was impossible. Above all else, if a peace deal isn't realized, the question of what happens next is arguably is the most glaring concern. So far Trump has not addressed that very real possibility.

EP-3E Aries II Spy Plane Has Flown Its Last Operational Mission	Another long-serving U.S. military aircraft has completed its final operational deployment, with the return of the U.S. Navy’s EP-3E Aries II surveillance platform from the 5th Fleet area of operations. The countdown to the spy plane’s final retirement is now on, which will see its vital intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) mission handed over to the P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol plane, the MQ-4C Triton high-altitude, long-endurance drone, and other assets, including ones in space. The last EP-3E deployed on operations was Bureau Number, or BuNo 159893, which completed its final flight in the U.S. 5th Fleet area of operations on October 29. The aircraft then made a homecoming to its base at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Washington, according to the Facebook account of Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron 1 (VQ-1), the 'World Watchers,' which posted photos of the event yesterday. Ground crew welcome EP-3E BuNo 159893 on its return to Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Washington. VQ-1/Facebook The U.S. 5th Fleet area of operations covers approximately 2.5 million square miles of water and includes the Arabian Gulf, Red Sea, Gulf of Oman, as well as parts of the Indian Ocean. The area includes three highly strategic choke points at the Strait of Hormuz, the Suez Canal, and the Strait of Bab el-Mandeb at the southern tip of Yemen. The tense security situation in the region at the moment saw the EP-3E’s final operational deployment extended.

U.S. Navy Commander, Naval Air Forces Originally, the U.S. Navy had scheduled VQ-1 to cease operations by September 30, 2024, ahead of the formal deactivation of the unit on March 31, 2025. According to the VQ-1 Facebook account, the squadron was first ordered to delay the cessation of operations until October 8, 2024, after which it was required to continue its missions in the region until an undetermined date. EP-3E BuNo 159893 prepares to take flight within the U.S. 5th Fleet area of operation. U.S. Navy Commander, Naval Air Forces Another VQ-1 EP-3E that had been deployed also recently returned to Whidbey Island, with photos of that aircraft’s homecoming posted by the unit on November 4. This was BuNo 161410 that had been operating from Souda Bay, on the Greek island of Crete, under U.S. Central Command. For some time now, the Navy has been sending EP-3Es into retirement, delivering them to the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona, for storage. As we reported last month, the most famous EP-3E of all — BuNo 156511, which was involved in a collision with a Chinese J-8 interceptor over Hainan Island in 2001 — has been moved from the AMARG boneyard to go on public display in the future at the Pima Air & Space Museum in Tucson, Arizona. EP-3E Aries II BuNo 156511 is towed to the Pima Air &#038; Space Museum last month. Pima Air &#038; Space Museum Pima Air &#038; Space Museum Meanwhile, the end of the EP-3’s operational commitment after nearly six decades of service has been commemorated by the Navy. A press release from the service included recollections from EP-3E crew members, providing a rare glimpse into a highly secretive community, and one with a very sensitive mission. 'It’s amazing to think of the number of folks who have been part of the EP-3 heritage over the last 55 years,' said Lt. Cmdr. Justin 'Gump' Roberts, the VQ-1 detachment officer-in-charge. 'Success in this platform has solely been because of our hard-working maintenance team while on deck and our aircrew’s superior ISR while on station. It’s an honor to be part of a legacy that’s bigger than the sum of its parts.' The aircraft commander at VQ-1, Lt. Bradford 'Chad' Holcombe, added that he was 'tremendously grateful' to be part of the EP-3E’s history. 'From my first day at VQ-1, it’s been obvious to see the pride each member has in the platform, the mission, and most importantly the effort it takes to execute wherever and whenever we’re asked,' he said. 'Flying the last mission flight is a privilege.' 240928-N-AC117-1132 (Sept. 28, 2024) A U.S. Navy EP-3E Airborne Reconnaissance Integrated Electronic System (ARIES) II, assigned to the 'World Watchers' of Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron 1 (VQ-1), transits within the U.S. 5th Fleet area of operation. Commander, Naval Air Forces Finally, words were offered by Capt. Dennis 'Rudy' Jensen, Commodore of Task Force 57: 'My father was a P-3 pilot during the Cold War, and I’ve flown the variants of the same aircraft since 2002. Few other airplanes are as ‘time-tested and mother approved’ as the P-3,' Jensen said. 'Its longevity and ability to operate from remote locations in austere environments for over half a century is a testament to those who designed, built, maintained, and operated it. Much like the ever-changing platforms onboard the flight deck of an aircraft carrier, the mission systems inside the EP-3E have evolved over time. The ability to evolve has enabled the EP-3E to remain viable and effective through today.' During its time in operational service, the EP-3E played a fairly covert role as a central intelligence-gathering asset within the Navy’s Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Force (MPRF). Derived from the P-3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft, the EP-3E was optimized for operations in the maritime/littoral domain. It was packed with equipment to gather real-time tactical signals intelligence (SIGINT), including intercepting communications and locating and classifying emitters, especially those related to hostile air defense systems. The cabin of the preserved EP-3E BuNo 156511 as it appears now. Pima Air &#038; Space Museum A typical EP-3E comprised six flight crew and a reconnaissance crew of 18, who would be drawn from the Navy, Marines, and Air Force. Data could be processed and analyzed onboard by the crew, then fused together with other critical information. The resulting ‘product,’ including full-motion video intelligence, could be provided in near real-time to fleet and theater commanders. Overall, the EP-3E was able to provide commanders with specific indications and warnings, as well as build a better picture of the battlespace for situational awareness. Intelligence it gathered on air defense systems would be potentially vital for suppression of enemy air defenses and destruction of enemy air defenses, while other information would be used for anti-air warfare and anti-submarine warfare applications. Successive upgrades ensured that the EP-3E remained a valuable asset and also added new capabilities. While it was primarily a SIGINT platform in the early years, it later became a ‘multi-intelligence reconnaissance aircraft,’ with new equipment that could hoover up a variety of electronic emissions including at long standoff range.

U.S. Department of Defense PH3 FRANKLIN P. CALL, USN The EP-3E’s mission saw it operate in various high-threat areas throughout its career. As well as around the coasts of China — which led to the Hainan Island Incident — regular areas of interest included the Mediterranean Sea, the Middle East, and the Caribbean. In the process, intercepts by hostile or potentially hostile fighters were commonplace. The video below shows an encounter between an EP-3E and a Russian Su-27 Flanker fighter jet over the Black Sea, in 2018. On that occasion, the Navy says the jet came within five feet of the surveillance aircraft, causing a mission abort, and return to base. Replacing the EP-3E with the MQ-4C has been a gradual process. Tritons have been operating from forward deployment bases in Guam in the Pacific and Sigonella in the Mediterranean, for some time. Most recently, a third Triton deployment base was established in the U.S. 5th Fleet area of operations, on October 1, allowing the EP-3E to stand down from its duties there. A Navy MQ-4C Triton drone arrives at NAS Sigonella in Italy on March 30, 2024. U.S. Navy Flying at a higher altitude and offering a longer endurance than the EP-3E, the MQ-4C offers some significant advantages. While a multi-mission platform, it’s the Triton’s so-called Multi-Intelligence (Multi-Int) configuration with additional electronic and signals intelligence capabilities that will take over from the EP-3E. Since it’s uncrewed, there is also no risk to the crew, something that EP-3E operators were exposed to on a fairly regular basis. Despite this, in 2022 the Navy decided to dramatically reduce its total planned purchases of MQ-4Cs from 70 to 27. This came after increased questions about the drone’s survivability after one of the interim Broad Area Maritime Surveillance Demonstrator (BAMS-D) aircraft was shot down by Iran in 2019. Some of the EP-3E’s missions will also be taken over by the P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft. The baseline Poseidon has a signals intelligence capability, allowing it to detect, geolocate, and classify emissions, including from radars and other air defense nodes, which is also now set to be upgraded. Some P-8s are configured to carry other intelligence-gathering payloads, such as the AN/APS-154 Advanced Airborne Sensor, as well. Boeing has internally funded the development of a modular multi-mission gondola-like pod for Poseidon, which is set to offer an additional way to relatively rapidly integrate sensors and other capabilities. A U.S. Navy P-8A carrying the AN/APS-154 Advanced Airborne Sensor (AAS), a powerful and secretive radar system mounted in an elongated pontoon-like pod under the fuselage. cvvhrn 'The transition from the EP-3E to the P-8A Poseidon and MQ-4C Triton platforms has been carefully planned to avoid capability gaps,' the Navy says. 'These platforms offer enhanced intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities, with greater range, endurance, and the ability to operate in more complex environments.' The Navy will also be able to leverage other emerging U.S. military ISR assets, including new spaced-based surveillance capabilities. While the EP-3E’s time is now nearly up, there remain a handful of other Orion variants still in U.S. Navy service. These include P-3C, NP-3C, and NP-3D aircraft flown by Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 30 (VX-30) at Naval Air Station Point Mugu, California, and by Scientific Development Squadron One (VXS-1) at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland. Many of these are also in the process of being replaced. While many secrets of the EP-3’s exploits are still to be revealed, there’s little doubt that this platform made an enormous contribution to gathering intelligence from hotspots around the globe during its long and eventful period of service.

Massive Chinese Anti-Drone High-Power Microwave Weapon Emerges	A huge truck-mounted system is one of at least three large mobile ground-based high-power microwave directed energy weapons, primarily intended to down drones, at this year's Zhuhai Airshow. This underscores a global explosion of demand for counter-drone capabilities, as well as China's steady progress in the development, fielding, and exporting of microwave and laser directed energy weapons. Officially known as the China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition, the Zhuhai Airshow also provides an opportunity for Chinese and foreign companies to showcase ground-based and maritime offerings. Pictures and videos of various aircraft and other systems have been steadily emerging ahead of the event's formal opening next week. The imagery that has appeared online already amid the Zhuhai preparations includes a promotional video from state-run firms China South Industries Group Corporation (CSGC) and Norinco that features footage of two high-power microwave directed energy weapons, as well as other air defense systems.

America's armed forces are actively pursuing a number of ground and ship-based systems. However, there has been a notable new clamor among armed forces globally, including the U.S. military, to expand their abilities to defend against uncrewed aerial threats in recent years. The ongoing war in Ukraine, which has become heavily defined by drone use by both sides at all levels, from long-range strikes to kamikaze attacks on forces right on the front lines, has been the primary driver. Increasing uncrewed aerial system use in other conflicts, including ones in and around the Middle East, have been contributing factors, too. How a microwave directed energy weapon focuses its beam, along with its power levels, affect its maximum effective range and how many threats it can engage at once. However, the beams are typically relatively broad, especially compared to laser directed energy weapons, which also helps get on target faster. They are also often less impacted by environmental factors. As such, high-power microwave-based systems present a particularly attractive option for defeating large volumes of threats, including drones operating as part of fully networked swarms, an additional concern that is only set to grow in the future. Microwave energy, which can disrupt or even destroy a range of electronic systems, presents a threat to other types of targets in the air and down below, including cruise missiles, as well. On the counter-drone front, China is well aware of the ever-growing threat ecosystem given its own substantial and still expanding investments in the development and fielding of various tiers of uncrewed aerial systems, as well as swarming capabilities, which are also on display at Zhuhai. The country has also been making steady progress in work on directed energy capabilities, including multiple existing ground-based types. The microwave directed energy and other systems that will be on display at Zhuhai highlight an additional export dimension, as well. China has already sold directed energy counter-drone systems abroad. Just in October, a Chinese laser directed energy weapon appeared in the Iranian capital Tehran during a high-profile appearance by Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Though it remains unclear what other capabilities were deployed to protect the Iranian Supreme Leader, The War Zone noted at the time that images from the event showed what looked to be a planar array as is commonly seen on microwave-based systems. An annotated image showing a Chinese laser directed energy counter-drone system (highlighted inside the red box) deployed in Tehran in October 2024. To the left, a system with what looks to be a planar array is also visible. via X It is important to stress that the real capabilities of any these Chinese systems are unclear. At the same time, China has been steadily working to get those systems into at least some level of operational use while the U.S. military has notably lagged in doing so on and off traditional battlefields. When it comes to domestic drone defense considerations, American armed forces are also notably not interested at all currently in directed energy weapons, or more traditional kinetic effectors like surface-to-air missiles or guns, due in large part to legal and regulatory issues that you can read about more here. In the meantime, China's continued high-power microwave and laser directed energy developments look set to be an especially significant part of this year's Zhuhai airshow.

Israel Executes Long Awaited Buy Of F-15IA Advanced Eagle Fighter...	Israel will buy 25 F-15IA fighters, marking the first new Eagles that the country has acquired since November 1995, when it ordered F-15I Ra’am jets. This summer, Israel had been given U.S. approval to buy as many as 50 F-15IAs, as well as upgrade its F-15Is as part of an overall package valued at $18.82 billion that you can read about here. Whether more F-15s or upgrades are added, the current wars in the Middle East mean that further acquisitions of combat aircraft are likely. The Israeli Ministry of Defense announced today that it was buying the 25 F-15IAs at a cost of $5.2 billion. The ministry signed the contract with manufacturer Boeing yesterday, noting that an option remains to buy the other 25 jets. An earlier Boeing graphic showing a heavily armed F-15IA. Boeing The Israeli Ministry of Defense confirmed that deliveries of the F-15IAs will start in 2031, with between four and six aircraft being supplied annually. 'This procurement marks a significant milestone in deepening the defense cooperation between Israel and the United States, reflecting their mutual commitment to regional security,' the Israeli Ministry of Defense said on X.

Eyal Zamir; the head of the Israeli Ministry of Defense’s Mission to the U.S., Aviram Hasson; and the Senior Deputy Head of the Mission, Offer Zavatzky, during the signing of the F-15IA deal yesterday. Israel Ministry of Defense 'The new F-15IA will be equipped with cutting-edge weapon systems, including state-of-the-art Israeli technologies,' the ministry added. 'The upgraded aircraft will feature enhanced range capabilities, increased payload capacity, and improved performance across various operational scenarios.' As we have discussed in the past, the F-15IA will be based on the F-15EX used by the U.S. Air Force. Boeing and the U.S. Air Force have both heavily touted the aircraft’s range and stores-carrying capabilities as key features of the design. While this is seen as being particularly valuable for operations across the vast expanses of the Pacific with the U.S. Air Force, Israel has also long prized the Eagle for its ability to strike targets at long range with heavy loads of ordnance. A U.S. Air Force F-15EX Eagle II armed with 12 AIM-120 AMRAAMs. U.S. Air Force USAF/SSgt Blake Wiles As for the weapons Israel will likely procure to arm the F-15IA, the official press release when approval for the sale was granted mentioned only AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) launchers as well as the internal M61A Vulcan cannons. As it stands, the current F-15I Ra’am carries almost the entire range of Israeli Air Force air-launched weapons, defensive and offensive, and from U.S. and domestic production. The ability of the F-15IA to potentially carry outsize weapons, including hypersonic missiles, as well as simply larger numbers of legacy weapons, is also something that will very likely be of increasing interest to Israel. The recent operations against Iran have demonstrated Israel’s expanding use of air-launched ballistic missiles, which would also be a perfect fit to arm the F-15IA. An Israeli Air Force F-16I armed with the Rampage air-launched ballistic missile. U.S. Air Force For the Israeli Air Force, the 25 F-15IAs will provide an additional Eagle squadron, which will double the number of strike-optimized F-15s available to the service. Currently, the 25 F-15I Ra’am jets serve with 69 Squadron 'Hammers' at Hatzerim Air Base. The Israeli Air Force also operates squadrons flying the older F-15A-to-D Baz, which operate in air-to-air and air-to-ground capacities, but which are by now very long in the tooth, having first seen combat as long ago as 1979. Successively upgraded, and also bolstered through transfers from U.S. Air Force stocks, these jets are stationed at Tel Nof Air Base, and you can read more about them here. Israeli Air Force F-15A-to-D Baz fighters from 106 Squadron 'Tip of the Spear.' Amit Agronov Israel’s continued demand for F-15s of any kind has seen the surviving Baz jets progressively upgraded to keep them in frontline service. Potentially, the incoming F-15IAs might replace one of the two Baz squadrons, but that remains unclear at this point. There’s also the option to upgrade the F-15I Ra’am to a standard similar to the F-15IA — known as F-15I+ — although the Israeli Ministry of Defense didn’t mention the status of this in their announcement. An Israeli Air Force F-15I Ra’am. Israeli Air Force More generally, however, the F-15IA purchase is seen by Israel as an investment in long-term strategic capabilities, with these being under particular scrutiny right now as tensions with Iran continue to build, after several rounds of hostilities already this year. After all, the F-15 has — and will continue to be — Israel’s primary long-range strike weapon. 'The Ministry is executing a comprehensive strategy to enhance the IDF’s operational capabilities,' said the director general of the Israeli Ministry of Defense, Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir. 'We have secured procurement agreements worth nearly $40 billion since the onset of the war,' Zamir said, referring to the conflict that began in the Middle East after the surprise attack on Israel by Hamas militants on October 7, 2023. Also part of this longer-term strategy of enhanced military capabilities is the purchase of a third squadron of F-35I Adir stealth fighters, earlier this year. An agreement for that deal was signed in June this year. Covering 25 F-35Is worth approximately $3 billion. This will expand the Israeli Air Force Adir fleet to 75 aircraft. The latest batch will begin to be delivered in 2028. Israeli Air Force F-35I Adir stealth fighters. Israeli Air Force Israeli F-35I Adirs. Israeli Air Force Buying the F-15IA and F-35I will provide the Israeli Air Force with two complementary platforms, both of which are among the most capable anywhere in the world, especially when it comes to long-range strike. Israeli F-15s, in particular, are also used for forward networking and command and control nodes, vital for managing long-range operations. On the other hand, both the F-15IA and F-35I are also more than efficient for air defense, including against drone threats, as well as air-to-ground operations closer to Israel, such as the ongoing conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon.

Photo by JACK GUEZ/AFP via Getty Images Together, the Israeli Ministry of Defense described the joint F-15IA and F-35I acquisitions as 'a historic enhancement of our air power and strategic reach — capabilities that proved crucial during the current war.' That last statement would appear to be a direct reference to the Israeli Air Force’s retaliation strike on Iran last October 26, which came in response to Iran’s massive October 1 missile barrage on Israel. The Israeli strikes appear to have involved both F-15I and F-16I fighters, which largely launched exclusively standoff strikes from outside Iranian airspace. Of course, Israeli interest in buying more F-15s goes back many years, but the developing security situation in the Middle East seems to have prompted a decision to finally be made. The sale of 25 F-15IAs was obviously welcomed by Boeing. 'Boeing takes pride in its longstanding partnership with Israel, a relationship that dates back to our nation’s establishment,' said the President of Boeing Israel, Maj. Gen. (ret.) Ido Nehushtan. While Boeing is now building F-15EXs for the U.S. Air Force, that service is currently looking to buy 98 of the jets, so another batch of 25 F-15IAs is significant. It could also help secure further export orders. Indonesia has formally committed to buying up to 24 Advanced Eagles, but the deal is yet to be signed off by the U.S. government, while Poland has also been earmarked as a potential customer. An Indonesian delegation, led by Minister of Defense Prabowo Subianto (center) during a visit to Boeing’s St. Louis facility. Boeing There is also growing speculation that Israel could be poised to buy more AH-64 attack helicopters from Boeing. Much has been made of the efforts of a handful of Israeli Air Force AH-64s to intervene on October 7, 2023, and it seems increasingly attack helicopters, rather than drones, are being seen as critical to counter any such incursions in the future. The Apaches have meanwhile become an important tool to deal with hostile drone incursions into Israeli airspace, too. Long before October 7, the Israeli Air Force had been pushing to acquire another 40 of the latest AH-64E versions and earlier this year, it was reported that the sale of 12 AH-64Es was being discussed between the Israeli Ministry of Defense and officials from the Pentagon and U.S. State Department. When asked recently about a potential Israeli AH-64E order, a Boeing spokesperson told TWZ that they 'suspect that we will see additional requests coming in from Israel for these capabilities.' For the time being, the F-15IA is headed to Israel, with the announcement of a formal order. With the Israeli Air Force facing current and future challenges in the Middle East, it’s no surprise that the tried and tested Eagle has been selected to help the country maintain its tactical superiority in the region.

Skunk Works’ Latest Stealthy Tanker Concept Revealed	Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works advanced projects division has put forward a new notional vision for a stealthy pilot-optional aerial refueling tanker. This comes as the U.S. Air Force is refining requirements for a future Next Generation Air-refueling System (NGAS) 'system of systems' and amid serious concerns about how the service expects to pay for that and other modernization priorities. Skunk Works provided a rendering of its latest tanker concept refueling a pair of F-35A Joint Strike Fighters, seen at the top of this story and below, to The War Zone. A different view of this same conceptual design had been first shown publicly at the Airlift/Tanker Association’s (ATA) recently concluded annual symposium, as reported by Aviation Week. Lockheed Martin Skunk Works The rendering shows an aircraft with swept main wings and horizontal stabilizers with canted outboard vertical stabilizers. The tanker also has stealthy (low-observable) features, including a chine line that wraps around the forward fuselage and continues on either side behind the wing roots and saw-tooth panel lines at various points. Low observable shaping on its wingtip pods is also evident. Where the aircraft's engine intakes might be situated is not entirely clear, but there is a single large shrouded 'platypus-like' exhaust with serrated edges at the upper rear of the fuselage. The tanker is shown with a pair of refueling booms extending from pod-like sponsons toward the end of each main wing. The boom refueling method is the U.S. Air Force's preferred means of getting gas into other aircraft in flight. It is possible that the booms on Skunk Work's new design concept could also be configured to provide fuel via the probe-and-drogue method, which the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps prefer. Probe-and-drogue is also used to refuel Air Force CV-22 tiltrotors, as well as helicopters across the U.S. military. This system is often installed internally on the centerline rear of large tankers, such as the Air Force's KC-46 and now-retired KC-10, as well as the Airbus A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT). Whether or not the booms might be expected to collapse and/or retract when not in use is unclear. Though such a system could offer aerodynamic and radar signature-reducing benefits, it could also limit the strength of the boom. That, in turn, could present potential operational limitations and safety concerns. The booms on traditional tankers have been known to break under the wrong circumstances as happened just earlier this year in a mishap involving an Air Force KC-46 and an F-15E Strike Eagle combat jet, which you can read more about here. The KC-46, specifically, has been beset by various technical and other issues over the years, including a still unsolved 'stiff boom' problem that prevents it from being used operationally to refuel A-10 Warthog ground attack aircraft at all. A KC-46 refuels an A-10 Warthog ground attack aircraft during a test. USAF Aviation Week had reported that Skunk Work's notional design is pilot optional, there is no clear provision for a crewed cockpit seen in the renderings available. It is possible that a cockpit could be fitted, as required, in place of a faired-over section on top of the forward fuselage. Another variation of the rendering might also exist showing a cockpit. A pilot-optional design versus a completely uncrewed does offer certain benefits. The War Zone previously explored this in detail after the emergence of the stealthy Model 437 Vanguard technology demonstrator jet from Northrop Grumman subsidiary scaled composites earlier this year, writing: 'Unmanned aircraft are still quite restricted as to where and how they can operate. A pilot totally changes this massive bottleneck and means the aircraft can be flown wherever it needs to go, to participate in any developmental flights or training exercises, no matter how complex. It can do this unburdened by typical drone airspace restrictions and the need for chase aircraft that can be required in certain situations. Just ferrying to a different location while manned, so it can access airspace where it can fly as if it were an unmanned aircraft, is a giant advantage.' 'For many tests, having a human onboard can accelerate the speed at which they can be accomplished. At its most basic, initial primary flight testing of the airframe will go far faster with a pilot at the controls. Overall, more risks can be taken when executing autonomous activities with a pilot there to take over and act as a safety backstop if needed.' Skunk Works has publicly shown a number of other notional advanced crewed tankers in the past, including a boom-equipped one with an almost fighter-esque appearance just earlier this year, the features of which we previously explored in detail. Lockheed Martin has presented variations on a blended-wing-body design concept configured for boom and probe-and-drogue refueling, as well.

Joseph Trevithick Lockheed Martin art from the late 2010s depicting stealthy blended wing body tankers fueling aircraft using the boom and probe-and-drogue methods. Lockheed Martin 'Our team continues to explore a variety of configurations that deliver mission effectiveness through a connected, affordable, survivable and autonomous next generation tanker capability,' a Skunk Works spokesperson told The War Zone when asked for more details about the newest notional design. 'We look forward to providing the U.S. Air Force with the range and endurance needed to fulfill the future of NGAS as it continues to define requirements.' As already noted, the Air Force currently describes NGAS as a proposed family of systems, which could include a crew or uncrewed stealthy tanker, or a pilot-optional design, or some combination thereof. Boeing has also been pitching a land-based derivative of the MQ-25 Stingray tanker drone that it is developing for the U.S. Navy as a possible option for NGAS. The complete NGAS 'system of system' is also expected to include existing non-stealthy tankers like the KC-46 and the KC-135 with various self-defense and other upgrades. The Air Force has also been actively exploring ‘buddy store’ podded aerial refueling systems that can work with aircraft configured to use the boom, which would also allow other aircraft, including tactical jets, to contribute to this refueling ecosystem. Uncrewed tankers could be paired with crewed ones in a hub-and-spoke arrangement, with the drones helping ferry fuel to areas closer to the tactical edge while reducing risks to human aircrews. It is worth noting here that Skunk Work's new rendering shows a notional design that can be refueled in flight itself. Other tactics, techniques, and procedures could also help reduce the vulnerability of key aerial refueling assets, including linking up with receivers at lower altitudes below an enemy's radar horizon. This is something the Air Force's special operations community already has experienced doing, including with a pocket fleet of specialized KC-135RT 'receiver-tankers' that can refuel and be refueled in mid-air, which you can read more about here. A mid-air refueling capable KC-135RT about to link up with a regular KC-135 tanker. USAF The War Zone has been highlighting the increasingly critical need for stealthy or otherwise more survivable tankers for years now. Expanding and evolving air defense threats, especially in the context of potential high-fight with China have only underscored this reality and are key drivers behind the Air Force's current NGAS planning. 'Essentially the threat, China again, has reached out with new counter-air systems that could threaten our aircraft, especially tankers, at longer ranges, beyond the ranges which we normally would refuel fighter planes,' Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall said in a keynote address at the same ATA symposium where Skunk Works first rolled out its new tanker rendering. 'This put our whole tanker acquisition strategy in question. It is still in question, but we are working to resolve the uncertainty as quickly as possible.' Critical factors in this ongoing debate are range considerations, which are particularly pronounced in the Pacific region, together with the typically short combat radii of America's current tactical combat jet fleets. This, in turn, puts existing tankers dangerously close to, if not inside anti-access/area denial bubbles near-peer competitors like China have already established and continue to expand. Stealthy tankers that are not meant to penetrate deep into high-threat airspace, but to persist and operate on the edges of those zones, allowing existing tactical airpower and newer platforms to make it to their targets, could be part of changing that equation. Air Force plans for a new sixth-generation crewed stealth combat jet and Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones as part of the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative have been set to have significant impacts in all this, with discussions about their expected ranges (and other capabilities) also tied in with how NGAS evolves. Procurement of a stealth tanker could help trade range and thus the complexity and cost of these new tactical platforms, while also keeping existing ones more relevant. The NGAD combat jet program is currently undergoing a deep review and the outcome of that reassessment will also have direct ramifications for the NGAS and CCA efforts. In addition, 'unfortunately, any new [tanker] design cannot be fielded for several years at best, even if affordable,' Kendall warned while speaking at the ATA gathering, highlighting potential lower cost-near term alternatives, such as upgrading existing tankers.

Public Domain The Air Force's top civilian also added new and even more dire remarks to a growing chorus of concerns about the affordability of a host of next-generation modernization efforts beyond NGAS that the service has previously described as essential for fighting and winning future high-end conflicts. 'The variable that concerns me most as we go through this analysis and produce a range of alternatives is going to be [the availability of adequate resources.] … to pursue any combination of those new designs,' Kendall said, referring to the NGAD combat jet and CCA drones, as well as NGAS. You can read more about this brewing budgetary crisis here. The Air Force is hoping to have firmer understanding of its NGAS requirements before the year is out. At that point, it may be clearer whether or not something like Skunk Work's newest design concept is what the service is looking for to meet its future aerial refueling needs, if it can afford them.

Ukraine Hits Caspian Sea Port For The First Time	Ukraine for the first time struck a target in Russia’s Dagestan region on Wednesday, according to local and Ukrainian officials, eyewitnesses, and Russian and Ukrainian media. The military port at Kaspiysk on the Caspian Sea was attacked by Ukrainian drones about 670 miles from the front lines. It is home to the Russian Navy's Caspian Flotilla and coastal troops, including marine forces, according to the independent Russian Astra media outlet. 'The flotilla has conducted missile strikes on Ukraine, and the 177th Marine Regiment has participated in combat operations in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions,' the publication noted.

Ukrainian sources say at least one Russian vessel was damaged while Russians claim all the drones were shot down before any ships were hit, but resulting shrapnel injured a teenager. 'For the first time during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, a drone struck ships of the Caspian flotilla of the Russian Navy,' Alexander Kovalenko, the head of Countering Disinformation under Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, stated on Telegram. 'Later, the media reported that in Kaspiysk, as a result of the strike, the combat ships of Project 11661 class ships Tatarstan and Dagestan were damaged.' The head of the Dagestan regional government had a different take. 'This morning, air defense forces destroyed an unmanned aerial vehicle over the Caspian Sea,' Sergei Melikov said on Telegram. Video emerging from the scene indicates that neither point of view is fully accurate. One video shows a drone, which appears to be a Ukrainian-made Aeroprakt A-22 ultralight aircraft converted into a one-way attack drone, flying through the continuous crackle of air defenses, eventually exploding on impact among the vessels. Kovalenko claims the video shows the drone striking near 'the mooring zone of a small missile boat of Project 21631 and a missile boat of Project 12418, the only representative of which in the Caspian flotilla is Stupinets.' However, it is hard to determine from the quality of the video if any ships were directly hit or suffered any damage. 'As far as I can see in the video, the decommissioned Tarantula class Stupinets corvette was not hit by a Ukrainian drone,' a retired Russian Navy officer who uses @Capt_Navy Twitter handle told The War Zone. 'In any case, the ship has already been withdrawn from the flotilla, decommissioned in 2023.'

Regardless of the outcome, the attack is significant in several ways. As we have noted in the past, Iran has used the Caspian Sea and its ports to ship missiles and other weapons to Russia in large measure because that route has been considered safe from Ukrainian attacks. In addition, this marks a new targeting of the Russian Navy. In June, they began launching Kalibr long-range cruise missiles from the Sea of Azov instead of the Black Sea. That's because it became more dangerous for them launching from the western Black Sea after repeated attacks by Ukrainian missiles and aerial and sea dones. 'Kaspiysk is more than a thousand kilometers away from the probable launch site and the drone, which is an adapted light aircraft, covered this distance without any problems, and in daylight!' Kovalenko noted. 'Hundreds of kilometers through Russian echeloned air defense, not a small-sized, compact object, but a light aircraft!' 'Yes,' he added, 'this is the first strike on the Russians in the Caspian Sea during the entire period of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which clearly hints – sailors, you will not have peace in either the Black Sea or the Caspian!' Russia's military port of Kaspiysk on the Caspian Sea is nearly 700 miles from the front lines and less than 420 miles from Iran. (Google Earth image) The inability of Russian air defenses to spot drones before flying over the port was not lost on one influential Russian Telegram channel. 'There were reports that the enemy did not achieve its targets with its morning attack,' the Two Majors Telegram channel said. 'However, we cannot bring ourselves to call the air defense system at the naval base effective. The enemy crashed his drone into the port not because his drone was new, super-maneuverable or armored. No, it's just that bureaucracy and the speed of decision-making do not allow even proactive officers (especially in the Navy) to change anything on their own.' This is just the latest in Ukraine's long-range drone strikes on Russian targets. Given the importance of the Caspian Sea to Moscow's war effort, there will likely be more.

New Heavyweight Chinese Jet Drone Looks To Be A Swarm Mothership	A new very large jet-powered Chinese drone said to have a 10-ton maximum takeoff weight, or a mockup thereof, has emerged ahead of the formal opening of this year's Zhuhai Airshow. The design notably appears to be at least depicted as being fitted with a modular payload section designed to launch swarms of smaller uncrewed aerial systems. Reportedly dubbed Jiu Tian, or 'High Sky' in Chinese, the new jet drone design comes from the state-run Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC). The example at Zhuhai, which officially opens next week, is also marked 'SS-UAV' in Latin script. While 'UAV' (uncrewed aerial vehicle) seems obvious, it is unclear what the 'SS' might stand for. The Jiu Tian has a high main wing with minimal, if any sweep and small winglets at the tips, along with an h-shaped tail. The design is powered by a single jet engine on top of its central fuselage and has a tricycle landing gear arrangement. The combination of features gives the drone, in some very broad strokes, the outward visual appearance of something of a mashup of the A-10 Warthog and OV-10 Bronco attack aircraft. A sensor turret of the kind typically fitted with a mix of electro-optical and infrared cameras is mounted under the Jiu Tian's nose. The drone also has a nose radome pointing to provisions for a radar inside. As noted, there are reports that the Jiu Tian has a maximum takeoff weight of around 10 tons. For comparison, the CH-6 armed drone that emerged at Zhuhai in 2021, another relatively large jet-powered design, is said to have a maximum takeoff weight of 7.8 tons. A year later, AVIC's Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group (CAIG) subsidiary also rolled out a new Wing Loong 3 pusher-propeller-driven armed drone, the largest member of the Wing Loong family to date, with a stated maximum takeoff weight of six tons. As another reference point, the stated maximum takeoff weight of newer extended-range versions of the U.S. MQ-9 Reaper is just under six tons. The CH-6, or more likely a mockup thereof, on display at the 2021 Zhuhai Airshow. Chinese Internet The Jiu Tian also sports four stores pylons under each wing, though nothing is seen loaded onto them in the images that have emerged so far. By far, the most interesting feature is the central payload section, which is labeled 'Isomerism Hive Module' in English. Isomerism is a term typically used in chemistry that refers to the potential existence of isomers, which are molecules or ions with identical molecular formula, but that differ in the physical and chemical arrangements of their atoms. This appears to be something of a mistranslation of the Chinese phrase printed above on the drone, which says 'ascension of the beehive mission module,' according to a machine translation. That, in turn, points strongly to the module as least being meant to reflect one capable of launching smaller drones, potentially in networked swarms. China's interest in swarming capabilities and the ability to launch them from various platforms, including high-altitude balloons, is not new. For military purposes, swarms have a number of inherent benefits, including the ability to rapidly fan out across a broad area to carry out various missions depending on how they are configured, including intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), electronic warfare, and kinetic strike. Individual drones in a swarm can also equipped with different payloads to give the entire grouping a multi-mission capability. Large numbers of uncrewed aerial systems operating closely together also present significant challenges for defenders, who could easily find themselves overwhelmed or otherwise confused about how to best respond to the incoming threats. The War Zone previously laid out a case for giving exactly this kind of drone swarm launch capability to reconfigured P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol planes, which you can read more about here. Drones launching other drones offers a way to push these capabilities further forward while reducing the risk to crewed platforms. There are ever-growing efforts to develop and field swarming uncrewed aerial systems, and the ability to launch from them from various platforms in the air and down below, globally, including in the U.S. military, for the same array of reasons. These and other advancing drone capabilities, driven heavily by developments in artificial intelligence, only look set to expand in scale and scope, and to continue to proliferate, as time goes on, as you can read more about here. Beyond the ability to launch swarms, Jiu Tian's underwing pylons and sensors point to the drone being designed to have onboard ISR and strike capabilities, as well. Though shown with the drone mothership module, the design appears to have a highly modular central section that could be reconfigured to give the drone other capabilities, such as additional sensor packages, air sampling systems, or even the ability to deliver certain cargoes. More broadly speaking, Jiu Tian could give China's armed forces a valuable additional multi-mission long-range and long-endurance uncrewed platform. Jet propulsion, in general, offers benefits when it comes to reducing transit times to and from mission areas and endurance once on station. The different branches of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) already have a number of long-endurance jet and turboprop-powered drones with ISR and armed strike capabilities in their inventories. The uncrewed aircraft now operate regularly over and around various hotspots in the Pacific, including the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait, as well as overland, especially toward contested border areas with India.

Infinty 0 via Wikimedia The TB-001 Scorpion seen here is among the long-endurance turboprop drones already available to China's armed forces. VCG/VCG via Getty Images It's also worth noting here that a particularly substantial body of evidence already exists pointing to potential game-changing impacts from the employment of drone swarms on both sides in any future conflict over Taiwan. The U.S. military has been helping its Taiwanese counterparts in recent years to put a plan into place that would turn the airspace and waters around the island into a 'hellscape' full of uncrewed platforms in the event of an invasion. USAF Jiu Tian also underscores China's substantial and still-growing investments in new and expanded drone capabilities, including significant progress toward fielding higher-end stealthy flying-wing uncrewed combat air vehicles (UCAV) and new pilotless cargo aircraft. China's UCAV ambitions extend to maritime operations from aircraft carriers and big-deck amphibious warfare ships, as well. The U.S. military has increasingly been lagging behind, at best, in many of these areas. The abandonment of work, at least publicly, on UCAVs within America's armed forces has been particularly pronounced, especially as other countries well beyond China also push ahead in this realm. Though not a stealthy design, Jiu Tian presents another potentially important addition to China's uncrewed arsenal, including in the role of drone swarm mothership.

China’s J-15T Enhanced Carrier-Based Flanker Officially Unveiled	China has publicly unveiled another new combat aircraft, with the arrival of the Shenyang J-15T single-seat carrier-based fighter at Zhuhai Airport for the China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition, better known as Airshow China, which opens next week. Just days ago, TWZ reported on the surprise appearance of the modernized naval fighter during unprecedented dual-carrier operations in the South China Sea. The appearance of the J-15T also follows yesterday’s official public debut of the Shenyang J-35A, a land-based mediumweight stealth fighter for the People’s Liberation Army Air Force. You can read our story on that development here. The 15th edition of Airshow China will be held in Zhuhai from November 12 to 17.

The new version is primarily distinguished from the original J-15 in being equipped for catapult takeoff but assisted recovery (CATOBAR) operations, rather than short takeoff but assisted recovery (STOBAR) operations.

The previous two People’s Liberation Army Navy, or PLAN aircraft carriers, the Liaoning and Shandong, both employ ‘ski-jump’ takeoff ramps to launch fixed-wing aircraft.

Photo by An Ni/Xinhua via Getty Images Xinhua News Agency The J-15T — which now appears to be in operational service — will be able to operate from both CATOBAR and STOBAR carriers, although the biggest benefits will be achieved through catapult launch. This will allow the fighter to take off from the carrier with a heavier payload of fuel and weapons. The CATOBAR features of the J-15 are clearly seen in the example at Zhuhai. They include a strengthened nose landing gear with a longer and wider shock-absorbing oleo strut and an accompanying catapult launch bar. Modifications will also have been made to the airframe to better cope with the stresses of catapult launch.

Added to these are at least 15 two-seat J-15S and perhaps a handful of two-seat J-15Ds for electronic warfare (not including the prototypes) — we will return to these later. A video showing the original J-15 fighter in action aboard the aircraft carrier Liaoning: Most surprisingly, the photos and videos of the J-15T at Zhuhai reveal that it’s fitted with domestically produced WS-10 turbofans in place of the Russian-made AL-31F engines previously found on production J-15s. 爱了 pic.twitter.com/QEDIVi7Snc&mdash; Sweet Clay (@Clay_PLAPAP) November 6, 2024 China’s long struggle to locally develop reliable and powerful turbofan engines has been well documented and, in the past, this issue was regularly identified as the Achilles’ heel of the country’s military aerospace industry. Many key types had long relied on Russian-supplied engines, but this is now a thing of the past, with all the latest series-production J-10, J-11, J-16, and J-20 fighters using Chinese-made engines. Until now, the only exception has been the carrier-based J-15, with the Russian engines perhaps being retained as a ‘tried and tested’ solution to help mitigate the riskier aspects of carrier operations. There have also been suggestions that the Russian engine was more resilient to saltwater than the Chinese one. After at least two J-15s were fitted with WS-10s on an experimental basis, it now appears that the turbofan has been adopted by the production-standard J-15T, which is a major development in itself, reflecting growing confidence in homegrown engines. An earlier J-15 fitted with WS-10 engines: This could be another major surprise The PLAN Naval Aviation converted at least one J-15 to WS-10B engines replacing the standard Russian AL-31F, so after only a few prototypes tested it in the early phase, this is eventually a hint that the WS-10 is ready for the J-15 too. pic.twitter.com/sTwdVnQU2k&mdash; @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) November 23, 2022 Considering that the first J-15 prototype was powered by WS-10s, it seems likely that the plan was always to use these engines on production machines. In the meantime, that same prototype was apparently used to test out both EMALS and traditional steam catapults at China’s land-based carrier test facility at Huangdicun. Ultimately, EMALS was chosen for the Fujian. Other changes are found in the J-15T’s cockpit. These include a new wide-angle holographic head-up display (HUD) as well as bars for the pilot to grab onto during catapult launches — a familiar feature of aircraft in this category. A head-on view of the J-15T showing its head-up display. via X The radome of the J-15T is different from that of the J-15, not only being a lighter gray color but having a revised shape, with a canted connection to the nose, and the pitot boom removed. The radome is understood to house a new active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, probably the same as used on the J-11D — the ultimate Chinese version of the land-based J-11 Flanker.

The radar is compatible with the latest short-range PL-10 and medium-range PL-15 air-to-air missiles, as well as a range of precision air-to-surface weapons. Previously, the J-15 relied primarily on the older PL-8 and PL-12 air-to-air missiles.

But the fact that the J-15T can operate from all three PLAN carriers and is ready for service immediately makes it a very attractive proposition before the stealthy J-35 arrives. At the same time, it will build valuable experience within the personnel of the PLAN’s growing carrier air wing contingent. Then, once the J-35 is in service, the J-15T will also provide a very capable counterpart to the stealth jet. The J-15T should also address any lingering concerns about the capability and reliability of the original J-15. There have been high-profile reports of several J-15 losses, as well as questions about the safety of the baseline aircraft, which The War Zone addressed here. With that in mind, the J-15T might well have further changes to help address those reported shortcomings, which are rumored to relate primarily to an 'unstable flight control system.' It might be the case that a version of the fly-by-wire flight control system used in the J-11D is also installed in the J-15T. A dramatic overhead formation of J-15 fighters over the first two PLAN aircraft carriers. At least 14 J-15T fighters are visible, together with original J-15s. Chinese Internet via X In CATOBAR form, the J-15T promises to finally get the most out of the impressive fuel and weapons loads that the Flanker has always been capable of carrying, but which have been strictly limited when configured for STOBAR operations. This is something that has hampered Russian Navy carrier operations, as much as Chinese ones. As well as the J-15T, which is a multirole fighter broadly comparable with the U.S. Navy’s F/A-18E Super Hornet, China is also working on a line of two-seat carrier-compatible J-15s, to take on additional roles. While few details are available, like the J-15T, these are also expected to be compatible on both CATOBAR and STOBAR carriers. While the J-15T is somewhat analogous to the F/A-18E, the two-seat J-15D electronic warfare aircraft is expected to operate in a role similar to the U.S. Navy’s EA-18G Growler, although it’s also thought to have a secondary strike mission. Examples of the J-15D might also have appeared on the deck of the Shandong as it conducted dual-carrier ops in the South China Sea, although we can’t be certain of that. A prototype J-15D with its characteristic wingtip electronic warfare pods. Chinese Internet via X Finally, the PLAN also looks set to receive another two-seat J-15 broadly comparable to the F/A-18F Hornet. This is the J-15S, which remains somewhat mysterious, with suggestions that it has entered service initially as a trainer. Ultimately, however, it may be further of developed into a two-seat carrier-based multirole strike and electronic warfare platform, possibly designated J-17. This would provide the PLAN with a versatile platform that could take on a range of missions including long-range strike, air defense, and perhaps working as a command and control platform for carrier-based combat drones. The future PLAN carrier air wing, for the Fujian, could eventually closely replicate that of the U.S. Navy, with the J-15T and J-15S in place of the F/A-18E/F, the J-15D for the EA-18G, the J-35 as an F-35C equivalent, and the KJ-600 performing the same airborne early warning and control mission as the E-2D Hawkeye. With various carrier-based drones in the works, China could also end up with a crewed/uncrewed carrier air mix similar to that being envisaged for the U.S. Navy.

Photo by Wan Quan/VCG via Getty Images @wanquanfoto In the meantime, the J-15T looks set to bring much-needed new capabilities to the PLAN’s carrier air wing, which has so far been entirely reliant on the increasingly outdated J-15 for its combat missions. Furthermore, a blend of familiarity, availability, affordability, and multirole capabilities should ensure the J-15T has a long future ahead of it on China’s three carriers, and potentially other flattops beyond those.

Crisis Brewing Over Air Force’s Future Air Dominance Plans Which ...	The future outlook for the U.S. Air Force's top modernization efforts is even more uncertain after the service's civilian boss openly questioned the affordability of buying any combination of new stealth fighters, advanced aerial refueling tankers, and highly autonomous drones. A deep review of plans to acquire a new sixth-generation crewed stealth combat jet is already underway, the results of which are set to have much broader ramifications. Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall made deeply concerning pronouncements about the state of the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative, as well as the Next Generation Air Refueling System (NGAS) effort, at the Airlift/Tanker Association's (ATA) annual symposium last Friday. The Air Force's sixth-generation combat jet program, also referred to as the NGAD or Penetrating Counter-Air (PCA) 'platform,' and its Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drone program, sit under the larger NGAD umbrella. A rendering of a notional sixth-generation combat jet flying together with a trio of drones. Collins Aerospace 'You may also have heard that the Department of the Air Force is reconsidering the Next Generation Air Dominance platform, the NGAD platform, our sixth-generation fighter. This isn't entirely accurate, or at least it is incomplete,' Kendall said during a keynote address at the ATA gathering. 'We are actually looking hard at the combination of the Next Generation Air Dominance platform, the Increment Two uncrewed Collaborative Combat Aircraft, and the Next Generation Aerial Refueling System, all in an Agile Combat Employment context.' The Air Force is currently running the CCA effort in incremental development cycles. General Atomics and Anduril are currently developing designs as part of Increment 1. Requirements for Increment 2, which could be dramatically different, are still being finalized. The stated plan previously was to launch the Increment 2 CCA competition sometime in Fiscal Year 2025, which began on October 1. A model of General Atomics’ CCA design. Jamie Hunter A model of Anduril's Fury design, which it is now developing under Increment 1 of the CCA program. Jamie Hunter When it comes to NGAS, the Air Force has consistently described it as a 'system of systems,' a core component of which has long been expected to be a new stealthy crewed tanker. Agile Combat Employment (ACE) collectively refers to a set of concepts of operations the Air Force has been developing in recent years that focus heavily on being able to deploy and redeploy forces quickly and in irregular ways, including to far-flung operating locations. The central objective behind ACE is to make it difficult for opponents to predict the movement of friendly forces and target them, while also reducing reliance on large established bases that are expected to be top targets during any future high-end fight. 'These three potential new designs and platforms are all tied together, both operationally and from an affordability perspective. We are working through a sprint of about four months of effort to determine the best combination of capabilities to pursue at various investment levels,' Kendall continued in his keynote. 'The variable that concerns me most as we go through this analysis and produce a range of alternatives is going to be [the availability of adequate resources.] &#8230; to pursue any combination of those new designs.' 'Right now, given our commitments, our resources, and strategic priorities, it's hard for me to see how we can afford any combination of those new designs,' Kendall added bluntly. Cost is already well known to be the central driver behind the review of the NGAD combat jet, which the Air Force hopes will wrap up before the end of the year. Initial estimates had put the unique cost of the aircraft in the region of $300 million or more. Kendall has repeatedly expressed a desire to cut that by a whopping two thirds, closer to that of a current generation F-35 stealth fighter, possibly by refocusing the design around a much more limited set of roles and missions, especially acting as a forward controller for CCA drones. You can read more about what that could look like in this past War Zone feature. It's also worth remembering that Chief of Staff of the Air Force Gen. David Allvin, the service's top officer, showed an artificial intelligence-generated rendering of a notional light stealth fighter, seen below, ostensibly a thought exercise, during a presentation at the Global Air and Space Chiefs Conference earlier this year. At the more recent 2024 Military Reporters & Editors (MRE) Conference last month, Allvin said that the B-21 Raider stealth bomber taking on a greater 'air dominance' role depending on the outcome of the NGAD combat jet review had not been 'taken &#8230; off the table,' as well. YouTube capture The Air Force also previously disclosed the intersection of the NGAD combat jet, Increment 2 CCA, and NGAS plans, which was not surprising to begin with. The NGAD 'fighter' has long been presented as an important future 'quarterback' for CCAs, but there has also been some uncertainty around exactly how those drones will be utilized, in general. The Air Force recently pushed back on assertions from Lockheed Martin that the Increment 1 CCAs would likely be more experimental than operational in nature. Lockheed Martin was notably not chosen to proceed in the initial phase of the CCA program, having, by its own admission, proposed an advanced, but also extremely costly design. At the same time, in the past year or so, the Air Force has notably walked back its language about its plans for the CCA fleets, especially their size. When the program was first announced, the Air Force's stated goal was to buy as many as 1,000 of those drones, if not many more. It has since been clarified that this figure reflects the expected CCA fleet size across all increments. In April, Secretary Kendall said that he expected there to be just around '100 [aircraft] on order or delivered' under Increment 1 by the end of the decade, at which point the hope is that they will have entered operational service. Chief of Staff Allvin has also since put forward a 150 airframe figure for Increment 1. How many more drones from subsequent increments may also be on hand or on the way by 2030 is unknown. In addition, the final design of the NGAD combat jet, as well as that of future CCAs, will have clear and direct implications for what it will take refueling-wise to support their operations. When it comes to future tankers, The War Zone has already been highlighting for years the increasingly critical need for more survivable refueling platforms, especially to support stealthy aircraft operating in highly contested environments. A rendering of a notional stealth tanker refueling an F-35. Lockheed Martin Skunk Works 'Essentially the threat, China again, has reached out with new counter-air systems that could threaten our aircraft, especially tankers, at longer ranges, beyond the ranges which we normally would refuel fighter planes,' Kendall said at the ATA symposium. 'This put our whole tanker acquisition strategy in question. It is still in question, but we are working to resolve the uncertainty as quickly as possible.' Operational range considerations have long been shaping up to be especially central factors in air combat planning around a potential future large-scale conflict in the Pacific against China, including for CCA drones, some of which may or may not ultimately have aerial refueling capability. 'You have to understand the geography, the nature of the environment within which you would use' CCAs, Chief of Staff Allvin said at the MRE conference in October, highlighting the particular 'tyranny of distance' involved in any operations in the Pacific. Earlier this year, the Air Force's top officer detailed plans for a new large-force exercise next summer focused heavily on just testing the service's ability to get forces where they need to be in the region relatively rapidly. A map relating to the planned REFORPAC large-scale exercise set to take place in summer 2025. Note the deployment timelines measured in days, underscoring the challenges of rapidly pushing forces forward in the region. USAF via Hudson Institute 'We must have a more resilient tanking capability. There are a number of ways to accomplish this,' Kendall added in his keynote last week. 'A new design, purpose-built tanker – NGAS – is one of them. Unfortunately, any new design cannot be fielded for several years at best, even if affordable.' Any new stealthy tanker design might also be pilot-optional or even entirely uncrewed. Crewed and uncrewed tankers of various kinds could also deliver fuel to receivers via a hub-and-spoke concept, with more survivable aerial refuelers ferrying gas to areas closer to the tactical edge. The Air Force is also exploring new ‘buddy store’ podded aerial refueling systems compatible with aircraft that use the boom method, which is the service's preferred way for getting gas into aircraft in flight. This might allow for even existing fighter-sized aircraft to help support refueling operations. 'Other options include various ways of increasing the resilience of the current force,' Kendall continued. 'The need for improved connectivity and some degree of enhanced self-protection measure[s] appears to be attractive from both an affordability and cost-effectiveness perspective. It is also something that can be accomplished in relatively short time frames at relatively low cost.' The Air Force, as well as the U.S. Navy, has been eying new defensive and situational awareness upgrades for tankers and other larger support aircraft for years now. Fielding dedicated loyal wingman-like drones to help protect those platforms is also being actively explored. A variety of other modernization efforts for the non-stealthy KC-135 and KC-46 tankers in the Air Force's inventory are also on the table, including a potential pathway to turning them into optionally crewed aircraft. Those aircraft could also see their roles and missions expanding, including through the addition of the ability to act as motherships for swarms of drones. From right-to-left, US Air Force KC-135, KC-46, and KC-10 tankers. The service retired the last of its KC-10s in September. USAF All three of the US Air Force's current tankers. From front to back, a KC-135, a KC-46, and a KC-10. USAF There is also the matter of next-generation airlift capabilities, which Kendall stressed the importance of in his ATA keynote address. However, plans for a future Next Generation Airlift (NGAL) system of systems are even further away on the horizon than NGAS and face the same affordability challenges. The Air Force has been warning about the impacts of at best largely flat defense budgets in the coming years, too. The service has other priorities it needs to pay for, as well. Most prominent among those demands at present is the new LGM-35A Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile and its associated infrastructure work, the costs of which have skyrocketed. Air Force officials have repeatedly said that they remain committed to the NGAD initiative broadly, as well as to finding ways to dominate the air superiority space going forward no matter what the specific combination of future platforms might look like in the end. That being said, concerns have been steadily growing about the shrinking size of the service's tactical jet fleets now. Kendall himself has said that the Air Force's current budgetary situation has been more and more apparent for some time now, raising additional questions about why the service is only wrapping up the review of its modernization plans now. Overall, the prospect that one or more top-tier modernization programs, such as the NGAD combat jet, might end up seriously truncated or even canceled seems to be steadily growing. The current NGAD platform discussions, specifically, in many ways evoke the memory of what happened to plans for the F-22 Raptor in the late 2000s. At least one retired Air Force official has since said that the service sacrificed its dream of a larger Raptor fleet in order to save what evolved into the B-21. *tens (typo, argh!!)&mdash; Gareth Jennings (@GarethJennings3) November 5, 2024 Whatever happens to the NGAD combat jet program in the coming months, it is clear that the impacts will be much wider spread across the Air Force's modernization priorities. Serious questions have now emerged about what it will take for the service to be able to afford any next-generation aircraft fleets, including future tranches of CCA drones and stealth tankers.

Navy Posts Its First AIM-174 Missile-Armed F/A-18F Super Hornet ‘...	The U.S. Navy has now released its first official images of one of its F/A-18F Super Hornets with a very heavy air-to-air missile loadout that includes four of its new AIM-174Bs. We now know for sure that the jet from Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Nine (VX-9), the 'Vampires,' with its distinctive gloss-black retro-scheme, was taking part in a new iteration of the Gray Flag test and evaluation exercise. The War Zone posited this was likely the case when the first images of the AIM-174B-armed aircraft first emerged back in September. The pictures from Gray Flag 2024 also show the F/A-18F flying together with a Navy F-35C Joint Strike Fighter, also assigned to VX-9, as well as a U.S. Air Force F-15E Strike Eagle. Marine Corps and Army personnel, as well as representatives from unspecified allies and partners, also took part in the exercise. Naval Test Wing Pacific and VX-9 hosted the event from their main base at Point Mugu in California. A U.S. Navy F/A-18F and F-35, both assigned to Air Test and Evaluation Squadron (VX) 9, fly over the Point Mugu Sea Range in Southern California with a U.S. Air Force F-15 during Gray Flag 2024 on Sept. 24, 2024. (U.S. Navy photo by Lt. Cmdr. Kory Hughs) (U.S. Navy photo by Lt. Cmdr. Kory Hughs) (U.S. Navy photo by Lt. Cmdr. Kory Hughs) In addition to the AIM-174s, the VX-9 F/A-18F's Gray Flag loadout included a trio of medium-range AIM-120 AMRAAMs and a pair of short-range AIM-9X Sidewinders. The aircraft also had an infrared search and track system (IRST) in a modified drop tank on its centerline, as well as an ATFLIR targeting pod on its left cheek station. This very heavy air-to-air loadout would be an unlikely one, at least in most situations, for shipboard operations due to restrictions on the jet's weight when returning to the ship, but could possibly prove very useful for land-based missions. The first image of the F/A-18F Super Hornet with four AIM-174 missiles emerged in September. (point_mugu_skies) 'Gray Flag 2024 was an opportunity to bring together a diverse group of participants from different branches of the military, academic partners, science and technology leaders, and allied partners,' Navy Capt. David Halpern, head of Naval Test Wing Pacific, said in a statement. 'The broad scope of participants allowed us to test and evaluate our systems and how they interact with one another in an operationally relevant environment.' The inclusion of the AIM-174 in Gray Flag 2024 is notable, but not at all surprising. These exercises regularly feature new and improved munitions and other capabilities, including ones still in development or of an experimental nature. The AIM-174B first truly broke cover in July at the biennial Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise, at which point the Navy also disclosed that it was in at least limited operational service. The War Zone had already been closely tracking signs pointing to the existence of the weapon, an air-launched version of the highly capable surface-launched multi-purpose SM-6 missile. The War Zone has previously explored in detail how the AIM-174B is set to be central in the Navy's future air combat planning, especially around potential high-end conflict with China in the Pacific. The missile offers important new ways to leverage emerging kill webs and challenge ever-evolving enemy ones, as you can read more about here and check out our video feature on it below. With this in mind, it is interesting to note that Gray Flag 2024 'was the most expansive interoperability event to date, with the data captured informing requirements, tactics, techniques, and procedures for future kill chains,' according to Naval Test Wing Pacific's Capt. Halpern. The AIM-174 looks set to continue being an extremely important feature in future exercises and operational deployments.

China’s J-35A Stealth Fighter Officially Breaks Cover	China has publicly unveiled the Shenyang J-35A, a land-based stealth fighter that has been under development for some time but which had previously only been seen in unofficial and frequently poor-quality imagery. While we now have a good look at the aircraft, many questions remain, especially about the People’s Liberation Army Air Force’s (PLAAF) plans for it, since the base design was previously understood to be under development primarily for export and latterly also for carrier-based service with the PLA Navy. The first official photo of the J-35A was released today, ahead of its planned debut at the China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition, better known as Airshow China, held at Zhuhai Airport in Guangdong province, in southern China. The show opens on November 12. The front three-quarter view of the jet, seen taxiing, reveals several new details and sheds more light on features that were previously more hidden. It also provides a very useful comparison with earlier versions of the J-35 and FC-31, as well as with rival fifth-generation fighters. Also will have export variant J35E/J31 as I have said countless times Here compared with FC31 demonstrator pic.twitter.com/kPAnJBRcZk&mdash; Húrin (@Hurin92) November 5, 2024 Much has been made of the similarities between the J-35/FC-31 and the U.S.-made F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, fueling claims that China copied its American counterpart or at least that it made use of stolen data to directly inform the aircraft's development. While there is no doubt that China has obtained classified data on a range of sensitive Western military programs, and the F-35 program in particular, it doesn't mean the jet was 'copied.' In fact, China cannot copy the F-35, it is one of the world's most complex machines. It can emulate its overall design and knock-off components and certain technologies that it can reproduce and has the data to do so, but the idea that it is a direct copy is blatantly false and a common trope when it comes to comparing foreign military hardware with U.S. designs. Critical outright differences exist, including its twin-engine powerplant compared to the F-35's large single turbofan engine. While the F-35 was designed from the start to accommodate a short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) version, this requirement is absent from the Chinese design. There are clearly many elements that were at least heavily inspired if not cribbed from the F-35, including its DSI inlets, canopy, and basic configuration. Even the name isn't trying to hide that reality. But overall, despite key similarities, the Chinese design is sleeker and more slender looking than the F-35. This is largely in part thanks to not having a STOVL requirement, but it also raises questions about its internal fuel capacity and its range, as well as the available volume for internal stores. Above all else, just because a fighter looks similar doesn't mean it performs anywhere near the same. This is especially true when it comes to what lays on and under the aircraft's skin — specially in terms of avionics and data fusion, sensor technology, and low observable (stealth) structures and coatings. The engines technology is also a major factor. Maybe the best comparison to the J-35A pic.twitter.com/RVS2okIunk&mdash; @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) November 5, 2024 Evolution pic.twitter.com/IfHqip7t0Q&mdash; Húrin (@Hurin92) November 5, 2024 Notable details that we can see in the new photo include an electro-optical targeting system, apparently equivalent to the EOTS found on the F-35, and similarly mounted under the nose, as well as a wide-angle head-up display in the cockpit. There is also what appears to be a radar-reflective Luneburg lens below the fuselage, designed to remove the stealthy jet’s radar-evading qualities when desired. The PLA has also now confirmed the J-35A designation for the land-based version of the fighter, with the carrier-based version being the J-35, and the initial prototypes having the export-centric FC-31 name. Based on that last designation, a land-based version of the jet for the PLAAF had been tentatively — and apparently unofficially — referred to as the J-31. Ever since the first two FC-31 prototypes appeared in land-based form, there had been speculation that as well as for export, a version might also be in the works for the PLAAF, likely as a lighter and more cost-effective complement to the Chengdu J-20. The first FC-31 prototype taxis after a flight at Airshow China 2014 in Zhuhai, on November 11, 2014. JOHANNES EISELE/AFP via Getty Images The first of the FC-31 prototypes took to the air in October 2012. Like the J-35A, the FC-31 also made its public debut at Airshow China, appearing at Zhuhai in 2014. Then followed, in 2016, a thoroughly reworked and greatly refined version of the FC-31, which we discussed in detail at the time. Two photos of the refined second FC-31 prototype. Chinese Internet Work on the land-based FC-31/J-31 was then seemingly scaled back, suggesting a lack of official interest and, before long, the design was significantly reworked for carrier operations, as the J-35. A mockup of the FC-31 stealth fighter is showcased at Airshow China 2022 on November 6, 2022, in Zhuhai, China. Photo by VCG/VCG via Getty Images It was only toward the end of last year that a land-based version of the fighter for domestic use came back into the frame, while progressively clearer photos of one of the prototypes appeared to reveal key features different from those found on the carrier-based J-35. It seems this prototype flew on or around September 26, 2023. Compared to the naval version, the prototype seen in unofficial imagery toward the end of last year appeared to have a smaller overall wing surface area, a characteristic that is also found on the land-based F-35A, in contrast with the bigger wing of the carrier-based F-35C. A comparison of the wing platforms of the first two prototype land-based FC-31 prototypes, a naval J-35 prototype, and what appears to be the land-based J-35A. via Andreas Rupprecht That prototype also appeared to have different landing gear, with a single nose wheel, not the twin wheels found on the naval jet. This feature can now be seen in much better detail in the photo of the J-35A released today. At the same time, the catapult launch bar is also deleted. While there had been a previous announcement of official Pakistani plans to acquire a land-based version of the jet, today’s publication of a photo of the J-35A also brought confirmation that the PLAAF is interested in getting its own examples, a significant development in itself. Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Sidhu, the Pakistan Air Force chief, at the podium, during a ceremony in January 2024 at which plans to procure the FC-31 were announced. PAF Facebook page What we don’t yet know is how far advanced the PLAAF’s plans for the J-35A might be, but the aircraft as publicly revealed wears Air Force insignia on the nose, a service-style overall gray color scheme, and is emblazoned with markings on the tailfins that commemorate the service’s 75th anniversary. Compared to the naval J-35, the tailfins are also of a different design on the J-35A, as well as being larger. Just translated: The J-35 officially announced that the hanging tail 75 is painted to celebrate the birthday of the Air Force! @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) November 4, 2024 A first interesting difference between the new J-35A and the J-35 naval version is the different rudder size & configuration on the Air Force version. pic.twitter.com/LBPegP7LPX&mdash; @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) November 4, 2024 Otherwise, it’s not clear whether the J-35A is a new prototype, one that has been seen before, or perhaps an earlier test aircraft that has been reworked according to PLAAF specifications. Of course, it may also be the same aircraft sighted in the latter half of last year. As for the PLA Navy’s J-35, this is very clearly intended to equip its fast-growing aircraft carrier fleet. While optimized for the latest carrier Fujian with its electromagnetic catapult launch system, there are growing signs that the J-35 will also go to sea in some capacity aboard the earlier carriers Liaoning and Shenyang, which have ‘ski-jump’ takeoff ramps. J-35 (right) and J-15 (left) carrier fighter mockups on the aircraft carrier Liaoning. Chinese Internet Chinese internet via X Turning to the PLAAF, this has so far focused on introducing the J-20, but, as we have explored in the past, complementing this ‘heavy’ stealth fighter with the smaller J-35A could make a good deal of sense. J20 vs J35 pic.twitter.com/Gvy7uhCmYy&mdash; 彩云香江 (@louischeung_hk) November 5, 2024 The service’s recent modernization has been spearheaded by the J-20 alongside the Flanker-derived Shenyang J-16 multirole fighter, as well as the lighter, homegrown Chengdu J-10. With the J-10 very likely approaching the end of its development potential and with the first of these aircraft already getting long in the tooth, the J-35A could be a very suitable replacement for the medium-weight segment of the PLAAF’s fighter force. A PLAAF J-10C fighter. PLAAF Chinese Military The J-35A is also going to be cheaper than the J-20 to procure and operate, meaning it can be fielded in greater numbers to enhance ‘combat mass’ in a way that would simply not be affordable with the bigger Chengdu stealth fighter. There is also an industrial incentive to procure the J-35A for the PLAAF, since it will keep Shenyang engaged in building fighters and will also likely help attract export orders. After all, the South Korean KF-21 Boramae and Turkish TF Kaan programs indicate that there is a market for a medium-weight fighter with low-observable characteristics. The Chinese design also has the major advantage of being immune to the tight export restrictions that typically apply to Western designs in the same class, with Beijing likely to grant export licenses to countries that might be prohibited from buying a South Korean or even a Turkish design, especially since both use U.S.-licensed engines. This export potential has long been the central focus of the meandering FC-31/J-35 program and it could greatly help break China farther out into higher-end fighter marketplace — especially if it is offered at an attractive price. If Pakistan does indeed order the jet it would also offset further development costs and lower production costs. If the PLAAF joins it in large numbers, the price could fall even farther. For now, there are many more questions about the J-35A and some of these might still be answered at Airshow China once it opens next week. In the meantime, the official unveiling of the J-35A, and confirmation of PLAAF interest, a little over a year since it was first spotted, once again demonstrates the pace of development in China’s military aerospace industries.

Suspected Russian Airplane Sabotage Plot Sparks Call For NATO Act...	An advisor to Lithuania’s president is demanding NATO action after claims emerged that the country was the nexus of a Russian sabotage plot to attack U.S. and Canada-bound aircraft by shipping camouflaged incendiary devices on them. This marks the latest in a series of allegations regarding Russian sabotage plots in Europe. 'The Presidency confirms that Russian military intelligence is behind the transport of incendiary packages,' Lithuanian presidential adviser Kęstutis Budrys told the Lithuanian Ziniu radio station on Tuesday. 'We are telling our allies that it's not random, it's part of military operations. This requires a NATO response.' Budrys was referring to a recently divulged Russian plot that originated in Lithuania over the summer, according to Reuters. The scheme, in which German officials say a plane crash was narrowly avoided, is believed to be part of an effort to bring the war home to Ukraine's Western allies. (Reuters) - Russia is behind explosive parcels sent from Lithuania to European countries, a Lithuanian presidential adviser said on Tuesday, amid alarm amongst NATO countries that sabotage organised by Moscow nearly caused an air disaster.Western governments and intelligence…&mdash; Phil Stewart (@phildstewart) November 5, 2024 'Explosive parcels…caused fires in courier depots in Britain, Germany and Poland in July,' the Polish Gazeta Wyborcza daily newspaper reported last month, Reuters noted on Tuesday. Officials say disaster was narrowly avoided when one of the packages ignited in a courier depot in Germany before it could be placed on a plane. Western security officials say 'they believe that two incendiary devices, shipped via DHL, were part of a covert Russian operation that ultimately aimed to start fires aboard cargo or passenger aircraft flying to the U.S. and Canada, as Moscows steps up a sabotage campaign against Washington and its allies,' according to The Wall Street Journal, which broke the story Monday. European security officials 'have linked suspected Russian operatives to a plot to smuggle incendiary devices onto a cargo plane in Germany, in what investigators believe may have been a trial run for future attacks targeting North America-bound aircraft,' The Washington Post reported on Tuesday. An international probe 'that began after one of the devices caught fire prematurely in July determined that the plotters also sent packages without the flammable contents to U.S. and Canadian addresses, in an apparent test to see if the parcels could be successfully delivered,' the publication reported, citing European security officials. Polish authorities say 'four people were charged in connection with camouflaged explosives that ‘detonated during land and air transport’ in the U.K. in July, according to ABC News, citing a statement from the country's prosecutor's office. 'The group's activities consisted of sabotage and diversion related to sending parcels containing camouflaged explosives and dangerous materials via courier companies to European Union countries and Great Britain, which spontaneously ignited or detonated during land and air transport,' the Polish prosecutor's office said in a statement. 'The group's goal was also to test the transfer channel for such parcels, which were ultimately to be sent to the United States of America and Canada.' Western officials 'believe the fires originated in electric massage machines containing a ‘magnesium-based' substance,’' the BBC reported. Russia suspected of targeting logistics infrastructure including airplanes bound for the U.S.,Canada, Britain, EU. with incendiary devices hidden in massagers.Here’s CCTV footage of the device and how it started a fire within seconds in Birmingham pic.twitter.com/NqYn8t9sY6&mdash; Bojan Pancevski (@bopanc) November 5, 2024 As the Post proffered, this scheme is being seen 'as a provocative and particularly dangerous escalation in an alleged sabotage campaign directed by Moscow against NATO countries helping Ukraine defend itself against a Russian military invasion.' Who ordered it remains unclear. Three European security officials told the newspaper that it is unknown whether this was directed by the top of the Kremlin or by lower-level intelligence officials. Overall, there many questions that still need to be answered about this bizarre plot and its perpetrators. Top among them is why would Russia take such a risk? What is the ultimate objective? How does potentially killing large numbers of people in the air or on the ground advance Moscow's ambitions while still avoiding a direct conflict? Above all else, what is the evidence that this actually came from the Russian government? Having parcels exploding on civilian aircraft carrying cargo could have major repercussions during a time of war, where those logistical capabilities would be critical and disruptions would have major battlefield impacts, but such timing doesn't seem to fit with the operations observed. Whatever the case may be, government and civilian officials are paying attention. 'We are aware of two recent incidents involving shipments in our network,' a DHL official said in a statement. 'We are fully cooperating with the relevant authorities to protect our people, our network and our customers’ shipments.' 'The U.S. continues to be vigilant against threats to the aviation and air cargo systems,' a U.S. official told The War Zone, citing the 2025 Homeland Threat Assessment. 'We work closely with industry to take steps to protect against any potential threats whenever they emerge. At this time, there is no current active threat targeting U.S.-bound flights.' 'We continually adjust our security posture as appropriate and promptly share any and all relevant information with our industry partners, to include requirements and recommendations that help them reduce risk,' a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) official said in a statement. 'Over the past several months, as part of a multi-layered security approach, TSA worked with industry partners to put additional security measures for U.S. aircraft operators and foreign air carriers regarding certain cargo shipments bound for the United States, in line with the 2021 TSA Air Cargo Security Roadmap. We greatly appreciate the cooperation and collaboration with industry as together we work to ensure the safety and security of air cargo.' TSA Canadian officials say they are aware of the plot and are concerned about its implications. 'The Government of Canada is aware of and deeply concerned with Russia’s intensifying campaign, from cyber incidents and disinformation operations to sabotage activities,' Zarah Malik, a spokesperson for Public Safety Canada said in a statement to The War Zone. 'Canada has expressed this concern directly to Russian officials and unequivocally stated that any threat to the safety and security of Canadians is unacceptable.' 'While there is no imminent threat to Canadians at this time, Canadian national security and law enforcement agencies are working in close cooperation with our allies on this serious matter to keep Canadians safe,' Malid added. 'The Government of Canada will continue to monitor the situation very closely and will take whatever action is necessary to protect Canadians.' Russia denies being behind acts of sabotage, according to the BBC. 'But it is suspected to have been behind other attacks on warehouses and railway networks in EU member states this year, including in Sweden and in the Czech Republic,' the network noted. There have been other suspicious incidents of sabotage in Europe. As we reported in August, Norway revealed that one of its most strategic air bases was the target of sabotage. That announcement came as other European NATO air bases — namely in Germany — reported incidents - one of which remains unexplained. A critical communications cable associated with Evenes Air Station in northern Norway, home of F-35A fighters, was reportedly cut in an act of sabotage. (Norwegian Air Force) There were also reports about troubling drone activity over critical infrastructure. These incidents came amid increasing warnings about nefarious Russian activity on the continent, part of an apparent wave of ‘hybrid warfare’ as the conflict in Ukraine further stokes East-West tensions. While there is no evidence at the moment that Russia is behind the incidents in Norway and Germany, this all came as NATO has increasingly warned of the risk of an expanding campaign of sabotage, including cyberattacks, across Europe, in a new wave of hybrid warfare masterminded by Russia. In the last few months, there has been a spike in reported incidents of this kind, suspected to be connected to Russia, if not orchestrated directly by Moscow. As well as Germany and Norway, these incidents have been reported in other NATO countries including the Czech Republic, Poland, and the United Kingdom. In July, intelligence officials expressed concern about possible sabotage attacks by Russian-backed actors so acute it saw U.S. military bases across Europe placed on a heightened state of alert, 'for the first time in a decade,' according to CNN. Beyond the question of what Russia's goals would have been for such a flagrantly escalatory operation is if NATO will respond to this provocation and how. This clearly depends on what evidence actually exists that the Russian government was involved and to what degree. Considering its own sensitivities to escalation, it is possible that the alliance could take a wait-and-see approach. Though this plot seems to have been disrupted before anyone was hurt, such actions in the future could prove devastating and they could be used to cripple logistics at a time when they are needed most.

Full Retirement Of Ticonderoga Cruisers On Hold, Trio To Remain I...	The U.S. Navy has partially reversed course on its controversial plans to decommission the last of its Ticonderoga class cruisers by 2027, with three of the ships now set to continue serving further out toward the end of the decade. The new decision regarding the Ticonderogas is part of an ambitious Navy-wide strategy that includes a call to substantially increase the readiness of warships and other key assets within the next three years. This also follows the announcement last week that 12 of the oldest Arleigh Burke class destroyers will see their service lives extended. The Navy announced the life-extension plans for the USS Gettysburg, USS Chosin, and USS Cape St. George, yesterday. There are six more Ticonderoga class cruisers in service now that are still slated for decommissioning in the next two years. The Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Gettysburg. USN The new 'decision adds 10 years of cumulative ship service life from fiscal year 2026 to 2029,' according to a Navy release. 'All three cruisers received extensive hull, mechanical and engineering, as well as combat system upgrades as part of an extended modernization program.' It is worth noting that USS Cape St. George, which is also the youngest still-serving Ticonderoga (commissioned in 1993), is actually still going through this upgrade process and is expected to return to the fleet sometime in the current fiscal year, which started on October 1. The modernization program includes improvements to the ship's Aegis Combat System, a new AN/SPQ-9B radar and upgrades to the existing AN/SPY-1B, an updated SQQ-89A(V)15 sonar suite, modifications to the Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) arrays to expand their capabilities, and a host of other work, according to Navy budget documents. The USS Cape St. George, another one of the three Ticonderogas that are seeing their service lives extended. USN The Navy's original plan was to put 11 of its Ticonderogas through this upgrade program, with the modernized ships then serving into the 2030s. However, growing costs and delays, coupled with worsening cracking and other structural issues, had led it to reassess those plans. In 2022, the service announced its intention to decommission all of the remaining cruisers – including ones right in the middle of being upgraded like Gettysburg and Chosin – by 2027. Two other modernized Ticonderogas, the USS Vicksburg and USS Cowpens, were decommissioned earlier this year. The entire modernization program has already cost the Navy billions of dollars. As already noted, the Navy's original decision to send the Ticonderogas into mothballs was highly controversial. Beyond the sunk cost of the upgrade work, there continue to be serious questions about capability and capacity gaps, which the service has downplayed for years. Each Ticonderoga has 122 Mk 41 VLS cells. For comparison, Flight I and II Arleigh Burke destroyers have 90 Mk 41 cells, while more recent Flight IIA and III ships in that class have 96. The planned decommissioning of the Navy's four highly in-demand Ohio class guided missile submarines, which can loaded with up to 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles apiece, before the end of the decade has only compounded concerns about dwindling missile launch capacity service-wide. It's interesting to point out here that USS Chosin was chosen to be the ship at the center of a test last month of the Transferrable Reload At-sea Method (TRAM) system for restocking Mk 41 VLS cells on ships at sea, which you can read more about here. Whether or not TRAM enters widespread service, at-sea reloading capabilities have emerged as a critical need for the Navy, especially in the context of planning for a potential future high-end fight, such as one in the Pacific against China. An empty missile canister is transferred to USS Chosin as part of a test of the Transferrable Reload At-sea Method (TRAM) system in October 2024. USN Eric Osborne The Ticonderogas were also designed from the outset as air and defense command and control platforms. The ships feature substantial capabilities in that regard that notably leads them to continue to be central components of Navy carrier strike groups. The service's stated plan is for new Flight III Arleigh Burkes, of which it currently has one, to take over this role. Questions have been raised in the past about the long-term viability of this 'maxed out' subclass of Burkes serving in this capacity. The Navy is working toward a true successor to the Arleigh Burke, currently referred to as DDG(X), but the first of those new warships is not expected to enter service until 2032 at the earliest. Previous plans for a direct replacement for the Ticonderogas evolved into the Zumwalt class of stealth destroyers, of which the Navy ultimately acquired just three. There continues to be ambiguity around the expected roles and missions of the Zumwalt class ships, as well as their overall future. A graphic from 2022 depicting a notional DDG(X) design and its features. USN 'As a former cruiser Sailor, I know the incredible value these highly-capable warships bring to the fleet and I am proud of their many decades of service,' Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro said in a statement about the life-extension plans for the Ticonderogas. 'After learning hard lessons from the cruiser modernization program, we are only extending ships that have completed modernization and have the material readiness needed to continue advancing our Navy's mission.' The Navy is facing larger hurdles when it comes to increasing its overall fleet size, as well as maintaining the warships and submarines it has now. Its new Constellation class frigates are also mired in delays, cost growth, and other issues, as you can read more about here. With all this in mind, just last week, the service also announced it would be extending the service lives of a dozen more Flight I Arleigh Burkes into the 2030s to help maintain overall operational capacity. Earlier this year, Adm. Lisa Franchetti, Chief of Naval Operations, unveiled a new service-wide 'navigation plan,' also known as Project 33, which included a prominent goal to be able to surge deploy 80 percent of all naval vessels and combat aircraft, if required, by 2027. 'We are shooting for very high, very tough stretch goals here, and I know that, but the only way we’re going to get there [is] if you set those goals that high,' Franchetti said in September. The new change in plans for the Ticonderoga class is significant. At the same time, the fact that just three of these still highly capable cruisers are getting a relatively short reprieve, and at a high cost, underscores the significant challenges the Navy still faces in meeting its very ambitious readiness and operational capacity goals.

We Finally Get A Clear Look At The Su-57 Felon’s Side Weapons Bay...	The arrival of two Su-57 Felon prototypes for the upcoming Airshow China has provided a good look at many details on Russia's most advanced fighter, although the most interesting has been a first close-up view of its small wing-root weapons bays. At TWZ we have previously examined this feature as well as the air-to-air missiles that are understood to be accommodated in the bays. While long known about, the weapons bays' details had remained something of a mystery and it remains unclear exactly how they function. The photo of the Su-57 showing the starboard-side wing-root weapons bay can be seen in the tweet embedded below, together with a close-up of the same image: First ever clear photo of Su-57's mysterious side weapon bayphoto by 万全@wanquanphoto pic.twitter.com/L1nNy8U2Rm&mdash; Fighterman_FFRC (@Fighterman_FFRC) November 5, 2024 The first Su-57 for Airshow China arrived at Zhuhai Jinwan Airport in South Central China’s Guangdong province on November 3, flying from Russia with a fuel stop at Taiyuan Wusu International Airport in northern China. This aircraft is the fourth prototype, or T-50-4, coded ‘054 Blue.’ The second Felon for the exhibition — the seventh prototype, T-50-7, ‘057 Blue’ — arrived at Zhuhai in a disassembled state aboard an An-124 cargo aircraft and it will be used as a static exhibit only. The Felon is making its debut at Zhuhai, its first foreign airshow appearance.

It should be recalled that this is an early prototype aircraft, with a lower standard of finish than production examples and, moreover, that the Su-57 is not designed to have anywhere near the same degree of stealth as Western fifth-generation fighters. Indeed, its overall design philosophy — which is highly influenced by Russia's low observable design and material science limitations — is very different, as we have discussed at length in the past. A pre-production Su-57. The triangular, canoe-like wing-root weapons bays are visible outboard of the aircraft’s engine intakes. Vitaly Kuzmin Returning to the wing-root weapons bays, one of these was seen during the reassembly of the T-50-7 at Zhuhai. The bays take the form of triangular-section fairings that are intended for quick launch — the clamshell-like doors popping open for a missile to be released and rapidly closing, to help maintain the jet's radar signature. These bays are in addition to the two large internal weapon bays that are arranged in tandem between the engines and which can carry much larger stores. Back in 2020, the Russian Ministry of Defense published a video showing a short-range missile launch from a pre-production Su-57’s wing-root bay, but no details of the bay itself could be seen. A sequence showing the launch of an air-to-air missile from one of the Su-57’s two small wing-root weapons bays. Russian Ministry of Defense Capture The missile launch clip begins at approximately 1:19 in the runtime of the video below: Even with the photo from Zhuhai, it’s still not possible to determine exactly how missiles are launched from these bays, although a trapeze mechanism, broadly similar to the one the U.S. Air Force’s F-22 Raptors use to launch AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles from their cheek bays, likely extend the missile outward at an angle into the Su-57’s slipstream. The missile launch video also appears to support this hypothesis. While the LOAL mode wouldn’t be required if the missile can be extended on a trapeze before launch, it would still be a very useful feature to call upon. An F-22’s side weapons bay with its launch rail carrying an AIM-9X extended. U.S. Air Force There is no evidence that the Su-57 wing-root bay doors can close or partially close with the missile extended, similar to the novel design found on China’s J-20. A J-20 with a pair of PL-10 air-to-air missiles deployed on the outside of the jet’s side weapons bays and with the main under-fuselage weapons bay also open. via Chinese Internet In the Su-57, each of the wing-root bays is understood to carry a single infrared-guided air-to-air missile, namely the K-74M2 (also known as the izdeliye 760) for close-air combat, produced by the Vympel missile design bureau. The K suffix denotes a missile that is still in the development phase, with the production version of the izdeliye 760 being the R-74M2. For now, its exact service status is unclear. In early 2021, the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) think tank suggested that the K-74M2 was 'in the final stages of testing.' As we have discussed before, the K-74M2 is optimized for internal carriage by the Su-57, with reduced dimensions and it also adds a new infrared seeker from the Russian Azov AOMZ company. Other changes over the earlier R-73 and R-74 missiles include a rocket motor with increased burn time, for longer range and a higher end game energy state. Published specifications for the K-74M2 include a maximum range of 31 miles, compared to 25 miles for the R-74, and 18.6 miles for the R-73. Missile range figures are often dubious at best and the K-74M2’s true real-world range will differ based on the flight profile of each engagement and the target's behavior, which can vary considerably. For example, if a lot of maneuvering energy is needed to reach the target, that impressive range figure could be reduced to a handful of miles. Importantly, the K-74M2 can reportedly also be fired in lock-on-after-launch (LOAL) mode, which means the seeker head can remain concealed within the bay during the target acquisition phase. Using LOAL, the missile begins its flight under inertial control, with a datalink allowing the launch aircraft to provide target updates during missile flight, before achieving an in-flight lock-on. It’s also worth noting that, in 2019, images emerged of what appeared to be a new, compact Russian air-to-air missile, derived, at least in part, from Vympel’s medium-range R-77 series. Its overall size and other design elements suggested it could potentially also be intended to fit inside the Su-57’s wing-root bays, although it was not the K-74M2, which was ultimately revealed to be much closer in form to the R-73 and R-74 from which it was derived. A display of missiles at the Vympel design facility. From top to bottom, the missiles are, an unconfirmed new design, an R-74/R-74, and an R-77, as well as a gray launch rail. Anton Novodereshkin/TASS Since then, it was reported that Russia was pressing ahead with an all-new ‘clean-sheet’ short-range missile to supersede the R-73 and R-74 series, the original design of which dates back to the Cold War. This new missile is the izdeliye 300M, also from Vympel, which is likely to be a continuation of an earlier advanced short-range air-to-air missile program, the izdeliye 300, which was canceled in the 1990s in favor of further development of the tried and tested R-73. It’s not clear whether the izdeliye 300M will also be scaled to fit the Su-57’s wing-root weapons bays, but that would seem possible, provided that its development continues. As well as the K-74M2, there are other air-to-air weapons tailored for internal carriage in the Su-57, albeit in its larger under-fuselage weapons bays, including the beyond-visual range R-77M (izdeliye 180) and the very-long-range-range (estimated at 186 miles) izdeliye 810 missiles. These are also based on existing designs, the R-77 (AA-12 Adder) and the R-37M (AA-13 Axehead), respectively. New versions of the R-77 spotted on a four Ship #Su57 ‘Felon’ formation on Russian TV for the first time. The second aircraft carries the newer version of the K-77M (Izdeliye 180) and possibly a ramjet powered K-77ME (Izdeliye 180-BD)?@Firezstarter1 @zone5aviation @hvtiaf pic.twitter.com/izpdFsP4WK&mdash; Sameer Joshi (@joe_sameer) October 5, 2020 While there is still more to learn about the Su-57’s wing-root weapons bays, it’s meanwhile clear that Russia is busy exploring the integration of new weapons on the aircraft. This has very likely also included combat trials of weapons in Ukraine, on a more extensive basis than was the case during the Felon’s very brief operational, or semi-operational deployment to Syria. The appearance of the Su-57 at Airshow China is also notable, with Russia clearly trying to drum up export interest in the fighter, which has so far secured only 76 orders from the Russian Ministry of Defense. Plans to jointly develop a version of the Felon for the Indian Air Force collapsed when India dramatically walked away from the program in 2018. Since then, the Su-57 has been pitched unsuccessfully to Turkey, while Algeria, Egypt, and Vietnam — as traditional buyers of Russian military technology — have all been suggested as possible customers. Securing a foreign customer is very likely a prerequisite for Sukhoi completing the development of the improved Su-57M version, which is planned to be fitted with more powerful engines for enhanced performance. In the meantime, continued weapons testing is helping move the Su-57 closer to a true operational capability. Whatever way they work, it appears the wing-root bays will be a fundamental part of the Felon’s frontline armory, providing a valuable boost to its overall weapons capacity and possibly introducing a capable new short-range air-to-air missile in the process.

Russia Firing Record Number Of Shahed-136s At Ukraine	Russian forces are launching about 10 times as many Shahed-136 drones against Ukraine as they did last fall, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Telegram Monday. Moscow 'has ramped up drone strikes on Kyiv and the rest of the country, while decreasing the use of more powerful and harder-to-intercept cruise and ballistic missiles,' the Kyiv Independent reported. 'We must fully counter them,' Zelensky said following the meeting with top Ukrainian officials. russia is now using about ten times as many 'Shaheds' as last fall, – Zelenskyy said after the Headquarters meeting.Key reports: strengthening air defense in the regions that need it most; development of new solutions in the fight against guided bombs; reinforcement… pic.twitter.com/dvV33Fu9oz&mdash; BLYSKAVKA (@blyskavka_ua) November 4, 2024 On Nov. 3, the Ukrainian Air Force said that Russia 'attacked with one Kh-59/69 guided air missile from the airspace of the Kursk region and 96 Shahed drones. Meanwhile, as they increase their use of Shahed drones, the Russians are 'stockpiling missiles and have begun to use more decoys,' according to Ukrainian military and political analyst Oleksandr Kovalenko. 'In total, over the past month, the enemy used 84 missiles of various types, which is almost two times less than in September (151),' he stated on Telegram. 'At the same time, 15 were intercepted (versus 48 missiles in September).' Last month, 'the Russian occupiers did not carry out massive missile strikes on Ukraine - as, in general, in September,' he noted. 'But there were regular single strikes - with frequent use of Kh-59/69 and 9M723 missiles.' During October, 'not a single launch of the 9M728 Iskander-K OTRK [cruise missile] was recorded, while the enemy regularly used the 9M723 Iskander-M/KN-23 OTRK [ballistic missiles],' Kovalenko added, noting that there was a similar pause in the use of Kh-101/555 air-launched cruise missiles and the Kalibr sea-launched cruise missiles. 'But this does not mean that the Russian occupation forces have run out of them, but indicates their accumulation,' he posited. Russia is very likely saving its missiles for massive attacks on Ukraine's already-imperiled electrical grid during the cold winter months when they will have the most effect on morale. Russia did not attack Ukraine with Kh-101 missiles for 61 days: they are stockpiling until winter, - TrackingDuring this period, they could produce at least 120 missiles of this type; At the 'Olenya/Engels-2' - 15 Tu-95MS. pic.twitter.com/ancoaI0e3F&mdash; MAKS 24 (@Maks_NAFO_FELLA) November 4, 2024 Zelensky pointed out that there are a large amount of foreign components in these drones. 'Such a massive number of Shaheds requires over 170,000 individual components that should have been blocked from reaching Russia,' Zelensky commented. 'They come from companies in China, Europe, and America—lots of small but constant contributions to Russia’s terror.' This ongoing supply chain 'highlights, yet again, the urgent need for the world to step up export controls on special components and resources,' he added. 'Russia must not be allowed to circumvent sanctions that were imposed long ago in response to this war. Sanctions must increase and be effective. Every scheme to bypass sanctions is a crime against people and the world. These very schemes also enable Russia to strengthen regimes in Iran and North Korea. This is a global threat, and only global, unified pressure can overcome it.' Russia is gradually ramping up its daily attacks with Shahed drones and missiles, still using Western components to do so. In October alone, over 2,000 Shaheds were launched against Ukraine—almost every single day. Such a massive number of Shaheds requires over 170,000 individual… pic.twitter.com/sCBt5crgQU&mdash; Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa) November 2, 2024 Last month, Russians used 2,023 'Shahed' drones as well as those 'of an unspecified type' on civilian and military facilities in Ukraine, the Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff claimed on Telegram last week. 'Of them, 1,185 were destroyed/suppressed by Ukrainian defenders and another 29 UAVs left the controlled airspace of our country. In general, since the beginning of 2024, the enemy launched 6,987 attack UAVs on the territory of Ukraine. Mostly enemy drones targeted the civilian and critical infrastructure of Ukraine.' While having 29% of all long-range one-way attack launched at Ukraine this year fired in the past month is a stunning figure, Kovalenko suggested that number also included some decoys. The 'professionalism and skill of the servicemen of the Defense Forces' saved 'thousands of lives of our people from the Russian air terror, to protect hundreds of homes of Ukrainian citizens and important state objects from destruction,' the General Staff explained. I’ve been in #Kyiv for the last week of October - the sleep-robbing Shahed attacks are relentless. While most are shot down, the psychological impact is like living with a malevolently colicky (and occasionally lethal) baby waking you up several times a night - with no cuddles. Roman Waschuk (@WaschukCanUA) November 1, 2024 Overnight into Monday, Russia launched 80 Shaheds, according to Ukrainian Member of Parliament Lesia Vasylenko.

'Starlink can be needed by the enemy in order to transmit intelligence, for example, collected by radio equipment regarding the positions of Ukrainian air defense,' the publication surmised. 'Or, in the case of equipping the drone with cameras - images. And thanks to Starlink, the Russian Federation can use Shahed as an extremely long-range [drone] with the possibility of reconnaissance, due to an additional camera, and defeat even moving targets.' The use of enhanced Shaheds to hunt and kill even moving targets far behind the front lines is something we first discussed back in February. We contacted SpaceX for comment and will update this story with any pertinent response provided. ‘Ukraine Discovers Starlink on Downed Russian Shahed Drone: Report’ Hans de Vreij (@hdevreij) October 28, 2024 As we previously reported, Russia is using densely packed waves of Shaheds to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses. Now one of Russia's new long-range Gerbera drones, likely serving as a decoy during a mass Shahed drone attack, was captured on video being intercepted by a Ukrainian drone. Like the Shahed, the new drone has a relatively large delta wing, although with prominently cranked leading edges. Rather than vertical stabilizers on the wingtips as on the Geran, the Gerbera has a conventional single vertical tailfin, located just ahead of the single pusher propeller driven by an internal combustion engine.

'Counter-intelligence of the Security Service detained an enemy henchman who worked for the military-industrial complex of the Russian Federation in Kharkiv,' SBU claimed. 'He turned out to be a 72-year-old scientist-mechanic who, on the order of the Rashists, developed drawings for the improvement of Shahed-type kamikaze drones. In particular, he worked on the modernization of engines and catapult installations.' According to the investigation, 'the suspect remotely transferred technological developments to his acquaintance, the general director of one of the Russian machine-building plants, which produces units for drones.' Since 2023, that company has 'been closely cooperating with the Russian company, which is engaged in the production of shock drones of the ‘Shahed’ type, which the Russians label under the name ‘Geran-2.’' The suspect 'used e-mail and a popular messenger to communicate with Russian accomplices. At the same time, he disguised cooperation with the occupiers under the guise of preparing scientific papers in the field of UAVs,' SBU avered. 'As the investigation established, the scientist involved in the project worked with his former student, who fled from Kharkiv Oblast to the Russian Federation at the beginning of the full-scale war. There he got a job at the Moscow University of Technology, where he develops drones for the Russian Armed Forces.' During the search, 'computer equipment, a mobile phone and flash drives with evidence of subversive activities in favor of the Russian Federation were seized from him,' according to SBU. The suspect 'is in custody. He faces 12 years in prison with confiscation of property.' Initially, Russia received its Shahed drones from Iran. Last month, Ukraine said it hit a warehouse storing about 400 Shaheds that exploded in the attack, according to Radio Liberty. Earlier this year, we told you about the new factory in Russia producing Shaheds. The increasing waves of these drones used to attack Ukraine may be an indication of that facility's output. What remains unclear is what components are still be sourced through Iran and if Israel's air strikes would hamper the delivery of those subsystems if they are indeed still coming from Iran. The Latest On the battlefield, Russian forces continue to press deeper into Ukrainian defenses. The latest Institute for the Study of War (ISW) assessment offers details about these advances. Kursk Oblast: Russian forces reportedly recently advanced in the main Ukrainian salient in Kursk Oblast amid continued fighting on November 3. Speaking to reporters Monday afternoon, including from The War Zone, the Pentagon's top spokesman Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Russia hasn't made any significant gains in Kursk. Kharkiv Oblast: The Russians continued limited offensive operations northeast of Kharkiv City near Vovchansk and Hatyshche (northwest of Vovchansk) on November 2 and 3 but did not advance. Luhansk Oblast: Moscow’s troops recently advanced west of Svatove and northwest of Kreminna amid continued offensive operations along the Kupyansk-Svatove-Kreminna line on November 3. 'Geolocated footage published on November 3 indicates that Russian forces recently advanced on the eastern outskirts of Andriivka (west of Svatove) and in northern Terny (northwest of Kreminna),' according to ISW. Donetsk: Russian forces recently launched a battalion-sized mechanized assault southeast of Siversk and marginally advanced. 'Geolocated footage published on November 2 shows Ukrainian forces repelling a Russian battalion-sized mechanized assault involving around 120 Russian servicemen, seven tanks, 13 infantry fighting vehicles (BMPs), and two MT-LB amphibious armored personnel carriers northeast of Vesele and south of Ivano-Darivka (both southeast of Siversk),' ISW reported. The geolocated footage 'indicates that Russian forces marginally advanced in the areas northeast of Vesele and south Ivano-Darivka. Russian forces reportedly continued assaults in Chasiv Yar and south of Chasiv Yar near Predtechnyne on November 2 and 3 but did not advance. They also continued offensive operations north of Kurakhove near Novoselydivka, Novodmytrivka, and Kreminna Balka; northeast of Kurakhove near Hostre, Vovchanka, and Illinka; and east of Kurakhove near Maksymilyanivka. Russian forces recently advanced northeast and northwest of Vuhledar amid continued offensive operations on November 2 and 3.

That's an increase from the 7,200 Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Directorate, told us were there last week. Pyongyang, as we were the first to report, has sent some 12,000 troops to aid Russia’s fight against Ukraine, according to Budanov. In another sign of the burgeoning Moscow-Pyongyang relationship, Russian President Vladimir Putin met with North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui in the Kremlin on Monday, Moscow announced. Choe has been in Russia for a week and has pledged that North Korea would stand by Russia until its 'victory' in Ukraine, according to The Moscow Times. 'President Putin received the foreign minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Choe Son Hui,' the Kremlin said in a statement, publishing a video of the pair shaking hands ahead of talks. That statement comes on the heels of one Choe made last week, saying: 'From the very beginning of the war, our esteemed comrade Kim Jong-un instructed us to consistently and powerfully support and assist the Russian army in their holy war.'

One North Korean soldier surrendered to the Ukrainians.&mdash; InsideNK/GeoPolitics (@inside_nk) October 30, 2024 The presence of so many North Korean troops in Russia has sparked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to call for greater intelligence sharing with South Korea. 'There is only one conclusion,' Zelensky said he told South Korean President Yun Seok-yeol on Sunday. 'This war is internationalized and goes beyond the borders of two states.' In addition, the two leaders 'agreed to strengthen the exchange of intelligence and expertise, to intensify contacts at all levels, including the highest, in order to develop an action strategy and a list of countermeasures in response to escalation,' Zelensky stated. In addition, he called for both nations 'to involve mutual partners in cooperation. Within the framework of this agreement, Ukraine and the Republic of Korea will soon exchange delegations to coordinate actions.' Last week, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Russian forces 'have trained the North Korean soldiers in artillery operations, unmanned aerial vehicle operations and basic infantry tactics to include trench clearing.' The Kremlin, he added, 'has also provided these [North Korean] troops with Russian uniforms and equipment, and all of that strongly indicates that Russia intends to use these foreign forces in frontline operations in its war of choice against Ukraine.' 'Make no mistake,' Austin posited. 'If these North Korean troops engage in combat or combat support operations against Ukraine, they would make themselves legitimate military targets,' the secretary said. Just days after complaining that Ukraine has received only 10% of the military aid promised by allies, President Volodymyr Zelensky offered some positive news on that front. 'There are important developments in the matter of supply from partners for the front - we are recording an increase in supply according to support packages,' Zelensky said Monday on Telegram.

CIA Has Secret 'Nonviolent' Way To Disable Large Ships: Report	The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency reportedly has at least one mysterious system capable of 'covertly (and nonviolently)' disabling ships, including very large ones. The secret system is said to have been considered for use against fuel tankers sailing between Venezuela and Cuba during President Donald Trump's term in office. A mention of the CIA ship-disabling system is included in a detailed exposé about the Trump administration's unsuccessful efforts to overthrow dictatorial Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro that Wired published on October 31 and is worth reading in full. The report describes a host of efforts that the U.S. government and foreign partners undertook to try to unseat Maduro between 2018 and 2020. This includes a cyber attack on the payroll system for Venzeuzla's armed forces, sabotage raids by Colombian operatives targeting the Venezuelan Air Force's Russian-made Sukhoi Su-30 fighters, and support for opposition leader Juan Guaido's attempt to overthrow Maduro's government. President Donald Trump, at left, and Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, at right, at the White House on February 5, 2020. Mark Wilson/Getty Images 'Cuba relies on oil from Venezuela. In return, US officials believe, the Cuban security services have helped protect Maduro, essentially serving as an on-the-ground praetorian guard for the embattled socialist autocrat,' per Wired's report. 'The Trump administration thought if the US could somehow intercept or sabotage the oil ships sailing from Venezuela to Cuba, it could strike a blow against both regimes.' 'At least one option involved the CIA, which had a mobile system that could covertly (and nonviolently) disable ships. Trump administration officials wanted the agency to move the system near Venezuela, to hit some of its fuel tankers,' the story continues. 'The agency balked. CIA officials explained that it only had one of these systems, that it was currently in another hemisphere, and they didn’t want to move it to the northern end of South America. The idea was shelved.' An oil tanker and other ships are seen off the coast of Venezuela in January 2024. GUSTAVO GRANADO/AFP via Getty Images No specific details about the CIA's ship-stopping system, including its 'nonviolent' method of function, are provided in Wired's piece, but there are some clear possibilities. What comes to mind first is the possibility that the system in question creates the intended effects by pumping out bursts of high-power microwave (HPM) energy. This could allow for the destruction, disabling, or disruption of key systems, such as radars, computerized navigation gear, communications suites, steering systems, and electronic engine control systems, in turn stopping a vessel, but also leaving its crew unharmed. 'HPM weapons create invisible beams of electromagnetic energy within a specific spectrum of radio and microwave frequencies that can cause a range of temporary or permanent effects on electronic targets. Examples include non-kinetic disabling of computer systems, damaging targeted electronics, disrupting security and industrial control systems, etc,' a 2023 press release related to a U.S. Air Force/U.S. Navy program called High-power Joint Electromagnetic Non-Kinetic Strike (HiJENKS) explains. 'Electromagnetic energy from an HPM weapon can couple to an electronic target directly through a transmit or receive element (like an antenna), or indirectly, through an aperture or cable points of entry (e.g., cracks, seams, external wires). Currents and voltages can be induced in target circuitry, resulting in erroneous signals, system lock-up, system failure, and/or physical damage.' Publicly available details about HiJENKS remain limited, but this capability was successfully demonstrated at least once during a live-fire test event at the Navy's sprawling China Lake test center in 2022. HiJENKS also follows on from the similarly secretive Counter-Electronics High-Power Advanced Microwave Project (CHAMP) missile containing an HPM generator payload, which Boeing is understood to have delivered at least a small number of to the Air Force. The U.S. military is also known to have at least funded work in the past on lower-tier HPM systems designed to stop smaller watercraft, as well as vehicles, including ones rigged up as suicide bombs, on land. A 2016 briefing slide discussing HPM 'vehicle and vessel stopper' work at that time and plans for future developments. USN via FOIA An HPM-based system could require getting the source relatively close to the target, which might also be difficult to do covertly. Employing uncrewed aerial or maritime platforms, or disguised 'civilian' ones, configured to launch an 'attack' of this kind would potentially offer ways to reduce the chance of detection and/or attribution. A nuclear submarine-based capability is also possible. The CIA's ship-stopping system might also be capable of launching some other kind of highly-targeted electronic or cyber warfare attack to produce broadly similar effects. An electronic attack that blinds key sensors and communications could stop or slow a vessel. A cyber attack could disable key industrial control systems on a ship, bringing it to a halt, but it would require a vector to breach those systems externally from the vessel. All of this evokes the memory of still unsubstantiated reports of the U.S. government's use of less-than-lethal 'stun bombs' in Libya in 2011 and 'electricity bombs' in Syria in 2017. The War Zone previously explored the potential legitimacy of those claims, including as evidence of novel directed energy and/or electronic/cyber warfare attacks, as well as other possibilities, in detail. 6/ When plane wants to drop electricity bomb, we are told to drop anything metal that we carry. Otherwise we also burn like ISIS fighters.&mdash; Jenan Moussa (@jenanmoussa) July 7, 2017 Some kind of physical mode of attack, such as one that causes an obstruction to certain features of ship, including elements of its propulsion system and rudders, and that doesn't cause permanent damage, could be another option. Systems designed to slow or stop a vessel by fouling its propellers do exist, as seen in the video below, though they are generally intended for use against smaller watercraft. Prop foulers have been used to disable larger ships, but usually during harassment activities with a ship towing a long chain with floaters on it or other improvised obstruction mechanisms. It's possible an unmanned craft could be adapted for this, but those are very dynamic operations that require a lot of situational awareness to pull off successfully. Innocuous accidents involving ship propellers getting tangled up in a fishing net also do just happen. A system designed to initiate a physical less-than-lethal attack sufficient enough to hamper the movement of a large ship like an oil tanker, and doing so covertly, seems less likely than the aforementioned, less physically invasive options. Getting an obstructing device of some kind successfully in place discreetly, especially in front of or on a vessel in motion, could present significant challenges. It's unknown whether or not the CIA has expanded its inventory of the system that Wired reported on in recent years or has any other similar ones in its toolkit now. The fact that there was just one, at least at the time, points to a somewhat exotic and/or experimental capability. The CIA is certainly well-known at this point for developing or supporting the development of novel means of targeting adversaries, lethally and non-lethally. For instance, the Agency had a hand in the development of the specialized low-collateral damage AGM-114R9X version of the Hellfire missile, which features an array of pop-out knife-like blades rather than a high-explosive warhead. The details from Wired's story that the CIA 'only had one of these systems, that it was currently in another hemisphere, and they didn’t want to move it,' are also very interesting regardless of how the reported ship-stopping capability works. This would seem to point to the system in question being forward deployed outside of the Western Hemisphere already, and possibly with a very specific target set in mind. This might also indicate a reticence to potentially expose what this system can do absent an especially serious crisis or very high priority, clandestine operations.

JUAN BARRETO/AFP via Getty Images Regardless of its specific mode of function, it is not at all hard to see how a covert and less-than-lethal ship-stopping capability would be highly attractive. For instance, it could be of great use for visit, board, search, and seizure (VBSS) operations. Stopping a ship, and even possibly cutting off its sensors and power, could make boarding and seizing control over it much easier. In areas where a VBSS or other special operations boarding teams are not present and will take too much time to there, such a system could stall the ship in preferred waters until critical capabilities arrive. Beyond just making a raid easier and safer, this all could be especially useful for responding on very short notice to top-priority actionable intelligence, such as alerts about the smuggling of particularly worrisome cargoes like nuclear material. There are many other applications, as well. When used against military vessels, we are talking about taking the ship offline, or at least stopping it from moving and leaving it more vulnerable without firing a shot. Altogether, while Wired's report provides limited details, the ship-stopping capability described therein would make good sense for the U.S. government to have up its sleeve.

German Navy Confirms Its Supersized Frigate Will Avoid The Red Se...	A German Navy warship is returning from an extensive deployment to the Indo-Pacific region via the Cape of Good Hope, avoiding a potentially hazardous passage through the Red Sea, a German Ministry of Defense spokesperson has confirmed to The War Zone. The frigate Baden-Württemberg, together with the replenishment ship Frankfurt am Main, will take the long route around Africa, due to the dangers in the Red Sea — primarily the ongoing anti-shipping campaign by Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi militants. German Air Force Eurofighter EF2000s fly over the frigate Baden-Württemberg off the coast of Hawaii during the joint exercises Pacific Skies 2024 and Pacific Waves, on July 30, 2024. Bundeswehr/Francis Hildemann Francis Hildemann The German Ministry of Defense spokesperson told The War Zone that German Minister of Defense Boris Pistorius decided last week to reroute the two German Navy vessels that form the Indo-Pacific Deployment Task Group, 'based on a comprehensive assessment of the threat situation in relation to the air defense capabilities of both ships.' 'Due to the fact that Baden-Württemberg is not designed as a major air defender combat vessel, she is not able to provide an air defense umbrella for extended self-defense against air-breathing threats and to efficiently protect the supply vessel which is in company,' the same spokesperson added, before confirming that both ships had recently departed India. #MaritimePartnership #BridgesofFriendship#INSDelhi of the #SunriseFleet, Frigate Baden-Württemberg and Tanker Frankfurt Am Main of the #GermanNavy undertook their maiden #Maritimepartnership Exercise in the Indian Ocean including cross deck flying operations, underway… pic.twitter.com/9ByPKIjj2c&mdash; Eastern Naval Command (@IN_HQENC) October 24, 2024 While the German news magazine Spiegel had reported last week that the vessels would reroute, the source was not revealed and TWZ is, as fas as we know, first to get confirmation direct from the German Ministry of Defense. Taking the much longer route around the Cape of Good Hope will avoid potential attack by Houthi cruise missiles, aerial and maritime drones, and (non-air-breathing) ballistic missiles, but it also paints a concerning picture about the ability of the German Navy — and the allied task forces in the region — to provide adequate defenses. The German Navy does not currently have a unit in the Red Sea that could provide escort for the two ships, a situation that has existed since the F124 Sachsen class frigate Hessen departed the Red Sea for Germany in April, after two months deployed as part of the European Union’s Aspides mission. You can read more about that here. For air defense, the Sachsen class is armed with 32 Mk 41 vertical launch system (VLS) cells that are typically loaded with 24 SM-2 Block IIIA and 32 RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) surface-to-air missiles. There are also two RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) launchers for close-in defense, a single dual-purpose 76mm gun, and a pair of 27mm MLG 27 cannons. The frigate Hessen prepares to pull alongside the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman during a simulated fueling-at-sea, in the Mediterranean Sea in 2018. U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Kaysee Lohmann/Released MC3 Kaysee Lohmann In contrast, the air defense weaponry of the F125 Baden-Württemberg class frigate consists only of two RAM launchers, two 27mm MLG 27 cannons, and several heavy machine guns. Both F124 and F125 frigates can embark up to two Sea Lynx helicopters, which could potentially also be used to intercept drones in the air, something we have already seen happen in the Red Sea campaign.

As we have noted before, these odd destroyer-sized ships are built for 'stabilization, crisis management, conflict prevention, and international intervention operations.' 'What’s critically lacking here is any sort of area air defense capability,' we wrote back in 2017. 'For such a large surface combatant, lacking some sort of air defense capability beyond close-in weapon systems seems outright bizarre, especially considering the ship’s capable sensor suite.' Germany has managed to build a €650 mil, 10.000t frigate that is essentially useless for any but the most benign of operational environments. Anything above a Somali pirate skiff and the F-125 is in trouble. Georg ‘Tenured Maverick’ Löfflmann (@gloefflmann) October 29, 2024 The Type 702 Berlin class replenishment ship, of which Frankfurt am Main is one of two, has an anti-aircraft armament of four 27mm MLG 27 cannons, several heavy machine guns, plus provision for FIM-92 Stinger man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS), which are not known to be regularly carried. The Type 702 Berlin class replenishment ship Frankfurt am Main. Bundeswehr/Schönbrodt With that in mind, it’s certainly true that the two vessels of the Indo-Pacific Deployment Task Group are entirely inadequately protected against cruise missile and drone threats at any distance beyond the roughly 5.6-mile range of the RIM-116 RAM. While this close-in weapon system could potentially deal with these kinds of threats within this engagement range, it would be too risky to wait for the missile or drone to get so close to the ships before having the option to engage. This would be even more hazardous in an attack involving multiple cruise missiles and/or drones. Meanwhile, the two ships are entirely defenseless against ballistic missiles, including the anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBMs) that the Houthis began to use earlier this year. The Barbados-flagged, Liberian-owned bulk carrier M/V True Confidence after being hit by a Houthi anti-ship ballistic missile (ASBM) while transiting the Gulf of Aden, on March 6, 2024. The multinational crew reported three fatalities, at least four injuries, and significant damage to the ship. CENTCOM With no German Navy warship in the Red Sea that would be able to offer an enhanced level of air defense protection, it seems the decision was taken to avoid the area, although that does also raise questions about the availability of other allied warships there to provide the required air defense capabilities. According to the Spiegel, 'other nations operating with warships [in the Red Sea] reported that escort was currently not possible.' Two separate international task forces have been set up to defend Red Sea shipping. The U.S.-led Operation Prosperity Guardian, which The War Zone was the first to write about, was established last December. The European-led Operation Aspides followed two months later. The frigate Baden-Württemberg takes part in an ADEX (Air Defense Exercise) during its latest Indo-Pacific deployment, on May 31, 2024. Philipp Schäfer/Bundeswehr Philipp Schäfer This latest development does, however, suggest that these missions are less resourced overall than they were in the past. A contributing factor may also be the increased focus on Iran, especially for the United States right now. These operations have been broadly a tactical success, but there have also been questions about their long-term viability, also in relation to the prolonged stress that kinetic engagements put on stocks of precious weapons. In the meantime, the Houthi attacks have not stopped and the militants continue to be armed by Iran, while international shipping remains disrupted. While coalition vessels have been credited with shooting down numerous Houthi cruise missiles, drones, and ballistic missiles — using a very wide variety of weapons and non-kinetic systems to do so — there have also been incidents when these warships’ air defenses haven’t worked as well as planned. The Hessen 'repelled four attacks by the Houthi rebels,' according to the German Armed Forces, and also carried out 18 close escort missions, guiding '27 merchant ships with a total tonnage of 1.3 million tons safely through the danger zone.' Accompanied by a Sea Lynx helicopter, the frigate Hessen enters the port of Wilhelmshaven after its mission in the Red Sea, on May 5, 2024.

More embarrassing was the performance of the Royal Danish Navy, whose frigate Iver Huitfeldt suffered radar and air defense missile system failures during a Houthi drone attack. In particular, it was reported that the warship was unable to fire its RIM-162 ESSM for a half-hour period, while 'up to half' of the rounds fired from the twin 76mm guns detonated too early and close to the ship. Nevertheless, the Iver Huitfeldt was able to shoot down four of the incoming drones, while the remainder were tackled by other vessels. The Danish warship also saw its deployment cut short and contributed to the sacking of the head of the Danish Armed Forces.

Photo by Ida Marie Odgaard / Ritzau Scanpix / AFP / Denmark OUT IDA MARIE ODGAARD These incidents demonstrate the very real challenges of countering the Houthi anti-shipping campaign, something that is also putting considerable demands on available weapons stocks. At the same time, while the losses inflicted on shipping by the Houthis have been limited, their campaign has continued, and it has forced many commercial shipping companies to avoid the Red Sea route. This has knock-on effects on the global supply chain, driving up costs and adding delays. The Houthis have even extended the scope of their campaign, with new tactics and an extended radius over which they can launch their attacks. This only increases the burden on the multinational task forces, which require more warships and munitions to counter the militants’ attacks. The War Zone recently examined reports that the Houthis are also receiving help from Russia in their attacks. After sailing from there toward South Africa and then heading north, the Baden-Württemberg is expected to enter the Mediterranean, to join the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon or UNIFIL peacekeeping mission, while Frankfurt am Main will return to Germany. German Minister of Defense Boris Pistorius on board the German frigate Baden-Württemberg during the U.S.-led military exercise Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise earlier this year. Photo by Soeren Stache/picture alliance via Getty Images picture alliance In the meantime, Germany is continuing to participate in the European-led Operation Aspides mission in the Red Sea, with a contingent of staff at the Force Headquarters and on board the Italian flagship. In addition, Germany is providing an undisclosed aircraft for long-range reconnaissance in support of the Aspides mission. The aircraft is flown by a civilian company but operated partly by military personnel. 'Germany will continue to make substantial contributions to Aspides,' the spokesperson from the German Ministry of Defense told TWZ. 'The contribution of warships at Aspides must be weighed against other operational commitments of the German Navy and is closely coordinated with our partners and the European Union. This process is ongoing and has not yet been finalized.' The same concerns that TWZ and others have raised about the missing air defense capability of the F125 Baden-Württemberg class have driven the decision for one of these frigates to avoid the Red Sea. As well as once again challenging the logic of the design of this warship, this is another reminder of the continuing threat posed to vessels of all kinds as the Houthis continue their anti-shipping campaign.

Ukrainian Defenses In The East Are Buckling, Russian Advance Is A...	Ukraine’s defenses in the Donetsk region are continuing to crumble. In the past week alone, the Russians have gained more land than at any point this year. 'The gain of more than 200 square kilometers (77 square miles) adds to territory taken in a grinding summer offensive that’s involved huge losses of Russian troops and equipment,' Bloomberg News reported, citing maps compiled by the DeepState open-source intelligence group's map service maintained in cooperation with the Ukrainian Defense Ministry. 'Russia has captured 1,146 square kilometers in Ukraine since Aug. 6, about a quarter more than in the first seven months of the year.' Russian Army advances in Ukraine this year (2024). pic.twitter.com/Gy1Jva4Biv&mdash; Clash Report (@clashreport) October 29, 2024 The Russians are chewing up large chunks of Donetsk in a move to capture the key logistics hub of Pokrovsk which could lead to a further breakout west toward Dnipropetrovsk and south toward Zaporizhia. Having captured the town of Selydovo earlier this week - its biggest regional prize since seizing Avdiikva - Russian forces are now pushing toward Kurakhov. Sitting astride the N-15 highway, the settlement is just south of a mile-wide stretch of the Vovcha River and supports the movement of troops and materiel in the region. As such, it is a bulwark on a Russian advance toward Pokrovsk about 20 miles to the north. Russian forces are now less than three miles from Kurakhov, according to DeepState. Control of that city is key to a pocket of Ukrainian-held territory that Russia is pushing toward from the north, east and south. A Russian mechanized column 'has already pushed into the city’s eastern outskirts..,' the independent Russian Meduza media outlet reported. 'Additional Russian units are pressing in from the north (from the direction of Selydove), and from the south (from the direction of Vuhledar),' which as we previously reported was captured early last month. 'Ukrainian defenses to the south of the city appear especially weak,' Meduza added. 'After a chaotic retreat from Vuhledar, the brigades seem worn out, and even reinforcements sent from Zaporizhzhia haven’t been enough to help.' As Meduza and other media outlets have noted, the advances 'are not without [Russian] equipment losses along the way.' Defenders managed to hold the encroachment at bay in part because of a line of dragon’s teeth that impeded the Russians, according to the Ukrainian Militarnyi outlet. A Russian armored convoy tried to break through this line of fortifications, but Ukrainian paratroopers of the 46th Separate Airmobile Brigade stopped it, the outlet reported, citing the brigade’s Telegram channel. The Russians were trying to bypass the road through a field from occupied Maksymilianivka towards Kurakhov. The brigade claimed that four Russian armored vehicles and two tanks in the assault were destroyed by 'artillery fire, FPV-drones, and remote-mining means.' Russian armor destroyed attacking Kurakhove. (46th Separate Airmobile Brigade screencap) Still, the defense of Kurakov is becoming increasingly difficult. 'The situation is really tense,' Orest Drymalovsky, a representative of the press service of Ukraine’s 79th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade said on national television, according to Radio Liberty’s Telegram. 'The enemy is trying to probe our defense every day. Every day they strike, every day they attack to break through the defense of the 79th Brigade and to encircle the city of Kurakhov even deeper.' Drmyalovsky added that the Russians 'are sending entire columns of equipment and personnel in the direction of the village of Konstantinovka near Kurakhov, and they are not sparing either soldiers or equipment.' 'Apparently, it is very important for the occupiers to straighten the front line in the Kurakhov direction, to push through the defense of the 79th Paratroopers in the area of ​​the villages of Konstantinovka, Antonovka, Yekaterinovka, where the enemy has not had success for a long time,' Drymalovskiy noted about settlements less than seven miles south of Kurakhove. 'And without this success, the occupiers will not be able to advance closer to the city of Kurakhov.' Russian sources, however, claim that at least part of that area has been captured. Ukraine 'has been knocked out' of Ilyinka,' according to noted Russian milblogger Yuriy Podolyak. That is a small settlement less than a half-mile north of Yekaterinovka. 'We are waiting for confirmation,' he added. 'What a great day. Kurakhov is quickly losing its significance for Ukraine.' 'According to preliminary information, Ilyinka and Stepanovka have been liberated by the Russian Army as part of the Russian Armed Forces' advance north of Kurakhov,' the Russian Warrior Kitten Telegram channel posited. Despite the Russian claims, the latest DeepState map shows that all five of those towns remain in Ukrainian hands. 'Fighting in the Kurakhov direction continues,' the Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff stated on Facebook. Near 'Ostrivsky, Illinka, Novoselidivka, Kremínnoí̈ Balka, Novodmitrivka, Vovchenko, Maximilyanivka, Dalnyi, Antonivka and Katerinivka, 24 combat clashes took place during the day, 13 attacks by the occupiers are ongoing.' There have been two dozen battles near Kurakhove today with more than half ongoing, according to the Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff. (Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff) Regardless of exactly where Russian troops are on the southern end of their push toward Kurakhov, their objective of taking the town appears to be gaining traction. Its fall would mark the latest in a string of defeats Ukraine has experienced in Donetsk against an increasingly overwhelming adversary that is willing to sacrifice large amounts of troops and equipment in the process. The Russian push is not limited to Pokrovsk. It is attacking all across Donetsk to press its advantage in personnel. Moscow is recruiting about 30,000 troops a month, according to The Economist, citing a NATO official. 'That is less than government targets, but is still enough to cover even the gargantuan losses of recent months,' the publication noted. 'On manpower, too, Russia remains solvent. Its army is recruiting around 30,000 men per month, says the nato official. That is not enough to meet internal targets, says another official, but it is adequate to cover even the gargantuan losses of recent months.'… pic.twitter.com/HAL6LcRtm4&mdash; Rob Lee (@RALee85) October 30, 2024 In addition to increasing the number of its own troops, Russia is seeing an influx of North Korean soldiers. As Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, head of the Ukrainian Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR) told us, there are some 12,000 North Korean troops in Russia, a figure that we noted could expand. Of those, about 7,200 are now in Kursk, Budanov told The War Zone on Friday. It is unclear at the moment how many North Korean troops might be sent into Ukraine or if more might be sent to bolster Russia's fight. Ukraine too is seeking to quickly bolster its forces. 'A further 160,000 people are to be drafted into the Ukrainian armed forces, which will raise the manning of units to 85%, National Security and Defense Council Secretary Oleksandr Lytvynenko said on Oct. 29 during a session of the Ukrainian parliament,' the Kyiv Independent reported. Ukraine's parliament adopted an updated mobilization law in mid-April to ramp up mobilization amid Russia's ongoing war, according to the outlet. 'The new law simplifies the process for identifying eligible conscripts and includes additional penalties for those dodging the draft. According to Lytvynenko, 1,000,050 citizens have been drafted into the military so far since the beginning of martial law.' Ukraine is set to mobilize around 160,000 troops over the next three months. pic.twitter.com/a9jxt8iXEq&mdash; Clash Report (@clashreport) October 29, 2024 With the speed and scope of this push picking up, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has increased the urgency of his complaints about Western support. 'Ukraine has received only 10% of the aid package approved by the U.S. Congress in 2024,' he said. 'This isn’t funny. The issue isn’t money, it’s bureaucracy and logistics.'

North Korea’s New ICBM May Have Biggest Transporter-Erector-Launc...	North Korea has tested an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that it claims is its longest-ranged so far — and which is carried on an absolutely enormous transporter-erector-launcher (TEL) vehicle. The announcement of the test of the Hwasong-19 comes amid large-scale U.S.-South Korean military maneuvers during which their aircraft have bombed mock-ups of North Korean ballistic missile launchers. These same exercises have also seen, for the first time, U.S. and South Korean drones working together to hunt targets — something that would be critical in a full-scale war to find and knock out North Korean missile launchers as quickly as possible. VIDEO: North Korean state media published footage of the launch of a new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) model called the 'Hwasong-19' on Thursday. Read more here: pic.twitter.com/CXXlBJX7O5&mdash; NK NEWS (@nknewsorg) November 1, 2024 A video and photos of the test of the Hwasong-19 published by the state-run Korean Central News Agency, or KCNA show a huge solid-fuel, multi-stage missile launched from a canister carried by the huge TEL vehicle, in an undisclosed forested location. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in front of the Hwasong-19 transporter-erector-launcher (TEL). KCNA KCNA Launch of the Hwasong-19. KCNA The size of the TEL is immediately impressive. With 11 axles, it’s notably longer than the nine-axle TEL used in the previous Hwasong-18, indicating that the missile is proportionally longer, too. Moreover, the relatively narrow driver cabs at the front of the Hwasong-19 vehicle also point to a larger-diameter missile. While North Korea has used an 11-axle TEL before, for its Hwasong-17, this missile was a less advanced liquid-fuel missile design. That TEL also didn't feature the smaller cab for the wider missile body as seen in the Hwasong-19's TEL setup. One of the notably narrow driver cabs at the front of the Hwasong-19 TEL vehicle.

As in previous similar tests, the missile was fired at a steep lofted trajectory to stay close to the Korean peninsula, although if flown on a standard trajectory it would be capable of reaching cities across the U.S. mainland.

The duration of the flight compares to 74 minutes for the last ICBM test 10 months ago, suggesting that the missile carries more fuel or that North Korea has improved the technology used in its solid-fuel rocket propellants.

Kim was again accompanied by his daughter to observe the launch, according to North Korean state media. Personnel involved in the missile test pose in front of the Hwasong-19. KCNA South Korean reaction to the test was swift, with Seoul imposing new sanctions on 11 North Korean individuals and four entities, which it says have contributed to missile and nuclear development, including by channeling illegal foreign funds into the country. North Korea has already demonstrated ICBMs with long enough range to hit targets almost anywhere in the United States, but the appearance of the Hwasong-19 demonstrates that the country is continuing to develop and refine these weapons — as well as use them to signal its military might. At the same time, it should be noted that questions still remain over the reliability of North Korean reentry vehicles and nuclear warheads. There is also the question of just how survivable the Hwasong-19 would be, simply due to its size. Its colossal dimensions mean there is only a limited number of places, including tunnels and some structures, where it can hide and the vehicle itself will be harder to maneuver than smaller TELs. Typically, super-heavy ICBMs of this kind are based in fixed silos, rather than being road-mobile. Reportedly, North Korea will field the Hwasong-19 alongside the previous Hwasong-18, which was its first solid-fuel ICBM, with analysts suggesting that the new missiles will offer an expanded capacity within a larger payload section. This would imply plans for it to carry larger warheads and multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs). The Hwasong-18 ICBM was first tested in April 2023. KCNA As we have discussed before, solid-fuel ICBMs, in general, offer huge advantages over previous liquid-fuel designs developed by North Korea. A solid-fuel missile can be brought into action far more quickly since it doesn’t need to be fueled before being launched, drastically reducing reaction time from receiving the order to launching. It also makes the missile much more survivable, dramatically reducing the window in which it could be targeted by a preemptive strike. The latest test not only confirms the continued maturation of North Korea’s strategic missile forces, and with it a growing deterrent capability, but also appears calculated to send a message to the United States, in particular. The timing of this messaging is notable for several reasons. Most immediately, the U.S. military and South Korean armed forces have been engaged in maneuvers in which aircraft — including drones — have been used to attack simulated North Korean targets. For the first time, these exercises have also involved drones from both countries. Today, the South Korean armed forces announced live-fire drills that saw U.S. Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drones drop GPS-guided munitions on targets while a Republic of Korea Air Force RQ-4B Global Hawk drone carried out intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR).

ROK Air Force As we have discussed in the past, any military campaign launched by the South against its neighbor would see extensive involvement by drones, which would be especially valuable for scouting for mobile targets, especially missile launchers, as well as keeping tabs on North Korean military movements on the ground. Meanwhile, U.S. and South Korean fighters also took part in the simulated bombing of North Korean targets — including ballistic missile launchers — on October 30, with 110 aircraft reportedly involved in the Freedom Flag 24-1 maneuvers. 'Through this large-scale joint air training exercise, we have demonstrated the South Korea-U.S. combined defense capability and posture to overwhelm the enemy in response to North Korea’s nuclear and missile threats,' South Korea’s joint chiefs of staff said in a statement.

ROK Air Force Meanwhile, North Korea finds itself even more ostracized from the international community due to its support for Russia in its war in Ukraine, which now includes the direct involvement of soldiers from the Korean People’s Army. Neither Pyongyang nor Moscow have denied that North Korean soldiers are now fighting on the front lines in Ukraine, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has slammed his allies for having made 'zero' response to the development. North Korea’s deepening support for Russia’s war in Ukraine — which has also seen it transfer millions of rounds of artillery ammunition and short-range ballistic missiles — has sparked concerns that sensitive military technology could flow back to Pyongyang from Moscow in return. In particular, there have been suggestions that North Korea might gain further advantages in its ballistic missile program, aided by Russia.

However, Austin did note that the U.S. Department of Defense was still at a very early point in its assessment of the missile test. It is perhaps also no coincidence that the Hwasong-19 comes as the United States prepares for its presidential election, on November 5. Earlier this year, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said that his personal connection with Kim would be an advantage that he would use if elected. 'Now North Korea is acting up again, but when we get back, I get along with him,' he said. 'He’d like to see me back, too. I think he misses me.' Returning to the peninsula, the missile test comes during a period of overall worsening tensions between North and South Korea. Most recently, TWZ reported on North Korea’s accusations that South Korea has been using drones to scatter propaganda leaflets over Pyongyang. That development follows waves of excrement and trash-filled balloons that North Korea has launched into the South, a campaign that started this summer. A photo released by the North Korean state news agency KCNA that claims to show a South Korean drone used to drop propaganda leaflets over the North Korean capital last month. KCNA Last month, the North said it said it would sever road and railway access to the South to ensure the two countries are 'completely separate.' A string of incidents and a continued war of words has served to raise tensions and, with them, the risk of an overreaction or a misunderstanding leading to a much more serious escalation. With that in mind, the test of the Hwasong-19 is a sobering reminder of the growing strength of the North Korean strategic arsenal, which has continued to develop despite longstanding sanctions and international pressure.

Army Coyote Drone Hunting Drones Have Scored 170 Combat Kills	The Army has racked up 170 kills with Coyote counter-drone interceptors in operational deployments globally. This underscores Coyote's centrality in the service's arsenal of systems to help tackle growing threats posed by uncrewed aerial systems. Army officials highlighted Coyote's achievements at the Falcon Peak 2025, a counter-drone capabilities demonstration at Peterson Space Force Base in Colorado this week, which The War Zone and reporters from other outlets observered. The service currently has Coyotes deployed at 36 unspecified sites outside of the United States. A Coyote Block 2 interceptor. Raytheon 'So we're in [the] CENTCOM region, AFRICOM, [and] EUCOM,' Army Maj. Alyssa Tallmadge from the service's Program Executive Office for Missiles and Space told The War Zone's Howard Altman on Wednesday, referring to the top U.S. military commands in the Middle East, Africa, and Europe. 'As we're over there for Coyotse, we're at 170 successful kills in all those regions.' At Falcon Peak 2025, Tallmadge did not provide a more specific breakdown of kills per region or whether Coyotes have scored kills everywhere they have been deployed. The War Zone has reached out for more information. Operational use of these interceptors, which defense contractor Raytheon produces, in the Middle East has been previously reported. Coyotes were also notably among the defensive capabilities deployed to protect a temporary pier attached to the shore of the Gaza Strip that the U.S. military briefly operated to try to help get more humanitarian aid into the enclave earlier this year. The primary versions of Coyote that the Army currently employs in the counter-drone role is the jet-powered Block 2 variant and its subtypes, which use a high-explosive warhead to destroy their targets. The service has also been looking to acquire Block 3 versions based on the original electric motor-driven pusher propeller design carrying unspecified 'non-kinetic' payloads, which might include electronic warfare systems or high-power RF pulse payloads. The interceptors are part of a larger system of systems in Army service collectively referred to as the Low, Slow, Unmanned Aircraft Integrated Defeat System (LIDS), which includes mobile (M-LIDS) and fixed-site (FS-LIDS) components. The mobile end of LIDS currently includes multiple configurations of 4×4 M-ATV mine-resistant vehicles, including ones armed with Coyotes and 30mm XM914 automatic cannons, as well as radars and other sensors. The Army is now pursuing a new M-LIDS platform that consolidates all of the existing capabilities onto a single 8&#215;8 Stryker light armored vehicle. FS-LIDS includes palletized Coyote launchers and sensor systems that can be rapidly emplaced, including at remote and austere forward locations. A promotional shot showing the FS-LIDS launcher and radar components, as well as an M-LIDS vehicle in the middle. Raytheon The LIDS system of systems can be integrated into larger air and missile defense ecosystems using various network architectures. The FS-LIDS components at Falcon Peak 2025 were linked to additional sensors via a Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2) system and other networks during the demonstration. It's worth noting here the Army is also in the process of fielding a new over-arching air and missile defense-focused network called Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS), which is expected to eventually subsume many existing systems like FAAD C2, as you can read more about here. A graphic showing a general concept of deploying M-LIDS and FS-LIDS in combination with other sensors, effectors, and networking capabilities. US Army A graphic showing a general concept of deploying M-LIDS and FS-LIDS in combination with other sensors, effectors, and networking capabilities. This also highlights the kinds of threats the Coyote-based counter-drone systems are mean to defend against. US Army As noted earlier, it has already been clear that Coyote, together with the rest of LIDS, occupies a central place in the Army's current counter-drone arsenal, and that this only looks set to grow in the near term. Last year, the service disclosed plans to buy as many as 6,000 Block 2 and 700 Block 3 Coyotes, as well as hundreds more launchers and radars, between Fiscal Years 2025 (which started on October 1 of this year) and 2029. Earlier this year, the Army further announced plans to establish nine new dedicated 'counter-small UAS (C-sUAS) batteries' as part of a broader force restructuring focused heavily on expanding air and missile defense capabilities and capacity. How those batteries might be equipped is unclear, but giving them combat-proven Coyote interceptors and the rest of LIDS would be obvious potential options. At the same time, the Army has stressed the importance of taking a broader, layered approach to defeating drone threats that requires a wider array of capabilities. 'When I was at the Joint Counter-UAS Office, we&#8230; helped field some of the Coyote interceptors,' Army Lt. Gen. Sean Gainey told The War Zone and the other reporters at Falcon Peak 2025 this week. 'But also we fielded directed energy type of systems [that] work very well in the counter-UAS space, anywhere from 10 kilowatt systems all the way up to 50 kilowatt systems. And we are employing those type of systems globally right now.' Gainey is currently head of the Army's Space and Missile Defense Command (SDMC). It is important to point out here that Army officials have publicly acknowledged significant issues with certain counter-drone laser directed weapons that have been deployed to date. Still, the service has remained publicly very interested in this kind of capability. An 8&#215;8 Stryker-based laser directed energy weapon, one of a number of such systems in limited US Army service now. US Army One of the Army's initial prototype DE M-SHORAD vehicles. US Army 'There are also low-collateral interceptors, which I was pretty excited about in that [in] my previous capacity,' Gainey continued. 'And these are interceptors that would have some sort of onboard net capturing system, or streamers, or whatever, to be able to take down some of your smaller UAS. Again, part of the layer, not the sole system, to help you be able to get after several different [threat] systems.' Limitations with drones that fire nets or streamers have emerged, as well. Gainey also highlighted ongoing work to develop and field high power microwave directed energy weapons for counter-drone use, as well as 'soft kill' options, such as electronic warfare jamming. A rendering of a Stryker armed with a high-power microwave directed energy weapon. GDLS The Army is also known to be fielding or at least exploring a variety of other counter-drone capabilities, including containerized systems that fire 70mm laser-guided rockets and gun-armed 'robot dogs' and other uncrewed ground platforms. The service also recently demonstrated the ability of its AH-64 Apaches to engage uncrewed aerial threats with radar-guided AGM-114L Hellfire missiles. . @USArmy Soldiers engage an unmanned aerial system (UAS) from an AH-64 with upgraded Hellfire missile during Red Sands training exercise in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. @usarmycentral pic.twitter.com/HG9ChuWxt6&mdash; U.S. Central Command (@CENTCOM) September 30, 2024 Loitering counter-drone interceptors are increasingly entering the picture, as well. Defense contractor Anduril just announced earlier this month that it had received major new U.S. miltiary contracts to ramp up deliveries of its jet-powered Roadrunner-M, which can also be reused if it doesn't execute an intercept. Regardless, 'you have to have a system of systems approach, in layers, where you have the ability to not only have RF [radiofrequency electronic warfare jamming], but also sensor/detectors, and also a complement of some type of kinetic effector, to give you the ability [to respond] across a range of threats,' Lt. Gen. Gainey stressed. 'Obviously, adversaries are looking for opportunities to outpace what we're producing. So if you employ capability in a layered approach, [it] is where you see the best opportunities for success.' It's worth noting that Gainey's comments here came as other U.S. military officials at Falcon Peak 2025 stressed that they are not interested, at least for now, in using kinetic effectors, such as surface-to-air interceptors or gun-based systems, or directed energy weapons to defend domestic facilities and assets against uncrewed aerial systems. This is despite a steady stream of glaringly concerning drone incidents over and around U.S. military bases, training ranges, and warships offshore, along with critical civilian infrastructure. Often confusing authorities and policies for deploying and employing anti-drone capabilities within the U.S. homeland, as well as concerns about collateral damage, have a significant impact on the current domestic counter-drone landscape. You can read more about these issues and their broader implications in other recent War Zone reporting from Falcon Peak 2025 here. As The War Zone has highlighted many times in the past, the U.S. military continues to very much be playing catch-up to drone threats, which are not new and continue to rapidly evolve, even when it comes to protecting forces deployed down-range. The ongoing war in Ukraine, where various tiers of drones are employed on a daily basis on both sides, together with crises in and around the Red Sea and elsewhere in the Middle, have provided significant new emphasis for the already urgent need for more defensive capabilities. In the meantime, Coyote interceptors do continue to prove their worth overseas as part of a counter-drone arsenal the Army is still working to expand capabilities.

Lasers, Microwaves, Missiles, Guns Not On The Table For Domestic ...	The U.S. military isn't currently interested in fielding kinetic and directed energy capabilities, such as laser and high-power microwave weapons, surface-to-air interceptors, and gun systems, for defending domestic bases and other critical infrastructure from rapidly growing and evolving drone threats. Instead, the focus is on electronic warfare and cyber warfare, and other 'soft-kill' options, at least for the time being. Still often confusing legal and regulatory hurdles that limit how and when counter-drone systems of any kind can be employed within the homeland are key drivers behind the U.S. military's current plans. Concerns about risks of collateral damage resulting from the use of anti-drone capabilities factor in heavily, too. This all, in turn, raises questions about the potential for serious gaps in the currently allowable but still largely non-existent domestic drone defense ecosystem. U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) Deputy Test Director Jason Mayes spoke yesterday about these plans and related issues with a small group of reporters including from The War Zone at Falcon Peak 2025, a counter-drone experiment at Peterson Space Force Base. NORTHCOM is headquartered at Peterson, as is the U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), and the two share the same commander. 'We are focused on [counter-drone] technologies that have potential, not saying they're completely approved yet, but potential for use in the homeland, specifically,' Mayes explained. 'So we're not bringing out stuff that's&#8230; like the kinetic kill [capabilities]&#8230; that you're seeing over in CENTCOM [U.S. Central Command] and AFRICOM [U.S. Africa Command].' A system designed to detect drones via the radiofrequency signals they put out and hijack the control link between them and their operators on display at Falcon Peak 2025. Howard Altman Various tiers of drones present ever-growing threats on and off traditional battlefields. This is a reality that is not at all new at this point, but that has finally been rammed into the mainstream discourse thanks in large part to the ongoing war in Ukraine, as well as various crises in and around the Middle East. A series of still-unexplained drone incursions over Langley Air Force Base in Virginia over the course of several weeks in December 2023, which The War Zone was first to report on, is a particularly prime example of the potential dangers all of this poses to the U.S. homeland. We have reported for years now on other glaringly concerning incidents in and around the United States impacting military bases, training ranges, and warships offshore, as well as critical civilian infrastructure. Several companies brought counter-drone systems to demonstrate at Falcon Peak 2025, many of which center on defeating or at least disrupting targets via jamming GPS and other RF signals. There are also others that utilize more novel capabilities, including systems designed to hijack line-of-sight control links between a drone and its operator and drones that can fire nets or stringy streamers at other uncrewed aerial systems in flight. While potentially deployable within the current regulatory framework, these systems have very clear limitations. This counter-drone system from Leidos demonstrated at Falcon Peak 2025 includes a drone that fires stringy streamers at other uncrewed aerial systems. Howard Altman It is useful here to step back and think about the current counter-drone ecosystem from the perspective of tiered capabilities (and associated rules of engagement) starting at the very lowest end with systems intended to increase situational awareness, typically through passive signal detection and tracking. This is where a drone is detected and tracked via its own electronic emissions. The next step up is active sensors, generally radars, that can track the drone regardless of it emitting radio frequency energy or not. Both passive and active systems are often paired with electro-optical and infrared cameras to help with positively identifying targets. Moving further up the capability ladder, there are non-kinetic 'soft kill' defense options like electronic warfare, followed by directed energy weapons like lasers and high-power microwaves, and finally more traditional kinetic effectors like drone-hunting drones, anti-aircraft guns, and surface-to-air missiles. There are some outlier systems like drones that might fire things like nets, streamers or goo, or use electronic pulses to disable a drone, which fall somewhere near the same category directed energy. 'There are kinetic options&#8230;. They're just not here,' NORTHCOM's Mayes said. 'Many of them [existing counter-drone systems] do have the ability to integrate with a kinetic type [of capability]. &#8230;. But again, it's not something we were super interested in that regard.' He highlighted the 20mm Vulcan cannon-armed Centurion C-RAM (Counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar) and the Coyote counter-drone interceptor as being among such capabilities in U.S. military service now. 'They're not appropriate for the homeland,' Mayes added. When it comes to discussions about domestic drone defense within the borders of the United States, the point here about appropriateness is perhaps more important than any discussions about specific capabilities. A multi-faceted layered defensive architecture featuring various components from the aforementioned tiers would be the best for providing a broad scope of coverage against uncrewed aerial threats. 'So that's the obstacle, right? The policies and the legalities of being able to use the systems, absolutely,' Mayes said. 'Net capture would be a fantastic asset on an installation,' he continued, using that capability as one example. 'But it's semi-autonomous, flying over top of people, capturing drones&#8230; and then you get into the engagement authorities for all that stuff when you talk 130i and all that, right?' '130(i)' here refers to that subsection of Title 10 of the U.S. Code (10 USC 130i), which covers current authorities for the 'protection of certain facilities and assets from unmanned aircraft.' Under 130i, the U.S. military has the authority to take 'action' to defend against drones including with measures to 'disrupt control of the unmanned aircraft system or unmanned aircraft, without prior consent, including by disabling the unmanned aircraft system or unmanned aircraft by intercepting, interfering, or causing interference with wire, oral, electronic, or radio communications used to control the unmanned aircraft system or unmanned aircraft' and the 'use reasonable force to disable, damage, or destroy the unmanned aircraft system or unmanned aircraft.' A full list of the kinds of 'action' authorized under 10 USC 130i. Cornell Law School At the same time, the statute as it currently exists stipulates that 'the Secretary of Defense shall coordinate with the Secretary of Transportation and the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] before issuing any guidance or otherwise implementing this section if such guidance or implementation might affect aviation safety, civilian aviation and aerospace operations, aircraft airworthiness, or the use of airspace.' There are notable caveats about the 'covered facility or asset[s]' the law applies to, as well. A specific list provided in the statute is focused largely on top-tier national security sites and assets, including those related to nuclear deterrence, protecting the President and Vice President, the nation's air and missile defense networks, and space launch activities. The U.S. military does also reserve its inherent right to act outside of this authority in self-defense. 'Covered facility or asset' as defined by 10 USC 130i Cornell Law School Despite efforts in recent years to expand domestic counter-drone authorities across the U.S. government, 10 USC 130i, as well as other legal and regulatory frameworks, continue to impose significant limitations on how and when assets can be deployed and employed. U.S. Air Force Officials at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina specifically cited 10 USC 130i as impacting their decision to explore installing entirely passive physical counter-drone defenses. Authorities at Langley Air Force Base are also looking into improving their defenses against uncrewed aerial systems by adding nets to open-ended sunshade-type shelters. The War Zone was first to report on both of these developments. A graphic offering general details about the sunshade-type shelters at Langley that could now be in line to receive anti-drone nets. USAF NORTHCOM's Mayes highlighted how these issues are impacting plans to expand the use of even electronic warfare capabilities. 'Given the impact of GPS denial, just across infrastructure and all that stuff, it is a very, very difficult capability to get permissions to utilize' even for limited and heavily structured test events like Falcon Peak 2025, Mayes explained. Planners for the experiment were presented with the need to provide 30 to 45 days of lead time to unspecified agencies to get the required approval. 'Once we started talking to them and telling them, you know, if this were a real-world scenario where we are actively trying to get capability into an installation in a prolonged incident of some sort, right, we don't have 30-45 days,' Mayes said. 'And we said, this is a data point that we're actually trying to collect in the process &#8230; how quick can we move this through, so that an installation commander that has concerns over what's happening has the ability to flip the switch on some of these GPS denial capabilities to protect his assets, right?' 'I think, in real-time, we would probably be able to do it very quickly,' he added, but also highlighted the importance of increased coordination with agencies outside of the Department of Defense on counter-drone issues, which NORTHCOM says it is working on. The drone incursions over Langley last December, especially, have highlighted the importance of being able to rapidly respond to such incidents. There are other past incidents that provide evidence of difficulties in quickly reacting to potentially malicious domestic drone activity. For instance, we know authorities were still in the process of approving the deployment of a domain awareness-type counter-drone system days after multiple still-unexplained drone incursions over the Palo Verde nuclear power plant in Arizona in 2019. The FAA also only imposed temporary flight restrictions around Air Force Plant 42, a top hub for advanced aerospace development work including on the B-21 Raider stealth bomber, in August of this year after months of drone incursions there. These are events that The War Zone again was first to report on. Mayes also stressed the need for greater clarity on existing authorities to make sure U.S. commanders know what options are available to them and are willing to employ them without fear of inadvertent repercussions. 'There's a lot of policy, and there's some, you know, I wouldn't call them gaps, per se, but there's some areas where you've got one policy saying one [thing], another policy saying another, and the parts where they cross over get a little blurry.. and just confusing,' Mayes said, noting that this applies to internal U.S. military policies, as well. 'So I think we need to solidify all that.' A trailer-mounted Sentry Tower domain awareness system from Anduril at Falcon Peak 2025. Howard Altman 'I think we need to clarify it [the policies] a little bit and establish a better understanding of that at the installation commanders level, who's responsible for this, right, so that they feel, you know, a little more comfortable in telling their troop[s], yes, we need to pull that [drone] down,' he added. Even if counter-drone policies are clarified and solidified, and authorities get expanded, there are still other concerns at play, especially when it comes to collateral damage. Shooting something down with a gun-based system or a surface-to-air missile carries inherent dangers of projectiles or interceptors, or debris from them, falling onto innocent bystanders below. The aforementioned Centurion C-RAM fires specialized self-destructing ammunition to reduce these risks. The drone, or what is left of it, which could include undetonated explosive warheads or other potentially hazardous payloads, would also fall to Earth in an uncontrolled manner after any such engagement. Maybe even more importantly is that these weapons do fail and they are packed with high explosives and traveling at high speed, which could cause very unpredictable harm to people and property in a large potential impact area. Then there is the idea that you have to know exactly what you are shooting at, and that can be harder than it sounds when dealing with strange objects in the sky, especially in populated areas where civilian air traffic is dense. Making the call to shoot down an object over the U.S. is an incredibly complex task that never actually occurred until recently. The U.S. military's decision to shoot down a Chinese spy balloon in 2023 only after it had passed out over the Atlantic, as well as the downing of three other still-unidentified objects that year in U.S. and Canadian airspace over water or very sparsely populated areas on land, underscores these risk assessment considerations. The War Zone highlighted these issues at the time. It is worth noting here that the U.S. military does have traditional gun-based air defense and surface-to-air missile systems arrayed around Washington, D.C., as well as various counter-drone systems. Details about the rules surrounding their employment are limited, but might help provide something of a model for deploying and employing expanded domestic anti-drone defenses. The U.S. military has also at least explored the idea in recent years of re-establishing a network of traditional surface-to-air missile sites to defend the homeland from various air and missile threats, which would have had to have touched on many of the same kinds of policy questions. At the same time, even lower tiers of counter-drone weapons, such as lasers and high-power microwave systems, can create dangerous or otherwise serious collateral effects. 'I think that we could get to a point where we have approval for that here in the homeland,' Mayes said of laser directed energy weapons for counter-drone use. 'The biggest thing right now is the impact of the laser when it moves beyond its target. You know, how far is it going? What's that going to do? How long does the laser need to remain on target before it begins to inflict damage and so on, right?' Mayes raised questions about whether the laser beam could impact aircraft or even satellites passing by, as well as things on the ground like 'hikers up on a hill.' The video below shows a test of a U.S. Navy shipboard laser directed energy weapon capable of being employed against drones. 'You have issues sometimes, when it comes to [high-power] microwaves, that, you know, emitting those out into an area, especially a populated area, it could become a problem, even if it's physically okay for the population,' he added. Omnidirectional electronic warfare jamming, whether of GPS or other RF signals, presents its own issues. It has the potential to disrupt nearby communications and RF-based instrumentation, including ones that drone defenders themselves might be utilizing to try to coordinate and do their job. Civilian frequencies could also be impacted, causing unwanted disruptions. Counter-drone jamming 'guns' that offer highly directional fields of fire have proven popular in part because of this reality, although their efficacy is spotty. A US Marine wields a counter-drone jamming 'gun' during training. USMC All of this in turn prompts questions about the potential for gaping capability and capacity gaps in the kinds of drone defense architecture the U.S. military is looking at currently. Even under the best circumstances, essentially relying on electronic warfare alone as the means of actually defeating or disrupting potentially hostile drones presents clear limitations. GPS guidance is already passive, presenting RF detection and engagement challenges, and further advances in autonomy, which are steadily proliferating, could further limit the utility of certain electronic warfare capabilities. Even today, commercial drones can be programmed to fly a certain route to a precise set of coordinates without anyone controlling them and they can remain aloft even when GPS is disrupted. This makes detecting and countering them with electronic warfare tactics very problematic if not impossible in certain scenarios. Looking for novel low-collateral options, such as the net or streamer-launching drones, to avoid using more traditional kinetic effectors or directed energy weapons is already proving challenging. Mayes said that low-collateral drone-on-drone capabilities currently seem best suited to tackling what he described as 'the careless and clueless,' or targets that, for whatever reason, keep a steady and relatively slow flight profile. 'Anytime that you are flying anything that's potentially chasing something else, if the other thing is faster or more agile, you're not going to catch it, right?' NORTHCOM's Mayes said today. 'Once you start getting into some of the faster [uncrewed aerial systems] like your FPV drones, your first-person view drones, these racing ones that are [capable of getting up to] 150-200 miles an hour, or drones that have been outfitted to be very agile, just the systems themselves are not able to keep up with that.' 'The demo that we did&#8230; [at Falcon Peak 2025] was more of a what we call defense mode, so kind of a point-point solution, like protection of a specific area or defending an area defending a point so the defense, defense mode allows the drone hunter to position itself much like a hockey goalie, soccer goalie, and keep a target from achieving its final destination,' Spencer Proust, Executive Vice President of Solution Engineering at Fortem Technologies, told The War Zone in response to related questions about the performance of the company's net-launching DroneHunter uncrewed aerial system. Attack mode would be much more like a dog fight, where it will chase its target, shoot it down, but when I say shoot it down, it actually has this particular system has two net guns on the front of it,' Proust added. 'It is not designed to chase down FPV drones, but that's why we have the [intercept-focused] defense mode.' Fortem does also say right on its website that DroneHunter is more of an 'effective back up layer to any antiaircraft missile defense systems' when it comes to faster and/or higher-flying threats. It's also worth noting that drone-on-drone combat has become commonplace in the conflict in Ukraine and there are claims that new defensive countermeasures are already emerging.

At the same time, these issues are not new, nor are the threats, and the U.S. government-wide lag in addressing them only continues to be more pronounced. Underscoring this is the fact that Falcon Peak 2025 is in no way the first such demonstration of potential capabilities. They have been going on for many years, often featuring very similar systems, with action even for the U.S. military's deployed forces only really ramping up once drones were raining down on allied fighters in Iraq during the battle of Mosul. You can read more about this glaring oversight here and here. In the meantime, drone threats continue to proliferate globally among state and non-state actors, including organized criminal groups. The barrier to entry to acquiring and employing armed drones, especially weaponized commercial types, is and has been low. To reiterate, these threats are real now and already exist in forms that could relatively easily overcome the limited array of drone defenses the U.S. military is currently looking at deploying domestically, especially if employed in large groups to say nothing of truly networked swarms. As already mentioned, the world also now looks to be on the verge of major new technological milestones in the lower-end uncrewed aerial system space, particularly when it comes to more autonomous targeting, driven heavily by advances in artificial intelligence, as you can read more about in this War Zone feature. Some of the responsibility for addressing these issues certainly falls to Congress, action from which would be required to alter things like 10 USC 130i or to establish new counter-drone legal frameworks. Legislators are clearly aware of this and a number of relevant legislative proposals have been put forward just in the past few months. The work NORTHCOM is doing through Falcon Peak 2025 is clearly meant to reflect a new push to address now long-standing demand for counter-drone defenses within the homeland. However, the event has also underscored significant barriers that remain in fielding these critical capabilities domestically, to that point that lasers, high-power microwaves, and other kinetic effectors are not even on the table, at least for the time being.

Final Conclusions On Bizarre Crash Of ‘Zombie’ F-35B That Flew Wi...	The USMC has released its final conclusions regarding its investigation into the bizarre loss of an F-35B that crashed in South Carolina on September 17th of last year. The Marines say that the mishap was caused primarily by pilot error, stating that 'the pilot incorrectly diagnosed an out-of-controlled flight emergency and ejected from a flyable aircraft, albeit during a heavy rainstorm compounded with aircraft electrical and display malfunctions.' The jet went on to continue flying without a pilot for over 60 miles before slamming into a field. Thankfully, nobody was injured as a result of the incident. You can read our last in a number of reports on the F-35B's 'ghost ship'-like mishap here. The release from the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing summarizes the circumstances of the crash as they are now known: 'On the afternoon of Sept. 17, 2023, a U.S. Marine Corps F-35B Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, assigned to Marine Fighter Attack Training Squadron (VMFAT) 501, 2nd MAW, crashed in South Carolina. The pilot safely ejected from the aircraft while attempting to execute a climbout during a missed approach in instrument meteorological conditions and heavy precipitation near Joint Base Charleston, South Carolina. The aircraft continued to fly unmanned for 11 minutes and 21 seconds before impacting in a rural area approximately 64 nautical miles northeast of the airfield in Williamsburg County, South Carolina. &#8230; The investigation concluded the pilot’s decision to eject was ultimately inappropriate because commanded-flight inputs were in progress at the time of ejection, standby flight instrumentation was providing accurate data, and the aircraft’s backup radio was, at least partially, functional. Furthermore, the aircraft continued to fly for an extended period after ejection.' F-35B in STOVL configuration. (USAF) The release goes on to describe other issues that contributed to the loss of the F-35B, including a cascade of systems failures throughout the jet: 'Contributing factors to the mishap included an electrical event during flight, which induced failures of both primary radios, the transponder, the tactical air navigation system, and the instrument landing system; and the probability that the helmet-mounted display and panoramic cockpit display were not operational for at least three distinct periods. This caused the pilot to become disoriented in challenging instrument and meteorological conditions. This electrical malfunction was not related to any maintenance activities. All preventative, scheduled, and unscheduled maintenance conducted on the aircraft was correct and in keeping with established standards. The pilot was qualified and current to conduct the scheduled flight. The flight was scheduled, planned, briefed, and conducted properly, professionally, and in accordance with applicable orders and directives. The forecasted and observed weather at the time of the mishap supported the decision to land back at Joint Base Charleston. The investigation concludes the mishap aircraft’s extended unmanned flight was due to stability provided by the F-35’s advanced automatic flight-control systems. The loss of positive radar contact with the mishap aircraft resulted from a failed transponder caused by the electrical malfunction and the aircraft’s eventual descent below the air-traffic control radar horizon. The loss of positive contact could also be partially attributed to the F-35B’s low-observable technology.' To go along with the ATC audio put together by Aeroscout, here's the full radio traffic from Charleston County EMS/Fire for the #F35 pilot ejection beginning from the initial dispatch until they cleared the scene.

Engine fan, landing gear, and other debris found at the area where the F-35B impacted the ground.

You can check out the initial detailed report on the crash published earlier this year here. So there you have it, finally we get the USMC's conclusions to what was a the time a very strange mishap that thankfully ended up with just the loss of an aircraft, albeit a prized and very expensive one.

Two New Versions Of China’s J-15 Carrier Fighter Now Appear To Be...	The Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy, or PLAN has for the first time conducted dual-carrier operations in the South China Sea. The drills, involving the country’s first two in-service carriers, the Liaoning and Shandong, as well as at least 11 other vessels, also showcased the PLAN’s fast-growing air wing. This revealed that both the upgraded J-15B single-seat multirole fighter and probably also the J-15D two-seat electronic warfare jet are likely now in operational service. Between them, these new versions of the J-15 Flanker carrier-based fighter point to the rapid progress made by the PLAN in developing more advanced aircraft that operate from its expanding aircraft carrier fleet. 等了近5年的双航母编队 pic.twitter.com/6ph4cWyZbU&mdash; 逆袭 (@horobeyo) October 31, 2024 Photos and a video of the dual-carrier maneuvers were recently released by Chinese state media, although it’s unclear exactly when they date from. While clearly engineered for public consumption — including a flyby conducted by a dozen J-15s overhead the flotilla — the photo opportunity also points to how the PLAN is developing its wider blue-water capabilities, including the vessels required to support carriers on long, out-of-area deployments. At the same time, the similarity between this photo exercise (PHOTEX) and the kinds staged by the U.S. Navy — including in the Indo-Pacific region — is remarkable. The dramatic overhead formation of J-15 fighters — something that is also familiar from U.S. Navy PHOTEXes involving carriers — includes a group of 12 jets, also seen separated into six-ship flights. Meanwhile, another 18 J-15s were visible on the deck of the Shandong at the time of the flyby, with at least two more spotted on the Liaoning. - J-15B has light grey radome, are the CATOBAR compatible, 4.5th gen (new weapons, avionics AESA etc) variant, marked red- J-15/A has dark grey radome, STOBAR production/old version, 4th gen, marked greenIn flight I see 9 J-15B, 2 J-15A, but happy for other opinions. pic.twitter.com/4Hgl43P9bq&mdash; Rick Joe (@RickJoe_PLA) October 31, 2024 The fighters include both the original J-15 versions, which are equipped for short takeoff but assisted recovery (STOBAR) operations, and the more modern J-15B, which can also conduct catapult takeoff but assisted recovery (CATOBAR) operations. Bearing in mind the J-15B wasn’t known to be in operational service, the number of these particular versions involved (at least 15) makes it all the more notable. What do you think about this J-15-count? I see 16 regular J-15, 13 J-15B and maybe 2 J-15D! pic.twitter.com/g7KFRhXiue&mdash; @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) October 31, 2024 The J-15B is significantly more capable than the earlier J-15 and J-15A. Its CATOBAR features were first tested on the J-15T prototype, which added a strengthened nose landing gear with an accompanying catapult launch bar. The series-production J-15B also has a new active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar (under a darker-colored radome, with no pitot tube) and a more modern cockpit. While most J-15Bs still retain the tried and tested AL-31F engines, this version has also been tested with domestically produced WS-10 turbofans. This could be another major surprise The PLAN Naval Aviation converted at least one J-15 to WS-10B engines replacing the standard Russian AL-31F, so after only a few prototypes tested it in the early phase, this is eventually a hint that the WS-10 is ready for the J-15 too. pic.twitter.com/sTwdVnQU2k&mdash; @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) November 23, 2022 Less obvious, however, are the two J-15D electronic warfare jets, broadly similar to the U.S. Navy’s EA-18G Growler, but likely also possessing a secondary strike mission. These are seen parked immediately alongside the island on the Shandong. While they appear to be distinguished by their tandem two-seat cockpits and humped forward fuselages, we cannot entirely rule out the possibility that these are single-seaters. Reports suggest that the prototype J-15D first flew in late 2016. Like the land-based J-16D, this variant is characterized by large wingtip electronic warfare pods and it has the standard infrared search and track (IRST) sensor and cannon removed. Additional conformal and blade antennas are located around the airframe and further EW pods can be carried under the wings and below the fuselage.

Instead, the PLAN’s first two carriers use a ‘ski-jump’ takeoff ramp to launch fixed-wing aircraft.

This ships can be identified are three Type 055 Renhai class destroyers, four Type 052D Luyang III class destroyers, one Type 054A Jiangkai II class frigate, and two Type 901 Fuyu class fast combat support ships. Twelve J-15s over the PLAN dual-carrier group. Chinese Internet via X Two support vessels were at the rear of the flotilla. Chinese Internet via X Typically, the Liaoning and Shandong go to sea with air wings made up of up to a maximum of 24 J-15 fighters. These are generally supported by around two Z-18F anti-submarine warfare helicopters, two Z-18JA airborne early warning helicopters, and a pair of smaller Z-9 helicopters for plane-guard and general utility duties. It should be noted that the Liaoning and Shandong have been at sea simultaneously before but have never been seen in such close proximity. There were also reports last month that the PLAN put three aircraft carriers to sea at the same time, although one of these, the Fujian, is not yet operational, while the Liaoning and Shandong were operating a significant distance apart: in the Philippine Sea and off Hainan Island, respectively. The aircraft carrier Liaoning at the front of the flotilla. In this photo, the censor has removed the pennant number from the front end of the flight deck. Chinese Internet via X The fact that these recent maneuvers were documented in the highly strategic South China Sea is also no coincidence. Beijing claims almost all of these waters as its own, resulting in numerous disputes and standoffs with other nations in this region, and these kinds of naval drills are very much in keeping with China’s military signaling here. Looking at the development of the carrier-based Flanker versions in more detail, the J-15 is the Chinese equivalent of the Soviet-designed Su-33 Flanker, a prototype of which China secured from Ukraine to assist in reverse engineering it. Unlike the Su-33, the J-15 has a multirole capability, since it incorporates avionics from the land-based J-11B fighter, although it retains the Russian-made AL-31F turbofans, unlike other Chinese Flanker versions now in production. The J-15A designation is sometimes applied to a slightly improved later-production version, with some additional precision-guided weapons options. As for the new J-15B, as well as its enhanced capabilities, this provides the PLAN with its first experience of CATOBAR operations, which will be fundamental to getting the most out of its future carriers, starting with the Fujian, which is equipped with an electromagnetic aircraft launch system (EMALS), something that remains a relatively new and complex technology. In the meantime, the J-15B and J-15D can clearly also be operated in STOBAR mode, which provides the air wings of the Liaoning and Shandong with a more capable fighter compared to the original J-15. It should be noted that the PLAN is also exploring other carrier-based Flanker versions, to further expand the mission spectrum and capabilities of its carrier air wings. These include the two-seat J-15S, which some analysts assume will be initially used as a trainer, but which will likely also inform the development of a two-seat carrier-based multirole strike and electronic warfare platform, which may be designated J-17. A multirole-capable two-seater would also be relevant for other more complex missions, including long-range air defense or even working as a command and control platform for combat drones. Taken from a TV news report, this image shows an operational J-15S in its PLAN colors, parked alongside a single-seat J-15. Chinese Internet via X Ultimately, however, the CATOBAR-capable J-15 and other new Chinese carrier-based Flanker versions will likely be a stepping-stone toward the more advanced capabilities that will be offered by the PLAN’s next carrier fighter, the stealthy J-35, developed from the land-based FC-31. While the J-35 was designed from the ground up for CATOBAR operations, aboard the Fujian and subsequent carriers, there are also signs that it, like the J-15B and J-15D, might also eventually embark on the Liaoning and Shandong. A close-up view of mockups of the J-35 and a J-15 variant aboard the Liaoning earlier this year. Chinese Internet via X As we have discussed before, having the J-35 join the air wing of the Liaoning and Shandong would be a significant boost. In addition to its low-observable characteristics, it’s assumed that the production aircraft will feature an advanced AESA radar among a host of modern sensors and very capable weaponry. The downside, as with putting the J-15B aboard the Liaoning and Shandong is that all these aircraft would have to launch off the bow ramp, limiting their payloads. However, as we’ve pointed out in the past, the J-35, which is intended to carry more limited stores internally, may be less dramatically affected than other types. A J-35 carrier-based stealth fighter prototype. Chinese Internet via X The navalized J-35 — this time not a mockup. Chinese internet Perhaps most importantly, integrating the CATOBAR-capable J-15B and J-15D and perhaps also the J-35B into the air wings of China’s first two carriers will provide very valuable experience for pilots, maintainers, and the wider PLAN. After all, the PLAN’s carrier aviation arm is still very much in its infancy, but it has bold ambitions. As well as the Fujian, which is now under test, and the J-35, the PLAN is looking forward to introducing the KJ-600 carrier-based radar plane, which will play a role analogous to the E-2 Hawkeye as a critical force-multiplier. The size and weight of the KJ-600 will preclude it from going to sea aboard the Liaoning and Shandong. Carrier-based drones, including unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs), are also a growing area of interest for the PLAN and it’s now widely expected that the Fujian, at least, will eventually embark a low-observable UCAV that will offer strike, surveillance, and targeting capabilities. An artist’s concept of a future Chinese aircraft carrier. Chinese internet via @HenriKenhmann After the Fujian, China is also widely expected to introduce more fully locally designed carriers, perhaps even with nuclear propulsion rather than the conventional powerplants used in its first three flattops. In the meantime, the recent photo opportunity showing the PLAN’s dual-carrier operations and the expanding capabilities of its air wing, provide yet another indication of China’s expanding naval presence, especially in terms of its steadily growing carrier force.

Oldest Arleigh Burke Destroyers Get Reprieve, Service Extended In...	The U.S. Navy plans to keep 12 more of its Flight I Arleigh Burke class destroyers in service beyond their originally 35-year expected service life. Some of the ships, which could also be in line for important upgrades to their defensive and offensive capabilities, are now set to keep sailing into the 2030s. The life extension decision is part of an ambitious Navy-wide strategy rolled out earlier this year that includes a major focus on increasing the readiness of warships and other key assets. The Navy announced the new decision regarding the Flight I Arleigh Burkes, which Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro approved, in a press release today. At present, the service has 73 Arleigh Burke destroyers in service, in total. This includes 21 Flight I ships, as well as a mixture of Flight II, IIA, and III types with successive improvements. The USS John Paul Jones, one of the Navy's Flight I Arleigh Burke class destroyers. USN The Navy has been eyeing Arleigh Burke service life extensions since at least 2018. In March 2023, it announced that the USS Arleigh Burke would remain in service into 2031. Last August, the service disclosed additional plans to stretch out the service life of four more Flight I Burkes, the USS Ramage, USS Benfold, USS Mitscher, and USS Milius to between 2034 and 2036. The Navy did not name the ships included in the latest life extension plans. 'The decision, based upon a hull-by-hull evaluation of ship material condition, combat capability, technical feasibility and lifecycle maintenance requirements, will result in an additional 48 ship-years of cumulative ship service life in the 2028 to 2035 timeframe,' the Navy said today in regard to the new life extension announcement. 'The Navy has proposed DDG service life extension funding in the FY26 budget request, and will update the shipbuilding plan accordingly.' 'At the Secretary’s request, the Navy conducted a thorough evaluation of each DDG-51 Flight I ship (DDG 51-71) over the past ten months, and determined the 12 destroyers could and should remain operational beyond their expected service life,' the service's release adds. 'The final determination of each ship’s service life is based on maximizing the service life of each ship before it required another extensive and costly docking availability.' The decision by the Navy to extend the service life of more Flight I Burkes is not necessarily surprising. Arleigh Burke class destroyers currently make up the plurality of the service's surface warfare fleets. The Flight I Burkes, which entered service in the 1990s, are still very capable ships. Each one notably has 90 strike-length Mk 41 Vertical Launch System cells that can be loaded with a variety of missiles, including Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles and SM-2 surface-to-air missiles. Flight I Burkes have already received multiple upgrades over the years and are now in line to receive new updates to their defensive capabilities in the form of new launchers for RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM). This is part of a broader plan to replace the Phalanx Close-In Weapon Systems (CIWS) on all Arleigh Burke class destroyers with different kinds of RAM launchers depending on subvariant, as you can read more about here. At least eight Arleigh Burkes already have SeaRAM systems, which they received along with additional electronic warfare capabilities, as part of what is known as the ‘Rota’ configuration developed for destroyers in this class forward based at Rota, Spain. In addition, the Navy is exploring the possibility of adding new stealthy Naval Strike Missile (NSM) anti-ship cruise missiles, which also have a secondary land-attack capability, to the Flight I Burkes' arsenal. The USS Fitzgerald has already been armed in this way and demonstrated this capability as a proof of concept that the service says will inform decisions going forward. The USS Fitzgerald fires a Naval Strike Missile (NSM) cruise missile during the 2024 Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise. USN Petty Officer 2nd Class Jordan Jennings The centrality of the Arleigh Burke class overall and the value of the Flight I ships specifically, especially their VLS cells, is only set to increase in the near term, especially with the impending retirement of the last of the Ticonderoga class cruisers. Each Ticonderoga has 122 Mk 41 VLS cells. Navy plans to decommission the four heavily in-demand Ohio class guided missile submarines, which can be armed with a maximum of 154 Tomahawks, before the end of the decade will only further diminish the service's overall missile launch capacity at a very inconvenient time. The importance of Arleigh Burkes has already been on full display in the past year or so in operations in and around the Red Sea and in the defense of Israel. The USS Arleigh Burke and USS Carney, another Flight I type, were among the U.S. ships that helped knock down Iranian missiles and drones heading toward Israeli targets in April. By that time, Carney had already been heavily engaged in the Red Sea against threats launched by Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen. The Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Carney sailing in the Red Sea fires a surface-to-air missile at Houthi threats on October 19, 2023. USN The Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Carney fires a surface-to-air missile at Houthi threats on October 19, 2023. USN 'Extending these highly-capable, well-maintained destroyers will further bolster our numbers as new construction warships join the Fleet,' Secretary of the Navy Del Toro said in a statement today. 'It also speaks to their enduring role in projecting power globally, and most recently in the Red Sea, their proven ability to defend themselves, as well as our allies, partners and friends from missile and drone attacks.' The mention here of 'new construction warships' is particularly significant given the major delays with the Constellation class frigate program, which you can read about in more detail here. The first of those frigates may now not enter service until 2029, nearly a decade after the award of the initial production contract. A true successor to the Arleigh Burke class, currently referred to as DDG(X), is still far off on the horizon, as well. As it stands now, the Navy is not expecting the construction of the first of these new warships to even start until 2032. A graphic from 2022 depicting a notional DDG(X) design and its features. USN On top of all of this, concerns about at best relatively flat defense budgets in the coming years have been increasingly sending shockwaves across the entire U.S. military and forcing serious rethinking of even top-priority modernization efforts. Future shipbuilding plans, which can be costly and require significant lead time under the best circumstances, could easily be impacted. There have been serious questions about overall U.S. shipyard capacity for new production naval vessels, as well as repair work, for years now. The Navy has been looking at ways to rectify these deficiencies, including through the use of foreign companies. An Office of Naval Intelligence briefing slide from circa 2023 comparing U.S. and Chinese shipbuilding capacity. USN USN 'Today’s budget constrained environment requires the Navy to make prioritized investments to keep more ready players on the field,' Navy Adm. Lisa Franchetti, Chief of Naval Operations, the service's top uniformed office, said in a statement today around the Flight I Burke life extension announcement. 'The Navy is actively pulling the right levers to maintain and grow its Battle Force Inventory to support the United States’s global interests in peace and to win decisively in conflict.' Franchetti rolled out a new 'navigation plan,' also known as Project 33, for her service earlier this year that prominently included a call to get to a place by 2027 where it would be possible to surge deploy 80 percent of all naval vessels and combat aircraft, and do so relatively quickly, if necessary. This would represent a huge increase over current readiness rates and it remains to be seen if the Navy will be able to get anywhere near that goal in the next three years. 'We are shooting for very high, very tough stretch goals here, and I know that, but the only way we’re going to get there [is] if you set those goals that high,' Franchetti said in September. 'That is what we need to do.' The decision now to keep more Flight I Arleigh Burkes in service through the 2028-2035 timeline will at least help the Navy keep its total warship inventory up as it tries to meet its broader and highly ambitious goals.

Cause Of Fire At UK’s Critical Nuclear Submarine Shipyard Still U...	A blaze has ripped through the BAE Systems’ nuclear submarine shipyard in Cumbria, England, a unique facility of major strategic importance where the U.K. Royal Navy’s Astute class nuclear-powered fast attack submarines and Dreadnought class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines are being built. While the cause of the fire is yet to be determined, it comes at a time of increasing concern about Russian-inspired sabotage activities across Europe. The 'significant' fire at the Devonshire Dock Hall (DDH) building, at BAE Systems’ complex in Barrow-in-Furness, in the northeast of England, started overnight. Three Astute class submarines under construction at BAE Systems’ Devonshire Dock Hall located in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, England. BAE Systems Footage posted to social media shows long flames reaching into the sky and smoke billowing above the DDH building, one of the largest of its kind in Europe. A woman living nearby, Donna Butler, 36, said: 'My son came and got me and said that the BAE alarms were going off, so we went. When I opened the front door, we just saw a lot of black smoke. It was a lot of black smoke, like really thick black smoke, and it was very loud.' At the time of the incident, around 200 people were working on the night shift.

Assume the former but check good for the latter. pic.twitter.com/YYk58r42rT&mdash; Mike (@Doranimated) October 30, 2024 A BAE Systems spokesperson said: 'The area around the Devonshire Dock Hall has been evacuated and everyone has been accounted for. Two colleagues were taken to hospital having suffered suspected smoke inhalation and have both since been released.' 'At this time there are no other casualties and everyone else has been evacuated from the Devonshire Dock Hall and are accounted for,' the police said. Although residents of the local area were told to stay indoors, the police said there was no radiation risk associated with the blaze. The police later said that residents should keep doors and windows closed, likely due to the risk of particles, especially from metals and other construction materials. At this stage, the cause of the fire is unclear, although different naval sources and investigators have so far sought to play down the possibility that it might have been started deliberately. A U.K. Ministry of Defense spokesperson said it was working closely with both BAE Systems and the emergency services and added: 'We would like to thank the emergency services for their swift response and wish those who have required hospital treatment a quick recovery.' The Cumbrian fire and rescue service also said an investigation into the cause of the fire was underway. In the meantime, BAE Systems confirmed that work is continuing as normal elsewhere at the facility. Reports suggest that, at the time of the incident, the nuclear-powered attack submarine (SSN) HMS Agincourt was in the DDH building, where it is being completed as the last of the seven-strong Astute class.

The completion of the boat is expected in 2026. Once the Astute class attack submarines are completed, the DDH building will be the center of production for the new Dreadnought class SSBNs. The Dreadnought class is scheduled to enter service starting in the early 2030s at a total estimated cost of around $43 billion. Armed with Trident submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), the Dreadnoughts will replace a similar number of Vanguard class SSBNs now in Royal Navy service.

BAE Systems The DDH building is also set to be critical to the SSN-AUKUS line of submarines, future SSNs that will be delivered to the U.K. Royal Navy and the Royal Australian Navy. The first of these is planned to be delivered to the United Kingdom by the late 2030s, with the initial example for Australia being handed over in the early 2040s. You can read more about what we know of this tripartite effort — which also involves the United States — here. Concept art of the submerged SSN-AUKUS. U.K. Ministry of Defense illustration As of today, non-essential staff working at the DDH building have been told to work from home on Wednesday and there is a report from the BBC that staff who did arrive at the site were confused as to which parts of the site were still accessible. The DDH building is 167 feet tall and has internal working dimensions of 850 feet by 190 feet, providing a total area of 270,000 square feet. Built in the first half of the 1980s, the building provides a fully protected working environment for nuclear submarine construction, without the need for slipways, and it also keeps sensitive construction activities hidden from intelligence-gathering satellites. Only last month, plans were submitted for the further development of the site, with a new facility to be built, to serve as a pre-paint outfitting facility. Profile view of BAE Systems Devonshire Dock Hall. SteveMi/Wikicommons At this early stage, there is nothing to point to the blaze having been started deliberately, but the current security situation in Europe should also be considered. There has been a recent spike in reports of sabotage at various military and defense-related installations across Europe. Some of these have been confirmed as being deliberate, while others have ultimately proven to be false alarms. In April, for example, one of Norway’s most strategic air bases had a critical communications cable severed, with local police confirming this was deliberate.
