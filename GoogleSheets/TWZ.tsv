Conventionally Armed ICBM Concept Highlighted By Unprecedented Ru...	It is now confirmed that the weapon Russia fired in an unprecedented attack on Ukraine yesterday was not an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). However, the missile in question, named Oreshnik, is technically derived from an ICBM. Its use highlights past discussions about the potential value of a conventionally armed ICBM, which some countries may be looking at fielding if they haven't already, and that would offer a unique extremely long-range strike capability below the nuclear threshold. Russian President Vladimir Putin disclosed the existence of Oreshnik and announced its use in the attack on the eastern Ukrainian city of Dnpiro in a televised address yesterday. The missile is based on the RS-26 Rubezh, according to the Pentagon, a secretive missile you can read more about in detail here. Readers can also find more about what is known about the attack and Oreshnik in The War Zone's prior reporting.

Short, Medium, and Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles (SRBM, MRBM, and IRBM) have ranges of 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) or less, between 620 and 1,860 miles (1,000 and 3,000 kilometers), and between 1,864 and 3,418 miles (3,000 to 5,500 kilometers), respectively. Within those categories, the exact configuration of the missile, including how many warheads it carries, conventional or nuclear, can vary significantly. The Oreshnik that Russia fired at Ukraine yesterday carried six individual warheads each with six submunitions, according to authorities in the latter country. Putin has said the weapon included unspecified 'non-nuclear hypersonic technology.' It remains unknown when the missile carried standard re-entry vehicles, maneuvering ones, or true hypersonic boost-glide vehicles. ICBMs and other larger ballistic missiles, and their payloads, typically reach substantial hypersonic speeds, generally defined as Mach 5 or above, in the course of their flight and especially while their payloads careen down to their targets. It's worth noting here that the RS-26 already represents an unusual case when it comes to categorization. Officially, Rubezh is an ICBM, but there has long been evidence that it is actually an IRBM. The RS-26 is itself understood to be a shortened derivative of the RS-24 Yars ICBM, which the U.S. government assesses to just be a variant of the preceding RS-12M Topol-M. There is already some debate also about where the Oreshnik lies on the range spectrum, with Putin calling it a medium-range weapon and American officials putting it in the IRBM category. A Russian road-mobile RS-24 Yars ICBM. Vitaly Kuzmin This all may have contributed in various ways to Ukraine's initial assessment that what Russian forces had fired was an ICBM. That being said, the concept at least of a conventionally armed ICBM is a real thing. Just last year, the U.S. military openly stated that it had assessed there to be 'possible interest in [the] development of a conventional ICBM' within China's People's Liberation Army (PLA). There have also been reports that Israel's Jericho 3, described as an ICBM, can be employed with a conventional payload. The earlier Jericho 1 short-range ballistic missile and Jericho 2 IRBM, both of which were reportedly retired in the 1990s, are also understood to have been able to carry conventional warheads, as well as nuclear ones. Israel does not publicly acknowledge the existence of its nuclear or longer-range ballistic missile arsenals. The Israeli Shavit-2 space launch rocket, seen being launched here, is reportedly tied to the country's Jericho series of ballistic missiles. Israel Ministry of Defense 'Israel is also reportedly developing the next generation of the Jericho, the Jericho 4, a three-stage missile, whose capabilities will include the possibility of carrying fragmentation warheads,' according to a report earlier this year from The Jerusalem Post. The story did not provide any further details about that missile, including a range categorization, but it points to the possibility of another Israeli long-range conventional ballistic missile capability in the works. The U.S. military has also explored similar capabilities in the past, including a possible conventionally-armed version of the Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missile, which has intercontinental range. A Trident II launch. USN The Ohio class nuclear ballistic missile submarine USS Rhode Island fires a Trident II during a routine test in 2019. USN After the Pentagon highlighted Chinese interest in a conventional ICBM in 2023, The War Zone explored the potential benefits of such a capability, writing: 'A likely goal of developing such a system for the PLA would be to have a weapon that puts strategic targets, such as air bases, ports, major command and control nodes, and seats of government, as well as symbolic ones, anywhere in the United States (or really anywhere in the world) at risk without having to escalate to the use of nuclear weapons. This could offer a powerful deterrent to non-nuclear strikes against the Chinese mainland.' 'In addition, the hope could be that if these conventional ICBMs ever had to be used the U.S. government, or any other potential nuclear-armed adversary, would be significantly less likely to retaliate with nuclear weapons.' Chinese DF-41 ICBMs, or mockups thereof, on parade. Global Times In a separate story exploring the possibility of Israel using Jerichos with conventional warheads against Iran, The War Zone further highlighted what a weapon of this kind might offer: 'Already, the Jericho missiles provide the fastest means of striking targets in Iran, and their ballistic trajectory and speed would likely render them immune to interception, especially given the very limited capabilities of Iran’s air defenses against ballistic missile threats. A subsonic cruise missile would be much easier to intercept and wouldn’t provide the option of hitting certain time-sensitive or hardened targets. And in contrast to long-range direct attacks by Israeli Air Force aircraft, no Israeli personnel would be put in harm’s way. ' 'A Jericho missile with a conventional payload would be a very capable weapon in its own right, for the above reasons and even a high-explosive warhead would be extremely destructive. According to CSIS, the Jericho 2 can carry a 3,300-pound high-explosive warhead, while the Jericho 3 has a payload capacity of between 2,200 and 2,900 pounds, although that is in a configuration that has to fly many thousands of miles, not one that has to hit a fraction of that distance. So a much larger payload could be possible if it was adapted for a regional strike profile.' 'The extreme speed that the missiles’ warheads would be traveling during their terminal attack makes them capable of targeting hardened or buried command centers and other key fortified sites to a degree the IAF isn’t capable of. This is a huge capability to consider. Israel does not have the ability to destroy Iranian nuclear facilities that are deeply buried, like the enrichment site in Fordow, via traditional aerial attack, without resorting to nuclear strikes. The United States is the only nation with a conventional air-to-ground capability that could potentially do this — the U.S. B-2 stealth bomber and its Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP). But, knowing this limitation, could Israel have created conventional penetrator warheads for its ballistic missiles that could potentially threaten these sites, at least being capable of disabling them for a period of time?' A conventional ICBM carrying multiple warheads, or even with a true multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) configuration, could offer even greater capability. A MIRVed missile with conventionally-armed re-entry vehicles with significant accuracy would allow a single missile to strike multiple impact points.

Wilson44691 via Wikimedia A payload bus from a decommissioned LGM-118A Peacekeeper ICBM now on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force with 10 mock re-entry vehicles. Wilson44691 via Wikimedia There are also clear strategic messaging benefits that would come along with a conventional ICBM capability. A successful attack with such a weapon would have the knock-on effect of very visibly demonstrating the ability to conduct a nuclear strike. Russia clearly had a desire to send signals to Ukraine, and more so to the United States and other countries supporting it, as well as demonstrate a practical capability, with its use of Oreshnik today. At the same time, while there are clear benefits to fielding a conventionally armed ICBM, they could also present worrying discrimination challenges for a defender, who would struggle to determine whether or not they were under nuclear threat. The speed at which an ICBM travels already limits the time available to assess the threat and respond in any way. All of this raises the possibility of a scenario in which an opponent, mistakenly believes they are under nuclear attack and responds in kind, which in turn could well prompt a rapidly escalating nuclear exchange. This is not an idle concern. The Pentagon has said it received advance warning of the Oreshnik attack directly from the Russians through established nuclear risk reduction channels. The notification occurred even though Russia's forces fired the missile across a relatively short distance (roughly 500 miles) at a target inside a non-nuclear state not covered by America's deterrent umbrella.

American officials have also openly criticized China's ambiguity around their deployment of longer-range ballistic missiles capable of carrying conventional or nuclear warheads. While it has turned out that the RS-26-based Oreshnik that Russia fired at Ukraine was not a conventionally-armed ICBM, it still highlights the very real interest in, if not more active development and even potential fielding of, a weapon of that kind globally.

Anti-Personnel Landmines Included In U.S. Aid Package To Ukraine ...	The Pentagon on Thursday said that Ukraine will be receiving anti-personnel landmines for the first time as part of the latest tranche of weapons for the embattled nation. The latest Presidential Drawdown Authority Package (PDA), valued at up to $275 million was announced Wednesday. It made no specific mention of landmines but included an unspecified amount of 155mm artillery shells. The Pentagon confirmed that the mines are part of the latest PDA. That points to Ukraine likely being given artillery-fired Area Denial-Artillery-Munitions (ADAMs), designed to scatter landmines ahead of, on top of, or behind enemy forces. Several other indicators point to ADAMs. Ukraine has already received 70,000 of the anti-armor variants of the mine-dispensing shells, has the howitzers needed to fire them which require no new training and nothing else in the package seems to be a match. It is still possible that there is another type of anti-personnel mine capability is being given to Ukraine that wasn't listed, but that seems unlikely based on the factors listed above and Ukraine's urgent battlefield needs. 155mm ADAM shells come in two flavors, the M692 and M731, which both contain 36 individual mines. The rounds also function in the same way, releasing the mines out of the rear end after reaching a set point in their flight. U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command Where the M692 and M731 differ is in the specific types of mines inside. The M692 contains M67s, while the M731 has M72. The wedge-shaped mines themselves are only different in the lifespans of their internal batteries – approximately 48 hours for the M67 and just around 4 hours for the M72. Otherwise, each M67 and M72 'has eight trip wires (four on the top and four on the bottom) that deploy after ground impact up to 12 meters from the mine,' according to Army Field Manual 20-32. '[The] trip wires are similar in appearance to very fine thread; they are olive-drab green in color and weighted at the free end. A tension of 405 grams applied to one trip wire is enough to create a break in the electrical circuit and cause the mine to detonate.' Each M67 and M72 contains golf ball-sized grenade-like explosive charge designed to 'kill enemy soldiers through the combined effects of blast and fragmentation,' per the Army manual. 'Shrapnel is propelled upward and outward from the mine and produces fatal casualties to a distance of 15 meters.' It's interesting to note that the casing of each M67 and M72 continues just under 0.01 grams of depleted uranium, which is added to the resin blend to help it cure faster and more reliably. U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command There is a possibility that other U.S. anti-personnel mine types could also be included in the most recent aid package for Ukraine, but not clearly identified. The Gator family of mines, which includes anti-personnel and anti-tank mines that can be dispersed using ground-based launchers and ones installed on helicopters, as well as air-dropped cluster munitions, remains in at least limited U.S. service. Older scatterable mines and methods of emplacing them like the Ground Emplaced Mine Scattering System (GEMSS) could still be held in storage. The U.S. military also reportedly maintains a stockpile of manually-emplaced anti-personnel mines in South Korea to be used if conflict were to resume on the Peninsula. Mines in general, and anti-personnel mines especially, are very controversial, particularly due to the threat they potentially pose to civilians long after a conflict is over. The limited battery life of the M67 and M72 mines, as well as Gator mines, is intended to reduce that threat but does not inert the explosives inside the mines, which can still present a serious hazard. The 1997 Ottowa Treaty bans the stockpiling and use of anti-personnel mines, but neither the United States nor Russia is a signatory. Ukraine is a party to the agreement. However, as of 2022, the official position of the U.S. government has been to 'align &#8230; policy and practice with key provisions of the Ottawa Convention for all activities outside the context of the Korean peninsula.' U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command The decision to provide ADAMs to Ukraine was made to counter Russia’s so-called 'meat assaults' - massive waves of personnel attacking positions. These attacks have been taking place for years, but especially so now in eastern Ukraine and Russia’s Kursk region. Though Russia has been slowly gaining ground this way, it has come at an incredibly high cost in terms of personnel and equipment losses. Ukraine needs weapons that can blunt these advances, said U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. 'What we've seen most recently is because the Russians have been so unsuccessful in the way that they have been fighting they've kind of changed their tactics a bit and they don't lead with their mechanized forces anymore,' Austin told reporters in Laos on Wednesday. 'They lead with dismounted forces who are able to close in and do things to kind of pave the way for mechanized forces.' Ukraine 'has a need for things that can help slow down that effort on the part of the Russians,' he posited. You can see the results of one of those 'meat waves' in the video below. While the Ukrainians are making their own landmines, Austin pointed out that those provided by the U.S. are what’s called 'non-persistent,' meaning that in theory, they make themselves inoperable in a certain amount of time, making them safer than what Ukrainians are making on their own. Austin insisted that Ukraine has promised to be 'responsible' with these weapons, which are only to be used on Ukrainian soil. He noted that the U.S. has already provided Remote Anti-Armor Mine System (RAAMs) projectiles, which are the anti-tank variant of these munitions. In addition to more than three million conventional 155mm artillery rounds, the U.S. has shipped more than 70,000 RAAMs to Ukraine, according to the Pentagon’s latest statistics. 'We've talked to them about how they would potentially employ these weapons and make sure that they're doing things responsibly - recording where they're putting their mines and making sure that they take advantage of the self-detonating qualities of these weapons.' The U.S., however, will have limited oversight in how Ukraine deploys the ADAMs, the Pentagon’s Deputy Press Secretary told reporters, including from The War Zone, Thursday afternoon. 'We're not tracking it in terms of where they place them, but certainly they have given us their assurances that they will be employed in a way that protects civilians,' Sabrina Singh explained. 'They have committed that they're going to use these mines in their own territory. And I should have added that they're not going to use them in populated areas.' Ukrainians have an interest in scattering these landmines as safely as possible, Singh noted. After the war, Ukraine 'is going to have to conduct a massive demining effort …to remove any unexploded ordinance, both from the landmines that Russia has put in place, and also to any anything else that has been used on the battlefield.' They are already doing this even under heavy Russian pressure along much of the battlefield, which includes large swaths of land littered with Russian mines. During Ukraine's failed 2023 counteroffensive, President Volodymyr Zelensk said 200,000 sq km (77,220 sq miles) of Ukrainian territory had been mined by Russian forces, slowing down advances. 'We've already seen them conduct this type of operation in some of the territory that they've recaptured,' Singh pointed out. 'The U.S. is committed to supporting them and to helping them with what they need in those key mining efforts.' As we recently noted, last month was the deadliest of the war for Russia, according to the U.K. Defense Intelligence Directorate. The average daily number of Russian troops killed and wounded was 1,354, it stated, citing Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff statistics. For the month, there were 41,900 casualties, eclipsing the previous record of 39,100 from May. November is off to an even bloodier start, with an average of 1,498 killed and wounded as of Nov. 12. All told, Russia has lost upwards of 700,000 killed and wounded, those statistics show. It’s worth noting that casualty numbers vary widely depending on the source and The War Zone cannot independently verify them.

That has placed an enormous burden on outmanned Ukrainian troops. With this in mind, the objective of providing ADAMs to Ukraine is to add to Russia’s mounting casualty count, reduce its forces ability to freely maneuver, and to slow what has been in some areas a grinding advance. All of this would assist in reducing the pressure the Russian military is apply at flashpoints along the front lines. With Donald Trump coming into office in two months, some form of negotiations are very likely approaching. Every inch Ukraine loses now it is unlikely to get back if the a perspective deal includes freezing the lines where they are, as many believe it would. Still, the move to supply anti-personnel mines to the Ukraine is an unprecedented one for the U.S. and underlines the precarious state of the conflict.

The Story Of Russia’s Secretive RS-26 Intermediate Range Ballisti...	The Russian missile at the center of an unprecedented strike on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro earlier today has been identified by Russia’s President Vladimir Putin as an alleged new weapon, named Oreshnik. After the strike, the missile had been widely — although not conclusively — identified as the RS-26 Rubezh. Development work on this mysterious strategic weapon system was supposed halted in 2018, although the Pentagon now states that whatever missile was used today in Dnipro was based on the RS-26, suggesting the design was revived at least to a degree, and has now been used in combat. You can read our initial report on the Dnipro missile strike here, as well as our analysis of Putin’s claims around the Oreshnik — described as a medium-range or intermediate-range 'hypersonic' missile — here. Note: The missile shown at the top of this story is the RS-24 Yars intercontinental ballistic missile, a weapon on which the RS-26 is widely assessed to be based. First off, it’s worth recalling that the RS-26 is widely viewed as an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), a class of weapon that has a range of somewhere between approximately 1,860 and 3,410 miles — based on the ranges it achieved in tests. However, Russia has previously described it as an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), a type of weapon that can hit targets at more than around 3,410 miles. Ok, two reasons why I think Russia probably used a variant of the long-gestating RS-26 Rubezh IRBM: (1) Russia hinted that it resumed development of the RS-26 this summer and (2) that's what the Ukrainians predicated a day ago, down to the launch site. Dr. Jeffrey Lewis (@ArmsControlWonk) November 21, 2024 The reason for this discrepancy likely lies primarily in Russia having sought to remain within the limits of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, which outlawed ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges of 500 to 5,500 kilometers (310 and 3,410 miles). The INF collapsed in 2019. Some reports mentioned the RS-26 missile. Even if we believe them, RS-26 is not really an intercontinental missile. It was tested at the range of more than 5500 km, but it is in effect an intermediate-range missile, (think of it as SS-20 2.0): russianforces.org/blog/2017/07&#8230; 2/&mdash; Pavel Podvig (@russianforces.org) 2024-11-21T10:11:00.678Z However, it could explain why the Ukrainian military initially reported that the missile that struck Dnipro was an ICBM — a claim that many Western officials subsequently denied, pointing instead to the RS-26 or an RS-26 derivative. Regardless, there is now a growing consensus that the missile used was a conventionally armed IRBM based on the RS-26. The launch site appears to have been Kapustin Yar, roughly 500 miles from the target. As for the RS-26, this is a solid-fueled, road-mobile missile that has been described in the past as a smaller derivative of the RS-24 Yars ICBM, although the exact relationship is unclear. Development of the RS-26 began around 2008 by the Moscow Institute of Thermal Technology. The missile is reportedly around 39 feet long and has a diameter of just under six feet. A road-mobile RS-24 Yars ICBM, from which the Russians reportedly developed the RS-26. Vitaly Kuzmin A first, unsuccessful test launch occurred at Plesetsk in September 2011. In a second test in May 2012, Russia demonstrated that the RS-26 could reach an intercontinental range, although it was widely assumed that this was only achieved with a light payload or no payload at all. Subsequent tests strongly indicated the missile couldn't fly beyond intermediate ranges with an actual warhead, which would have put it in contravention of the INF had it been fielded operationally prior to 2019. Amid this controversy, Russia had officially pulled the plug on the potentially treaty-busting RS-26 in 2018. In March of that year, only weeks after Russian President Vladimir Putin mentioned it in a provocative speech, Russia reportedly decided to shelve the development of the Rubezh, dropping it from the state armament plan for 2018 to 2027. Instead, the country would focus on fielding the nuclear-armed Avangard hypersonic boost-glide vehicle weapon. Previously, Putin had stated that the RS-26 would also serve as the primary launch vehicle for Avangard. A Russian Ministry of Defense video reportedly showing Avangard prototypes and a computer-generated depiction of its operational concept. 'The Avangard was included in the [state armament plan] program’s final version as more essential to ensure the country’s defense capability,' a Russian defense industry source said, according to state-run media outlet TASS. 'All the work on the Rubezh and the Barguzin [rail-mobile ICBM] was put on hold until the end of 2027. A decision on the work’s resumption will be made after the current armament program is fulfilled.' Without the RS-26, the Avangard has instead been fielded in a silo-based form loaded onto repurposed rocket boosters from old UR-100N UTTKh ICBMs. The hypersonic boost-glide vehicle may also become a payload option for the silo-launched RS-28 Sarmat ICBM, which has had a troubled development. There is clear evidence that a new RS-28 test launch earlier ended in disaster. A test launch of the RS-28 Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile. Russian Ministry of Defense screencap www.twz.com It was unclear exactly why Russia abandoned the RS-26, although it may simply have been a financial decision, especially with competition from a range of other advanced strategic capabilities the country is also pursuing. Cost concerns were certainly raised in the TASS reporting in 2018. 'It was initially planned to include both the Avangard and the [RS-26] Rubezh in the state armament plan,' the anonymous defense industry source told TASS. 'It became clear later that funds would not suffice to finance both systems at a time.' There may have been other issues, as well. After all, prior to being mentioned again in 2018, there had been scant official mention of the RS-26 at all for years. The Kremlin was supposed to demonstrate the system to arms control inspectors from the United States first in 2015 and then in 2016, but both of these inspections were missed. However, in a 2021 report, the Pentagon stated that, despite the reports in the Russian press, work on the RS-26 and testing of associated equipment continued at least into 2018. With the demise of INF and the deepening tensions between Russia and NATO, it could be that Moscow has revisited the RS-26, perhaps in the form of the Oreshnik, although there is no evidence that either missile has so far been operationally deployed. Asked for his reflections on the Dnipro strike, and prior to the Oreshnik disclosure, Pavel Podvig, a Senior Researcher in the WMD Program at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR), told TWZ that the missile used could have been an RS-26 — employed on an experimental basis — or perhaps some new type of missile in the same class. If that were the case, the new missile, Oreshnik or otherwise, would likely be very similar to the RS-26, according to Podvig’s assessment. We don't know yet what this is and I leave it to the true OSINT experts to determine the novelty of the missile.But I'd be shocked if Russia managed to build an MIRVed MRBM without relying to at least 90% on an existing designs and cannibalizing RS-26 (or other missile) parts… Fabian Hoffmann (@FRHoffmann1) November 21, 2024 As to the likelihood of Russia having returned to developing IRBMs, more generally, Podvig says it’s 'entirely possible' that Russia might have revived the RS-26 program. 'I wouldn’t be surprised if there was some effort to create a missile that would be kind of similar to RS-26, or SS-20 and things like that. I would not be surprised if design bureaus started putting together a project of that kind,' he added. There is also the possibility that, if a version of the RS-26 was used, this was simply a case of using up one of the non-operational or even prototype rounds in a combat mission, albeit now rebranded as Oreshnik. The combination of range to target (roughly 500 miles), the ability to evade Ukrainian air defenses, and the powerful signaling may simply have been too tempting for Russia. The RS-26 program was mothballed in 2018 russianforces.org/blog/2018/04&#8230; One cannot rule out that RS-26 was taken out of its &#034;retirement&#034; for a strike. This implies that Russia had a number of these missiles in storage for almost ten years. Not impossible, but rather unlikely. 3/&mdash; Pavel Podvig (@russianforces.org) 2024-11-21T10:11:00.679Z At the same time, using an IRBM of any kind for an operational strike will also provide Russia with very valuable information. After all, no ICBM or IRBM has ever been used in combat before. While the precise identity of the missile used remains a mystery for now, it’s also unclear what kind of payload it was carrying. When it was developed, the RS-26 was expected to carry either a single nuclear warhead or a nuclear multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) payload — both options were tested in 2013. The Avangard was, for a while, also seen as an RS-26 payload. Clearly, the missile that targeted Dnipro was either conventionally armed or perhaps, unarmed. Videos of the strike show what appears to be six warheads hurtling toward the ground, consistent with MIRVs. The Ukrainian Air Force confirmed that Russia struck the Ukrainian city of Dnipro with a conventionally armed ICBM this morning, marking the first combat use of an ICBM in history. Footage from Dnipro showed glowing reentry vehicles hitting the ground around 5 AM local time. pic.twitter.com/PWTGajH9bT&mdash; OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) November 21, 2024 Podvig told us that an unarmed RS-26 (or similar IRBM) is 'not entirely impossible,' but also raised the possibility of the missile being fitted with small explosive warheads. There is also the potential that the missile was carrying decoys or a combination of small conventional warheads and decoys. No big visible explosions indicate small warheads6 groups of 6 projectiles means that you likely had 6 missiles with 6 large submunitions eachWhile this can be ie 3 MIRVs in inert configuration and 3 heavy decoys I think the simpler explanation would be 6 heavy submunitions.&mdash; krakek (@krakek1) November 21, 2024 A conventionally armed IRBM is an interesting proposition and it’s not clear if this would have been developed specifically for this strike, or for use in Ukraine more generally, or if it might reflect a broader interest in Russia to field conventional versions of its strategic missiles. Russia is not known to have looked at developing conventionally armed IRBMs/ICBMs, although, in the past, TWZ has looked at the potential arguments for doing just that — albeit in the case of Israel. Amid a worsening crisis involving Iran, we examined the possibility of Israel launching an attack using a conventionally armed version of its Jericho IRBM — best known as a launch vehicle for the Israeli nuclear deterrent. The same arguments could apply to Russia, which might want to make an extremely powerful show of force in the hope of signaling to the West that it should not become more deeply involved in the war in Ukraine. This is especially true for deterring the U.S. and its partners from allowing expanded targeting for its donated weapons inside of Russian borders. It's a signal. Whatever RS-26 true range or purpose, it's classified by Russia as a &#034;strategic&#034; system. Its use is meant to cross a threshold. And seems highly likely it is intended to mirror ATACMS use in Russia.&mdash; Shashank Joshi (@shashj.bsky.social) 2024-11-21T09:27:05.796Z Tellingly, soon after the United States and other allies last week allowed Ukraine to launch long-range missiles into Russia, officials in Moscow warned that they might use a weapon never previously employed on Ukrainian territory. Using a conventionally armed IRBM may well be a response in kind to that decision by the relevant Western powers. Not only is such a missile immune to Ukrainian air defenses but it also delivers a very robust message and one that will resonate across Europe. After all, this is a missile that can reach targets anywhere in the continent and which, on another day, could be topped with a nuclear warhead. If the missile was indeed filled with decoys and perhaps didn’t even carry highly-destructive conventional warheads, that would very much point to signaling being the desired effect. On the other hand, a high-explosive warhead would be extremely destructive and might well be selected for a particularly important or heavily defended target. Should Russia want to target hardened or buried command centers and other key fortified sites in Ukraine, then it might call upon the same types of missiles again — provided they are available in sufficient numbers. Even demonstrating such a capability is significant, since Ukraine’s air defenses mean that Russia could use such missiles to strike anywhere in the country with impunity. Again, if a conventional warhead can be used in this way, the implications of using a nuclear warhead become obvious. Russian war planners would have to weigh all this up against the possibility that Ukraine and NATO might misconstrue an incoming conventionally armed IRBM as a nuclear one. However, it should be recalled that all of the ballistic and cruise missiles launched against Ukraine so far by Russia also have the capability to carry nuclear payloads. As we suspected, it is now widely understood that Russia warned the U.S. of its intended strike by a conventionally armed strategic weapon prior to launch. Ultimately, we will need to wait for more evidence to determine the relationship between the RS-26 and the Oreshnik. It seems certain, however, that Russia has launched an unprecedented attack — and one that does not have a historical parallel.

Pros And Cons Of The Navy’s Controversial Submarine-Launched Nucl...	As President-elect Donald Trump nears his return to the White House, the U.S. Navy’s nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missile (SLCM-N) program started during his first term is potentially returning to the spotlight as well. It remains unclear whether Trump’s second term will put wind in the sails for the program, which President Joe Biden proposed canceling in the 2022 Nuclear Posture Review. Questions remain about whether the deterrent juice is worth the financial and resource squeeze to field SLCM-N and its warhead in the next decade, and the potential role it could play in escalating hostilities, not lessening them. Concerns also persist about whether it will irrevocably change the very nature of the American attack submarine force, and if all those dollars could be better spent elsewhere. While the Navy has proceeded with standing up the program as required by Congress, sea service leaders have increasingly expressed concern about whether it’s a wise allocation of finite resources. And despite Biden White House and Navy hesitancy, Congress has continued to fund the program. But supporters argue that SLCM-N would provide a much-needed sea-based nuclear deterrent that is a rung below the strategic level on the nuclear warfare ladder, and that the commander-in-chief is owed a bevy of such options. Like its predecessor, the U.S. Navy’s scuppered nuclear-armed Tomahawk Land Attack Missile-Nuclear (TLAM-N), SLCM-N is envisioned as a lower-yield nuclear weapon launched from subs that would provide a new dimension to the maritime portion of the nuclear triad while allowing the United States to proportionately respond to a limited nuclear strike by an adversary. The guided-missile cruiser USS Monterey (CG 61) fires a Tomahawk land attack missile on April 14, 2018. (U.S. Navy) Seaman Trey Fowler 'It’s part of an overall ability to build a flexible reaction, flexible deterrent,' Bradley Martin, a retired Navy surface warfare officer and current senior policy researcher at the RAND think tank, told The War Zone. 'Being sea-based, it does allow concealment and less vulnerability than there might be if it’s sitting on an attack aircraft someplace.' Meanwhile, a Navy request for information published on November 15 offers some of the most specific information released to date about how the Navy envisions outfitting SLCM-N in the Virginia class attack submarine fleet. The RFI is part of Navy 'market research' focused 'on rapid development, integration, and demonstration' of an SLCM-N 'all-up round,' or a missile delivered ready to load onto an attack submarine. It seeks white papers featuring industry perspectives 'on either weapon system integration, cruise missile prototype development, or cruise missile subsystems.' The request further notes that all nuclear warhead installation and missile storage, as well as missile onloading and offloading, will take place at existing ballistic missile submarine facilities at Kings Bay, Georgia, and Bangor, Washington. Any prototype must be able to be launched from a 87-inch Virginia Payload Tube, a Virginia Payload Module, or both. The Virginia Payload Tubes are mounted forward of the sail and house vertical launch cells for cruise missiles (primarily). The Virginia Payload Module will be installed on new Virginia class submarines and is large four tube vertical launch system structure that is installed amidships. (U.S. Navy) The Navy is also looking for missiles that are 'as modular as possible,' including software and hardware, so that changes to the core missile body or common tactical systems don’t require changes to warhead payload interfaces or avionics 'associated with the nuclear mission.' 'This open system approach is being pursued to allow for future technical insertion or technology upgrades as required through the life of the SLCM-N program,' the Navy’s request states. The request also seeks the ability to break the missile into nuclear and non-nuclear parts. 'Technology proposed for the SLCM-N flight system must be producible and fieldable to meet an FY 2034 initial operational capability,' the RFI states. 'However, prototypes will be required within 3 years.' Still, much remains unclear about how this missile system will eventually manifest. The Navy has not released details regarding how many missiles it would plan to buy or the work that will be required to outfit submarines with the system. Even basing them at Trident facilities, which primarily host nuclear ballistic submarines, seems like a major hurdle to deploying them regularly. The Congressional Budget Office estimated in July 2023 that the SLCM-N and its warhead could cost $10 billion from 2023 to 2032, and that such costs don’t include 'systems integration, storage or operations.' Count Vice Adm. Johnny Wolfe, director of the Navy Strategic Systems Programs (NSSP), is one of the SLCM-N skeptics. Wolfe’s office overseas the seaborne leg of America’s nuclear triad. Speaking at the Navy Submarine League’s annual conference last week, Wolfe called existing plans to reach initial capability for SLCM-N by 2034 'a very, very aggressive timeline,' Sydney J. Freedberg Jr. of Breaking Defense reported. According to that outlet, Wolfe also warned in his conference remarks that the program would basically require an entire new workforce and industrial base, at a time when the Navy and American defense giants are struggling to deliver new ships and get existing ships out of maintenance on time. 'This is truly a capability we have to build from the ground up,' Breaking Defense quoted Wolfe as saying. Wolfe also quashed the idea of the Navy simply recreating a nuclear Tomahawk from the Cold War era. 'We can’t reconstitute that, okay?' Breaking Defense quoted Wolfe as saying. 'It’s not that easy.' A Navy spokesperson later confirmed to Breaking Defense that Wolfe was referring to producing an appropriate missile, and not the nuclear warhead, which would be the responsibility of the U.S. Energy Department. 'The requirement to deliver SLCM-N would increase the capacity requirement amongst industry to a level that had not previously been accounted for,' the spokesperson said, according to Breaking Defense. Sailors assigned to the submarine tender USS Emory S. Land (AS 39) weapons handling division conduct an offload of a Tomahawk missile from the Los Angeles-class fast-attack submarine USS Asheville (SSN 758) in Guam in 2022. (U.S. Navy) Petty Officer 1st Class Victoria Kinney While some brass has expressed skepticism over the program, the Biden administration also warned in July 2023 of the trade-offs in going forward with SLCM-N. Namely, in a policy statement, the White House said that deploying the system 'would reduce capacity for conventional strike munitions, create additional burdens on naval training, maintenance and operations, and could create additional risks to the Navy’s ability to operate in key regions,' according to a report this month on the program by the Congressional Research Service. Indeed, taking SLCM-N to sea would require standing up a bevy of new Navy systems and protocols, as deploying and supporting nuclear weapons is a different reality compared to conventional munitions. New security protocols and personnel would have to be deployed. Highly specific surveillance and maintenance requirements would have to be enacted. This is in addition to specialized and highly secure communications systems needing to be installed and sustained in order to receive nuclear strike orders through proper channels. Such a capability would also require additional vetting and training of sailors assigned to such vessels. 'It’s perfectly valid to say there’s considerable costs that would go with putting this on a SSN,' Martin said. 'There would be security protocols, command-and-control protocols that would have to be added.' Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro also warned in testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee in May that the program would 'fundamentally change the mission of many of these submarines themselves.' Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro testifies to the Senate Armed Services Committee in May. (U.S. Navy) Petty Officer 2nd Class Jared Mancuso Del Toro noted that the Navy had stood up an SLCM-N program management office as required by law, but that he remained concerned that the program would 'operationally impact' Navy submarines’ ability to do their jobs in the Pacific and elsewhere. 'That actually will prevent us perhaps from doing the things that we need to do tactically and operationally, by providing this SLCM capability to the submarine.' Del Toro also noted how this 'multi-billion dollar program' will prevent the naval enterprise from taking on other pricey priorities. The Navy said in 2022 that canceling the effort would save the service nearly $200 million in Fiscal Year 2023 alone, and $2.1 billion in the next five years, according to the CRS. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has also questioned the effort, testifying that year that 'the marginal capability that [the SLCM-N] provides is far outweighed by the cost,' the CRS notes. But supporters of the program argue that the main reason for American subs in the first place is deterrence, and giving the president an additional submarine-launched tactical nuclear option has major advantages. The U.S. Navy has already fielded a lower-yield nuclear strike option in the form of the W76-2 warhead loaded onto an unspecified number of Ohio class nuclear ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs), boats that are already set up to fire nuclear weapons. Concerns over an adversary not knowing if a Trident launch is packing a low-yield or much more powerful payload is also an issue. The cruise missile delivery system fired by SSNs solves this issue to some degree, but also introduces others in terms of strategic ambiguity. If these boats can fire nuclear-armed cruise missiles, then will any cruise missile be interpreted as such during a crisis? Still, proponents think fielding the weapon is worth the effort. It provides 'significant flexibility to manage a crisis,' Franklin C. Miller, a former senior defense official and National Security Council staffer, wrote in Real Clear Defense this summer. And while it doesn’t these days, the U.S. Navy’s non-ballistic missile-equipped fleet does have a history of carrying nuclear weapons, Miller writes. 'Throughout the Cold War, U.S. carriers deployed with nuclear gravity bombs and ASW weapons; surface combatants carried a range of nuclear-tipped anti-air and ASW weapons; and SSNs carried nuclear-tipped torpedoes and the SUBROC ASW systems,' he writes. 'From the 1980s until the end of the Cold War, surface ships and SSNs also carried nuclear Tomahawks (and those nuclear Tomahawks contributed significantly to deterring Soviet nuclear attacks on our aircraft carriers).' The battleship USS Missouri fires a Tomahawk missile. (U.S. Navy) Several military leaders have also echoed the contention that the commander–in-chief should have several tailored tactical nuclear weapons options at their disposal. Miller cites repeated testimony by Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti saying that 'SLCM-N is a tailored option the President should have,' while a recent CRS report notes then-Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley expressed support for SLCM-N to Congress in April 2022, noting that the president 'deserves to have multiple options.' Of course, the President does have multiple options outside the Navy’s leg of the nuclear triad. The Air Force has B-61 tactical nuclear bombs that currently equip certain fighters and B-2 bombers, which are highly flexible assets that can deal with broadcasting strategic intent and executing proportional strikes if called upon to do so. That service also has air-launched nuclear cruise missiles in its arsenal. As President-elect Trump’s inauguration nears, and his politically appointed defense and Navy secretaries get to work, whether SLCM-N will return to prominence remains to be seen, but considering the program was born out of his last administration, it’s a definite possibility. At the least, it’s a program that warrants 'a really careful look,' Martin said. 'It’s costly and it definitely would create operational challenges and considerations for submarines,' he told The War Zone. 'Is there a deterrent effect, and is it useful? Does it cause adversaries to think differently? If so, it potentially is worth the cost.'

Russia’s Experimental Ballistic Missile Used To Strike Ukraine Is...	We are now getting details about the weapon used in the unprecedented attack on Ukraine earlier today, with Russian President Vladimir Putin saying his country's forces fired a previously unknown medium-range 'hypersonic' missile called Oreshnik. The new missile is based on the previous RS-26 Rubezh ballistic missile, according to the Pentagon. Readers can get up to speed on what else is already known about the missile strike on the eastern Ukrainian city of Dnipro in The War Zone's initial reporting here. Ukrainain authorities had initially claimed that the weapon Russia fired today was an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Subsequent reports citing anonymous U.S. government officials have said that it was actually a medium or intermediate-range ballistic missile (MRBM/IRBM). The RS-26 is officially categorized as an ICBM, but experts have long assessed that it is more likely an IRBM. MRBMs, IRBMs, and ICBMs are categorized by their maximum ranges – between 620 and 1,860 miles (1,000 and 3,000 kilometers), between 1,864 and 3,418 miles (3,000 to 5,500 kilometers), and greater than 3,418 miles (5,500 kilometers), respectively. 'In response to the use of American and British weaponry on November 21 this year, Russian armed forces conducted a combined strike on one of Ukraine's defense-industrial complex facilities,' Putin said in a televised address. 'This included testing one of Russia's latest medium-range missile systems in combat conditions. In this case, a ballistic missile equipped with non-nuclear hypersonic technology, referred to as Oreshnik by our missile forces.' Statement by the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir PutinWatch herein in full (dubbed in English) pic.twitter.com/mF5SCJdlq1&mdash; MFA Russia (@mfa_russia) November 21, 2024 'Targets for engagement during further testing of our newest missile complexes will be determined based on threats to the security of the Russian Federation,' he added. 'When selecting targets for such systems as Oreshnik on Ukrainian territory, we will ensure that civilians, as well as citizens of friendly nations present in those areas, are advised to leave potential danger zones in advance. This will be done openly, publicly, and out of humanitarian considerations, without fear of opposition from the enemy.' In his remarks, Putin said that Oreshnik (which means 'hazel' in Russian, keeping with the country's tradition of naming ballistic missiles after trees) had a peak speed of Mach 10, but provided no other details about the weapon. He also made no mention of any connection to the RS-26, work on which was publicly shelved in 2018. Imagery from today's attack on Ukraine looks to show six warheads descending on the target and multiple resulting impacts. Better footage of the alleged impacts of multiple warheads separated from a Russian ICBM in Dnipro earlier today.&mdash; Status-6 (Military & Conflict News) (@archer83able.bsky.social) 2024-11-21T10:10:24.907Z 'I can confirm that Russia did launch an experimental intermediate-range ballistic missile,' Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said at a routine press conference today. 'This IRBM was based on Russia's RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile model' Pentagon:- Russia's experimental intermediate-range ballistic missile launched at Ukraine was based on the RS-26 Rubezh ICBM model;- The US was notified by Russia about the launch briefly before it occurred through nuclear risk reduction channels.&mdash; Status-6 (Military & Conflict News) (@archer83able.bsky.social) 2024-11-21T19:57:18.465Z Singh added that the U.S. government had been notified about the launch beforehand through Nuclear Risk Reduction channels. We raised this very real possibility in our initial report. This contradicts separate remarks from Dmitry Peskov, spokesperson for Putin, who said today that Russia has no obligation to make such notification for launches of medium-range weapons. Russia did not send advance notifications to the United States or other countries about the use of the Oreshnik hypersonic missile on a Ukrainian military-industrial facility as there are no such obligations, Dmitry Peskov told TASS: pic.twitter.com/ieldbKB8hM&mdash; TASS (@tassagency_en) November 21, 2024 'Russia launched an experimental intermediate-range ballistic missile against Ukraine,' another U.S. government official also told The War Zone directly. 'While we take all threats against Ukraine seriously, it is important to keep a few key facts in mind. Russia likely possesses only a handful of these experimental missiles.' The RS-26 is itself reportedly a smaller derivative of the RS-24 Yars ICBM. Rubezh is also understood to have a multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) configuration and was associated in the past with the development of the Avangard hypersonic boost-glide vehicle. Russia has publicly fielded Avangard in a silo-based configuration using a repurposed ICBM rocketed booster. Hypersonic boost-glide vehicles offer capabilities that are particularly hard to defend against, as you can read more about here. The video below shows an Avangard test in 2018. Whether Oreshnik carries standard re-entry vehicles, maneuvering ones, or true hypersonic boost-glide vehicles remains unknown. Larger ballistic missiles and their payloads, in general, typically reach hypersonic speeds. A picture said to show a piece of the Oreshnik after the attack looks to be a part that is also found in the Bulava submarine-launched ballistic missile and that is linked to the production of components for other Russian strategic ballistic missiles. 1/2 Just a small bit of OSINT on Russia's new 'Oreshnik' MRBM, allegedly used to strike Dnipro (per Putin): I found the exactly the same part on the Russian govt procurement site.

The war has already seen the first operational use of the Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile and the sea-launched Zircon air-breathing hypersonic cruise missile In addition, the introduction of a new ostensibly hypersonic weapon comes amid continued efforts to bolter Ukraine's air and missile defenses. Western-supplied Patriot surface-to-air missile systems have been notably effective against Kinzhal, as well as ground-launched ballistic missiles. At a peak speed of Mach 10, Oreshnik would be moving faster than a system like Patriot can reliably intercept. 'Existing modern air defense systems worldwide, including the missile defense systems created by Americans in Europe, cannot intercept such missiles. It’s impossible,' Putin explicitly boasted in his announcement about Oreshnik today. Using an experimental and expensive capability like Oreshnik, which also likely has lower accuracy in its conventional mode than existing long-range munitions that Russia has been using on Ukraine, is also clearly intended to send broader messages to Ukraine's foreign benefactors. Putin has not explicitly said it was in retaliation for Ukraine getting approval to employ U.S.-made Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) short-range ballistic missiles and British-supplied Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missiles against targets in Russia. 'Ukraine has withstood countless attacks from Russia, including from missiles with significantly larger warheads than this weapon. Let me be clear: Russia may be seeking to use this capability to try to intimidate Ukraine and its supporters, or generate attention in the information space, but it will not be a game-changer in this conflict,' the aforementioned U.S. government official told The War Zone. 'We briefed Ukraine and close allies/partners in recent days about Russia’s possible use of this weapon to help them prepare.' 'As the President announced earlier this year, the United States is providing Ukraine with hundreds of additional Patriot and AMRAAM missiles to strengthen its air defenses. Many of these air defense missiles have been delivered already, as a consequence of the President's decision to divert air defense exports to Ukraine, and deliveries of additional air defense missiles to Ukraine are ongoing,' they continued. 'And, as the President directed in September, the United States will continue to surge security assistance to Ukraine to strengthen capabilities, including air defense, and put Ukraine in the best possible position on the battlefield. Just yesterday, we announced another security assistance package and those efforts will continue until the end of the President’s term.' With Putin's threat to continue employing Oreshniks, more information about the missile and its RS-26 predecessor may now start to emerge.

Russia’s Unprecedented Ballistic Missile Attack On Ukraine: What ...	The Ukrainian Air Force claims that Russia launched a conventionally armed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) today at the city of Dnipro, in the center of the country. They offered no proof and some U.S. and Western officials are pushing back on the specific ICBM claim, stating that an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) was used. In either case, the act is unprecedented for the war in Ukraine and it would mark the first use of either one of these types of weapons in combat anywhere. Officials in Moscow had previously warned they might use a weapon never previously employed on Ukrainian territory, in response to the United States and other allies last week allowing Ukraine to fire long-range missiles into Russia. Among the conflicting claims about exactly what kind of missile was used, but it appears that it was a ballistic missile with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) capability. Videos emerging on social media show what appears to be six warheads hurtling toward the ground and multiple impacts as a result. This analysis could change as more information comes available.

The maximum was about 11,000 kilometers [6,800 miles]. So I think it is entirely possible and shouldn’t be a problem for modern ICBMs, like Topol-M or Yars, they should be able to do 800 kilometers [500 miles]. If we’re talking about RS-26 then it’s even less of a problem, because, of course, it is a shorter-range missile, an intermediate-range missile, and so 800 kilometers would be perfectly within its capabilities. But we don’t know what kind of missile it is at this point.' Bearing in mind the fact that Russia has previously described the RS-26 as an ICBM, it could be that this is the descriptor that Ukraine is using, as well. In the meantime, U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey referred to reports that Russia had fired 'a new ballistic missile into Ukraine,' which could also apply to the RS-26, or a related missile. 'The way it worked with RS-26 for example, was that the project was kind of stopped sometime in the mid-2010s,' Podvig added. 'So maybe it could be a new type, similar to the RS-26, or maybe he meant that the RS-26 has never been deployed, has never been operational. So any kind of operational [RS-26] missile would be a missile of a new type. That’s hard to tell, but basically, there is not much you can do in terms of new types. The easiest thing is to take what they did before — using the stages from Yars — and basically make an RS-26 kind of missile.' As to whether the RS-26 program might have been revived, Podvig considers that a definite possibility. 'It is entirely possible that they are just going to revive the program,' Podvig said. 'That is possible, especially after the demise of the INF Treaty, I wouldn’t be surprised if there was some effort to create a missile that would be kind of similar to the RS-26, or SS-20 and things like that. That’s my take. I would not be surprised if design bureaus started putting together a project of that kind.' Hans Kristensen, Director of the Nuclear Information Project, Federation of American Scientists, added his thoughts on the possible missile used, in a post on X.

However, such weapons can provide a tactical advantage and certainly showcase a strategic message. Intercepting multiple warheads at the speed and angle of these weapons in the terminal phase is beyond what Ukraine's donated Patriot batteries can defend against. Defeating these weapons requires a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) or Aegis Ashore air defense system, David Shank, a retired Army colonel and former commandant of the Army Air Defense Artillery School at Ft. Sill, Oklahoma told us. The Ground-based Midcourse Defense missile defense system (GMD) would work best, he added. Ukraine has none of these systems. All the hubbub about nuclear threats means a lot of you are missing the fact that Russia may have just demonstrated a capability to strike strategic targets in Europe like airbases with a high impact cluster munition that evades 99% of NATO's air defense inventory.&mdash; Decker Eveleth (@dexeve.bsky.social) 2024-11-21T15:18:44.288Z Deploying these weapons also sends a message that Russia is willing to take another step up the escalation ladder in the wake of having its territory struck by U.S.-donated ground-launched Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) and U.K.-donated air-launched Storm Shadow long-range missiles. 'The strike itself proves: Russia does not seek peace,' Heorhil Tykhi, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry stated on X. 'To the contrary, it makes every effort to expand the war.'

Watch A Ukrainian Uncrewed Aerial Mothership Launch Kamikaze Dron...	Ukraine's domestically developed Dovbush T10 drone has taken on a new role acting as a mothership for first-person view (FPV) kamikaze quadcopters. In this configuration, the T10 also serves as a key signal relay node between the highly maneuverable one-way-attackers and their operators. Serhii Beskrestnov recently posted video, seen below, of an apparent test of a mothership T10 carrying two FPV kamikaze drones, one under each wing, on his Telegram channel. Beskrestnov (sometimes referred to by the pseudonyms Serhii Flash or Flesh; his first name can also be found written as Serhiy) is a Ukrainian servicemember who has been cited as an expert in 'radio technologies' and other military electronics. He regularly posts about new uncrewed aerial systems, electronic warfare, and other battlefield developments.

I find the way the FPV is attached to the wing amusing. The bomb acts as an adapter between the mothership and the FPV-Kamikaze. And the FPV itself hangs upside down&mdash; Special Kherson Cat (@specialkhersoncat.bsky.social) 2024-11-19T22:51:22.863Z In his Telegram post, Beskrestnov did not provide more details about the T10 mothership's capabilities, including its range and endurance and how far the FPVs can reach after launch. The T10 first emerged in late 2022 configured as a surveillance and reconnaissance platform with an unspecified sensor package and a reported range of just under 22 miles (35 kilometers). The drone can also be employed as a one-way-attacker with a nearly 26-and-a-half-pound (12-kilogram) warhead. In its baseline configuration, the design reportedly costs around $12,000. The T10's primary mode of launch appears to be via a rack installed on the top of a pickup truck, which gets it up to a suitable speed to fly off on its own. How it might be recovered after a mission is unclear. The design reportedly features a navigation package that can fall back in some way on inertial navigation system (INS) guidance if its GPS signal is jammed, something that is a major threat on the battlefield in Ukraine. At its most basic level, the T10 mothership offers a way to maximize the reach of typically short-range FPV drones by releasing them at the edge of its own combat radius. The FPVs also gain extra loiter time, which they could spend on identifying and/or maneuvering to their targets, or even waving off an initial attack run and coming back from a different, unexpected vector. Putting the signal relay on the mothership orbiting above also puts that node closer to where the FPVs are actually operating, making it easier to maintain connectivity. The graphic below offers a good visual depiction of the overall benefits of this combination. FPV drone mothership/relay concept of operations. Tyler Rogoway/The War Zone The T10 mothership is not the first such combination to emerge on the battlefield in Ukraine, with the Russians also employing larger drones as aerial launch platforms and signal relay nodes for FPVs.

AI-enabled targeting capabilities would be a huge boon for FPVs, especially in the terminal phase of flight, where human operators currently have to manually find targets and steer the drone into them. You can read more about the game-changing impacts AI is set to have on drone operations in this War Zone feature. However, blending launch platform and signal relay in a single mothership package already helps address many of the limitations. AI targeting could still help in the event that the relay is disrupted or the mothership is shot down. The Russians claim they have recovered a Ukrainian FPV with AI target acquisition and terminal guidance.Long awaited, these jam-resistant drones will hopefully soon appear frequently. pic.twitter.com/wARWRySdrL&mdash; Roy (@GrandpaRoy2) November 11, 2024 While Ukraine's T10-based drone mothership may not be the first such design to emerge in the conflict there, it is more evidence of the value this kind of combination offers already.

British Defense Cuts Hit All Three Services Hard	The United Kingdom has announced sweeping cuts of its Armed Forces as it seeks to save money, despite the precarious security situation in Europe and elsewhere. The Royal Air Force, British Army, and Royal Navy will also lose frontline equipment, and it’s not necessarily clear how capabilities will be maintained once these assets are withdrawn. Moreover, with a new defense review expected next year, there is the possibility of worse to come for the British Armed Forces. Speaking in parliament today, U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey outlined the plan, which will affect all three branches of the British military. The assets to be withdrawn include the following: The Royal Navy’s two Albion class amphibious assault ships, HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark will be taken out of service at the end of the year, around a decade earlier than planned — although their withdrawal has been threatened now for several years. With their retirement, the ability of the U.K. Royal Marines to launch land assaults from the sea will be notably reduced. A new class of amphibious warfare vessels, up to six Multi-Role Support Ships (MRSS), is being planned, with these expected to carry out a wider variety of operations, as you can read about here. However, these are only due to enter service beginning in the early 2030s, leaving a significant capability gap in the meantime. Concept artwork of the new Multi-Role Support Ship (MRSS). BMT The Royal Air Force will lose its fleet of 17 Puma battlefield mobility helicopters, together with 14 of the oldest Chinook heavy-lift helicopters used by the same service. The United Kingdom had already ordered new Chinooks to modernize that force, some of which date back to the very first deliveries of these helicopters in the early 1980s. However, today’s decision leaves a question mark over plans to replace the Puma fleet, under the New Medium Helicopter (NMH) program. There had already been suggestions that the NMH might also face the ax. A U.K. Royal Air Force Chinook helicopter on the flight deck of the aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales.

Although these have only been in service for six years, they have suffered a spate of crashes and have been widely criticized. You can read more about them here.

The warship was already in need of an expensive overhaul and was due for retirement. Interestingly, this particular warship collided with a Russian Navy submarine in the North Atlantic Ocean in 2020, and both vessels were reportedly damaged in the incident, which you can read more about here. Earlier this year, the Type 23 fleet had been reduced by two, with the decision to withdraw HMS Argyll and Westminster, reportedly in order to free up personnel to staff its new class of frigates. This reduced the service’s fleet of Type 23s to nine. All this comes at a time when the Royal Navy’s major surface combatants are in high demand, including in the Red Sea.

Crown Copyright LA(Phot) Dave Jenkins Defense Secretary Healey said the cuts would result in savings of up to £500 million — equivalent to around $633 million — over the next five years. Healey also defended the assets being withdrawn on the basis that they are 'outdated,' although this is a claim that doesn’t stack up for all the equipment affected, most notably the Watchkeeper drones. Despite their problems, these drones do offer certain critical capabilities, including ground moving-target indicator (GMTI), a radar mode that allows discrimination between moving targets on the ground and static ones, allowing it to track the activity of the moving targets over time.

'War in Europe, growing Russian aggression, conflict in the Middle East, and technology changing the nature of warfare. As a result, defense needs increased resilience and readiness for the future.' While that is certainly true, the truth is that, with some exceptions (notably Watchkeeper, again), this equipment is very much part of the U.K. Armed Forces’ resilience and readiness. Ultimately, the cuts are the result of tight budgets — something that the British military is becoming increasingly familiar with. A Watchkeeper drone in flight over the United Kingdom during a test flight. Watchkeepers have reportedly struggled to operate in the British climate. British Army Although working under greater financial pressure, the U.K. Armed Forces are also being called upon to restructure and modernize to better face the resurgent Russian threat, illustrated by the war in Ukraine and by a spike in ‘hybrid warfare’ activities across Europe, widely seen as being Kremlin-inspired. As well as Russia, the U.K. Armed Forces are also increasingly expected to play a more active role in the Indo-Pacific theater, not to mention in the Middle East, and a host of other global missions. These are significant ambitions, and, at the same time, the United Kingdom is committed to some hugely expensive ‘big ticket’ defense programs, including the replacement of the Royal Navy’s Trident submarine-based nuclear deterrent with the new Dreadnought class of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines, and the Tempest future combat aircraft. An infographic for the future Dreadnought class SSBN. BAE Systems While cuts have continued to be made, the U.K. government has remained committed to increasing the defense budget to 2.5 percent of GDP, a pledge that the defense secretary repeated today. However, he didn’t announce when this would come into effect. As it stands, the U.K. Armed Forces — like many others around the world — are being asked to do a lot more, with less. Removing older and expensive-to-operate equipment makes sense, so long as it’s being replaced by equivalent capabilities that are cheaper, but which also meet the demands of the latest force posture. A good example of this would be the Army’s Watchkeeper drones, which are not likely to be badly missed by many. On the other hand, there’s no doubt that uncrewed air systems are of growing importance on the battlefield and British efforts in this direction have so far achieved very mixed results. If the money saved by withdrawing Watchkeeper doesn’t help drive the development and fielding of more reliable drones for the Army, then questions will likely be asked.

Russian aggression is seeing the U.K. Armed Forces re-posture to fight a potential conflict in Europe, adding yet more demands on its three branches. Crown Copyright Corporal Rebecca Brown, RLC There is also the possibility of more cuts to come. After all, the U.K. government is expected to release its latest defense review next spring, and that might see another raft of cuts to all three services. With funds for defense spending limited, there will be fears that more equipment might be axed, as an easy option for making short-term savings. Overall, however, today’s cuts reflect the very harsh decisions facing the U.K. government as it seeks to meet the goal of a British military that is increasing its 'resilience and readiness' to meet a wider range of threats, not just from Russia.

ICBM Reentry Vehicle Capability Still Unproven By North Korea U.S...	The U.S. military has not seen demonstrable evidence of North Korea successfully testing a re-entry vehicle capable of bringing a nuclear warhead back down to Earth through the atmosphere, according to America's top officer in the Pacific region. The North Koreans are actively working on this technology, which is essential for long-range ballistic missiles with exo-atmospheric flight profiles, especially intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) able to reach the United States. 'All will have been aware by now that North Korea tested its largest ballistic missile, having reached an apogee of over 7,000 kilometers [approximately 4,349.5 miles], portending a capability that will have the ability to range the entire continental United States,' U.S. Navy Adm. Samuel Paparo said in opening remarks at an open event at the Brookings Institution think tank yesterday. Paparo is head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) and was referring to North Korea's first test launch of the Hwasong-19 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), claimed to be its longest-ranged design to date, on October 31. North Korean authorities said the missile reached a peak height of 7,687.5 kilometers (approximately 4776.8 miles). The Hwasong-19 was fired from this massive transporter-erector-launcher (TEL). North Korean State Media 'Do we know much about the North Koreans' ability to bring a re-entry vehicle safely back through the atmosphere and whether they would themselves have any confidence that they could do that?' Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow and director of research in the Foreign Policy program at Brookings, subsequently asked Paparo. 'Because it's one thing to range North America. It's something else to be able to bring a warhead [down] and detonate it.' 'Not yet. We've not yet seen that capability, but we just see continued testing towards that,' the INDOPACOM commander said in response. Designing a re-entry vehicle that can survive the physical and thermal stresses of hurtling down to Earth through the atmosphere at hypersonic speeds is a complex proposition. That vehicle also has to be able to keep any payload inside, such as a nuclear warhead, safe and be reliably and accurately able to reach the desired detonation point, which only adds to the challenge. A view of Earth, as purportedly seen from a camera mounted on the Hwasong-19 launched on October 31. North Korean State Media There is no debate that North Korea has been actively pursuing re-entry vehicle technology, which is critical for fielding a real ICBM capability, for years. The regime in Pyongyang has claimed to have successfully developed this capability in the past and to have progressed to work on multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRV). Observers have suggested that the Hwasong-19 has the hallmarks of design intended for a MIRV payload. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un inspects a thermonuclear warhead design in 2017. A graphic showing what looks to be a re-entry vehicle design is seen in the background. North Korean State Media A MIRVed missile could strike multiple targets, potentially hundreds of miles apart, and/or lob several warheads at a single target area to increase the likelihood of achieving total destruction. Multiple incoming re-entry vehicles increase the challenges for defenders, especially if they are mixed in with decoys and other countermeasures. Paparo's comments yesterday underscore that there remains no definitive evidence available, at least publicly, to support North Korea's re-entry vehicle claims. At the same time, it is important to stress here that North Korea could still potentially at least attempt an IBCM strike against the United States, or a similarly ranged target area, without having a re-entry vehicle capability that the U.S. military has conclusively assessed to be functional. It could also seek to cause a massive global disruption by detonating nuclear warheads in space, something The War Zone has explored in the past. 'The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has assessed that North Korea’s Hwasong-14/KN20 intercontinental-range ballistic missile (ICBM) test launch on July 28[, 2017] failed to demonstrate successful atmospheric reentry,' The Diplomat reported back in 2017, citing anonymous U.S. government sources. 'The same assessment, however, notes that North Korea’s ICBM reentry vehicles would likely perform adequately if flown on a normal trajectory to continental U.S. targets.' The video below includes clips of the Hwasong-14 launch on July 28, 2017. 'The CIA assessment notes that based on the two observed flight tests of the Hwasong-14 to date, North Korea’s reentry vehicle technology is likely sufficiently advanced to pose no performance problem should the missile be fired at a minimum energy trajectory,' that story added. 'The assessment of the reentry vehicle is supported by analysis of data 'gathered from ground, sea, and air-based sensors' by the U.S. National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC).' In his remarks yesterday, Adm. Paparo also highlighted growing military cooperation between North Korea and Russia and the worrisome impacts that might have in the future. 'So North Korea has contributed [ballistic] missiles &#8230; directly used [by Russia] against Ukraine. They have contributed artillery shells that have been directly used against Ukraine. Now they have directly contributed soldiers &#8230; [and] they're being directly used against Ukraine,' Paparo noted. 'I would expect coming back will be submarine technology and propulsion technology.' News that North Korea had started construction of a new submarine, which could feature nuclear propulsion, had emerged in October. Last year, the North Koreans also formally unveiled a heavily reworked Cold War-era Romeo class diesel-electric submarine modified to fire ballistic missiles, seen below. North Korean State Media North Korea's new-ish missile submarine. KCNA The War Zone has pointed out in the past that re-entry vehicle technology, something Russia has significant experience with, could well be something else North Korean authorities might seek in return for their support in the ongoing fighting in Ukraine. The Russians also possess other missile technology that could feed into North Korean developments. 'At this point, it’s very early in &#8230; our assessment phase, and we don’t see any indication at this point that there was Russian involvement,' U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said at a press conference alongside Secretary of State Antony Blinken, as well as their respective South Korean counterparts, on October 31. 'But again, we’ll continue to work with our partners and our allies in the region to analyze this.' North Korea also has close ties to China and Iran, which also both have very active ballistic missile programs. Over the past decade or so, North Korea has conducted tests of a significant number of new liquid and solid-fuel ballistic missiles, including multiple ICBM designs, as well as hypersonic and long-range cruise missiles. This further includes types that North Korean officials say are capable of carrying nuclear warheads, something the country also looks to be stepping production of. The Hermit Kingdom has also demonstrated its ability to fire ballistic missiles from a wide array of static and mobile launchers, including ones emplaced at the bottom of lakes and rail-based systems. As underscored by the Hwasong-19 test, North Korea's missile and nuclear weapons programs continue to be very active. Though Adm. Paparo says the U.S. military has not seen evidence of a successful demonstration of re-entry vehicle capability, the North Koreans are clearly pushing ahead toward that goal.

Danish Navy Shadows Chinese Cargo Ship After Baltic Sea Cable Dam...	Denmark has confirmed it’s monitoring the Chinese cargo vessel at the center of allegations surrounding recent damage to two communication cables in the Baltic Sea. Yesterday, Germany said that the damage was most likely the result of sabotage, while the Chinese ship, the Yi Peng 3, was identified as having been operating in the vicinity of the cables when the incidents occurred.

In summary, the first of these is the 135-mile-long BSC cable between the Swedish island of Gotland and Lithuania, which was damaged around 8:00 a.m. GMT last Sunday. The second is C-Lion 1, a 746-mile-long cable between Helsinki and the German port of Rostock, put out of action around 2:00 a.m. GMT on Monday.

Based on publicly available ship-tracking data, the Yi Peng 3 appears to have passed overhead both of the cables at around the same time as the incidents of damage were first reported. According to the German newspaper Kieler Nachrichten, on Monday, when the damage to the C-Lion 1 cable was confirmed, the Yi Peng 'stopped, drifted, and sailed two circles in the sea area south of Öland for almost 90 minutes.' The Chinese cargo vessel was seen to slow down as it passed the cables, based on data gathered by auonsson, an open-source intelligence analyst. 'The speed of cargo ship Yi Peng 3 was affected negatively as she passed the two Baltic Sea cable breaks C-Lion 1 and BSC,' auonsson wrote on the social media platform Bluesky. 'Before the incidents, she held normal speeds. After stopping and drifting for 70 minutes she again held normal speeds. By this time the two cables were broken.'

The changes in speed are much more significant than the changes in wind speed,' auonsson adds.

By this time the two cables were broken.&mdash; auonsson (@auonsson.bsky.social) 2024-11-19T10:56:44.536Z So far, no official evidence has been presented that ties the Yi Peng 3 down to these incidents, although, as we noted previously, there is a notable precedent. In October last year, the Balticconenctor gas pipeline running between Estonia and Finland was damaged. The Finnish National Bureau of Investigation later identified the culprit as the Chinese container ship Newnew Polar Bear, which had dropped its anchor, dragging it along the seabed.

Photo by HEIKKI SAUKKOMAA/Lehtikuva/AFP via Getty Images HEIKKI SAUKKOMAA The Newnew Polar Bear had earlier been spotted with one of its anchors missing and the same type of paint on the anchor could be matched to that on the damaged pipeline. Chinese authorities later admitted that the Newnew Polar Bear was to blame but stated that it was an accident. However, the rapid departure of the Newnew Polar Bear from the Baltic last October fueled suspicions that the pipeline damage might have been an act of sabotage. With that in mind, it would make sense for the Danish authorities to investigate the Yi Peng 3 before it transits into international waters and continues its journey.

If the Yi Peng 3 is found to have been responsible for the damage, questions will very likely be asked about how that could have happened — especially since two cables in separate locations were affected. Moreover, with the precedent of the Newnew Polar Bear incident last year, there will likely be concerns that this could be evidence of some sort of broader, deliberate campaign in the highly strategic Baltic region. We will update this post if more information becomes available.

U.S. Embassy In Kyiv Temporarily Closed Due To Russian Airstrike ...	In a rare move, the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv shut down operations today after officials 'received information about a potential significant air attack on November 20,' the embassy announced. Several other Western embassies followed suit. Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials say the country is being subjected to a large-scale Russian propaganda campaign using 'fake' information about a potential attack to spread fear. 'Out of an abundance of caution, the Embassy will be closed, and Embassy employees are being instructed to shelter in place,' the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv posted on its website Wednesday. 'The U.S. Embassy recommends U.S. citizens be prepared to immediately shelter in the event an air alert is announced.' The announcement did not elaborate on the threat to Kyiv, which is frequently targeted by Russia and had just been hit by another volley of missiles and drones overnight.

We continue to monitor the situation working with our Ukrainian partners.' 'This is a temporary change in posture, and we anticipate a quick return to regular operations,' the embassy told us. 'We recommend all U.S. citizens follow instructions from local authorities regarding air alerts and immediately seek shelter when instructed. The Embassy will continue to provide updates via official U.S. Embassy social media platforms. ' After the U.S. closed its embassy, Greece, Italy, and Spain followed suit. Embassies of the United States, Spain and Italy are closed in Kyiv today due to a possible massive Russian missile attack. pic.twitter.com/2c89yqhDSE&mdash; Anton Gerashchenko (@Gerashchenko_en) November 20, 2024 'The American Embassy has shared information on its website about a possible high-intensity air strike today, November 20,' the Italian embassy posted on its website. 'As a precaution, the Embassy in Kyiv will remain closed to the public today. The Embassy remains operational. In the event of an air raid alert, all Italian citizens present in the country are advised to follow the most stringent risk mitigation measures and immediately go to the nearest shelter.' The closures come amid heightened tensions. On Tuesday, Ukraine used U.S.-made Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles for the first time against a target inside Russia. In response to the Biden administration’s approval of such attacks, a top Russian politician said that his nation could launch a weapon never before used in retaliation. Adding to the concerns, a previously planned reduction in the threshold by which Russia said it would use its nuclear arsenal went into effect on Tuesday. The closure is not related to 'Russia’s announcement that it has lowered the threshold for a nuclear strike,' the embassy added. 'The embassy closure is related to ongoing threats of air attacks. ' Ukrainian officials suggested that the warnings are based on Russian propaganda efforts to sow fear. 'A terrorist country is conducting a massive information and psychological attack against Ukraine,' the Ukrainian Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR) stated on Telegram Wednesday. 'A message about the threat of a ‘particularly massive’ rocket-bomb attack on Ukrainian cities today is being spread through messengers and social networks, allegedly on behalf of the GUR. This message is a fake, it contains grammatical errors typical for Russian information and psychological operations.' GUR urged people to 'trust information only from official resources and from the spokespersons of the Ministry of Education and Culture. The enemy, unable to subjugate Ukrainians by force, resorts to measures of intimidation and psychological pressure on society. Please be vigilant and persistent.' Still, the threat of air strikes remains very real, GUR reminded. 'Do not ignore air raid signals - it is safer to wait in shelter,' GUR explained. 'However, we urge you not to panic.' #гурінформує Країна-терорист проводить масовану інформаційно-психологічну атаку проти України pic.twitter.com/QdgWUwL7Pp&mdash; Defence intelligence of Ukraine (@DI_Ukraine) November 20, 2024 The Russians are using the embassy closings to stoke fear, a top Ukrainian official suggested. 'In terms of information, now they are also trying to shake panicky moods against the background of the closing of embassies,' Andriy Kovalenko, head of Ukraine’s Center for Countering Disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council, said on Telegram Wednesday Ukraine has been well aware that Russia was planning future attacks and stockpiling munitions to hit the nation’s power and heating infrastructure ahead of winter, Kovalenko noted. 'The Russians prepared for shelling in the cold season - this is their tactic,' he posited. 'Rockets were stockpiled, aviation and fleet were being prepared. Bet on cruise missiles and ballistics, as well as drones for the depletion of air defense. These plans are not unexpected, they are known and warned about.' The Russians, he added, 'have different types of missiles in their arsenal. And this is also known.'

(Photo by Ukrinform/NurPhoto via Getty Images) NurPhoto To head off any panic, Kovalenko reminded Ukrainians that they had been through this before. 'After three years of large-scale, as well as now knowing about Russia's presence of missiles and plans to attack Ukraine and infrastructure, Ukrainians already understand the situation - you need to plan your time and prepare safe places for yourself in case of alarm, calculate the route and the time it takes to reach these safe places can be reached,' he offered. 'It is also important to follow official communications, in particular, from the Air Force.' 'As for the panic that they are trying to incite, I will clarify once again that Russia was preparing for shelling and this is part of the war,' Kovalenko said. 'The plans of the Russians are known to the Defense Forces. There is and will be an antidote.' Ukrainian offices are also closing and urging employees to work from home, another sign of how far the fake messaging has spread, argued Maria Drutska, a former Ukrainian defense official now working in the foreign affairs sector.

Conflicts 'Eating Into' Critical Munitions Stockpiles Needed For ...	The U.S. military risks going into a potential major fight with China with insufficient stocks of Patriot surface-to-air interceptors and other key munitions due to obligations in the Middle East and Ukraine, the top officer in the Pacific has warned. America's armed forces need to not only replenish that inventory, but grow it further, to be adequately prepared for a high-end scenario in the Pacific, especially a conflict over Taiwan. U.S. Navy Adm. Samuel Paparo, head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM), talked bluntly about his concerns at an open event the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, D.C., hosted earlier today. Adm. Samuel J. Paparo, commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, speaks at AFCEA’s TechNet Indo-Pacific in Honolulu, Oct. 24, 2024. USN At one point in the discussion Paparo was asked a direct question about whether ongoing fighting in Ukraine and in and around the Middle were impacting U.S. military preparedness in his part of the world. 'Up to this year, where most of the employment of weapons were really artillery pieces and short-range weapons, I had said not at all,' he said. 'But now, with some of the Patriots that have been employed, some of the air-to-air missiles that have been employed, it is now eating into [our] stocks. &#8230; and to say otherwise would be dishonest.' Ukraine has received a number of Patriot surface-to-air missile systems and interceptors to go with them from the U.S. military and other Western partners. Patriots were also among the air and missile defense systems employed in the defense of Israel against Iranian attacks in April. Ukrainian personnel remove camouflage netting from a Patriot launcher. Ukrainian Air Force Ukrainian personnel remove camouflage netting from a Patriot launcher, which is loaded with missile canisters associated with older interceptors like the PAC-2-series. Ukrainian Air Force The U.S. military has supplied a variety of other air and missile defense capabilities to Ukraine since 2022. American forces have also expended significant numbers of surface-to-air and air-to-air munitions in operations to shield friendly warships and commercial shipping in and around the Red Sea from Houthi militants in Yemen, as well as while defending Israel. This includes SM-2, SM-3, and SM-6 ship-launched surface-to-air interceptors and AIM-9X and AIM-120 air-to-air missiles. Ground-based National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS), examples of which have been supplied to Ukraine, can also fire AIM-9Xs and AIM-120s. The US Navy Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Carney fires an SM-2 missile at Houthi threats in October 2023. USN The U.S. Navy's Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Carney fires a missile at a Houthi threat in October 2023. Also visible in the foreground is a Phalanx CIWS. USN A variety of other surface and air-launched munitions have gone to Ukraine and/or have been expended in the course of operations against the Houthis and elsewhere in the Middle East, as well. One prime example of this is supplies of Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) short-range ballistic missiles to Ukrainian forces, which they have just recently gotten American approval to employ against targets inside Russian territory. In the past, Army officials have explicitly cited incoming stocks of new Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) short-range ballistic missiles as helping free up ATACMS for Ukraine. A US Army M270-series launcher fires an ATACMS missile. US Army 'If there are X [munitions in the] inventory of the United States of America, which is fungible across all theaters, that can be applied equally across any contingency, &#8230; none are reserved for any particular theater,' expending them elsewhere 'inherently, it imposes costs on the readiness of America to respond in the Indo-Pacific region,' Adm. Paparo explained. 'The Indo-Pacific region&#8230; is the most stressing theater for the quantity and quality of munitions, because the PRC [People's Republic of China] is the most capable potential adversary in the world,' he continued. 'We should replenish those [munition] stocks and then some. I was already dissatisfied with the magazine depth,' America's top officer in the Pacific, who took up the post in May, added. 'I'm a little more dissatisfied with the magazine depth. You know, it's a time for straight talk.' Paparo is not the first to raise the alarm about what the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East are doing to U.S. munition stockpiles. Navy officials have been especially open about the worrying number of missiles and other weapons that have been expended against Houthi and Iranian threats. Concerns about the adequacy of U.S. stocks of certain munitions also predate these current crises, as the The War Zone has highlighted in the past. An SM-3 missile at the moment of launch. The first combat employment of this anti-ballistic missile interceptor was in April 2024 against Iranian ballistic missiles headed toward Israel. USN An SM-3 anti-ballistic missile interceptor at the moment of launch. USN There have already been growing calls from inside America's armed forces, as well as Congress and elsewhere, to replenish those inventories and grow them beyond their previous size. There is also an emerging consensus that expanding and diversifying the U.S. industrial base available to produce key munitions, as well as developing and fielding lower-cost capabilities that are faster produce, is increasingly critical. The Patriot interceptors and other munitions Paparo alluded to today are not bought off the shelf, are full of high-end and often unique components, and can take months or even years to procure. As indicated by his 'magazine depth' remarks, Paparo is already very outspoken on these issues, especially when it comes to preparing for a potential conflict with China over Taiwan, in the South China Sea, or elsewhere in the Pacific. Paparo has previously discussed efforts to help the Taiwanese defend themselves through the use of hordes of kamikaze drones and other uncrewed platforms in the air, on the waves, and underwater that would turn the battlespace around the island into a 'hellscape' for invaders, as you can read more about here. Speaking today, Paparo stressed his belief that the U.S. military should be working to prepare for a potential fight around Taiwan as soon as possible rather than with an eye toward being ready to do so by 2027. U.S. officials regularly cite past statements by Xi Jinping telling the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to at least be prepared by that year to successfully execute an armed invention against the island. 'The closer we get to it [2027], the less relevant that date is, and the more we must be ready today, tomorrow, next month, next year, and onward,' Paparo said at Brookings. With a new presidential administration on the horizon and concerns about at best flat defense budgets in the coming years, there are many new questions facing the U.S. military when it comes to things like replenishing munitions and its general global posture. Regardless, when it comes to Ukraine, specifically, 'ATACMS may be the last major offensive weapons system left that the U.S. has to take off its shelf and hand to' that country, according to a separate report just today from Politico, which only underscores Paparo's remarks. The current head of INDOPACOM has certainly made clear that he believes that there is a worrisome shortfall of critical munitions, which would be doubly concerning should a high-end fight with China break out.

Army Arsenal Seeking Info On Mysterious Drone Flights Over Instal...	The U.S. Army's Picatinny Arsenal in northern New Jersey is working with local, state, and federal partners to obtain more information about mysterious drone activity over the facility and in the surrounding area, a spokesman told us. His comments were in response to questions we asked about reports of strange drone activity near the facility that emerged on social media overnight. The military installation is home to several important armament development organizations, including the Joint Center of Excellence for Guns and Ammunition, the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command (DEVCOM) Armaments Center, and one of the Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC)'s research and development laboratories. The reported drone activity comes in the wake of a drone incursion over Langley Air Force Base last December that we were the first to report. You can read more about that in our initial story about those incidents here. Langley is just a high-profile example of an increasingly concerning pattern of peculiar drone operations around sensitive facilities. 'We received reports of what were believed to be drones flying over Picatinny Arsenal, in addition to other locations in Morris County&#8230;on the evening of November 18, 2024,' facility spokesman Timothy Rider told us in an email Tuesday afternoon. 'Picatinny Arsenal organizations were not involved in UAV flight operations on that date. We are working with several of our local, state, and federal partner organizations to obtain more information on the reported activity.' One Twitter account claimed that drones flew over Picatinny Arsenal.

Several social media accounts posted video and images Tuesday of lights seen over northern New Jersey they attribute to drones of an unknown origin. However, they are low-quality and it is impossible to discern exactly what was seen and whether they were even drones. 'Unusual activity reported over Morris County, NJ: multiple large drones spotted flying from the Somerset County border northward and back,' the @NJerzyFireAlert Twitter account reported. 'Law enforcement has been advised to notify their communications centers of any sightings.' New Jersey State Police 'aviation is reported to be in the area tracking the drones,' the account, which monitors police and fire activities in the area, added. 'An Army Black Hawk helicopter was also tracked on flight radar in the area. Multiple reports of the drones being spotted in Madison, Morris Township, and Mendham.'

Boris Sanchez with the Dover Police Department, told us that as of Tuesday afternoon, his agency has not received any reports about drones flying in the area last night or early this morning. Meanwhile, about 25 miles to the north, drones are being used in efforts to fight a large forest fire along the New Jersey-New York border. It is unclear what, if any connection, there is between those and what was posted on social media, but that seems unlikely considering the distance involved, unless they were being confused with manned aircraft. Several drones were spotted near the Picatinny Arsenal in northern New Jersey. The facility is about 25 miles from a large forest fire on the New Jersey-New York border. (Google Earth image) 'New York State Police Drones continue to play a vital role in the ongoing battle against the Jennings Creek Wildfire, which has now consumed 5,300 acres along the New York-New Jersey border,' the Drone-XL website reported on Monday. 'The fire, which initially challenged responders with only 10% containment, has now reached 88% containment on the New York side and 90% containment on the New Jersey side, thanks in part to advanced drone surveillance capabilities.' New York State Police Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) pilots 'remain at the forefront of the firefighting operation, using thermal imaging to identify hotspots and guide ground crews, according to Patch. 'This aerial intelligence has proven especially valuable as the fire zone has expanded and conditions have evolved.' Drones operating on the New York side of the fire did not cross into New Jersey, a New York State Police spokesman told us. 'New York State Police is the only agency authorized to operate Unmanned Aerial Systems on the New York State side of the wildfire,' Beau Duffy said. 'We don’t have any evidence that our UAS have crossed into New Jersey.' Nobody has sought information about the New Jersey drone sightings from the New York State Police, Duffy added. The New York State Department of Military and Naval Affairs (DMNA) told us that they were flying UH-60 Black Hawk and CH-47 Chinook helicopters to help fight the fire, but they were not operating drones in that effort. Eli Roberts, who chases storms, captured extensive video of those helicopter flights in operation, which you can see below. We have reached out to several federal, state and local agencies for additional details and will update this story with any pertinent information provided. It remains unclear exactly what people were seeing in the sky last evening over and near Picatinny Arsenal, however, the installation is clearly taking reports of drone activity seriously enough to contact several other partner organizations to find answers. This fits with a major change in how seriously military installations and critical infrastructure facilities are taking these kinds of events. For years they were largely seen as puzzling and action came slow, if at all. Now, with the glaring threat posed by drones of various types and their proliferation in conflicts overseas, as well as the increase in intrusion events at home and abroad, and especially after the events over Langley AFB last winter, they are being looked at with much more concern. This now includes accelerating the deployment of military capabilities to identify and defeat drone systems near these key areas, which you can read about here. We will update you when we find out more details about this incident.

Sabotage Claims Swirl Around Severed Baltic Sea Cable Incidents	Germany says that damage to two communication cables in the Baltic Sea was most likely the result of sabotage. The mysterious incidents, which began on Sunday, are the latest in a series in the region. They come as concerns grow over nefarious Russian activity in Europe, seemingly part of an apparent wave of ‘hybrid warfare’ as the conflict in Ukraine further stokes East-West tensions. Meanwhile, accounts of a Chinese vessel operating in the vicinity of the cables around the time they were damaged raises the possibility that this might have been involved, whether deliberately or otherwise. The two cables in question are both fiber-optic communication cables, running along the Baltic seabed. One of these runs between the Swedish island of Gotland and Lithuania, and the other between Finland and Germany. An infographic shows the approximate locations of the undersea cables that were damaged in the Baltic Sea in the last few days. Photo by Murat Usubali/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu The first of these — some 135 miles long — appears to have been damaged at around 8:00 a.m. GMT on Sunday, according to the telecoms company Telia Lietuva. This led to an outage on internet communications. The second cable is 746 miles long, running between Helsinki and the German port of Rostock. This was put out of action around 2:00 a.m. GMT on Monday, the Finnish cybersecurity and telecoms company Cinia said. A fiber-optic cable is pulled ashore from a German cable-laying ship in the Baltic. The cable seen here, which runs from Scandinavia to the German island of Rügen, also appears at the top of this story. It was not one of those recently damaged but is similarly used for internet communications.

Photo by Laszlo Pinter/picture alliance via Getty Images picture alliance 'No one believes that the cables were accidentally damaged,' Pistorius said. 'I also don’t want to believe that the ships’ anchors caused the damage by accident.' 'We have to assume, without certain information, that the damage is caused by sabotage,' he added.

Meanwhile, the foreign ministers of Finland and Germany have offered more circumspect statements on the incidents, with a joint statement expressing their 'deep concern' and confirmation that a 'thorough investigation' is now underway. The Swedish Navy, too, confirmed today that a criminal investigation is underway in that country, with the navy contributing ships that will pinpoint the locations of the damaged cables.

Full statement by @ElinaValtonen and @ABaerbock: pic.twitter.com/5oM46cFZdb&mdash; GermanForeignOffice (@GermanyDiplo) November 18, 2024 However, this is hardly the first time that there has been suspicious activity in the Baltic Sea, including suspected sabotage. Most notoriously, there was a series of explosions along the Nord Stream gas pipelines in 2022. The cause of these is still being investigated by German authorities. One of the 2022 Nord Stream gas leaks photographed from a Danish F-16 fighter. Danish Armed Forces Outside of the Baltic, there have been other incidents of reported sabotage of critical communications cables, including one associated with Evenes Air Station, in northern Norway, which happened in April, but was only disclosed in August, as TWZ reported at the time. Norway has seen other suspicious incidents in the past, notably the cutting of a vital undersea cable connecting Svalbard to mainland Norway in 2022. While the Baltic Sea has long been of strategic significance for both Russia and NATO and its allies, there has been a spike in incidents in these waters since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Against the backdrop of East-West tensions, suspected sabotage incidents in the Baltic have led to speculation that these may be Russian-inspired, or at least connected to this standoff. 'The fact that such an incident immediately raises suspicions of intentional damage speaks volumes about the volatility of our times,' said Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen and her German counterpart Annalena Baerbock in their joint statement. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock (right) and Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen (left). Photo by Kay Nietfeld/picture alliance via Getty Images picture alliance 'Our European security is not only under threat from Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine but also from hybrid warfare by malicious actors. Safeguarding our shared critical infrastructure is vital to our security and the resilience of our societies.' The foreign ministers stepped back from blaming Russia directly for the latest incidents, but, in a separate statement, Baerbock did draw attention to other reported Kremlin-inspired hostile activity in Europe in recent months. Baerbock noted that Germany has been targeted by cyber-attacks, surveillance of critical infrastructure, and fires as the result of an incendiary device plot, which you can read more about here. Other incidents in Germany this year alone have included an alert at Geilenkirchen Air Base after the German Ministry of Defense reported 'intelligence information indicating a potential threat,' the arrest of two German-Russian nationals on suspicion of plotting sabotage attacks on U.S. military facilities in the country, as well as reports of unexplained drone activity, including over a major floating liquid natural gas (LNG) terminal. 'These can’t all just be coincidences,' the German foreign minister said. E-3A AWACS aircraft at Geilenkirchen in February 2022. In August this year, the facility’s state of alert was raised in response to 'intelligence information indicating a potential threat.' Photo by Marius Becker/picture alliance via Getty Images In the meantime, NATO is stepping up its surveillance activities in the Baltic. In particular, the Latvian Navy has said it will increase its patrols in the areas where the cables were damaged. More broadly, NATO’s Allied Maritime Command (MARCOM) says that it is aware of an increased threat to undersea infrastructure. 'These attacks show how vulnerable such infrastructure can be. NATO is stepping up patrols near undersea infrastructure,' the command said. In the recent past, MARCOM has also highlighted the specific risk that Russia poses to undersea infrastructure. 'We know the Russians have developed a lot of hybrid warfare under the sea to disrupt the European economy through cables, internet cables, pipelines. All of our economy under the sea is under threat,' MARCOM’s deputy commander Vice-Admiral Didier Maleterre said earlier this year. Previously, we’ve looked at how the Russian Navy has a variety of means at its disposal to conduct covert operations on the seabed. It’s widely assumed that Russia’s special mission submarines, deep-sea submersibles, and unmanned underwater vehicles can be used for both investigating and disrupting undersea cables. Certainly, cutting communications cables should be well within the capabilities of such craft. There are also various Russian Navy surface vessels that are ideal for these kinds of activities. Prominent among them is the Yantar, described as an 'oceanographic research vessel,' but frequently used for military purposes, with specialized equipment that can reportedly tap or cut submarine cables and investigate and retrieve objects from depths of up to 18,000 feet. Recently, the Yantar was escorted out of the Irish Sea after it entered Irish-controlled waters and patrolled an area containing critical energy and internet submarine pipelines and cables. The Russian spy ship Yantar. Almaz Design Bureau On the other hand, sabotage of undersea cables could likely also be achieved covertly even without using methods as high-tech as submarines and other underwater vehicles. In shallower water, divers would be able to operate, although they would still require some kind of support vessel, at least in the general vicinity. The security situation in the Baltic is also having a direct effect on infrastructure plans. Most prominently, Sweden decided earlier this month not to build 13 new offshore windfarms, citing the security risks involved. As for the most recent damage to the Baltic communication cables, there has been some speculation that a commercial vessel may have been responsible, by dragging its anchor along the seabed. There would also appear to be a precedent for this. Last year, a subsea gas pipeline and several telecoms cables off the coasts of Finland and Estonia were badly damaged in an incident that was initially suspected of being sabotage. Ultimately, investigators determined that a Chinese container ship likely dragged its anchor had caused the damage. While it’s unclear whether the damage in 2023 was accidental or intentional, it’s possible that the same thing might have happened again in the last few days. Based on publicly available ship-tracking websites, it appears that another Chinese vessel, the Yi Peng 3, may have been in close proximity to both the communication cables around the time that damage was reported. Using the same data, it seems that the cargo ship also slowed down while passing over the cables. pic.twitter.com/KU0zU0Rtu5&mdash; auonsson (@auonsson) November 19, 2024 Strong circumstantial evidence that Chinese-flagged cargo ship Yi Peng was responsible for breaking two underwater telecoms cables in the Baltic Sea (17-18th November).CLion1 connecting Finland and Germany and BSC connecting Sweden and Lithuania severed.Via… pic.twitter.com/3Bknm21RVo&mdash; Navy Lookout (@NavyLookout) November 19, 2024 The same Chinese vessel was later noted being shadowed by the Royal Danish Navy, before heading out of the Baltic. So far, previous incidents involving appare t sabotage to Baltic Sea infrastructure have proven very difficult to pin on any one culprit, despite a spike in reports of Russian-inspired activity in this regard. However, the latest developments underscore the fact that undersea infrastructure is a major vulnerability, something that has been known for years, while the Baltic Sea’s strategic importance is magnified by the standoff between NATO and Russia.

TB3 Drone Lands, Takes Off From Turkey’s ‘Drone Carrier’ Amphibio...	A Bayraktar TB3 uncrewed aircraft has successfully landed on and taken off from the Turkish Navy’s ‘drone carrier’ TCG Anadolu for the first time. TB3s, which can be armed with small precision munitions and conduct surveillance and reconnaissance missions, are set to be a central component of the ship's air wing. Selcuk Bayraktar, Chief Technology Officer at the TB3's manufacturer Baykar, posted videos of the TB3's milestone achievements aboard Anadolu on social media earlier today. Bayraktar had previously posted clips showing one of the drones making approaches and flying over the ship's flight deck, but not actually touching down. Sevda kuşun kanadında..

The TB3 flew for the first time last year and conducted its first land-based ski-jump takeoff test earlier this year. The drone is a navalized variant of the combat-proven TB2, which Ukrainian forces extensively employed in the opening phases of Russia's all-out invasion. TB2s have also seen combat in Syria and Libya, as well as in fighting between Azerbaijan and Armenia. The Anadolu's design is based on that of Spain’s Juan Carlos I amphibious assault ship and it features a large open flight deck with a ski-jump at the bow. The Turkish vessel also has a well-deck at the rear for launching and recovering landing craft, as well as spaces internally for accommodating tanks and other vehicles and ground personnel, to support traditional amphibious operations. The TCG Anadolu. Ozan Guzelce/via Getty Images In 2023, Turkish authorities announced plans to optimize the ship's configuration to support drone operations. Modifications to support that shift in focus would include the addition of dedicated control stations and accompanying beyond-line-of-sight satellite communications terminals, a ‘roller system’ on the flight deck toward the bow to help launch uncrewed aircraft, an arresting gear system, and safety nets. Selcuk Bayraktar's videos do not appear to show the use of any launch or recovery systems on Anadolu as part of the latest TB3 testing, indicating those modifications, at least, are still to come. The TB3 landing on and taking off from Anadolu is still a significant achievement that puts Turkey one step closer to fielding an operational uncrewed naval aviation capability currently found in no other country. With an expected 1,000-mile-maximum range and 24-hour endurance, the drones are set to give the Turkish Navy a completely new way to project maritime power. The TB3s can be fitted with up to six underwing hardpoints capable of carrying small precision-guided missiles and bombs, as well as rockets and other munitions, along with a sensor turret containing electro-optical and infrared cameras underneath the central fuselage. A rendering of TB3 armed with various small precision-guided munitions. Baykar Flying from Anadolu's deck, TB3s could conduct attacks at certain targets on land and at sea, as well as conduct surveillance and reconnaissance missions. The drones could also act as aerial network relay nodes and, if fitted with a radar of some kind, possibly even serve as airborne early warning platforms. Turkey's naval drone ambitions for Anadolu already look to go beyond the TB3. An example of Baykar’s jet-powered fighter-like Kizilelma drone was also loaded onto the ship's flight deck for a ceremony marking its formal entry into service last year, as seen below. Kizilelma reflects a larger trend in increasingly advanced uncrewed aviation developments from the Turkish aviation sector that also includes Turkish Aircraft Industries (TAI) stealthy flying-wing ANKA-3 uncrewed combat air vehicle (UCAV). Serhat Cagdas/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images For Turkey, drones also just offer a valuable domestic pathway to fielding fixed-wing naval aviation capabilities, in general. The Turkish government's ejection from the F-35 program over the country's purchase of Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile systems in 2019 upended any near-term plans to acquire short-takeoff and vertical landing capable B variants for Anadolu. The S-400 deal and other factors led to a broader cooling of U.S.-Turkish relations that ended any discussion about acquisitions of ex-U.S. Marine Corps Harrier jump jets. There has been some talk in the past year about Turkey rejoining the F-35 program. Helicopters, including armed AH-1W Cobra and T129 types and anti-submarine warfare SH-60B Seahawks, are also expected to operate from Anadolu's deck. Turkish officials pose on the flight deck of TCG Anadolu during a ceremony in 2023. A TB3 and Kizilelma drones, as well as AH-1 and SH-60 helicopters, are visible. Murat Kula/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images In addition, the TB3 testing aboard Anadolu is just one example of a still-growing push to field uncrewed naval aviation capabilities globally, as well as adapting big-deck amphibious warfare ships into the 'drone carrier' role. China is making particularly significant strides in this regard, including in the development of flying wing UCAVs that can operate from carriers and other big-deck ships, as well as an entirely new class of super-sized amphibious assault ship. In the United Kingdom, the Royal Navy has shown its ability to launch and recover drones in the same general size class as the TB3, such as General Dynamics Mojave, from its carrier HMS Prince of Wales as part of efforts there to expand uncrewed naval aviation capabilities. Just last week, what General Atomics described as a Gray Eagle STOL drone successfully launched from South Korea's Dokdo amphibious assault ship as part of another demonstration, but recovered at a base on land.

Mark Brinkley (@cmarkbrinkley) November 13, 2024 General Atomics is also pitching a derivative of its MQ-9 Reaper that can operate from big-deck ships, as well as a carrier-capable member of its highly modular Gambit family of uncrewed aircraft. A rendering of a notional catapult-equipped HMS Prince of Wales with an air wing that includes carrier-capable Gambit 5s and MQ-9 Reaper variants. General Atomics A number of other countries are also actively looking to field fixed-wing naval drone capabilities or otherwise exploring doing so, and in many cases by leveraging existing or future big-deck amphibious assault ships. In many ways, the U.S. Navy has been lagging behind in such developments, with the MQ-25 Stingray tanker drone set to be its first operational advanced uncrewed carrier-based aircraft. The MQ-25 will have a secondary surveillance and reconnaissance capability, and there have been discussions about adding additional roles and missiles, including stand-off strike, in the future. The Navy is now in the process of installing new dedicated drone control centers on its carriers, which it says will help it realize its own larger uncrewed naval aviation plans. The service has a stated goal for its carrier air wings to eventually become at least 60 percent pilotless. With the successful demonstration of the TB3's ability to land on and take off from the Anadolu, Turkey still looks in line to be the first to have an operational 'drone carrier.'

U.S.-Supplied ATACMS Missile Strike Inside Russia Have Begun	Ukraine has used the U.S.-made Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) for the first time against a target inside Russia, according to U.S. officials, as well as military sources in Russia and Ukraine. The confirmation comes soon after Moscow warned that the use of Western-supplied long-range missiles by Ukraine against Russia could trigger a nuclear response after Russian nuclear war plans were updated. Early this morning, a large explosion tore through Russia’s 67th GRAU Arsenal, a critical ammunition storage facility in Bryansk Oblast, sending a fireball soaring hundreds of feet in the air.Ukrainian attack drones had been spotted in the area. pic.twitter.com/YhNWDIsqJe&mdash; OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) November 19, 2024 This is allegedly the moment when ATACMS struck the 67th GRAU arsenal near Karachev.

The target is around 70 miles from the Ukrainian border. The ATACMS short-range ballistic missiles can hit targets up to about 190 miles away, while earlier variants feature a shorter range. Videos showed a large fireball rising over the area, as well as the sounds of multiple smaller explosions, with the specific target said to be the 67th Arsenal of the Russian Main Missile and Artillery Directorate (GRAU). The approximate location of Karachev within the Bryansk region of western Russia. Google Earth 'Indeed, this is the first time that ATACMS has been used to strike Russian territory. The strike was carried out on a facility in the Bryansk region, and it was successfully destroyed,' an unnamed Ukrainian military source told Ukrainian news agency RBC-Ukraine. Another Ukrainian official confirmed the use of ATACMS, speaking to the Washington Post on the condition of anonymity. Provided the Karachev depot was the target, this would suggest that indications that Washington had limited the use of ATACMS to Russia’s Kursk region exclusively are erroneous — or otherwise that Ukraine decided to ignore that restriction. On the other hand, the Bryansk region does neighbor it and it’s almost certain that weapons stored in Karachev were being used to directly support the Russian counteroffensive in Kursk. Too good to be true. As always, yesterday’s news that Biden allows Ukraine to use US long-range missiles to hit targets deep in Russia turns out to be too good to be true.

Local authorities also reported a drone attack, according to Astra Press, an independent Russian news outlet on Telegram. A combined operation using ATACMS and one-way attack drones is certainly a possibility. The attack was confirmed by Andriy Kovalenko, the head of Ukraine’s Center for Countering Disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council. In a post on Telegram, Kovalenko said that the facility was used to store artillery ammunition, anti-aircraft missiles, air-to-ground guided weapons, and ammunition for multiple-launch rocket systems. He also said that drones were involved in the attack, apparently arriving ahead of ATACMS. Meanwhile, the Russian Ministry of Defense also claimed that it had found debris from ATACMS missiles close to a military facility in the Bryansk region, further claiming that, from a total of six such missiles fired by Ukraine, five were brought down by Russian air defenses, and the other was damaged. The Russian Ministry of Defense said that a small fire had resulted from the attack but there were no casualties or significant damage. A U.S. Army HIMARS launcher fires an ATACMS missile.

So far, no videos or photos have emerged showing ATACMS fragments in Bryansk, either on social media or from official Russian channels. This is not the first time that this munitions storage facility has come under attack, with at least three such raids having been reported since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine was launched in February 2022. In the past, there were also Ukrainian reports that the depot was being used to store arms delivered to Russia by North Korea.

Today, however, Moscow has said that the use of missiles like ATACMS against Russia could lead to a nuclear response, as part of a newly unveiled nuclear doctrine. Speaking at his regular daily press briefing, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Ukraine’s use of Western-supplied conventional missiles against Russia could be met by Russian use of nuclear weapons — although the kinds of targets were not specified. Peskov said that the Kremlin considers the use of nuclear weapons to be an extreme measure, but that updating the doctrine was a necessary response to the current political situation. The latest nuclear doctrine, which was formally approved by Russian President Vladimir Putin before the U.S. election earlier this month, features an expanded list of criteria that could warrant a nuclear response. They now include 'aggression by any non-nuclear state, but with the participation or support of a nuclear country,' which would appear to be a very direct reference to Ukraine and its Western backers. Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin in Moscow on November 18, 2024. Photo by Vyacheslav PROKOFYEV / POOL / AFP VYACHESLAV PROKOFYEV 'In addition, a nuclear response from Russia is possible in the event of a critical threat to its sovereignty, even with conventional weapons, in the event of an attack on Belarus as a member of the Union State, [or] in the event of a massive launch of military aircraft, cruise missiles, drones, other aircraft and their crossing the Russian border,' the document adds. The updated Russian doctrine document is an astounding read. It is so broad and detailed that one has to wonder what it means. Why not just publish a one-pager declaring: 'The President can authorize the use of nuclear weapons in any scenario deemed necessary.' &mdash; Hans Kristensen (also on Bluesky) (@nukestrat) November 19, 2024 This is not the first time that Russia has issued nuclear threats within the context of the war in Ukraine. It has also undertaken tactical nuclear drills on its own territory and in Belarus. Earlier this year, leaked documents also appeared to indicate that Russia’s threshold for employing tactical nuclear weapons is significantly lower than previously thought. Ammunition storage sites were among the likely ATACMS targets that we identified within Russian borders. This is especially true in the case of the versions of ATACMS with cluster warheads, which deliver hundreds of bomblets over a wide area, although the unitary warhead version would also be ideal for penetrating hardened bunkers in which weapons might be stored. Other likely targets include airfields, logistics nodes, supply lines, equipment storage sites, and large gatherings of troops. Any of these — and more — may well be the next to be hit, while the attack on Karachev suggests that the next Ukrainian ATACMS strikes may well target areas outside of the critical Kursk region.

Already, the presence of these weapons in Ukraine has pushed back Russian airpower and at the same time put many more Russian air defense sites at risk. This same pattern will now be extended into Russia itself. With much uncertainty ahead of Trump’s new presidency and the possibility that U.S. arms deliveries to Ukraine will be significantly reduced, or perhaps cut altogether, Kyiv is very likely to try and make the best use of its limited ATACMS stocks in the next two months.

Extra Collaborative Combat Aircraft Purchases To Give USAF Test U...	A unit charged with exploring how the U.S. Air Force will utilize its future Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) is now set to get actual examples of the drones to experiment with. This comes as the service's CCA plans continue to evolve, now in part in response to serious concerns about budgetary shortfalls on the horizon. Andrew Hunter, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology & Logistics, announced the additional Increment 1 CCA purchases at Defense One’s State of Defense Business event on November 13. The CCA program is currently expected to include at least two iterative development cycles, or increments. Anduril and General Atomics are presently developing separate designs as part of the first increment, both of which are expected to fly for the first time next year. The Air Force expects to kick off a competition for Increment 2 sometime in Fiscal Year 2025, which began on Oct. 1. The CCA program also encompasses a variety of other related work, including on autonomous technologies. A model of Anduril's Increment 1 CCA design, called Fury. Jamie Hunter 'One thing that I recently did was approve some additional CCA purchases to equip the Experimental Operations Unit [EOU] in order to enable that experimentation to happen using real assets,' Hunter said last week, according to Defense One. The Air Force first announced plans for the EOU last year and is now in the process of establishing it at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. The unit is tasked with crafting new tactics, techniques, and procedures for employing CCAs, as well as exploring how those drones will be incorporated into the Air Force's overall force structure and helping to build trust in the autonomy algorithms that will underpin their operations. A model of the design General Atomics’ is working on for Increment 1 of the CCA program. Jamie Hunter Various organizations within the Air Force have already been using a variety of crewed and uncrewed aircraft to help lay the groundwork for the introduction of CCAs, as well as support other advanced drone and autonomy research and development and test and evaluation efforts. This includes the General Atomics XQ-67A Off-Board Sensing Station (OBSS) drone, from which that company's CCA design is derived. In his remarks last week, Assistant Secretary Hunter did not say how many additional CCAs, or what types specifically, the Air Force now plans to purchase for the EOU. Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall and Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin have said in the past that the service intends to acquire between 100 and 150 Increment 1 types, at least. It remains unclear whether or not Anduril and General Atomics designs might both ultimately enter production. 'The additional buy for the Air Force helps ensure that warfighters will have ample opportunity for experimentation to support operational fielding before the end of the decade,' Diem Salmon, Vice President of Air Dominance and Strike at Anduril, did say in a statement in response to Hunter's remarks, per Aviation Week. 'Supplying them with actual CCAs is an important step to that,' C. Mark Brinkley, a General Atomics spokesperson, also told Defense One, referring to the EOU's expected work. 'We’re happy to support them in any way.' Air Force Col. Timothy Helfrich separately disclosed that both Increment 1 CCA designs had passed their critical design review during a panel discussion at the inaugural Airpower Futures Forum hosted by the Air & Space Forces Association's Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies on November 13. Helfrich is currently the Senior Materiel Leader for the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center's Advanced Aircraft Division. Much about how the Air Force plans to field and operate its initial CCAs, and what capabilities mix the drones will need as a result, remains murky. The service has said in the past that it expects Increment 1 types to primarily be 'missile trucks' flying in close coordination with crewed combat jets, at least initially. Electronic warfare and Intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions have also been put forward as possible tasks for the initial tranche of the drones. The video below from Collins Aerospace presents one notional vision for how CCAs might operate together with crewed aircraft, at least initially. 'I think it’s a little too early to say whether or not we’re going to do Increment 1B or 1C. We’ll have to learn as Increment 1 rolls out and as Increment 2 rolls out, but we do expect them to be complementary,' Helfrich said last week, according to Air & Space Forces Magazine. 'I do expect that there will be a time where we have a mixture of Increment 1s and Increment 2s; [and] maybe Increment 3 out there.' In addition, 'no one should think that Increment 2 means ‘Increment 1 plus.’ … That doesn’t mean that Increment 2 has more capability,' he added, per DefenseScoop. 'We’re still looking to figure out whether the right balance — if you’re doing the analysis — is to further bring down the capability to maximize a low cost, or is it that I need to change what the focus is from a missile truck to something else.' 'If we are to continue to add capability and gold plate things, we're going to miss out on our costs and most importantly our schedule targets. And so making some of those tough trades,' he further noted, Defense One reported. 'To say this is good enough and moving on has been a challenge, because we want a lot, but we are making those decisions.' In addition, at least week's panel discussion last week, Col. Helfrich highlighted how CCAs are expected to be transformational and that the questions that need to be answered go well beyond just what the drones will do in a combat context. How and where they will operate from, especially on a day-to-day basis domestically within the United States, where there are significant restrictions on fully uncrewed flight activity, are still major unknowns. Other questions about basing and forward deployment, for combat and non-combat missions, as well as what units they will be assigned to persist. Ensuring artificial intelligence-driven autonomous capabilities work as intended and, perhaps more importantly, that operators trust it, are still major hurdles to be overcome. New CCA tactics, techniques, and procedures will also have to account for equally new training, maintenance, and logistics requirements that will be fundamentally different from those required to support crewed aircraft operations. CCAs may have very short service lives overall compared to traditional crewed aircraft. All of this is exactly why the Air Force is standing up the EOU and is somewhat curious that the original plan for this central experimentation force does not appear to have included assigning it actual CCAs. Much can be done using surrogates and high-fidelity simulations, but the new drones are expected to lead to so many changes that it is hard to see how having at least a handful of real examples would not just be valuable, but essential. Fears about at best flat defense budgets in the coming years and the growing costs of various priority modernization efforts have also emerged as another key factor in the Air Force's still-evolving CCA plans, especially when it comes to Increment 2. Secretary Kendall and others have said that Increment 2's requirements will be directly intertwined with other decisions about how to move forward with the acquisition (or not) of a new sixth-generation crewed stealth combat jet and a Next Generation Air-refueling System (NGAS) family of capabilities that could include a new stealth tanker. The sixth-generation fighter effort, which is currently undergoing a deep review, and the CCA program are both part of the larger Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative. A notional sixth-generation stealth combat jet. Collins Aerospace 'The variable that concerns me most as we go through this analysis and produce a range of alternatives is going to be [the availability of adequate resources.] … to pursue any combination of those new designs,' Kendall said, referring to the NGAD combat jet, CCA drones, and NGAS, in a keynote address at the Airlift/Tanker Association’s (ATA) annual symposium, on November 1. Kendall and other service officials have repeateldy stressed that the Air Force is committed to acquiring a mixture of future capabilities to ensure it will able to dominate in the air combat arena going forward. The service has also repeatedly pushed back on assertions that the CCA program's Increment 1 will produce an experimental rather than operational force. The stated goal is still for the first operational CCAs to begin entering service before the end of the decade. The work of the EOU, together now with an assigned force of CCAs, only looks set to be more critical as the Air Force continues to refine its plans for the drones as part of a larger and still-evolving future air power ecosystem.

Biden ATACMS Decision Spurs Russian Threats, Hope and Derision El...	President-elect Donald Trump’s National Security Advisor nominee criticized the Biden administration for easing restrictions on Ukraine’s use of U.S.-donated Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) short-range ballistic missiles. In a major policy shift, the Biden administration on Sunday said Ukraine is now allowed to use ATACMS, although limited to strikes inside Russia’s Kursk region. That move comes two months before Trump takes office. TWZ readers can get up to speed with the news about Biden's long-range weapons policy shift in our recent report here. Mike Waltz, currently a Florida congressman, also told Fox News that he was not briefed before the policy change became public. 'It's another step up the escalation ladder,' he said about allowing Ukraine to strike targets in Kursk with ATACMS. 'And nobody knows where this is going.' 'North Korea is unleashing ballistic missiles, artillery, now tens of thousands of soldiers' into Ukraine, he continued. 'The administration responds by lifting this restriction. North Korea sends more soldiers. South Korea is now saying it may get engaged. China is buying oil from Iran for pennies on the dollar.

The Biden administration move 'is a tactical development,' Waltz posited. 'President Trump is talking grand strategy here. How do we get both sides to the table to end this war?

'It’s clear that the outgoing administration in Washington intends to take steps to, they’ve said so, to continue to add fuel to the fire and to further provoke the level of tension.' Putin has previously threatened to 'supply weapons of the same type to some regions of the world where they can be used to launch strikes on sensitive facilities of the countries that do it to Russia?' Russian State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin issued an ominous warning. 'On Biden's decision to allow Ukraine to strike deep into our country with U.S. missiles,' he wrote on Telegram. 'If this happens, Russia will be forced to respond. How is a question for the Ministry of Defense. It is possible that new weapons systems will be used, which the Russian Federation has not used on Ukrainian territory.' He did not specify what kind of weapon, though Russia's nuclear arsenal is obviously the most concerning. Regardless, Volodin said that while the ATACMS will 'cause damage&#8230;it will not change the situation on the battlefield. I emphasize this. But it will only worsen the fate of Ukraine and its future. And it will finally destroy Russian-American relations.' State Duma speaker Volodin said that Russia could respond to Western long-range missiles with weapons systems that it has not yet 'used on Ukrainian territory''The use of new weapons systems, which the Russian Federation has not used on the territory of Ukraine, cannot be ruled… pic.twitter.com/dGSoX8XFnD&mdash; NEXTA (@nexta_tv) November 18, 2024 Russian media offered sentiments ranging from 'Biden is moving the world closer to a catastrophe' to 'This is not something out of the blue and invincible,' according to BBC's Russian editor Steve Rosenberg.

He has repeatedly urged member states, in particular Germany, a leading military donor, to lift these restrictions. However, his attempts to craft an EU-wide position have gone unheaded, leaving each country to act unilaterally. 'You know my position,' Borrell told reporters on Monday. 'Ukraine should be able to use the arms we provide to them not only to stop the arrows but also to hit the archers. I continue believing this has to be done.' EU’s Josep Borrell: 'Ukraine should be allowed to strike inside Russia with EU-supplied arms. It’s not just about stopping the arrows but hitting the archers.' He expressed hope that EU members will support this during upcoming discussions. NOELREPORTS (@NOELreports) November 18, 2024 A since-revised story in the French Le Figaro media outlet on Sunday claimed that both France and Britain signed off on the use of their long-range weapons in Russia. That claim no longer appears. On Monday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot neither confirmed nor denied whether Ukraine had been granted permission to use SCALP-EG air-launched cruise missiles for strikes deep into Russian territory. Speaking to journalists ahead of a European Union ministers meeting in Brussels on Monday, Barrot referenced France’s previous stance on relaxing restrictions, according to Reuters. 'We openly said this was an option that we would consider if it was to allow to strike a target from where Russia is currently aggressing Ukrainian territory. So nothing new on the other side,' Barrot said. The U.K. has yet to allow Ukraine to use its similar Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missiles inside Russia, the BBC reported. Meanwhile, a former high-ranking Ukrainian official criticized the Biden administration for limiting the use of ATACMS to Russia's Kursk region. 'I think the weakness of the Biden administration in facing up to Putin is the key reason why we are entering the third year of war,' tweeted Tymofiy Mylovanov, Ukraine's former Minister of Economics. 'Ukrainians could have stopped Putin in 2022 had Biden not hesitated to provide weapons and allow strikes he is only now authorizing.' Too good to be true.

'The Military Industrial Complex seems to want to make sure they get World War 3 going before my father has a chance to create peace and save lives,' he tweeted. 'Gotta lock in those $Trillions. Life be damned!!! Imbeciles!' The Military Industrial Complex seems to want to make sure they get World War 3 going before my father has a chance to create peace and save lives. Gotta lock in those $Trillions. Life be damned!!! Imbeciles! Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) November 17, 2024 Allowing Ukraine to use ATACMS in Kursk is the latest in a series of iterative steps the Biden administration has taken when it comes to the use of long-range weapons on Russian soil. Back in May, Biden allowed Ukraine to use M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, with a range of about 50 miles, against targets inside Russia bordering Kharkiv Oblast. It was in response to a Russian counteroffensive in that area. Ukraine has also been using U.S.-donated Joint Direct Attack Munition-Extended Range (JDAM-ER) and Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) precision-guided bombs, as well as French-donated AASM-250 Hammer rocket-assisted bombs in Kursk. As we noted yesterday, Biden's ATACMS decision was a response to the presence of North Korean troops in Kursk to help Russia push Ukraine out of its three-month-old salient there. Holding on to Kursk is also critical, especially now, as it is seen as a key bargaining chip. With the new administration taking its own approach to the war, an attempt to negotiate a deal is now rapidly approaching on the horizon. Losing Kursk now would mean Ukraine's haggling position would be significantly weaker. One fear is that Putin will lash out regardless. The policy shift 'runs the risk of triggering a sharp increase in retaliatory sabotage, such as cyber and arson attacks on Britain and its European NATO partners,' The Guardian argued. The Latest On the battlefield, Russian troops are continuing to advance near two key cities in eastern Ukraine, but are making little progress in taking back territory in its Kursk region. In particular, Russian troops are pressing toward Kupiansk, a logistics hub along the Oskil River in Kharkiv Oblast as well as Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast. However, as the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) argues, Ukraine’s continued defense of Pokrovsk bodes well for the future. 'Russian forces have not taken Pokrovsk after eight months of grinding but consistent advances in western Donetsk Oblast. Ukrainian defensive operations, based on the integration of successful Ukrainian drone innovators and operators with ground forces combined with constraints on Russia's strategic and operational-level manpower and materiel reserves have forced the Russian military command to abandon its original campaign design of a frontal assault on Pokrovsk,' ISW suggested. 'Ukraine’s ability to stave off the seizure of Pokrovsk thus far and force the Russian military to divert its efforts to advances in arguably the least operationally significant sector of the frontline is a positive indicator of Ukraine’s ability to continue fighting this war despite the challenges Ukraine faces and the setbacks it has suffered.'

The commanders 'lied about the success of the assaults on Malaya Lokhnya and the frontline changes, which led to catastrophic results for the next stage of their planned operation,' the news outlet claimed. 'This false narrative led to a complete lack of situational awareness on the battlefield. In reality, the Russians did not control these settlements.' Instead, '100 Russian soldiers from the broken units were actually encircled with no chance to break out,' Euromaidan Press continued. 'In an attempt to secretly salvage the situation and align with the reports submitted to higher command, Russian commanders ordered repeated waves of assaults.' The War Zone cannot independently verify these claims.

'This is the first recorded case of such a symbiosis of a modern cruise missile of the Russian Federation and an outdated Soviet engine,' Colonel of the General Staff claimed. 'Given that the Russian Federation does not manufacture them, there is a possibility that they are taken from old Soviet stocks or the remnants of Kh-55, Kh-55SM cruise missiles are disassembled.' The production of subsonic rocket engines in the Russian Federation 'can be a kind of bottleneck (weak spot) in the entire chain of rocket production, and be a restraining factor in the continued increase in production volumes,' the Telegram channel postulated. 'Previously, the R-95-300 engines, in addition to its native Kh-55(SM) cruise missile, were also seen in almost all discovered Kh-59 guided air missiles.' Some Russian Kh-101 cruise missiles in recent strikes used old Soviet R-95-300 engines instead of standard Russian TRDD-50A engines.These engines are no longer manufactured, and must have been old Soviet stocks or scavenged from disassembled Kh-55/55SM cruise missiles. pic.twitter.com/aKWFfZJwlB&mdash; Roy (@GrandpaRoy2) November 18, 2024 The U.K. Defense Intelligence directorate said two Russian Gepard-class frigates, Tatarstan and Dagestan, were damaged in a Ukrainian drone attack on the port of Kaspiysk on November 6.

The plant at Russia’s Alabuga Special Economic Zone 'recently started churning out thermobaric drones alongside the decoys,' the investigation found. Also known as a fuel-air explosive (FAE) weapon, it is in the same class as certain U.S. weapons, like the AGM-114N Hellfire missile, with a special ‘augmented’ warhead, or the BLU-118/B that was used against cave complexes in Afghanistan. Essentially, this type of weapon works in two stages, using a fuel mixture scattered as as an aerosol cloud and an ignition detonation a to ignite the cloud. It generates a high-temperature explosion that generates a much more powerful blast wave over a longer duration than a conventional condensed explosive. It can kill people in gruesome ways even if they are located inside buildings, caves, and bunkers. 'Russia came up with the plan for decoys in late 2022 and codenamed it Operation False Target,' a person familiar with Russia’s drone production told AP. 'The idea was to launch armed drones along with dozens of decoys, sometimes stuffed with rags or foam, and indistinguishable on radar from those carrying real bombs,' the wire service stated. 'Ukrainian forces must make split-second decisions about how to expend scarce resources to save lives and preserve critical infrastructure.' Last week, we noted that Russia is using its Gerbera drones as decoys in Shahed-136 attack waves to fool Ukrainian air defense and force it to expend interceptors.

Research on Gerbera drones that have been shot down 'proved that the Russians make them according to the Chinese prototype using foreign components imported from China,' GUR claimed on its Telegram channel. The drone is made by the Chinese model aircraft manufacturer Skywalker Technology Co., Ltd., which also produces fuselages and organizes the delivery of kits to Russia,' GUR added. 'Delivery is carried out through third-party companies.' In addition, the barrage versions of the UAV are guided to targets by an operator similar to the way first-person view drones work, GUR stated. The Gerbera is equipped with 'a Chinese camera with a three-axis suspension Topotek KHY10S90 and a Xingkai Tech Mesh Network XK-F358 modem.' It’s powered by 'a DLE60 engine - manufactured by the Chinese Mile Hao Xiang Technology Co, Ltd,' GUR added. 'In the summer of 2024, this company came under US sanctions for supplies to Russia.' According to GUR’s War Sanctions database of Russian weapons containing foreign components, there are 29 in the Gerbera drones. Earlier this month, we reported that (GUR) claimed it found dozens of Western-made components in the Russian S-70 Okhotnik-B (Hunter-B) flying wing unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) downed last month in a case of friendly fire.

F-4 Phantoms Tear Through Turkey To Mark 50 Years Of Service	Turkey has celebrated half a century of operations with the legendary F-4E Phantom fighter, with a spectacular event showcasing close-quarters fly-bys, as well as an ‘elephant walk’ at the type’s last main operating base in the country. While the days of the Turkish ‘Rhino’ have been numbered for some time, the turbulent nature of the country’s fighter force means the jets have shown remarkable longevity and are still important frontline assets. The 50th-anniversary event for the Turkish Air Force F-4E took place over the weekend at Eskişehir in northwestern Turkey, where the local air base is home to the service’s squadron flying the Phantom — 111 Filo 'Panter.' The occasion was marked in a suitable style for such a charismatic jet — and one that is no stranger to very low-level flying around the Anatolian region. F-4E Phantoms take part in a training flight to commemorate 50 years of service in the Turkish Air Force in Eskişehir on November 15, 2024.

The upper sides of the jet carry a huge Turkish flag, while the belly is painted with the famous 'Spook' character found across the global Phantom community ever since it first appeared in the late 1950s. Most dramatically, on Saturday 16th, the anniversary jet and at least one other standard-painted F-4E performed high- and low-speed passes down a river valley, roughly a two-and-a-half-hour drive from the base. This provided gathered photographers and eyewitnesses with a never-to-be-forgotten experience that showcased the raw power of this classic Cold War jet.

On the afternoon of Sunday 17th, the anniversary jet got airborne from Eskişehir as part of a four-ship, making several fly-pasts over the base. In the meantime, another six F-4Es taxied from various hardened aircraft shelters to the other end of the runway. When the four-ship landed, they all formed up on the ground to perform an elephant walk — an airpower exercise designed to demonstrate the readiness of large numbers of aircraft, typically in anticipation of a major contingency, but also for commemorative purposes.

Photo by Ali Atmaca/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu Photo by Ali Atmaca/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu The story of the F-4E with the Turkish Air Force, or Türk Hava Kuvvetleri, dates back to June 1974, when the first of an initial batch of 40 of the jets began to arrive in the country, ordered under the Peace Diamond I program. The deliveries were interrupted by an arms embargo imposed after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in the same year. A follow-on order in 1977 comprised 32 more F-4Es and eight RF-4Es for reconnaissance duties, although the last of the Turkish ‘Recce Rhinos’ were retired in 2015. Several more batches of former U.S. Air Force F-4Es were also obtained, with a total of 233 Phantoms of both versions eventually going onto the Turkish Air Force’s books. Such was the F-4’s popularity that examples were still being accepted in the early 1990s, by which time the more advanced F-16 was well established in service.

The upgraded avionics include an Elta EL/M-2032 multi-mode radar, digital glass cockpit, wide-angle head-up display (HUD), and hands on throttle and stick (HOTAS) controls. The Terminator’s armory is also notably expanded, with weapons now including the Israeli-made Popeye standoff missile, as well as the indigenous Roketsan SOM for use against land and sea targets. Other stores include the HGK 500-pound INS/GPS-guided bomb, KGK 500-pound or 1,000-pound glide bomb, and the LGK-82 — an indigenous version of the 500-pound GBU-12 laser-guided bomb. Photo by Ali Atmaca/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu Photo by Ali Atmaca/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu The name of the Terminator 2020 indicated that it was expected to remain in service until around 2020, but fate has determined that the Turkish F-4E should serve a while longer. Today, Turkey — with a fleet reportedly numbering between 30 and 40 aircraft — is one of the last three operators of the type, the others being its regional rival Greece and Iran. At one point, it was expected that the F-4E would be replaced by F-35A stealth fighters. However, when Ankara decided to buy Russian-made S-400 air defense systems it was kicked out of the Joint Strike Fighter program, and the Phantom’s obvious successor was gone. Photo by Ali Atmaca/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu Photo by Ali Atmaca/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu As of now, it’s conceivable that the Turkish F-4Es might remain active until around 2030, at which point they could be replaced by the TF Kaan next-generation fighter. At the same time, there remain questions about the viability of this project, especially when it comes to sourcing engines and, even if it all goes to plan, the Kaan won’t begin to enter service until 2030, at the earliest. With this situation very likely in mind, Ankara has meanwhile also made efforts to acquire interim equipment, which would likely also displace the F-4Es. Earlier this year, U.S. President Joe Biden signaled that he wanted lawmakers to approve the sale of additional F-16s to Turkey 'without delay.' Soon after, the U.S. State Department approved a possible Foreign Military Sale to Turkey of 40 new F-16C/D Block 70 fighters, plus the upgrade of 79 existing aircraft to F-16V configuration. Turkey already operates an enormous F-16 fleet but efforts to acquire more had long been stalled. That also prompted Ankara to look elsewhere, including potentially buying Eurofighter Typhoons. More recently, there have even been suggestions that the F-35 could be back on the table for Turkey, although only if it agrees to give up its controversial S-400s once and for all. To date, however, no deal has been signed for additional F-16s or Typhoons, meaning that Turkish skies will continue to reverberate to the sound of F-4s for some time to come.

UK’s New SPEAR 3 Mini Cruise Missile Succeeds In First End-To-End...	The SPEAR 3, a precision-guided standoff munition that the U.K. Ministry of Defense describes as the 'cruise missile of the future,' has been test-fired, paving the way for it to arm British F-35B stealth fighters, as well as Typhoon multirole combat aircraft. While offering several key advantages over certain other comparable weapons, the SPEAR 3 program has been mired in delays for some time now, not all of which are the result of problems directly related to the missile. In the meantime, it’s now badly needed, with British F-35Bs having no standoff air-to-ground weapon for the time being. As we have discussed before, the SPEAR 3 is essentially a miniature cruise missile, powered by a small Pratt & Whitney TJ-150-3 turbojet engine. Combined with pop-out wings, this allows it to hit targets at a reported range of more than 62 miles, flying at a high subsonic speed. Other accounts have attributed it with a range of more than 87 miles. Armed with the SPEAR 3 test round, the Typhoon heads toward the Vidsel range in Sweden. Crown Copyright The missile uses a tri-mode seeker which offers radar, infrared, and laser homing. The SPEAR 3 can autonomously identify and prosecute targets or target coordinates can be sent to the missile via datalink, exploiting the launch platform’s sensors or those of third parties. It can be used against mobile and relocatable targets, as well as ones that are more heavily defended, or otherwise challenging to prosecute. When striking its target via laser seeker — especially useful for moving targets — guidance can be provided by an aircraft overhead or by a suitably equipped team of soldiers on the ground nearby. Typical targets include ships, tanks, defended structures, and moving vehicles and it’s especially relevant for destruction of enemy air defense (SEAD) missions, which involve attacking hostile air defense systems. An artist’s impression of the SPEAR 3 in flight. MBDA The U.K. Ministry of Defense announced yesterday that the SPEAR 3 munition — developed by the pan-European missile house MBDA — had completed a recent firing campaign, which saw it launched from a Typhoon FGR4 from 41 Test and Evaluation Squadron. The trials were conducted at the Vidsel range in northern Sweden, within the Arctic Circle, reportedly in mid-October. While this was the first time that the SPEAR 3 was launched against an actual test target, the weapon wasn’t fitted with a warhead. Instead, it carried a telemetry unit, which gathered data on the mock engagement, which involved a 'high-altitude and high-speed release' before zeroing in on a decommissioned tank. The SPEAR 3 is a steep terminal trajectory before striking a main battle tank target at the Vidsel range. MBDA The Swedish test was billed as the 'first successful guided firing trial of the missile,' although it’s worth noting that, as long ago as 2016, a prototype version of the SPEAR 3 was launched at Aberporth in Wales, also from a Typhoon. A spokesperson for MBDA explained how the two tests differed, with the Videl campaign being the first guided firing of the SPEAR 3, as part of the formal qualification — a key step toward declaring the weapon operational. 'The trial demonstrated the end-to-end function and performance of the system from initialization, launch, and transition to free flight, the conduct of pre-programmed maneuvers, and engagement of a target,' the spokesperson added. 'This guided firing was conducted using a SPEAR three-pack launcher, which uses the same sub-systems (including the pneumatic ejection system) as the four-pack launcher for F-35.' In contrast, the 2016 trial served as 'a technology demonstration conducted during the project’s assessment phase, testing the missile’s airframe, navigation, and propulsion systems to increase technical maturity and de-risk the program ahead of the launch of the weapon development phase. The missile was a prototype standard and there was no target selection and engagement functionality in the 2016 trial.'

Crown Copyright In addition, for the 2016 trial, the missile was launched directly from the aircraft’s pylon rather than a dedicated launcher, and the prototype missile was suitably modified to use the existing pylon interface. Returning to the Vidsel trial, U.K. Minister for the Armed Forces, Luke Pollard, issued the following statement: 'The successful trial of the pioneering SPEAR missile marks a significant leap forward in UK Armed Forces’ capabilities, ensuring our Royal Navy and Royal Air Force personnel are equipped with cutting-edge technology to protect our nation.' Another view of the SPEAR 3-armed Typhoon during the test mission at Vidsel. Crown Copyright Matthew Brown, SPEAR Team Leader at the Defense Equipment and Support (DE&S) branch, which handles procurement for the U.K. Ministry of Defense, added: 'This trial was a key step on the way to delivering SPEAR to the UK front line, where it will provide a new capability to defeat the most complex air defense systems, enabling pilots to fly and fight wherever they’re needed in defense of the U.K. and its allies.' As for the next phases of testing, the same MBDA spokesperson confirmed to TWZ that the telemetry and flight termination sub-system fitted in place of a warhead for the Vidsel trial is sufficient to gather all data needed to support system development and model validation, as part of the guided firing program. Meanwhile, the multi-mode warhead, arming, and fuzing systems have already successfully been trialed at the system and sub-system levels. The Typhoon test ship is seen from the cockpit of a Saab Gripen chase plane. Crown Copyright Next up, there will be full test firings using a live warhead, to be conducted by the U.K. Royal Air Force as part of the end-user’s service evaluation trials, although no date for this was given. In the past, we have compared the British-made weapon with the U.S. GBU-53/B Small Diameter Bomb II, better known as StormBreaker, with the major difference being the turbojet engine in the SPEAR 3, which means it has more range and can reach its targets faster than the unpowered glide bomb. Its speed also lends itself to survivability. An artist’s impression of the GBU-53/B Small Diameter Bomb II, or StormBreaker. Raytheon As well as the Typhoon — which already carries the Brimstone precision-guided munition from which the SPEAR 3 was derived — the new missile will arm the U.K.’s fleet of F-35B short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) stealth fighters. These also deploy aboard the U.K. Royal Navy’s two Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers. Each F-35B jet will be able to carry up to eight SPEAR 3 missiles at a time, as well as a pair of Meteor or AIM-120 AMRAAM beyond-visual-range air-to-air missiles (BVRAAMs) — all of them accommodated internally, preserving the jet’s low-observable characteristics. At one time, consideration was also being given to adding capacity for underwing launchers on the F-35B, for a maximum of 16 SPEAR 3 missiles. An artist’s impression of an F-35B armed with SPEAR 3 and Meteor. MBDA While SPEAR stands for Selective Precision Effects At Range, the ‘3’ in the designation of the new missile refers to its place within a portfolio of different air-to-ground weapons that are being developed for the U.K. Armed Forces. Within this structure, SPEAR 1 refers to the Paveway IV precision-guided munition, while SPEAR 2 is the Brimstone, SPEAR 4 is a midlife upgrade for the Storm Shadow cruise missile, and SPEAR 5 is the Future Cruise/Anti-Ship Weapon, which is being pursued as a joint project by the United Kingdom and France. An infographic showing future U.K. F-35 weapons, (1) ASRAAM, currently carried; (2) Meteor; (3) SPEAR 3. All of these cam be carried simultaneously. MBDA In total, the United Kingdom is investing around $8.2 billion in missile programs via the manufacturer MBDA, which is responsible for the SPEAR 3 as well as Brimstone and Storm Shadow, the Sea Venom anti-ship missile, and the CAMM and Sea Viper naval air defense missiles. While the investment is considerable, it should be recalled that the development of the SPEAR 3 has not been free of problems. In 2021, MBDA and BAE Systems announced they had secured funding from the British and Italian governments to complete the integration of the SPEAR 3 on both the F-35B and the conventional takeoff and landing F-35A. While the United Kingdom has only acquired the F-35B, Italy operates both versions. The Typhoon test and evaluation launches in Sweden, carrying a single SPEAR 3 missile. The missile is carried in an inverted carriage position, righting itself after launch, and then deploying its wings. Crown Copyright Chris Ryding At one point, integration of the SPEAR 3 and Meteor on the F-35B was expected by the 'middle of this decade,' while a date of 2027 at the earliest was given in a government report dated February 2022. Earlier this year, the U.K. government said that integration of the SPEAR 3 and Meteor on the F-35B would be completed by the 'end of the decade.' This leaves the British F-35B without a standoff air-to-ground weapon in the meantime, with only the unpowered Paveway IV available. Paveway IV precision-guided bombs prepared for carriage by F-35Bs aboard HMS Queen Elizabeth during a live firing exercise. Crown Copyright The SPEAR 3 program has also been dogged by delays in integrating new weapons on the F-35B. Above all, compatibility with the SPEAR 3 relies upon the F-35 having the Block 4 upgrade, which promises to bring other major advances to the aircraft, including a new multifunction active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar designated as AN/APG-85 and advanced electronic warfare capabilities. Block 4 relies upon a new suite of hardware and software for the F-35, known as Technology Refresh-3 (TR-3), something that has been described as the stealth fighter’s new ‘computer backbone,’ but which has also had a very protracted development. Delays with TR-3 left F-35s being parked and not delivered after they were built, a situation that continued for around a year before deliveries restarted. Those previous jets left waiting at the manufacturing facility also now need to be retrofitted with TR-3. As far as we know, the United Kingdom also plans to bring earlier F-35Bs up to Block 4 standard, to ensure commonality, although there remain questions about just how feasible this is. British F-35Bs lined up on HMS Prince of Wales at the end of Exercise Strike Warrior earlier this year. Crown Copyright AS1 Amber Mayall RAF Against this backdrop, there are also lingering questions about the number of F-35Bs the United Kingdom will buy. While the U.K. Ministry of Defense has long said it’s committed to buying 138 F-35Bs, repeated budgetary concerns mean that this figure is now widely viewed as being unrealistic. As it stands the United Kingdom has ordered 48 F-35Bs, known as Tranche 1, and has confirmed plans to place a Tranche 2 order for 27 F-35Bs, although this is yet to be signed off. Whatever the future F-35B fleet looks like, the SPEAR 3 looks set to provide a very valuable capability and one that will be shared by the Typhoon. Further sales appear likely, with Italy committed to the program, and compatibility with the Typhoon and F-35A/B opens up a potentially wide range of additional export customers. As well as the SPEAR 3, MBDA is also developing the SPEAR-EW, with the explosive payload replaced by an electronic warfare jammer and decoy functions. Ultimately, the aim is for the SPEAR 3 and SPEAR-EW to work together to overwhelm enemy air defenses and protect friendly aircraft and even other missiles. The possibility of harnessing the capabilities of these effectors in a fully networked fashion is significant and TWZ has previously looked more deeply at the implications of these kinds of swarms of mini-cruise missiles. An artist’s impression of the SPEAR-EW in flight. MBDA A spokesperson for MBDA confirmed to TWZ that work on the SPEAR-EW is currently ongoing under a rapid design phase contract from the U.K. Ministry of Defense. Although it has been subject to delays, some of which are attributable to problems in the F-35 program, the SPEAR 3 is now finally making tangible progress on the path toward operational service with the United Kingdom. Once it arrives, it should provide a powerful new capability — especially when combined with the stealthy F-35.

First Stand-In Attack Missile Delivered To USAF	Flight testing of the U.S. Air Force's Stand-In Attack Weapon (SiAW) missile is now set to begin following the delivery of an initial test article. Derived from the AGM-88G missile designed primarily to punch holes in enemy air defenses, SiAW is under development to offer a broader high-speed strike capability against time-sensitive ground targets, including ballistic and cruise missile launchers, air and missile defense nodes, electronic warfare systems, and even anti-satellite weapons. Northrop Grumman, the prime contractor for the AGM-88G and SiAW, released a brief statement about the delivery of the new test missile, 'which is designed to verify that the launch aircraft can safely carry and separate the weapon,' along with a picture of it, seen at the top of this story, today. The company received its latest SiAW contract, valued at approximately $705 million, in September 2023. The U.S. Navy has already been leading the very active development of the AGM-88G, also known as the Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile-Extended Range (AARGM-ER), for years now. The first AARGM-ER live-fire flight test occurred in 2021. A US Navy F/A-18F Super Hornet launches an AGM-88G AARGM-ER during a test. Northrop Grumman Specific details about range, speed, and other capabilities of the SiAW, as well as AGM-88G, remain limited. It is worth noting that Lockheed Martin unveiled a hypersonic missile called Mako, which it said was originally developed for the SiAW competition, earlier this year. We don't know whether or not this means that SiAW (and by extension the AARGM-ER) might then also be capable of reaching hypersonic or near-hypersonic speeds, including in a terminal stage sprint. Lockheed Martin, as well as L3Harris, withdrew from the running for continued work on SiAW before Northrop Grumman received its contract last year. It is also known that AARGM-ER, at least in its baseline configuration, shares the same guidance and flight control systems as the preceding combat-proven AGM-88E AARGM. As such, as The War Zone has written previously: 'AARGM-ER contains a multi-mode guidance package containing a GPS-assisted inertial navigation system, as well as a millimeter-wave radar that can locate targets even if they stop emitting radiofrequency or other signals or even begin to move. The missile’s guidance and datalink package also have the capability to network with off-board sources, meaning a launching aircraft can fire the weapon without even having acquired a target’s emissions, instead relying on other platforms’ data to target and prosecute an attack. The anti-radiation missile can also reportedly relay data in its final moments to confirm whether or not it successfully struck its intended target.' A Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) briefing slide detailing changes and commonalities between the AGM-88G and the AGM-88E. USN A Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) briefing slide showing what is new on the AGM-88G and what is common with the older AGM-88E. USN With the multiple guidance mode options, AARGM and AARGM-ER also already have a secondary general air-to-surface strike capability, including against ships and targets ashore. How exactly SiAW will differ from AARGM-ER, which the Air Force is also acquiring, to provide expanded capability against a broader array of target sets is unclear, but official budget documents explicitly mention an 'improved warhead/fuze.' 'The Stand-in Attack Weapon (SiAW) system will provide capability to strike rapidly re-locatable targets that create the Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) environment,' the Air Force's 2025 Fiscal Year budget request, released back in March, also says. 'SiAW targets include Theater Ballistic Missile Launchers, Land Attack and Anti-Ship Cruise Missile Launchers, Jammers, Anti-Satellite Systems, and Integrated Air Defense Systems.' SiAW, as described now, offers a capability that is particularly relevant to the U.S. military's current over-arching planning focus around a potential high-end conflict with China. The Chinese People's Liberation Army has already made considerable investments in the development and fielding of more advanced and longer-range air defense, anti-ship, and electronic warfare capabilities, as well as ones intended to challenge America's historic dominance in the space domain. Having multiple ways to suppress and destroy these A2/AD capabilities, and do so quickly and effectively across a broad front, will be critical to succeeding in any future major fight in the Pacific region. With all this in mind, it is not surprising that the Air Force plans for its F-35A stealth fighters to be the first aircraft in inventory to be armed with SiAWs. F-35As will also be able to carry the missiles in their internal bays, allowing them to employ this new capability while in their most stealthy configuration. F-35As and Cs will also be able to carry AARGM-ER internally. A picture showing a fit check of the AARGM-ER design in the internal bay of an F-35A or C variant. Orbital ATK www.twz.com The Air Force has also said that the goal is for SiAW to be part of the arsenal of other unspecified 'Future Advanced Aircraft.' The service has been working toward acquiring a new sixth-generation crewed stealth combat jet as part of its Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative, but the future of that effort is now very uncertain, as you can read more about here. The B-21 Raider stealth bomber and various different drones might also be SiAW launch platforms. SiAW, as well as AARGM-ER, could also offer non-stealthy platforms a useful tool for engaging air defense and other targets that might suddenly pop up. Depending on the weapon's range, it might be possible to employ it from beyond the reach of certain threats using third-party targeting data. Other branches of the U.S. military, as well as foreign allies and partners (a number of which are already moving to buy AARGM-ERs), could be interested in SiAW, as well. Northrop Grumman has also been working on surface-to-surface strike derivatives of the AARGM-ER/SiAW family, which could be fired from ground-based launchers or ships. A rendering of the Advanced Reactive Strike (ARES) missile, a proposed ground-launched derivative of the AARGM-ER/SiAW family. Northrop Grumman As it stands now, the Air Force's SiAW testing plan, which is benefitting greatly from the work already done on AARGM-ER, includes at least four live-fire flights. After that, Northrop Grumman says the goal is for the service to take 'delivery of SiAW leave-behind prototype missiles and test assets' to support continued development and work toward operational fielding. The service hopes to reach initial operational capability with the missile sometime in 2026. The delivery of the new SiAW asset is another important step forward in the ongoing development of what could be a particularly critical component of the Air Force's future arsenal.

Ukraine Now Allowed To Use Long-Range Missiles Deep Into Russia: ...	In a major policy shift with two months left in office, the Biden administration will allow Ukraine to use U.S.-produced and donated Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) short-range ballistic missiles deep inside Russia. The missiles, which can hit targets of up to about 190 miles away, are likely to first be used in Russia’s Kursk region, according to The New York Times, citing U.S. officials. The publication was the first to report the administration's change of heart. The policy change was spurred by the presence of North Korean troops fighting in Kursk, the officials said. Ukrainian Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine's Defense Intelligence Directorate, told us on Sunday that there are 12,000 North Korean troops now in Kursk. Pyongyang could eventually send 100,000 troops to Russia, Bloomberg reported on Sunday. The long-range weapons Biden has approved are likely to be initially fired against Russian and North Korean troops in defense of Ukrainian forces in the Kursk region of western Russia w/Adam Entous & @julianbarnes Eric Schmitt (@EricSchmittNYT) November 17, 2024 Russia has sent about 50,000 troops, including North Koreans, into Kursk to take back territory lost during Ukraine’s three-month-old invasion. It marks the second attempt by Russia to push Ukraine out of Kursk. So far, it appears the Russians have been suffering large losses of personnel and equipment without having cut too deeply into Ukraine's Kursk salient. Likely targets for Ukraine include logistics nodes, supply lines, ammunition storage and equipment storage sites and large gatherings of troops, adding additional stresses on Russia's attempts to dislodge Ukraine before Donald Trump takes office in Janurary. You can see some potential targets in the following map. U.S. to allow Ukraine to use long-range weapons inside Russia, NYT reports. This could be a game-changer for Ukraine, which would allow them to challenge Russian logistics supply lines and air dominance.Below is a map of potential targets from ISW pic.twitter.com/wF23YHm87l&mdash; Jane Lytvynenko (@JaneLytv) November 17, 2024 'First and foremost it is strategic deterrence conventional weapon in current circumstances,' a former high-ranking Ukrainian officer told us on Sunday. 'Secondly, we should be allowed to hit high-priority targets far away from the Ukrainian border. As for now, I would focus not only on military targets but also on military industry objects, gas stations, electrical grids etc. Our strategy will depend on how many and what range ATACMS we get.' Throughout the all-out war, the Biden administration has been cautious about allowing the use of U.S.-supplied weapons in Russia, fearing a backlash by Vladimir Putin, who controls a nuclear-armed military. However, there have been changes in that policy in the past. Back in May, Biden allowed Ukraine to use M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, with a range of about 50 miles, against targets inside Russia bordering Kharkiv Oblast. It was in response to a Russian counteroffensive in that area. However, the use of ATACMS was prohibited. Ukraine has been using both weapons to devastating effect inside its own borders. Ukraine has also been using U.S.-donated Joint Direct Attack Munition-Extended Range (JDAM-ER) and Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) precision-guided bombs, as well as French-donated AASM-250 Hammer rocket-assisted bombs in Ukraine and Kursk and SCALP-EG air-launched cruise missiles and similar British British Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missiles on Russian targets in Ukraine. This move could also lead to France and the U.K. easing restrictions on the use of SCALPs and Storm Shadows. A Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS), launched by an M142 HIMARS in service with Ukraine Photo by Serhii Mykhalchuk/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images It is possible this shift could also be extended to other long-range weapons the All this comes ahead of Trump's new presidency, which could see aid to Ukraine greatly diminished or cut off. While saying he can quickly end the war, Trump has yet to offer any specifics and it is unclear exactly just how he will deal with the war, especially if a peace deal cannot be reached. You can read more about this in our deep dive here. We will likely find out about the first use of ATACMS in Kursk when videos emerge on social media of missile fragments, or Ukraine makes a public announcement. While they will certainly help, it is believed that Ukraine has only a relatively small supply of these missiles. However, even that puts Russian and North Korean troops in greater danger.

One Of These Futuristic Grenade Launchers Could Succeed Where The...	The two finalists in a U.S. Army innovation challenge to craft concepts for a new futuristic precision grenade launcher have now publicly shown their designs. The service has been exploring options for years now for a highly computerized 30mm Precision Grenadier System (PGS) that soldiers could use to engage targets ranging from enemy personnel behind cover to light armored vehicles to drones in the sky. This all follows the cancellation of work on the advanced 25mm XM25 grenade launcher, nicknamed 'The Punisher,' back in 2018. Barrett Firearms, best known for its .50 caliber M82-series rifles, together with MARS, Inc., showed off a model of what they are currently calling the Squad Support Rifle System (SSRS) at the Association of the U.S. Army's (AUSA) main annual conference last month. FN America, the U.S.-based subsidiary of famed Belgian small arms company Fabrique National, had displayed a model of its PGS-001 design at last year's AUSA gathering. The SSRS and the FN PGS-001 were the designs to come out on top of the Army's xTechSoldier Lethality challenge to 'showcase their innovative concepts for a Precision Grenadier System' last year. The Squad Support Rifle System (SSRS) model on display at the 2024 AUSA gathering. Jamie Hunter In its current form, the SSRS weighs nearly 14 pounds, is just under 34 inches long, and fires 30x42mm projectiles from a five-round box magazine. True to its name, it has the general outward look of an oversized rifle, including a pistol grip, trigger assembly, and fire control selector switch that all mimic the ones found on AR-15/M16-series guns. The SSRS also has an attachment rail for optics and other accessories on top. The SSRS model at AUSA was fitted with a Vortex Optics XM157, a variable 1-8&#215;30 optic with a digital display overlay and other advanced features like a built-in laser rangefinder. The XM157 is set to be the standard optic for the Army's new 6.8mm XM7 rifles and XM250 squad automatic weapons from Sig Sauer. The XM157 optic seen on the SSRS model. Jamie Hunter In terms of ammunition, Barrett had mockups of nine different rounds on display at AUSA, including high-explosive, incendiary, armor-piercing, and dedicated training types. There was also a 'close quarters battle' (CBQ) shell, which looks to be a buckshot-like canister round. Some of the mocked-up 30x42mm rounds for the SSRS, including the black-colored 'CQB' type. Jamie Hunter More 30x42mm ammunition mockups. Jamie Hunter Specific details about the PGS-001 are more limited, but it has a roughly similar layout to the SRSS and was also previously shown with an XM157 optic installed. A prominent difference between the two is the notably large muzzle brake on FN's design. This would help mitigate recoil, especially when firing multiple shots in succession, but also create significant blast, flash, and noise. FN does not appear to have displayed ammunition types along with the PGS-001 at the 2023 AUSA convention. AUSA 23 – FN USA’s PGS-001 Precision Grenadier System pic.twitter.com/J3Q1UHkTAZ&mdash; Soldier Systems (@soldiersystems) October 10, 2023 In past PGS contracting notices, the Army has called for a family of ammunition that includes a 'Counter Defilade Round' that can 'precisely and quickly defeat personnel targets' behind cover, which would be an air-bursting design, as well as armor-piercing, CQB, and training types. A dedicated Counter Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) shell of some kind has also been on the PGS requirements list. Other previously stated PGS requirements include an overall length of 34 inches or less, a maximum weight of no more than 14.5 pounds, and an effective range of at least 1,640 feet (500 meters). 'The PGS will be a man portable integrated weapon system that enables precision engagements to destroy personnel targets in defilade and in the open with increased lethality and precision compared to the legacy M203/M320 grenade launchers,' according to one contracting notice from February 2023. 'The PGS will provide overmatch to comparable threat grenade launchers in near peer formations in future operating environments (jungle, urban, woodland, subterranean, desert, day/night/obscured). The PGS is envisioned to consist of a weapon, a fire control, and a suite of ammunition which enables the user to engage targets in defilade/cover, hovering UAS targets, conduct door breaching, engage close combat targets, and light armored targets.' The M203 and M320 mentioned here are both single-shot 40x46mm grenade launchers, which the Army primarily fields as under-barrel attachments for existing M16/M4-series guns. The M320 can also be employed in a stand-alone configuration. The maximum effective range of the M203 and M320 when firing typical high-explosive rounds is 1,148 and 1,312 feet (350 and 400 meters), respectively.

US Army As already noted, this is not the first time the Army has sought such a weapon. The core operational needs behind the PGS are extremely similar to the ones that drove the development of a 25mm advanced grenade launcher designated the XM25 and known variously as the Individual Semi-Automatic Airburst System (ISAAS) or Counter-Defilade Target Engagement (CDTE) System between the mid-2000s and the late 2010s. Also nicknamed 'The Punisher,' the XM25 had grown out of an earlier next-generation infantry weapons program called the Objective Infantry Combat Weapon (OICW) that started in the 1990s. A member of the US Army with an XM25 'Punisher' prototype. US Army Interestingly given the stated PGS requirements to date, the XM25's 14-pound weight was cited as a contributing factor in its ultimate cancellation, along with the weapon's physic bulk and its cost (as well as that of its advanced programmable ammunition). A 2018 report from Stars and Stripes quoted an Army spokesperson as saying the service had secured the rights to the XM25's technical data package (TDP), as well as prototypes and ammunition, which in turn prompted questions about whether the service might reboot its development. 'The Government does not own the XM25 TDP' and 'PGS development will start from scratch but will incorporate lessons learned from the XM25 CDTE program wherever possible,' the Army said in response to questions taken at a 2021 virtual industry day event. While the SSRS and PGS-001 clearly look now to be the front-runners in any final PGS competition, there is still a possibility that the Army could consider other designs, even including losing entries from the xTechSoldier Lethality challenge. American Rheinmetall Munitions, Knight Technical Solutions (not to be confused with Knight's Armament Company), and Plumb Precision Products had also submitted designs for xTechSoldier Lethality, details about which are limited. We do know Knight Technical Solutions' Multipurpose Intelligent Grenade System (MIGS) is a six-shot revolver-type design intended to go under the barrel of existing infantry rifles like the M203 and the M320, while Plumb Precision Products' P3-M110 is another rifle-like weapon, but chambered to fire 17.5mm rounds. It is unclear whether American Rheinmetall's entry, called the Squad Support Weapon Achieving Precision Grenadier System Objectives, is related to the 40x46mm Squad Support Weapon 40 (SSW40) from its German parent company.

The service has also explored improved 40mm ammunition types, including air-bursting rounds, to help meet these operational demands. The inclusion of a counter-drone round in the planned PGS ammunition family also underscores the growing threat posed by drones and similarly increasing demand for ways to neutralize them across the U.S. military. For the PGS effort, the counter-drone requirement is something that predates, but has also now been completely validated by the ongoing war in Ukraine, which has helped fully drive the dangers posed by uncrewed aerial systems into the mainstream consciousness. Overall, no matter what design it might ultimately pick for PGS, the Army looks to be aiming to finally succeed where 'The 'Punisher' failed.

Bunker Talk: Let’s Talk About All The Things We Did And Didn’t Co...	Welcome to Bunker Talk. This is a weekend open discussion post for the best commenting crew on the net, in which we can chat about all the stuff that went on this week that we didn’t cover. We can also talk about the stuff we did or whatever else grabs your interest. In other words, it’s an off-topic thread. The caption to this week’s top shot reads: ROME, ITALY - APRIL 4: The interiors of the air raid shelter and Mussolini's Bunker at Villa Torlonia set up with blow-ups of daily life under the bombings of Rome, historical videos, artefacts and photos of Benito Mussolini, on April 4, 2024 in Rome, Italy. After a careful restoration and the creation of a new multimedia itinerary, Mussolini's air raid shelter and bunker at Villa Torlonia reopen to the public. Villa Torlonia served as the Roman residence for Benito Mussolini and his family from 1929 to 1943. As Italy entered the war in 1940, in response to the looming threat of aerial bombings, the Duce commissioned the construction of three underground shelters beneath the Casino Nobile for protection.

F-15E Pilot Recounts Having To Switch To Guns After Missiles Ran ...	After shooting down so many Iranian drones headed toward Israel that their F-15E Strike Eagle ran out of air-to-air missiles, the jet’s crew decided they would go after one more. Ordered to use any weapon available, pilot Maj. Benjamin 'Irish' Coffey and weapons systems officer (WSO) Capt. Lacie 'Sonic' Hester dropped altitude and speed to approach the low and slow-flying drone. Though Coffey and Hester could barely see it, they unleashed a volley from the Strike Eagle’s 20mm Gatling Gun, which can fire upwards of 6,000 rounds per minute. Despite the rapid rate of fire, the Gatling gun missed the drone, Coffey told CNN. 'You feel the terrain rush, you feel yourself getting closer and closer to the ground,' Coffey told CNN. 'The risk was just too high to try again.' As we have discussed multiple times in the past, firing a fighter's gun against a small, low, and slow moving target is far more dangerous than many realize. The speed and engagement dynamics involved can result in controlled flight into the ground below as well as ramming into the very object you are trying to shoot down. There is also the danger of the grenade-like cannon rounds impacting the ground below over a relatively wide area, potentially killing innocent people. Doing it at night is a whole other level of danger. That Coffey and Hester had to resort to the gun speaks volumes about the challenge of defeating a large-scale aerial attack and using multi-million dollar advanced weaponry against cheap and far-less sophisticated drones that can evade even advanced radars like those aboard F-15Es.

(U.S. Air Force photo) Weaponized drones with long-range capabilities have become ubiquitous in Ukraine and across the Middle East. Meanwhile, the fighter pilots chasing down the Iranian drones didn't have much time before Iran's onslaught to practice, Strike Eagle pilot Lt. Col. Timothy 'Diesel' Causey told CNN. The drones 'are a low cost, low risk for the enemy to employ,' said Causey. 'They can send out massive amounts of them and we have to engage them to protect civilians and to protect our allies. We hadn’t started practicing on a large scale yet.' 'You’re talking about something that is on the very edge of a fighter aircraft’s ability to detect — what we call ‘find, fix, track, target and engage,’' Coffey explained. 'The best radar in the inventory is in this airplane behind us, and no one really knew whether or not its capability to find these [drones] even existed.' All told, forward-deployed F-15Es from units based at RAF Lakenheath in England and Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina played an outsized role in shooting down more than 70 Iranian drones on April 13 and 14. The defense against 300 missiles and drones launched from Iran and Houthi-controlled territory in Yemen was what the Air Force called its 'largest air-to-air enemy engagement in over 50 years.' Coalition forces and Israel destroyed nearly 99% of all inbound weapons. U.S. Air Force Photo/Staff Sgt. Devin Rumbaugh Causey, the 494th FS commander, chalked up his team’s success to remaining focused.'We all fell into an execution rhythm: call, shoot, and confirm the target was destroyed before we moved on to the next task we had to accomplish to keep everyone safe,' Causey said. The scope and challenges of the effort to take down the threats heading toward Israel were not lost on Air Force leadership. During an awards ceremony earlier this week at RAF Lakenheath in the U.K., Coffey and Hester were awarded Silver Star medals, the third highest honor for valor in combat. Hester was the first woman in the Air Force ever to receive one. The Silver Stars were presented 'based on the aircrew’s gallantry in action repelling the Iranian attack as the airborne mission commanders directing coalition forces during the unprecedented large-scale attack against Israel,' the Air Force stated.The team 'engaged the enemy multiple times throughout the night despite having severe aircraft emergencies and while under falling debris at the expeditionary base caused by hostile fire from the enemy,' the Air Force explained.'Although intelligence provided the numbers of how many (one-way attack) drones we could expect to see, it was still surprising to see them all,' said Hester.

(U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Olivia Gibson) 'It takes a high-performing team with high-performing individuals to be able to find these things to begin with, and then to engage it,' said Coffey, who described the challenges the mission presented and how the teams worked in tandem. 'We have the pilots working the air-to-air radar, (to) make sure they don't hit the ground, they don't hit their element leads and (we’re) employing and we start to get another data point and another data point and another data point,' he explained.

(U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Seleena Muhammad-Ali) Air Force Gen.James Hecker, head of U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), as well as Air Forces Africa (AFAFRICA) and NATO’s Allied Air Command, also awarded six Distinguished Flying Crosses with the valor device, four Distinguished Flying Crosses with the combat device, four Distinguished Flying Crosses, two Bronze Stars, seven Air and Space Commendation Medals and seven Air and Space Achievement Medals. Other aircrews recognized during the ceremony received Distinguished Flying Crosses 'for their commitment to their mission, flying their F-15Es through a complex and dangerous airspace filled with engagements by active air defense systems and falling debris multiple times that night,' the Air Force noted. Awards were also presented to those on the ground who kept the aircraft flying despite ballistic missiles and Patriot effectors zipping overhead, and falling debris. That evening the 494th Fighter Generation Squadron (FGS), represented by 66 Airmen, 'launched 14 F-15E sorties, including scrambling six alert aircraft amid a backdrop of active base defenses destroying enemy targets overhead,' according to the Air Force. Maj. Clayton Wicks, operations supervisor, and Master Sgt. Timothy Adams, lead production superintendent for the 494th FGS that evening were awarded the Bronze Star, a United States Armed Forces decoration awarded to members of the military for heroic or meritorious service in combat, 'for their actions that evening to ensure every combat-capable aircraft was in the fight and ensure the airfield remained viable for operations,' the Air Force explained.'It still gives me chills when I think about how well the team worked together,' said Adams. 'I wasn’t the linchpin of that. I was just the guy holding the radio, the node between ops and maintenance. The team is who made it happen. The APG [aircraft maintenance] driver, the weapons teams, the POL [fuels], all those people working together, not running, not dropping the hoses, not just freaking out and worried about their own lives. How could you not be proud of that?' 'Our airmen stood firm alongside our coalition partners to protect Israel from a barrage of one-way attack unmanned aerial vehicles and missiles,' said Hecker. 'The success of our Airmen demonstrates how the U.S. Air Force is ready to respond to, and defeat, evolving threats.'

The Time Germany Grafted An Army Howitzer Turret Onto A Frigate	German Navy warships were once nearly armed with gun turrets taken from land-based PzH 2000 self-propelled howitzers. The installation was tested in experiments around a decade ago, with some positive results. Although it was ultimately considered too complex an undertaking, it reflected a broader focus on increasing the range and accuracy of naval guns, efforts which continue today. Under the MONARC (Modular Naval Artillery Concept) program, Germany was one of many nations looking to increase the firepower of its warships’ main guns at the start of the new century. To do this, it looked at adapting the turret and 155mm main armament of the PzH 2000 (or Panzerhaubitze 2000) for naval use. A slide from a Rheinmetall presentation showing two views of the Pzh 2000 turret and gun installed on the frigate Hamburg while in dock. Rheinmetall By the end of 2002, 185 of the PzH 2000s had already been delivered to the German Army and the system had established a reputation as among the most capable self-propelled howitzers in service anywhere. Export orders had already been signed in Greece, Italy, and the Netherlands. The PzH 2000 began life as a joint project, with Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, as the general contractor, providing the tracked armored vehicles and Rheinmetall delivering the main armament and ammunition. Key features of the PzH 2000 include highly automated navigation and fire control functions. Meanwhile, a fully automatic ammunition-handling system means the gun can fire 10 rounds per minute — or a three-round burst in 10 seconds. These projectiles can hit targets at 25 miles, using standard ammunition, with a very high degree of accuracy conferred by a high-precision gun-laying system. There was also the promise of even longer-range ammunition, with Rheinmetall working on rounds that would be able to hit targets at around 50 miles. Compare this with the performance of the main guns on the F124 Sachsen class frigates then being built for the German Navy: the 76mm OTO Melara Compact weapon can, according to the service, hit targets at a range of 11 miles. At the same time, the Compact weapon fires a smaller and lighter round than the PzH 2000 and it can also fire much quicker: at a rate of up to 120 rounds per minute in the Super Rapid version. The German Navy frigate Hessen with the normal deck gun for the F124 Sachsen class: the 76mm OTO Melara Compact. U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Kaysee Lohmann/Released MC3 Kaysee Lohmann As well as Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and Rheinmetall, the MONARC program involved German shipbuilder Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft (HDW), and the team set out, in Rheinmetall’s words to 'create a whole new dimension in surface combatant firepower.' The program sought to improve the range and firepower of the German Navy’s shipborne artillery, but also do it at a relatively low cost since the land-based PzH 2000 was already in production and service. To test the concept, the yet-to-be-completed F124 class frigate Hamburg was fitted with a PzH 2000 turret and gun, mounted on the foredeck, where the 76mm Compact gun would usually be fitted. Another set of Rheinmetall photos showing the Pzh 2000 turret and gun being installed on the frigate. Rheinmetall In terms of weight and dimensions, integrating the new weapon was not too problematic. The weight difference was not significant and the F124 class could easily absorb the extra mass, while the space requirements above and below decks were found to be not too different from the 76mm Compact. However, the major challenge involved the much greater recoil encountered with the PzH 2000’s big 155mm gun. This required an elastic mounting for the weapon, protecting the structure of the warship through force transference. 'By using a flexible mounting rather than rigidly fixing the turret to the deck in the conventional manner, the impact of residual acceleration on the structure of the ship during firing is expected to remain at an acceptable level,' Rheinmetall said at the time. 'Since the turret is essentially self-sufficient, all that is required is a 24-volt power connection and a secure link to the operations room and the bridge. In addition, the ammunition storage and handling systems will have to be modified. Furthermore, in order to compensate for the movement of the ship, the gun-laying system will have to be stabilized.' The finished temporary Pzh 2000 turret and gun installation on the frigate. Rheinmetall Rheinmetall At the time, Rehimentall claimed the temporary installation of the PzH 2000 turret on the Hamburg demonstrated that it retained the performance of the original gun — and also that it could be fitted in a cost-effective way, something that was later questioned. Nevertheless, the companies behind MONARC were confident that the gun could be retrofitted to existing hulls as well as incorporated on new-build frigates and even corvettes. Test firings of MONARC were conducted, although it’s unclear if these also involved the installation on the Hamburg, which had the turret removed and replaced with a 76mm Compact weapon ahead of its commissioning in December 2004. However, there were confirmed firings from a land-based test platform that replicated the shipborne installation, carried out by Rheinmetall at its firing range in Unterlüß, northern Germany. The first of these took place in June 2003 and was intended to test the dynamic forces acting on the ship’s deck and internal structure. The MONARC system is test-fired at Unterlüß, northern Germany. Rheinmetall On top of the additional range that the navalized PzH 2000 would offer, it could also call upon a variety of ammunition types, to suit different targets. In this way, it could be optimized for striking targets on land, or against warships and other vessels. As well as the three-strong F124 class, the four frigates of the F125 Baden-Württemberg class were seen as likely candidates for MONARC. The relatively toothless armament fit of the F125 class is something that TWZ has commented on before, and which more recently led to one of the frigates rerouted to avoid the Red Sea, albeit due to the warship’s very limited air defenses. The main gun of the F125 class is a 127mm OTO Melara, with a stated range of more than 50 miles when using specialized ammunition. The same gun has since been selected for Germany’s future F126 class of ‘super-sized’ frigate, six of which are planned. The German Navy frigate Baden-Württemberg and its 127mm 127mm OTO Melara gun. Photo by Ted ALJIBE / AFP TED ALJIBE In the event, it was determined that adapting the PzH 2000 for use by warships was simply too onerous — in particular, the modifications needed to deal with the recoil were considerable. Coupled with the need for a new stabilized gun-laying system, there was also the fact that the existing ammunition for the PzH 2000 was provided in two parts: cartridge case and projectile. In contrast, ammunition for ships’ guns has long been provided as single-element, fixed ammunition. Either a new set of ammunition would have had to be developed for the MONARC — requiring gun modifications, too — or warships and crews would have had to adapt to the land-based standards. Other reports suggest that the overall cost was, after all, also much higher than anticipated. Another view of the land-based MONARC test rig. Rheinmetall Despite these problems, the kind of solution offered by MONARC also found interest outside of Germany around the same time. In France, thought was given to adapting the GIAT CAESAR 155mm self-propelled howitzer for naval use, combined with the PELICAN guided ammunition that offered a range of 53 miles. The United Kingdom’s BAE Systems meanwhile proposed a naval version of its AS90 Braveheart self-propelled gun, which promised to achieve a rate of fire of 18 rounds per minute. For its part, the U.S. Navy has also explored putting 155mm artillery on warships, although the Advanced Gun System for its stealthy Zumwalt class destroyers was intended for naval use from the outset. However, as costs rose dramatically, the Navy in 2016 opted not to buy any ammunition for those guns and, more recently, decided to remove the turrets and replace them with hypersonic missiles, as you can read about here. The U.S. Navy didn’t give up on the idea of 155mm naval artillery entirely, however, with experiments continuing under the tri-service Moving Target Artillery Round (MTAR). A test firing to demonstrate the Advanced Gun System at Dugway Proving Ground, Utah. U.S. Navy photo by Ken Tillges/Released Ken Tillges Overall, the concept of swapping out traditional naval guns for large-caliber artillery — and especially adapting land-based systems for this purpose — has been eclipsed by the arrival of much longer-range ammunition even for medium-caliber weapons. As an example of this, the Leonardo VULCANO ammunition, in 76mm caliber, has a range of over 19 miles in its unguided version, used for anti-air, anti-surface, and naval gunfire support missions. This is increased to more than 25 miles when using guided long-range ammunition, which is optimized for shore bombardment. Furthermore, any existing NATO-standard 76mm gun can be adapted to fire the VULCANO ammunition, with no requirement for a new turret to be installed. While navies around the world continue to look for the right balance between compact and lightweight naval guns, and enhanced range and accuracy, the focus is now very much on using advanced types of ammunition, rather than more radical solutions like the MONARC, which remains a short-lived and fairly unique installation.

Details About Search For Mystery Object Shot Down Over Lake Huron...	The search for clues after a U.S. Air Force F-16 Viper fighter brought down a still-unidentified object over Lake Huron in February 2023 did result in the recovery of debris it has been disclosed. However, it remains unclear whether or not the wreckage was from that shootdown. The new details continue to raise more questions about the downing of this and two other mystery objects that same month in American and Canadian skies, and why more information has not been made public. Canada’s CTV News first reported on the previously unannounced debris recovery as part of the search for whatever was left of what had been sailing through the sky above Lake Huron on February 12, 2023, earlier today. This and other new information in CTV News' story comes from a string of Emails between Canadian military officials and members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), as well as a heavily redacted Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) report. The records were obtained via a request under Canada’s Access to Information Act, which is similar in many respects to the U.S. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), but is accessible only to Canadian citizens. An F-16C belonging to the Minnesota Air National Guard's 148th Fighter Wing returns to base after being involved in the operation that led to the shooting down of the mystery object over Lake Huron on February 12, 2023. The red circle highlights an empty underwing station indicating this particular aircraft took a shoot at the object with an AIM-9X Sidewinder missile. @Badger_wings A total of three unidentified objects soaring in U.S. and Canadian airspace were brought down by U.S. Air Force jets in as many days in February 2023. The Lake Huron shootdown followed ones in the skies off the coast of Alaska and over Canada's Yukon Territory on February 10 and 11 of that year. This all also came after the downing of a Chinese spy balloon, which had been passing over parts of the United States and Canada for days, off the coast of South Carolina on February 4. Previous official statements about and audio recordings from the Lake Huron shootown have described the object as having an octagonal shape with strings hanging from it, along with may have been a small dark-colored payload suspended beneath. 'Debris was discovered last week (reported I believe through CAF [Canadian Armed Forces] comms line) and the RCMP now has possession of it. I understand there is both material and a module,' Mark Flynn, the RCMP's Deputy Commissioner for Federal Policing, wrote in an Email to the CAF's Brig. Gen. Eric Laforest, then Strategic Joint Staff Director General Operations, on March 13, 2023. 'The module is from a company who sells weather monitoring equipment. It will be analyzed to determine if there is anything unusual with it but I suspect not given the size. Whether or not it is from the shoot down is uncertain.' It's also interesting to note here that a Canadian Strategic Joint Staff briefing slide from May 2023 explicitly mentions 'debris near, or in Canadian waters' following the Lake Huron shootdown, but provides no further details, at least that are unredacted. Independent researcher Steve Te shared slides from this briefing, which was given during a meeting between members of the CAF and the country's Office of the Chief Science Advisor in relation to the Sky Canada Project, on X last week. Launched in 2022, Sky Canada has been working 'to study how Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) reports from the public are managed in Canada and to recommend improvements.' My article from July described a meeting between the Office of the Chief Science Advisor and Canada's military in which they discussed Sky Canada Project and Strategic Joint Staff presented slides on the UAP shoot downs of Feb 2023. I've obtained those slides! #UAP pic.twitter.com/aCLRevXhxa&mdash; Steve Te. (@Steve_uap2020) November 7, 2024 'Following reports of unidentified aerial objects observed in the Great Lakes area and elsewhere in North America, multiple searches were conducted by the RCMP with the support of the Canadian Armed Forces,' the RCMP told CTV News in response to questions about the new documents it obtained. 'Debris has been recovered from the shores of Lake Huron but after careful analysis, it was determined not to be of national security concern.' The outlet says that the RCMP declined to confirm or deny whether the debris was ultimately determined to be from whatever was brought down over Lake Huron. The redacted RCAF report that CTV News obtained, which is dated February 16, 2023, further suggests that the object might have been a weather balloon launched from a U.S. National Weather Service radar station in Michigan, as seen below. This would align with the RCMP's subsequent recovery of a weather monitoring module. RCAF via CTV News The report from the RCAF also reiterates a widely reported theory that the object shot down separately over the Yukon was a so-called 'pico' balloon, which amateur radio enthusiasts regularly launch across North America. That document mentions a 'poss[ible] stratospheric balloon transparent outer and mylar or other material inner,' as well, but it is not entirely clear what object this might be referring to. A portion of the redacted RCAF report discussing the object downed over the Yukon that mentions the possibility of it being a pico ballion. RCAF via CTV News This portion of the redacted RCAF report mentions a possible stratospheric balloon, but what exactly it is referring to is unclear. RCAF via CTV News In September, CTV News published the first known image of the Yukon object, which Canadian authorities have also referred to as Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) 23, which was also released as part of an Access to Information Act request. You can find The War Zone's analysis of the image, seen below, here. Canadian DND via Access to Information Request Via CTV News Whether or not what the RCMP found on the Canadian side of Lake Huron was related to the shootdown on February 12, 2023, the disclosure raises significant new questions. Before now, neither U.S. authorities nor their Canadian counterparts had confirmed recovering anything at all in their searches following the downing of the three still-unidentified objects in the skies over those countries that month. The owners and/or operators of those objects, and whatever their purposes might have been, remain unknown, at least publicly. 'The location chosen for this shoot down afforded us the opportunity to avoid impact to people on the ground while improving chances for debris recovery. There are no indications of any civilians hurt or otherwise affected,' the Pentagon had said in a statement following the shootdown. 'We did not assess it to be a kinetic military threat to anything on the ground, but assess it was a safety flight hazard and a threat due to its potential surveillance capabilities. Our team will now work to recover the object in an effort to learn more.' 'After conducting an extensive search in the Lake Huron area with the assistance of the Canadian Coast Guard and other domestic and international partners, a decision was reached to suspend the search due to several factors including deteriorating weather and the low probability of recovery,' RCMP then said in a press release it put out on February 16, 2023. 'This investigation is in its very early stages and will take time. We will share additional information when it becomes available as the recovery efforts and investigation unfold.' This is the latest in a string of serious transparency questions to emerge about these incidents. CTV News obtained the UAP 23 image along with Emails showing a deliberate decision to withhold its release despite an initial push to do so. Last year, the outlet published another internal Canadian government memo that prompted discussion about what Canadian and U.S. authorities might or might not know about the three objects downed in 2023, as well as other UAPs the two countries had previously monitored in their airspace. Then-Canadian Chief of Defense Staff Gen. Wayne Eyre, seen here at left walking with Vice Chief of Space Operations Gen. David Thompson during a visit to the Pentagon in November 2023, was among those who initially pressed for the release of the UAP 23 image. Eric Dietrich/USAF Eric Dietrich On the U.S. military side, promises to release imagery from and other information about the February 2023 shootdowns have so far gone unfulfilled. This, in turn, has fed into still-unsubstantiated accusations of more active coverups within the U.S. government, including by the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO). Established in 2022, AARO's mission is to be a focal point for collecting data about UAPs and investigating reported sightings, but whether it is adequately resourced and authorized to do so has been questioned in the past. The possibility that a U.S. Air Force F-16 shot down a U.S. government weather balloon over Lake Huron in February 2023 also highlights separate concerns about the ability of American and Canadian authorities to monitor the airspace above their respective countries. The Chinese spy balloon episode that month had prompted the U.S. military to acknowledge what it described as a 'domain awareness gap.' American officials said at the time that immediate steps had been taken to rectify that deficiency, including changing data-collection parameters on various air defense radars, and that more action on that front was coming. AARO notably just released new details yesterday about a sensor suite called GREMLIN that it has acquired specifically to help collect data on UAP sightings, which you can read about here. A graphic giving a very general overview of the GREMLIN sensor suite. AARO Still, even before the Febraury 2023 incidents, a worrisome trend of encounters with aerial objects – many assessed to be drones, as well as balloons and other lighter-than-air craft – over and around the United States had already emerged. This has only continued since then, with a series of still-unexplained and unauthorized drone flights over Langley Air Force Base in Virginia over the course of several weeks in December 2023 now having become a particular national cause célèbre. The War Zone was the first report on the Langely drone incursions and has otherwise long been at the forefront of reporting on these issues. In 2021, we laid out a detailed case for how a portion of sightings of UAPs (or Unidentified Flying Objects, or UFOs, as they have been more commonly called in the past) have very likely been platforms operated by adversaries or potential adversaries for surveillance and other malign purposes. Questions about the adequacy of U.S. domestic air defense capabilities, especially when it comes to countering the growing threat of drones, an area where the U.S. military continues to lag behind, are also now more fully entering the public consciousness. In the United States, members of Congress are now very actively pushing for greater transparency regarding UAPs and related issues, in general. When it comes to the trio of shootdowns in February 2023, details do now look to be steadily, if slowly trickling out from the Canadian side, though still not proactively. In the meantime, definitive assessments about what those objects were, especially the one downed off the coast of Alaska that remains the most mysterious, and who might been operating them are still elusive.

North Korea’s Kim Orders Mass Production Of Kamikaze Drones	During a visit to an exercise range where he watched tests of ‘kamikaze’ drones in action, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un announced the country would begin mass production of one-way attack uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs). The development comes as North Korea and Russia significantly step up their military cooperation — including joint work on drones — raising the possibility that North Korean UAVs could also start being used in the war in Ukraine before too long. North Korean state media reported on Kim’s appearance at the firing range today, also publishing photos and a video showing the live-fire tests. The North Korean leader was seen watching the drones strike targets including a BMW sedan and a decommissioned T-34 tank. The likely location of the exercise was close to Pyongyang International Airport, according to open-source analysis. A drone heads toward a BMW sedan on the firing range. North Korean state media The sedan is left burning after the drone impact. North Korean state media One of the X-wing drones heads toward a tank target on the firing range. North Korean state media Another drone, moments before impacting the tank target. North Korean state media Kim called on officials to 'quickly establish a mass-production system and begin full-scale production as soon as possible,' according to a report in the Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea, translated by news aggregator KCNA Watch. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un inspects the drones on the firing range. North Korean state media 'The scope of their use in military operations is constantly expanding due to their low production costs and simple manufacturing processes,' Kim said, according to the same source. The state-released imagery had the details of the drones pixelated, but they appear to be the same types that we profiled back in August and which, we assessed back then, appeared very similar in outward appearance to the Israeli-made Harop and the Hero-400 loitering munitions. The second, X-wing drone also has more than a passing resemblance to members of the Lancet family, although the Israeli Hero-400 seems to be a closer match overall.

North Korean state media You can read our previous analysis of the two drones here — which included raising the possibility of them eventually being exported to Russia and potentially other clients. The latest imagery reveals more details of the launch systems for the two drones. The Harop lookalike takes off from a conventional rail-type launcher, while the X-wing drone that appears similar to the Hero-400 can be launched from either a portable rail launcher or from a canister-like tube. Launch of one of the Harpy-lookalike drones on the firing range. North Korean state media In the latest reports, the North Korean state media claim that the drones are products of the Unmanned Aerial Technology Complex, or UATC. The report from Rodong Sinmun today claimed that the two drones are 'designed for use across different strike ranges on land and sea and are tasked with precise strikes on designated targets.' North Korean leader Kim Jong Un takes a closer look at an X-wing drone. North Korean state media When they were unveiled, there were suggestions from North Korea that the drones might use a rudimentary form of artificial intelligence, for a degree of automated target detection and engagement, although details were scarce. TWZ surmised that the reports to this effect might have referred to detect radar emissions along a pre-planned route, or some basic form of visual target recognition. Meanwhile, the looming prospect of drones of all kinds using more advanced artificial intelligence on a regular basis is also something we have discussed in the past. The statements today said the drones 'flew along pre-set tactical routes within various strike ranges and successfully carried out precise strikes on their targets.' Kim Jong Un watches drones being launched. North Korean state media Since these types of drones first appeared in the summer, the military relationship between Pyongyang and Moscow has deepened considerably, now including the deployment of thousands of troops for Russia’s conflict in Ukraine. So far, North Korea has supplied Russia with a variety of weapons that it’s employed in Ukraine, including KN-23 short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs), Bulsae-4 anti-tank missiles, and rocket-propelled grenades. Most significant — at least in terms of numbers — has been Pyongyang’s provision of artillery ammunition, mostly in 122mm and 152mm caliber, to feed Russia’s unceasing demand for shells. According to a recent assessment from the South Korean National Intelligence Service (NIS), North Korea has likely delivered more than eight million 122mm and 152mm shells to Russia so far. Only yesterday, we reported on the appearance of North Korean-made 170mm M1989 Koksan self-propelled artillery units being transported by rail in Krasnoyarsk, in central Russia. This may well be a sign that North Korea is also now providing Russia with heavy artillery, although it’s possible that these units were heading to Ukraine for use by North Korean troops, too.

This may well be a sign that North Korea is also now providing Russia with heavy artillery, although it’s possible that these units were heading to Ukraine for use by North Korean troops, too. via X With all this in mind, it would not be a huge surprise if Russia calls upon North Korea to provide one-way attack drones, to bolster its own production of these weapons, which have become a significant feature of the battlefield in Ukraine, with both sides, with larger and longer-range types, such as the Shahed, regularly attacking infrastructure and urban targets across Ukraine. It should be noted here that it’s not entirely clear what Pyongyang is getting in return for all this, although as well as hard currency, it seems likely that it is receiving technological assistance and could also be getting Russian arms, as well. There have been various signs that North Korea and Russia are now collaborating on drone programs. This seems to include Moscow providing Pyongyang with technical assistance on uncrewed aerial vehicles. Earlier this month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that North Korean workers were being sent to Russia to work in factories producing kamikaze drones. While the UAVs in question would likely be of Russian design, this could be part of a broader technical agreement in which North Korea gains experience in manufacturing these types of drones. A Russian factory undertaking license production of the Iranian-designed Shahed-series one-way attack drones — named Geran (geranium) in Russia. via X There certainly appear to be growing efforts to build up North Korea’s drone-manufacturing base, even before today’s announcement. In June this year, it was reported that a new large-scale UAV factory was being built near Panghyon Air Base. On an operational level, there is also growing evidence that drone units from North Korea and Russia are working together more closely. South Korean intelligence has reportedly found evidence of North Korean troops receiving training in drone operations in Russia. A course in the operation of quadcopter-type drones at the Russian University of Special Forces in Gudermes, Chechnya. Russian University of Special Forces Last week, Business Insider cited Andrii Kovalenko, the head of Ukraine’s Center for Countering Disinformation, who also said that North Korean soldiers were undergoing drone training from Russian forces. Kovalenko said that North Korean soldiers were learning to operate strike and reconnaissance UAVs, under conditions simulating live combat. Once trained, these troops could employ drones in Ukraine, alongside Russian forces, or they could bring their skills back to North Korea. The value of training on modern systems like kamikaze drones is huge for North Korea, which has not fought a conventional war since the 1950s and which has armed forces that still primarily rely on mainly outdated equipment — and, for the most part, tactics to match. North Korean soldiers march during a mass rally on Kim Il Sung Square in Pyongyang. Photo by ED JONES/AFP via Getty Images ED JONES As well as taking notes from Russian (and Ukrainian) employment of one-way attack UAVs in the war in Ukraine, North Korea has a lot to gain from hands-on experience with these kinds of weapons, on the training ground — and potentially also in combat in Ukraine. While there’s meanwhile little doubt about Pyongyang and Moscow’s joint UAV efforts, aside from Ukraine, it’s worth noting that kamikaze drones would be enormously useful to North Korea, during any kind of conflict on the peninsula. As we have explored in the past, loitering munitions would be ideally suited to combat around the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). Meanwhile, the Harop-like design would likely have the reach to strike fixed installations across South Korea in the opening phase of a major conflict on the peninsula. Earlier this week, North Korea and Russia ratified a mutual defense treaty, stating that the two countries would assist each other in the event of an attack on one of them. Against this backdrop, it seems that the military relationship between Pyongyang and Moscow will only intensify. With that, the prospect of increased drone collaboration between the two countries will also become more likely.

Military’s Recently Deployed UFO-Hunting Aerial Surveillance Syst...	The Pentagon provided new details today about how its deployable, readily reconfigurable suite of sensors called GREMLIN works to help set the stage for figuring out what unidentified objects in our skies are and are not, if they appear at all. In its annual report released on Thursday, the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) shared a graphic that gives us our best look yet at what its GREMLIN system is. It was developed by Georgia Tech Research Institute specifically to help gather data about so-called unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAPs. That’s the DoD's new parlance for what used to be called UFOs. When AARO last discussed GREMLIN back in March, the office said the system was designed to provide 'hyperspectral surveillance to try to capture these incidents.' However, no details were given about what kind of sensors were being used to capture data across different areas of the electromagnetic spectrum simultaneously. Now deployed, GREMLIN includes 2D and 3D radars, long-range electro-optical/infrared sensors, GPS, satellite communications, aircraft tracking systems and radio frequency spectrum monitoring. It all feeds into a central node where the data can be fused to get a better sense of what’s out there. The system is something of an integrated air defense apparatus 'in a box,' allowing for multiple sensor types and open-source data to be captured on single targets within its view. AARO began using GREMLIN 'for detecting, tracking, and characterizing UAP,' the report notes. 'GREMLIN demonstrated functionality and successfully collected data during a test event in March of 2024. The next step for GREMLIN is a 90-day pattern of life collection at a site of national security.' AARO's official logo. (DoD) One of AARO’s first missions for GREMLIN is to help establish a baseline for what would be considered normal activity, especially because so many UAPs have been reported either through sensors near military installations or by pilots. According to today’s report, nearly half of the 485 UAP sightings reported from May 1, 2023 to June 1, 2024 came from locations near U.S. military assets and sensors at home and abroad. This could be due to the objects being tasked to surveil those locations or due to sensor bias, as these areas are more heavily monitored than others, or more likely a mix of both. East Asian seas were the hottest spot, providing 100 reports of which AARO resolved 40 as balloons or drones. AARO placed the remaining cases in Active Archive due to insufficient information to facilitate analysis, the report states. 'Right now we have this geographic bias where we are getting reports near the national security sites, but we also have a bias from pilots and other security personnel,' AARO's new Director Jon Kosloski told reporters today. 'So we want to have a better understanding of what normal looks like near those national security sites, and then eventually we'll be expanding our baseline investigations to other areas in the US to look at what normal looks like away from national security sites.' AARO Kosloski refused to divulge where GREMLIN is located. 'It's currently deployed, he explained. 'We'd rather not say exactly where it is, because we want it to be an unbiased test, and don't want to invite folks to come and do flyovers and test against the system.' The location was chosen, he added, 'because of the environment. We expect there to be a lot of variety in the types of things that we're going to see. And there have been UAP reports in that general area. And we're trying to build a baseline.' Once a pattern of life is established, the report suggested that AARO could use that to go back over some of the 444 cases placed in the Active Archive 'because they lacked sufficient data to facilitate analysis.' All told, AARO found that 49 cases during the reporting period were objects like balloons, birds and drones. 'An additional 243cases were recommended for closure as of June 1, 2024, pending peer review,' the report pointed out. 'These cases also resolved to prosaic objects including balloons, birds, UAS, satellites, and aircraft.' 'AARO determined 21 cases merit further analysis by its IC [intelligence community] and science and technology (S&T) partners,' the report acknowledged. AARO One thing AARO did not find was any indication that UAPs are either extraterrestrial or from an adversary here on Earth. 'AARO has discovered no verifiable evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity or technology,' Kosloski said. 'None of the cases resolved by AARO have pointed to advanced capabilities or breakthrough technologies.' Just because no evidence has been found of breakthrough technology does not mean the possibility doesn’t exist, he emphasized. 'There are definitely anomalies,' Kosloski explained. 'We have not been able to draw the link to extraterrestrials.' 'We're not ruling it out,' he added. Though the report found that there were 18 incidents of drones near U.S. nuclear infrastructure, weapons, and launch sites, Kosloski said there is no indication that either those or reported UAPs belonged to adversaries. 'We have not been able to correlate any UAP activity to adversarial collection activities or advanced technologies,' he posited. The report also didn’t cover the drone incursions over Langley Air Force Base last December we were the first to report back in March. You can read more about it in our exclusive story here. 'It was known to be UAV activity, so we were there in a supporting role, but it was not our responsibility to address that,' Kosloski stated. AARO's new Director Jon Kosloski (DoD Image) As it has been since UFOs first burst into the public's consciousness back in the 1950s, the stigma of reporting them continues to keep people from coming forward to say what they’ve seen. Kosloski said he is concerned that could give adversaries an opening to collect data over sensitive locations. This is something TWZ has long highlighted as a major strategic awareness failure. Kosloski is 'concerned that somebody could use the potential stigma to try and take advantage of that. If there is a stigma associated with reporting UAP, then that's an opportunity for the adversary to maybe conduct collection operations and not have folks report on it. But we haven't seen evidence of that yet.' In an effort to help diminish the stigma of reporting UAPs, Kosloski said AARO is working with partners in the intelligence community and other government agencies to downgrade the classification ratings of incidents to make them more available to the public. Video of some of the cases AARO has discussed publicly will be released on Nov. 19th. 'The hope is that we will be able to release as much of that content as we can to the public so that we can get help in resolving them,' Kosloski commented. More quickly and accurately identifying what some of the objects are is the hope for GREMLIN as well. AARO has been under heavy ridicule by some proponents of UAP action, with claims that it is part of a coverup and has not executed its duties in good faith. Kosloski has taken over the office from its previous head, Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, who has repeatedly stood by his office's investigations and methods. AARO’s recent report on the history of the US government and UAP was perhaps the worst government report I've ever seen. Adding insult to injury, its findings were uncritically reported by the mainstream press. To help set the record straight, I consulted a group of UAP…&mdash; Christopher K. Mellon (@ChrisKMellon) April 12, 2024 The fact that AARO has not shared satellite imagery of UAP with Congress is itself evidence of an effort to keep Congress in the dark. #uaphearing&mdash; Christopher K. Mellon (@ChrisKMellon) July 26, 2023 The release of AARO's latest report also comes a day after another UAP was held on Capitol Hill, with witnesses making claims that appear at odds with AARO's past findings, especially in regard to secret UAP recovery programs. Another congressional hearing on November 19th will put AARO and its latest findings specifically in the spotlight.

‘Cheap’ Cruise Missile Program To Speed Up With Replicator Initia...	The U.S. Air Force is accelerating work on low-cost air vehicles that could evolve into relatively cheap cruise missiles, and plans to scale up production of selected designs, with the help of the Pentagon's Replicator initiative. Demand across the U.S. military for more stand-off munitions, and less expensive ones that can produced faster, is only growing, especially amid planning for future high-end conflicts, especially one against China in the Pacific. The Pentagon announced yesterday that the Enterprise Test Vehicle (ETV) program, which the Air Force is running in cooperation with the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), was among a second tranche of 'capabilities' to get a boost through the Replicator initiative. The Pentagon first announced Replicator last year with the ambitious goal of helping to get thousands of new uncrewed platforms with high degrees of autonomy into the hands of U.S. forces by August 2025. A design from Leidos subsidiary Dynetics now in development as part of the Enterprise Test Vehicle (ETV) program. Leidos Dynetics 'The ETV's modular design and open system architecture make it an ideal platform for program offices to test out new capabilities at the sub-system level, reducing risk, and demonstrating various options for weapon employment,' Air Force Gen. Jim Slife, the service's Vice Chief of Staff, said in a statement accompanying the Replicator tranche 1.2 announcement. 'We are excited to be a part of Replicator 1.2 and to increase the speed of the ETV effort.' At present, four companies – Anduril Industries, Integrated Solutions for Systems, Inc., Leidos subsidiary Dynetics, and Zone 5 Technologies – are currently building prototypes for ETV with the expectation that all of them will be flight-tested. 'Select ETV prototypes will be accelerated to scaled production,' according to the Pentagon's Replicator 1.2 press release. A rendering of Zone 5's ETV design. Zone 5 via DIU A rendering of Zone 5's ETV concept. Zone 5 via DIU Back in June, DIU had said that 'initial flight demonstrations will occur within seven months from the agreement award dates, after which one or multiple of the most promising prototypes will continue development toward a production variant capable of rapidly scalable manufacture.' Details about the various ETV designs remain limited, with the exception of Anduril's entry, which is a member of the company's Barracuda family that was unveiled in September. The Barracuda-500 version that is involved in the ETV program has a stated payload capacity of up to 100 pounds and an expected air-launched maximum range of up to 500 miles. You can read more about what is known about the other ETV designs here. It's also worth noting here that there has been some debate about whether the Air Force and DIU view the ETV designs are being more missile or drone-like at their core. The War Zone has highlighted in the past how the line between drones, especially longer-range kamikaze types, and cruise missiles, as well as decoys carrying electronic warfare payloads, is becoming more and more blurry. This is all now further underscored by the ETV program's inclusion in the drone-centric Replicator initiative. A rendering of the ETV design from Integrated Solutions for Systems. Integrated Solutions for Systems, Inc. via DIU ETV's selection to be part of Replicator 1.2 also highlights the effort's very vocal focus on exploring new manufacturing techniques and expanding the available industrial base for stand-off munitions beyond large established prime contractors. ETV presents a path 'to expand our industrial base into non-traditional suppliers that perhaps have not historically been large-scale munitions producers,' the Air Force’s Gen. Slife said in July. 'If the manufacturing techniques we’re able to leverage pan out we’ll be able to take advantage of a bigger part of the American industrial base to produce munitions for us.' Anduril is a particularly prime example of the greater attention that smaller or otherwise non-traditional companies are getting from America's armed forces when it comes to missiles and other higher-end systems. Since its founding in 2017, the company has been steadily securing larger and larger U.S. military contracts for an increasingly wide variety of drones, loitering munitions, and other capabilities. Two other Anduril products, the Altius-600M loitering munition and the Ghost-X drone helicopter, were also included in the Replicator 1.2 tranche by way of U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Army programs, respectively. The Performance Drone Works C100 quadcopter and AeroVironment Switchblade 600 loitering munition were also named. 'Rapid acquisition, large-scale production, and mass employment of autonomous systems will fundamentally transform the way we deter or, if necessary, prevail in conflict,' Anduril said in a statement after the Replicator 1.2 announcement. 'We look forward to continuing our work with the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Defense Innovation Unit, the Services, and warfighters in support of the Replicator initiative, and remain committed to delivering capabilities at speeds and scale that matter.' Other smaller companies are increasingly in the mix, too, especially when it comes to relatively cheap stand-off munitions. In August, powerful technology incubator Y Combinator notably announced its first foray into the defense sector with funding for start-up Ares Industries and its low-cost anti-ship cruise missile concept. The U.S. military has a critical need now to increase its stand-off weapon stockpiles, and to have more options for replenishing them should a high-end fight break out, which only looks set to grow. Any large-scale conflict with China is expected to involve prosecuting tens of thousands of targets just in the opening stages. Ongoing crises in and around the Red Sea and elsewhere in the Middle East, as well as U.S. support for Ukraine, have already highlighted concerns about existing munitions stockpiles and the size of the existing industrial base to produce them. What ETVs might get picked for scaled-up production remains to be seen, the program is now set to push ahead faster thanks to Replicator.

Taiwan Experts On Chances Of Chinese Invasion Under New Trump Adm...	Among the many foreign policy decisions Donald Trump will have to make in his new administration will be what to do about Taiwan and the looming threat from China. The U.S. government maintains a doctrine of strategic ambiguity toward Taiwan to keep China second-guessing about how Washington might respond to an attack on the island. It technically has a 'One-China Policy' that has, since 1979, formally recognizes the regime in Beijing and not the one in Taipei. At the same time, the U.S. reserves the right to engage with Taiwanese officials and support the island’s military until its final status has been conclusively resolved. These long-time norms are increasingly being challenged as China has stepped up its belligerence toward the island, located just roughly 100 miles across the Taiwan Strait. The island nation is located about 100 miles southeast of the Chinese mainland. (Google Earth image) Beijing has staged progressively larger and more threatening military exercises around Taiwan. These large force drills are increasingly showcasing Beijing's ability to blockade the island and strike at it from all sides. To get a sense of how the new Trump administration could confront the increasingly perilous issue of the standoff between China and Taiwan, we asked six experts in Beijing-Taipei relations for their thoughts. Our participating subject matter experts are: Simona Alba Grano, Senior Lecturer at the University of Zurich and Director of the Taiwan Studies Project there. Ja Ian Chong, Associate Professor in the Department of Political Science, National University of Singapore and a Non-Resident Scholar, Carnegie China. Roger Huang, Lecturer Department of Security Studies and Criminology at Australia's Macquaire University. Fang-Yu Chen, assistant professor of Political Science at Soochow University, Taiwan, where his research includes US-China-Taiwan relations. Claire Chu, senior China analyst at Janes in Washington and nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub. Kitsch Liao, Assistant Director, Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub. We sent this impressive group the same questions independently so their responses could be as direct and unfiltered as possible. Here they are in full, though some questions and answers have been slightly edited for clarity. Do you see any change in U.S. policy toward Taiwan from the Biden administration to the Trump administration? Simona Alba Grano: Unlike U.S. President Joe Biden, Trump is likely to focus more on bilateral relationships than multilateral groupings. He will most probably exit several international organizations and treaties, leaving allies alone, which will be positive for China. Rather than considering Taiwan as a democracy worth protecting in its own right, Taiwan is now a card to be played in Trump's transactional strategies, which at this point are not yet fully clear. Ja Ian Chong: I guess a key thing people will be watching out for is whether and if so, how, the new Trump administration will have Taiwan 'pay' more for its defense, or if Trump decides to punish Taiwan for what he calls 'stealing' the US semiconductor business despite the fact this has no factual basis. A more hawkish US administration could also lead to more friction around Taiwan, which the Taiwanese may be wary about. Roger Huang: It is too early to tell how US-Taiwan relations will change under a Trump administration, although they will inevitably change. There are some telling signs. Trump has already excluded [Former U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki] Hailey and [Former Trump Secretary of State Mike] Pompeo from any roles in his administration. Both prominent former Trump officials have visited Taiwan relatively recently and are quite popular American political figures in the 'Green' camp. [Elon] Musk’s seemingly oversized role/influence in the new Trump administration may lead to some internal contradictions and disagreements within the Trump cabinet. Musk has significant interest in China. He has also previously said that Taiwan should accept a '1 country 2 systems' formula- Hong Kong style, even at the expense of Taiwan’s current freedom and democracy. On the other hand, [U.S. Sen. Marco] Rubio [nominated to be Secretary of State] is a well-known China hawk, who is on the record as very supportive of Taiwan and an advocate for more arms sales to Taiwan. Fang-Yu Chen: One of the most important achievements of the Biden administration is the 'internationalization of the Taiwan Strait issue,' addressing it through multilateral mechanisms. Also, the Biden administration tries very hard to rally allies to contain China. The Trump administration, on the other hand, might focus more on bilateral approaches and placed relatively less emphasis on multilateral organizations such as the [Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity] IPEF, the US-Japan-Korea alliance, and the Chip 4 Alliance [between the United States, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, with the aim of creating a more secure global semiconductor supply chain]. U.S. support for Taiwan will continue, as will sanctions against China, but there are likely to be some adjustments in the approach. Claire Chu: The incoming administration may be more willing to challenge the status quo relationship with China and Taiwan. Beijing has been upping the ante, escalating its use of deliberate pressure tactics to constrain Taiwan’s decision-making space and enforce Taiwan’s diplomatic isolation while building up its own capabilities. Chinese leadership could expect a more offensive posture from Washington that trends away from 'measured' and towards 'open' competition. Kitsch Liao: Policy bedrock unchanged: Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) [legislation to help maintain peace, security, and stability in the Western Pacific and to promote continued extensive, close, and friendly relations between the people of the United States and Taiwanese], Three Communiques [joint communiques issued by the United States and China in 1972, 1979, and 1982 that continue to serve as the foundation for U.S.-China relations] and Six Assurances [guidelines in conducting United States - Taiwan relations]. This means the U.S. has committed to, in accordance with TRA, maintain the capacity to resist China’s coercion [NOTE: lots of grey area, and Beijing plays in the grey] and invasion of Taiwan, and provide Taiwan with defensive weapons, but not commit to an intervention. Variable is on how the Trump administration sees what constitutes 'arms of a defensive character' suitable to provide to Taiwan, and how the administration will interpret what is sufficient capacity for the U.S. to maintain in order to 'resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or social or economic system, of the people of Taiwan.' Strategic ambiguity: strategic ambiguity, originally known as 'duel deterrence,' is a policy that can be dictated by POTUS. Biden was clear that he will intervene; some think this is helpful but others don’t. Trump’s deal-making nature makes this more ambiguous and will be perceived in the region as such.

(Photo by FRED DUFOUR/AFP via Getty Images) FRED DUFOUR What about the flow of arms from the U.S. to Taiwan? Simona Alba Grano: Trump’s return to the White House means first and foremost a lot of uncertainties for Taiwan going forward, given that the U.S. remains the island's most important international security guarantor, legally bound to provide it with defensive weapons. Given some recent comments by Trump, his return could mean that Taiwan will be required to pay more for its defense and if it does not, arms sales will be slowed down. Ja Ian Chong: At least in the short term, there could be arms sales. However, whether this situation persists may be more difficult to anticipate. Then apart from sales, there is the question of delivery. The Biden administration was allegedly slow on some deliveries. This situation may ease if the Trump administration no longer prioritizes Ukraine, but then again it may not. Roger Huang: It is likely that U.S. arms sales to Taiwan will not only continue but increase. Taiwan will likely be pressured by the Trump administration to increase its defense budget. We know that in Trump’s thinking, many U.S. allies are 'free riding' U.S. defense/military commitments. We would most likely see the U.S. wanting to see Taiwan increase its defense budget by several percentage points to demonstrate Taiwan’s seriousness in building up its self-defense capability. Fang-Yu Chen: The U.S. arms sales to Taiwan will definitely continue. According to the classified memo of the President established during the Reagan administration, which was later declassified by John Bolton, the U.S. arms sales to Taiwan are based on the level of threat posed by the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA). Since China's threat will only grow stronger and the U.S. national interest lies in maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific region, the U.S. will continue to keep the so-called status quo and stability of the region. U.S. arms sales to Taiwan will persist. The key issue should be discussing how much Taiwan can acquire and the strategy of defense and system of the weaponry. So far, the appointments in the new administration have all involved individuals who recognize China as a significant threat to U.S. national security. They are even more likely to support Taiwan's military defense. Claire Chu: There will likely be continuity with U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, but it will run parallel to conversations about Taiwan’s self-defense progress. Kitsch Liao: There are two parts, the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) portion, and the more recent direct transfer under the Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA). FMS: Established, relatively stable annual process including the annual Monterey Talk [designed to sync interagency discussions and examine all-of-government security issues such as crisis response scenarios, security cooperation, and resilience] to hammer out acquisition priority. Taiwan service interest potentially on the rise, as Army, Navy, and Air Force contemplating individual big-ticket items. Some in apparent contradiction to the established, porcupine-style Overall Defense Concept (ODC). There are debates ongoing between U.S. and Taiwan about what sort of strategy makes the best sense; however administration shift unlikely to have a big impact; there’s also strong support from Congress for continued arms sales. Delays in FMS delivery may still persist, as the issue concerns U.S. bureaucratic capacity to process large and complex acquisitions. PDA: PDAs arguably constitute a more important portion of strengthening Taiwan’s defense in the near term. On top of the direct transfer of military equipment, some of the crucial training and assessments on the ground in Taiwan right now are supported through this authorization. The PDA is crucial in building Taiwan up to pose sufficient conventional deterrence before 2027, when PLA would be a 'basically modern' force, and capable but not guaranteed to win an invasion of Taiwan. By its very nature, PDA is more sensitive to the administration’s whims and thus there’s greater uncertainty surrounding its continuation. Taiwan is lining up to become the next customer for the combat-proven National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System or NASAMS air defense system, after the United States approved its sale to the country in October. (RTX) Is the U.S. more or less likely to come to Taiwan’s assistance in the event of a Chinese invasion under the new administration? Simona Alba Grano: On one side, the rising U.S.-China competition continues to increase Taiwan’s strategic importance in the U.S.-dominated 'first island chain.' That, coupled with its economic importance as the world supplier of advanced semiconductors makes it unlikely that Trump will sacrifice Taiwan completely, especially considering that Congress in the U.S. has always been and will continue to be predominantly close to Taiwan. On the other hand, as stated above his transactional nature and unpredictability make it very difficult to predict what Trump could do in the long run. Ja Ian Chong: I think the jury is out on this one. A lot will depend on how the U.S.-PRC relationship as well as the U.S.-Taiwan relationship pans out. That said, the previous Trump presidency suggests toughness on economic matters but less clear resolve on military issues. Roger Huang: Given the increasingly isolationist mood in the U.S., it remains to be seen how Trump would respond to Chinese adventurism. Fang-Yu Chen: Verbal statements and commitments might decrease, as Mr. Trump has already stated that he is unwilling to make direct promises, believing that doing so is unfavorable for negotiations. For Trump, everything is transactional. However, the support and commitments from Trump administration officials toward Taiwan are unlikely to diminish. In Taiwan, the ruling party remains the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), so its policy toward the U.S. will not change. It will continue to strengthen U.S.-Taiwan relations and push forward military reforms. In the short term, Taiwan will continue to demonstrate its determination for self-defense, making it unlikely for the U.S. position to shift. Claire Chu: Ongoing armed conflicts in multiple theaters may strain U.S. forces’ Pacific readiness, raising the question of ability. An increasingly war-weary American public may raise the question of will. But the U.S. commitment to Taiwan’s defense has been underpinned by enduring bipartisan interest for decades and is not likely to change under the new administration. Kitsch Liao: Beijing watched and learned from what Russia did wrong during the initial failure in Ukraine. Consequently, China is more likely to gradually escalate, a 'frog boiling in water' situation. Critical need would be rallying allies and partners together, and that will be harder for the incoming administration. PRC has U.S. action priced in. What they don’t have priced in is what U.S. allies would do—that is what can change Beijing’s calculus mid-stream. Should Beijing launch an all-out invasion, overall uncertainty increases for all scenarios concerned, even the ones where the U.S. traditionally would consider not to intervene. Because even the Congressionally mandated TRA took pains to ensure any administration would have the liberty to interpret and act on any given Taiwan Strait situation as it sees fit, and the communiques and assurances are policy decisions that can easily be overruled by POTUS.

(N509FZ via Wikimedia) Is China more or less likely to invade during the Trump administration? Simona Alba Grano: At this point it is impossible to predict as it is too early to see what Trump will do, so I have left [the question] unanswered. Ja Ian Chong: I do not think the likelihood of an invasion scenario changes. Overall, the chances of invasion are lower than a blockade, which is lower than the continued use of grey zone tactics to wear Taiwan down. Invasion may be risky and expensive for Beijing as well, especially when there seem to be cheaper and less risky options. I can see Beijing stepping up grey zone operations and coercion, however. That may increase the risk of escalation. An invasion may take place if the PRC for some reason believes that it is both cheap and easy. Roger Huang: I don’t see a full-on Chinese invasion as a likely scenario in the near future. The bigger worry is the incremental erosion of Taiwanese sovereignty and active control of its territories. PRC’s ramping up of its military exercises near Taiwanese territory, including the PLA’s dismissal of the de facto median line and intrusion in Taiwan’s restricted/prohibited waters near Kinmen and Matsu will have longer-term implications (and therefore higher chance of a more militarily aggressive China). Fang-Yu Chen: In the short term, China will certainly use various methods to test the Trump administration's limits while taking advantage of the transition period for personnel appointments to prepare for potential future trade wars. During this time, gray zone warfare is likely to increase, but the likelihood of a direct military invasion remains low. China's current economic situation is dire, leaving it without sufficient resources for large-scale military operations, and such actions would pose excessively high risks for its leadership. Claire Chu: From my perspective, China is not in a hurry to attempt a forceful takeover of Taiwan – at least, not until a quick decisive victory is guaranteed. Instead, China is likely to continue testing the waters, quite literally, while ramping up its gray zone aggression toward Taiwan – for which the U.S. has never articulated a red line – before assessing its options based on the Trump administration’s reaction. But also, China has and will continue to employ a multitude of coercive, non-kinetic measures against Taiwan that are intended to chip away at its international legitimacy, cyber resilience, information environment, national identity, and credible will for self-defense – all without firing a shot. That’s what I’m more concerned about. Kitsch Liao: This one is impossible to call. This is going to be a Xi Jinping call, and the question is what impacts Xi’s calculus and in what direction, and this may very well depend on Xi himself and his personal interaction with Trump, much of which we won’t see. There are two big scenarios: Opportunistic: China may see an opening should Xi believe Taiwan’s conventional deterrence is lacking, or influence operation has matured on the ground, and launch an invasion to take advantage. The less predictable nature of the Trump administration’s reaction to a Chinese aggressive action toward Taiwan creates more risks in the mind of a Chinese planner, which increases the barrier for any opportunistic move against Taiwan. Forced hand: Xi sees game-changing moves from Taiwan or the U.S. that threaten the CCP’s ruling legitimacy in ways that demand a response. In other words, China will invade Taiwan when Xi lost the ability to credibly claim that Taiwan will 'eventually' be unified with China, therefore any gesture and messaging from the oncoming administration, whether intentional or not, that would lead to Xi or the politburo to such conclusion would increase that likelihood.

North Korean Long-Range Self-Propelled Artillery Appears In Russi...	A photo has emerged showing examples of a North Korean-made self-propelled artillery system under transport in Russia, the clearest suggestion so far that Pyongyang is also now providing Moscow with these kinds of heavyweight, far-reaching artillery weapons for its war in Ukraine. That would hardly be a surprise at this point, with North Korea having supplied Russia with huge amounts of weaponry already, including millions of artillery rounds, as well as having committed to the deployment of thousands of troops for the conflict. I was able to geolocate and thus confirm that the photo of North Korean M-1978/1989 Koksan 170mm SPGs was taken in Russia.56.069386, 92.920244Krasnoyarsk, central Russia pic.twitter.com/LUHO2cllKZ&mdash; Status-6 (Military & Conflict News) (BlueSky too) (@Archer83Able) November 14, 2024 The photo in question appeared on social media today, apparently first being posted to the Russian Telegram messaging app. It shows at least two examples of the 170mm M1989 Koksan self-propelled artillery units being transported on a flatbed railcar. Open-source intelligence analysts later geolocated this precisely to Krasnoyarsk, in central Russia. Notable is the fact the vehicles have white-painted roadwheels, a feature often seen on North Korean equipment during high-profile parades. North Korea’s Koksan self-propelled artillery system was first fielded sometime in the late 1970s, as the M1978. The full Western designation indicates that it was first noted by intelligence agencies in 1978 in the city of Koksan. An example of the original M1978 Koksan, in Iranian service. Siamak Ebrahimi/Tasnim News The original M1978 is based on an adapted Type 59 tank, fitted with a 170mm caliber artillery cannon, mounted in an open superstructure, rather than a protected turret. The M1989 version, as seen in the photo from Krasnoyarsk, uses the same gun but mounted on a more modern chassis, similar in appearance to that used on Russia’s 2S7 Pion, a 203mm self-propelled artillery piece. The M1989 version also has onboard storage for 12 rounds of ammunition. The main advantage of the M1978/M1989 is its long range, with the big 170mm gun assessed as capable of firing a standard shell to a range of around 25 miles, or a rocket-assisted shell to a range of 37 miles. For a long time, the weapon was judged to be the longest-range conventional artillery piece in North Korean service. An M1989 Koksan on parade during North Korea Victory Day celebrations in July 2013. Stefan Krasowski/Wikimedia Commons Picasa Downsides include no ability to carry the gun crew, who have to be transported separately, and the lack of any armored protection for the crew once the gun is set up and in operation. Also, the rate of fire is incredibly slow by modern standards, just two rounds every five minutes. The German-made PzH 2000 self-propelled howitzer, also used by Ukraine, can fire 10 rounds per minute or a three-round burst in 10 seconds. For Russia, there is also the issue that the M1989 uses 170mm ammunition, something that it doesn’t have in its own stocks, and which is, on a global scale, a relatively rare caliber. On the other hand, North Korea has plenty of ammunition that it could potentially supply. It’s worth noting, too, that the M1978/M1989 is very much a known quantity to Western analysts. The weapon was exported to Iran and employed extensively in the Iran-Iraq War, some examples being captured and used by Iraq. The 2003 invasion of Iraq provided the U.S. military a chance to look at some of these weapons at close quarters. A former Iranian M1978 Koksan captured by U.S. Marines in Ramadi, Iraq, in November 2008. U.S. Marine Corps photo by Lance Cpl. Albert F. Hunt/Released LCpl Albert F. Hunt We don’t know for sure at this point why the M1989 Koksan guns were in Russia, but there are several possible explanations. They could be in Russia for test purposes, or even some kind of maneuvers involving North Korean troops. Perhaps most likely, the guns could be headed to Ukraine, where Russia will use them to bolster its own self-propelled artillery units. Finally, bearing in mind the increasing involvement of North Korean troops fighting for Russia, these weapons could also be headed to Ukraine, or the Kursk region of Russia, for use by Pyongyang’s own forces. North Korea has huge quantities of Koksan and other large-caliber artillery, and Russia has been burning through its own stocks of such weapons, with questions about its war industry’s ability to replace them with the required urgency.

Berezowski/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images Anadolu There are also more than enough precedents for Russia wanting to acquire heavy weapons from North Korea, with long-range ones being of particular value. According to data from the Oryx open-source tracking group, at least 851 pieces of Russian self-propelled artillery have been destroyed, damaged, abandoned, or captured. The actual number is likely far higher as Oryx only tabulates losses that are visually confirmed using open-source materials. Already, Pyongyang’s support for Moscow’s war in Ukraine has seen the supply of a diverse range of weapons, including millions of badly needed artillery rounds and various kinds of other ammunition. A recent assessment from the South Korean National Intelligence Service (NIS), based on intelligence provided by the Ukrainian Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR), listed North Korean weapons collected from the battlefield, including claimed '122mm and 152mm shells, Bulsae-4 anti-tank missiles, short-range ballistic missiles such as the KN-23, and RPG anti-tank rockets.'

As well as suggestions that Pyongyang might receive new Russian combat aircraft to overhaul its badly aging air force, there have also been concerns that Moscow might provide it with technologies to help accelerate its nuclear and long-range ballistic missile programs.

Degtyaryov/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images We may not have to wait long to see who ends up using the M1989 Koksan self-propelled artillery units in Ukraine — if indeed that’s where they’re headed. If they do end up at the front, whether used by Russian or North Korean forces, it would be bad news for Ukraine, which is already at a large artillery deficit compared to Russia.

Giant Uncrewed Submarine Put Forward By Chinese Shipbuilder, Poss...	A concept for an unprecedently large diesel-electric drone submarine, as big as some crewed types in service today, has emerged from China's top state-run shipbuilding conglomerate. The design is said to be reconfigurable to conduct different missions, including attacks on enemy vessels, mine-laying, special operations support, and act as a mothership for smaller uncrewed underwater vehicles (UUV). There is a very strong possibility this is related to an extremely similar-looking mystery submarine that emerged in China six years ago. The China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC) has a model of what it is calling a 'small special operations unmanned submarine' on display at this year's Zhuhai Airshow. The event, which formally opened on Tuesday, is a military-centric showcase for Chinese aviation, as well as ground-based and maritime developments. 701所の小型無人特殊潜水艦例のセイルが無い潜水艦の正体はこれか。ただ小型とは言いつつも軽く2、30mはあるであろうUUVとしてはかなり大型の艦になる。艦中央部は極めて大容量のバッテリーとして、同じく中央部の黄色いユニットはUUVか短魚雷か。 pic.twitter.com/ArEL6eZHJI&mdash; お砂糖wsnbn (@sugar_wsnbn) November 10, 2024 The model shows a relatively traditional submarine design hull-wise, but with a very low-profile dorsal hump in place of a traditional sail. The model is a cut-away and a load of torpedoes, as well as a torpedo tube, is visible. A large central battery array, propulsion system elements driving a single unshrouded propeller at the stern, and other mission systems in the bow are also present. There is also a large collapsible mast at the rear, which is a typical feature on larger UUVs, including the Orca that Boeing is developing for the U.S. Navy. Pictures said to show a CSSC product card available at Zhuhai, seen in the social media post below, indicate the model reflects a 'Type A' configuration capable of carrying between eight and 12 torpedos and/or torpedo tube-launched missiles. A Type B variant that could accommodate six to eight special operations divers and their gear and a Type C version able to carry eight to 12 mines or 'small' UUVs (or four 'large' UUVs) are also mentioned. 小型無人特殊潜水艦の詳細高い機動性と魚雷,機雷,UUV,ダイバーなど多様なペイロードを搭載可。用途に応じA,B,C型3タイプを用意。全長:38-43m排水量:380-450t潜航深度:300-450m最高速力:20kt巡航:8kt航続距離水中連続:6ktで1000-3000nmtotal:6ktで10000nm動力:400kw LFPバッテリー＋DE発電機 pic.twitter.com/pFubbByWUt&mdash; お砂糖wsnbn (@sugar_wsnbn) November 13, 2024 Depending on the version and loadout, the product card says the drone submarine's overall length is between around 124 and 141 feet (38 and 43 meters) and its surfaced displacement is between 380 and 450 tons. The design will be able to dive down to depths of (300 to 450 meters), as well as sail at a maximum speed of 20 knots and cruise at eight knots while on the surface, according to CSSC. Its underwater cruising speed is pegged at six knots. Stated maximum continuous underwater and surfaced ranges of 3,000 nautical miles and 10,000 nautical miles, respectively, both while traveling at a steady speed of six knots, are given on the card, as well. For comparison, the German-made Type 206 crewed diesel-electric attack submarine (SSK) is (48.6 meters) long and has a surfaced displacement of 450 tons. The German Navy retired the very last of its Type 206s in 2011, but examples continue to serve with the Colombian Navy. CSSC's 'small' drone submarine is also larger than some crewed midget submarines in global service, such as North Korea's (34 meter) long, 370-ton surfaced displacement Sang-O-class. A pair of decommissioned German Type 206 submarines. Tvabutzku1234 via Wikimedia A North Korean Sang-O-class submarine that South Korea captured in 1996 now on display in the latter country. Idobi via Wikimedia As another point of comparison, the initial prototype of Boeing's aforementioned Orca, which is typically categorized as an 'extra-large' UUV (XLUUV), is around 85 feet long and has a displacement of around 85 tons while on the surface. The Orca is a modular design and initial operational versions are already set to be longer and have greater displacements due to their school bus-sized payload sections. The initial Orca XLUUV prototype, at right, and one with the additional payload section, at left. Boeing What degree of autonomy CSSC might be envisioning for its new drone submarine design is unclear, but the product card describes the ability for human controllers to interface with the submarine via beyond-line-of-sight satellite communications and/or underwater acoustic links. The mast seen on the model would be key to sending and receiving data. More robust autonomy would be required for some of the proposed mission sets. No explicit mention is made on the product card of any particular features to reduce the design's acoustic or other signatures. As already noted, the model shows the design's single propeller to be unshrouded. A large and long-endurance drone submarine of this kind could be highly useful though for many missions, depending on its ability to operate autonomously, both in littoral areas around Chinese-controlled territory and further out to sea. The drone submarines could be used to form an underwater picket line in a particular area for extended periods of time. This, in turn, would also allow Chinese forces to increase the submarine threat in that zone and otherwise bolster operational capacity, including in cooperation with crewed fleets, and do so at lower cost. Submarines, in general, also offer valuable platforms for conducting intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions, and doing so discreetly. Just knowing that some number of these very large UUVs are out there, even if they are not overly difficult to detect by submarine standards, could be a complication for opponents, who would still have to devote resources to find them and at least track their movements. A US Navy P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol plane drops sonobouys. Elbit Systems of America The CSSC product card also explicitly mentions the potential for the drone submarines to support blockade operations, something authorities in Beijing routinely threaten to do to the island of Taiwan and that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) actively trains for. The Type B configuration is also clearly intended to support special operations raids. It's interesting to note here that Taiwan state-owned National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST) and the island's Lungteh Shipbuilding have also been working on a new larger UUV design equipped with a pair of torpedo tubes. You can read more about the Huilong, or 'Smart Dragon,' which is still notably smaller than CSSC's new drone submarine concept, here. Military enthusiasts have captured photos of Taiwan’s domestically developed 'Huilong' unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) with torpedo tubes, revealing potential combat capabilities. pic.twitter.com/uBZ3AAGbCN&mdash; TaiwanPlus News (@taiwanplusnews) October 24, 2024 All that being said, it is unclear how advanced any work on this ambitious drone submarine concept may be and how much progress, if any, there has been toward making it an operational reality. There are signs, however, that CSSC may have already made substantial headway on this design or a closely related one. In 2018, JN shipyard, a CSSC subsidiary, launched a previously unseen submarine design. A screen capture from a video that emerged the following year confirmed that it had a very low-profile dorsal hump in lieu of a typical sail. Independent naval analyst H. I. Sutton has estimated the design to be around 150 feet (45 meters) long based on available pictures, videos, and satellite imagery, which would be in line with the design CSSC has now displayed in model form. A picture of the still mysterious submarine JN Shipyard launched in 2018. Chinese Internet A top-down look at the submarine from JN Shipyard with its very low profile sail. Chinese Internet It has been pointed out that there are certain differences between the drone submarine model at Zhuhai and the real low-profile-sail-equipped submarine, including in the shape and position of the diving planes. At the same time, it's not uncommon for models to differ significantly from their real-world counterparts, as was just recently seen with the JARI-USV-A uncrewed surface vessel that also made its public debut at Zhuhai this year and that you can read more about here. Like the JARI-USV-A, the mysterious submarine from JN shipyard could also still be more of a testbed intended to help lay the groundwork for future operational designs.

The People's Liberation Army (PLA) continues to make significant strides in actually fielding drone capabilities across all domains. The PLA Navy is also continuing to expand the size and scope of its crewed surface and underwater fleets with increasingly more advanced and capable designs. This is backed by massive domestic shipbuilding capacity that has increasingly prompted concerns among Western navies, including the U.S. Navy. Time will ultimately tell whether or not CSSC's drone submarine model at Zhuhai evolved into an operational capability, but there are signs that active work on the design maybe underway already.

SB>1 Defiant High-Speed Helicopter Put To Rest In A Museum	Sikorsky and Boeing's medium-lift, high-speed, compound-coaxial helicopter that aimed to replace large numbers of Black Hawks has been donated to a museum. The SB>1 Defiant's final resting place is at the Army Aviation Museum at Fort Novosel in Alabama. Sikorsky tells The War Zone in a statement that 'Upon completion of SB>1 DEFIANT’s contractual commitments to the Army on the FLRAA [Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft] program, the Sikorsky-Boeing team offered to donate the aircraft to the Army Aviation Museum at Fort Novosel where it is now scheduled to be proudly displayed alongside many other historical aircraft.' Video of the SB>1 being rolled onto the museum floor was posted last week: The SB>1 Defiant lost the Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft tender to a design based on Bell's V-280 Valor next-generation tiltrotor nearly two years ago. It was a very high-stakes competition, our analysis of the results of which you can read here. A subsequent protest by the Sikorsky-Boeing team over the selection of the V-280 didn't change the outcome. After the loss, it wasn't exactly clear what would come of the SB>1 demonstrator or the design overall, but at this point it is clear that the airframe will not continue to be used in any testing and will be put on permanent display. That's not to say that the X2 technology that Sikorsky has developed over two decades will be put on the shelf, even though another blow to it came when the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) program, which aimed to supply the Army with a high-speed new-generation scout and attack helicopter, was cancelled earlier this year. Sikorsky's promising RaiderX, which was based on the company's S-97 Raider demonstrator, was seen by some as a potential frontrunner for that tender. The Raider used X2 technology, with the Defiant being an enlarged manifestation of the general concept. Still, the S-97 continues on and there is interest in it for a number of roles internationally, as well as continued development domestically. Sikorsky laid out the continuing efforts related to its X2 technology to us as follows: 'We are seeing a number of opportunities across the globe for X2 aircraft, which includes interest in Korea and Europe. With the NATO Next Generation Rotorcraft Capability (NGRC) Program, our X2 aircraft will bring to bear the strengths of Lockheed Martin along with input from our European Industry Group, such as digital thread, advanced manufacturing, sustainment, training, and weapon and mission system development, to provide NATO with an integrated rotorcraft system that combines speed, range, maneuverability, survivability and operational flexibility.' 'Also, we continue to reduce risk for Army Aviation through the maturation of technologies we developed for U.S. Army Future Vertical Lift programs, which are also applicable to the next-generation modernized Black Hawk – such as MOSA, Launched Effects and Autonomy. For example, we continue to partner with the government to provide data benefitting current and future Army Aviation development efforts. After full integration of the Army’s ITE [Improved Turbine Engine] onto RAIDER X, we successfully lit off the engine this past April. This represents the first on wing operation of the ITE and the 4th evolution of X2 rotorcraft.' 'U.S. Army funded X2 engineering risk reduction flights on S-97 RAIDER are scheduled through mid-2025.' A Raider variant depicted in the troop transport/multi-role configuration. Image courtesy Sikorsky, a Lockheed Martin Company The Raider's speed — upwards of 220 knots — as well as its agility and hot and high performance, all packed in a relatively small footprint, really provide an unmatched capability. It has been flying for nearly a decade with a lot of risk reduction already baked into the system. It can carry up to six troops and two pilots, or weapons that pop out from its cabin area. So there are a lot of applications and flexibility for the type. It will be interesting to see if it can find a buyer. The optionally manned capability could be even more attractive and this is an area where Sikorsky is making major strides. There was also some talk about the S-97 being potentially adopted by U.S. Army Special Operations Command, possibly to replace at least part of the MH-6/AH-6 Little Bird fleet, but that chatter seems to have died down and discussions of what will replace the Little Birds have changed significantly in recent months. Regardless, it is sad to see Defiant go. It was an impressive-looking machine. At least people will be able to check it out close-up for years to come at its new home at Fort Novosel.

Mobile Launcher That Can Fire Four Times As Weapons As HIMARS Eme...	A new palletized ground-based launcher concept that can be loaded with up to two dozen 227mm guided artillery rockets at a time – four times what an M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) can pack at once – recently broke cover. The launch system is designed to be carried on a 10-wheeled cargo truck and can also fire other weapons, including short-range ballistic missiles and surface-to-air interceptors. Lockheed Martin displayed the launcher on a U.S. Marine Corps 10&#215;10 MKR18 Logistics Vehicle System Replacement (LVSR) truck at the Human-Machine Integration Summit IV last week. U.S. Army's Futures Command hosted the event at Texas A&M University’s George H.W. Bush Combat Development Complex (BCDC). More&#8230;&#8230; pic.twitter.com/TgGu9XZAz5&mdash; 笑脸男人 (@lfx160219) November 8, 2024 The LSVR is very similar, but not identical to the Army's 10&#215;10 M1075 Palletized Load System (PLS) truck. Oshkosh Defense manufactures both vehicles, which evolved from the . A Marine MKR18 LVSR truck with a more typical payload (a shipping container). USMC 'This Lockheed Martin proof-of-concept configuration demonstrates how a logistics vehicle in the field can rapidly transition to a launcher delivering a deep magazine of GMLRS, ATACMS or PrSM,' a company spokesperson told The War Zone. The 227mm Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) family of 227mm precision-guided artillery rockets, along with the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) and Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) short-range ballistic missiles, are all Lockheed Martin products. The company collectively refers to them as the MLRS Family of Munitions (MFOM). Members of the MFOM all come in standardized ammunition 'pods,' which can hold six GMLRS rockets, two PrSMs, or a single ATACMS. The wheeled M142 HIMARS can be loaded with one of these pods at a time, while tracked M270 MLRS launch vehicles can carry two at once.

Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin A HIMARS launcher fires an ATACMS missile. US Army A US Army HIMARS launcher fires an ATACMS missile. US Army Whether any other munitions might already be compatible with the new launcher concept is unclear. Follow-on variants and derivates of the PrSM are already in active development for the Army. This includes a version with an additional seeker system that has a demonstrated capability to engage moving ships. There are also plans for a type with a maximum range of at least 1,000 kilometers (approximately 621 miles), which could incorporate an air-breathing propulsion system. The baseline PrSM has a range of at least 310 miles (500 kilometers), which could grow to 400 miles (650 kilometers) in the future. A PrSM is fired during a test. Lockheed Martin The new launcher concept 'may also be applied to Integrated Air Missile Defense interceptors,' the Lockheed Martin spokesperson did tell The War Zone, but provided no specific examples. Lockheed Martin is the manufacturer of the combat-proven PAC-3 series. The PAC-3 family is currently used in the Patriot surface-to-air missile system, but is also now being developed in a configuration compatible with Mk 41 Vertical Launch Systems (VLS). Variants and derivatives of the Mk 41, yet another part of Lockheed Martin's portfolio, are found on various U.S. and foreign warships, as well as in static and mobile ground-based configurations. A PAC-3 MSE interceptor seen being fired from a standard launcher used with the Patriot surface-to-air missile system. DOD A Patriot launcher fires a newer PAC-3-series missile during a test. DoD The latest PAC-3 MSE variant is said to be just over 17 feet long (5.3 meters) in length, which is notably longer than the MFOM pod form factor. The launch system shown at the recent Human-Machine Integration Summit does appear to have enough space to load longer weapons. PAC-3-series interceptors already offer greater magazine depth for the Patriot surface-to-air missile system using existing trailer-based launchers, as shown in this graphic. Lockheed Martin A graphic showing various Patriot launcher types and possible load configurations. Lockheed Martin There are surface-to-air interceptors from other companies that might also be options for use with this new launcher concept. For instance, the Army is in the process of acquiring the Enduring Shield system, which currently uses the AIM-9X Sidewinder as its primary interceptor. The service already wants to acquire another missile offering capability akin to the AIM-120D Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) for that system. The Marine Corps is also separately working to field a service-specific version of Israel's Iron Dome system and the Tamir interceptor that goes with it. It is also worth noting here that an LVSR-based launcher has been used in previous testing of the Operational Fires (OpFires) hypersonic missile, which is substantially larger than an MFOM pod. OpFires is a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) program. Lockheed Martin has been developing the missile, which is tipped with an unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicle, in cooperation with Northrop Grumman and Dynetics (a subsidiary of Leidos). A rendering of the LVSR-based OpFires launcher loaded with three of those hypersonic missiles. Lockheed Martin Altogether, Lockheed Martin says its new ground-based launcher concept offers a way 'to deploy offensive and defensive fires from the same platform and logistics footprint.' The palletized launcher does certainly offer more onboard magazine depth than HIMARS or MLRS on a mobile platform. It's unclear whether the launch system can be unloaded and employed from a static position on land or the deck of a ship, but this seems very plausible and could expand its overall flexibility. In an air and missile defense configuration, the launch system could also leverage emerging networking capabilities like the Army's Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS) to tie in with existing and future radars and other sensors. At the same time, a system that requires an LVSR-sized truck to move it around is by definition relatively large. HIMARS was notably developed specifically to provide MLRS-like capability, but in a package that was more readily deployable, especially by air via a C-130-sized aircraft. The value of the HIMARS' ability to conduct shoot-and-scoot operations and its general mobility have been on full display in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. HIMARS softening up Russian lines.

The Typhon system, also known as the Mid-Range Capability (MRC), includes trailer-based Mk 41 VLS-derived launchers capable of firing Tomahawk cruise missiles, as well as multi-purpose SM-6 missiles. A single Typhon launcher can be loaded with just four missiles at once. A group of four launchers, as well as a trailer-based command post, which form the core of a single Typhon system battery. US Army A full battery set of four Typhon launchers, as well as the trailer-based command post. US Army 'So, the Mid-Range Capability, we fielded it, we have put it into the theater, but we’re learning lessons on how we can improve the next evolutions of that,' Army Col. Michael Rose, commander of the 3rd Multi-Domain Task Force (MDTF) headquartered at Fort Shafter in Hawaii, said at the Association of the U.S. Army's (AUSA) main annual convention in October. 'How do we make it more mobile? How do we make it smaller? How do we make it more agile? How do we employ it most effectively and how do we sustain it? A lot of those lessons are feeding back into our RDT&E [research, development, test, and evaluations] and acquisitions professionals to improve and enhance that new operational capability.' The Army has also been experimenting with an uncrewed HIMARS derivative called the Autonomous Multi-domain Launcher (AML) with a particular focus on expanding ground-based stand-off strike capacity without significant additional manpower requirements. An uncrewed Autonomous Multi-domain Launcher (AML) fires a rocket during a test. US Army For its part, the Marine Corps is currently pushing ahead with fielding much smaller, remotely operated ground-based missile launchers derived from the 4&#215;4 Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) rather than systems based on larger platforms like the LVSR. This is part of an ongoing reorientation of the service's entire force structure around concepts of operations that focus heavily on the ability to relatively rapidly redeploy and redeploy forces from one forward location to another. Observations from the conflict in Ukraine have prompted significant new interest in the MFOM, especially in Europe, though still primarily paired with the lighter-weight HIMARS launcher. Lockheed Martin is also working with Germany's Rheinmetall on a new wheeled launcher, the Global Mobile Artillery Rocket System (GMARS), which can be loaded with two MFOM pods at a time. Lockheed Martin's new palletized launcher concept could still be attractive to the U.S. military for certain purposes, especially given its flexibility to be used for surface-to-surface strikes and air and missile defense, as well as allies and partners with different mobility and deployability requirements.

Flight Test Boss Details How China Threat Is Rapidly Changing Ope...	It is an incredible time to be involved in the world of U.S. Air Force flight-test. What we're doing right now is designed to innovate and accelerate our next generation of capability. We're modernizing so many of our weapon systems and many new technologies are all going through testing at the same time,' enthused Brig. Gen. Douglas 'Beaker' Wickert, commander of the 412th Test Wing at Edwards Air Force Base in California. 'Secretary Kendall has been very clear that we are out of time, that our Air Force has never been older or smaller than it is right now, and that the People’s Liberation Army has been specifically designed to defeat us.' 'The investments we're making right now in modernization and testing for the USAF are designed for success and aimed at changing Chairman Xi's calculus about pushing back aggressively against the international rules based order. What we are doing here and across USAF flight-testing is extremely consequential.' The installation at the heart of American military flight-testing for more than 80 years, known today as Edwards AFB, is located in California’s northwestern Mojave desert. This test center has witnessed pioneering advances in aviation since 1942, including a Golden Age in the 1950s that saw an exotic assortment of new military aircraft and X-planes under frantic development in the skies above this sprawling base. A B-1B Lancer from the Edwards AFB test fleet. Jamie Hunter Today, Edwards AFB is extremely busy as the resident 412th Test Wing supports multiple efforts to rapidly advance USAF capabilities. Just like on Oct. 14, 1947, when Charles E. 'Chuck' Yeager became the first human to exceed the speed of sound, or when William J. 'Pete' Knight flew the highly modified X-15A-2 on Oct. 3, 1967, to a top speed of Mach 6.72 (4,520 mph), going faster and higher than any other piloted winged vehicle other than the Space Shuttle, testing at Edwards stands at the bleeding edge of aviation innovation. Flying operations at Edwards today are complex and diverse and they include ushering in a new era of advanced autonomous uncrewed capabilities that make full use of emerging revolutions in technology, especially artificial intelligence (AI), as well as shepherding new aircraft like the B-21 Raider and T-7A Red Hawk into service. The War Zone sat down with Wickert in his office at Edwards for a detailed discussion covering some of the most important subjects that are impacting USAF flight-testing at this crucial time. USAF test empire Wickert began his USAF career as an F-16 pilot, and he has been involved in the military flight-test community for the past two decades, with many accolades including being a professor at the Air Force Academy. His role commanding the 412th Test Wing affords him an overarching, top down overview of all USAF testing. 'From here, you are afforded a really good vantage point to assess the state of the test world,' said Wickert. Brig. Gen. Wickert in his office at Edwards AFB. USAF CHLOE BONACCORSI The 412th Test Wing at Edwards and the 96th Test Wing at Eglin AFB, Florida, both sit under the umbrella of the Air Force Test Center, which is headed up by Maj. Gen. Scott Cain, and is also headquartered at Edwards. 'The test community is relatively small, on both the development test side and the partnering operational test side,' Wickert explained. 'We really have to keep our finger on the pulse to understand, with the finite resources that we have, how we facilitate the greatest return on investment, on time, and on our people. As we look at the work we expect to be running here over the next three years, we think we need as many as 1,600 new personnel to work here in our testing ecosystem. In addition to all of that, we need the right type and number of mission control rooms, chase aircraft, and tanker aircraft. We must balance those needs to make sure that we're moving everything through smoothly, and so when a system under test is not quite ready, we can rapidly reallocate resources where necessary to achieve success.' A new Boeing T-7A trainer on test at Edwards AFB. USAF Bryce Bennett While ensuring the correct physical assets are in place to meet demand, there’s also a pressure to evolve flight testing, which is traditionally an extremely laborious process, but essential in procedure to meet safety and capability targets. 'We are looking for opportunities to accelerate our testing,' said Wickert. 'Our test ecosystem consists of five key things. Firstly, there’s our ground resources, things like wind tunnels and high-speed test tracks, the Joint Simulation Environment [JSE], which is essentially a digital test and training resource.We also have flight resources, things like one-of-a-kind aircraft that are constructed with built-in string gauges and accelerometers to make them highly instrumented aircraft, so you know exactly what the system under test is doing, to include the mission systems. Then we have our instrumental ranges that we are working to tie together. Here we have a western range alliance, that’s the Pacific Test Ranges near Point Mugu, the Nevada Test and Training Range, and the R-2508 complex.' 'There’s also the data. Particularly now as systems are getting more and more complex, we take terabytes of data off of every single test. Finally, there’s the highly educated people that work here. We have the USAF Test Pilot School at Edwards, we have almost 1,000 engineers, flight-test engineers, these are a national resource in our test engineering group. This is our test ecosystem and each of those elements are ripe for innovative and creative ways to accelerate our testing, and it’s our responsibility to do that.' An F-22 and F-35A from the Edwards-based test fleet. USAF Kyle Larson Evolving USAF testing USAF leadership is looking at an aggressive timeline with regard to the fielding of new platforms such as Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCAs) amid what the Pentagon calls calls Great Power Competition. Wickert and his team are charged with ensuring the flight-test ecosystem is geared up for efficient means to push such new technologies effectively and efficiently through the rigorous testing that’s needed to field advanced new capabilities. 'Right now we’re at a point as generation AI is coming along and it's a really exciting time. We're experimenting with ways to use new tools across the entire test process, from test planning to test execution, from test analysis to test reporting. With investments from the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office [CDAO] we have approved under Control Unclassified Information [CUI] a large language model that resides in the cloud, on a government system, where we can input a test description for an item under test and it will provide us with a Test Hazard Analysis [THA]. It will initially provide 10 points, and we can request another 10, and another 10, etc, in the format that we already use. It’s not a finished product, but it's about 90% there.' 'When we do our initial test brainstorming, it’s typically a very creative process, but that can take humans a long time to achieve. It’s often about coming up with things that people hadn’t considered. Now, instead of engineers spending hours working on this and creating the administrative forms, the AI program creates all of the points in the correct format, freeing up the engineers to do what humans are really good at – thinking critically about what it all means.' 'So we have an AI tool for THA, and now we’ve expanded it to generate test cards from our test plans that we use in the cockpit and in the mission control rooms. It uses the same large language model but trained on the test card format. So we input the detailed test plan, which includes the method of the test, measures of effectiveness, and we can ask it to generate test cards. Rather than spending a week generating these cards, it takes about two minutes!' The X-62A takes off from Edwards AFB. Jamie Hunter Wickert says the Air Force Test Center is also blending its AI tooling into test reporting to enable rapid analysis and 'quick look' reports. For example, audio recordings of debriefs are now able to be turned into written reports. 'That's old school debriefs being coupled with the AI tooling to produce a report that includes everything that we talked about in the audio and it produces it in a format that we use,' explained Wickert. 'There's also the AI that’s under test, when the system under test is the AI, such as the X-62A VISTA [Variable-stability In-flight Simulator Test Aircraft]. VISTA is a sandbox for testing out different AI agents, in fact I just flew it and we did a BVR [Beyond Visual Range] simulated cruise missile intercept under the AI control, it was amazing. We were 20 miles away from the target and I simply pushed a button to engage the AI agent and then we continued hands off and it flew the entire intercept and saddled up behind the target. That's an example of AI under test and we use our normal test procedures, safety planning, and risk management all apply to that.' 'There’s also AI assistance to test. In our flight-test control rooms, if we're doing envelope expansion, flutter, or loads, or handling qualities – in fact we’re about to start high angle-of-attack testing on the Boeing T-7, for example – we have engineers sitting there watching and monitoring from the control room. The broad task in this case is to compare the actual handling against predictions from the models to determine if the model is accurate. We do this as incremental step ups in envelope expansion, and when the reality and the model start to diverge, that's when we hit pause because we don’t understand the system itself or the model is wrong. An AI assistant in the control room could really help with real-time monitoring of tests and we are looking at this right now. It has a huge impact with respect to digital engineering and digital material management.' 'I was the project test pilot on the Greek Peace Xenia F-16 program. One example of that work was that we had to test a configuration with 600-gallon wing tanks and conformal tanks, which equated to 22,000 pounds of gas on a 20,000-pound airplane, so a highly overloaded F-16. We were diving at 1.2 mach, and we spent four hours trying to hit a specific test point. We never actually managed to hit it. That’s incredibly low test efficiency, but you’re doing it in a very traditional way – here's a test point, go out and fly the test point, with very tight tolerances. Then you get the results and compare them to the model. Sometimes we do that real time, linked up with the control room, and it can typically take five or 10 minutes for each one. So, there's typically a long time between test points before the engineer can say that the predictions are still good, you're cleared to the next test point.' A heavily-instrumented F-16D returns to Edwards AFB after a mission. Jamie Hunter 'AI in the control room can now do comparison work in real time, with predictive analysis and digital modeling. Instead of having a test card that says you need to fly at six Gs plus or minus 1/10th of a G, at 20,000 feet plus or minus 400 feet pressure altitude, at 0.8 mach plus or minus 0.05, now you can just fly a representative maneuver somewhere around 20,000 feet and make sure you get through 0.8 mach and just do some rollercoaster stuff and a turn. In real time in the control room you're projecting the continuous data that you're getting via the aircraft’s telemetry onto a reduced order model, and that’s the product.' 'When Dr Will Roper started trumpeting digital engineering, he was very clear that in the old days we graduated from a model to test. In the new era of digital engineering, we graduate from tests to a validated model. That’s with AI as an assistant, being smarter about how we do tests, with the whole purpose of being able to accelerate because the warfighter is urgently asking for the capability that we are developing.' Collaborative Combat Aircraft One of the clearest areas the USAF is looking to accelerate surrounds Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCAs), a new family of unmanned combat drones that are designed to work in concert with manned fighters and provide a force multiplying, highly autonomous, numerical edge in tactical aerial warfare. The USAF faces an incredibly complex and laborious task when it comes to testing, training with, and fielding CCAs. 'We need to break the problem down, then we need to integrate all the pieces back together, and it has multiple components,' explained Wickert. 'There's the physical challenge of actually getting a CCA to fly. Does it have sufficient thrust? Do we have the right control laws? That's going to largely be contractor led. Separately, in parallel, we are developing the autonomous agents that will actually be the brains that can take some higher order commands and execute those, at varying levels of autonomy.' The General Atomics XQ-67A Off-Board Sensing Station is currently in flight-testing with the manufacturer and the Air Force Research Laboratory. General Atomics Edwards is planned as the USAF’s home of CCA flight-test, and work is commencing to build a new CCA enclave here. 'Once it's mature and it's ready for integration, it'll come up here and it will fly from here. We have to actually connect it with a crewed fighter. Those tests have to happen in open air because there's so many uncertainties, we will need to prove that it actually works in a real world environment. Then there's weapon integration, that'll be a separate effort.' In terms of validating how the CCAs will be employed, much of this modeling will be undertaken in the Joint Simulation Environment (JSE). 'Once we have good validated models of how the CCA will work, it's very easy to take those models and put them into the JSE. Every new program now has to be JSE-compatible and must be able to integrate into digital test. The JSE is not a simulator. There are simulators that plug into JSE, there's domes you can sit and fly, but the JSE is an architecture that’s perfect for prototyping, developing, and working out how you are actually going to employ.' 'The digital test range runs using the JSE. That’s where we will figure out if a single F-22 pilot can control four CCAs, is that the right number, maybe it's two, maybe it depends on the scenario. I've got a task, you've got a threat over there, I need the CCA to create a diversion. All of that will be worked out first in the digital test and training range.' A flight-test engineer engaged in an F-16D test flight. USAF 'I can easily imagine that F-22 and F-35 pilots will routinely train with CCAs, just like they routinely train with an AIM-120 or an AIM-9X missile without ever actually having the missile leave the aircraft. They will live fly and train with them synthetically around them in a live virtual constructive situation, so I can see how that would work with a tablet. The digital test and training range means we can look at all of these different scenarios, perhaps that’s a 2035 scenario, this is the concept of developing the analysis of alternatives. We can experiment and work out if we were to get say 30 of these new platforms, would it change the game?' High tempo operations While the synthetic JSE provides valuable modeling, prototyping and training, actually bringing together real aircraft in live fly test events is critical in proving that different capabilities actually work in the real world. Bringing together a wealth of different aircraft and new systems is a complex and costly affair, and therefore a quartet of large force test exercises has been developed. 'We run Orange Flag from Edwards, plus we have Emerald Flag at Eglin in Florida for the long-range kill and communications elements, we have the 53rd Wing’s Black Flag at Nellis AFB, and also Gray Flag for the Navy, that’s run out of Point Mugu. Some programs that are well funded allow us to bring together lots of different nodes and sensors to test the new capability. There are also less well funded projects that might want to join in and have the opportunity to work in a complex scenario like one of the flag exercises. So really it’s a case of we are throwing a party and you're invited to come, bring all of your latest and greatest stuff and let’s see what works. That includes Army land systems, Navy ships – the full range of advanced systems.' This B-2A is assigned to the Edwards AFB test fleet. USAF AFTC Aerial Photographer Christian Turner 'We are busier here at Edwards now than we were in the 1980s. We’re testing the USAF’s newest airplane, the B-21, and at the same time testing the B-52 and all of its new upgrades including new engines and new radar. The USAF’s new trainer, the T-7 Redhawk, is also being tested here, and many other things in between. We call Edwards the center of the aerospace testing universe, but it’s actually more than that, because it's more than just the USAF flight-test here.' 'It’s very easy to motivate folks because right now is a time of consequence. If you want to know what the USAF of 2027 or 2035 or 2042 looks like, just look in the skies over Edwards Air Force Base because the Air Force that’s flying over Edwards is the Air Force that we're going to go to war with.'

Gray Eagle STOL Drone Flies From South Korean Amphibious Assault ...	The General Atomics Aeronautical Systems (GA-ASI) Gray Eagle STOL drone has undertaken its first experimental operations from a warship, taking off from the deck of the South Korean amphibious assault ship Dokdo. The Gray Eagle STOL — a design we have discussed in depth in the past — incorporates technology first demonstrated on the company’s Mojave, which was specifically developed with the ability to perform short takeoffs and landings, including from rough fields, with minimal support. The latest development adds to the aviation-capable warships that the wider family of Q-1 lineage drones have now operated from. Yesterday, Gray Eagle STOL launched from the ROK helicopter ship Dokdo (deck length, 653ft/199m).GE STOL gets up so quick, we might launch it off surfboards next. pic.twitter.com/H8GUuzQPLT&mdash; C. Mark Brinkley (@cmarkbrinkley) November 13, 2024 The Republic of Korea Navy (ROKN) confirmed the test took place yesterday, November 12, in the East Sea — the South Korean name for the Sea of Japan. Officials confirmed that this was the first time that a fixed-wing drone of any kind operated from an ROKN vessel. The Gray Eagle STOL drone came aboard the Dokdo disassembled and was then reassembled and tested for a week, before taking off from the deck of the vessel. The drone flew for roughly one hour, before landing at a Naval Air Command facility in Pohang, around 170 miles southeast of Seoul. The ROKN said that communications were maintained between the drone, the warship, and the Naval Air Command, although it’s unclear where the control station for the drone was located. As far as we know, the drone did not land on the Dokdo at any point in the trials. The Gray Eagle STOL at the rear of the flight deck of the Dokdo amphibious assault ship in the Sea of Japan. ROKN The Gray Eagle STOL prepares for launch. ROKN The Gray Eagle STOL used in the trials very clearly carries the U.S. civilian registration N450MV, indicating that it’s the same airframe as the original Mojave demonstrator, modified to the latest standard, or at the very least given a new coat of paint. As GA-ASI puts it, 'Gray Eagle STOL is General Atomics’ name for the production variant of the historic aircraft demonstrator known as Mojave' — but it remains unclear what, if any changes have been made to the actual aircraft in the meantime. The General Atomics Mojave. GA-ASI The Dokdo class appear to provide a suitable platform for exploring operations by fixed-wing drones — and could potentially field them on a permanent or regular basis in the future. The Dokdo class LPH is 652 feet long, 101 feet wide, and has a displacement of 19,500 tons. The Gray Eagle STOL gets aloft from the Dokdo amphibious assault ship in the Sea of Japan. Note the plane guard helicopter airborne to the rear. ROKN As it stands now, the Dokdos are configured to carry a complement of around 10 medium-lift helicopters, such as the ROKN’s UH-60P Black Hawks or Leonardo AW159 Wildcats. In the past, South Korea looked at using the Dokdo class design as a springboard to develop a true fixed-wing capable aircraft carrier that could embark F-35B short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) stealth fighters. More recently, those plans — for the so-called CVX — were dramatically scaled back, with Seoul instead choosing to invest in its increasingly capable submarine fleet.

YouTube screencap These changing priorities may well have helped generate interest in fixed-wing drone operations, instead. In the process, GA-ASI is gaining more experience in operating its Gray Eagle STOL and related Mojave from the decks of different warships. Almost exactly a year ago, TWZ reported on the experimental operations involving the Mojave aboard the U.K. Royal Navy’s HMS Prince of Wales, the first time the drone had operated from an aircraft carrier. For its part, the Royal Navy is increasingly looking to harness the capability offered by uncrewed aircraft for its carrier force. A Mojave drone during trials from the deck of HMS Prince of Wales. GA-ASI With a 901-foot-long flight deck, HMS Prince of Wales (and its sister vessel HMS Queen Elizabeth) offers more ‘real estate’ for Gray Eagle STOL operations than the Dokdo class, which has a flight deck length of just under 653 feet. Unlike the Gray Eagle STOL trials on the Dokdo, the Mojave demonstration on HMS Prince of Wales involved a takeoff and a landing. The dimensions of the Dokdo may well put some limits on Gray Eagle STOL’s load-carrying capability. While we don’t have the figures for Gray Eagle STOL, according to GA-ASI, the Mojave has a takeoff run of 1,000 feet when armed with 12 AGM-114 Hellfire air-to-surface missiles. However, when configured for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions, the Mojave’s takeoff distance is reduced to just 400 feet. Provided the figure is broadly the same for Gray Eagle STOL, this would be ample when operating off from the South Korean warship. The addition of an electromagnetic catapult on big deck amphibious assault ships, which is of rising interest with navies around the globe, could potentially allow an aircraft like Gray Eagle STOL to operate at higher gross weights from their decks. When the Mojave was first unveiled, GA-ASI pointed out that its improved short-field performance and rugged landing gear would also make it suitable for carrier-based operations. What’s more, these can be conducted without any need for a catapult to launch the drone or arresting gear during recovery. The same characteristics have now been ported over to the Gray Eagle STOL. At the same time, the Gray Eagle STOL adds new features that were not found on the Mojave, including the various technologies introduced on the improved Gray Eagle 25M. This drone was developed to provide the U.S. Army with the option to procure a more advanced version of the MQ-1C Gray Eagle, with various enhancements specifically designed to meet better the demands of a future conflict with a peer or near-peer state. The Gray Eagle STOL launches from the Dokdo amphibious assault ship in the Sea of Japan. ROKN The new features on the Gray Eagle 25M — now found on the Gray Eagle STOL — include an improved heavy-fuel engine, increased onboard power, significantly reduced maintenance requirements, and an expeditionary laptop-based ground control station. In our previous coverage of the Mojave, we discussed how the drone would be likely suitable for use not only from aircraft carriers like the Queen Elizabeth class but also from large assault ships, also without launch and recovery gear, like the Dokdo class — not to mention the U.S. Navy’s America class landing helicopter assault (LHA) and Wasp class landing helicopter dock (LHD) ships. The same applies to the Gray Eagle STOL. The Mojave demonstrator on the deck of the U.K. Royal Navy’s aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales. Crown Copyright Maritime missions for the Gray Eagle STOL or the Mojave could include overwatch of the amphibious assault task group, including the beachhead, or overwatch during force protection missions in ‘brown water’ or littoral environments. Carrying surveillance equipment, the drones could also expand the reach of the Dokdo class during anti-submarine warfare operations, making good use of the unarmed Mojave’s endurance of between 10 and 12 hours when launched off a carrier-sized landing area with no weapons. Since the Gray Eagle STOL and the Mojave can also be armed, these missions could be extended to persistent armed overwatch, or even strike, including close air support of an amphibious assault, for example. Moreover, having armed drones would bring an entirely new fixed-wing combat capability to the Dokdo class, which currently relies on helicopters to provide extended anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare capabilities. The full Mojave product card. GA-ASI When operating in ‘blue water’ environments, these types of drones could also prove very valuable as networking and communications relay nodes, as well as acting as electronic warfare platforms, and even for airborne early warning. Overall, a MALE drone offers a set of capabilities that a helicopter simply can’t replicate. With their short range, helicopters cannot maintain a presence for many hours at a time, at extended ranges from the ship, or at the kinds of elevated altitudes that these kinds of drones can. These attributes translate to far superior line-of-sight performance and endurance, which would further free the host warship from relying on land-based assets and provide them with much improved organic capabilities. South Korea’s Yonhap news agency described yesterday’s test as part of wider 'efforts to better integrate and improve operations of manned and unmanned military equipment' within the Republic of Korea Armed Forces. While the plans to fly the Gray Eagle STOL from the Dokdo class landing platform helicopter (LPH) — two of which are in ROKN service — had not previously been publicized, South Korea’s efforts to introduce drones of various classes and types have been significant. The Dokdo (LPH-6111) steams in the Sea of Japan followed by USS Lassen (DDG-82) and USS Chung-Hoon (DDG-93) during an exercise in the Sea of Japan in July 2010. U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class (SW/AW) Adam K. Thomas/RELEASED MC3 Adam K. Thomas The Republic of Korea Armed Forces already operates a wide range of drones, ranging in size from Israeli-made Harpy loitering munitions to U.S.-supplied RQ-4B Block 30 Global Hawk high-altitude, long-endurance, remotely piloted aircraft. Locally developed drone programs include the Korean Unmanned System – Fixed-wing Strategic (KUS-FS) medium-altitude, long-endurance drone, broadly similar to the U.S. MQ-9 Reaper, and the Korean Unmanned System – Vertical Helicopter (KUS-VH), an uncrewed armed scout adaptation of the MD500 helicopter, and therefore equivalent to the Unmanned Little Bird developed by Boeing. In the future, South Korea plans to field drones to complement the KF-21 Boramae next-generation combat aircraft, as a means of boosting the potential of the crewed fighter as well as maximizing ‘combat mass.’ You can read more about the concept here. Last year, South Korea showcased a new stealthy-shaped flying wing drone, apparently intended to test technologies that could feed into ‘loyal wingman’ efforts as well as drones for potentially a wide range of other tasks. A rendering of what manufacturer Korean Air is pitching as a 'Stealth UAV Squadron' that includes a flying wing-type UCAV and multiple loyal wingman-type drones. Korean Air So far, however, drone activities by the ROKN have been more limited. Acquisitions have included the popular Schiebel CAMCOPTER S-300 unmanned air system (UAS), a small rotary-wing drone that can operate from the flight decks of even small warships. The Gray Eagle STOL recovers to a land base in Pohang after its historic mission yesterday. ROKN At this stage, we have little idea of Seoul’s ambitions in terms of fixed-wing drone operations from the Dokdo class — or even future amphibious assault ships. Perhaps more importantly, at least in the short term, the trials aboard the Dokdo have further underscored the ability of both the Gray Eagle STOL and the Mojave to operate from ships of this size, something that is likely to be of interest to operators of other aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships, even without launch and recovery gear.

Russia’s Largest Film Studio Donated Antique Tanks To The Militar...	Russia has lost so many tanks in Ukraine that the nation’s largest studio has donated movie props to bolster its armor force. '&#8230;in 2023, we handed over 28 T-55 tanks, 8 PT-76 tanks, 6 infantry fighting vehicles and 8 trucks we had in our military department to the Armed Forces,' Mosfilm Director Gen. Karen Shakhnazarov told Vladimir Putin during a meeting at the Kremlin on Wednesday. 'I knew that they needed them, so I got in touch with the Defense Ministry, and they took these vehicles.' Mosfilm Director General Karen Shakhnazarov (left) met with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin Wednesday. (Kremlin) The tanks and armor were part of a collection of nearly 200 Mosfilm had on hand, the studio states on its website. 'All equipment is a prop (stage-site-site means), is in good condition and is ready to shoot several films at the same time,' Mosfilm explains, adding it 'provides its own sites for filming films with the participation of military equipment, on the territory of the military-technical base itself, as well as in the adjacent forest belt.' Among its armor collection, the studio had T-54/55s and PT-76s. Examples of tanks like those can be seen in the following images. Soviet T-55 tanks in front of Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin on October 28, 1961 HUM Images A Russian PT-76 light amphibious tank. (Alexander Kovalenko) So far, Russia has lost at least 3,549 tanks, according to the Dutch Oryx open-source tracking group. That figure includes 2,484 destroyed: 158 damaged, 374 abandoned, and 533 captured. The total figure is higher because Oryx only tabulates losses for which it has visual confirmation. The studio’s donation at best seems symbolic. The small handful donated to the military represents a little more than 1% of Russian tank losses fighting Ukraine. Moreover, they are very old. The first prototype of the T-54/55s appeared in 1945 while the PT-76 amphibious tanks have been in service since 1952. It is unclear exactly how Russia will use these tanks, but as we previously reported, T-54/55s began appearing on the battlefield last year. As we reported at the time, those tanks were seen - reportedly in southeastern Ukraine - about a month after trainloads of them were spotted on the move in Russia, prompting speculation that they would soon be taking part in the conflict. In March 2023, the Conflict Intelligence Team (СІТ) reported on Telegram that the tanks departed from the city of Arsenyev in the Primorsky Krai, which is home to the 1295th Central Base of Repairs and Storage of Tanks of the Russian Army. You can see those tanks in the video below. The T-54/55s have been used in combat, as we have noted in the past. When the tanks first appeared, we posited that they offered some added protection to their crews, especially against shrapnel from artillery shells and similar threats that are very pronounced on battlefields in Ukraine. Though unsuitable for direct tank-on-tank combat, their 100mm main guns could still be useful for engaging lighter enemy vehicles and fortified strong points, as well as just opposing troops caught in the open. A Russian T-54/55 tank on a train. (Via Twitter screencap) They have also been used as remote-controlled bombs, packed with explosives. It is also possible that Mosfilm's tanks could be used for spare parts or even as decoys. Russia has previously used inflatable tanks designed to confuse Ukrainian forces and get them to waste ammunition. After the Cold War ended, Russia, like the U.S., drew down conventional forces. That included a large number of the more than 80,000 T-54/55s produced. They were placed in storage, mainly in the Far East, since they had already been displaced by more modern tanks in the military districts closer to NATO’s own tank forces. Far fewer of the PT-76s were made, with about 12,000 produced. While able to maneuver well in the water with its wide hull and water jet propulsion, it had some serious deficiencies, like a large silhouette, weak armor protection, and an underpowered 76 mm gun. Russia has replaced them with newer amphibious armor vehicles. Still, the PT-76s were sent into service to fight Ukraine in June 2022, according to a well-known Ukrainian military observer. 'It remained in service with the Russian army until 2010, after which all remaining PT-76s were sent into storage with subsequent, in the future, disposal,' Alexander Kovalenko wrote on Facebook at the time. 'But in 2022, the tank received a second life, after the ‘second’ army in the world decided to start a small victorious war for a week.' However, unlike the T-54/55s, we have seen no videos of large movements of the amphibious light tank to the front or in combat. According to Oryx, none have yet been lost on the battlefield. CIT, however, stated a variant of that tank - the BTR-50 tracked armored personnel carrier - was also pulled from Russian storage in March 2023. They began to emerge on the battlefield that month, we noted at the time. 'We find it difficult to name the possible areas of application of these tanks, but in any case, along with the removal of the BTR-50 from storage and the installation of naval anti-aircraft guns on the MT-LB, this clearly indicates serious problems with providing the Russian Armed Forces with armored vehicles,' CIT suggested at the time. Mosfilm, which has made more than 2,500 full-length films, has won some prestigious awards over the years, including three Oscars. However, its highest praise in Russia may have come today. 'Mosfilm is our pride,' Putin glowed.

Boeing’s Plan For Modernized AH-64 Apaches Serving Into The 2060s	Boeing is busily planning for future upgrades to the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter. While the scope of what is tentatively known as the Modernized Apache has been scaled back somewhat compared to how it once looked, the company is considering the lessons of the war in Ukraine as it seeks to optimize the AH-64 so that it can continue to serve the U.S. Army into the 2060s. Long before that time it will be operating alongside the Army’s Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) tiltrotor, which will bring a whole new set of capabilities — and new challenges — for the Apache. The War Zone spoke exclusively to T.J. Jamison, Boeing’s business development director for the Apache and for the AH-6 Little Bird. Jamison, a retired U.S. Army aviator, commanded an aviation squadron in Iraq and an aviation brigade in Afghanistan, having 72 Apaches under his command at one point in the latter theater. Three U.S. Army AH-64 Apaches fly in a holding pattern at the Red Sands exercise in the CENTCOM area of responsibility, on September 23, 2024. U.S. Army photo by Spc. Dean John Kd De Dios Spc. Dean John Kd De Dios As the largest Apache operator, the U.S. Army’s program of record currently covers 791 of the attack helicopters, with 91 of the older AH-64D Longbow, or 'Delta' models in service right now. Some of the U.S. Army Deltas are still passing through Boeing’s remanufacturing program, from which they emerge as the improved AH-64E Apache Guardian or 'Echo' versions. The size of the U.S. Army’s Apache fleet is determined by the organizational structure, in which there’s an attack battalion and an air cavalry squadron in each combat aviation brigade for each division. This makes it one of the very few customers who, in Jamison’s words, 'can truly fight with the Apache as a maneuver element in an air-ground integration concept, out there on the battlefield.' While this was the Cold War style of combat that the Apache was designed for, in more recent decades the helicopter was employed by the U.S. Army almost exclusively in a counterinsurgency (COIN) concept of operations, in the Middle East and Afghanistan. Now, with the war in Ukraine, the pendulum is swinging back toward something closer to the Cold War model, reflected in growing interest in the Apache in Europe.

Photo by ROMEO GACAD / AFP ROMEO GACAD Returning to the U.S. Army, as Jamison explains, the reason those last 91 Deltas have not yet been upgraded to the definitive standard is that they were previously due to be replaced in air cavalry squadrons by the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA). This was one of the U.S. Army’s highest-profile aviation programs until its cancelation earlier this year. That decision, which we discussed in detail, has an effect on the Apache force but, more critically, makes the AH-64 an even more critical asset for the Army and refocuses efforts to keep it effective and relevant for another four decades or more. 'Now that FARA has gone, the Army’s got to make a decision on what to do with these 91 Deltas,' Jamison says. 'Do they send them back to us to get remanufactured into Echos? What they do with the 91 is their decision.' Apache genesis Before looking at what comes next — and after the AH-64E — it’s worth looking at the evolution of the Apache, and the different drivers that have influenced its continued development since it first flew back in 1975 and after the introduction of the initial AH-64A or Alpha model in 1984. An AH-64A Apache is prepared for a mission during Operation Desert Storm, on February 27, 1991. Photo By U.S. Army/Getty Images U.S. Army 'When this aircraft first came about as an Alpha-model aircraft back in the 1980s, it was specifically designed for large-scale combat operations,' Jamison explains. Under the AirLand Battle doctrine devised in that decade, the AH-64A was intended to fight on the plains of Europe against a high-intensity, near-peer adversary — the massed armored formations of the Warsaw Pact. 'I think a lot of people have kind of forgotten that, because of the incredible success that we observed with this aircraft in the counterinsurgency environment in Iraq and Afghanistan,' Jamison continues. 'But now, as we have transitioned out of that type of warfare and are now focused on large-scale combat operations in the European theater and obviously in the Pacific area of responsibility, people have forgotten that this is what this aircraft was originally designed to do.' It’s very notable that, with the exception of the Apache, each one of the so-called Big Five programs that were central to U.S. Army modernization during the late 1970s and 1980s — the M1 Abrams main battle tank, the UH-60 Black Hawk utility and transport helicopter, the M2 and M3 Bradley fighting vehicles, and the Patriot air defense missile system — have all had a significant impact in the war in Ukraine, entering a European war decades after they were devised, but no less relevant with the passage of time. U.S. Army and Kuwaiti forces move to engage targets during a joint combined arms live-fire exercise near Camp Buehring, Kuwait, December 6-7, 2016. The multi-day exercise involved M1 Abrams tanks, AH-64 Apaches, Bradley fighting vehicles, and more. U.S. Army photo by Sgt. Aaron Ellerman Sgt. Aaron Ellerman After the fielding of the AH-64D in 1997, the crew experience changed radically with the introduction of an all-glass cockpit, but it was the Longbow fire-control radar that made the biggest difference in terms of capability. Now, rapid engagements of multiple targets at once were possible by only exposing the Delta’s mast-mounted radar dish above the tree line or another kind of cover, before popping up to fire a missile. The Delta also brought other significant advances, including the first iteration of manned-unmanned teaming and the Arrowhead, or Modernized Target Acquisition and Designation Sight (M-TADS). Less obvious was the addition of a Link 16 datalink, which was, Jamison admits, 'quite frankly, a little cumbersome.' Adding all this equipment bestowed new capabilities but also meant the airframe was gaining weight. 'In the Delta model, we started to lose that sports-car-like performance that we had with the Alpha, so that drove us to the Echo model, where the big changes are a new drivetrain, a new transmission to allow us to unlock additional horsepower through the T700-701D engines.' The GE Aerospace T700-701D engine. GE Aerospace The AH-64E therefore returned more sprightly performance and because of that boost, more capabilities could be accommodated. The Echo features fully integrated Link 16, for a 'much more seamless, easier-to-use capability' and significant improvements were also made to manned-unmanned teaming. Improvements to the radar saw its range extended from five miles all the way up to 10 miles. The improved radar in the Echo not only allows targets to be engaged at greater distances, but a new advanced air-to-air mode sets the Apache up for kinetic engagements in the counter-unmanned aircraft system (UAS) mission, something that is of increasing importance for the U.S. Army and others, and which Jamison expects will be further expanded upon in future upgrades. 'The other thing we added in [the Echo model] was a maritime mode, where the radar will identify classes of vessels at sea, regardless of sea states,' Jamison explains. Previously, higher waves were a major challenge for the Apache’s radar, and identifying maritime targets is of obvious relevance in the Pacific theater.

U.S. Marine Corps photo by Cpl. Elize McKelvey/Released Cpl. Elize McKelvey Version 6.5 The Echo versions started out with Version 1 and by now Version 4.5 is a common standard among different operators. Meanwhile, Version 6 is coming off the production line today, and Boeing is under contract for V6.5, a configuration that first flew in October of 2023. 'We’re continuing to do testing and flight developments on V6.5. For the customer, it’s going to bring a common configuration of software across the entire fleet,' Jamison says. 'Right now, if you go from one aviation brigade in the U.S. Army, let’s say at Fort Campbell, and then you go to Fort Novosel, or Joint Base Lewis–McChord, there’s a good chance that you’re going to have a different version of the Echo models, and you’ll have to do some transition training.' A stock photo of an AH-64E, here with the V6 configuration. U.S. Army photo V6.5 will simplify the U.S. Army’s Apache fleet and give them some new capabilities, mostly at the software level. Jamison highlights one of the biggest advantages of the new software and one that should play a big part in the Apache’s future development path, namely setting the helicopter up for the future integration of the General Electric T901 turboshaft engine developed under the Improved Turbine Engine Program (ITEP). 'We’ve incorporated future growth into the V6.5 to integrate capabilities that, heck, we may not even know about right now, that are still out there in the development stage,' Jamison says. 'By having an open systems architecture, just like with your iPhone, we can get software updates fully integrated. When you have to integrate something like Link 16 or whatever that next capability will be, you don’t have to send it back to the factory. We don’t have to go in there and do significant software upgrades.' Jamison described a recent Boeing demonstration, where a third party brought in a radio that had never been put into an Apache and installed it, while the Boeing engineers stood back and watched their ‘plug and play’ integration of that radio. 'That may sound simple, but it really is not. It’s really a lot more technical than you would think, but they were able to do that without any Boeing assistance,' Jamison recalls. 'So that’s where we’re headed because that sets us up for future growth into the next-generation Apache.' As to what that next-generation Apache looks like, that’s still somewhat unclear, but Boeing expects the U.S. Army will want to keep flying the attack helicopter into the 2060s timeframe. That will involve a lot of potential changes to the helicopter, which is why the open architecture is now being prioritized, allowing simpler and more cost-effective integration of future capabilities. Boeing Advanced flight controls Another area of future development is advanced flight controls, in the form of the Active Parallel Actuation System (APAS). Jamison explains: 'This is a system where we’re doing everything we can to reduce the pilot workload in the cockpit as these new capabilities come on board, particularly with counter-UAS lessons learned from Ukraine, bringing in more Link 16, Launched Effects, and other things that we don’t even know about yet,' Jamison says. 'Five, 10, or 15 years down the road, we know we have the potential to overwhelm the crew, so we’re doing things to reduce pilot workload, and one of those is the advanced flight controls.' As far as the pilot is concerned, the advanced flight controls add soft stops to the controls, as Jamison explains. 'Imagine, as you’re pulling in power, and you’re about to reach a power limit, a torque limit if you had a soft stop built into those controls where you felt it, a physical and tactile feel where you had to pull through that, versus getting your head in the cockpit looking at a gauge instead of looking outside where the threat is. That’s the whole concept behind the advanced flight controls.' Launched Effects Launched Effects are a growing area of interest for the U.S. Army, especially. At one point, the service described a future family of Air-Launched Effects (ALE), small uncrewed aerial systems that could be adapted for a range of missions, not only limited to standoff attack, but also including surveillance, electronic warfare, communications relay, and serving as decoys. The Army now refers to these simply as Launched Effects, reflecting the fact that some are likely to be deployed from dismounted launchers on the ground or from vehicles, as well as from aircraft. Boeing concept artwork showing Modernized Apaches deploying Launched Effects in the form of small drones. Boeing Boeing New helmet display Among the pilot aids that Boeing is now working on is a follow-on to the current Integrated Helmet And Display Sight System (IHADSS), which is basically the monocle imaging system that goes over one eye. For its time, IHADSS was state of the art, but with the right eye looking at imaging that’s presented on the monocle and the left eye looking inside the cockpit or outside, it was something that some pilots struggled with in the past, Jamison says. This is a well-known and challenging aspect of fighting in the Apache that was even made into a plot point in the Apache-centric Nick Cage action movie Firebirds. Rapid developments in augmented reality and helmet-mounted sights over the past two decades, including the ability to display more information to the pilot, are likely to be key to achieving these improvements.

Devin Klecan 'It worked really well, for the technology that we had at the time, but now there are new technologies that will allow us to put all of that data on a visor-type environment, kind of like what an F-35 does right now, and so we don’t have just that single piece of an IHADSS. This will make it a much more lethal, seamless capability going forward.' Other changes in the cockpit are being heralded by the advanced crew station, which includes a large touch screen, instead of the previous multiple multifunctional displays. Boeing is also looking at refining the seating arrangement with the aim of making it more comfortable for missions that might last as long as 10 hours. Propulsion systems The more powerful ITEP engine is very much seen as underpinning the future of the Apache. 'The ability to bring ITEP into the Apache and get a full 3,850 horsepower into that aircraft, that sets you up for room for growth, extended range, reach, and payloads.' The first GE Aerospace T901 flight test engine, which was designated for Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) competitive prototypes. GE Aerospace Program Executive Office, Aviati Boeing received a developmental contract for the integration of ITEP into the Apache, but the U.S. Army has, for now, made the decision to prioritize putting the new engine into the Black Hawk. 'There has not been a decision to not put ITEP into the Apache, so we are still working to our customer’s desires and we’re using some of our own funds to continue the design work to get ITEP into the Apache,' Jamison says. 'We really firmly believe that you’re going to need that 3,850 horsepower to incorporate some of these additional capabilities.' Ahead of ITEP, Boeing is working on other improvements to the Apache’s propulsion system, with the Improved Tail Rotor Blade (ITRB) and Improved Tail Rotor Drive System (ITRDS). Boeing is currently under a developmental contract for ITRB, which is primarily focused on sustainment, ensuring the tail rotor blades can be more easily repaired and maintained, including on the battlefield. Meanwhile, ITRDS ensures that more power and authority are delivered to the tail rotor and is seen as something that will pave the way toward ITEP. What will the next Apache look like? Boeing is increasingly focused on what comes after the AH-64E Version 6.5, whatever that might be called. Jamison uses the name Modernized Apache but also references the New-Generation Apache. Importantly, while the next AH-64 might be a new iteration of the Echo, it could be something more radically different. Earlier Boeing concept artwork showing a possible future Apache, including increased-area stub wings. Boeing While its name and final appearance are yet to be determined, this future Apache 'is still a very, very active pursuit of ours,' Jamison confirms. Boeing is working with the U.S. Army and the Futures Command on some of the aforementioned lines of effort that will lead to a Modernized Apache, with some of those efforts, or portions of them, under contract with the Army and some being funded using the company’s dollars. Boeing sees a need for a Modernized Apache capability in the 2032 to 2035 timeframe and, to achieve that is looking at the option of a remanufacturing program, like that which turns older AH-64Ds into new AH-64E versions. As Jamison explains, 'Our concept, as we go from Echo to Modernized Apache, will be along much the same lines. We believe they will need a new fuselage because fuselages have a lifespan because of the rigors that they go through. We know they will need more power for that growth aspect. So we’re really focused on those lines of effort for that next-generation Apache, whatever it’s going to be called.' An artist’s concept of a Modernized Apache in an Indo-Pacific scenario. Boeing The result should give the U.S. Army not only a zero-time, new-fuselage helicopter but also one that has greater 'real estate' onto which new capabilities can be attached. In many ways, the current vision involves a less dramatic makeover than the kind Boeing had suggested in the past. For example, the articulated tail rotor, which could articulate 90 degrees to provide forward thrust during level flight, 'is not in our plans right now,' according to Jamison. A chart from a 2014 Boeing presentation showing an artist’s conception of the then-proposed compound Apache design, including an articulated tail rotor. Boeing While an articulated tail rotor promised a major boost in performance, Boeing now thinks that cleaning up the fuselage from an aerodynamic perspective and increasing the power through ITEP, will provide the required speeds, although Jamison admits the end result likely won’t be as fast as with an articulated tail rotor. The combination of aerodynamic refinements and uprated engines also promises to increase range and payload. Retractable landing gear is another performance-enhancing option that Boeing eyed in the past, but which has been dropped for the time being, the company considering it not worth the effort considering the weight and complexity that it brings. Jamison did say that Boeing is looking at moving the radar from its mast-mounted position, as a potential aerodynamic improvement, something that doesn’t appear to have been shown in concept artwork so far. The mast-mounted AN/APG-78 Longbow fire-control radar. Northrop Grumman 'We’ve got that large piece of flat-plate drag sitting up above the rotor system. At the time we put it up there for a very specific reason, so you could just stick that thing above an obstacle and hide the rest of the aircraft. With some of the new technologies that we have, particularly with Launched Effects and with fully integrated Link 16, it’s allowing us to fight and engage from much greater ranges. Having it above the rotor system is not quite as critical.' Instead, Boeing wants to integrate the radar into the fuselage, cleaning up a lot of the aerodynamics of the Apache, especially when combined with other aerodynamic modifications. One way of installing a radar internally could be to use a conformal AESA arrays, a technology that is getting ever smaller and more versatile. As Jamison points out, Launched Effects and Link 16 — relying more on third-party sensor platforms and their networked data overall — also reduces the need for any radar in many circumstances, providing another route to gaining targeting data and then prosecuting targets, including at standoff ranges. Lessons from Ukraine As to how the war in Ukraine is affecting thinking about the future Apache, Jamison noted the value in understanding how things have evolved in that conflict, but urged caution on jumping to blanket conclusions.

'And I’m not saying we discount those lessons. We must watch those and pay attention to them, but we’ve got to put them in the proper context. And what I mean by that is you’re looking at two militaries that are not at the same level of sophistication and modernization as NATO’s forces — particularly the Ukrainian side.' Of the lessons that are coming out of Ukraine, Boeing is 'really, really focused on how to counter some of the threats that we’re seeing right now, particularly the counter-UAS capability.' With that in mind, Jamison sees both kinetic and non-kinetic (electronic warfare) counter-UAS solutions as integral to the Apache’s future development path. While these capabilities might not yet be mature, work on bringing open architecture systems to the V6.5 aircraft will ensure that they can accommodate them in the future. . @USArmy Soldiers engage an unmanned aerial system (UAS) from an AH-64 with upgraded Hellfire missile during Red Sands training exercise in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. @usarmycentral pic.twitter.com/HG9ChuWxt6&mdash; U.S. Central Command (@CENTCOM) September 30, 2024 'Think about it, five years ago, was anybody talking about lethal, low-cost drones that are literally flying down Ukrainian or Russian trenches, and chasing individual soldiers? Nobody was thinking about that, so that’s why the open system architecture is so critically important. People will say they know what’s coming next, but have we ever predicted the way a future conflict was actually going to play out? I think everybody’s track record is pretty poor in that regard.' Apache meets FLRAA Change of a different kind is also coming to the U.S. Army with the FLRAA tiltrotor, which promises to herald a revolution in air assault operations, with a whole new set of speed, range, and survivability metrics. With that in mind, and with FARA canceled, questions might be asked about how the Apache — or future versions of it — might keep pace with FLRAA’s capabilities and the obvious difference in speed. An artist’s concept of the Army’s Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) tiltrotor. Bell When asked about this, Jamison suggested that viewing the Apache as a simple escort to FLRAA — in the mode of a P-51 fighter to a B-17 bomber — is 'a very old-school way of thinking that doesn’t really apply to the modern battlefield.' Instead, the Apache will fight according to its point of impact on the battlefield, the place where it will make a difference, whether that’s in direct support of a brigade combat team on the ground, being utilized as a battalion maneuver element, or conducting deep strike operations into enemy territory. Aided by Link 16, Launched Effects, and other capabilities, the Apache will exploit its ability to reach deep into the battlefield in support of FLRAA, rather than being a physical presence right next to the fast-flying tiltrotor. AH-64D Apaches assigned to the 1st Battalion, 3rd Aviation Regiment, 12th Combat Aviation Brigade land at the Katterbach Army Airfield, Germany, on May 20, 2022, after spending roughly three months in the Baltic region while participating in Exercise Saber Strike 22. U.S. Army photo by Staff Sgt. Thomas Mort Jamison outlines one scenario in which Apaches are already in the fight, on station, and creating the conditions on the battlefield that will allow FLRAA to quickly ingress or egress. In this way, the attack helicopters ensure that additional capabilities — whether artillery or an anti-tank squad team — can join the fight, by reducing the level of threat against FLRAA as it ingresses in, and egresses out. There remain, however, legitimate questions about how the Apache should be able to reach the areas where it can have an impact, bearing in mind the extended distances at which FLRAA should operate and, once there, whether it would be able to survive in the face of the kinds of advanced air defense systems that a peer adversary can bring to bear. These concerns are only magnified in the Pacific theater, in a potential future conflict with China, where the 'tyranny of distance' is compounded by high-end anti-aircraft threats. With the Apache's combat radius defined as a couple hundred miles or so depending on the loadout and mission profile, its relevance in such a conflict is in question. Using forward arming and refueling points can help with getting the Apaches where they need to fight and back again, but those too can be vulnerable to rapid enemy attack. A U.S. Army AH-64 during shipborne maneuvers in the Pacific. U.S. Army www.twz.com While there are a variety of different takeaways from the conflict, the war in Ukraine has certainly raised questions over the future role of the attack helicopter and, amid budgetary constraints, it’s conceivable that the AH-64 fleet — which already consumes a huge portion of the Army budget for rotary aviation — might be vulnerable, if the conclusion is that its previous relevance has been eroded. Nevertheless, with FARA out of the picture and the U.S. Army aiming to operate Apaches of one kind or another for decades to come, Boeing is understandably confident about the future of the attack helicopter — and that’s before even taking into account international customers. Further sales to Israel and South Korea look increasingly likely and even Canada is assessing a future attack helicopter purchase. Meanwhile, Boeing continues to refine its now-classic design in a variety of ways. While the latest vision of the Modernized Apache is somewhat less ambitious than previous concepts suggested, it will be fascinating to see what route its development takes next.

F-35C Naval Joint Strike Fighters Fly Combat Missions Against Hou...	U.S. Marine Corps F-35C Joint Strike Fighters flying from the deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln took part in recent operations against Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen, the Pentagon has disclosed. This appears to be one of the first combat outings, if not the first, for carrier-based C variants of the F-35 belonging to either the Marines or the U.S. Navy. 'U.S. Central Command [CENTCOM] forces executed a series of precise airstrikes [on] November 9 through 10 on multiple Houthi weapons storage facilities situated within Houthi-controlled territories in Yemen,' Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder said at a routine press briefing today. 'These facilities housed a variety of advanced conventional weapons used by the Iran-backed Houthis to target US and international military and civilian vessels navigating international waters in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.' 'The operation involved U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy assets, to include F-35C fighter aircraft,' Ryder added. A US Marine Corps F-35C launches from the USS Abraham Lincoln in August 2024. USN 'DOD: U.S. Navy F-35Cs make combat debut along with USAF aircraft in series of targeted operations Nov. 9-10 on Houthi targets in Yemen,' Brian Everstine, Aviation Week's Pentagon editor subsequently wrote in a post on X. Maj. Gen. Ryder appears to have misspoken about the F-35Cs in question belonging to the Navy, as did Everstine (who later corrected himself). A video CENTCOM released today, seen below, shows F-35Cs, as well as an F/A-18F Super Hornet fighter and an EA-18G Growler electronic warfare aircraft, taking off from the supercarrier USS Abraham Lincoln as part of the November 9-10 strikes against the Houthis. The only F-35C unit aboard Lincoln currently is Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 314 (VMFA-314), the 'Black Knights.'

Gen. Ryder did not explicitly say that this was the first time F-35Cs had been employed in combat. It is possible that this is just the first time Marine C models have flown combat sorties. VMFA-314 may have flown combat missions in the region before now, as well. Lincoln first arrived in the CENTCOM area of responsibility back in August. What munitions the F-35Cs employed during their sorites against the Houthis over the weekend is also unknown, but the jets in the CENTCOM video do not appear to be carrying any weapons externally. F-35Cs can currently carry 1,000 and 2,000-pound class Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) GPS-assisted precision-guided bombs, 500-pound class Paveway-series laser-guided bombs, and AGM-154 Joint Stand-Off Weapon (JSOW) precision glide-bombs, as well as AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM), internally The War Zone has reached out to the Pentagon, CENTCOM, the Navy, and the Marines for more information. VMFA-314 F-35Cs on the deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln in May 2024. USN Regardless, F-35Cs are now clearly being employed in combat. This follows the combat debut of U.S. F-35Bs (also flown by the Marines) in 2018 against targets in Afghanistan and of U.S. Air Force F-35As in strikes on targets in Iraq the next year. In 2018, Israeli F-35I Adirs had also become the first Joint Strike Fighters operated by any country to see combat. British F-35Bs are the only other Joint Strikes Fighters known to have flown combat missions. The F-35C, which the U.S. military is currently the only operator of, was also the last Joint Strike Fighter variant to reach the initial operational capability milestone (in 2019) and only began deploying on Navy carriers in 2021. VMFA-314 was actually the first Marine F-35C squadron to deploy on a carrier, wrapping up its initial deployment aboard the Abraham Lincoln the following year. A VMFA-314 F-35C prepares to launch from the USS Abraham Lincoln in 2021. USN U.S. military operations in and around the Red Sea against the Houthis have already produced a number of naval aviation firsts and, unfortunately, the crisis shows no signs of abating. Following the strikes by the F-35Cs and other aircraft over the weekend, the Houthis launched a barrage of anti-ship ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as kamikaze drones, against two Arleigh Burke class destroyers assigned to the USS Abraham Lincoln's strike group. 'On November 11, U.S. Central Command forces successfully repelled multiple Iranian-backed Houthi attacks during the transit of the Bab al-Mandab Strait. During the transit, the Arleigh Burke class guided missile destroyer[s] USS Stockdale and USS Spruance were attacked by at least eight one-way attack uncrewed aerial systems, five anti-ship ballistic missiles, and three anti-ship cruise missiles, which were successfully engaged and defeated,' Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder said at his briefing today. 'The vessels were not damaged. No personnel were hurt. &#8230; To the best of my knowledge, I'm not aware of any attacks against the Abraham Lincoln.' VMFA-314's F-35Cs, as well as the rest of the Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group, look set to continue being engaged against the Houthis.

Ukraine Will Have Received 600 French Hammer Bombs By End Of Year	France will have delivered a total of 600 AASM-250 Hammer rocket-assisted bombs to Ukraine by the end of the year, according to the French National Assembly Defense Committee. The Hammers will have come from existing, aging stocks, and plans are in the works to quickly produce more. 'The production of AASM bombs must be significantly accelerated in order to renew the [French] stocks with new munitions,' the committee stated. 'The Ministry of the Armed Forces now aims to produce 1,200 by 2025.' In January, we wrote that France would send Ukraine 50 Hammers per month. The baseline 500-pound-class version has a stand-off range of up to around 43 miles (70 kilometers), similar to that of Ukraine’s U.S.-supplied winged Joint Direct Attack Munition-Extended Range bombs, or JDAM-ERs The Hammer bombs have been used by Ukraine to great effect. In August, we had our best look yet one of the country’s MiG-29 Fulcrum fighters employing these precision-guided munitions. A video released at the time, shot from inside the jet’s cockpit, showed the pilot utilizing a low-level toss bomb technique, which is one mode in which the rocket-boosted munitions were designed to be used. Ukrainian Air Force spokesman Col. Yuri Ignat posted the footage, seen below, which shows the release of two Hammers, on social media earlier today. Ignat said he did so earlier than planned as a tribute to Oleksandr Myhulia, the Ukrainian pilot who shot the video and who was killed while flying a combat mission on August 12. Ukraine is also using Su-25 Frogfoot ground-attack aircraft as Hammer bomb trucks.

Faced with pressure, largely over a weak economy, Chancellor Olaf Scholz called for a snap election on Feb. 23. A leading challenger for that job issued an ultimatum to Russian President Vladimir Putin that his forces should end the fight in 24 hours or he would push to provide air-launched Taurus KEPD 350 cruise missiles to Ukraine. That's a 180-degree change from Scholz's position. 'Scholz absolutely refuses to deliver the Taurus missiles, even though a majority in the Bundestag sees it differently,' said Friedrich Merz, leader of the Christian Democratic Union. 'I am open to it and have suggested giving the government in Kyiv the right to say: If the bombing of civilians does not stop within 24 hours, the range restrictions on the available weapons will be jointly lifted. If that’s not enough, the Taurus missiles will be delivered a week later. This would allow Ukraine to regain the initiative.' The Taurus missile, which offers broadly similar capabilities to the British Storm Shadow and French SCALP-EG, reportedly has a range of more than 300 miles. Ukraine has been seeking it as another weapon to strike deep behind Russian lines. Germany recently announced plans to acquire a new variant of that missile, which you can read more about here. Giving Ukraine Taurus missiles and lifting restrictions on the use of weapons deep inside Russia would provide Kyiv with a much-needed boost in its long-range strike capacity. Germany's snap election comes a day ahead of the third anniversary of the full-on invasion of Ukraine. A Merz victory might be a hopeful sign for Kyiv. If I become chancellor of Germany, I will give Putin an ultimatum regarding Ukraine, — Friedrich Merz If this is not done within 24 hours, he is ready to supply Ukraine with Taurus missiles and give permission to strike the territory of Russia. pic.twitter.com/6jXx0fle22&mdash; MAKS 24 (@Maks_NAFO_FELLA) November 11, 2024 The Latest On the battlefield, Russia's massive Kursk counteroffensive is so far making little headway, the Pentagon’s top spokesman told The War Zone on Tuesday. The Russians have been making 'incremental gains' in Kursk 'with the Ukrainians largely holding a line,' said Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder during a press briefing in response to our question. In Ukraine, meanwhile, the Russians continue to gain territory, especially in the east near Kurakhove in Donetsk Oblast. There are also rumblings by Russian milbloggers of a potentially large-scale attack in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. 'In recent days, more and more data has been coming in about the activation of Russian troops in different sections of the key front - Zaporizhzhya,' the Russian Operation Z Telegram channel claimed. 'This is approximately 125 kilometers wide from the Kakhovka Reservoir in the west to the Vremyevsk salient (Velyka Novosyolka area) in the east. The Russian army is attacking in several directions at once.' Here are some key takeaways from the Institute for the Study of War's (ISW) latest assessment: Ukrainian forces recently advanced in Kursk Oblast. Russian forces are successfully leveraging their recent seizure of Vuhledar to make tactically significant gains south of Kurakhove in support of ongoing Russian offensive operations that aim to level the frontline and eliminate the Ukrainian salient in western Donetsk Oblast. ISW is revising its previous assessment that Russian forces would not likely be able to take advantage of the seizure of Vuhledar for further offensive operations in western Donetsk Oblast. That assessment was incorrect. Russian forces reportedly continue to advance in the Donetsk-Zaporizhia Oblast border area, and Russian advances northwest of Vuhledar and south of Velyka Novosilka may begin to pressure Ukrainian positions in Velyka Novosilka. Russian forces have advanced in western Donetsk Oblast at a moderate tempo, but Russian forces remain highly unlikely to be able to conduct rapid mechanized maneuver that could successfully encircle Ukrainian forces. Ukrainian and Russian sources stated on November 11 that damage to a dam of the Kurakhivske Reservoir is causing limited flooding in nearby settlements. Ukrainian and Russian sources disagreed about who was responsible for damaging the dam, but Russian forces reportedly struck the dam in September 2024. Russian forces may have struck the dam in order to cause significant, long-lasting flooding west of Kurakhivske Reservoir that could facilitate Russian efforts to envelop Ukrainian forces north and south of Kurakhove.

While we have seen this before, we have not seen the associated hardware. An astute observer named Matt Fowler stated on Twitter that one of the images of the drone shows it contained a CORAL AI dev board capable of 'performing 4 trillion operations (tera-operations) per second (TOPS),' the company claims. Having artificial intelligence acquire a target and then guide an FPV drone in its terminal phase would provide a tremendous advantage in launching and completing attacks, something we first examined back in March when this technology appeared to be used by Ukraine.

They reportedly use AI terminal guidance, which would autonomously guide the nets onto FPV drones locked onto by the controller, greatly improving its ability to complete the attack. A video released by Russians shows the net-launching drone hunting down the FPV drone and firing a net that smothers it, causing it to crash to the ground. The U.S. Army is also looking into the use of net-firing drones and recently observed a demonstration of one such system at the Falcon Peak 2025 drone experiment at Fort Carson, Colorado.

That is designed to cause the operator to see mostly blank screens as the camera tries to adjust to the massive changes in exposure from the flashing light.

China’s New W5000 Cargo Drone Is The Biggest Yet	China’s development of uncrewed cargo aircraft continues apace, with the ongoing Airshow China including the first public appearance of the W5000, the biggest that we’ve seen so far, as well as a full-size mockup of one that can also operate from water, as well as a new concept for an air-launched cargo drone. China now has a multitude of cargo drones in development or under flight test, and beyond their clear civilian applications, their potential utility for helping maintain military logistics networks is very clear. The various cargo drones were displayed at Airshow China, also known as the China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition, in Zhuhai. The event officially opened today and runs until November 17. The big W5000 is from the Air White Whale company. This uncrewed cargo aircraft was unveiled last month when the first example rolled off the production line in the eastern Chinese city of Changzhou. A real example of the drone is part of the static display at Airshow China. The W5000, billed as the world's largest unmanned cargo plane, is shown at the 15th China International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition in Zhuhai, China, on November 12, 2024.

Photo by Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images CFOTO The W5000 is named for its payload of 5,000 kilograms — 11,023 pounds — and is said to have a maximum range of 2,600 kilometers (1,616 miles), with a cruising speed of up to 526 km/h (284 knots). The maximum takeoff weight of the drone is 10,800 kilograms (23,810 pounds). In comparison, the Xi’an Y-7 — a Chinese-produced version of the Soviet-era An-26 twin turboprop — still the main mid-size tactical transport used in China, has a payload of 5,500 kilograms (12,125 pounds). Reportedly, the high-wing, twin-engine W5000 is powered by AEP-100 turboprops produced by the Aero Engine Corporation of China. The rear loading ramp of the W5000.

Photo by Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images CFOTO According to Air White Whale, the W5000 is compatible with standard cargo pallets, which can be loaded and unloaded via a rear ramp and clamshell-type doors in the rear fuselage. The drone is designed to be able to use smaller general aviation airports as well as commercial aviation airports. The ground control system for the W5000 is said to allow a single operator to monitor up to five of the drones simultaneously. When announced, Air White Whale said it had submitted certification documents for the W5000 to Chinese regulators and expected to deliver the first aircraft in the second half of 2026.

However, the W5000 would appear to have obvious military applications, too. TWZ has already looked in detail at a similar Chinese uncrewed cargo aircraft, from the Tengen company, another high-wing, twin-engine design, but with a payload capacity of around 2,000 kilograms (4,410 pounds). The Tengen cargo drone with a payload of 2,000 kilograms that was first flown earlier this year. CCTV via China Daily Making its public debut at Airshow China, after having been announced last week, the CH-YH1000 uncrewed cargo aircraft has been developed by the state-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC). This design was shown in mockup form and in a promotional video. China CH-YH1000 Transport UAV is a Medium-altitude Multi-purpose Platform for Civil & Military Purposes.

The CH-YH1000 can accommodate different types of standard cargo pallets, which can be loaded and unloaded via the visor-type upward-opening nose door and via a rear ramp. Interestingly, the CH-YH1000 is already being pitched directly to the military, as well as commercial and other government operators. CASC’s promotional video shows versions of the drone being used for airdropping cargo loads, as well as dropping precision-guided munitions against a land target from a weapons bay in the lower fuselage. Most intriguingly, as well as having the option of tricycle landing gear to take off and land from traditional runaways, the CH-YH1000 can also be adapted for operations from water, taking off and landing using a pair of pontoon-type floats that are attached to either side of the lower fuselage. As well as cargo operations from water, this option also means the CH-YH1000 is being pitched for specific maritime operations including search and rescue, reconnaissance, and anti-submarine warfare. Still, operating a drone like this from a variable operating surface like water would pose some real challenges. As noted earlier, these are also not the first Chinese uncrewed cargo aircraft to have emerged in recent years. The state-run Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) has developed the HH-100 cargo drone, with a stated payload capacity of around 700 kilograms (some 1,543 pounds). The Tengen company, too, has flown another cargo drone, the TB-001D Scorpion D, which began to be tested in 2022, as you can read about here. This is a four-turboprop design with a stated payload capacity of 1,500 kilograms (3,307 pounds). The Tengen TB-001D Scorpion D on display during Airshow China 2024 on November 12, 2024. Photo by Jiang Jurong/VCG via Getty Images VCG Other Chinese firms have been working on larger cargo-carrying drone designs, as well. All this activity is perhaps not surprising considering the lead taken by Chinese companies in conducting uncrewed commercial cargo flights, including using Feihong-98 (FH-98) drones, a biplane design based on the Yun-5B, itself a Chinese copy of the famous Soviet-era Antonov An-2. Although China is busy building traditional cargo aircraft, spearheaded by the increasingly capable Y-20 family, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has a clear requirement for moving supplies in and out of a growing number of remote and austere locations, often with limited runway capacity. Chief among these are the highly strategic island outposts cropping up across the South China Sea. A Chinese Y-20 transport. via Chinese Internet www.twz.com It’s easy to imagine how uncrewed platforms could be ideal for routine resupply operations into such locations, not all of which might even be able to accept crewed cargo aircraft, or which might not be able to do so safely or efficiently. Outside of the South China Sea, there are plenty of other applications for PLA cargo drones, including some of the remote facilities on land in Western China, where the Chinese military presence is expanding and existing infrastructure is very often spartan. At the same time, the high altitudes involved in this region can be a challenge for some traditional transport aircraft. As we have discussed before, the PLA has a clear interest in further developing its capability to conduct expeditionary operations further and further from the Chinese mainland. Bearing in mind the kinds of challenges that any armed forces would face in an active conflict or other high-risk scenario in the Pacific theater, the option of having a fleet of cargo drones to help maintain logistics here would surely be attractive to the PLA. In particular, drones would be preferable for flying supplies into particularly hazardous locales, without having to expose the crew of a cargo plane to additional risk. Similar thinking is also evident in the U.S. military now, in particular the U.S. Marine Corps, which is also increasingly looking to introduce multiple tiers of cargo-carrying uncrewed aerial systems to help support future expeditionary and distributed operations. Once again, the demands of the Pacific theater are very much a driver here. So far, however, the kinds of cargo drones being eyed by the U.S. military are smaller and shorter-ranged than many of the designs now coming out of China. A rendering of the UH-72 Unmanned Logistics Connector — a cargo drone helicopter being offered to the U.S. Marine Corps. Airbus Overall, the U.S. military seems to be facing a growing airlift problem, especially in view of a potential confrontation with China in the Pacific. While there has been talk of uncrewed transport platforms, most concepts so far have focused on optionally crewed solutions. This is less satisfactory bearing in mind the much greater scale of the logistical challenge facing the United States compared with China when fighting in the Indo-Pacific region. Meanwhile, existing U.S. airlifters and tankers are increasingly being eyed for new roles on top of their basic transport tasks. Speaking last month, Brig. Gen. Shane Upton, the director of the U.S. Army’s Contested Logistics Cross-Functional Team, reflected upon the scale of the challenge for the U.S. military. He told Breaking Defense: 'We’re going to have to figure out how to resupply dispersed formations.' 'The Pacific, by nature, drives you to that. There’s no other option if you start putting a Multi-Domain Task Force lethal firing asset on a remote island chain, I have to resupply them with ammo and we may not be able to fly a traditional C-17 or C-130 in there,' Upton added. 'The enemy will be like: ‘You’re not using that port because I just shot it up and it’s gone.’' Finally, another type of cargo drone being shown at Zhuhai is CASC’s CH-103 (or Caihong-103, meaning Rainbow-103), described as a precision airdrop system and similar in concept to uncrewed cargo gliders that have been developed in the United States.

The range of the cargo glider was not stated and it’s unclear which transport aircraft it’s intended to be deployed from. The guidance system is also unclear, but some kind of inertial navigation system seems most likely at this point. This year’s Airshow China has already brought its fair share of surprises, but the prominent place taken by uncrewed cargo aircraft designs—including newly developed ones—demonstrates just how much importance is being assigned to this sector. For the most part, this growing number of ever-larger and more capable cargo drones is being offered primarily for commercial applications. At the same time, however, the military value of these drones in terms of aerial logistics capabilities is unquestionable.

KC-135 Tanker With Artificial Intelligence Copilot Set To Fly Nex...	An operational U.S. Air Force KC-135 tanker equipped with an artificial intelligence (AI) driven 'copilot' from autonomous flight technology company Merlin is set to take to the skies next year. The forthcoming flight testing is an important new step down a path that could lead to pilot-optional KC-135s. This also comes at a time of growing uncertainty around the Air Force's future aerial refueling plans amid serious broader concerns about how the service expects to pay for various top-priority modernization efforts. Merlin announced today that the Air Force has approved its airworthiness plan for the KC-135 fitted with its autonomy package. The company also hopes to have wrapped up the integration of what it calls the Merlin Pilot onto the tanker, as well as ground testing, by the end of the year. 'It's not going to be a test asset. It's not going to be sort of an X-plane that is out at Edwards,' Merlin founder and CEO Matt George said, referring to Edwards Air Force Base, the Air Force's top test and evaluation hubs, in an interview with The War Zone last week. 'It's going to be a real operational Air Force aircraft.' A stock picture of a US Air Force KC-135. USAF A US Air Force KC-135 tanker. USAF 'So, the fact that the Air Force has gotten comfortable and has worked with us over the past three years to get to the point of an approved airworthiness plan where we can actually implement autonomy, not just in the experimental test range world, but on the operational fleet, sounds like sort of a process thing,' George continued. 'But [it] is actually like a pretty big moment for the Air Force on taking autonomy from experimentation land and being able to start to transition that autonomy into the core force.' Merlin was founded in 2018 and has already been flight-testing its autonomy package on other smaller aircraft types, including a Cessna Caravan. Overall, the company says it has been and remains focused on an incremental approach to adding autonomous capabilities and building trust in them, focusing first on capabilities that can help reduce the workload for human aircrews. 'So the Air Force has a particular need around the tanker ecosystem, especially now that the KC 135 will be in service for the next 30 years. So a big, big portion of what General [John] Lamontagne, who is the new [Air Force] Air Mobility Command [AMC] commander, has talked about, is being able to go modernize the fleet and be able to fight with what we have versus fight with what we wish we had,' Merlin's George explained. 'So a real focus on 'how do we use today's fleet to be able to go serve, you know, tomorrow's conflicts?'' The Air Force expects to have 349 KC-135s in service by the end of Fiscal Year 2025. It's worth highlighting here that these are some of the oldest aircraft in the service's inventory and are now set to be its first operational aircraft to get a capability like the Merlin Pilot. 'For the KC-135, there's two use cases that the aircraft that the Air Force is interested in [regarding autonomy]. The first is, 'how do we use autonomy to extend the crew duty day?' So, for instance, how &#8230; could we make it possible to fly a KC-135 for 30 or 40 hours with two crew aboard. Clearly, that's not possible in an unaugmented crew [arrangement]. So can we use autonomy to be able to go back those folks up so that one crew member could be resting while the other is flying, sitting next to the autonomy system, who's acting as sort of that second pilot aboard the flight deck.' AMC has already been experimenting for some time now with operating tankers, and not just KC-135s, with skeleton crews. While doing so could offer a way to increase sortie rates and overall operational capacity, which would be especially critical in any future high-end fight, such as one in the Pacific against China, it also raises safety concerns, as The War Zone has explored in detail in the past. AI-driven 'copilots' have long been presented, in part, as a valuable tool for increasing safety margins, including by reducing task saturation and general operator fatigue, in otherwise crewed aircraft. .S.

(U.S. Air Force photo by Tech. Sgt. Heather Clements) 'So, being super-specific about the KC-135 CONOP [concept of operations], at least in the initial version, here, is the autonomy system is the pilot flying. So the autonomy system is going from takeoff to touchdown, being able to go, follow a mission plan,' George said. 'And that isn't necessarily just waypoints, but follow[ing] objectives of a mission plan, fly the airplane, do things like talk to air traffic control, be able to go manage certain sets of emergencies, do things like route around weather – which is an important part of what our tanker crews do day in and day out – to be able to execute their mission while, you know, being aware of weather and terrain and other things &#8230; like respond to, you know, other aircraft that may be non-cooperative.' 'We're working very closely with Air Mobility Command and AFRL [the Air Force Research Laboratory] to do what's called dynamic tanker repositioning,' George also added as an example of which mission autonomy in the context of the KC-135 could involve. 'So a big part of what tanker crews are doing today is coordinating with air battle managers, fighters and other [receivers]&#8230; to essentially optimally position the aircraft &#8230; to essentially meet in the middle. &#8230; especially in a dynamic mission, dynamically repositioning the tanker based off of not just where the aircraft are right now, but where the aircraft will be and where they will need fuel, is tremendously important, and we're going to be able to demonstrate some of those initial dynamic routing and capability sets, in addition to all the other autonomy features.' A KC-135 refueling F-16 fighters. USAF It's worth highlighting specific of the Merlin Pilot having some ability to engage with air traffic control is significant just for routine day-to-day flying, especially within domestic U.S. airspace. The military and commercial aviation sectors globally have been working hard for years now just on general sense-and-avoid capabilities as part of efforts to make it safer for increasingly autonomous uncrewed platforms to operate an ecosystem with crewed ones. In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) continues to place heavy restrictions on where and when completely uncrewed aircraft can operate, which was highlighted earlier this year by the appearance of the pilot-optional Model 437 Vanguard demonstrator from Northrop Grumman subsidiary Scaled Composites. For the U.S. military, having a human somewhere on the loop looks set to be a requirement for autonomous capabilities in the air and anywhere else for the foreseeable future. 'We very much believe in sort of this human-in-the-loop, on-the-loop, off-the-loop progression, and enabling during a mission the human to go from those three states depending on, you know, mission need and operational need,' Merlin's George told us. 'Because if you just say, 'hey, [the] human is going to be totally off the loop, that's not great. And if you're saying 'hey, the human has to be in the loop for everything,' that's also not super helpful.' 'So being able to have a fully functioning take-off-to-touchdown autonomy system that's able to go do everything the human pilot is able to go do in the flight deck, but enabling that human monitor to be in, on, or off, is tremendously important,' he continued. Merlin and the Air Force do have ambitions to be able to operate KC-135s in a fully uncrewed mode if desired, which is the second use case for the Merlin Pilot package being looked at now, according to the company's CEO George. He explicitly highlighted how this could also open up a new possibility for regenerating KC-135s currently sitting idle in the boneyard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona without necessarily increasing manpower requirements. KC-135s, as well as other aircraft, in storage at the Bone Yard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. kitmasterbloke via Flickr The Air Force has studied options for bringing some of those tankers back into service with the help of private contractors in the past, but has so far declined to do so. The U.S. military has been expanding its use of contractor-owned and operated tankers, including KC-135s, for non-combat missions in recent years, which helps free up organic aerial refueling capacity to support combat operations and otherwise reduces strain on those fleets. When it comes to more autonomous aerial refueling operations, whether it be with KC-135s or any other type, a major outstanding question is about actually linking up with receivers. This is even more pronounced when it comes to refueling using the boom method, which is the Air Force's preferred way of getting gas to aircraft in flight. Boom-equipped tankers today require dedicated human operators to safely make and maintain that connection. On the KC-135, that individual is physically situated looking out of the rear of the aircraft to perform this task. Boeing, the original manufacturer of the KC-135 and of the Air Force's newer KC-46s, has been working with the Air Force on more automated boom refueling capabilities, including the ability to refuel uncrewed platforms, over the years. The KC-46 notably features a remote vision system (RVS) that boom operators on those aircraft use to do their work from the aircraft's main cabin. The RVS has been beset by serious issues and is currently undergoing a complete redesign. Airbus in Europe has also been pushing forward on more advanced boom refueling capabilities requiring less human interaction. There has been significant progress with similar work involving probe-and-drogue refueling systems, as well. 'When we are talking about bringing autonomy to the tanker fleet, the autonomy has to perform as a human crew would perform. And today, the boom operator in the back of the airplane and the pilot flying the airplane are inextricably linked to each other,' Merlin's George said. 'They are flying that airplane essentially together as they're performing the mission. So, while we can't talk too much about it quite yet, we are extremely cognizant of the fact that boom autonomy is a huge part of delivering an autonomous tanking capability. 'It is something that we are actively thinking about and actively pursuing as part of the broader tanker mission autonomy system that not only are we deploying on the KC-135, but that we will likely put forward as the autonomy system for NGAS,' he added. NGAS here refers to the Air Force's Next Generation Air-refueling System effort, the requirements for which are still being finalized. NGAS is consistently described as a 'system of systems,' the core element of which has long been expected to be an entirely new stealthy tanker that might be crewed, uncrewed, or pilot-optional. However, there is now serious uncertainty around the NGAS plans as the Air Force faces worrisome concerns about the affordability of several top-priority modernization programs. A recent rendering from Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works advanced projects division of a notional stealth tanker concept in a pilotless configuration. Lockheed Martin Skunk Work Another Skunk Works rendering showing a national crewed stealth tanker concept. Lockheed Martin Skunk Works 'Essentially the threat, China again, has reached out with new counter-air systems that could threaten our aircraft, especially tankers, at longer ranges, beyond the ranges which we normally would refuel fighter planes,' Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall said in a keynote address at the Airlift/Tanker Association’s (ATA) annual symposium on Nov. 1. 'This put our whole tanker acquisition strategy in question. It is still in question, but we are working to resolve the uncertainty as quickly as possible.' 'The variable that concerns me most as we go through this analysis and produce a range of alternatives is going to be [the availability of adequate resources.] … to pursue any combination of those new designs,' Kendall also said, referring to NGAS, as well as plans for a new stealthy crewed sixth-generation combat jet and Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones as part of the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative. A notional sixth-generation stealth combat jet. Collins Aerospace This, in turn, has put new emphasis on options for increasing the survivability and other capabilities of existing tankers. 'The need for improved connectivity and some degree of enhanced self-protection measure[s] appears to be attractive from both an affordability and cost-effectiveness perspective,' Kendall added in his ATA keynote. 'It is also something that can be accomplished in relatively short time frames at relatively low cost.' The Air Force has already been experimenting with new data-sharing capabilities for the KC-135, as well as their ability to control dedicated loyal wingmen-type drones to help protect them. There has also been talk of turning them into aerial motherships for launching swarms of smaller drones. New autonomous capabilities for Air Force KC-135s is another area that the service is clearly continuing to invest in. Merlin's existing work for the Air Force is not limited to the KC-135 or NGAS, either, and could also feed into broader autonomy efforts across the service and the rest of the U.S. military. The company is also on contract with U.S. Special Operations Command to demonstrate the Merlin Pilot integrated onto a C-130-type aircraft. Air Force MC-130J special operations tanker/transport aircraft, like the one seen here, could also benefit from the Merlin Pilot's capabilities in the future. Sierra Nevada Corporation An AFSOC MC-130J Commando II. This particular example has gone through a number of recent upgrade programs, including one that adds the new Silent Knight terrain-following/terrain avoidance radar to the nose. Sierra Nevada Corporation 'So clearly, each different type of aircraft has different vehicle-level autonomy, and they clearly have slightly different missions, Right? An F-16 has a very different mission than the KC-135 which has a very different mission than an AC-130J, which has a very, very different mission than a B-52,' Merlin CEO George said. 'But across those airplanes, the flight autonomy bit, right, the aviate, navigate, communicate, fly the airplane while executing on the mission [bit], is fairly common.' 'In our opinion, the KC-135 [work] is even more important as a core maturation sandbox for flight autonomy across the force, especially as the Air Force moves into a much more integrated sort of core capability developer,' he continued. Altogether, an interesting future for the Air Force's venerable KC-135s continues to take shape, which may have implications, especially when it comes to autonomous capabilities, that stretch well beyond those tankers.

Russia’s 50,000-Soldier-Strong Push To Kick Ukraine Out Of Kursk ...	Vladimir Putin’s much-anticipated second counteroffensive against the three-month-old Ukrainian occupation of Russia’s Kursk region appears to be underway in a much larger fashion than the one launched in September. This time, not only are there far more Russian troops, but there appears to be the first deployment of a significant number of North Korean troops in combat on Russia's behalf as well. 'They are now doing the order of their military leadership, trying to push our troops out and push deep into the territory we hold,' Col.-Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, Commander-in-Chief of Ukraine’s Armed Forces, announced on Facebook Monday after visiting the region. The commander of Ukraine's Armed Forces, Col.-Gen. Oleksandr Syskyi said he visited troops in Russia's Kursk region. (Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff) To end this invasion, which Ukrainian officials say has occupied about 500 square miles of territory, Russia has amassed about 50,000 troops, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Monday. That includes some from North Korea, The New York Times reported on Sunday, citing U.S. and Ukrainian officials. In the Kursk region, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are holding back a 50,000-strong enemy group, Zelenskyi in a night address'By the end of the year, European partners should have time to fully implement the initiative to supply 1 million shells for our artillery.' pic.twitter.com/h202C4Fjlh&mdash; MilitaryNewsUA (@front_ukrainian) November 11, 2024 Ukraine had been steadily losing ground in Kursk since September after Russia launched a previous attempt to kick them out. However, they've largely managed to hold ground in recent weeks, while significant parts of the Kursk battleground remain in flux and controlled by neither side. Whether this counteroffensive will result in large thrusts or chipping away at Ukrainian positions is unclear at the moment. Attacks seemed to have increased in the past few days, with Russian forces attempting to chew off pieces of the Ukrainian salient from several directions. 'Obviously, they will try to take back as much territory as possible' Rob Lee, a Russian military specialist at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia who recently returned from a visit to Ukraine, told us. 'But, given the quality of the Ukrainian units there, we may see Russia continue to chip away and make incremental advances.' Statements from Ukrainian troops and video from the battlefield indicate Russia has taken heavy losses in so-called 'meat attacks,' similar to how they’ve fought in eastern Ukraine. 'During two days of assault, the enemy did nothing except destroy their units and equipment, namely 28 units of the enemy's equipment and more than 100 [Russians] from the 810th brigade of the Russian marines,' Ukraine's 95th Brigade claimed on Telegram. 'But about a hundred more occupiers were seriously injured on the territory of Kursk. Our paratroopers repelled the desire of the Russians to continue the assault - the [Russians] began to retreat, but not all succeeded.' The War Zone cannot independently verify that claim.

The high quality of forces Kyiv has committed to Kursk has created a conundrum for Ukraine's thinly stretched military. In his message on Monday, Syrskyi claimed the invasion forced Russia to pull troops from the fight inside Ukraine. 'If not for the resilience of our soldiers, these tens of thousands of enemies from the best Russian strike units would storm our positions in the Pokrovsk, Kurakhove or Toretsk directions, which would significantly worsen the situation on the frontlines,' he said. However, U.S. officials have a different view. 'A new U.S. assessment concludes that Russia has massed the force without having to pull soldiers out of Ukraine’s east — its main battlefield priority — allowing Moscow to press on multiple fronts simultaneously,' The New York Times reported. Adding validity to that assessment, Russian troops continue to make gains in eastern Ukraine, especially near Kurakhove in the Donetsk region. 'The enemy continues to implement his large-scale plan to envelop the city, entering from the flanks,' the Ukrainian DeepState open-source intelligence collective stated on Telegram Monday. 'As we noted earlier, [the Russians], having increased the pressure from new directions, are trying to enter the logistical routes of the Defense Forces, and from that moment on, this process is only gaining momentum. As of today, Muscovites are storming the positions of the Ukrainian military from the north, south and east:' 'We have to remind once again that ‘lies will destroy us all,’' DeepState complained. 'But even in attracting additional resources that arrive in the Kurakhove region, questions of the adequacy of the deployment arise. With such actions, the loss of control over Kurakhove remains a matter of time. And if the problem with the flanks is not taken under control, then very soon it will turn into another disaster.' DeepState reports difficult situation around Kurakhove, which could become catastrophic Ukrainska Pravda in English (@pravda_eng) November 11, 2024 As part of their advance, Russian forces have damaged the Kurakhove dam, according to the regional governor. 'This strike potentially threatens residents of settlements on the Vovchii River, both in Donetsk region and in Dnipro region,' Vadym Filashkin said on Telegram. In mid September we crossed the dam over the Kurakhove reservoir several times. And each time we crossed it, it got more destroyed by the Russians.

Syrskyi’s strategy 'raises questions among some military personnel who do not understand why resources are being directed to the Kursk region while the defense in the Donbas is weakening,' the Spanish El Pais newspaper posited, citing an interview with a former Ukrainian commander. 'Perhaps our leaders have some big secret plan, otherwise I don't understand why our best brigades are in Kursk region, while our ‘defense’ in Ukraine is falling apart,' the newspaper quotes Ukrainian Maj. Gen. Dmitry Marchenko, who recently announced his dismissal from the army. Making matters worse for Ukraine, there are about 10,000 North Korean troops in Kursk, according to the Pentagon. They are part of a cadre of what the head of the Ukrainian Defense Intelligence Directorate told us was some 12,000 of Pyongyang’s soldiers in Russia. There are fresh claims that the North Koreans are involved in the fighting. 'North Korean troops were taking part in direct combat operations in Kursk, as well as defensive operations in the neighboring Belgorod region of Russia and in Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories,' a Ukrainian commander told CNN Sunday. 'Mostly, the tasks are defined as the second echelon of defense. In the Kursk region, these are direct combat operations,' he said, adding that among the personnel were specialist artillerymen and snipers.' The North Korean troops were a 'significant resource' for Russia’s war on Ukraine, the commander continued, noting that even those being deployed defensively would free up Russian troops for assault operations elsewhere and would themselves eventually be used in direct combat.

'It depends on where Ukraine chooses to prioritize,' Rob Lee suggested to us. 'Kursk clearly remains a priority given the size of the force and the quality of the units committed there. The operation has stretched Ukrainian forces and has likely contributed to Russia's increased rate of advance elsewhere on the front line.' 'Russia,' he added, 'will likely continue to try to push Ukrainian forces out of Kursk while also continuing offensive operations elsewhere on the front. A potential offensive from Zaporizhzhia could stretch Ukrainian forces even more.' All this comes against the backdrop of political change in the U.S, Ukraine's biggest backer. On Jan. 20, 2025, Donald J. Trump will once again become president. While the mercurial Trump claims he can quickly end the war in a plan he has yet to make public, there are concerns that he might abandon Ukraine if such a deal is not accepted by Kyiv. However, the issue is far more nuanced and complex, as we noted in our deep dive on the subject which you can read more about here. When it comes to U.S. involvement with Ukraine, President-elect Donald Trump will shuffle the deck. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Chip Somodevilla As we previously reported, Zelensky sees Kursk as a bargaining chip. 'Our operation is aimed to restore our territorial integrity,' Zelensky said in early September. 'We capture Russian troops to replace them with the Ukrainians. The same attitude is to the territories. We don’t need their land.' Unfortunately for Ukraine, Zelensky is playing a steadily weakening hand. While both sides are struggling to meet recruiting goals, Russia has a far larger pool to pull from and is regenerating its forces more quickly. Meanwhile, should North Korean troops see success on the battlefield, Kim Jong-un could send tens of thousands more to Russia, not just for fighting in Kursk, but also in Ukraine. One Western official told the Times that the Kursk invasion 'thinned out its forces across the battlefield in eastern Ukraine, leaving them vulnerable to Russian advances. But that official, and U.S. officials, said Ukraine still had a strong defense in Kursk and might be able to hold, at least for a time.' Though Ukraine continues to lose troops and territory, Zelensky will likely do whatever he can to keep Kursk contested until Trump takes office and negotiations can begin.

Chinese Hypersonic Boost Glide Vehicle Concept That Launches Its ...	A new Chinese concept for an unpowered hypersonic boost-glide weapon loaded with different types of submunitions, including supersonic missiles and drones, has emerged. Boost-glide vehicles already present significant challenges for defenders and one loaded with various sub-payloads could carry out kinetic strikes and non-kinetic operations like electronic warfare, as well as reconnaissance, against multiple targets across a broader area. While a weapon of this kind could present numerous benefits and additional complications for defenders, releasing payloads from a platform traveling at hypersonic speed also presents substantial technological challenges. A model of the new unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicle concept, called the GDF-600, and some of its payloads are on display at this year's Zhuhai Airshow in China, which formally opens tomorrow. The design comes from the Guangdong Aerodynamic Research Academy (GARA). GARA previously came to more widespread attention in 2022 with its unveiling of the MD-22, ostensibly an uncrewed hypersonic testbed details about which remain limited, at that year's Zhuhai Airshow.

The vehicle is said to be able to reach a peak speed of Mach 7 and have a maximum range of between approximately 124 and 370 miles (200 and 600 kilometers). Hypersonic speed is typically defined as anything above Mach 5. GARA has put forward five different potential payload types for the GDF-600: supersonic and subsonic missiles, a 'patrol projectile' (which appears to be a loitering munition or kamikaze drone), an uncrewed aerial system (UAS), and an unpowered kinetic strike munition. The GDF-600 model shows a mixed load of six 'patrol projectiles,' six UAS, and 13 subsonic missiles. GDF-600 3/3 pic.twitter.com/X3XN79NjZf&mdash; Michael Jerdev (@MuxelAero) November 10, 2024 Unpowered boost-glide vehicles, in general, use some means to get to an optimal speed and altitude via a rocket booster, before soaring back down to their target. The weapon's range is dependent in part on how high and fast it gets to begin with and GARA says the GDF-600's trajectory can crest at up to some 131,233.5 feet (40 kilometers). There does not appear to be any specific mention of a particular launch platform for the GDF-600, but it could be adaptable to a ground, air, and/or sea-based weapon system. Hypersonic boost-glide weapons also glide along largely shallow atmospheric flight paths to their targets and are capable of making erratic movements along the way. The combination of speed and maneuverability creates significant complications for defenders, including just reducing the total amount of time available to react at all, let alone attempt an intercept. A graphic showing, in a very rudimentary way, the difference in trajectories between a traditional ballistic missile and a hypersonic boost-glide vehicle. Depictions of typical trajectories for aeroballistic (or quasi-ballistic) missiles and air-breathing hypersonic cruise missiles are also provided. GAO The value of the additional ability to release sub-payloads, potentially at several points along the boost-glide vehicle's flight path, is clear. A single boost-glide weapon would therefore have the ability to strike multiple targets (and different target sets) and do so across a broad area. The sub-payloads, especially drones, could be configured to carry out electronic warfare and other non-kinetic attacks and/or perform other tasks, including immediate bomb damage assessment and reconnaissance, as well as just acting as decoys. All of this only increases the challenges for defenders. In addition, some of the submunition types GARA has put forward would have the ability to substantially increase the overall range of the complete system. It says that the supersonic missiles could be able to travel up to 310 miles (500 kilometers) from their launch point. If they were released in the terminal phase of the GDF-600's flight, this could almost double the range of the entire weapon. The sub-payloads at that point would also have benefited from the boost-glide vehicle's initial penetration through layers of an enemy's air and missile defense network. As described now, especially given its range, the GDF-600 would seem more optimized for employment in a more regional context, such as a Taiwan Strait or South China Sea scenario. However, GARA claims its new submunition-laden hypersonic glide vehicle concept could be scaled up to a design offering an intercontinental range of up to 3,728 miles (6,000 kilometers). It's interesting to note here that the U.S. Army has been looking into the possibility of adding submunition payloads, including small drones, to future iterations of its Precision Strike Missile (PrSM). The PrSM is a short-range ballistic missile that could also evolve into a longer-range weapon. The PrSM is set to replace the Army Tactical Missile System (ATAMCS) short-range ballistic missile in Army service, which was also originally designed to carry a traditional cluster munition warhead with hundreds of small bomblets. A US Army Briefing slide that discusses a drone swarm payload for the PrSM, among other weapons. US Army At the same time, it is unclear how advanced GARA's work on the GDF-600 might be at this time. Launching payloads from something traveling at hypersonic speeds presents its own relatively massive technological challenges, particularly due to physical and thermal stresses, especially at the time of separation. More fragile payloads like drones would require some means of safely slowing down to subsonic speeds first. A high-speed picture showing submunitions being released from a US Army weapon system at supersonic speed during a test using the Holloman High Speed Test Track at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico. USAF Wedge-shaped hypersonic boost-glide vehicles are also understood to be more complex to begin with than conical types. The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) has operationally fielded at least one wedge-shaped hypersonic boost-glide vehicle weapon that is launched from the ground via a missile-like booster, the DF-17. The U.S. government also says that China has successfully tested a novel nuclear-capable orbital weapon system that includes a hypersonic glide vehicle capable of launching sub-payloads, which also underscores a general interest in the kinds of capabilities the GDF-600 could offer. A top-down look at two of the DF-17 mockups on parade in 2019. China Military Online DF-17 mockups on parade in Beijing in 2019. China Military If nothing else, the GDF-600 reflects the PLA's significant and still-growing investments in the development and fielding of hypersonic weapons, including air and ship-launched types. This also now comes as the U.S. military has faced significant issues in its own work in this regard, especially when it comes to hypersonic boost-glide vehicle designs. The future of the U.S. Air Force's AGM-183A Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW), or a potential follow-on program, remains notably murky. The U.S. Army has also faced setbacks with its Dark Eagle hypersonic missile program, a weapon the service being developed in cooperation with the U.S. Navy. The GDF-600, if it becomes a reality, could be an important new step for China's hypersonic arsenal.

New Version Of Chinese PL-15 Air-To-Air Missile Tailored For Stea...	China’s PL-15 active-radar-guided air-to-air missile has been reworked for improved internal carriage in the country’s stealth fighters, the Chengdu J-20 and the Shenyang J-35. This development is significant, with the promise that these fighters should, in the future, be able to carry larger loads of longer-reaching missiles while maintaining their low-observable characteristics. Full-size mock-ups of the revised PL-15E were unveiled at the China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition, better known as Airshow China, in Zhuhai. While the event doesn’t officially open until tomorrow, it has already sprung various surprises, including new versions of land-based and carrier fighters seen for the first time and at least one previously unseen drone.

The cruciform tail fins now simply fold around the midway point, deploying once the missile is released from the aircraft. Meanwhile, the cruciform center-body fins are of reduced span compared to those on the original missile. The PL-15E was displayed next to a short-range infrared-guided PL-10E air-to-air missile, in front of a mockup of the recently revealed J-35A stealth fighter and again in front of a mockup of the two-seat J-20S stealth fighter.

Photo by Ruan Yulin/China News Service/VCG via Getty Images China News Service Already, the basic PL-15 can fit in the weapons bays of the J-20, at least. From the start, it appears the missile was tailored for internal carriage, with the original version already having distinctive cropped fins to reduce its dimensions, similar to the changes introduced on the American AIM-120C. Close-up of a J-20 fighter carrying four inert examples of the original PL-15 in its main ventral bays. via Chinese Internet The new PL-15E, therefore, is likely designed to be better accommodated in the weapons bay of the smaller J-35, and intended to increase the number of medium-range missiles that the J-20 can carry. Currently, four of the standard PL-15s can be carried in the J-20’s internal weapons bay. Both those possibilities could also be true, with the PL-15E providing a dedicated internal medium-range air-to-air weapon for the J-35, and a way of accommodating more missiles internally in the J-20. While we have not seen inside the weapons bay of the J-35 thus far, there are indications that it is scaled to carry six medium-range air-to-air missiles — very likely the compressed-carriage PL-15E version.

At the 2021 Airshow China, a PL-15E was also exhibited, described as an export version. Apart from a slightly reduced range, this was otherwise similar in appearance to the basic PL-15. PL-15 air-to-air missile features an active electronically scanned array radar seeker and has a range exceeding 200 km. In Zhuhai air show 2021,China presented an export variant of PL-15 named PL-15E with a maximum range of 145km. #AirshowChina2021 pic.twitter.com/6gWSTD5cdI&mdash; 彩云香江 (@louischeung_hk) October 1, 2021 As you can read about in our in-depth story on Chinese air-to-air missiles, the PL-15 is China’s standard active-radar-guided AAM and it apparently was intended to at least match the performance of the U.S.-made AIM-120D. The PL-15 has a dual-pulse rocket motor that provides a reported range of 124 miles. Another important feature is a two-way datalink that allows the launching aircraft to provide guidance updates to the missile. The missile seeker uses active electronically scanned array (AESA) technology, with active and passive modes, and it’s claimed to have better resistance to countermeasures than previous Chinese air-to-air missiles. The typical air-to-air load-out for the J-10 (like this J-10C) comprises PL-15 (inboard) and PL-10 (outboard) AAMs. via Chinese internet As well as being the main armament of the J-20, the PL-15 is now also used by most other modern Chinese fighters, including the J-10C, J-11B, J-15, and J-16. The first export operator was Pakistan, which acquired PL-15s for its JF-17 Block III and J-10C fighters. All in all, the PL-15 — even in its basic form — is widely assessed as being a very capable air-to-air missile and one that is likely superior in some respects to certain Western equivalents. The Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) defense and security think tank determines that the PL-15 'out-ranges the U.S.-made AIM-120C/D AMRAAM series and has a comparable maximum range to the Meteor.' Reflecting this, the development and fielding of the PL-15 has been a major driver behind the United States launching a program of improvements for its AIM-120D, creating a stopgap weapon before the new long-range AIM-260 enters widespread service. The AIM-260 program itself was also largely a response to Chinese AAM developments. In the meantime, the U.S. Navy’s AIM-174 air-to-air missile is also seen as a direct counter to China, to make full use of so-called kill webs for very long-range engagements in the Pacific theater. As well as working on secretive new range air-to-air missiles, the United States has also been looking at ways to increase the ‘magazine depth’ of its existing fighters, specifically adding more missiles to the F-22 and F-35, which are constrained by their internal weapons carriage — provided they are to retain their critical low-observability advantage. In the air-to-air configuration, the F-22 carries six AMRAAMs and two AIM-9 Sidewinders. However, the F-35 can only carry four internal AMRAAMs, which led to a program to develop the Sidekick weapons bay adapter, which will boost the number of internal AMRAAMs a Joint Strike Fighter can carry to six. The United States has also been working on more radical ways of increasing internal air-to-air missile capacity. The Raytheon Peregrine is a design for a new medium-range missile that combines superior performance with small size, potentially doubling the number of missiles that an F-35 or F-22 can carry internally. Concept art of the Peregrine missile, being launched by an F-22. Raytheon www.twz.com A similar miniaturized beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile, Lockheed Martin’s Cuda, was promoted in the early 2010s, though more recently it seems to have largely disappeared from the company’s marketing. It seems that Cuda would have been a shorter-range weapon than AMRAAM and would utilize a hit-to-kill design to help reduce its dimensions. It would be surprising if China, too, isn’t working on all-new air-to-air missiles that are optimized for internal carriage. In the meantime, however, it seems the PL-15 has been further optimized to arm both the J-20 and J-35 as China continues on its path of stealth fighter development — as well as the appropriate weapons to arm these aircraft.

North Korea’s Wacky Type 73 Machine Guns May Be Entering The Figh...	The peculiar North Korean Type 73 machine gun is getting new attention as a result of the Hermit Kingdom's expanding support for Russia's war in Ukraine, which now includes the deployment of thousands of troops. The weapon, chambered in the Russian 7.62x54mmR cartridge, is a unique blending of Cold War Soviet and Czech designs. Pictures showing Type 73s, which are said to have been taken in Russia's Kursk region recently, first began circulating online yesterday. There are competing unconfirmed reports that North Korean troops may have brought the guns with them or that Pyongyang is supplying them as military aid to Russian forces. Russia is known to have received various weaponry from North Korea already, including KN-23 short-range ballistic missiles, Bulsae-4 anti-tank missile vehicles, and rocket-propelled grenades, along with millions of artillery round and various kinds of other ammunition. Photos circulating on telegram this afternoon, of North Korean Type 73s said to be in Russia (the EMR trousers leg supports that). Various posts claiming A.

The North Korean gun combines design elements from at least three different machine guns: the Czech 7.62x39mm Vz. 52/57 machine gun and the Soviet 7.62x54mmR Soviet RP-46 (itself a belt-fed version of the Soviet DP family) and PK series. A Czech Vz. 52 machine gun in a museum in Israel. The main difference between the Vz. 52 and the 52/57 variant is the switch from the Czech 7.62x45mm caliber to the Soviet 7.62x39mm. Bukvoed via Wikimedia A Soviet DP-27 machine gun in a museum in Finland. The RP-46 is a belt-fed version of this gun. MKFI A member of the US Army fires a PK-type machine gun during training. US Army What is most immediately notable about the roughly 22-pound (empty) and four-foot-long Type 73 is that it can feed from a top-mounted box magazine (like the Vz. 52/57) or a belt of ammunition loaded in from the right side (also like the Vz. 52/57, as well as the RP-46 and PK). When used with a box magazine, the gun has an especially archaic look reminiscent of designs dating back to even before World War II like the Czech ZB-26 and the British Bren. The Bren, as well as Vz. 52/57, were themselves derived from the ZB-26. The Type 73's unusual features also include a muzzle device that allows for the firing of rifle grenades. When that capability isn't in use, a cover that includes a muzzle brake can be screwed onto the front end of the gun's nearly two-foot-long barrel. A picture of a Type 73 machine gun said to have been taken in Russia. This example has the screw-on cover fitted over the front end of the barrel. via X Believed to have entered North Korean service in 1973, hard details about the Type 73 and its development remain scant. 'Frankly, this is the result of&#8230; several of North Korea's previous leaders, Kim Jong Il and Kim Il Sung, both being &#8230; like actually gun guys. And they were both big fans of Czechoslovakian firearms in particular,' firearms expert Ian McCollum, who runs the Forgotten Weapons website, said in a video on the Type 73 back in 2022, which you can watch in full below. There is a certain logic behind the design. Ammunition belts can be cumbersome for units to carry during active operations or even localized patrols. A box magazine, while offering less immediate ammunition capacity, would help make the gun easier to handle on the move, including when firing from the shoulder. At 22 pounds empty, the Type 73 is just over two pounds heavier than a typical current-generation Russian PKM, but is substantially lighter than the U.S. Army's standard 7.62x51mm M240B light machine gun, which tips the scales at nearly 28 pounds before a belt of ammunition is even loaded. A top-mounted magazine also allows the gunner to get and stay lower to the ground while firing from a prone position without sacrificing capacity. 'So the concept here was you would carry this with a box magazine in it for any sort of immediate action that might be necessary, for example, on a patrol or something,' McCollum says in his 2022 video. 'And then, if you got into a position where you actually had to be using the gun for sustained fire, that's when you would instead start feeding it belts.' A North Korean soldier fires a Type 73 using the magazine feed option. North Korean State Media Again, while information is limited, the Type 73 does not appear to have been overly popular in North Korean service. 'Frankly, the Czech 52/57 wasn't really all that successful, either. The concept of belt or magazine dual-feed systems never really took off. As far as I can tell, it's something that&#8230; sounded better on paper than it actually was in practice. And it turned out people just always wanted to go with the belts,' according to McCollum. 'And so having the magazine feed was sort of an extraneous complication to the gun. It made them more expensive to manufacture. It gives you extra openings for dirt to get in other potential malfunctions and all that sort of stuff.' By the 1980s, the North Koreans had developed a new Type 82 machine gun, which is a PK-series clone. The PK family has been and continues to be one of the most popular light machine gun designs globally. Variants of that design are in widespread service on both sides of the war in Ukraine. 'It seems that many Type 73s were moved to reserve or militia service, but nobody can be sure,' Dan Shea and Heebum Hong wrote in an article for Small Arms Defense Journal in 2013. 'While it could sometimes be seen in 1970s propaganda and at military parades, from the early 1980s it’s been more and more difficult to see one in use.' North Korean soldiers fire Type 73 machine guns, including a silver-colored one, likely intended for parade or other ceremonial use. North Korean State Media Before now, Type 73 has appeared outside of North Korea only in relatively small numbers and largely due to Iran, which acquired some number of the guns during the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s. The guns have since shown up in the hands of Iranian proxies in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, as well as with militant groups in Africa. An Iraqi militiaman circa the mid-2010s with a Type 73 machine gun. via X Between 2016 and 2017, Australian and French forces seized a number of Type 73s during maritime interdiction operations in and around the Arabian Sea. Some official and other expert sources at the time described them as being variants or derivatives of the Soviet RPD light machine gun design, underscoring just how rare they are to see outside of North Korea. A picture of a Type 73 seized somewhere in the Arabian Sea in 2016 mistakenly identified as an 'RPD-pattern light machine gun.' Conflict Armament Research For Russian forces, an influx of any additional machine guns, especially ones that use a widely available ammunition type, could be something of a boon. The conflict in Ukraine has already seen both sides make use of older and ostensibly obsolete weapons, including machine guns dating back to World War II or before, to help bolster their arsenals. If North Korean Type 73s are indeed being fielded to Russian units or are otherwise being actively used in Russia's war against Ukraine, new details about the guns, including how the design performs in actual combat, may now start to emerge.

Our Best Look Yet China’s New Stealthy Trimaran Drone Ship	Clearer views of a new stealthy Chinese trimaran uncrewed surface vessel (USV) have emerged, highlighting a number of interesting features, including a vertical launch system (VLS) array and aft-end flight deck for drone helicopters. New images of the stealthy USV, which look to have been taken at or near ground level, first began circulating online last week. A surge in interest in the drone ship had followed its appearance in high-resolution satellite imagery of Guangzhou Shipyard International (GSI) facilities on Longxue Island just southeast of the city of Guangzhou earlier in the year. The same imagery also revealed a still mysterious new class of Chinese ship with a large open flight deck. You can read our report on it here.

Chinese aviation firms have been separately developing a growing number of uncrewed helicopters, including ones configured for naval applications. Overall, the core shape of the mast and other portions of the ship's external structure, at least, point to radar signature-reducing design considerations. By all indications, the new Chinese trimaran USV is the JARI-USV-A, a 300-ton displacement design that has reportedly been under construction in Guangzhou since 2022. Huangpu Shipyard may be the actual builder, according to a recent report from Naval News. Huangpu and GSI are both subsidiaries of the state-run China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC). 'JARI' in the name also refers to comes from the Jiangsu Automation Research Institute, which has also been involved in the development of a smaller 20-ton-displacement JARI-USV with traditional hull profile. JARI was originally established as part of the state-owned China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation (CSIC), which CSSC absorbed in 2019. Interestingly the final configuration appears to be somewhat closer to the 'Jari-USV-A' (not the Jari) concept model shown years ago vs the graphic shown at launch of the project. pic.twitter.com/WbjrzkekzH&mdash; Alex Luck (@AlexLuck9) October 28, 2024 Another unrelated trimaran USV design had previously emerged in China in 2020. However, the USV now sitting in GSI's yard differs in significant ways from models and renders of the JARI-USV-A that have been shown in the past, which notably featured an eight-cell VLS array in a much lower-profile main superstructure. The earlier design also had what looked to be torpedo tubes nestled in its side sponsons and a remotely-operated weapon system with a gun and missile launchers that could be fully retracted into a section of the bow. Whether or not these features have been carried over to the newer design is unknown. Satellite imagery of China's JARI USV (trimaran version). The hull seems completed.

It could also be used as a network relay and kinetic platform, as well. The USVs could also just offer valuable additional capacity to provide localized maritime presence, including around more far-flung outposts like China's man-made islands in the hotly contested South China Sea. Its shallow draft would make it very well suited for operations in littoral area.s Similarly sized crewed Type 022 catarman missile boats are among the assets the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) currently uses for those kinds of missions. A Type 022 missile boat. PLAN Whether or not the new USV is expected to be an operational platform, or just a testbed for future developments, is unclear. Naval News posited that the trimaran drone ship, as well as the new carrier-like ship in GSI's yard (which we've now seen curiously bears the CSSC company logo rather than clear naval-style markings), could be more experimental in nature and also intended in part to help with export pitches to foreign navies. Similar questions have been raised about exact the intended purposes of the trimaran USV design that previously emerged in China, as well as a new stealthy crewed corvette design that first broke cover in the country last year. A look at the other known Chinese trimaran USV design. Chinese Internet The PLAN certainly does have a history of building bespoke vessels ostensibly for research and development, test and evaluation, and training roles. At the same time, from what we have now seen, the new USV has a configuration that is at least potentially operationally representative and that could point to the possibility of a future fleet of operational drone ships based on this design. Even if the new trimaran drone ship is ostensibly a test platform, it underscores the PLAN's clear ambitions (and those of the rest of the PLA) to increase its uncrewed capabilities across all domains. The PLAN has been very actively working to expand the scale and scope of its crewed surface warship and submarine capabilities in recent years, backed by China's substantial shipbuilding industrial base. In this broader context, it is also worth noting that China's public interest in trimaran USVs emerged following the U.S. military's highly successful work with a design called Sea Hunter. The U.S. Navy still has that USV, as well as a second example named Seahawk, but has so far not moved to acquire more of them for operational use. The service has been working to operationalize other USVs in recent years, but the main focus so far has been on smaller and less capable designs. Testbed or not, the new Chinese USV is the latest evidence that the coutnry continues to push ahead with its own increasingly more advanced uncrewed naval capabilities.

U.S. Contractors Will Be Allowed To Fix F-16s, Patriots In Ukrain...	In a major policy change, the Biden administration will now allow U.S. contractors on the ground in Ukraine to help its military maintain and repair some of the $61 billion worth of weapons donated by America, CNN reported. In particular, the shift is designed to help keep F-16 Vipers and Patriot air defense batteries in working order. Until this decision, the Biden administration has allowed only a small number of U.S. troops in Ukraine, mainly to help keep tabs of U.S. donated equipment, but no Defense Department (DoD) civilian contractors. However, there are a number of U.S. contractors working in Ukraine directly for that country. More here: Natasha Bertrand (@NatashaBertrand) November 8, 2024 The move was approved earlier this month, CNN reported, citing 'an official with direct knowledge.' 'In order to help Ukraine repair and maintain military equipment provided by the US and its allies, DoD is soliciting bids for a small number of contractors who will help Ukraine maintain the assistance we’ve already provided,' a defense official told the network. Continuing its sensitivity toward escalating the conflict and angering Moscow, the Biden administration won’t allow those contractors anywhere near the fighting. 'These contractors will be located far from the front lines and they will not be fighting Russian forces,' the official told CNN. 'They will help Ukrainian Armed Forces rapidly repair and maintain U.S.-provided equipment as needed so it can be quickly returned to the front lines.' The change of heart came about because several of the systems provided to Ukraine - particularly F-16s and Patriots - 'require specific technical expertise to maintain,' the defense official said. The U.S. has not provided any F-16s to Ukraine, but has signed off on allowing a coalition of nations to transfer upwards of 85 of the U.S.-made fourth-generation fighters. The Pentagon has provided three U.S.-made Patriot batteries to Ukraine. Other allies have as well. Ukrainian personnel remove camouflage netting from a Patriot launcher, which is loaded with missile canisters associated with older interceptors like the PAC-2-series. Ukrainian Air Force Ukrainian Air Force Ukrainian personnel remove camouflage netting from a Patriot launcher, which is loaded with missile canisters associated with older interceptors like the PAC-2-series. Ukrainian Air Force After nearly three years of extremely heavy fighting, much of the equipment provided to Ukraine has worn down or been damaged and in need of repair. The Biden administration’s refusal to allow experienced U.S. contractors to work in Ukraine meant that the equipment had to be hauled out of the country and repaired in Poland, Romania or other NATO nations, or be done with remote help via video chat or secure phone. Both situations are suboptimal, creating delays in getting the weapons back into the fight or limiting the work that could be done in-country remotely. This is especially true for F-16s and Patriots, two very complex systems that require a high degree of maintenance by skilled technicians. Though these contractors will be far from the front lines, being in Ukraine has risks as Russia has raked the whole country with missiles and drones, To address that, companies bidding on contracts will be required to develop 'robust risk mitigation plans,' officials told CNN. Companies bidding for the contracts would be required to develop robust risk mitigation plans to reduce threats to their employees, officials told CNN. 'The Department made this decision after careful risk assessment and in coordination with interagency stakeholders,' the defense official said. 'Each US contractor, organization or company will be responsible for the safety and security of their employees and will be required to include risk mitigation plans as part of their bids.'

(Photo by George Frey/Getty Images) George Frey Unlike the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq where thousands of contractors lived in those countries on sprawling bases, this effort will be limited to between a few dozen and a couple of hundred personnel at a time. 'It is worth noting that there already are a wide array of American companies who have personnel in Ukraine fulfilling contracts for the Ukrainian government, so this will not lead to a substantial increase of employees of U.S. companies working on the ground in Ukraine,' the defense official told CNN. The officials said this new plan was launched before Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris was trounced in Tuesday’s election loss to now-President-elect Donald Trump. A huge wildcard here is whether the incoming administration continues this policy, something that is not a given considering Trump’s reticence about continuing support for Ukraine and in general keeping the U.S. involved in overseas conflicts. This move also comes as the lame-duck Biden administration is rushing to move some $6 billion worth of military aid to Ukraine before it has to pack up on Jan. 20. You can read more about what his second administration could mean for the war in Ukraine in our deep dive here. Whether these contracts can make it through the various hoops required for spending tax dollars for war efforts before Trump is sworn in remains to be seen. Trump's ultimate decision on risking the injury or death of U.S. personnel in Ukraine - or incurring the wrath of Russian President Vladimir Putin - is the biggest factor in how far this new program can progress.

Russia’s S-70 Hunter Flying Wing Drone Downed In Ukraine Packed W...	Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR) claims it has found dozens of Western-made components in the Russian S-70 Okhotnik-B (Hunter-B) flying wing unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) downed last month in a case of friendly fire. 'The aggressor state, despite sanctions, used components manufactured by Western companies to create this weapon,' GUR said on Telegram Friday. 'In particular, microelectronics and other technological components manufactured by the companies Analog Devices, Texas Instruments and Xilinx-AMD (USA), Infineon Technologies (Germany), STMicroelectronics (Switzerland) were found in the Russian S-70 Hunter.' GUR found components from several other companies as well. Ukraine's Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR) claims this wreckage of a Russian S-70 Hunter-B flying wing unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) contained at least 30 Western components. (GUR) The S-70 is a heavy-weight strike and reconnaissance tactical drone with some low observable (stealthy) features. It was also envisioned to be able to partake in air-to-air as well as air-to-ground combat and reconnaissance duties. Independent operations and those paired with other aircraft, both manned and unmanned, are envisioned for the type. GUR said the drone that went down in Ukraine was the fourth S-70 prototype. The directorate, which maintains a database of thousands of foreign components found in Russian weapons, published a list of 30 found in the S-70. Among them was a motor driver with a built-in current sensor made by Maxim Integrated Products, a transistor made by Infineon Technologies, a microprocessor made by Xilinx Inc, a power module made by Texas Instruments, an isolator made by Analog Devices and a microprocessor made by STMicroelectronics. There were dozens of other components from these and several other companies found as well. Maxim Current Sensor (GUR) Xilinkx microprocessor. (GUR) Russian weapons 'depend on foreign components,' GUR stated on its database. 'Without them, they cannot continue to fight, occupy and kill.' All told, GUR said it has found more than 4,000 foriegn components in nearly 150 captured or recovered Russian weapons. The discovery of those in the S-70 marks the latest example of how Russia is evading sanctions placed on it after launching its all-out war on Ukraine. The origin of those on the S-70 is unclear and GUR provided no futher information about how they were obtained by Russia. These would not necessarily have to have been sourced directly from the manufacturers, however. Also, there is a massive and largely unregulated market for recycled chips, largely emanating from China. In addition, many components are found in appliances and other non-military items. While those are harder to prevent falling into the wrong hands, U.S. officials have the authority to prevent shipments of those dual-use chips if they consider the application to have critical military uses. S-70 Okhotnik-B (Hunter-B) flying wing unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV). Russian MOD Screenshot/via X.com To help stem the flow of military technology to Russia, U.S. government agencies have issued sanctions against hundreds of companies around the world providing Russia with technology. Last month, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned 275 individuals and entities 'involved in supplying Russia with advanced technology and equipment that it desperately needs to support its war machine,' the department said in a media release. The 'action targets both individual actors and sprawling sanctions evasion networks across 17 jurisdictions, including India, the People’s Republic of China (PRC), Switzerland, Thailand, and Türkiye. In addition to disrupting global evasion networks, this action also targets domestic Russian importers and producers of key inputs and other materiel for Russia’s military-industrial base.' On Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury Department announced another round of sanctions against Russian officials. OFAC's designations include several Russian deputy defense ministers, including Anna Tsivileva, Vladimir Putin’s second cousin. Meduza in English (@meduza_en) October 31, 2024 There is no indication, however, that any of the chips in the S-70 violated any provisions. Moreover, the UCAV had been in development for years before sanctions were imposed on Russia. As we previously noted, the S-70 downed over Ukrainian territory appears to be one of the earlier examples, which first emerged in early 2019, or one built to a similar specification and is significantly lower in sophistication than a more refined variant with enhanced low-observable (stealth) features rolled out in 2021. After the S-70 was discovered, we pointed out that its wreckage 'may represent the most enticing foreign material exploitation (FME) opportunity of the conflict, and there have been many of them so far.' While not a find of any new technology, today’s announcement by GUR about the components highlights the importance of such efforts.

(Photo by Pierre Crom/Getty Images) Pierre Crom We reached out to the companies highlighted by GUR for their responses. 'ST is an integrated device manufacturer,' company spokesman Ronan Mulvaney told us in an email Friday. 'We work with more than 200,000 customers and thousands of partners around the world. We do not authorize nor condone the use of our products outside of their intended purpose.' The company, Mulvaney added, has a 'comprehensive global trade compliance program through which we comply with all international trade rules and regulations. We have an internal export control compliance program that contains training and procedures to assure compliance with various export controls regulations. As part of that program, we provide guidelines to our sales channels to assure each party in our supply chain understands its responsibility to comply with applicable laws and regulations. We also collaborate and exchange information with third parties undertaking field research efforts as well as various government and non-government organizations.' Since the start of Russia's all-out war, ST has 'taken actions to comply with the specific requirements of multiple sanction packages and export control measures implemented by the European Union, the United States, and partnering countries against Russia and Belarus,' Mulvaney explained. 'These actions include reinforcing the compliance requirements for all our sales channels - including vigilance against sanction evasion and shipping diversion, implementing additional end user screening measures, deploying automated solutions for customers and product checks, and enhancing our awareness communication to targeted stakeholders.' Furthermore, ST no longer has operations in Russia, Mulvaney stated. ST microprocessor. (GUR) Inferion has also taken steps to stop the flow of its components to Russia, the company told us. 'Compliance with applicable laws is of paramount importance for Infineon, and we have established robust policies and processes to comply with these laws,' company spokesman Andre Tauber told The War Zone in an email. A huge challenge, he said, is controlling sales 'throughout the entire lifetime of a product (Infineon produces around 30 billion chips per year). Still, we have taken extensive measures at our disposal to ensure compliance with sanctions aiming to not only comply with the letter but also with the spirit of the sanctions.' Infineon, Tauber added, 'has taken extensive measures to stop all direct and indirect shipments to Russia immediately after the Russian attack on Ukraine regardless of the legal possibility to continue certain transactions. As decided in March 2022, Infineon subsequently liquidated its entity in Russia.' The company has 'instructed all distribution partners globally to implement robust measures that will prevent any diversion of Infineon products or services contrary to the sanctions. Infineon has reiterated and specified this clear position several times in communications to its distribution partners.' In addition, Inferion is using 'various data sources to oversee compliance with existing regulations. In case we get tangible evidence that companies with which we have a business relationship are doing trade with Russia, we terminate the delivery and demand clarification from the company in question.' Infineon transistor (GUR) This is not by any means the first time components from some of these companies have been found on Russian weapons. Far from it in fact. A number were in weapons listed in database GUR provided to us in 2022. Back then, Inferion told us it had 'not found any evidence of military use of our products in Russia.' While other companies mentioned have yet to return messages today, Analog Devices responded in 2022. The company which eventually bought Maxim Integrated, told us it at the time that it was 'committed to full compliance with U.S, EU and other countries’ laws including export controls, trade sanctions and regulations,' said Ferda Millan, a company spokeswoman. Iranian and North Korean weapons used by Russia and recovered by Ukraine also contain large amounts of Western components. For example, in 2022 we reported that a number of electronic components powering the Iranian-made Mohajer-6 drones used by Russian forces in Ukraine were produced in the United States and other allied nations. Ukraine discovered that an Iranian-made Mojahar-6 drone used by Russia contained a number of foreign components. (Iranian State News) Perhaps even more alarming, a short-range ballistic missile (SRBM) produced by North Korea used against Ukraine by Russia earlier this year relied on more than 290 foreign-sourced components, many of them originating from U.S. manufacturers, according to a study by Conflict Armament Research (CAR), a U.K.-based investigative organization. The North Korean KN-23 short-range ballistic missile seen here may be among the types containing nearly 300 foreign-made components.( North Korean State Media) The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) acknowledges the challenge. 'The sheer global ubiquity of semiconductors underscores the challenge we face. According to World Semiconductor Trade Statistics, the semiconductor industry shipped over 3 trillion chips globally between 2021 and 2023,' SIA said in a recent blog. 'These volumes will only increase as global demand for semiconductors continues to boom, with global sales projected to reach $1 trillion by 2030. Trillions more chips – many of which were sold and shipped years before Russia invaded Ukraine – remain in circulation, often stockpiled in warehouses. Mature node, or so-called 'legacy' chips, have a shelf life that can last decades. So, it is unsurprising some chips recovered from Russian weapons in Ukraine were manufactured well before the beginning of the conflict, and in some cases by companies that no longer exist.' Russia 'also has decades of experience evading export controls and sanctions, building a system of transshipment routes, cultivating networks of diverters in third countries, and employing sophisticated deception tactics,' SIA noted. 'Malign actors go to great lengths to circumvent government restrictions and established company compliance actions, evading even the most sophisticated screening and due diligence efforts.' While it is exceedingly difficult for governments and companies to police the flow of these vital components, GUR offered a list of suggestions on how to improve the fight to stop it. Governments should 'approve the list of goods subject to enhanced export control ban their re-export to Russia, Belarus, Iran, and the DPRK and 'standardize enhanced inspection procedures during their deliveries to risky jurisdictions increase liability for violations and negligence.' In addition, banks should be 'involved in inspections and share information and synchronize efforts with other countries.' Meanwhile, manufacturers and distributors should 'form a list of products whose deliveries require enhanced inspections approve and regularly update inspection procedures taking into account recommendations, red-flags, sanctions circumvention schemes disseminate new inspection policies among counterparties.' They should also add a condition for their compliance to contracts, respond to detection of products in Russian weapons, investigate supply chain and get involved parties and governments to take measures to stop supplies, GUR argued. The companies who responded to our queries said they were taking such steps. However, given the vast number of components, companies, countries and profits involved, coordination and cooperation may be impossible to achieve on a grand scale. The fact that chips of all types get dumped into China's vast recycling ecosystem also makes stopping them falling into unwanted hands all but impossible. As a result, the S-70 Hunter-B won't be the last Russian weapon found to be packed Western-made components. Update: 4:15 PM Eastern - Analog Devices Inc. and Texas Instruments responded to our questions. Analog Devices Inc. (ADI) 'is committed to preventing the unauthorized resale, illicit diversion, and misuse of our products, and to complying with applicable laws and regulations in the countries where we operate,' company official Ferda Millan told us. 'We at ADI strongly condemn the illicit diversion and unintended misuse of our products.' Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and in compliance with U.S. and EU sanctions, 'ADI ceased business activities in Russia and the Russian-backed regions of Ukraine and Belarus, and promptly instructed all of our distributors to halt shipments of our products into these regions,' Millan added. 'Combating the unauthorized resale, diversion, and misuse of products and technologies is a challenge the entire semiconductor industry faces and one that ADI takes very seriously.' In addition 'ADI is dedicated to upholding high standards of compliance and transparency,' Millan explained. 'We continue to look for ways to identify and prevent third-party attempts to engage in unauthorized resale, diversion, or misuse of our products and technology.' The company 'firmly believes that preventing illicit diversion requires a unified effort and vigilant approach,' Millan continued. 'ADI supports and is cooperating with efforts by the U.S. Congress, federal government agencies, law enforcement, and non-governmental organizations to investigate improper diversion of semiconductor parts and take appropriate action to stop it. ' Analog isolator. (GUR) Texas Instruments (TI) 'strongly opposes the use of our chips in Russian military equipment and the illicit diversion of our products to Russia,' the company told The War Zone. 'TI stopped selling products into Russia and Belarus in February 2022. Any shipments of TI chips into Russia are illicit and unauthorized.' The company devotes 'significant time and resources to developing, implementing and refining policies and procedures to combat illicit diversion and keep chips out of the hands of bad actors,' TI added. 'Our dedicated global trade compliance team carefully monitors the sale and shipment of our products, including screening customers and orders multiple times throughout the ordering process. We regularly identify and block suspicious and fraudulent orders.' TI said it is company policy to 'comply with export control laws. We require our distributors and customers to comply with export control laws and prohibit them from reselling chips into Russia. If there is evidence indicating diversion, we investigate and take action.' 'We are committed to continually evolving and improving our efforts working collaboratively with law enforcement, government agencies, non-governmental organizations and industry partners.'

China’s Stealth CH-7 Long-Endurance Drone Emerges	The first example of China’s mysterious CH-7 stealthy flying-wing drone seems to have been revealed, although with a somewhat different look to it compared with previous mockups, and a very impressive size. This points to China’s accelerated efforts to develop low-observable, long-endurance drones and while this one appears to be tailored for intelligence, reconnaissance, and surveillance (ISR), there have long been claims that it also will undertake strike missions, as an uncrewed combat aerial vehicle (UCAV). Better resolution&#8230; absolutely Huge #ZhuhaiAirShow2024 CH-7 pic.twitter.com/dAhh8hVr3h&mdash; Húrin (@Hurin92) November 8, 2024 A video and stills released by Chinese state media today show the drone on a so-far unidentified runway and taxiing down it, day and night, although we don’t see it in the air. The yellow-colored coat of primer is frequently seen on Chinese aircraft during their test phase. Meanwhile, a pair of apparent air data probes on the lading edges of the wing point to this being a prototype or perhaps a pre-production machine. The apparent CH-7 prototype on the runway. via Chinese Internet At this point, it should be stressed that we don’t know for sure that this is the CH-7, but it certainly seems like the best fit and has been identified as such by various Chinese aerospace observers. There is also a possibility that we are seeing computer-generated images, or at least computer-enhanced ones, but there is nothing that would point conclusively to this being the case at this time. Developed by the state-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), specifically by its 11th Research Institute, the CH-7 (or Caihong-7, meaning Rainbow-7) is a high-altitude UCAV that is widely understood to be optimized for penetrating deep into hostile airspace. It would achieve this through a combination of low-observable (stealth) design and flying at very high altitudes, operating for extended periods of time without ever being detected. A close-up view of the apparent CH-7 prototype on the runway. via Chinese Internet The CH-7 has also gone through several different iterations since it was first revealed, with the design being progressively adapted. The drone was first unveiled in the form of a full-scale mockup at Airshow China 2018 in Zhuhai. At this point, it looked very much like a Chinese clone of the Northrop Grumman X-47B UCAV, with the same modified ‘cranked kite’ wing, although it featured canted wingtips instead of the triangular wingtip edges found on the U.S. aircraft. Visitors take pictures of the mockup of the CH-7 at Airshow China 2018 in Zhuhai, in the Guangdong province of southern China, on November 6, 2018.

WANG ZHAO/AFP via Getty Images Liang Xu By the time the CH-7 appeared again in model from at Zhuhai, for Airshow China 2022, it now had redesigned wing flaps, sharper canted wingtips, and a longer central engine nacelle hump. In the process, the dimensions of the drone also changed. In its 2018 form, published figures included a wingspan of 22 meters (72 feet), while the 2022 model represented a drone with a wingspan of 26 meters (85 feet). Other published specifications, which remain provisional, include a length of 10 meters (33 feet), a maximum takeoff weight of 10,000 kilograms (22,000 pounds), a maximum speed of 926 km/h (575 mph), and an endurance of up to 15 hours. These all apply to the 2022 version of the drone. The revised mockup of the CH-7 at Airshow China 2022 on November 6, 2022. Photo by VCG/VCG via Getty Images YANG SHUGUANG Otherwise, key features of the CH-7 include a dorsally mounted intake for a so-far unidentified turbofan engine, and an internal payload bay, for weapons and sensors. In the latest video the drone’s wing appears less sharply swept than on the 2022 model. It also seems that the drone has grown in size, at least based on a rough comparison of the landing gear and the engine exhaust aperture with those on the mock-ups. Notable features when looking at the rear aspect of the drone in its latest version include prominent gaps inboard of the trailing-edge flaps, where the wing meets the blended body section. The is likely a temporary configuration and a gap-filler would fill this section. A slot-like low-observable platypus engine exhaust, with the nozzle fully concealed from most angles of view is also visible. Engine exhausts are among the most notoriously complicated elements of developing any stealth aircraft, crewed or uncrewed, something that we have seen played out in the development of the Russian S-70 Okhotnik-B, or Hunter-B, UCAV, another flying wing design with clear stealth aspirations. Interestingly, the CH-7 in its latest form bears a striking resemblance to at least some unofficial artwork of the U.S. Air Force’s secretive so-called RQ-180, a high-altitude, long-endurance stealth drone that you can read more about here. While we know very little about the RQ-180 — even its designation is unconfirmed — it’s almost certainly a large, flying-wing aircraft with slender wings and an overall design based around very low-observable (stealth) requirements. Just Fancy That pic.twitter.com/f9EWmP3y0x&mdash; Bill Sweetman (@ValkStrategy) November 8, 2024 Back in 2018, a corporate video from CASC said that the CH-7 was due to begin flight tests in 2019, with production to commence by 2022 although it’s unclear is either of these targets was met. On the other hand, it could also be the case that the imagery released today dates back several years. Earlier this year, Chinese state-owned media reported that the CH-7 had completed testing and was scheduled to complete development in 2024. This would suggest that it had also completed the flight-test program, something we’re yet to see evidence of. China has meanwhile been busy with a growing portfolio of stealthy drones, developing new ones as well as refining the low-observable characteristics of existing platforms like the GJ-11 Sharp Sword, testing of which continues apace. But the CH-7 program is of particular interest since it is concerned with a UCAV that’s apparently designed to penetrate deep into hostile airspace at high altitudes. According to official statements, it should also be able to strike strategic targets, as well as bring back critical intelligence. The GJ-11 in its revised, more stealthy form, while on parade in October 2019. China Military When it was unveiled, the CH-7 was described as a high-altitude, long-endurance stealth combat drone, its chief designer Shi Wen saying that the aircraft would be able to 'fly long hours, scout, and strike the target when necessary.' However, in its current iteration, the ISR mission appears to be the primary one. This is backed up by the high-altitude specification, which would make the drone ideal for peering into very high defended areas — and also strike targets of opportunity if configured to do so. A production version of the CH-7 would also appear to have particular relevance in a naval context, as it could range far out over the Pacific, keeping tabs on enemy ships and providing targeting data for ground-based long-range missiles, for example, as well as missile-toting warships and bombers. An inert air-launched antis-hip ballistic missile missiles under the wing of a Chinese H-6K bomber. via Chinese internet Once again, this underscores the fact that China has embraced the concept of very stealthy uncrewed aircraft for independent strike missions, a category of platform that is, as far as we know, absent from the U.S. military. You can read all about the implications of this reality in this special feature of ours. While the CH-7 will very likely find a place within the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) order of battle, it’s also very noteworthy that the design — like the rest of the diverse Caihong series — has also been pitched for export. It isn't clear if this enlarged variant would still be up for international sale, but if it is, it would offer a capability nobody else is selling on the advanced arms market. In the past, and despite questions being raised about the quality of certain Chinese drone exports, Beijing has firmly established itself as a major global purveyor of uncrewed air vehicles, including armed ones. Another view of the original CH-7 mockup at Zhuhai in 2018. via Chinese Internet China’s ambitious positioning — and its undoubted commercial success — in this regard is all the more significant when we consider the export restrictions placed on this kind of technology by the United States. In particular, the Missile Technology Control Regime limits the exports of missiles and other uncrewed vehicles, meaning that armed versions of the MQ-9 Reaper family, for example, are only sold to the closest U.S. allies. The United States, and other Western nations, are not currently able to offer for export a stealthy UCAV like the CH-7, even if the political conditions were met. For China, this is not a problem, although we don’t know exactly how long it will take to complete development of the CH-7, much less get it into the hands of a potential customer. On the other hand, the CH-7 is a drone that’s an entirely different scale to those China has exported before, with much more advanced capabilities, which might also limit such opportunities and China may keep its sensitive capabilities to itself. It is also possible a less capable and possibly smaller variant could be offered for export. Whatever the status of the CH-7 program at this point, it remains highly intriguing, with the potential to provide China with a class of multi-role drone that may well not have any other direct competitor. Above all else imagery of the drone provides yet more evidence of the China’s rapid pace of development when it comes to stealthy unmanned aircraft as well as drones of all types.
