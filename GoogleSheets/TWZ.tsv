ARRW Hypersonic Missile Program Gets New Funding Despite Signs Of...	Lockheed Martin has received more than $13 million in additional funds for the AGM-183A Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW) hypersonic missile program. The deal could be part of work to wind down the effort, but is also the latest in a string of developments that have raised questions about its current status. The War Zone has already explored signs pointing to a potential follow-on to ARRW, possibly tied in with work on a related program called Tactical Boost Glide (TBG), which may already be occurring in the classified realm. On September 26, the U.S. Air Force awarded Lockheed Martin's Missile and Fire Control division a new modification, valued at $13,447,746, to an existing ARRW contact. The contract's cumulative value increased to $1,319,270,400 as a result. The news came in the Pentagon's daily contracting notice. A low-quality image of an ARRW after launch during a previous live-fire flight test. USAF 'Work will be performed in Orlando, Florida, and is expected to be completed by Aug. 31, 2025,' the Pentagon's notice added. 'Fiscal 2023 research, development, test, and evaluation funds in the amount of $13,447,746 are being obligated at the time of award.' No further details about the work to be performed were included. The War Zone reached out to Lockheed Martin for more information and was directed to contact the Air Force. We have since reached out to the Air Force for more information about this contract and ARRW's current status, but have not yet received a response. The Air Force did not request any additional funds for ARRW in its most recent budget request for the 2025 Fiscal Year, which the service rolled out earlier this year. The air-launched ARRW is what is known as a hypersonic boost-glide vehicle weapon. The missile uses a rocket booster to propel an unpowered hypersonic glide vehicle to an optimal speed and altitude and then releases it to glide down along a largely atmospheric flight path to its target. The vehicle travels at hypersonic speed, defined as anything about Mach 5, and is also designed to be able to make erratic movements along the way. The combination of speed and maneuverability makes weapons of this kind difficult to detect in enough time to act, let alone intercept, presenting major complications for defenders. A graphic showing, in a very rudimentary way, the difference in trajectories between hypersonic boost-glide vehicles, traditional ballistic missiles, quasi or aeroballistic missiles, and air-breathing hypersonic cruise missiles. GAO For a time, the AGM-183A looked set to become the Air Force's first operational hypersonic weapon. However, last year, the service had indicated it was looking to close out work on ARRW and to shift focus to air-breathing hypersonic cruise missiles, which function in a completely different manner from hypersonic boost-glide vehicle weapons. The ARRW program had a mixed testing record, at least from what is known publicly. As noted, it is very possible that the new ARRW funding Lockheed Martin received last month is part of the work now to shut things down. 'ARRW will complete contract closeout, finalize documentation and analysis, and activities to support the leave behind capability,' the Air Force said in its 2025 Fiscal Year budget request. 'Testing will enable ARRW to collect valuable data, build capacity and capability, allow hypersonics programs to leverage and build upon each other, and project the overall technology forward.' In line with this, the Air Force continued with its previously planned flight testing schedule for ARRW even after announcing its intention to pull the plug on the program last year. This culminated with a final end-to-end test, at least that we know of, over the Western Pacific in March of this year. That launch also provided an opportunity for a significant demonstration of capability and show of force aimed particularly at the Chinese government, as The War Zone highlighted at the time and that you read more about here. A live AGM-183A ARRW under the wing of a B-52 bomber at Andersen Air Force Base on Guam ahead of a test over the Western Pacific earlier this year. USAF At the same time, it continues to be unclear whether or not the Air Force is truly through with ARRW and/or whether a direct follow-on program may already be in progress. 'When we're in the classified session, I can go into a little bit of detail about the differences between those two capabilities, specifically, and then we'll highlight again what characteristics you need based on the mission set,' Air Force Lt. Gen. Dale White, the Military Deputy at the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics told members of the House Armed Services Committee at a hearing in March. White was responding directly to a question about whether his service was more committed to hypersonic cruise missiles than hypersonic boost-glide vehicle designs. 'Let’s just say that there is a plan,' William LaPlante, the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, the Pentagon's top weapons buyer, had told members of Congress at another hearing back in February. 'It’s not something we can talk about in this open [unclassified] session. But we’d like to talk [in a classified setting].' Similar uncertainty continues to surround TBG, a separate, but related program that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and Air Force run jointly that also involves work on an unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicle design. A least one TBG flight test is understood to have occurred, but where or when that was conducted has not been confirmed. A rendering of DARPA’s Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 (HTV-2) being released. HTV-2 was among several previous hypersonic developments that DARPA said fed into the Tactical Boost Glide (TBG) program. DARPA A rendering of DARPA's Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 (HTV-2) being released. HTV-2 was among the previous hypersonic developments that DARPA said fed into the Tactical Boost Glide (TBG) program. DARPA When asked by The War Zone about TBG testing to date back in April, a DARPA spokesperson declined to confirm or deny any tests had occurred or provide any details about their outcomes. They also said they could not provide more information about the program beyond what is on the agency's website. 'The Tactical Boost Glide (TBG) program is a joint DARPA/U.S. Air Force (USAF) effort that aims to develop and demonstrate technologies to enable future air-launched, tactical-range hypersonic boost glide systems,' according to the TBG program description on DARPA's website at the time of writing. 'TBG is a two-phase effort that plans to include ground and flight testing to mature critical technologies, and aims to demonstrate the system performance achievable through the integration of those technologies. The program is using a disciplined systems engineering approach to define demonstration system objectives and identify enabling technologies needed for future systems.' TBG was originally presented as a lead-in to ARRW, but the programs ultimately ended up being conducted in parallel. Lockheed Martin, the prime contractor on both programs, has said in the past that ARRW had ultimately pulled ahead in terms of design maturity. The Air Force has also said previously that work done under TBG was incorporated into the development of ARRW. DARPA had been exploring the potential for turning the TBG system into a sea-launched weapon and there are plans to transition elements of the program to the U.S. Navy in the future, as well. The Navy is pursuing a separate hypersonic boost-glide vehicle weapon with the U.S. Army, which is set to be integrated onto Zumwalt class stealth destroyers and Block IV Virginia class submarines, as well as fired from ground-based launchers. That missile has experienced its own testing troubles. Separate questions have emerged previously about the Air Force's plans for its air-breathing Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile (HACM) program. 'It is early days in the program, and so you certainly hope that a program like HACM is on track at this stage, because it’s quite early. And they typically are, right? And so, I’d say it’s on track but it is a challenging program,' Andrew Hunter, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, told DefenseScoop in an interview published in December 2023. 'That’s why we’re undertaking a rapid prototyping effort really is to work through some of the potential risks, some of the potential technical risks associated with the HACM concept.' A rendering Raytheon has previously released in relation to the HACM program. Raytheon The Air Force, in partnership with the Australian armed forces, is still very publicly moving ahead with HACM. The first test of that missile, which Raytheon is leading the development of, could come as early as this month. Last week, Raytheon also received a new $73 million contract to help lay the groundwork for the production of those weapons. The hope is that HACM will reach at least a limited operational capability in 2027. Whatever the future might hold now for ARRW, some type of work at least on that program is funded now well into next year.

Bolt-M Aims To Make Kamikaze Drone Attacks More User Friendly, Ef...	Newcomer defense contractor Anduril has revealed its Bolt-M, an machine-learning infused strike drone, a quadcopter-type design that’s easily transportable and aims to put lethal precision firepower in the hands of individual soldiers. Bolt-M is already being lined up for testing by the U.S. Marine Corps, as that service looks to harness the capabilities of kamikaze drones, while its autonomous features point the way to a new generation of loitering munitions that are easier to use and more reliable than those currently fielded. The promise and dangers of AI-enabled lower-end aerial drones on the battlefield is something that TWZ has explored in depth in the past. Anduril is now looking to secure its position in this fast-changing field. Announced yesterday, the Bolt-M is part of a wider family of autonomous air vehicles that are man-portable and use the same basic vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) quadcopter platform. While the baseline Bolt is intended for surveillance and search and rescue, the Bolt-M (for munition) is more intriguing, building on the success and proliferation of smaller strike drones that have been used to great effect in Ukraine and elsewhere. Unlike the low-end kamikaze drones that are proliferating in Ukraine, which are primarily improvized first-person view (FPV) types, the Bolt-M uses machine learning and automation from the outset to make it easier to employ. Onboard software is used to 'automate the flight behaviors required to accurately track and strike a target, while providing human operators with four simple decisions: where to look, what to follow, how to engage, and when to strike,' the company explains in a press release. While the pilot of an FPV drone requires extensive training to successfully find and strike targets, the Bolt-M aims to provide soldiers with a much simpler way of achieving similar effects. The Bolt-M employs the now-familiar quadcopter configuration widely used in smaller drones. Anduril/YouTube screencap At the heart of Bolt-M is Anduril’s Lattice software platform that leverages AI and machine learning technologies. This automates the flight behaviors required to navigate to, find, track, and strike dynamic targets. While the drone features semi-autonomous waypoint navigation, the operator can also modify the flightpath using a touchscreen interface, although more basic navigation decisions are still made by the Lattice software, allowing the user to concentrate on other tasks. The operator can also select the distance from the target at which the drone should loiter, and the type of engagement profile to execute, depending on the target type and battlefield conditions. The drone’s object tracking capability means that the operator can draw a bounding box around any visually-acquired target using the drone's dual electro-optical and infrared camera. Bolt-M will then follow that target autonomously, but if a new threat emerges, the soldier can select it instead, meaning that time-sensitive and pop-up threats can be prosecuted. Bolt-M can also be used multiple times for reconnaissance in this manner. A target is selected on the Bolt-M ground control station (GCS). Anduril/YouTube screencap Automated target tracking of this kind is already making its way to the battlefield in Ukraine, albeit in a more rudimentary form. Being able to lock on to a target and complete the attack even if a communications link is degraded or lost entirely is extremely beneficial. First, it overcomes major issues with line-of-sight connectivity as the drone dives low to the ground to hit its target, where the feed to its controller degrades due topography and structures. It also makes the drone far less vulnerable to short-range electronic warfare systems, especially those mounted on vehicles themselves. The drone can continue its terminal attack run even if its communications link is totally disrupted via electroinc attack during the terminal phase of its attack run. There are other precedents for this kind of technology, notably the AeroVironment Switchblade, a series of miniature loitering munitions that have been in production for well over a decade and used extensively in Ukraine. These also offer a limited degree of autonomous attack capability, since, like the Bolt-M, the drone can fly itself to its target once it is designated by a human. In the Switchblade, this feature serves, above all, to improve the probability of a kill, especially when striking moving targets, but it is more austere than the suite of technology Anduril is brining forward with its Bolt-M.

Julian Alvarado, prepares to launch a Switchblade unmanned aircraft system during Littoral Exercise II (LEX II) on Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, March 3, 2022. U.S. Marine Corps photo by Lance Cpl. Ryan Ramsammy More complex engagements can be carried out by the Bolt-M, too. For example, once a target is identified in Lattice, the soldier can select a standoff position for the drone. Bolt-M will remain there, typically out of visual or acoustic detection range, keeping track of the target and then striking it once instructed by the operator to do so. The soldier operating the drone can also optimize that terminal attack, selecting the most effective engagement angle and warhead fuzing, for example. Throughout, the operator can intervene in the engagement process, ensuring that the drone retains a human-in-the-loop, at least till the attack order is finalized, in line with U.S. Department of Defense protocol for lethal autonomous weapons. A screencap from a promotional video shows the detonation of a Bolt-M above a utility vehicle. Anduril/YouTube screencap It's worth noting that profusion of videos showing the successful employment of FPV drones in Ukraine — sometimes achieving accuracy that is hard to believe — belies the fact that many of these drones fail to hit their target. The need to make this class of weapon more reliable and resilient is pressing, although it remains a factor that will be balanced against cost and quality.

In this way, information gathered by Bolt-series drones can be shared with third-party platforms and commanders. Operating on a common software platform and across a common network, it's also possible that Bolt-M could be rapidly adapted to make cooperative 'swarming' attacks with a high degree of autonomy, although such a function hasn't been disclosed yet. In terms of performance, the Bolt-M drone has more than 40 minutes of endurance and a range of around 12 miles. The types of warheads include anti-personnel and anti-materiel, each of which can weigh up to three pounds. Different munition payloads can be carried, including some developed in collaboration with Kraken Kinetics, and others from Anduril. Typical targets include static or moving ground-based targets, including light vehicles, dismounted personnel, trenches, and more, Anduril says. The Bolt-M is provided with a mountable ground control station (GCS), and it’s designed for user safety, including an electronic safe and arm device (ESAD), meaning it can be transported across the battlefield without risk of detonation, and can be unpacked and launched in only five minutes. The same GCS can also be used for training and simulation, using the handheld interface. The safety interface for the Bolt-M as seen in a company video. Anduril/YouTube screencap Clearly, Bolt-M is inspired by the effectiveness of FPV drones in Ukraine and in other combat theaters but expands on the advantages of these kinds of lightweight, man-portable loitering munitions. By introducing a refined user interface powered by very capable and rapidly adaptable software, it should be far more reliable, easier to operate, and effective than an improvised FPV drone. That being said, cost remains a glaring unknown. While added features are great to have and better effectiveness on the battlefield is always a good thing, brining the price down to a point where Bolt-M can be bought in very large numbers could be critical to its success. This is also a field that is rapidly growing in terms of competition and is bound to get very price competitive in the near future. So far, we don't know the exact developmental status of Bolt-M, however, Anduril has confirmed that the U.S. Marine Corps will start testing it over the next six months, as part of 'a pretty rigorous test and evaluation campaign,' according to Anduril Chief Strategy Officer Chris Brose. This compressed timeline suggests that Bolt-M may well be informed by the company having tested similar capabilities already in Ukraine, as has been suggested. In April this year, Anduril was one of three companies (the others being Teledyne FLIR Defense and AeroVironment) that received a U.S. Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) contract under its Organic Precision Fires-Light (OPF-L) program. While OPF-L doesn’t specifically call for autonomous operations, it is looking for easy-to-use, explosives-laden, man-portable loitering munitions, as well as launchers for these weapons on ground vehicles and uncrewed surface vessels. Regardless, the appearance of Bolt-M is another very clear indicator that highly automated, feature rich, production class lower-end strike drones are fast becoming a reality.

North Korea Wading Deeper Into Russia’s War Against Ukraine	North Korea appears to be getting more deeply involved in the Ukraine war, going beyond supplying Russia with munitions. Its military engineers 'have been deployed to help Russia target Ukraine with ballistic missiles' it provided to Russia, The Guardian reported, citing senior officials in Kyiv and Seoul. Dozens of North Koreans are behind Russian lines, 'in teams that support launcher systems for KN-23 [short-range ballistic] missiles,' a source in Ukraine told the publication. As we reported earlier this year, North Korea began supplying Russia with those missiles, also known as Hwasong-11s, but about half were defective, according to an analysis from Ukrainian state prosecutors. North Koreans deployed alongside Russian troops in Ukraine, sources say Guardian Australia (@GuardianAus) October 10, 2024 South Korea’s Defense Minister, Kim Yong-hyun, told members of parliament in Seoul this week that it was 'highly likely' that North Korean officers had been deployed to fight alongside Russians, and as we previously reported, several had died last week in an attack on a Russian base in the Donetsk region. He did not give further details. The head of Ukraine’s Center for Countering Disinformation, Andriy Kovalenko, concurred. In a post on Telegram, he said that some North Koreans had been killed in Ukraine. His organization is part of the National Security and Defense Council. All this comes in the wake of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un's visit to Russia for a summit with President Vladimir Putin where the two men bolstered their deepening ties with a secret arms deal. It was reported that, among other things, it called for Pyongyang to send construction and engineering forces to Russia-occupied territories of Ukraine for rebuilding work. There was no indication of how many personnel would be involved or the exact nature of their work. The increasing evidence of North Korean troops in Ukraine marks a big escalation. Foreigners have fought as mercenaries for Russia, 'but if North Koreans are on the ground it would mark the first time a foreign government has sent troops in uniform to support Moscow’s war,' the Guardian noted 'North Korea is likely to deploy members of its regular armed forces to Ukraine in support of Russia, South Korea's defense chief said Tuesday, in the latest sign of deepening military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow&#8230;'As Russia and North Korea have signed a mutual… pic.twitter.com/1HBKWjfE3t&mdash; Rob Lee (@RALee85) October 9, 2024 Aside from helping Russia, North Korea benefits from this relationship by testing its weaponry and giving its troops live combat experience. 'For North Korea, which has supplied Russia with many shells and missiles, it’s crucial to learn how to handle different weapons and gain real-world combat experience,' Lim Eul-chul, a professor at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies in Seoul, the Guardian reported. 'This might even be a driving factor behind sending North Korean soldiers – to provide them with diverse experiences and wartime training.' In addition to troops, Pyongyang has given Moscow about three million artillery shells a year, about half of what Russian forces are using in Ukraine, according to Western intelligence, The Times of London reported. 'Although many of the shells are believed to be faulty, the sheer quantity has allowed Russia to make steady gains, most recently capturing the eastern Ukrainian city of Vuhledar. Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, head of the Ukrainian Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR), warned in September that shipments of North Korean shells were tilting the war in Russia’s favor. 'Our biggest problem from all these allies of Russia is from North Korea. Because with the volume of military products that they supply, they actually affect the intensity of the fighting,' he said. About half of the artillery shells used by Russia, about 3 million annually, come from North Korea, according to The Times. pic.twitter.com/c2ySBCPSCg&mdash; MilitaryNewsUA (@front_ukrainian) October 5, 2024 In addition to killing the North Korean officers, Ukraine has also attacked Russian facilities storing North Korean arms. On Wednesday the Ukrainian military said it destroyed North Korean ammunition in a strike on a depot in the town of Karachev, in Russia's Bryansk region, 60 miles from the Ukrainian border, Kovalenko said on Telegram. The warehouse belonged to the 67th arsenal of the Main Missile and Artillery Directorate of the Russian Defense Ministry.

However it appears to be clearly escalating its role. The Latest On the battlefield, Ukraine is 'mounting a strong defense' against Russia, with Russia’s Kursk region and Donetsk in eastern Ukraine seeing the heaviest fighting, a senior U.S. military official told reporters, including from The War Zone, on Wednesday. 'Up in Kursk, there have been some limited counterattacks by the Russians, but really there are no meaningful gains or exchanges of territory in the last several weeks, and then down in Donetsk, while the Russians did make some advances earlier in the summer, those advances have slowed compared to that time period.' Since February 2022, Ukraine 'has inflicted more than 600,000 casualties on Russian forces,' a senior U.S. defense official said at the same press briefing. 'In September of this year, Russia, Russian forces sustained more casualties in terms of both killed and wounded in action than in any other month of the war.' The bulk of the Russian casualties last month came during attacks on Pokrovsk and Vuhledar in Donetsk, the senior military official said, adding that Ukraine is taking a 'defense in depth' approach, trading territory for time with an eye toward a new offensive next year. 'My assessment is that the Ukrainians will be able to maintain their position and Kursk for some amount of time here into the future, I think several months and potentially beyond,' tne senior military official posited. There was little territory exchanged over the past few days according to the latest assessment from the Insitute for the Study of War (ISW). Kursk: Ukrainian and Russian forces 'continued assaults in Glushkovsky Raion west of the main Ukrainian salient in Kursk Oblast on October 7, 8, and 9 but did not make any confirmed advances,' ISW reported. Kharkiv: Russian forces recently advanced within Vovchansk amid continued offensive operations in northern Kharkiv Oblast on October 7, 8, and 9. 'Geolocated footage published on October 7 showing a Russian soldier raising a Russian flag in a building at the Vovchansk Aggregate Plant indicates that Russian forces likely recaptured the plant.' Luhansk: Russian forces recently advanced northwest of Kreminna amid continued offensive operations along the Kupyansk-Svatove-Kreminna line on October 8 and 9. Donetsk: Russian forces recently advanced near Siversk, southern Toretsk, southwest of Donetsk City and southeast of Pokrosk amid continued Russian offensive operations. Russian forces continued offensive operations near Chasiv Yar on October 7, 8, and 9, but there were no confirmed changes to the frontline in this area. Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces recently advanced during a counterattack east of Pokrovsk. Zaporizhzhia: Russian forces 'recently marginally advanced south of Stepnohirsk amid continued assaults in western Zaporizhia Oblast on October 7, 8, and 9,' ISW reported. 'Geolocated footage published on October 8 indicates that Russian forces recently marginally advanced in southwestern Kamyanske (south of Stepnohirsk).' Kherson: Russian forces continued assaults in the Kherson direction on October 7, 8, and 9, but there were no confirmed changes to the frontline in this direction.

Widely used mostly by gamers, Discord has become increasingly important for the military, particularly drone operators. The ban, announced by the internet regulator Roskomnadzor on Tuesday, 'highlights a glaring technology lapse within the Russian military,' The Washington Post reported 'More than 2½ years into the war, it has failed to implement a secure, dependable Russian-made communications system, instead relying on privately owned platforms such as Discord and Telegram.' The ban has also renewed a wider debate about how Russia’s bureaucratic machine keeps frustrating the military effort. 'A replacement should have been created and commanders should have been alerted to the plans so that the work at the front would simply not be broken in an instant,' one blogger wrote. 'It’s called seeing a little further than your nose.' You can see the value of Discord for Russian drone operators in the video below. Video reportedly from a Russian command post in Bakhmut.

Secretive X-37B Spaceplane To Use Aerobraking Maneuvers To Rapidl...	One of America's secretive X-37Bs is set to perform a series of aerobraking maneuvers that will significantly change its orbit, which is said to be a first-of-its-kind event for the mini-space shuttle. This is part of the seventh known X-37B mission, which began last December, and has already involved the reusable spaceplane operating in a much higher orbit than ever before. The U.S. Space Force, to which the two X-37Bs are now assigned, announced the planned orbital maneuvers as part of the current Orbital Test Vehicle 7 (OTV-7) mission earlier today. The X-37B that is now in space was launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on December 28, 2023. A SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket carrying one of two X-37B reusable spaceplanes blasts off from the Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39A on December 28, 2023. USSF Through the 'series of novel maneuvers, called aerobraking' the X-37B will 'change its orbit around Earth and safely dispose of its service module components in accordance with recognized standards for space debris mitigation,' according to the Space Force release. 'The use of the aerobraking maneuver – a series of passes using the drag of Earth's atmosphere – enables the spacecraft to change orbits while expending minimal fuel.' It isn't clear if the X-37B has already dropped to a lower orbit ahead of the aerobraking. As noted, the mini-shuttle will have to pass relatively close to the Earth to drag in the atmosphere to execute the maneuver at all. The use of aerobraking in space flight is not new and has been employed by NASA and other space agencies globally to change the orbits of other spacecraft for decades now. In its release today, Space Force also explicitly cited 'decades of general lessons learned from the scientific community conducting Moon and Mars missions,' along with experience gained during the previous six X-37B missions, as having contributed to the planning around these new maneuvers. 'Once the aerobrake maneuver is complete, the X-378 [sic; X-37B] will resume its test and experimentation objectives until they are accomplished, at which time the vehicle will de-orbit and execute a safe return as it has during its six previous missions,' the release adds. 'Since December 28, 2023, the United States Space Force, supported by the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office, has conducted radiation effect experiments and has been testing Space Domain Awareness technologies in a Highly Elliptical Orbit.' A picture of an X-37B after completing a previous mission. USAF 'This novel and efficient series of maneuvers demonstrates the Space Force's commitment to achieving groundbreaking innovation as it conducts national security missions in space,' Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall said in an accompanying statement. 'This first of a kind maneuver from the X-37B is an incredibly important milestone for the United States Space Force as we seek to expand our aptitude and ability to perform in this challenging domain,' Gen. Chance Saltzman, Chief of Space Operations, also said. This all being said, there are immediate questions about whether or not this is actually a first-of-its-kind event for the X-37B, which is already known to be extremely maneuverable. It 'can do an orbit that looks like an egg and, when it’s close to the Earth, it’s close enough to the atmosphere to turn where it is,' then-Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson said at the annual Aspen Security Forum in 2019. 'Which means our adversaries don’t know – and that happens on the far side of the Earth from our adversaries – where it’s going to come up next. And we know that that drives them nuts. And I’m really glad about that.' It remains unclear what exactly Wilson was describing and whether this was a capability the X-37B had actually demonstrated at that time. The War Zone has posited in the past that this might have pointed to the mini-shuttle's having the ability to dip its wing into the Earth's atmosphere as it passed by, and to use that force to rapidly redirect its orbit. Wilson's comments were already highly curious at that time and fed into long-standing speculation about the exact capabilities and mission sets of the X-37B. The reusable spaceplane has a truckbed-sized main payload bay and can carry additional payloads on a service module adapter attached to its tail end.

U.S. Space Force One of the two X-37Bs with a payload adapted fitted to its rear end, seen here ahead of a record-setting mission that began in 2020 and ended in 2022. U.S. Space Force As The War Zone was first to report on in 2021, the specific unit within the Space Force that now oversees the X-37Bs, Space Delta 9, has what is still a very nebulous 'orbital warfare' mission. Space Delta 9 'is the focal point for preparing, presenting and projecting assigned and attached forces for the purpose of conducting protect and defend operations and providing national decision authorities with response options to deter orbital threats,' is how the Space Force described the unit's mission following a routine change in its top leadership earlier this year. Space-based early warning satellites are the most commonly cited capabilities in this ecosystem, as seen in the video below. Currently, the Air Force only acknowledges having only one 'counter-space' system, a terrestrial electronic warfare jammer called the Counter Communications System (CCS). 'We &#8230; are looking at the role of EW [electronic warfare], particularly against some of the space threats that are coming out,' Air Force Secretary Kendall told The War Zone and other outlets at a media roundtable on the sidelines of the Air & Space Forces Association's (AFA) main annual conference last month. 'So the space-based side of it's very important to us.' In the face of these ever-expanding threats to U.S. assets in orbit, including Russian work on a new space-based nuclear-armed anti-satellite weapon, Space Force is 'creating counter-space capabilities that allows us to be more resilient&#8230; and then when they [adversaries] have offensive capabilities of their own, our ability to either maneuver, to deny, to hide, to run,' Chief of Space Operations Saltzman said at a separate roundtable at the AFA conference. This came in response to a direct question on this topic from our own Howard Altman. When asked if he could further elaborate on these developments, Saltzman flatly said 'no.' Aerobraking maneuvers could be one means for space-based assets to evade hostile attacks. 'We must conduct&#8230; responsible counter-space campaigning,' Gen. Michael Guetlein, Vice Chief of Space Operations, also said while speaking at the Defense News Conference in September. 'This means we must develop capabilities to&#8230; protect and defend ourselves, but in doing so, we need to demonstrate safe and professional behavior in alignment with international norms of behavior, and we must work hard to protect the environment from additional pollution that could jeopardize the use of space for generations to come.' At that time, Guetlein noted that 'most of this kit is classified,' but that 'a lot of it is focused on defeating the adversary's kill webs, if necessary.' Patches seen on the shoulder of a member of Space Delta 9 during a change-of-command ceremony in July 2024. USSF In 2022, the U.S. government announced a self-imposed moratorium on destructive direct-ascent anti-satellite weapon testing and called on others to do the same. Such testing, like one Russia conducted in 2021, creates clouds of debris that pose significant threats to other objects in orbit. In addition, the new details today about the X-37B's operating envelope and activities as part of OTV-7 highlight additional outstanding questions about future reusable spaceplanes, including ones with greater offensive capabilities, that the U.S. military might be pursuing. Space Force's first-ever officially commissioned piece of artwork, seen below, notably explicitly depicts a reusable space plane intercepting a hostile 'killer satellite.' USSF The War Zone asked officials at the AFA conference last month about any plans to expand the X-37B fleet or develop a follow-on vehicle, which they declined to answer at the time. We have reached out since for more information, but have yet to receive a response. In the meantime, just what we know about the X-37B OTV-7 mission, including the newly disclosed planned aerobraking maneuvers and the previously announced novel high elliptical orbit, continues to be especially interesting in of itself.

Orphaned A-29 Super Tucano Attack Planes Join USAF Test Pilot Sch...	The renowned U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School (USAF TPS) at Edwards Air Force Base in California has received a trio of Embraer A-29 Super Tucano two-seat single-engine turboprop attack planes, which it says are its first newly assigned aircraft in almost three decades. Originally acquired to help Air Force special operations aviators train their foreign counterparts, the A-29s are now set to be used for various testing purposes, including of new weapons and sensors. The three A-29s touched down at Edwards back in August, but the Air Force's 412th Test Wing, which is responsible for the USAF TPS, only officially announced their arrival today. Pictures released along with the announcement show that one of the Super Tucanos, seen below, is still wearing a special heritage paint scheme that pays homage to the World War II-era 1st Air Commando Group, which supported allied forces in the China, Burma, and India (CBI) theater. The other two A-29s have standard overall gray paint jobs. The Super Tucanos all still look to be configured as light attack aircraft with a .50 caliber machine gun in each wing and the ability to carry various munitions and other stores on any of five pylons, two under each wing and one underneath the fuselage. The A-29 also has the ability to mount a sensor turret containing electro-optical and/or infrared cameras underneath its fuselage. USAF Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) received the three A-29s starting in 2021 to support its Combat Aviation Advisor (CAA). However, the service subsequently decided to stand down its two dedicated CAA units, the 6th and 711th Special Operations Squadrons, ostensibly as part of a broader shift in the U.S. military to preparing for future high-end fights after decades of counter-insurgency and other lower-intensity missions. CAAs had been heavily utilized during the Global War on Terror era, as you can read more about in this feature from Task & Purpose. The Air Force had also notably helped facilitate the delivery of Super Tucanos to various allies and partners over the years, especially the now-defunct Afghan Air Force, and otherwise experimented with the type in the past. As of last year, the Air Force's plan had been to completely divest AFSOC's A-29s, with one possibility being that they might get passed on to foreign countries. USAF TPS, which provides advanced flight training for experimental test pilots, flight test engineers, and flight test navigators, now seems to have eagerly accepted the orphaned turboprops. 'The Air Force Test Center and [Test Pilot] School leadership saw these excess aircraft as a unique opportunity to expand the flight test and training capabilities at Edwards,' according to today's release from the 412th Test Wing. 'The decision to transfer A-29 aircraft to Edwards is a result of thoughtful analysis by the Test Pilot School and an excellent example of command agility and collaboration to take advantage of a unique, fleeting opportunity,' Michael Banzet, director of plans and programs for the Air Force Test Center, also said in a statement. 'Not only does this repurpose a $63 million taxpayer investment, it also modernizes and expands TPS curriculum to accelerate the fielding of combat capability for the USAF.' One of the gray-painted A-29 Super Tucanos that is now assigned to the USAF TPS. USAF Interestingly, the Air Force has also explicitly cited the demands of the U.S. military's new focus on future high-end conflicts as having helped drive this decision. 'As part of a broader shift in response to Global Power Competition, the Air Force Test Pilot School’s mission is evolving to meet strategic need,' the release from the 412th Test Wing says. 'A refined three-pillar focus includes development of world-class staff, creating highly adaptive critical thinking test leaders, and advancing cutting-edge research.' USAF 'While the A-29’s airframe design is perfect for spin testing, the Super Tucano also offers an array of modern avionics with the ability to externally hang equipment through various wing pylons,' it continues. 'This will allow the school to conduct training and research on a variety of multi-domain sensors and weapons, reducing reliance on T-38 and F-16 aircraft while enhancing the ability to perform aspects of the developmental test mission tasked to the Air Force Test Center.' In addition to T-38s and F-16s, the USAF TPS regularly makes use of Air Force C-12s, which are militarized variants of the twin-engine turboprop Beechcraft King Air family. A picture of an A-29 equipped with a sensor turret in service with the now-defunct Afghan Air Force. USAF It's also interesting to note here that around the same time AFSOC first acquired the three A-29s, the Air Force also purchased a pair of Beechcraft AT-6E Wolverines to support light attack experimentation efforts. The Wolverine is based on the T-6 Texan II trainer, which is in service with the Air Force and the U.S. Navy. This included work on a low-cost communications and data-sharing architecture intended primarily for American allies and partners called Airborne Extensible Relay Over-Horizon Network, or AEROnet. The two-seat single-engine turboprop AT-6E is similar, but also different in many respects to the Super Tucano, as you can read more about here. The current status of those aircraft is not immediately clear. One of the two AT-6Es the Air Force acquired in the early 2020s. USAF The acquisition of the AT-6Es had evolved from a succession of abortive Air Force light attack aircraft programs starting around 2017, which had in turn followed on-again-off-again interest in such a capability dating back even further. Those efforts have since evolved into U.S. Special Operations Command's Armed Overwatch program and the OA-1K Sky Warden, a light attack derivative of the Air Tractor AT-802 crop duster, which you can learn more about here. The arrival of the A-29s certainly comes at a particularly significant moment in time for USAF TPS. It is very actively involved at present in supporting work on artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous capabilities, and other advanced uncrewed aircraft efforts. This includes a milestone AI-driven dogfight involving the school's specialized X-62A test jet, a highly modified two-seat F-16D, earlier this year. Many of these developments are feeding into other programs, such as the Air Force's Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) effort. In this context, especially, using the A-29s to help free up F-16s, including the specialized X-62A, as well as T-38s for testing that requires their higher performance and other capabilities, makes good sense. The Super Tucanos do still offer high degrees of agility and performance, but at speeds closer to the USAF TPS' C-12s, allowing them to carry out tasks that fast jets simply cannot. The A-29s also have robust avionics packages that can be altered for all different test purposes. The A-29s give USAF TPS organic assets that are dissimilar from ones in widespread use in the U.S. military, as well. The school often contracts out for such aircraft to give students familiarity in a broader array of types. The speed and performance of the Super Tucanos would also make them well suited to acting as chase planes for drones. In addition, F-16s and T-38s could just have to fly less thanks to the arrival of the A-29s, helping to reduce operating costs and wear and tear on those jets. The Super Tucano offers a platform that is less expensive to fly, in general, regardless of what tasks it might be given. USAF If nothing else, the three ex-AFSOC A-29s are now entering a completely different chapter in their service to the Air Force.

Protective Nets To Shield F-22s Eyed For Airbase Swarmed By Myste...	U.S. Air Force officials at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia are looking at installing anti-drone nets to help protect F-22 Raptor stealth fighters on the flightline. This comes nearly a year after the base was subjected to waves of still-mysterious drone incursions, which The War Zone was first to report. It also underscores the U.S. military's continued lag when it comes to responding to the very real threats posed by uncrewed aerial systems, at home and aboard, and particular hurdles to doing so domestically. Langley's 633rd Contracting Squadron put out a notice on October 4 asking for information about potential counter-drone netting that could be installed around up to 42 existing open-ended sunshade-type shelters at the base. Langley, now technically part of Joint Base Langley-Eustis, is one of a select few bases to host F-22s and is a key component of the Air Force's posture to defend the U.S. homeland. A pair of F-22 Raptor stealth fighters turn on final approach to Langley Air Force Base in Virginia. USAF The 633rd 'is in the process of determining the acquisition strategy to obtain non-personal services for the Unmanned Ariel Services (UAS) Netting for East Ramp Metal Sunshades,' according to the contracting notice. 'The intention of the netting is to deter and ultimately prevent the intrusion of UAS’s near airmen and aircraft. This initial sunshade netting installation on the metal sunshade (bay Alpha 1) shall serve as a proof of concept for the remaining sunshades.' The 'netting should be capable of disabling a Group 1/ 'Small' Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), such as the DJI Matrice 300 RTK, while remaining attached,' the notice explains. Per the U.S. military's definitions, drones in Group 1 can have weights of up to 20 pounds, fly up to 1,200 feet, and reach speeds of up to 100 knots. The 'netting shall be composed of a UV-resistant, moisture-resistant material capable of withstanding temperatures up to 400°F without damage. It shall also have a tensile strength of 200 lbs. or greater. Polyester or nylon are preferred materials, but any material with adequate properties is acceptable. Netting squares shall be no larger than 3' across,' the notice adds. 'Additional hardware and cabling should be strong enough to support the net and potential push or pull due to 40 mph winds when the netting is deployed and 120 mph (3-second gust) when netting is retracted/stowed. When retracted/stowed, the netting must be adequately secured. Lead core or other forms of weights installed along the bottom of the netting may be necessary to prevent the netting from blowing into aircraft or personnel; design may include recessed anchoring to existing concrete pad. Alternative means of anchoring the netting may also be acceptable.' However the nets are configured and installed, the 633rd says they need to be 'quickly and easily retractable' so F-22s can get in and out without issue. The installations also can't impede movement along the adjacent taxiways in any way. A graphic offering general details about the sunshade-type shelters at Langley that could now be in line to receive anti-drone nets. USAF In May, the 4th Contracting Squadron at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina put out a similar call for potential 'passive' drone defense options, which could also include nets, to help protect that base's F-15E Strike Eagle combat jets. As already noted, the possibility now of adding anti-drone nets to the sunshades at Langley comes after that base experienced a series of still-unexplained drone incursions over the course of several weeks last December. Though the Air Force said at the time that there did not appear to be any 'hostile intent' behind those incidents, they still prompted a major whole-of-government response that you can read more about in detail here. Langely had been subjected to unauthorized drone incursions before then that the Air Force acknowledged had both disrupted operations at the base and highlighted potential threats, as well. 'One day last week I had two small UASs that were interfering with operations… At one base [Langley], the gate guard watched one fly over the top of the gate check, tracked it while it flew over the flight line for a little while, and then flew back out and left,' now-retired Air Force Gen. James 'Mike' Holmes, then head of Air Combat Command (ACC), said back in 2017. 'Imagine a world where somebody flies a couple hundred of those and flies one down the intake of my F-22s with just a small weapon on it.' When that news emerged, The War Zone noted that it would be ever easier for a hostile actor to simply target aircraft exposed while parked on the flightline. Doing so would also offer adversaries a means to neutralize large numbers of planes before they could even into the fight. A F-22 exits a sunshade-type shelter at Langley Air Force Base. USAF Samuel King Jr. The War Zone has otherwise been sounding the alarm about threats posed on and off traditional battlefields by drones, including small commercial types like the DJI Matrice 300 RTK mentioned in the 633rd's contracting notice that can be readily weaponized, for many years now. Worrisome incidents around U.S. bases and other military assets domestically, including ships off the coast of Southern California and aircraft flying in restricted airspace, as well as critical non-military infrastructure within the United States have only continued to emerge in recent years. Just in August, we were the first to report on a series of mysterious drone incursions around the Air Force's Plant 42 in Palmdale, California, which ultimately led to the imposition of new temporary flight restrictions around the facility. Plant 42 is a top hub for advanced aerospace development work, including highly classified military programs like the B-21 Raider stealth bomber. The first pre-production B-21 Raider in a hangar at Plant 42. USAF The first B-21 in a hangar at Plant 42. USAF This is a concerning trend that has now also been steadily emerging globally. The ongoing fighting in Ukraine has now fully driven the reality of uncrewed aerial threats, especially when it comes to highly maneuverable first-person view (FPV) kamikaze drones and other smaller weaponized types, into the mainstream discourse. Both Ukrainian and Russian forces have actively been targeting each other's aircraft on the ground, including with drones and over great distances.

The bar to entry, particularly when it comes to acquiring and employing FPV-type and other smaller weaponized drones, is already very low. This all, in turn, has also prompted a new explosion in demand for counter-drone capabilities, including within the U.S. military. It's interesting to note here that nets were among the first countermeasures to emerge on the battlefield in Ukraine. This morning there was a video with anti-drone nets hanging Wagner above the road near Bakhmut, and already in the evening a video testing their effectiveness pic.twitter.com/eGXVbfsrJ1&mdash; MilitaryNewsUA (@front_ukrainian) September 25, 2023 Installing nets at Langley certainly represents one option for helping to address threats posed by smaller drones, but also one that would be most useful as part of a larger layered array of active and passive defensive measures. As the 633rd's contracting notice makes clear, the immediate goal with the nets is only to shield against very localized intrusions by the lowest tier of drones. The fact that this initial contracting process has only begun now after the December drone incursions and the ones in 2017, which are just the incidents at Langley we know about, is also telling. This comes amid a larger debate inside the U.S. military and out about how best to protect American military bases and other assets domestically, as well as forces in the field, from drones. Members of Congress have been particularly vocal in recent months in their criticism of steps the U.S. military has taken to date, especially when it comes to hardening physical infrastructure against uncrewed aerial systems and other threats, as you can read more about in detail here. An F-22 taxis away from a hangar at Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany during a deployment there in 2015. The Air Force is currently engaged in a particularly vocal debate about whether it should be building more robust shelters to protect its aircraft from drones and other threats. USAF At the same time, the U.S. military also continues to be faced with a morass of often convoluted legal, regulatory, and other challenges when it comes to implementing counter-drone capabilities domestically. The previous contracting notice from Seymour Johnson explicitly highlighted the attractiveness of 'passive' defense options since they are not subject to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) restrictions. Efforts have been made in the past to try to expand and otherwise streamline authorities available to U.S. military forces to take more active actions against drone threats, but issues clearly remain. These same factors also apply to other branches of the U.S. government. There have been legislative proposals from members of Congress just in the past few months to give new domestic counter-drone authorities to the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice, and the Central Intelligence Agency. The recent anti-drone net contracting notice Langley only further underscores the critical need now to address these issues and otherwise take steps to help defend bases and other key assets against uncrewed aerial threats with an array of capabilities.

Hurricane Milton Could Be Sum Of All Weather Fears For MacDill Ai...	Surrounded by more than seven miles of coastline and sitting just 14 feet above sea level at its highest elevation, MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida juts out into Hillsborough Bay like a uvula. Given its location, longstanding concerns exist that a major hurricane could swamp the headquarters of U.S. Central Command, U.S. Special Operations Command and dozens of other base tenant units. Now Hurricane Milton is storming its way toward Florida’s west coast, expected to make landfall south of Tampa as a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of up to 160 miles per hour. Two weeks after suffering damage from Hurricane Helene, MacDill officials are preparing for what could be storm effects unlike anything this base has seen in its 83 years of operations. Google Earth view of MacDill AFB that sits in the heart of the bay in Tampa. (Google Earth) Google Earth image Even though Helene made landfall in Perry, Florida, about 160 miles north of MacDill, the base saw a record-breaking storm surge of seven feet, nine inches, a spokesperson for the 6th Air Refueling Wing (ARW), the base host unit, told The War Zone. The latest forecast as of Noon Eastern time Wednesday shows Milton, a massive hurricane, striking Sarasota, about 35 miles south of the base.

Laura Anderson told The War Zone Wednesday morning. BREAKING: The storm surge for Hurricane Milton is expected to be 15 feet.To give you an idea of how deadly this is, here's what 9 feet looks like:pic.twitter.com/0SxfrA9XK3 Financelot (@FinanceLancelot) October 8, 2024 The base, however, is still within the cone of uncertainty, meaning that Milton could still strike it directly or come very close. That would be devastating to the entire Tampa Bay region with a population of more than 3.3 million people and put most of MacDill under water. 'Approximately 93% of MacDill AFB is within the 100-year floodplain,' according to a 2022 base resource management plan. 'Tropical storms typically flood much of the southern and northwestern portions of MacDill, and all of the base proper would be flooded by a Category 3 or greater hurricane.' Anticipating MacDill could be hit hard, Col. Ed Szczepanik, the installation commander, ordered a mandatory evacuation of the base on Oct. 7, effective by Oct. 8. The base has 26 KC-135 Stratotankers flown by the 6th ARW and the 927 ARW. All that were able to fly left for McConnell Air Force Base in Wichita Kansas. There are also Black Hawk helicopters from an Army Reserve unit that have evacuated as well. The 20,000 people who work on MacDill as well as the residents of nearly 600 homes were ordered to leave the base.

Aircraft were relocated due to projected winds and are expected to return once flying conditions are favorable. (U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Sterling Sutton) All this is taking place as turmoil roils CENTCOM’s area of responsibility. Israel has promised to launch a retaliation attack on Iran. It is also fighting Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis, who have waged a nearly year-long campaign attacking shipping in the Red Sea region. 'We are maintaining 24-7 operations working out of alternative sites,' CENTCOM spokesman Col. John Rigsbee told The War Zone. Opened in 2011, CENTCOM’s headquarters is one of the newest buildings on MacDill. It was constructed to withstand hurricane-force winds and rising water. 'We are preparing for the worst,' Rigsbee explained. 'We won’t know until we see the full extent of damage, but we are fully prepared to continue operations even if systems at headquarters are down. There are plans in place to maintain operations. We are not going down and it won’t take too much time to return.' The new CENTCOM headquarters, which opened in 2011, was built to withstand hurricanes. (Clark Construction) In the meantime, CENTCOM personnel are working out of several locations, including Raymond James Stadium and Homestead Air Reserve Base near Miami, where the Joint Operations Center will be set up, a U.S. defense official told The War Zone. SOCOM 'dispersed to three different locations,' Col. Alexandra Weiskopf, the command spokesperson, told The War Zone. 'With our Washington D.C. office, we will have comms up in four different locations and there will be no degradation to our continuity of operations.' MacDill being devastated by a hurricane is something 'we always thought was a possibility,' retired Army Gen. Joseph Votel, who ran both commands, told us. 'There was a plan to use Raymond James in the event of a serious issue at MacDill. I always thought SOCOM headquarters was very vulnerable - but CENTCOM headquarters was built with a hurricane in mind.' The SOCOM building 'was old and only two stories,' Votel explained. 'Power sources and data centers were largely at ground level.' An aerial view of McDill AFB. (Tatiraju.rishabh/wikicommons) As for concerns about the base being so badly damaged, that it would remain unusable, Votel said he didn’t 'recall any discussions about never coming back - we may have lacked imagination.' The 6th ARW will have a 185-member hurricane recovery team at Raymond James Stadium ready to assess any damage as soon as it is safe enough, Capt. Kaitlin Butler, a wing spokesperson, told us. Meanwhile, the base is still in the last throes of post-Helene cleanup. 'The biggest problems with Helene were storm surge and power outages,' Butler said. There was some flooding affecting the water treatment facility, she added, but for the most part, full base operations were quickly restored.

Kaitlin Butler and 2nd Lt. Laura Anderson) A direct or close hit could be a different story. The Defense Department is spending nearly $5 billion to rebuild Tyndall Air Force Base in the Florida Panhandle, which was directly in the path of Category 5 Hurricane Michael on Oct. 10, 2018. Most of that damage was caused by the winds blowing in at 160 miles per hour. Aircraft that were left behind faced damage or destruction.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images) Scott Olson There are other military installations in Florida preparing to deal with Milton, including those on Florida's east coast, near where Milton could cross over. 'Space Launch Delta 45 is monitoring Hurricane Milton and will continue making preparations as weather dictates,' spokeswoman Maggie Nave told us. 'Patrick Space Force Base and Cape Canaveral Space Force Station have entered [hurricane preparation] HURCON status, which will be adjusted based on the anticipated timing of storm impacts. At this time, tenant units have moved aircraft assets out of the local area.' Naval Station Mayport has sent three Arleigh Burke class guided missile destroyers underway, while those vessels unable to leave are being placed on heavy moorings, spokesman David Holmes told us. The station has shut down operations and only essential mission personnel are allowed in. Naval Air Station Jacksonville is being closed for two days, with personnel slated to come back as early as Friday depending on what happens, spokesperson Kaylee Larocque told us. In addition '26 U.S. Navy MH-60R Seahawks and approximately 200 personnel from Naval Station Mayport and Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Florida relocated to Maxwell Air Force Base in preparation for Hurricane Milton,' according to officials there. The preparations being made for Hurricane Milton are another stark reminder of how climate is affecting the military, especially in locations like Florida prone to these natural disasters While there are no plans to shutter places like MacDill and Tyndall, the cost to keep them operational in the face of major hurricanes like Milton will only rise.

Signs Point To North Korea Building A Nuclear-Powered Submarine: ...	North Korea appears to have started building a new submarine, which may feature nuclear propulsion, according to a South Korean official. The development would be in line with previous reports and follows the launch, last September, of a reworked Cold War-era Romeo class diesel-electric submarine designed to carry ballistic missiles. You can read more about that ‘Frankensub’ project here. 'Partial signs that appear to be the start of the submarine’s construction have been detected,' South Korea’s Defense Intelligence Agency said in a report to Representative Kang Dae-sik of the ruling People Power Party. 'As construction is still in its early stages, further confirmation is needed on whether it is nuclear powered,' the report said. A satellite image of the Pongdae Submarine Factory on the northeast coast of North Korea, the center of its submarine development activities. Google Earth An unnamed South Korean military official told the country’s Yonhap News Agency that construction work on the submarine had been identified in the northeastern Sinpo area — presumably at the Pongdae Submarine Factory — and that the boat was bigger than previous ones fielded by North Korea. 'Its exact tonnage and other [details] can be accurately determined once progress is made,' the same official said. The South Korean military’s assessment that the new submarine could be nuclear-powered seems to be based on its size, with no publicly available evidence at this point that North Korea has developed a suitable nuclear reactor for such a boat. However, there have been statements from the leadership in Pyongyang that a nuclear-powered submarine is planned. At the Party Congress in January 2021, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un announced that 'the design of a new nuclear-powered submarine was researched and was in the stage of final examination.' Kim added that design work on various weapons and sensors for such a design had already been completed. A man watches a television screen showing news footage of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un attending the Party Congress in Pyongyang, on January 6, 2021. Photo by JUNG YEON-JE/AFP via Getty Images JUNG YEON-JE A future North Korean nuclear-powered submarine was mentioned by the country’s state media after Kim presided over the launch ceremony for the diesel-electric submarine named Hero Kim Kun Ok (hull number 841) that took place at Sinpo on September 6, 2023. The North Korean diesel-electric submarine Hero Kim Kun Ok (hull number 841). KCNA There were also reports from earlier this year that work on such a boat might already be underway. In January, Kim is said to have inspected a nuclear-powered submarine under construction, as well as watching a 'strategic cruise missile' test. These events were reported by Pyongyang’s state media, but no photos or further details of the new submarine were released. Again, Sinpo was identified as the likely location of the construction work. State media reports on Kim inspecting the nuclear submarine project for the first time, but doesn't show images of the sub. Also says cruise missiles were launched from underwater but doesn't show the sub involved (if it wasn't a submersible barge anyway) Colin Zwirko (@ColinZwirko) January 28, 2024 Kim was said to have received 'a detailed understanding of the nuclear submarine construction' as well as providing instructions about 'issues' related to it. It should be noted that, despite these reports, the choice of nuclear propulsion for North Korea’s next submarine remains unconfirmed and there has been skepticism in the past whether such ambitions are even realistic. Historically, submarine reactors have been particularly complex to master, given the demanding integration and power-generation requirements. The ability of North Korea to build a nuclear-powered submarine is certainly questionable, although the country’s increasingly close relations with Russia since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine could well have provided Pyongyang with technologies and expertise that would help achieve this. Since the start of North Korea’s military support for Russia in the war in Ukraine, TWZ has raised the possibility of reciprocal assistance from Moscow, which could well focus on nuclear and advanced missile technologies. Help in building a new submarine might also be an option. If the Hero Kim Kun Ok reflects the current state of the art of North Korea’s submarine-building capabilities, then a nuclear-powered design does indeed look a long way off, although it’s not impossible. The Hero Kim Kun Ok is essentially a very deep rework of a Soviet-designed Romeo class diesel-electric submarine with a new capability for submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), thanks to a grafted-on missile compartment behind the sail. As well as SLBMs, the submarine appears to be able to launch cruise missiles, or perhaps SLBMs of two different sizes (offering differing ranges and payloads). Hatches in the missile compartment of the Hero Kim Kun Ok. The forward four are larger than the rear six, indicating a mix of missile payloads. KCNA Despite its bizarre appearance, the non-nuclear Hero Kim Kun Ok reinforces the fact that North Korea is busy trying to build a second-strike nuclear deterrent in the form of SLBMs and submarine-launched cruise missiles (SLCMs). The ‘Frankensub’ is far from ideal, however, as we have discussed before. If it becomes operational, it will be very noisy and easily tracked once on patrol. Furthermore, with only one or two boats capable of nuclear deterrent patrols, the North Korean nuclear second-strike deterrent is not the most credible. A nuclear-powered boat would offer huge benefits here, including essentially unlimited underwear endurance and potentially reduced acoustic signature, among others. Pyongyang’s previous efforts to field SLBMs onboard operational submarines have achieved only limited success. The lone example of the Gorae class is also based on a significantly modified Romeo class attack sub. Kim Jong Un, in gray in the foreground, talks to other North Korean officials while inspecting a Gorae (modified Romeo) class submarine. North Korean State TV capture That being said, the development of these submarines is still significant for North Korea, and building a new and larger submarine design — nuclear-powered or otherwise — would be the logical next step. It’s worth noting that Pyongyang has also struggled with fielding a workable SLBM, hampered to a significant degree by the lack of a genuinely suitable submarine to launch it from. At the same time, North Korea has developed increasingly large SLBMs, without any obvious submarine hull big enough to accommodate them. That, too, points to the development of a new and larger submarine design. SLBMs identified as the Pukguksong-5 on parade in January 2021. These are the biggest North Korean SLBMs seen so far. KCNA Presuming the new submarine is nuclear-powered, it’s possible that it could also be intended as a hunter-killer attack submarine, although North Korea’s emphasis on offensive missile capabilities would seem to make this much less likely. On the other hand, it could also be a testbed for new technologies, which would be especially useful if North Korea has actually developed a suitable reactor, or plans to, perhaps with Russian assistance. Speaking to TWZ, Alex Luck, an analyst who closely follows submarine developments, especially in the Indo-Pacific region, said that a nuclear-powered design would not be unexpected, based on previous official statements. However, 'the technical challenges would still seem daunting, assuming North Korea isn’t receiving assistance from elsewhere.' Luck said he hasn’t seen any detailed reports assessing that North Korea has developed a suitable reactor design, but also raises the possibility that the new submarine isn’t a 'classic nuclear-powered' boat, but perhaps some sort of hybrid. This could be a conventionally powered submarine with an auxiliary or experimental nuclear reactor, similar to how some reports describe the mysterious new (and unrelated) Chinese Type 041, or Zhou class submarine.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION PHOTO © 2024 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Interestingly, Luck also identifies a new assembly hall at Sinpo adjacent to the one in which the modified Romeo design was completed last year, which could also point to the new submarine design being built here. Luck also notes that it’s possible the ‘new’ submarine is actually another modified Romeo, which would seem operationally logical considering last year’s launch, although wouldn’t really explain the apparent size discrepancy. Kim riding on a Romeo class years ago. The type dates back to the 1950s and still makes up the backbone of the North Korean Navy’s submarine fleet. KCNA That explanation would, however, fit with Kim’s statement at the launch of the Hero Kim Kun Ok, during which he spoke of a 'plan to remodel existing medium-sized submarines into offensive ones loaded with tactical nuclear weapons to play an important role in modern warfare,' as part of what he described as a 'low-cost ultra-modernization strategy.' Overall, North Korea’s submarine force still dominates that of the South in terms of numbers, with as many as 86 boats, although this total includes midget submarines. South Korea operates around 21 submarines, although it’s also notably developing an SLBM capability for its latest diesel-electric boats. For now, South Korea is busily working on conventionally armed SLBMs, but there are growing suggestions that it might also look to introduce a nuclear capability in the future. This comes against the backdrop of worsening relations on the peninsula overall and an expanding dialogue between South Korea and the United States in terms of joint nuclear-planning exercises. South Korea is working to add a conventional SLBM capability to its Dosan Ahn Changho class diesel-electric submarines. DAPA Until we see some imagery or other technical detail, it’s too early to make any definitive conclusions, although there’s little doubt that submarines — and especially ones able to provide a second-strike deterrent capability — are a priority for North Korea.

New Vision For Lift Fan Aircraft Family Grows From Special Operat...	Aurora Flight Sciences has released new renderings of an uncrewed fan-in-wing vertical take-off-and-landing capable demonstrator aircraft it is currently working on, as well as of a revised vision for a scaled-up cargo aircraft based on the same technology. The demonstrator is being developed under a U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) program centered on interest in a new high-speed, runway-independent special operations transport plane. Aurora's unveiling of the new renders also comes amid growing interest from the U.S. Air Force in similar capabilities to support more general distributed logistics missions, especially in contested environments during future high-end conflicts. Aurora, a subsidiary of Boeing, shared the new renders and provided more information about the work it is doing as part of DARPA's Speed and Runway Independent Technologies (SPRINT) program earlier today. DARPA awarded new SPRINT contracts to Aurora, as well as Bell, earlier this year. SPRINT, which kicked off last year, is directly tied U.S. Special Operations Command’s (SOCOM) High-Speed Vertical Takeoff and Landing (HSVTOL) project. A rendering showing Aurora's current SPRINT uncrewed demonstrator design, at right, and a scaled-up crewed cargo aircraft concept based on the same technology, at left. Aurora Flight Sciences 'Aurora and Boeing are collaborating on the development of key technologies that combine to deliver a revolutionary solution to mobility challenges in contested environments and across distributed military bases,' according to a press release from Aurora. 'Fan-in-wing (FIW) technology combines an embedded lift fan with a blended wing body design to enable vertical lift agility without sacrificing the payload capacity and aerodynamic efficiency associated with today’s fixed wing aircraft.' 'The team is currently designing an uncrewed demonstrator with a 45-ft wingspan and 1,000-pound payload capacity for the SPRINT program,' the release adds. 'The propulsion system includes off-the-shelf turbofan and turboshaft engines that would power the vehicle to a maximum of 450 knots true airspeed (KTAS).' The new rendering of the SPRINT demonstrator is broadly in line with one that Aurora put out in May. It has a blended-wing platform with a v-tail along with three lift fans in a triangular arrangement – one to either side of the central fuselage section and another in the nose end. The revised render shows more streamlined intakes for the main engines underneath the body. One of the new renderings of Aurora's SPRINT demonstrator design. Aurora Flight Sciences A rendering Aurora released of its SPRINT demonstrator concept back in May. Aurora Flight Sciences A rendering of Aurora Flight Sciences revised SPRINT design concept. Aurora Flight Sciences 'Earlier this year, the team completed the first of three major test events scheduled for the current phase of the SPRINT program to prove out the feasibility of the FIW technology,' according to Aurora. 'The ground effect test, conducted using a 4.6-ft wingspan model with three lift fans, showed that suck down effects created by the lift fans in hover were negligible and that the landing gear is set to the appropriate height to minimize adverse pitching moments from forming during ground operations. Wind tunnel tests planned for late 2024 and early 2025 include a stability and control test using a 9-ft full wingspan aircraft model and a 5¼-ft semi-span embedded lift fan test to model aerodynamic effects.' A picture of an actual test article Aurora has been using in the development of its SPRINT demonstrator. Aurora Flight Sciences 'Aurora’s concept is designed to meet or exceed the challenging program objectives that DARPA set for the program. For example, the blended wing body platform is capable of 450 knot cruise speed, and the embedded lift fans with integrated covers allow a smooth transition from vertical to horizontal flight,' the company has also said in the past. 'The design also leverages existing engine solutions, shortening development risk and timelines. In addition to VTOL, the aircraft is capable of short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL), super short take-off and landing (SSTOL), and conventional take-off and landing.' Aurora is currently aiming to reach first flight with the SPRINT demonstrator in 2027. However, the company is already looking to the future. 'The technology demonstrated in the SPRINT X-plane could be scaled to medium and heavy lift aircraft, creating a future family of systems. For example, Aurora envisions a manned, 130-ft wingspan aircraft with four lift fans and 40-ft payload bay,' today's press release explains. 'The FIW aircraft could meet or exceed the payloads, ranges, and speeds typical of fixed wing military transport aircraft while delivering the tactical advantage of true vertical takeoff and landing.' The rendering Aurora has now released of this larger fan-in-wing design concept shows significant changes from the one it put out back in 2023. The new design has a tailless modified cranked kite planform with lower profile air intakes on top of the rear end of the central body. Like the 2023 render, Aurora's revised vision for a larger crewed fin-in-wing aircraft still features four lift fans two on either side of the central body. One of the new renderings of Aurora's scaled-up design derived from the SPRINT demonstrator. Aurora Flight Sciences The design seen in the new rendering appears to reduce some stealthy features and magnify others, notably with the elimination with the vertical tails. What Aurora showed in 2023 did have sharper and narrower wing sections, as well as a more pronounced beak-like nose and chine line along the forward edge of the central body. A rendering of a larger fan-in-wing design concept that Aurora released in relation to the SPRINT program back in 2023. Aurora Flight Sciences A rendering of Aurora Flight Sciences' SPRINT design concept. Aurora Flight Sciences The new Aurora rendering also notably shows changes to the design of the lift fan covers. The design the company presented last year had split covers – different versions of the original concept showed circular and hexagonal cover shapes – while the new one has multi-sectioned covers. This is very reminiscent of how the lift fan in the nose of the 1960s-era Ryan Vertifan was covered. The Vertifan had a three-fan configuration that is otherwise similar in some very broad respects to Aurora's SPRINT demonstrator design. An artist’s conception of a fan-in-wing Special Operations Forces Transport Aircraft (SOFA) concept from Lockheed in the 1980s also shows similar sectional fan coverings.

Lockheed via Ebay It is worth noting here that 40 feet is also how long the payload bay is on standard-length variants of the venerable C-130 family, which has long been used as a baseline for mid-tier military airlifter development. Boeing used this same dimensional rubric when crafting a concept that it unveiled last year for a new stealthy aircraft that could be configured as a transport or an aerial refueling tanker. That design, which is intended to take off and land from traditional runways, also has a blended wing body planform that is similar in some broad strokes to Aurora's proposed SPRINT-derived cargo plane. A stealthy blended wing body design concept Boeing unveiled publicly in 2023. Boeing A model depicting the blended wing body concept Boeing unveiled in January 2023. Boeing The War Zone has also previously pointed out on multiple occasions how Aurora's work under SPRINT is broadly evocative of a host of vertical and short takeoff and landing-capable designs the U.S. military has at least explored since the 1980s. Supporting special operations missions was a central theme in many of those past development efforts, as you can read about more in this exhaustive two-part feature. SPRINT together with HSVTOL underscores significant continued interest, especially within the Air Force special operations community, in new, more capable and survivable runway-independent platforms, especially to help get personnel in and out of denied or otherwise sensitive locales. The significant speed and range capabilities that both of those efforts are targeting could be particularly attractive for future operations across the broad expanses of the Pacific region. 'I think the high speed/range, high-speed kind of lower profile ability to get in and out of places that don't require long runways, I think that would be attractive to any combatant commander,' Air Force Lt. Gen. Michael Conley, head of Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), said in regards to SPRINT and HSVTOL at a media roundtable on the sidelines of the Air & Space Forces Association's (AFA) main annual conference last month. 'It's certainly a capability we need in the Indo-Pacific, just because of the geography, regardless of an [specific] adversary.' At the same time, it is not hard to see how the Air Force more broadly, as well as other branches of the U.S. military, might be interested in the kinds of capabilities that designs being developed under SPRINT and HSVTOL, or variants or derivatives thereof, might offer. The U.S. Marine Corps and the Air Force, especially, increasingly envision future operations, especially in the context of a high-end fight against a potential adversary like China, as dispersed affairs. Distributing forces across a large number of operating locations, including far-flung forward sites with limited infrastructure, is seen more and more as not only advantageous, but critical for reducing vulnerability. Large established bases will be prime targets in any future large-scale conflict.

Road operations are among the tactics seeing a resurgence within the U.S. military as part of broader efforts to reduce reliance on traditional runways. James Deboer A Marine F-35B sitting on a stretch of highway in California during a recent exercise. James Deboer In line with this, diverse and distributed logistics chains are also increasingly seen as essential for supporting these operations, especially in contested environments. A high-speed, long-range, runway-independent, and highly survivable cargo aircraft, crewed or uncrewed, could easily be a part of that future ecosystem. In fact, the Air Force Research Laboratory just put out a request for information (RFI) about potential Runway Independent Mobility / Next Generation Intra-theater Airlift (NGIA) aircraft last month. NGIA builds on an earlier concept dubbed Last Tactical Leg, according to Aviation Week, which was first to report on this development. 'The Last Tactical Leg proposal envisions an autonomous, hybrid-electric short- or vertical-takeoff-and-landing aircraft,' Aviation Week's story explains. 'This proposed airlifter would deliver small, urgently needed supplies from logistics hubs to forward bases, even with battle-damaged runways on both ends.' 'The Department of the Air Force’s (DAF’s) goal [with NGIA] is to enhance existing airlift capability and capacity with an intra-theater platform that can fight through damaged infrastructure on responsive timelines,' according to the RFI for that effort. AFRL is now 'seeking information on advanced configurations, propulsion and power generation/regulation concepts and technologies for a contested logistics aircraft with attributes for agility in the objective area, airlift capacity, speed, range and survivability to sustain joint force operations within the contested environment.' All of this sounds very much in line with Aurora's vision for scaled-up designs based on the SPRINT demonstrator. Bell has also previously laid out a concept for a scalable family of advanced tilt-rotor aircraft that is tied in with its SPRINT and HSVTOL work, and that you can read more about here. Bell previously teamed with Boeing to develop the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor, variants of which are in service with AFSOC, as well as with the Marines and U.S. Navy. A rendering Bell released in 2021 showing three tiers of HSVTOL concepts, including two crewed examples (at left and center) and a small uncrewed type (at right). Bell The Air Force and Marine Corps, as well as the U.S. Army, have already been exploring smaller uncrewed vertical takeoff and landing-capable drones to support logistics requirements and other mission sets. The Air Force has been experimenting with light fixed-wing aircraft converted into drones as small uncrewed airlifters, as well. It does still remains to be seen whether a working design of any kind emerges from SPRINT, HSVTOL, or NGIA. If one does, whether it actually enters operational service with the Air Force or any other branch of the U.S. military is also an open question. 'There's a lot of hard things,' AFOSC head Lt. Gen. Conley said at the AFA conference last month again while speaking about SPRINT and HSVTOL. 'Some of it's just the technological pieces of the engines and trying to get enough lift and enough size.' 'I think, conceptually as an Air Force, we struggle a little bit with how big is big enough &#8230; as you look at the developmental models, some of them are, you know, the size of a sedan. And then&#8230; another iteration would be the size of about a UH-60 [Black Hawk helicopter]. And then you get up to a little bigger &#8230; probably C-130 'lite,'' he continued. 'And I think as an Air Force that's used to move in a lot of big things, and a lot of people, and a lot of pallets, and big amounts of cargo, there's a little bit of a mental block there.' A C-130J Hercules, one of the main airlifters currently in U.S. military service. Lockheed Martin Conley's general sentiments here have been echoed by other Air Force officials in the past. 'There were … thousands, maybe, of C-47s, and they were all over the Pacific [during World War II],' Gen. Kenneth Wilsbach, then head of U.S. Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), said back in 2022. 'They weren’t fast, but they can carry a lot, and they tackled the logistics problem of the Pacific by having a lot of tails to … move equipment.' Although 'it got there at 120, maybe 150 knots … it worked,' he added. 'We could have something like that &#8230; where you don’t have to have it going 500 knots,' but the logistics effort wouldn’t 'eat a lot of tail numbers to be able to get the small bits of equipment and pieces to the various spots that we intend to deploy from.' 'Does it have to be manned? Can it be unmanned? Does it have to be 10,000 pounds or 5,000 pounds [payload capacity-wise]? Can I do vertical lift? Can I do it on an airship [or] a slow-moving low-altitude blimp?' now-retired Gen. Mike Minihan, then head of Air Mobility Command, asked rhetorically while speaking about future airlift requirements in an interview with Aviation Week last year. 'There’s a lot of opportunity when it comes to how you approach that.' It is worth remembering here that the Air Force did briefly operate a fleet of C-27J Spartan cargo aircraft between 2008 and 2013. Those aircraft had been acquired specifically to support intra-theater airlift requirements as part of what was originally a joint program with the Army. The Air Force ultimately curtailed those plans ostensibly due to budgetary limitations and divested all of its Spartans. Some of those C-27Js subsequently ended up in the Army's special operations aviation inventory. A C-27J Spartan assigned to US Army Special Operations Aviation Command. US Army SOCOM and AFSOC have clear interest currently in seeing SPRINT and HSVTOL through to the delivery of an operational capability. Aurora's latest renderings show how that work could further evolve into designs to support a wider array of mission sets.

Anduril’s Roadrunner Drone Hunting Drone Gets Expanded Order From...	Anduril's Roadrunner counter-drone interceptor drone just got a further stamp of approval from the Pentagon in the form of an order worth hundreds of millions of dollars to deliver additional units. This is a major win for Anduril, still a newcomer to the defense industry, whose rapidly growing product catalog largely aims at disrupting the existing marketplace. While some remain skeptical of the company's ambitious aspirations, continuing support from DoD is a signal that whatever they are doing is worth continued investment. You can read our deep dive on Roadrunner in our past feature linked here. Over 500 Roadrunner-Ms, as well as Pulsar electronic warfare systems, will be supplied as part of the nearly quarter-billion dollar deal, with deliveries beginning in 2024. Pulsar is a modular, AI-infused, networked, electronic warfare system that can be mounted on base stations, vehicles, and aircraft. The new order is roughly two and a half times the size of the DoD's past expenditures on both systems, which appears to have focused more on testing, demonstrations, and early integration work. The company's Lattice open architecture autonomy command and control software can be integrated with both systems. Anduril's AI-infused and networked Pulsar EW system comes in stationary, ground vehicle, and airborne offerings. This order shouldn't be too big of a surprise as the Pentagon continues to grapple with the rapidly expanding threat posed by lower-end drones and long-range one-way attack munitions. Roadrunner is vertically launched and recovered, and possesses a high degree of maneuverability thanks to its vectored thrust turbojets. It's optionally reusable. If one is launched and it is not needed to take down a threat, which could include drones, as well as cruise missiles and low-flying manned aircraft, it can be recovered and refueled for another mission. Depending on the configuration, it could also be used to surveil and strike targets on the ground or carry non-kinetic payloads. Roadrunners in 'Nest' launcher boxes can be distributed around a broad area to maximize response time and protection coverage. The idea is that Roadrunner can be launched on initial warning, or even preemptively, to get after a threat immediately without the possibility of wasting an effector in doing so if the intercept is not needed. Beyond defending troops and installations in forward locales, Roadrunner could be extremely useful aboard ships that have become top targets for drone attacks. We lay out this entire use case in great detail in this past feature. In a press release, Anduril says that 'Roadrunner has been operationally deployed for Combat Evaluation since January 2024 and Pulsar has been operationally deployed in multiple regions since August 2023.' In other words, Roadrunner and Pulsar have been used in the field, at least in an evaluative manner, which appears to have been a success. Similar kinetic counter-UAS systems, such as Raytheon's Coyote, as well as electronic warfare systems, have been put into operational use for years now, most notably at high-threat locations in the Middle East. Smaller past contracts related to Roadrunner and Pulsar likely involved more limited use case deployments that have subsequently led to this expanded buy. It is not chasing the same requirement as the Coyote Blk 2. There are two different programs, one that builds on the B-Blk2 on LIDS, and another that meets a SOCOM program need. Roadrunner has been shown as a SOCOM future need in DOD materials for several months now. pic.twitter.com/tkk0nP6YaA&mdash; AirPower 2.0 (MIL_STD) (@AirPowerNEW1) December 1, 2023 We reached out to Anduril regarding where their Roadrunner and Pulsar systems have been deployed and what type of action they have seen, but they could not provide any additional details at this time. What's clear is that the Pentagon thinks they are effective enough to want more of them. Considering how both of these capabilities would be critical to a future fight, especially a distributed one across the Pacific, if Roadrunner and Pulsar continue to prove their worth and evolve into even more potent weapons, these orders could quickly become exponentially larger.

Stealthy Uncrewed Combat Air Vehicle To Work Alongside Future Fre...	France has unveiled plans to develop a new uncrewed combat air vehicle (UCAV) that will complement the forthcoming Rafale F5 crewed fighter, as part of a new-look French Air and Space Force. The industrial side of the drone program will be headed up by Dassault Aviation, drawing upon its previous nEUROn UCAV demonstrator, which has already been used in trials with crewed combat aircraft. The program was announced today by France’s Minister of the Armed Forces Sébastien Lecornu, during a ceremony marking the 60th anniversary of the French Strategic Air Forces (FAS) at Saint-Dizier Air Base. Sur la base aérienne 113 de Saint-Dizier pour les 60 ans des Forces aériennes stratégiques, @SebLecornu annonce une évolution majeure pour la dissuasion nucléaire aéroportée française : le nouveau standard du Rafale, le F5, qui emportera le futur missile nucléaire ASN4G.Le… pic.twitter.com/WfuOi24PWO&mdash; Ministère des Armées et des Anciens combattants (@Armees_Gouv) October 8, 2024 'This stealth combat drone will contribute to the technological and operational superiority of the French Air Force by 2033,' explained Éric Trappier, chairman and CEO of Dassault, in a statement. 'It is significant that it is being initiated today, as we mark the 60th anniversary of the Strategic Air Forces and the 90th anniversary of the Air and Space Force: in aeronautics — a highly complex field — the future has deep roots, and innovation is built on experience. Dassault Aviation and its partners are proud to serve the French Armed Forces and the French Defense Procurement Agency (DGA).' France’s Minister of the Armed Forces Sébastien Lecornu, during the ceremony marking the 60th anniversary of the French Strategic Air Forces (FAS) at Saint-Dizier Air Base today. French Ministry of Defense Some details were provided about the capabilities of the new drone and the kinds of technologies it will incorporate. The drone — as yet unnamed — will be 'complementary to the Rafale and suited to collaborative combat.' It will also have stealth characteristics including an internal payload. The UCAV will feature autonomous control, with a human-in-the-loop (in this case, the pilot in the cockpit of the Rafale). A French Air and Space Force Rafale C. Dassault Aviation Dassault Aviation/Anthony Pecchi According to Dassault, the drone 'will be highly versatile and designed to evolve in line with future threats,' although no further information was provided about its expected performance or even the range of missions it will fly. It may or may not be relevant that a Dassault press release today refers to the new drone working alongside the Rafale F5 'like the Mirage IV … [to] ensure France’s independence and capability superiority in the coming decades.' A French Air Force Dassault Mirage IVA nuclear bomber emerges from its shelter in the mid-1960s. Photo by llstein bild/ullstein bild via Getty Images ullstein bild Dtl. This would appear to be a specific reference to France’s airborne nuclear deterrent, a role undertaken by FAS using the Rafale. In the past, the mission was carried out by the Mirage IV. It may be that this is a reference to the drone supporting the Rafale on nuclear penetration missions, clearing the way for strikes, for example. On the other hand, it may simply be a more general reference based on the announcement being made at an FAS air base. As for the F5 Standard of the Rafale that the new drone will be expected to support, this is planned to keep the multirole combat aircraft in frontline service until around 2060. Initial studies for the F5 Standard were initiated last year, with full-scale development to begin in the 2026-27 timeframe. This means that the aircraft can be closely tailored to enable crewed-uncrewed teaming with the new drone. In the past, it’s been stated that the Rafale F5 would have a focus on collaborative combat, as well as incorporating new-generation weapons. These weapons are planned to include the ASN4G, the next-generation standoff nuclear weapon for the French Armed Forces, replacing the current ASMPA. ASMPA on a Rafale. MBDA Other new weapons for the Rafale F5 are expected to include successors for the SCALP conventional cruise missile and Exocet anti-ship missile, with a hypersonic design being examined for the latter requirement. Air-to-air munitions should include an upgraded Meteor beyond-visual-range missile. Suppression and destruction of enemy air defenses (SEAD/DEAD) is also seen as a primary mission for the Rafale F5 and one that would benefit hugely from a loyal-wingman-type drone to operate alongside the crewed fighter. Other efforts to enhance the survivability of the Rafale F5 may include conformal fuel tanks and radar-cross-section reduction kits, although the fighter will certainly not be truly stealthy, making a drone wingman all the more valuable. Since the Rafale F5 is being developed with the Future Combat Air System (FCAS) in mind, it’s very likely that the new drone will also be designed to operate within this broader architecture. Not to be confused with the U.K.-led effort of the same name, the pan-European FCAS will include uncrewed air vehicles as well as uncrewed effectors and remote weapon carriers, some of which can be air-launched and which will increasingly blur the distinction between cruise missiles and drones. The centerpiece of FCAS will eventually be a crewed combat aircraft, the Next Generation Fighter (NGF), which should eventually replace the Rafale, among others. An infographic describing the various components of Airbus’ FCAS concept, including the 'new fighter,' which is now known as the Next Generation Fighter. Airbus The Rafale is also available in a two-seat version, which would appear to lend itself especially well to the 'drone controller' role, potentially with a dedicated rear cockpit for teaming up with UCAVs. Similar concepts are also being explored in China and the U.S. Air Force has also eyed its two-seat F-15EX as a possible candidate for working with loyal wingman drones. While we don’t know what the new drone announced today will look like, nor do we have an idea of its size, it seems likely that it will at least be informed by the Dassault nEUROn, a UCAV demonstrator that you can read more about here. The stealthy nEUROn is a flying-wing-type drone, launched in 2003 as a pan-European project, but headed up by Dassault of France. The nEUROn was first flown in December 2012 and has so far conducted more than 170 test flights. nEUROn under construction. Dassault Aviation Sebastien Rande Notably, some of these tests have included determining the UCAV’s ability to remain undetected and penetrate air defense networks. In 2016, the drone was reportedly able to successfully breach the air defense perimeter around the French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle, a clear demonstration of its stealth characteristics. Today’s announcement might be bad news for Airbus, which unveiled its fighter-like stealthy Wingman uncrewed concept aircraft this summer. Also intended to fly collaborative missions alongside crewed fighters, the Wingman has been pitched as a low-cost solution — with a price tag equivalent to one-third that of a modern crewed fighter — that can be brought into production and fielded rapidly. The Airbus Wingman uncrewed concept aircraft, which broke cover earlier this year. Thomas Newdick Thomas Newdick In relation to Wingman, Airbus noted that the German Air Force had 'expressed a clear need' for a drone that would be able to operate in conjunction with crewed fighters before the arrival in service of the pan-European FCAS. With Airbus already playing a major role in FCAS, the company may have hoped that Wingman would also attract interest from other countries involved in that initiative: Belgium, France, and Spain. So far, there’s no sign that France is interested in Wingman, although it’s hard to envisage that Airbus could develop and build this UCAV solely to meet a German requirement for an uncrewed companion that can work alongside its forthcoming Eurofighter EK electronic warfare jets, which seem likely to be a major driver behind it. An artist’s concept of the Eurofighter EK electronic warfare aircraft for Germany. Like the Rafale F5, it’s intended to go to war accompanied by UCAVs. Airbus At the same time, Wingman is expected to enter service in the 2030s timeframe, at much the same time as the new Dassault UCAV. It’s certainly questionable whether the European defense industry can support two apparently overlapping if not competing, programs. Without any concept art or details of the design of the new Dassault UCAV, we can’t say for sure whether it will follow the pattern established by nEUROn, although that certainly seems possible if not probable. If this is indeed the case, the launch of this program again highlights an apparent gap in the U.S. combat aircraft space as well as the growing interest in stealthy UCAVs in other countries. For some time now, drones in this category have become attractive as a far more cost-effective and more capable alternative to crewed aircraft to satisfy a number of missions, especially the more hazardous ones. In particular, China has been pushing ahead with the development of UCAVs for exactly these reasons, with other programs being pursued in Russia and elsewhere. The news from France today suggests that the trend for UCAVs — flying wing or otherwise — is only likely to grow exponentially as time goes on.

Trophy Armored Vehicle Protection System Gains New Ability To Def...	Israeli defense contractor Rafael says it has developed a new version of its combat-proven Trophy active protection system (APS) that is better able to defeat top-down attacks. Increasing Trophy's ability to engage threats attacking from above could be particularly valuable for swatting down hostile drones, including highly maneuverable first-person view kamikaze (FPV) types and ones designed to drop small munitions straight down on their targets. The War Zone previously laid out a detailed case for how hard-kill APSs like Trophy could help give tanks and other armored vehicles a critical additional layer of protection against these threats, which the war in Ukraine has brought fully into the public view. Rafael publicly unveiled Trophy's new top-attack defense capability today, which can be seen demonstrated in the video below, including against a target drone. The video also includes multiple clips from the conflict in Ukraine, including one captured via the camera on an FPV drone right before it hits its mark, as well as various flash points in the Middle East. Trophy was first developed in the late 2000s and was originally primarily designed to defend against anti-tank guided missiles and other types of infantry anti-armor weapons like shoulder-fired rockets and rocket-propelled grenades. Trophy's existing core components are an array of small radars and launchers pre-loaded with ‘hard-kill’ projectiles. The radars detect incoming threats and cue the launchers, which then fire their projectiles. Though a small explosive charge is used to propel them, the projectiles themselves are kinetic, being designed to destroy, or at least disrupt, whatever they hit through sheer force of impact. 'Rafael officials unveiled the [top-attack defense] upgrade in a briefing here last week held ahead of the AUSA [Association of the U.S. Army] arms exhibition in Washington next week, where the company will exhibit its wares,' according to a report from Defense News. 'The company declined to specify how the upgrade works or when the capability was first introduced on Trophy, saying only the system had undergone numerous development cycles since first being fielded more than ten years ago.' The imagery Rafael has now released highlighting Trophy's new top-down defense capabilities does show pronounced explosive blasts. It is unclear whether this reflects the launch of additional kinetic interceptors, the use of an actual explosive charge to defeat incoming threats, and/or secondary explosions from successful interceptions. Regardless of how the improved system functions, it offers additional coverage against drones and other threats from above like anti-tank guided missiles with top-down attack capability. A screen capture from Rafael latest Trophy promotional video highlighting the new top-down defensive capability with a significant explosive blast visible.

Rafael capture The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) first began fielding Trophy on its Merkava tanks in 2009. The system, which is now in increasing service globally, including with the U.S. military, has since demonstrated its value in combat many times. The video below from fighting in the Gaza Strip in December 2023 offers a prime view of the system in action. New Hamas clash footage from Khan Yunis, southern Gaza. pic.twitter.com/YPysrg4CmZ&mdash; Clash Report (@clashreport) December 13, 2023 However, it has long been known that Trophy has certain limitations against threats approaching from steep downward angles, something Rafael itself has made no secret of in the past. The system 'provides 360° protection in azimuth as well as extensive elevation coverage,' according to official marketing material. The potential vulnerabilities that the limits to Trophy's 'elevation coverage' present have come more into view since Hamas’ large-scale terrorist attacks on southern Israel on October 7, 2023. The Palestinian terrorist group used drones to drop small munitions on top of Israeli Merkava tanks and other vehicles, as well as static defenses. It is unclear whether or not the Trophys on the Merkavas were in operation at the time of those attacks, but they still prompted new discussions about the system's top-down defense deficiencies.

The Pentagon just recently announced that defeating drones, an area where the U.S. military continues to lag behind, will be the focus of a new Replicator 2 rapid fielding initiative. The original Replicator effort has been focused on getting uncrewed systems into the hands of American forces. The idea of using Trophy and other hard-kill APSs to provide an existing and relatively quick avenue for adding anti-drone defenses to tanks and other armored vehicles is also now new, as you can learn more about in detail in our past deep-drive on this exact topic. At the same time, it is important to note that APSs are not a silver bullet solution to drone threats, which look to be on the cusp of another major evolution, if not a revolution driven heavily by advances in artificial intelligence, the subject of another recent War Zone feature. Layered defenses, including other systems mounted on vehicles and ones otherwise deployed around the battlespace, will be key to meeting current and future counter-drone requirements. This will be especially true when it comes to defeating large-volume attacks, including ones involving networked swarms. A counter-drone ecosystem that includes high-power laser and microwave directed energy weapons, laser dazzlers, and electronic warfare jammers, as well as traditional guns and surface-to-air missiles, is already emerging. With all this in mind, Rafael's new top-down defense upgrade for Trophy is not only logical, but is likely a sign of things to come from other APS manufacturers as critical demand for new and improved ways to defend tanks and other armored vehicles against drones keeps growing.

France Confirms Upgraded Mirage 2000s Heading To Ukraine In Early...	France has announced details of its plans to put surplus Dassault Mirage 2000 fighters into Ukrainian hands, with these jets receiving new air-to-ground capabilities ahead of planned deliveries starting in the first quarter of 2025. The delta-winged jet is set to become the second Western-made fighter to be provided to Kyiv, following the F-16, the first of which arrived in Ukraine this summer. In a statement on X today, the French Minister of the Armed Forces Sébastien Lecornu added that the Mirage 2000s will first be outfitted with new electronic self-defense equipment as well as undisclosed modifications that will allow them to fly air-to-ground missions. That work will be conducted at Cazaux in southwest France. Meanwhile, the training of Ukrainian pilots and mechanics continues, Lecornu said. Mirage 2000 à destination de l’Ukraine : livraison toujours prévue au 1er trimestre 2025.À Cazaux, en Gironde, ils seront dotés de nouveaux équipements : combat air-sol et défense anti-guerre électronique.La formation des pilotes, et mécaniciens, ukrainiens se poursuit.&mdash; Sébastien Lecornu (@SebLecornu) October 8, 2024 As TWZ reported at the time, in June of this year French President Emmanuel Macron announced plans to transfer an undisclosed number of Mirage 2000-5 fighters to Ukraine, outlining 'a new cooperation' with manufacturer Dassault. When rumors of secondhand Mirage 2000s being provided to Ukraine first emerged, it was unclear if the aircraft in question were the more modern Mirage 2000-5F versions currently operated by that service, or the older Mirage 2000C variants, the last of which were retired in June 2022, as you can read about here. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (left) is welcomed by French Minister of Defense Sebastien Lecornu (right) upon his arrival at the Paris Orly airport, on February 8, 2023. Photo by JULIEN DE ROSA/POOL/AFP via Getty Images JULIEN DE ROSA While converted from Mirage 2000Cs, the Mirage 2000-5Fs are more capable, albeit also almost entirely restricted to air-to-air operations, at least in their basic form. Most importantly, the Mirage 2000-5F introduced the RDY radar, a mechanically scanned pulse-Doppler type with look-down/shoot-down capability. Compared to the RDM and RDI radar in the Mirage 2000C, the newer system can track more targets simultaneously — up to eight — and also has some air-to-ground functionality — which is likely critical for the enhancements planned for Ukraine. The new radar is combined with a much-modernized cockpit, including three multifunction color displays. The standard weapons for the air defense Mirage 2000-5F are from the MICA family of beyond-visual-range air-to-air missiles, with either radar-homing or infrared seeker heads. It’s unclear what air-to-ground munitions will be added after the upgrade work, but there are two very obvious options. First is the stealthy SCALP-EG cruise missile, which has been integrated on other Mirage 2000 versions and which is already used by Ukrainian Su-24 Fencer strike aircraft. Another option is the Hammer rocket-assisted precision-guided bomb. While the Hammer is not known to have been integrated on the Mirage 2000 previously, the French-made weapon is also used by Ukraine, with France having promised to deliver significant numbers. A French-supplied AASM-250 Hammer rocket-assisted precision-guided bomb under the wing of a Ukrainian MiG-29 Fulcrum. via X via X The new electronic self-defense equipment promised to Ukraine may well consist of the ICMS Mk 2 system which, includes radar warning receivers, jammers, and chaff and flare dispensers, all of which are mounted internally. This is found on export Mirage 2000-5s, but French Air Force jets use an older and less-capable system. Meanwhile, the definitive Mirage 2000-9 for export has the ICMS Mk 3, which is fully digital, and might also be an option for Ukraine. Its capabilities include prioritizing and then displaying to the pilot the eight highest-priority threats. The F-16s that have been delivered to Ukraine also sport a robust electronic warfare suite, which you can learn more about here and in the video below. While former French Air Force Mirage 2000-5Fs seem the most likely candidates to be delivered to Ukraine, Lecornu today only mentioned 'Mirage 2000s,' while Macron spoke of 'Mirage 2000-5s.' It’s possible that France has attempted to acquire Mirage 2000-5s from Greece, Qatar, or even Taiwan, the export operators of this version. Afterburner takeoff for a Greek Mirage 2000-5. Hellenic Air Force Afterburner take-off for a Hellenic Air Force Mirage 2000-5EG. Hellenic Air Force Greece recently announced plans to retire at least some of its Mirage 2000-5s, while the Qatari Mirage 2000-5 fleet has been retired for some time now and has been repeatedly connected with different customers, including contractor red air providers, although no firm orders have been placed. With a Mirage upgrade program underway and a huge requirement for air defense fighters, Taiwan is unlikely to want to offload any of its jets. Bearing in mind the current timeline, however, it seems likely that the aircraft will be drawn from French Air Force stocks, which will leave the service short of air defense fighters, at least until more Dassault Rafales are delivered. Currently, around 30 Mirage 2000-5Fs are based at Luxeuil in France, with a detachment in Djibouti on the Horn of Africa. A Mirage 2000-5F takes off from Luxeuil Air Base, in Saint-Sauveur, eastern France, on March 13, 2022. Photo by SEBASTIEN BOZON/AFP via Getty Images SEBASTIEN BOZON France might also have some additional Mirage 2000-5Fs in storage that it could send to Ukraine, or which it could use to backfill its own inventory. In all, 37 Mirage 2000Cs were updated to 2000-5F standard, although the fleet has been depleted through attrition. As to how soon Ukraine might be able to employ the Mirage in combat, this will depend primarily upon the progress of the pilots and mechanics now being trained on the aircraft. Reports in the French media state that the country has agreed to train an initial 26 Ukrainian pilots. Last month, the French Armed Forces announced that the first cohort of pilots had completed Alpha Jet training in France. Although it’s not clear if these aviators will progress to the F-16 or the Mirage, the latter now makes a lot of sense.

That is now starting to yield more results, however, with the recent announcement that the first F-16s supplied by the Netherlands have begun to reach that country, joining the initial aircraft delivered by Denmark. Previously, the Netherlands had delivered F-16s to the training center in Romania, where they are used for converting Ukrainian pilots. For the first time, I can officially announce that the first Dutch F-16s have been delivered to Ukraine.This is urgently needed.

Demonstrating the ability to operate two different Western-made fighters may also help pave the way to additional, and other types of NATO-standard combat aircraft making their way to Ukraine, too.

Chinese Laser Anti-Drone System Spotted In Iran	Iran looks to have fielded a Chinese laser directed energy weapon intended for 'dazzling' drones or even destroying them in certain circumstances, as well as other new counter-drone capabilities. The Iranian government has been central in the global proliferation of uncrewed aerial systems, including kamikaze drones, but also faces many of the same kinds of threats, especially from Israel. Pictures said to show a laser counter-drone system in the Iranian capital Tehran first emerged online last Friday. The system was reportedly deployed as part of security measures around a rare public sermon by Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. In his remarks, Khamenei defended Iran's recent ballistic missile barrage against Israel, lauded Hamas' terrorist attacks last year that have precipitated a growing regional conflict, and said that Iranian-backed proxies would continue fighting despite a series of targeted assassinations. Readers can find more detailed reporting about the current state of crises across the Middle East here. #Israel #Lebanon #Hezbollah#Iran #Nasrallah #Hamas During yesterday's Friday prayers in Tehran, the Chinese-made Silent Hunter laser system to deal with drones was seen for the first time in Iran The range of this system is up to 4 km depending on the target and the output… pic.twitter.com/MiY3VNgKoe&mdash; Koba (@Roberto05246129) October 5, 2024 Many observers have identified the laser counter-drone system seen in the recently emerged pictures as an example of China's Silent Hunter, but this appears to be incorrect. Known images of Silent Hunter, and mockups thereof, including examples in service in Saudi Arabia, show it has a turret with a single large circular aperture (likely its beam director) on the right side of a central mast. Silent Hunter's turret also has smaller circular apertures, which should include electro-optical and/or infrared cameras for target detection, tracking, and engagement on the right and left of the main mast. A picture of a truck-mounted Silent Hunter system, or mock-up thereof, on display. Chinese internet While the system said to have deployed last week in Tehran has a similar overall design, it has a single large aperture on the left side. In addition, there is an aperture with a more squared-off shape on the right side. The central mast has a different design, as well. A similar, if not identical arrangement is visible in Chinese marketing literature for another counter-drone laser weapon called the Shen Nung (also transliterated Shennong). Containerized and 4&#215;4 Dongfeng Mengshi light tactical truck-mounted versions of the Shen Nung – the Shen Nung 5000 and 3000, respectively – have at least been pitched in the past. The pictures reportedly taken in Tehran last week show the system behind a blue tarp screen, but what is visible could point to a containerized variant. A side-by-side comparison of the turret on a Saudi Arabian Silent Hunter laser counter-drone system (at left) and the one in the recently emerged pictures said to have been taken in Tehran last Friday (at right). Saudi Arabia Ministry of Defense/via X A Shen Nung promotional image showing containerized (Shen Nung 5000) and Dongfeng Mengshi-based (Shen Nung 3000) variants. Chinese internet Another view of the laser counter-drone system reportedly deployed in Tehran last week showing what may be parts of a containerized base. via X It's worth noting here that both Silent Hunter and the Shen Nung feature small radars on top of their respective turrets to help detect and track targets, something that is also visible on the system in the recently emerged pictures. A machine translation of Chinese-language specifications for the Shen Nung, seen below, says that it is capable of detecting drones up to 3.1 miles (five kilometers) away using its radar. The system's laser, stated to be in the 10 to 20-kilowatt power range, is said to be capable of launching non-destructive blinding or 'dazzling' attacks out to a range of nearly 2 miles (three kilometers) and of actually destroying certain targets that get within a mile (one and a half kilometers). The translation of the specification sheet also indicates that the laser can run for up to 200 seconds (just over three minutes) at a time, and needs 'less than' five minutes to charge up for an initial engagement and between 'shots.' This highlights some of the core pros and cons of laser directed energy weapons, which offer benefits especially when it comes to functionally unlimited 'magazine depth,' but also can only engage one target at once and can require some amount of time to recharge or to cool between firings. Chinese internet It's important to make clear here that even dazzling can be very effective against drones, including armed types, by blinding seekers and other optics, and thus disrupting their ability to find targets and prosecute attacks. At the same time, this is less useful against drones with more automated and/or multi-mode targeting capabilities. The War Zone recently explored the counter-drone capabilities that laser dazzlers do offer in detail in the context of options for defending tanks and other armored vehicles from uncrewed aerial threats in a feature you can find here. There is the possibility that the laser counter-drone system said to have been deployed last Friday in Tehran is something else, such as a locally-produced clone/derivative of a Chinese type or an ostensibly domestically-developed design. Many laser directed energy weapons in service and/or development globally, including ones produced in the United States, have broadly similar turret designs. However, this seems very unlikely given the similarities between what is seen in the images and of the Shen Nung. From what can be seen in on the recently emerged images, the laser system also looks to have been one of a number of counter-drone capabilities emplaced together. A large planar array system in particular looks very much like what we have seen for high power microwave system concepts, with their advantage being their wide beams can rapidly disrupt or destroy more drones faster than that of a laser. What may have been an electronic warfare jammer or remotely operated gun system is also visible. Additional radars and other sensors are also a possibility. Layering different systems together would help provide a broader breadth of coverage against different tiers of uncrewed aerial systems. Other systems seen near the apparent Shen Nung deployed in Tehran last week, including what may be a high-power microwave at right and either an electronic warfare jammer or remotely operated gun system at left. via X Regardless, it makes sense that Iran's security services would deploy various kinds of counter-drone and other defensive measures around Khamenei's appearance last week. Help in acquiring these capabilities and doing so rapidly, especially to help protect the Supreme Leader, would also be a very likely top ask from the Iranian government to its Chinese counterparts, with which it has a close relationship. As the Iranian Supreme Leader highlighted himself, Israel has shown a willingness and ability to kill hostile leadership figures, as well as other senior officials and even more rank-and-file terrorists, using a wide variety of highly targeted means in the past. This includes the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, then head of Hamas, in a guest house in Tehran, reportedly using a planted bomb, back in July, as you can read more about here. Israel has also long been a prolific user of various tiers of armed uncrewed aerial systems, including kamikaze types and ones capable of dropping small munitions, in targeted strikes.

This reality has now been fully thrust into the mainstream consciousness thanks to the war in Ukraine. In particular, highly maneuverable first-person view (FPV) kamikaze drones, which can be launched very close to their intended target or from miles away, and are very hard to defend against, are now readily accessible. Uncrewed aerial threats now look to be poised to rise to a new level with the proliferation of artificial intelligence-driven technologies, as you can read about more in this feature. This, in turn, has led to a new explosion of interest in counter-drone systems, including across the U.S. military, which has been working to develop and field various tiers of kinetic and non-kinetic capabilities. This includes laser and microwave directed energy weapons, as well as electronic warfare jammers, some of which have been deployed operationally in limited numbers in recent years. American officials have highlighted difficulties with laser systems specifically given their sensitivity to environmental factors, significant power requirements, thermal handling limitations, and other issues. There has also been a notable lag in the fielding of anti-drone capabilities by the U.S. armed forces and elsewhere within the U.S. government, despite the very real threats at play. This is now further underscored by Iran's apparent acquisition and deployment of a Chinese laser directed energy counter-drone system. The full extent of Tehran's current laser anti-drone capabilities are still unclear, but the emergence of a Shen Nung there makes good sense given the potential drone threats the country faces at a very tumultous time. It is also a sign of things to come and not just in Iran.

China’s Monster Amphibious Assault Ship Has Twin Island Superstru...	The first of China’s new class of big-deck amphibious assault ships is rapidly taking shape and we can now get a much better look at the vessel’s twin-island configuration. The design choice is typically made to simplify air operations and is very likely another indicator of this class of vessels being tailored, at least in part, for going to sea with enhanced air wings that include larger types of drones. A satellite view of the first of the Type 076 class vessels, with the twin island superstructures installed, on September 27, 2024. PHOTO © 2024 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION. Recent photos of the first of the Type 076 landing helicopter dock (LHD) ships — known in the West as the Yulan class — under construction at the yard on Changxing Island in Shanghai first reveal one island superstructure added to the deck, as of September 26, followed by another, installed as of September 28. According to these images, the first of the two island superstructures have been installed onboard the 076 LHD/LAH.

Previously, this kind of design has been chosen for the significantly larger British Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers, and there are suggestions that it might also be chosen for India’s future aircraft carrier Vishal. Closer in size to the Type 076 is the Italian Trieste, another LHD, which also has two islands. The Italian Navy's Trieste LPH moored at the fitting-out quay of Fincantieri's Castellammare di Stabia shipyard in 2020. Ivan Guida/Wikimedia Commons Notably, the twin-island configuration was chosen for these vessels since it makes aircraft operations more straightforward. With indications that the Type 076 will be heavily geared toward generating airpower — including in the form of heavier fixed-wing drones — this kind of design is especially relevant.

Crown Copyright The Royal Navy's new aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth will arrive in Gibraltar today for her first overseas port visit. Image by Dave Jenkins via Wikimedia Commons, CC-BY-2.0 Simply put, having two islands means that one can be dedicated to navigation and other primarily ship-related taskings, while the other is used exclusively for controlling flight operations. When it comes to drones, the additional demands in terms of moving them around the deck remotely may also have helped reach this design decision. As well as the twin islands, the Type 076 has other features that suggest the primacy of air operations in its mission spectrum. Already obvious in previous imagery is the very large open flight deck, substantially wider than on other amphibious assault ships. There is also all but certain that a catapult is installed on the ship's bow, which will likely be complemented by arresting gear to accommodate, in particular, stealthy uncrewed combat air vehicles (UCAV) and other larger fixed-wing drones. Latest update on the first Type 076 LHD and now it is clear there is indeed only a single EMALS catapult. (Image via Ricky Un on Facebook) pic.twitter.com/TV4E8udqCn&mdash; @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) June 9, 2024 Also speaking to the increased emphasis on air operations is the apparent space for an aircraft elevator on the port side of the stern end. This would be in addition to another large elevator at the center of the stern, as found on the Type 075. One of China’s Type 075 amphibious assault ships. via Chinese internet www.twz.com So far, there is no sign of a ‘ski jump’ takeoff ramp, though this could be potentially added in the future. However, it may be the case that the catapult — expected to be an electromagnetic aircraft launch system (EMALS) — would be sufficient for launching fixed-wing aircraft at higher operating weights. Using EMALS also has particular benefits for drone operations, these systems being better suited to launching smaller and lighter aircraft. As expected, the Type 076 is therefore shaping up to be much more than a traditional amphibious assault ship, which also makes sense given its overall size: falling roughly between China’s current largest amphibious warship, the Type 075, and the country’s newest and largest aircraft carrier, the Fujian. Based on previous TWZ analysis of satellite imagery, the Type 076 is roughly 864 feet long and 141 feet wide (263 and nearly 43 meters, respectively). By comparison, again based on satellite imagery, the Type 075 is 784 feet long and 105 feet wide (almost 239 and 32 meters), while the Fujian is 1,036 feet in length and 275 feet in width (close to 316 and almost 84 meters).

PHOTO © 2024 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION While it's still the case that the Type 076 appears to be primarily intended to operate rotary-winged aircraft, like a more traditional amphibious assault ship, all signs currently point to drones being a major part of its air wing, too. Once again, the twin-island configuration should help make the integration of both crewed and uncrewed aircraft simpler. There are other signs pointing to this, as well. As we explored back in June, apparent mockups of China’s stealthy GJ-11 Sharp Sword UCAV have emerged at a test and/or training site on Changxing Island, a little over a mile from where the first Type 076 is being built. The facility includes a large apron and structures that may be intended to reflect the island or islands on a carrier or assault ship. Apparent mockups of China’s stealthy GJ-11 UCAV on Changxing Island in Shanghai. Google Earth This adds to the weight of evidence suggesting that the GJ-11, or a related development, is set to be part of future air wings for the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s carriers and its more modern big-deck amphibious assault ships. Provided the Type 076 class does eventually embark GJ-11s or similar drones, these might be used primarily for maritime strike and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). But as we have discussed in the past, there are many other potential mission sets, including electronic warfare systems, carrying directed-energy weapons, launching decoys, as well as more generally extending the targeting capabilities of friendly forces. Providing targeting data to anti-ship ballistic missiles, long-range anti-ship cruise missiles, as well as crewed strike aircraft, would be particularly relevant for the PLAN.

We likely won’t have to wait long before more details of this fascinating — and very impressive — design begin to emerge, including a better idea of what kinds of aircraft, crewed or otherwise, it might operate.

Russia’s S-70 Hunter Drone Was Armed When Shot Down By Friendly F...	Photos of the wreckage of the Russian S-70 Okhotnik-B (Hunter-B) flying wing unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) that was shot down by a Russian fighter in a mysterious incident over Ukraine last weekend reveal that it was carrying at least one precision-guided glide bomb. This would appear to confirm that the drone was engaged in some kind of operational trials, including prosecuting Ukrainian targets, perhaps also specifically to establish how the S-70 performs in a contested environment. You can read our original reporting of the drone shootdown here, suffice it to say that the S-70 — possibly the fourth prototype — was brought down by a Russian fighter of unconfirmed type, which fired a short-range air-to-air missile. Video posted to social media showed the burning drone spiraling to the ground. The engagement occurred near Konstantynivka, in Donetsk, reportedly around 10 miles behind Ukrainian lines.

Not included in the above series of photos, taken by a Getty Images photographer, is the fairly intact portion of one of the wings of the drone, which was seen soon after it came down. It was likely rapidly transported elsewhere for further analysis. via X Russian S-70 UAV, which was shot down today - Ai upscaled 150% + dehalo + compression reverse + 30 to 60 FPS + Stabilization pic.twitter.com/JaVAITto5C&mdash; Dariusz Zawadzki (@Military_oO) October 5, 2024 Among the twisted and burnt remains of the drone, the nose cone from at least one example of the UMPB D-30SN winged precision-guided bomb can be clearly made out. This is a weapon we have examined in depth in the past, but it wasn’t previously known to be part of the S-70’s armory. The weapon is a much more refined glide bomb compared to the previous UMPK, a fairly crude type of weapon that nonetheless has caused considerable difficulties for Ukrainian air defenses since its introduction in around early 2023. One of the first examples of the UMPB D-30SN to be seen in detail, in a photo that emerged in March of this year. via X First appearing in the spring of this year, the UMPB D-30SN is closer in concept to the U.S.-made GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb, reportedly using inertial and satellite navigation, although it’s unclear if the weapon can be programmed with a target’s coordinates after the aircraft has taken off, which would be required for the most time-sensitive targets. The range of the weapon is unknown, but it’s likely greater than that of the UMPK. That earlier weapon has been unofficially attributed with a range of 44 miles, although there are several reports that assert that the actual range is much smaller. The S-70 is designed with some low observable (stealthy) features, including internal weapons carriage. Russia has developed a number of compressed-carriage missiles that are suitable for the internal weapons bays of the S-70, as well as the crewed Su-57 Felon fighter. Few details have been released so far concerning the particular types of weapons that the S-70 can or will carry, although there have been official statements in the past describing trials involving air-to-air missiles. On the other hand, for a drone of this class, air-to-ground munitions (as well as reconnaissance payloads) would seem more operationally realistic, at least at this stage of its development. A front view of an S-70 taxiing after landing. Russian Ministry of Defense The UMPB D-30SN is a comparatively new weapon, likely developed in response to the demands of the war in Ukraine — specifically, the need for lower-cost standoff weapons with precision guidance. The fact that the S-70 was loaded with at least one of these weapons also points to the likelihood that it was being used for some kind of operational trials. The S-70 should have enough range to operate from its home base in the vicinity of the Ukrainian border, after which it could have strayed across unintentionally. But running non-combat trials of a drone loaded with weapons on Russian territory so close to the Ukrainian border seems highly unlikely. If an armed Russian drone was operating over the Ukrainian front lines, it was almost certainly intentional. An S-70 drone flies accompanied by a Su-57. Russian Ministry of Defense www.twz.com There remains a small possibility that the glide bomb could have been lobbed at the location where the drone came down to ensure that the remains of the S-70 were destroyed, although there are no reports of such airstrikes in the vicinity. Russia’s slow targeting cycles would also seem to rule that out, especially bearing in mind the question of whether the UMPB D-30SN can even have target coordinates uploaded while in flight. Meanwhile, there have been unconfirmed reports that Russia targeted the crash site with an Iskander short-range ballistic missile, which seems much more likely — and is something TWZ predicted. We still don’t know why the drone was shot down by another Russian aircraft, but the fact that it was operating in close proximity to a crewed jet suggests it may also have been conducting some kind of trials in which it was paired with a crewed platform. The S-70 has been involved in previous non-combat ‘loyal wingman’ trials alongside the Su-57. This may also have led to the claims that it was a Su-57 that shot down the example over Ukraine. On the other hand, the S-70 may have been exploring independent strike operations, with a fighter on hand to observe or even specifically to shoot it down in the case of a serious malfunction, including a terminal command loss. Above all, the need to potentially shoot it down may have been driven by the requirement to keep sensitive technology out of Ukrainian (and, by proxy, Western) hands. We go over these possibilities and their historical precedent in detail in our past report on the incident. CONFIRMED: Russian 'Hunter' Sukhoi S-70 Okhotnik-B UCAV was shot down by Russian Su-57 fighter jet with AA missile.Why?No answer, for now. pic.twitter.com/foCGeO5igZ&mdash; Clash Report (@clashreport) October 5, 2024 Whatever the operational status of the S-70 shot down over the weekend, the capabilities that the drone offers in the strike role would be of great interest to the Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS). Throughout the war, the VKS crewed aircraft fleet has taken heavy losses, while Ukraine’s expanding air defense capabilities have pushed tactical aircraft further away from the front lines. This situation has spurred the development and fielding of weapons like the UMPB D-30SN. Adding these munitions to an uncrewed platform with a useful range that also offers at least some low-observable characteristics is certainly one way of mitigating those threats. Photos of new Russian UMPB D-30SN guided bombs installed under the wing of a Sukhoi Su-34 bomber. pic.twitter.com/sTskwkh1hF&mdash; Status-6 (Military & Conflict News) (@Archer83Able) May 23, 2024 However, it’s unclear how many S-70s are actually available to Russia. It seems that around four of the basic versions were completed, one of these being the victim of the shootdown, while a more refined S-70, with stealthier engine exhaust and other enhancements, has also been rolled out. Its current status is unclear. Whatever the case, the use of the S-70 in the war in Ukraine is likely to be tokenistic at best although — at least until the shootdown — its deployment there may have provided some useful test data for further development of the drone and related tactics. At the same time, the VKS needs all the strike assets it can get, which may also have prompted combat trials of the S-70, something that Russia has done before in the past, notably with the Su-57 in Syria and, according to Western intelligence assessments, in Ukraine. While an operational test of the S-70 and its strike capabilities in a combat environment now looks like the most likely explanation for the drone’s presence over Ukraine, it does remain somewhat surprising. Exposing the low-observable drone to such a high-threat environment is one thing, but putting a crewed fighter in the same area is another, all the more so if it was one of the relatively small number of Su-57s available to the VKS. Both platforms are among the most advanced and most sensitive in terms of technology, so risking them both is unusual. Perhaps the S-70 went astray, and the decision was taken to send a fighter to bring it down, with a short-range missile being used from within visual range to ensure that it was destroyed. Whatever happened, it’s certainly highly intriguing that an armed S-70 drone was underway over Ukraine. As well as being a very notable development in terms of the air war there, it may very well be the first known instance of an armed flying wing UCAV operating in an active conflict zone.

Israel Expands Ground Operation In Lebanon As World Braces For Re...	Israeli forces look to have conducted yet another targeted strike against Hezbollah in Lebanon's capital Beirut and have expanded their ground incursions in the southern end of that country. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) also say they shot down a ballistic missile headed toward the center of the country today, which Houthi militants in Yemen had fired. This all comes as Israel marks the first anniversary of Hamas' large-scale terrorist attacks last year, which touched off what the country's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has now described as a 'war of resurrection' (or 'rebirth' or 'revival' depending on the translation). There continue to be fears of an even broader regional conflict depending on how Israel responds to Iran's ballistic missile barrage last week. What specific type of missile the Houthis fired at Israel today is unclear, but it was reportedly downed outside the atmosphere by an Arrow-3 interceptor. Concerns about debris from the engagement posing a risk to bystanders on the ground caused air raid sirens to blare across a broad area of central Israel. The incoming missile also looks to have temporarily disrupted commercial air traffic at Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv, though it is unknown currently if that was the intended target. The Yemeni militants targeted Tel Aviv for the first time in September. The missile was shot down with the Arrow long-range missile defense system, which is designed to take out ballistic missiles while they are still outside the atmosphere.&mdash; Emanuel (Mannie) Fabian (@manniefabian) October 7, 2024 Sirens sounding all over central Israel as a result of a missile from Yemen pic.twitter.com/suvOJmzNta&mdash; Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) October 7, 2024 Arriving and Departing Flights at Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv have been Suspended, following the launch of a Ballistic Missile from Yemen towards Central Israel.

The IDF often issues public warnings for civilians to evacuate certain areas ahead of more general strikes and other operations. Reports also say that the particular area of Beirut that was hit was where Hashem Safieddine, second-in-command of Hezbollah, was targeted and possibly killed last week. Israel has been very actively targeting the leadership of the Lebanese terrorist group, as well as its weapons stockpiles and communications networks, for weeks now. A particularly huge Israeli strike on Beirut on September 27 killed Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's long-time leader, among others. Hezbollah's number two Safieddine was widely seen as Nasrallah's likely successor. Just this past weekend, Israel launched additional strikes on the Lebanese capital said to target Hezbollah weapon storage facilities, which caused an especially massive blast with numerous secondary explosions.

Elements of three brigades assigned to the 91st 'Galilee' Division – the 3rd 'Alexandroni,' the 8th 'Hativa Shmoneh,' and the 228th 'Alon' – have now moved into Lebanon. The 91st Division has long been tasked with guarding Israel's northern border with Lebanon and its 769th 'Hiram' Brigade' remains in Israel to continue that mission. The 91st is the third Israeli division to send forces into Lebanese territory since ground operations as part of the current campaign began on September 30-October 1.

Last week, the IDF issued new evacuation warnings to Lebanese civilians in communities north of an existing United Nations-monitored buffer zone that pointed to a widening operations area. As already noted, all of these developments come as Israel has now marked the one-year anniversary of Hamas' unprecedented attacks on October 7, 2023, which have precipitated the current regional conflagration. Hamas launched a new round of rocket attacks on Israel today that coincided with the exact time it launched its operation a year ago.

All of these groups are backed by Iran, which has itself launched two barrages against Israeli sites. Israel continues to conduct operations targeting Hamas and other Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, and has also launched its own strikes on targets in Yemen and Iran.

The War Zone and others have noted in the past that escalating Iranian strikes could lead Israel to target the former's oil or nuclear infrastructure, which in turn could provoke even stronger reactions from Tehran. Satellite imagery and ship tracking data have shown a recent exodus of Iranian tanker ships from Kharg Island, which handles the bulk of the country's oil exports, ahead of potential Israeli strikes there. Satellite imagery also points to the departure of a significant number of Iranian warships from the port of Bandar Abbas.

Just yesterday, Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi, head of Iran's Army, warned of 'stronger and more destructive' attacks if Israel responded in kind to the latest volley of Iranian missiles. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu had said that 'Iran made a big mistake tonight – and it will pay for it' after the missile barrage last week. There continue to be concerns about how further fighting directly between Israel and Iran might draw in other actors, especially the United States. The U.S. military has already been actively engaged in defending Israel against attacks from Iran. U.S. Army Gen. Michael 'Erik' Kurilla, head of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), notably met with his Israeli counterparts in person yesterday.

Israeli media has reported today that the Biden administration has offered its Israeli counterparts a 'compensation package' that includes additional military aid to abstain from major retaliation against Iran. 'Far too many civilians have suffered far too much during this year of conflict — and tens of thousands have been killed, a human toll made far worse by terrorists hiding and operating among innocent people. We will not stop working to achieve a ceasefire deal in Gaza that brings the hostages home, allows for a surge in humanitarian aid to ease the suffering on the ground, assures Israel’s security, and ends this war,' Biden said in a statement marking the October 7 attacks. 'Israelis and Palestinians alike deserve to live in security, dignity, and peace. We also continue to believe that a diplomatic solution across the Israel-Lebanon border region is the only path to restore lasting calm and allow residents on both sides to return safely to their homes.' 'Israel will respond to the unprecedented Iranian attack in the manner of our choosing, and at the time and place of our choosing' and 'everything is on the table,' Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant also said on Sunday. '[But] we are powerful when we are aligned, and I want to make sure of it.' If nothing else, after more than a year of expanding fighting between Israeli forces and various militant groups around the region, as well as Iran itself, what Prime Minister Netanyahu has now dubbed the 'war of resurrection' shows no signs of slowing down.

Why Did Russia Just Shoot Down Its Own Fighter-Sized S-70 Hunter ...	A bizarre situation emerged out of Eastern Ukraine this morning, one in which a Russian fighter fired a short-range air-to-air missile and shot down one of its own aircraft while flying over highly-defended Ukrainian territory. And this wasn't just any aircraft, it was one of a tiny handful of Russian Air Force S-70 Okhotnik-B (Hunter-B) flying wing unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV). Russian S-70 UAV, which was shot down today [The photos has been cleaned by artificial intelligence] pic.twitter.com/banwvy8oLy&mdash; Dariusz Zawadzki (@Military_oO) October 5, 2024 I can confirm, based on footage from @PEnssle, that Ukrainian forces have already recovered and removed large, relatively intact pieces of the advanced Russian S-70 Okhotnik UCAV that crashed in Donetsk Oblast.Notably including the wing segment seen in this video. pic.twitter.com/7Z9yDgKfab&mdash; OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) October 5, 2024 It's S-70-4 pic.twitter.com/9qVD3gUOGl&mdash; Fighterman_FFRC (@Fighterman_FFRC) October 5, 2024 CONFIRMED: Russian 'Hunter' Sukhoi S-70 Okhotnik-B UCAV was shot down by Russian Su-57 fighter jet with AA missile.Why?No answer, for now. pic.twitter.com/foCGeO5igZ&mdash; Clash Report (@clashreport) October 5, 2024 The S-70 is a heavy-weight strike and reconnaissance tactical drone with some low observable (stealthy) features. It was also envisioned to be able to partake in air-to-air combat. Independent operations and those paired with other aircraft, both manned and unmanned, are envisioned for the type. The S-70 is a very large UCAV design. Here we see the first generation example with its exposed exhaust, of which only around four were said to have been built. A more advanced type was subsequently rolled out with a more refined airframe and enhanced stealthy features, but the status of this variant is unknown. The engagement occurred near Konstantynivka, in Donetsk, supposedly around 10 miles behind Ukrainian lines. Video shot from the ground shows one jet firing on another at close range, then a shattered flying wing aircraft falling to the ground. Images and video of the wreckage make it undeniable, it was indeed an S-70. Although we cannot say conclusively at this time, it appears to be one of the earlier demonstrator aircraft, which first emerged in early 2019, or one built to a similar specification and is significantly lower in sophistication than a more refined variant with enhanced low-observable (stealth) features rolled out in 2021. A more refined S-70 was rolled out in 2021, including a low-observable exhaust. (UAC) Some claim an Su-57 Felon shot the aircraft down. We cannot confirm that at this time, but that would make sense as the two programs have been directly linked and 'loyal wingmen' cooperative testing — even if rudimentary — between the two was underway long before the full-on invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Prior to the invasion, Russia claimed it was targeting the Hunter-B to be operational by 2024. What exactly the definition of operational was isn't known. While it isn't perfectly clear what transpired to cause one Russian aircraft to shoot down another, the most likely answer is that the S-70 was being used operationally as part of its ongoing development — which likely has slowed considerably since the war began — and especially to provide support for the war effort. Russia often sends its new gear into combat areas for testing and to drum-up support for potential export opportunities. The Russian Air Force has taken heavy losses and is under threat from long-range air defenses while in the air and from marauding Ukrainian drones while on the ground. Even if the S-70 program has slowed, pushing existing examples into combat use would make sense as one thing it offers above all else is range and the lack of a pilot onboard certainly makes it less risky when operating near the front. Its low-observable features could make it less susceptible to air defenses, but to what degree is highly debatable. It's also possible that it was never supposed to get near Ukrainian airspace along the front at all. So, why shoot it down? The best answer is that operators lost command over the aircraft and it had strayed into airspace over hostile territory. Systems failures can occur and we are talking about a very dense electronic warfare combat environment here. This is not an uncommon reality for testing new advanced aerial unmanned technologies or even for operations of existing types in both hostile and benign areas. Self-destruct devices or more often fighter aircraft prepared to shoot the drone down in case it poses a danger to others or a security risk is a normal contingency. The U.S. had to do this multiple times when its drones went astray during the Global War On Terror, for instance. A very sensitive drone like the S-70 lost deep inside Ukrainian territory, coming down possibly in a semi-intact state, would be a huge problem for Russia, both technologically and optics-wise, so it seems the decision was made to destroy it. We can all remember when the U.S. lost its far more secretive RQ-170 to Iran in 2011, for example. The approximate area where the S-70 went down. (Google Earth) The fact that this occurred over Ukrainian-held territory is also surprising. First off, the air defense overlay over this region is extremely robust and a huge threat to anything that flies close to the front, especially at altitude. It's somewhat bewildering that the S-70 and the fighter survived long enough to execute the shootdown in this area. Maybe it's a testament to their designs and Russia's electronic warfare capabilities or maybe they just got very lucky, we just don't know. The risk was clearly worth taking in Russia's eyes though. Working closer to the front with an Su-57 would make some sense as they are more capable of doing it than anything in Russia's inventory, but it also speaks to some stunning risk Russia is able to absorb in order to put these aircraft into action. Beyond kinetic actions, considering Russia's limited advanced reconnaissance capabilities in contested areas, the ability to collect airborne intelligence that close to the front using advanced sensors alone could have been seen as worth the gamble. Once again, it's also possible they were never meant to be close to the front lines and the decision to take the S-70 down came late or the Su-57 raced in to do it and was operating well behind the S-70 to begin with. Regardless, it was very risky. Having large parts of an Su-57 fall into the hands of Western intelligence would be a big deal. But still, the S-70's wreckage may represent the most enticing foreign material exploitation (FME) opportunity of the conflict, and there have been many of them so far. It also makes sense why large parts would be spirted away as fast as possible as because if Russia could geolocate the wreckage, they would surely try to strike it, likely with an Islander-M ballistic missile in order to eliminate it as fast as possible. But unless a lower-end drone spots it and minus a few other caveats, Russia's targeting cycles are notoriously slow. Notably not present in this footage, filmed just a few hours after the crash. OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) October 5, 2024 Since not long after the invasion began, there has been chatter about the Su-57 and the S-70 — both of which exist in small numbers — being used on a limited basis. It's hard to parse which of these reports are accurate and which are not, but some of them have been backed up by Western intelligence. This incident clearly shows Russia's willingness to thrust these prized assets into the war effort, or at least close enough to these activities where contingencies like this one would be put in place and executed upon demand. The S-70 aircraft largely call Akhtubinsk Air Base home. This is Russia's key tactical jet flight test facility and an airfield that has been on the receiving end of Ukrainian drone strikes. It isn't clear if the S-70 flew from this location or was forward-based for Ukraine operations, but the base being about 365 miles from the fighting would put it well inside the drone's presumed combat radius. Still, it's worth noting that high-resolution satellite imagery taken of the installation multiple times in the second half of September does not show the S-70 aircraft on the ramp. This could be because they are hangared or they are forward deployed. A pair of S-70s sit on the ramp at Russia's 929th Chkalov State Flight Test Center in 2022. (Google Earth) As for what the Russian milbloggers are saying about this incident, many are fuming that these aircraft were in such a densely defended area. Others confirm that the S-70 was shot down due to a failure in its command and control architecture while on a combat evaluation. Fighterbomber, which is well connected to the Russian Air Force, states: 'It is clear that the GLIC will now be spanked in all its cracks. They basically fucked up a serial Okhotnik. (This is indicated by its coloring, only standard UAVs are painted like this) At the same time, it is difficult to understand what happened to the UAV, because it fell on territory controlled by the hohols. That is, they will disassemble it down to the last screw and, of course, familiarize themselves with its rich internal contents. Secondly, in fact, both the Okhotnik and the escort fighter were flying over enemy territory. At a high altitude, shot through and accessible to all air defense systems, including MANPADS. That is, we could have fucked up not only the Okhotnik, but also the Su-57 escort, and this is a completely different scenario. I understand that even the loss of a pair of A-50s did not entail any serious organizational conclusions, maybe we would have bounced back here, but it would be more difficult. And I really want to hope that it was a loss of control due to something failing, or they didn't resolve the situation with the Rabbits, or the UAV's brains went crazy for their own reasons, and not the drone being intercepted by the enemy. But the event, of course, requires the most thorough investigation.' Above all else, it is quite ironic that the first known instance that a flying wing multi-role unmanned combat air vehicle was shot down in an active conflict zone was not at the hands of the enemy, but by those belonging to its own air force. We will update this post with new information throughout the day if new info comes to light.

Ukraine Now Using Dragon Drones To Burn Russian Bunkers, Tanks	Ukraine is finding new ways to use its thermite-spewing dragon drones to burn Russian forces. They are now attacking their bunkers and tanks. The first use of these weapons, as we previously reported, became public back in early September. That's when video emerged showing one dispersing the molten mixture into trellises that concealed Russian troops and equipment. Additional videos soon popped up on social media showing more Ukrainian units using the weapon that way. Russia is also trying to use similar systems, but to what extent remains unclear. Primarily used in grenades and artillery shells, among other applications, thermite is a combination of oxidized iron and aluminum that burns at about 4,440 degrees Fahrenheit. The compound can be dropped or sprayed in a manner similar to a flamethrower. The combination of the searing heat of the thermite and the maneuverability and speed of a drone makes this a very lethal and versatile weapon. We are now seeing it applied elsewhere on the battlefield Ukrainian thermite dropping drones continue to rapidly proliferate through various drone units. Seen here, a Ukrainian drone from the 60th Mechanized Brigade drops a stream of molten thermite on a Russian-held treeline. pic.twitter.com/o20diLuN1L&mdash; OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) September 4, 2024 At first, the drones were being deployed to burn away the areas where Russians sought cover under the dense growth. Now Ukraine has expanded its target list. In the video below, one of those drones sprayed the incendiary compound into a Russian bunker. It quickly spread, causing the bunker to erupt in flames, likely incinerating anyone inside. The AFU has started using the 'Dracarys' thermite drones to take out Russian bunkers.

Burning alive in a bunker filled with the horrific compound is also one heck of a psychological deterrent as well as being brutally effective. The Latest On the battlefield, Donetsk Oblast in eastern Ukraine continues to see the bulk of the fighting, but clashes continue across much of the 600-mile front lines as well as inside Russia’s Kursk Oblast. Kursk Oblast: Ukrainian forces continued ground assaults in Glushkovsky Raion west of the main Ukrainian salient there on October 4 but did not make confirmed advances, according to the latest assessment from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). Kharkiv Oblast: Russian forces recently marginally advanced in Vovchansk amid continued offensive operations north and northeast of Kharkiv City on October 4, ISW reported. Luhansk: Russian forces recently made a confirmed advance near Kreminna, according to ISW, amid continued offensive operations along the Kupyansk-Svatove-Kreminna line on October 4. Donetsk: Russian forces continued offensive operations east of Siversk near Verkhnokamyanske, southeast of Siversk near Spirne, near Chasiv Yar, Pokrovsk and southwest of Donetsk City with no confirmed gains, according to ISW. They recently advanced south of Toretsk and west of Donetsk City. Zaporizhzhia Oblast: Positional fighting 'continued in western Zaporizhia Oblast near Robotyne, Mali Shcherbaky (northwest of Robotyne), Kamyanske (south of Stepnohirsk), and Novodanylivka (north of Robotyne) on October 3 and 4, but there were no confirmed changes to the frontline,' the ISW assessment explained.

One soldier from Ukraine’s 72nd Brigade that defended the city explained why it couldn’t be held despite its elevation. 'And what is a dominant height now, if the enemy’s reconnaissance drones are hovering over you around the clock?' a soldier named Viktor told the Ukrainian Slidstvo news outlet. 'And they have an advantage in artillery, we had practically no artillery, it’s not like it was in the winter of 2023, when we defeated the 155th Brigade.' At that time, 'We had a lot of artillery, shoot if you want, but now we don’t, they have parity in the air due to the larger number of FPV drones,' he added. 'The Russians also started remotely mining all the access roads to the front line. Yes, their infantry are bums, but they have an advantage in means and numbers. We simply had no one and nothing to fight with.’' '‘Before the brigade was redeployed to the Donetsk region, we had a fully operational unit and staff. But over two years of fighting without rotations and rest, we turned into an incapacitated unit, the brigade was wiped out,’ says Viktor, who holds a position at the headquarters… pic.twitter.com/Y3w64BXlfj&mdash; Rob Lee (@RALee85) October 3, 2024 Now that Russia has the town, the question remains how much will it hurt Ukraine's defense. In addition to sitting on high ground, Vuhledar is also located on a highway and near the juncture of two fronts - Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia. Behind it lay open fields with little cover for Ukrainian troops to hide, making it easier for Russians to maneuver. In addition, it is located about 30 miles south of the embattled city of Pokrovsk, which as we have previously reported is a key logistical hub for Ukraine. The Russians however have been making few major territorial gains in the region. Adding to their challenges is that the mud season is not far away, which will make further gains even tougher to achieve. Overall, as ISW and other military analysts note, Russia's offensive momentum in Donbas is extremely slow and its unclear how much it can gain beyond VuhledarBut the picture in Donetsk is clearly much more dim than Ukraine would like to see&mdash; Samuel Ramani (@SamRamani2) October 4, 2024 Ukrainian drones struck the Borisoglebsk Air Base in Russia's Voronezh region, about 180 miles northeast of the border on Thursday.

Those officers 'came to the front as part of an exchange of experience,' the Kremlin Snuffbox Telegram channel claimed. 'They showed friendly military how our fighters prepare for assault actions, for defense, how we resist American weapons,' Kremlin Snuffbox explained, citing sources in the Russian Defense Ministry. 'Unfortunately, there was a missile strike on the training ground. In total, more than 20 people died, six of them are our friends - officers from North Korea.' Another three North Korean officers were wounded and sent to Moscow for treatment, the Telegram channel noted. As we wrote about in June, a mutual aid pact between Pyongyang and Moscow called for North Korea to send construction and engineering forces to Russia-occupied territories of Ukraine for rebuilding work. Kremlin Snuff Box said it asked if the presence of those North Koreans in Donetsk meant that its troops were taking part in the war. 'The sources did not give a clear answer to this question,' the Telegram channel stated.

Clearer Picture Of Damage To Israeli Airbase From Iranian Ballist...	Satellite images of Israel’s Nevatim Air Base reveal details of the level of destruction Iran achieved in its ballistic missile barrage on October 1 but also fail to provide any evidence to back up claims from Tehran about the destruction of Israeli Air Force F-35I Adir stealth fighters. You can read our initial report of the Iranian attacks here, as well as an account of how the U.S. Navy helped defeat some of the incoming missiles here. Of the around 180 ballistic missiles — including ones of notably advanced design — launched by Iran earlier this week, a significant number landed in Israel, succeeding in overwhelming the country’s extensive anti-ballistic missile umbrella. This is in contrast to the Iranian attacks in April, during which only very few missiles — mainly of older design — managed to leak through. In that attack, long-range one-way attack drones were also layered into the attack. This time it was strictly a ballistic missile affair, which makes sense considering the poor performance of the drones. Iran claimed that the missiles in the latest attack were directed at key Israeli military facilities including the Mossad headquarters, air defense radars, and two key air bases: Nevatim and Tel Nof. This is exactly the target set we posited would be chosen for such an attack. Geolocation confirms that Iranian hits pounded the Nevatim airbase.Reviewing the footage, you can see slower projectiles mixed in with the supersonic ones, with the supersonic projectiles hitting the important targets.@warcabinet_ pic.twitter.com/aRmomVtijb&mdash; Theurgy (@eTheurgy) October 2, 2024 Nevatim Air Base has been very prominent in terms of Iranian claims of success, while subsequent satellite imagery sheds light on what actually happened there. So far, equivalent imagery from Tel Nof Air Base has not become available. Partial cloud cover has limited the output of high-resolution imagery since the strike. Israel has claimed that its air operations were not impacted by the strikes. In the meantime, open-source intelligence and imagery analysts have been poring over the satellite images of Nevatim, which houses the IAF prized F-35 fleet and electronic support aircraft, as well as airlifters and other aircraft. According to Decker Eveleth, a strategic forces analyst at the Center for Naval Analyses (CAN), a U.S. nonprofit research and analysis organization, these reveal 'at least 33 likely impact craters, with likely more impacts currently obscured by clouds.' The total number of impacts is therefore probably closer to 40, Eveleth contends. Make sure to read Everett's full analysis here. We counted! 32 impact points at Nevatim, with a small degree of clustering. They landed multiple hits in the area of F-35 hangers, with one possible direct hit, but not a lot of damage. Takeaway: some F-35s got really lucky. Decker Eveleth (@dex_eve) October 3, 2024 This is a significant number and especially notable when compared with Iran’s attacks in April, which succeeded in only five confirmed missile impacts at Nevatim. What’s not entirely clear is what exactly Iran was targeting at Nevatim Air Base and whether the warheads that impacted there were intended to hit specific hangars, buildings, or other particular points and failed to do so. Eveleth does note some impact ‘clustering’ around areas including revetments and fighter hangars, though this isn’t conclusive. Still, one hangar was clearly destroyed.

Striking precisely over much greater distances with more complex missiles is certainly a tougher proposition though. In his analysis of what the latest missile barrage against Nevatim Air Base actually achieved, Eveleth concludes that the answer is 'not much.' 'Most of the impact zones either missed entirely or simply hit the taxiways around the base, most of which has now been repaired. They did score some hits on one refueling aircraft hangar and a couple buildings,' he continues. A support building at the southern end of the base certainly was hit, destroying a part of it, while another building on the eastern side of the base was also hit, and shows signs of likely heavy damage. There is also a closely grouped number of impacts around an aircraft storage area, although these aircraft are parked in the open, suggesting they may be no longer active. As for the highly prized F-35s — 20 of which were destroyed, according to some Iranian reports — the damage here seems to be largely limited to some craters adjacent to a row of shelters that house the aircraft, although its possible limited damage to concealed airframes did occur. Israeli Air Force F-35I Adir stealth fighters. IAF Israeli F-35I Adirs. Israeli Air Force One of the shelters seems to have received some damage, perhaps due to a direct hit, with suggestions of a small hole in the roof. It’s unclear what happened here, but Eveleth suggests it may have been a warhead that failed to explode. Even if more warheads had hit the shelters and detonated, there’s a high probability the majority of the F-35s would have survived anyway, since they were almost certainly airborne in advance of the missile attack. On the evening of the strikes, almost all Israeli Air Force tankers were airborne off the coast, suggesting they were involved in topping up combat aircraft that had scrambled from their bases. F-35s would have been prioritized assets for tanker support in order to save them from potential destruction on the ground. Of all the aircraft Iran would target, they would be at the top of the list as they pose the most threat to the regime and are highly prized by the IAF. ISRAEL - Almost the whole israeli tanker fleet is in the sky. pic.twitter.com/8OGsl0GDD1&mdash; kim høvik (@kimhvik2) October 1, 2024 How much of the IAF did they get airborne before the ballistic missiles arrived? We likely saw a plan put into action here based on lessons learned from the last barrage.&mdash; Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) October 1, 2024 Still, some are claiming that all of the F-35s would have vacated the base before the missiles arrived. This is nearly an impossible notion. All fighter aircraft, and especially highly complex 5th generation types, take a vast amount of constant maintenance. A portion of the fleet would be down for deep servicing, waiting on parts, and other issues at any given time, making it impossible for them to fly out. You can read our in-depth article on this reality here. Still, some grounded jets could still be moved to unlikely locations around the base in many instances to help protect them if there was time to do so. Looking at Nevatim Air Base overall, there is good news and bad, as far as Israel is concerned. The base took a lot of hits, which suggests that Israel’s ballistic missile defenses were, at least to some degree, overwhelmed. This is not all that surprising. As we pointed out repeatedly after the first attack in April, the next one would use new tactics, with oversaturating missile defenses and focusing on a small number of large area military targets in remote locations —airbases especially — being likely the foundations for a future attack plan. The lack of damage may be due to the inherent difficulties in targeting an air base at such a long distance or may point to a high level of failures and low level of accuracy of Iran’s longer-ranged ballistic missiles. It's always possible Iran could intentionally have chosen target areas, not specific structures or objects, to go after in order to decrease the likelihood of a major counter-attack while still accomplishing their propaganda goals at home and throughout the Middle East. Still, this seems like a less likely possibility. We also need to factor in Israeli efforts to defend against Iranian missile strikes beyond using its ballistic missile defenses — and those of allies. Israel will almost certainly have also employed electronic warfare, such as GPS disruption and 'left of launch' tactics to degrade Iran’s ballistic missile capabilities via non-kinetic means. It could also simply be that, on this occasion, Nevatim Air Base — and Israel — did indeed get lucky. New video showing Iran's preparations for the October 1 strike inside an underground facility. The footage includes both Ghadr missiles and what appear to be either Kheybarshekan or Fattah 1 missiles. pic.twitter.com/PvblZ6ihU0&mdash; Fabian Hinz (@fab_hinz) October 4, 2024 The main takeaway, however, is that Iran has demonstrated that it can strike Israel with numerous ballistic missiles. Were the same missiles to have targeted civilian areas, the loss of life could have been very severe. If they were turned against broad area infrastructure targets, the damage could also be very problematic. The worry, now, for Israel is not only that Iran can strike its territory, but also that it’s increasing the number of missiles in its inventory, enhancing their accuracy and hardening them to countermeasures, making them an even greater threat. Also, such a large real-world use like this latest attack provides critical data to Iran on how to improve these already rapidly developing long-range strike systems. With Israel poised to retaliate at any time and Iran threatening to wipe out Israel's critical infrastructure if they do, another barrage could come in the near future.

Watch Turkey’s ‘Solo Turk’ F-16 Demo Jet’s Close Call During A Re...	One of the best-known military jet demonstrations currently active, the Turkish Air Force’s 'Solo Turk' F-16 team, appears to have had an extremely close call at a recent airshow. Footage of the incident has appeared widely on social media, as well as unconfirmed reports of an investigation into what happened. Based on what we can see from the available videos, the pilot seems to have had a very lucky escape with the jet intact.

The incident appears to have taken place yesterday, with the festival running from October 2-6. At the end of the airshow display, the pilot waggles the wings and then performs a roll above the runway, but the nose of the F-16 drops alarmingly, leaving the jet inverted and pointing toward the ground — and seemingly also near the crowd line. Based on where the available videos are shot from, it’s not easy to tell exactly how close to the ground the aircraft got, but it certainly appears alarming, especially considering the fighter jet speeds involved. An F-16C of the Solo Turk demo team performing during the Royal International Air Tattoo at RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire, England, on July 20, 2024. Photo by MI News/NurPhoto via Getty Images MI News TWZ spoke to one former fast jet pilot who gave their opinion on the footage, observing that the distance between the F-16 and the ground at the lowest point appears to be 'a small number of wingspans.' 'It might have been that the pilot wanted to do some form of hesitation roll and actually paused at 180 degrees — but even so that requires you to really hawk your velocity vector,' the same pilot added. A previous display routine seen from the cockpit of the Solo Turk F-16: Whatever the case, it seems almost certain that the airshow organizers would have called for the display sequence to be terminated, were it not that the pilot was already on their final pass. The fighter pilot we spoke to also considered it 'highly likely that the display director would have red-carded the pilot.' Rolling maneuvers of any kind in close proximity to the ground require great skill and precision on the part of the pilot, and the jet’s nose placement has to be very closely monitored at all times. It may be the case that the pilot was not at fault here, though. There are unconfirmed reports that the F-16 may have had some kind of flight-control system malfunction, leading to an uncontrolled dive, which the pilot then reacted to, climbing out. 01 Ekim 2024 Teknofest Adana uçuş saatlerimiz… pic.twitter.com/Lt4IckpMTv&mdash; SOLOTÜRK (@soloturk) September 30, 2024 Reports from Turkey state that an investigation has now been launched into exactly what happened. In the meantime, the Solo Turk F-16 display remains one of the best-regarded on the European airshow circuit and one that has an excellent safety record. The Solo Turk team — which operates out of Konya Air Base — has around a dozen personnel, including two pilots, plus a CN235 support aircraft and has received several awards for its airshow performances. For now, the dramatic footage is a reminder of the very line between a breathtaking airshow routine and disaster. The fact that such close calls are a relatively rare occurrence speaks to the preparation and close cooperation between air forces and airshow organizers to ensure that these displays remain safe — and spectacular.

First Plutonium Pit For Nuclear Warhead Produced In The U.S. In 3...	The Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) has announced the completion of the first weapon-ready example of a vital component for the W87-1 warhead. The component, called a 'plutonium pit,' is the radioactive component that acts as a first stage 'trigger' apparatus used to initiate the detonation of the thermonuclear device. Plans call for the W87-1s to be used in the future LGM-35A Sentinel nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), a program that is massively over budget and faces numerous issues. The NNSA calls this 'an important milestone for the United States’ nuclear weapon stockpile modernization' as it phases out the aging W78 warheads, one of two types that are placed atop LGM-30G Minuteman III ICBMs currently stationed in silos. The other is the W87-0. A Minuteman III missile in its silo. USAF 'The W87-1 nuclear warhead will replace the W78 nuclear warhead, which was first introduced in 1979 and represents the oldest weapon in the U.S. nuclear stockpile that has not undergone a major life extension or replacement,' the Government Accountability Office noted. 'The W87-1 will be carried on the Air Force’s Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile and is slated for deployment in the early 2030s.' The W87-0s will initially be installed on Sentinels, but those will eventually be phased out as well. To make any of this happen, however, NNSA needs new plutonium pits. A good description of how the pits play a critical role in a nuclear warhead can be found at the Bulletin Of The Atomic Scientists, stating: 'Pits are the hollow plutonium cores of the fission 'primaries' (triggers) of two-stage modern warheads. A warhead explosion would begin with the implosion of the pit to supercriticality, which would enable an exponentially growing fission chain reaction in the plutonium. That fission explosion—'boosted' by neutrons from a fusion reaction in tritium-deuterium gas injected into the middle of the hollow pit just before implosion—would ignite a much more powerful 'secondary' nuclear fission-fusion explosion.' Inside this pit of plutonium-239 is a chamber of hydrogen gas. The high temperatures and pressures created by the plutonium-239 fission cause the hydrogen atoms to fuse. This fusion process releases neutrons, which feed back into the plutonium-239, splitting more atoms and boosting the fission chain reaction, making a more powerful bomb. How a thermonuclear warhead works. (Union of Concerned Scientists) The W78 warhead is said to have a yield of 335 kilotons. It is unclear what the W87-1’s exact will be, but the original W87 warhead has a reported baseline yield of 300 kilotons. The follow-on variant is understood to be modifiable to increase the weapon’s yield to 475 kilotons. By way of comparison, the bomb dropped on Hiroshima was vastly less powerful, producing a yield of 16 kilotons. At issue is that the U.S. hasn’t produced these pits in more than three decades. During the Cold War, the U.S. could manufacture hundreds of these pits every year, but production ceased in 1989, NNSA explained. The goal is to rebuild 'the capability to manufacture plutonium pits, at the rate of no fewer than 80 pits per year…and recapitalize production capabilities that atrophied in the post-Cold War era across the Nuclear Security Enterprise,' NNSA states. Los Alamos National Laboratory’s Plutonium Facility-4 produced the first weapon-ready W87-1 pit. A prototype of the nose cone 'shroud' that will go on top of each LGM-35A goes flying during a test. (Northrop Grumman) However, the Sentinel missile program is troubled, faced with massive cost overruns and delays, including the development of sufficient plutonium pits. As we noted previously, the U.S. Air Force is pushing ahead with Sentinel despite a new projected price tag of nearly $141 billion, close to twice the original estimate, and now years of expected delays. The main factor driving costs up is largely the result of required upgrades to existing missile silos and other launch and command and control infrastructure rather than the missile itself. A rendering of a future Sentinel silo, which also highlights that much of the facility is expected to be entirely new. (Northrop Grumman) The plan to develop new plutonium pits is also facing budget and scheduling headwinds as new production facilities are needed to meet the demands. 'One of the production lines is in an advanced state of installation at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, the home of US pit-production expertise,' the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists (BAS) explained in a 2023 report. 'The other is to be installed at the Department of Energy’s Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina, where there is no pit-production expertise.' NNSA’S plutonium pit announcement 'is significant because Los Alamos has to demonstrate that the new W87-1 (which is already in development) can actually be supplied with the new pit in time for them to be able to deliver the warhead to the military on time (when the Sentinel ICBM is ready),' nuclear weapons expert Hans M. Kristensen told The War Zone. The Los Alamos Laboratory's Plutonium Facility-4 produced the first weapon-ready W87-1 plutonium pit. (Photo by Joe Raedle) Joe Raedle However, 'there is considerable doubt that the pit production program and therefore the W87-1 program will be able to deliver as planned,' added Kristensen, Director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists and Associate Senior Fellow to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. The planned factories 'are delayed and a new lawsuit has just ruled that DOE/NNSA violated the law by shortcutting regulations,' he noted. 'That will almost certainly cause further delays.' 'The timelines and cost projections are not realistic,' he posited. After eight years of development, the first fully certified plutonium pit for the future W87-1 warhead has been produced. will replace W78 and be one of two warheads (with W87-0; image), on the future Sentinel ICBM. pic.twitter.com/H8bhxWB3zM&mdash; Hans Kristensen (@nukestrat) October 2, 2024 The production of the first weapon-ready plutonium pit is just a first step in a long journey, Dylan Spaulding, senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told The War Zone. 'It is important to note that this doesn’t mean production will take off exponentially. It’s likely that not every pit produced will meet standards and the congressionally mandated goal of 80 pits per year by 2030 is still very much out of reach,' he said. 'We feel that that goal is both unnecessary and dangerous.' We asked NNSA to respond to the comments, made Thursday afternoon, by Kristensen and Spaulding. We will update this story with any pertinent details it provides. The challenges faced by the Sentinel come as China continues to dramatically expand its nuclear stockpile and ICBM arsenal= and Russia has reemerged as a glaring strategic threat. Meanwhile, the U.S. hasn't made a new nuclear weapon since the end of the Cold War more than three decades ago.

Navy Making Final Selection For F/A-XX Stealth Fighter, Plans For...	The U.S. Navy expects its sixth-generation fighter to enter service in the 2030s, bringing with it the ability to operate alongside drones and fly missions at long ranges — capabilities seen as essential for future conflict with China. The Navy’s ambitions, if realized, mean that the service may introduce its next-generation crewed fighter before the U.S. Air Force, which is now re-examining requirements for its new stealth combat jet, with the program on temporary hold. As it sits now, the Navy is late in the source selection process on who will build its next generation fighter and that decision could come soon. Like the Air Force, the Navy is working on its sixth-generation fighter as part of a program named Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD). The Navy crewed fighter is often referred to as the F/A-XX. The Navy is involved in direct cooperation with the Air Force’s program and both initiatives put crewed fighters at the center of a broader ‘system of systems’ that will also include advanced Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones. A Boeing concept artwork for the F/A-XX next-generation carrier fighter. Boeing But increasingly the programs seem that they might be headed in differing directions, certainly as far as current timelines are concerned. The Navy’s sixth-generation fighter will have 'advanced sensors, advanced lethality, advanced range, and being able to integrate with manned and unmanned capabilities together,' according to Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti, quoted in an article by Air & Space Forces Magazine. This matches what we previously knew about the initiative. Based on what we know about the two services sharing some technology and even control capabilities for CCA drones, it’s not a surprise that Franchetti mentions the manned/unmanned integration. 'That’s one of the things, as we learn from the Air Force and the work they’re doing, to integrate that with what we know that we need to be able to do,' she added. Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti. U.S. Navy photo by Senior Chief Mass Communication Specialist Elliott Fabrizio/Released Senior Chief Petty Officer Elliott Fabrizio The mention of range is also particularly interesting. Faced with the prospect of a potential future war in the Pacific with China and facing ever more advanced and further-reaching air defenses, as well as the vast distances involved in such a theater, long range was always seen as being one of the core capabilities of the Air Force’s NGAD fighter. That requirement is likely now being reassessed, although the Navy remains committed to it, according to Franchetti. Allowing for the carrier air wing to be able to reach relevant target sets and a a significant frequency while keeping the carrier itself at a safe distance from anti-ship and other anti-access capabilities is a glaring issue for the USN. Dramatically increasing the unrefueled combat radius of at least some of its fighters, which would be paired with CCAs with similar endurance, would go a long way to solving this problem. The Chief of Naval Operations added that the service plans to place a contract in time for the new fighter to enter service in the 2030s. This is the same kind of timeline that was anticipated for the Air Force’s equivalent new stealth fighter, but the current situation could push that date further to the right. Exactly how the Air Force’s NGAD fighter might be rescoped is unclear at this point and elements of the design have always been a tightly guarded secret anyway. As it stands, however, the Air Force’s NGAD program is under deep review, and it’s possible that there will be significant revisions to better reflect what the service wants — or can afford — out of its next fighter. Above all, this situation has been driven by the realization that the highly advanced aircraft might cost three times as much as a new F-35 — upwards of $300 million per copy. The Air Force is now eying pursuing a far less expensive aircraft, coming in at roughly the same price as an F-35 or F-15EX does, at around $90 million to $100 million each. You can read our deep dive into what this revised NGAD could look like here. An F-35C stealth fighter carrying AGM-158C Long-Range Anti-Ship Missiles (LRASM). U.S. Navy/Dane Wiedmann U.S. Navy/Dane Wiedmann The Navy’s F/A-XX has also not been free of financial woes. As we reported back in the summer, the program’s budget, which was already set to be truncated, could be cut even more severely in the next fiscal year. Members of the Senate are proposing to give the service nearly 90 percent less funding than it asked for to support continued work on the new carrier-based fighter. 'Black budgets' also play a role in a program like this too. Franchetti didn’t appear to mention those fiscal concerns, but the fact that she still said the service expects the aircraft to enter service in the 2030s makes it clear that the program remains a top priority. Still, it's questionable just how achievable that goal is and '2030s' is a broad window to begin with. Whether realistic or not, the Navy will first have to choose between Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman, which are currently in competition to provide the F/A-XX. Franchetti said that the service is now in the process of selecting which design to pursue. Meanwhile, it is understood that just Boeing and Lockheed Martin are perusing the USAF's manned NGAD fighter tender, with Northrop Grumman dropping out of the competition in part to focus on the Navy's program. It was always considered likely that the F/A-XX would share a powerplant with the NGAD, with technology for this being developed under the Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion (NGAP) program. With that in mind, it’s possible that the Air Force reducing the goals of the NGAP program — in line with reductions in performance targets — could have a knock-on effect on the capabilities of the Navy’s NGAD fighter. Whether the Navy would be willing to take a performance hit on its fighter if it meant saving a lot of money, both in development costs and eventual production expenditures, is unclear. General Electric's XA100 adaptive cycle jet engine during testing in 2020. General Electric GE's XA100 engine on a test stand. GE Aviation Aside from the cost factor now impacting decisions on the future of the Air Force NGAD program, there are increasing signs that the service is also reconsidering whether the crewed fighter concept, as understood up to now, is actually the best to meet emerging threats. As far as we know, however, the Navy still expects its F/A-XX and its accompanying drones to replace its F/A-18E/F Super Hornet multirole fighters as well as its EA-18G Growler electronic attack jet, all part of reshaping a carrier air wing that could eventually feature as much as two-thirds uncrewed aircraft. Intriguingly, however, Franchetti said that, while it’s important that the Navy and Air Force NGAD programs are aligned to some degree, this wasn’t the most critical factor in the Navy’s F/A-XX efforts. Making an effort to distance F/A-XX from the current uncertainties around the Air Force’s NGAD is perhaps understandable, considering the pause on the latter program. The Navy should have a much better idea of how the Air Force’s potential overhaul of its NGAD affects its program of the same name once the flying branch makes a decision on the path it wants to take for its sixth-generation fighter initiative. Such a decision is due to be made in the next few months. An artist’s illustration depicts a sixth-generation air dominance fighter of the kind being developed under NGAD. Boeing The Air Force has reiterated that it is committed to having a crewed stealth fighter at the heart of the wider NGAD initiative and that it will have a human pilot to start with, although an optionally crewed version might ultimately be developed too. 'I’m absolutely confident we’re still going to do a sixth-generation crewed aircraft,' Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall said in July of this year. Even if the Air Force NGAD effort ends up taking a radically different approach to meeting the service’s future air combat requirements, that also doesn’t mean that the Navy will not be able to benefit from technologies and concepts spun off from that program or run collaboratively. 'I think more broadly, as all the services work together to make sure that they have complementary capability, ‘Where can we learn from each other?'' Franchetti asked. 'Where can we leverage that learning so you can be more common in the future?' While the Air Force NGAD initiative has been characterized by its secrecy, the equivalent Navy sixth-generation fighter program has been proceeding, if anything, even more in the shadows. It remains to be seen to what degree the pause on the Air Force program will affect the F/A-XX, but the release of any new details about the programs at this critical stage is of great interest, to say the least.

How The AIM-174 Could Pop China’s Anti-Access Bubble In The Pacif...	The Navy has officially acknowledged the existence of a weapon we had posited it was developing for years, an air-launched version of the hugely versatile, far reaching, and hard hitting ship-launched SM-6. Designated the AIM-174, this massive, F/A-18 Super Hornet-carried air-to-air weapon is by default longer-ranged than any other the U.S. has ever fielded. While it isn’t clear if the AIM-174 will also retain the SM-6’s secondary anti-ship and land attack capabilities, just what it could provide in the anti-air and possibly anti-ballistic missile roles could be truly revolutionary. Clearly built to take full advantage of the Pentagon’s emerging ‘kill webs,’ this is especially true when it comes to popping China’s vaunted anti-access bubble by going after its most prized force-multiplier assets. So, how exactly could this work and what does it bring to the table? We break it all down for you in detail in the video posted at the top of this troy.

Iranian Oil Tankers Bolting From Major Export Island Ahead Of Pos...	Iranian oil tankers have fled Kharg Island ahead of a potential retaliation strike by Israel which has vowed vengeance for Tuesday’s massive Iranian missile barrage. The island, handling 90% of Iran’s oil exports, is thought to be at the very top the reprisal target list for Israel. 'The National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC) appears to be fearing an imminent attack by Israel,' TankerTrackers reported on Twitter Thursday afternoon. 'Their empty [Very Large Crude Carrier] VLCC supertankers vacated the country's largest oil terminal, Kharg Island, yesterday.'

'We're in discussion of that. I think that would be a little… anyway,' Biden told reporters at the White House when asked if he supported Israel hitting Iran’s oil facilities. Many Israeli officials 'point to Iran’s oil facilities as a likely target, but some say targeted assassinations and taking out Iran’s air defense systems are also possibilities,' Axios reported. 'The Israeli response could include airstrikes from fighter jets as well as clandestine operations similar to the one that killed Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran two months ago.' This largely matches our analysis from Tuesday. Iran's Kharg Oil Terminal is high on the list of potential Israeli targets in any retaliation attack. (Photo by Fatemeh Bahrami/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images) Anadolu S&P Commodity Insights said oil and gas prices have already spiked globally after Iran's attack on Israel. 'Brent crude prices jumped 5% on Oct. 1 and global energy markets were on tenterhooks after Iran launched a new missile attack on Israel, sparking concerns of a major regional escalation and a direct conflict between Israel and Iran.' Prices could go higher should Israel attack Iranian oil facilities. Not only would that affect Iranian exports, but Israel too produces oil and could be hit by any Iranian response. 'The attack by Iran through missile strikes into Israel escalates the existing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah and Israel and Hamas, and likely puts at least some Israeli oil infrastructure, including 287,000 b/d of Israeli refining capacity, at greater risk,' oil analysts at S&P Global Commodity Insights said in a note.

'We will respond, we know how to locate important targets, we know how to strike with precision and power,' said Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi. 'We have the capabilities to reach and strike any point in the Middle East. And those of our enemies who have not yet understood this, will soon understand.' Our analysis also pointed to Iran's oil infrastructure as the most likely target set for Israel to hit just after the ballistic missile barrage occurred. Not only would destroying the country's primary energy export terminal have major economic impacts for Iran, but accessing the target would be less complicated and risky for Israel than executing strikes deeper in Iran, especially against hardened nuclear or regime targets and/or dispersed military capabilities.

With the ongoing direct military operations now on two fronts, Gaza and Lebanon, the IDF certainly has its hands full and the big question then is what will Iran do in response to such a strike. The escalation ladder it steep and largely unexplored at this point.

Claims Swirl Around Israeli Strikes Very Near Russia’s Air Base I...	Israeli conducted strikes near the Syrian coast this morning, with explosions reported in the vicinity of the Russian-operated Khmeimim Air Base, near the city of Latakia. At this stage, it’s not clear if the Russian airfield was actually hit, deliberately or otherwise — which would be a first. Either way, however, the attacks represent a notable escalation in terms of Israel’s willingness to prosecute targets that are very close to this key Russian military facility in Syria and a major point of pride for Moscow. Three hours ago, Israel struck and destroyed a weapons depot at the Hmeimim base on the Syrian coast, shortly after the arrival of an Iranian weapons shipment.

POV 35.3721083, 35.9250677 looking North East pic.twitter.com/0uyylyvfr3&mdash; Rocket Man (@Grimm_Intel) October 3, 2024 Initial accounts from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a U.K.-based information office, describe attacks in the coastal Latakia province, with targets including an ammunition warehouse said to be near Jablah city, not far from Khmeimim Air Base. Weapons supplied by Iran and destined for Hezbollah, its Lebanese ally and proxy, often are delivered first to Syria, for onward transit to Lebanon. The suggestion here is that Iranian munitions headed for the militant group were targeted soon after they arrived in Syria. According to Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Avichay Adraee, Hezbollah has been recently smuggling weapons into Lebanon from Syria via the Masnaa border crossing. Only yesterday, the IDF released a video showing examples of Russian-made weapons it says its troops captured in Lebanon, including Metis-M anti-tank guided missiles, Strela-2 man-portable air defense systems, MRO-A rocket-propelled anti-personnel flamethrowers, and RPG-29 Vampire and RPG-27 Tavolga rocket-propelled grenades. The SOHR says that the warehouse in Jablah was destroyed and also reports the 'presence of warships in the sea, and warplanes believed to be Israeli.' The group says that Syrian and Russian air defenses were active for more than 40 minutes in an effort to thwart the attacks. The mention of Israeli Navy warships in the SOHR account is unusual, but it cannot be confirmed that these were the source of the attacks. Normally, Israel has used its fighter aircraft to conduct missions of this kind, although Israeli Navy warships have had a presence off Syrian shores. The Israeli Navy is not notably heavily-equipped for striking targets on land, although it’s possible that the latest Gabriel 5 anti-ship missile can also be used for land attack. An export version of this weapon, the Sea Breaker, is advertised as having a precision land attack capability, thanks to its imaging infrared seeker. Gabriel 5 missiles are used by the latest Sa’ar 6 class corvettes and may be fitted to older Sa’ar 5 class corvettes, as well. They are thought to have a range of up to 248 miles. Israel's submarine fleet is also capable of launching the secretive Popeye Turbo long-range cruise missiles, but those are thought to be only configured for nuclear strikes as they make up the country's second-strike deterrent. Another possibility, and one that would tally with reports of drones being in the air at the time of the attacks, is that Israel launched one-way attack drones or loitering munitions from warships or other vessels off the coast. As TWZ has discussed before, Israel has developed a ship-based version of its popular Harop drone. Standard versions could also be launched from containers on a ship's deck. Concept artwork showing the ship-launched Harop drone. IAI Reports on Syrian state television said that Israel was responsible for bombing Khmeimim Air Base 'an hour after the arrival of an Iranian plane belonging to Qeshm Airlines.' The same source claims that the Israelis’ targets were 'military sites in Latakia province' as well as a warehouse within the perimeter of the air base. 'The Israeli strike did not target the runways or towers at Khmeimim Air Base and Latakia’s civilian airport,' Syrian state television says.

Two years later, the Russian government signed a new long-term lease for the base with Syrian authorities, as part of a larger deal that also saw Russia extend its access to port facilities at Tartus, further to the south, for at least another 49 years. This arrangement came after Russian forces, especially combat airpower, had been instrumental in preventing the collapse of the regime of Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad. Now, the facility serves as the only Russian airfield on the Mediterranean, a highly strategic but also symbolic prize that Moscow gained in exchange for saving Assad.

The SOHR reports that an Israeli airstrike on the Syrian capital resulted in the death of Hassan Jaafar, the son-in-law of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. He was said to be one of three killed — with another three injured — when a building was flattened in the Mezzah district in the west of the city. Early reports indicate that #Hezbollah secretary-general Hassan Nasrallah's son-in-law, Hassan Jaafar Qasir, was killed in airstrikes on the Mezzeh neighborhood in Damascus on Wednesday, according to Sky News Arabic. pic.twitter.com/x2QOW54G9S&mdash; Jason Brodsky (@JasonMBrodsky) October 2, 2024 Israel has long been carrying out strikes against Iran-linked targets in Syria but has increased the intensity of such raids since last year’s October 7 attack by the Palestinian militant group Hamas on Israeli territory. These latest strikes are being carried out in addition to attacks on targets in Gaza, Lebanon, and Yemen. In the course of this year so far, the SOHR has documented 94 Israeli attacks on Syrian territory, comprising 77 airstrikes and 17 rocket/missile attacks by ground forces. In the process, the group says that Israel destroyed nearly 185 targets, including buildings, weapons and ammunition warehouses, headquarters, vehicles, and others. SOHR claims that the strikes killed 250 combatants and injured 177 others. Of those casualties, significant numbers are said to have been from the IRGC and Hezbollah. The majority of these attacks have targeted objectives in and around Damascus. The latest round of Israeli attacks is different, though, in that Israel has apparently targeted Iran-linked objectives — specifically, weapons destined for Hezbollah —in very close proximity to the most important Russian military hub in Syria. Perhaps, Israel has even deliberately targeted a facility at the air base itself, although that remains unclear. In either scenario, the incident is concerning for Russia and Syria in terms of air defenses. Khmeimim is the major hub for Russian air defense systems in the country, although repeated attacks by drones have raised previous questions about just how resilient this defensive umbrella is. Its current status is murky. On one hand tactics should have improved after years or war in Ukraine. On the other hand, Russia has shifted many air defense assets to that conflict. So, exactly what level of protection remains at the installation, at least as of yesterday, isn't clear. A Russian Pantsir-S1 low-level air defense system in Syria in September 2019. MAXIME POPOV/AFP via Getty Images Israel has previously hit targets very close to the Russian naval base at Tartus, prompting an angered reaction from the Kremlin. Again, weapons headed to Hezbollah appear to have been the targets. Israel historically also gave Russia advance warning about its attacks on targets in Syria, although this may well no longer be the case. For its part, Israel almost never comments on attacks of this kind within Syria, and satellite imagery of the base is so far inconclusive. The available low-resolution imagery from this morning shows everywhere but some of the main apron and core of the base’s operations and administration area but with no obvious damage or smoke. If this attack was indeed within the perimeter of the air base, it would appear that Israel has now decided that the risk is one worth taking if it’s to succeed in intercepting weapons before they get into the hands of Hezbollah in Lebanon. It would also indicate that this installation, while still technically belonging to the Assad regime, is being used for weapons transfers which Russia would likely be privy to. This would be a major change in what is publicly known about how this Russian-leased installation is used.

Surreal Missile Battle In The Sky Seen In Astonishing Video Of Ir...	It's rare we see a video that is truly unique — a scene or thing that has never been captured before. One incredible example of just such a thing is a video that has surfaced out of Jordan, supposedly near Amman, of the night sky taken with an infrared camera. It captured Iran's massive simultaneous ballistic missile barrage. In it, we see just how densely packed the sky was as these weapons careened toward their targets and Israel's and the United States' frantic work at countering as many as they could before they slammed into Israeli soil. The video, taken by Zaid M. Al-Abbadi who takes beautiful photos and videos of the night sky, looks like an immense meteor shower in a fantastical sci-fi movie or the last scene in a film that depicts the apocalypse — natural or manmade. It's both eerily beautiful and absolutely terrifying at the same time. This version of the video, posted here on Facebook, is the best we have seen. It shows some of the mid-course interceptor launches out of Israel even before the ballistic missiles come into view: View this post on Instagram A post shared by Zaid M.

Al-Abbadi (@zaidmalabbadi) Additional footage Source- pic.twitter.com/8EsaEJ5Izd&mdash; OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) October 2, 2024 The video is sped up about 10 times, but even then, just how fast this all occurred is dizzying. Also, this is just a portion of the sky, much occurred out of frame. Judging by the interceptor launches early on, this included at least some mid-course engagements. The higher volume of interceptors chewing away at the remarkably dense barrage were more likely to have been terminal ballistic missile interceptors, such as David's Sling, THAAD (if a battery deployed in-country), and possibly SM-6, but that is questionable. Israel retired its Patriot missile batteries earlier this year. You can read a complete breakdown of Israel's integrated air defense system here. It is very challenging to get a firm estimate of how many missiles were seen flying to their targets and how many intercepts occurred, but the numbers are very large on both sides, with dozens of intercepts seen in the video. The video made me immediately think of one of the most jaw-dropping set pieces in Andor: There is also a tour-de-force in physics being displayed in chaotic fashion, with what appear to be collisions, failures and even ricochets depicted. Above all else, this incredible video clearly displays what we long expected, that Iran would absolutely saturate the skies with a wall-like barrage of ballistic missiles in an attempt to overwhelm Israel's robust defenses. This clearly worked, at least to a degree, but where those missiles actually landed and how much damage was done remains a glaring question. Significant, albeit not widespread damage is already appearing in satellite images of one of Israel's key air bases. We also don't know what other measures were used to throw the missiles off track, including any 'left of launch tactics' and GPS jamming/manipulation. Regardless, the video certainly shows the kinetic measures that were put into play by air defenders in a desperate attempt to whittle down the sheer mass of the barrage.

U.S. Army AH-64 Apaches Practice Downing Drones With Hellfire Mis...	U.S. Army AH-64 Apache attack helicopters are refining their ability to detect and destroy enemy aerial drones while forward deployed to the Middle East, a region where the drone threat — especially from one-way attack munitions or 'kamikaze drones' — has exploded in recent months. Apaches have a little-known but proven capability to act in an air defense role against drones. This includes using their AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, which are traditionally air-to-ground weapons, to take them down. A recent video published by Central Command shows a U.S. Army AH-64D Longbow Apache attack helicopter destroying a target drone during the Red Sands exercise in Saudi Arabia. Red Sands is a joint Saudi-CENTCOM-sponsored exercise that focuses partially on counter-unmanned aircraft systems (C-UAS) capabilities, including trialing emerging countermeasure technologies. The Kingdom is no stranger to the threats posed by increasingly capable but comparatively inexpensive drones, especially the long-range one-way attack types. . @USArmy Soldiers engage an unmanned aerial system (UAS) from an AH-64 with upgraded Hellfire missile during Red Sands training exercise in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. @usarmycentral pic.twitter.com/HG9ChuWxt6&mdash; U.S. Central Command (@CENTCOM) September 30, 2024 The video shows a pair of Apaches targeting a drone with an AGM-114 Hellfire missile. The type used appears to be a variant or modification of the AGM-114L, which features a millimeter-wave radar seeker that is initially cued by the Apache's AN/APG-78 Longbow mast-mounted radar system. Combined, the radar and missile pairing allow Apaches to launch multiple Hellfires against ground targets — primarily vehicles — simultaneously and in any weather. The radar is capable of detecting and tracking some aerial targets, like lower-flying helicopters, but, as it may show in the video, detecting and engaging aerial drones could now be in its playbook as well.

Dean John Kd De Dios The use of AGM-114s and Apaches to swat down lower-end long-endurance drones is not new. Israel has been using the Apache in an air defense role for this purpose for years, which includes one well-known shootdown near the Syrian border of a Hezbollah drone. AH-64s were built with an austere air-to-air capability from the get-go, with the capacity to employ FIM-92 Stinger short-range heat-seeking missiles, but the Hellfire-Longbow combo could take this capability to a whole other level. It's also worth noting that the same general types of radar-guided Hellfires are being used on some Littoral Combat Ships to rapidly engage swarms of small boats. We have discussed in the past that this capability could also be adapted to taking down nearby slow and low aerial drones as well. AH-64 lets loose a Hellfire bound for a target drone during the Red Sands exercise. (CENTCOM screencap) The Apache's other weapons, like its 30mm cannon, can also play a role in counter-drone defense, but getting close enough and precisely targeting a drone with the gun system in such a fashion can be challenging and even quite dangerous, both in terms of the aerial dynamics at play and the fact that the drone likely carries a powerful blast fragmentation warhead. The highly destructive cannon rounds that do not connect with the target will also fall somewhere and at altitude this can be over a large area. Still, the gun has its uses against aerial targets, as seen in the video below.

APKWS joins a laser-guided control section to a standard 70mm Hydra rocket. APKWS has been tested with fighters in the air-to-air role and is now being used in a surface-to-air counter-UAS role in Ukraine. They are also far less costly than a Hellfire, coming in at around $25-30k per round compared to around $215k for an AGM-114 with the radar-guided L models costing even more. Still, $215k is relatively cheap compared to many modern air-to-air missiles and surface-to-air missiles. A laser weapon has been tested on Apache, but little is known about the status of that concept at this time. AH-64s also now have Joint-Air-to-Ground-Missile (JAGM) in their inventory with their multi-mode seeker capabilities, which could dramatically expand the helicopter's counter-drone efficacy even more. Not all of the U.S. Army's AH-64s — which include AH-64E Apache Guardians and some remaining AH-64D Longbows — carry the Longbow radar at all times, but the aircraft have the ability to share targeting information with others in their formation, so even if just one Apache has it, its data can be exploited by the flight. The Apache Guardian is a particularly highly networked asset beyond simpler intra-flight datalinks. This allows for greater situational awareness and connectivity with command nodes and other platforms in the battlespace, all of which could play a major factor in the drone defense mission. The evolving ability of the AH-64E to team with its own drone wingmen could also open up the C-UAS mission in unique ways, including drastically expanding area of defensive coverage a single aircrew can provide and bringing new distributed sensors to the fight. You can read all about the AH-64E's networking capabilities and manned-unmanned teaming operations in this previous feature.

Dean John Kd De Dios Apaches acting in this unique role have other advantages. Unlike ground-based air defenses, they can be rapidly repositioned and set up counter-drone screening wherever is most advantageous within their combat radius. They can also position forward, with ground forces if need be, and quickly take to the air in order to respond to incoming threats. Escorting ground forces and providing overwatch while also some drone defense capacity is another possibility and even protecting other airborne helicopters from enemy drones is a potential application for the concept. A radar-equipped Apache offers a networked and elevated sensor and weapons platform capability that is uniquely capable of detecting hard to spot, low and slow-flying targets amongst the ground clutter, although not over long distances. The fact that the Apache's radar can detect and track many targets at one time could potentially also allow for rapid engagements against swarms of incoming enemy drones where the timeframe to shoot will be very compressed. Hardware and software tweaks to the system may be needed to better acclimate the AH-64 to a robust C-UAS role, if that hasn't been fully realized already. Even with all these advantages, the AH-64 is still a helicopter with the speed and endurance limitations that go with it, but rotary-wing assets are increasingly playing a key role in the cocktail of measures being put into action to help counter the ballooning drone threat. The Red Sands exercise also comes at a very unique and troubling time in the region, with the multi-domain drone and missile barrages still being sent up regularly by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen and Iran and Israel teetering on the brink of a larger conflict. Tehran possesses massive numbers of long-range kamikaze drones spread amongst its forces and those of its proxies that would certainly be put into action if a larger conflict erupted across the Middle East, putting an expansive list of potential targets at risk. Under such circumstances, it will be an all-hands-on-deck effort to even attempt to counter these drones and the Apache could end up playing a tangible role in doing so. Regardless, let's hope its capabilities don't get put to the test.

World Braces For Israel’s Retaliation To Iran’s Ballistic Missile...	With Israeli leaders vowing to strike back strongly against Iran for Tuesday’s massive missile barrage, the world awaits Jerusalem's response. Fears are growing that continued escalation on both sides could lead to an all-out war in the region and possibly drag the U.S. into the fray. As we noted earlier today, the Chief of Staff of the Israeli Army said there will be retribution. 'We will respond, we know how to locate important targets, we know how to strike with precision and power,' said Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi. 'We have the capabilities to reach and strike any point in the Middle East. And those of our enemies who have not yet understood this, will soon understand.' *הרמטכ״ל בבסיס תל נוף: 'יש לנו יכולות להגיע ולתקוף בכל נקודה במזרח התיכון. ומי מהאויבים שלנו שלא הבין זאת עד עכשיו, יבין זאת בקרוב'**'יודעים שהחג לא שלם בלי החטופים. מחויבים להמשיך ולעשות הכל בכדי להחזיר אותם, וכואבים את החללים שנפלו'* הרמטכ״ל, רב-אלוף הרצי הלוי, ביקר היום… pic.twitter.com/ezwYYZCggC&mdash; Israeli Air Force (@IAFsite) October 2, 2024 On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran would 'pay for' the attack, which officials claim caused minimal damage. 'The regime of Iran does not understand our determination to defend ourselves,' Netanyahu said in a statement delivered shortly after the attack, which came on the eve Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year. 'They will understand. We will stand by the rule we established: Whoever attacks, we will attack them.' Many Israeli officials 'point to Iran's oil facilities as a likely target, but some say targeted assassinations and taking out Iran's air defense systems are also possibilities,' Axios reported. 'The Israeli response could include airstrikes from fighter jets as well as clandestine operations similar to the one that killed Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran two months ago.' This largely matches our analysis from yesterday. Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces, Maj. Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, said his country's next response will be 'even more devastating' should Israel retaliate.

'But ultimately, it’s up to them — as it is for any sovereign country — to make their own decisions.' There is also a concern that the U.S., with 40,000 troops in the region, could become involved should any of its naval, air, or ground forces come under attack. The U.S. has bolstered its presence in the Middle East since the Oct. 7, 2023 surprise Hamas attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 Israelis. Tens of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in Israel's ensuing response. One open-source intelligence researcher offered a breakdown of the various missiles on Twitter based on videos of the strikes and images of the recovered missile remains. Among them were Kheiber Shekan medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBM). It is a two-stage, solid-propellant, vehicle-launched MRBM that Iran first unveiled on Feb. 9, 2022. A third generation of the Fateh family of ballistic missiles, Iran claims it has a maximum range of 1,450 kilometers (900 miles).

So far, at least eight Israeli soldiers have been killed in the fighting, according to the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). Israeli troops looking over a village in Lebanon as they fight with Hezbollah. (IDF) The IDF did not say how those troops died, but most of the casualties took place in the eastern sector of southern Lebanon, according to a Twitter dispatch from the Israeli YNET media outlet. A half-dozen Israeli troops were killed and 30 more wounded in a battle in a Lebanese village, according to YNET reporter Yoav Zitun. The village, which he didn’t name, was struck 650 times in the past months by Israeli forces in anticipation of a looming ground incursion, Zitun stated. The casualties occurred after Israeli forces ambushed Hezbollah fighters in a building 'during heavy fog…and in total darkness.' An assault 'by dozens of [Hezbollah] terrorists began from every direction and in poor visibility with low cloud cover that made it difficult for air cover,' Zitun explained. 'That was followed by 'a barrage of anti-tank and paramilitary fire on the rescue forces that arrived to evacuate the first victims.' Zitun claims that 30 Hezbollah fighters were killed in that battle, another 30 wounded and 50 killed overall since the start of the invasion.

U.S. Navy Destroyers 'Successfully Engaged' Iranian Ballistic Mis...	Multiple' Iranian missiles heading toward Israel on Tuesday were 'successfully engaged' by two U.S. Navy destroyers, a Navy spokesman said in a statement Wednesday morning. U.S. Sixth Fleet Arleigh Burke class guided missile destroyers USS Cole (DDG 67) and USS Bulkeley (DDG 84) 'engaged multiple Iranian ballistic missiles in defense of Israel from the Eastern Mediterranean Sea October 1, 2024,' Navy Capt. Bill Urban, lead spokesman for U.S. Naval Forces Europe/Africa said in a statement Wednesday morning. 'Multiple missiles are believed to have been successfully engaged at this time.' Both destroyers have 'the Aegis weapons system designed for ballistic missile defense and were stationed in the Eastern Mediterranean by the United States in advance of the Iranian launch as a part of U.S. Naval Forces Europe/Africa,' Urban added. The Navy released two videos showing interceptors being launched from the Bulkeley. The statement did not say what kind of interceptors or how many missiles were engaged. As we reported yesterday, about a dozen interceptors were launched against the Iranian missiles according to Air Force Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon’s top spokesman. He declined to confirm if they were Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) anti-ballistic missile interceptors. We reached out to the Navy for more details about the kind of interceptors launched and how many Iranian missiles were destroyed as a result. While it is possible the destroyers fired multi-purpose SM-6 missiles to engage the targets, that seems unlikely given where the Iranian missiles landed. SM-3s are used for midcourse engagements, while the targeted missile is flying outside the earth's atmosphere. SM-6s are used for more localized defense as the weapon is careening down toward the atmosphere during its terminal phase of flight.

Chinese Submarine That Sunk Had Exotic Hybrid Nuclear Powerplant:...	The mysterious Chinese submarine that apparently sunk in a shipyard earlier this year was the first of a new class featuring a hybrid nuclear/conventional propulsion system, according to a new report. The latest development in the saga of the Type 041 Zhou class submarine would seem to clear up some of the previous uncertainty about the boat as well as signal that China is working on novel solutions for its fast-growing underwater fleet. In a recent report citing unnamed defense officials, the Washington Times notes that the Type 041 'employs both conventional and nuclear propulsion,' specifically, 'a small nuclear reactor' in addition to a conventional powerplant. When the Type 041 was first identified in Wuchang Shipyard, it was assessed as being one of the Type 039A series boats, also known in the West as the Yuan class or a variant of it. The Type 039A is the first Chinese submarine with an air-independent propulsion (AIP) system, which greatly increases the time that it can remain submerged and makes it harder to detect, compared with traditional conventionally powered subs. A stock picture of a Type 039A or Yuan class submarine. via U.S. Navy Around a week ago, U.S. officials stated that the submarine in question had sunk and identified it as the first of a new class of boat, the Type 041 Zhou class. This was described as being a nuclear-powered attack submarine, or SSN, a type of boat that was not previously known to be built at the Wuchang Shipyard, which sits on the relatively shallow Yangtze River just outside the city of Wuhan. The yard is part of the state-owned China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC). The latest information from the United States suggests that the truth is somewhere in between, namely that the Type 041 features both kinds of powerplant. While still unconfirmed, this would make a lot of sense for several reasons and would also echo previous statements from Chinese officials. China military affairs analyst Rick Fisher told the Washington Times that, back in 2017, retired People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) Rear Adm. Zhao Dengping announced plans to develop a low-power/low-pressure nuclear reactor small enough to serve as an auxiliary engine for conventional submarines. A Soviet Juliett class conventional cruise missile submarine. One of these was equipped with a small nuclear reactor on a trials basis in the late 1980s. U.S. Navy Unknown Fisher says that the nuclear powerplant appears to be similar to a Soviet concept tested in the late 1980s on a single Project 651 Juliett class conventional cruise missile submarine. The ex-admiral said that the new reactor was intended to equip a 7,000-ton attack submarine that would also receive advanced weapons and electronics. He also said it would replace current AIP systems, as used in Type 039A. The concept of a hybrid propulsion system, with a nuclear reactor being used intermittently to charge batteries, or when a higher level of performance or longer range is needed, is an intriguing one, to say the least. Even before the possibility of hybrid propulsion was raised, it was notable that Chinese submarine developments were following a two-pronged path, with both nuclear- and conventionally-powered designs, in stark contrast to the all-nuclear U.S. Navy. Nuclear-powered submarines have the huge advantage of effectively unlimited range. Compared with conventionally powered alternatives, they are also faster and capable of staying submerged for time spans only limited to onboard provisions and maintenance demands. Even the most advanced AIP submarines, namely the ones that use fuel cell technology, still have to surface from time to time, including to refuel. This can be measured in weeks or less depending on how much energy is required during dive operations. On the other hand, conventionally powered submarines are invariably smaller and far cheaper to produce than their nuclear-powered counterparts. The latest AIP types also offer some capabilities that are similar to those of nuclear-powered attack submarines, albeit to a limited degree and only in certain ways. Notably, using lithium-ion batteries can provide extreme submerged endurance and very quiet operation and they are becoming an area of growing interest. The Japanese submarine Taigei, driven by an innovative propulsion system using lithium-ion batteries. JMSDF For China, specifically, a submarine that is small enough to operate with ease in littoral and shallower waters would be of huge interest. These points are of key importance for future contingencies in the South China Sea, or the Taiwan Strait, for example. Providing a smaller submarine with auxiliary nuclear propulsion, allowing it to remain at sea for an almost unlimited period, as well as for more extended periods submerged, would be better still. There is also the possibility that the Type 041 may combine its micro-nuclear reactor with lithium-ion batteries, meaning they can remain charged while fully submerged as needed, which would be a hugely significant development. Normally, a submarine with lithium-ion batteries needs to snorkel for charging, while the fuel cell is range-limited. An onboard nuclear generator could solve those issues. Meanwhile, putting these capabilities into a smaller hull should reduce costs and better contribute to the PLAN’s fast-growing submarine force. Size-wise, the Type 041 is reportedly around 10 percent longer than earlier attack submarines — like the Type 039A. The Type 039A is around 250 feet long, compared with around 360 feet for the Type 093 nuclear-powered attack submarine. This would make the Type 041 notably smaller and easier to move around than an SSN, while also making it suitable for construction at Wuchang Shipyard, which has previously not been used to build nuclear-powered submarines. &#8230;looking at multiple images of it, also appears to have an X-stern, a feature not seen before on any Chinese submarine.Measuring to the X-stern, what we can see of the new boat is over 80m long, compared to ~77m overall for the 039A. I'm guessing it's around 83-85m overall. pic.twitter.com/RUE1qIMA1q&mdash; Tom Shugart (@tshugart3) July 28, 2024 Quick thread on #Chinese submarine capabilities right now. Excuse typosFirst up.

We also know that it features an X-shaped stern. As we have discussed in the past, this feature is designed for improved maneuverability, efficiency, and safety, and also helps reduce the acoustic signature across significant parts of the submarine’s operating envelope. It would also appear to be optimized for operations in littoral and shallower waters. The stern section of the first Columbia class submarine, with X-form rudders, rides underneath the Jamestown Verrazzano Bridge heading to the General Dynamics Electric Boat plant in Quonset Point, Rhode Island. General Dynamics Electric Boat Whatever the plans for the Type 041, there’s also the fact that the first of these boats sunk, according to U.S. defense officials, raising questions about the status of the program and whether the boat is even salvageable. Citing unnamed U.S. officials, a report in The Wall Street Journal on September 26 describes the attempt by the Chinese authorities to cover up the accident, involving a submarine 'likely' carrying nuclear fuel when it sank. The boat had reportedly been undergoing its final fitting out before going to sea. There were no details provided about possible casualties in the accident, the possibility of which was first raised by Tom Shugart, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) think tank and a retired U.S. Navy submarine warfare officer, who identified unusual activity at the Wuchang Shipyard in June of this year. TWZ also examined satellite imagery showing the sudden appearance of four crane barges at the shipyard, as well as the disappearance of a submarine that had previously been in the berth.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION With the help of those four cranes, the submarine is said to have been salvaged, but getting it operational again will not be straightforward, with its internal spaces likely having filled with water, requiring the replacement of all the electronics and other systems. Chinese authorities have not commented on the incident and are unlikely to, especially since the submarine in question is a new design and one that incorporates several advanced — and possibly even unique — features. However, as more details about the Type 041 emerge, they shed light on the highly interesting nature of China’s submarine development program. On the one hand, the apparent sinking of the new submarine underlines questions that have been raised in the past about safety and quality control practices in Chinese naval shipbuilding. On the other hand, there’s no doubt that the expansion of the PLAN’s fleet, both surface and sub-surface is progressing very rapidly, even when it comes to large and/or complex vessels. With the latter point in mind, the Type 041 also seems to point to China’s willingness to explore new and advanced technologies as it seeks to field submarines that are best optimized for its requirements, including in terms of operating around the South China Sea, Taiwan, and other potential flashpoints in littoral and shallower waters.

B-52H Stratofortress Rocks Retro DayGlo Orange Paint Scheme	Oklahoma aviation photographer Rob Stephens recently captured some great images of a B-52H Stratofortress with the tail number 61-0028 as it was leaving Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma bound for Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. But this was not your ordinary 'BUFF.' Instead of the typical gray paint scheme, the jet, nicknamed 'Wolfpack,' sported DayGlo orange highlights on its forward fuselage, towards its wingtips, on its engine nacelles, and its vertical stabilizer. This striking paint scheme was done as a nod to the days when B-52A and B variants served as motherships for the North American X-15 experimental hypersonic rocket plane that the U.S. Air Force and NASA used for research purposes during the 1960s, among other mothership testing, Stephens told us. The B-52H Stratofortress 'Wolfpack' leaves Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma with a retro paint scheme honoring the days when earlier variants were motherships for the X-15 experimental rocket plane. (Redhome Aviation) REDHOME MEDIA CO The B-52 'arrived at Tinker in early 2024 for Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM) at the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center,' said Stephens, whose Redhome Aviation page features some stunning aircraft photos, including of the retro-painted Stratofortress. Tinker is where the 76th Aircraft Maintenance Group paint shop removed the old paint 'before the 565th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron performed detailed inspections and repairs to the 1960s-era bomber,' Stephens explained. After the PDM was completed, the B-52 'was flown on Aug. 26 by the 10th Flight Test Squadron, 413th Test Group, Air Force Reserve Command on a functional check flight lacking most of her paint,' according to the photographer. The 10th Flight Test Squadron conducted a functional check flight on Wolfpack in August. (Redhome Aviation) REDHOME MEDIA CO PDM involves a major overhaul and opportunities for important upgrades and modifications. As of 2021, each one of the service’s 76 B-52s was typically scheduled to undergo the months-long PDM process every four years. This scheduling is, of course, staggered to keep a certain number of bombers on active duty at any one time. Early indications of Wolfpack’s new paint scheme 'was her DayGlo orange rudder on her test flight, before the 76th AMXG repainted the aircraft in the standard gray with the DayGlo orange highlights' you see in the photo. The airframe was first flown with the new paint on Sept. 30 as 'Lobo49' and 'returned to the 49th Test and Evaluation Squadron at Barksdale, where she will receive her ‘OT’ and ‘49 TES’ tail markings, as well as an arrow on the tail and ‘U.S Air Force’ on her forward fuselage,' Stephens added. The aircraft was painted to replicate NB-52A 52-0003, he said. That aircraft, along with NB-52B 52-0008, completed the X-15 missions starting in 1959. High-altitude contrails frame the B-52 mothership as it carries the X-15 aloft for a research flight on 13 April 1960 on Air Force Maj. Robert M. White's first X-15 flight. (NASA) As we noted in our deep dive into the history of the Stratofortress, the first of three B-52A variants flew in August 1954 and were used exclusively for tests. The most famous of the test BUFFs was also a former B-52A, the NB-52A being permanently converted as a mothership for the X-15. It continued in this unique role until 1969.' Stephens told us that the paint scheme on the BUFF 'most closely resembles that of 52-0003 from 1959 with the X-15 mounted on the reinforced right pylon.' As it sits now, this B-52 with the boldest of heritage schemes will serve as the 49th Test and Evaluation Squadron's jet, doing very important work that will help allow the B-52 to remain relevant for decades to come, which is seen as critical to the service's future bomber roadmap. You can learn all about the B-52's future upgrades in our feature video below: We’ve reached out to both Tinker AFB and Barksdale AFB to find out more details about this aircraft. However, the next time you see a B-52 wearing DayGlo orange highlights, now you will know why.

Russian Pushes Deeper Into Key City In Eastern Ukraine	Russian troops have entered deeper into the embattled town of Vuhledar in eastern Ukraine according to the head of the Donetsk regional state administration and based on videos and photos posted by the Russians. Vuhledar has been an important bulwark against Russian advances in the region with its high ground and location between the eastern and southern fronts. Its fall, as we have previously reported, imperils the southern flank of Pokrovsk, a key regional logistics hub. 'The fighting is taking place within the city limits, so it is almost impossible to deliver humanitarian aid,' Vadym Filashkin, head of the Donetsk Regional State Administration said on Telegram Tuesday. '107 people still remain. Fortunately, all the children have already been evacuated from there.' Russian forces posted video and images of the tricolor flag waving atop a building there. Russian forces have advanced deeper inside Vuhledar to the most northwestern part of the city. In addition to our report yesterday, it is now quite safe to assume Ukraine no longer holds any presence inside Vuhledar. pic.twitter.com/e2xvuV5fsE&mdash; NOELREPORTS (@NOELreports) October 1, 2024 Russian channels posted videos showing the advance of Russian forces into western and southwestern Vuhledar, including elements from Russia's 5th Tank Brigade and 430th Motorized Rifle Regiment. pic.twitter.com/ggdmyoGelv&mdash; Rob Lee (@RALee85) September 30, 2024 As the Russians drew closer, Ukrainian troops said the only way out for soldiers still in the city late last week was on foot as they were hunted by drones and bombarded by artillery, The New York Times reported. 'There’s nowhere to hold ground,' one soldier from the 72nd Separate Mechanized Brigade, which has been defending Vuhledar, told the publication. 'The logistics are disrupted, making it almost impossible to stay there.' Beyond the strategic implications of losing Vuhledar are economic concerns. It was built atop two coal mines, where a significant amount of coal reserves remain, according to Reuters. Before the Russians entered Vuhledar, the brigade's commander said he was transferred to another unit. 'Gentlemen, officers, sergeants, soldiers! From the summer of 2022 to today, I had a long and difficult journey, Col. Ivan Vinnik wrote on the unit’s Telegram channel. 'But it was not difficult, because I did not overcome it alone. A loyal and motivated team was nearby.' Vinnik did not say where he was going or who would replace him. Col.

The past four months have been the deadliest of the war for Russian forces according to the U.K. Defense Ministry and its analysts say it is unclear how long they can sustain the current pace of operations. However, they have entered Vuhledar as they continue to chew up territory in a slow and deadly grind through Donetsk. The next weeks will tell us more about how much Ukrainian forces have buckled and how well they can defend the rest of the region, much of which does not have the same advantages of elevation and large buildings that provide some form of cover. The Latest The Russians appear to be continuing efforts to build out their defenses near the twice-attacked Kerch Bridge. New satellite imagery obtained by The War Zone shows the construction of what could be permanent barriers to the north and south of the bridge. In the upper portion of the image, you can see what looks like pilings driven into the seabed to create what could be a kind of fence to protect the bridge. There are two sections south of the bridge, one forming a line running east to the section of the span allowing shipping to pass through and another to the west of that opening. There is similar construction taking place north of the bridge. Nearly three dozen barges placed south of the bridge, lined up in two rows, are now in place as well, allowing a fairly narrow passage. It's also possible these new additions could be for another use, such as for a pipeline. Construction work on a possible barrier can be seen just south of the railway portion of the Kerch Bridge. There are also 34 barges set up in two rows to protect against sea drones. PHOTO © 2024 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION. A closer view of what could be barrier construction on either side of the Kerch Bridge. PHOTO © 2024 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION. An even closer view of what could be barrier construction to protect the Kerch Bridge. PHOTO © 2024 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION. If these are indeed barriers, they would be designed to stop Ukrainian uncrewed surface vessels (USV) from striking the bridge. It was severely damaged in July 2023 by a Ukrainian Sea Baby drone boat attack and before that by a truck bomb in October 2022. As we noted last week, Russia is also building flak towers near the bridge to house Pantsir air defense systems. You can see those towers in a video shot by someone crossing the bridge. Last year, the head of Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Directorate vowed that Vladimir Putin’s prized $4 billion span linking Russia to the Crimean peninsula it occupies will come down. 'It’s not a question of will we strike or won’t we strike,' Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov told us last year during an exclusive interview from his hotel room while he was visiting Washington, D.C. 'We’re doing that regularly so we will finish it. It’s just an issue of time.' Whether Budanov’s promise is fulfilled remains to be seen. However, the images potentially showing additional defensive lines being built around it is further evidence that Russia is taking that threat seriously. LATEST: On the battlefield, the heaviest fighting continues to take place in Ukraine’s Donetsk region while the invasion of Kursk Oblast in Russia grinds on, according to the latest assessment from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). Kursk: Ukrainian forces recently advanced in Glushkovsky Raion west of the Ukrainian salient while geolocated footage published on September 29 indicates that Ukrainian forces 'recently advanced west and northwest of Veseloye (south of Glushkovo) and likely seized the northwestern part of the settlement,' ISW reported.' Russian forces counterattacked near the Ukrainian salient in Kursk Oblast on September 29, but did not make any confirmed advances in the area.' Kharkiv Oblast: Russian forces continued offensive operations in northern Kharkiv Oblast on September 29 but did not make any confirmed advances. Luhansk Oblast: Russian forces continued offensive operations along the Kupyansk-Svatove-Kreminna line on September 29 but did not make any confirmed advances. Donetsk Oblast: Russian forces made no confirmed advances northeast of Siversk near Bilohorivka, east of Siversk near Verkhnokamyanske, and southeast of Siversk near Vyimka as well as in the Chasiv Yar direction and west of Donetsk City on September 29, including near Vuhledar. However, they 'recently marginally advanced in Toretsk amid continued assaults in the area on September 29' as well as southeast of Pokrovsk.

The latest planned increase in spending will take Russia’s defense budget to a record 13.5 trillion rubles ($145 billion) in 2025, according to draft budget documents published on Monday on the parliament’s website. That represents an increase of about 3 trillion rubles ($6 billion) more than was set aside for defense this year, which was the previous record, The Guardian noted All told, spending on defense and security 'will account for about 40% of Russia’s total government spending – or 41.5 trillion rubles in 2025,' the publication reported. That’s about $437 billion. The 2025 budget 'suggests Putin has embraced what economists have dubbed 'military Keynesianism', marked by a significant rise in military spending, which has fuelled the war in Ukraine, spurred a consumer spending boom and driven up inflation,' according to The Guardian. 40% of public spending in Russia will go to defense&#8230;If the West would take its own sanctions seriously, the Russian economy would tank in no time ! Guy Verhofstadt (@guyverhofstadt) October 1, 2024 Ukraine will receive a new tranche of U.S.-made GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs (SDBs) as part of a $6.9 billion sole-source contract awarded to Boeing. 'Work will be performed in St. Louis, Missouri, and is expected to be completed by Dec. 31, 2035,' according to the Pentagon. Bulgaria and Japan will also receive SDBs through this contract, though the Pentagon does not say how many will go to each country. @air_winged via X The 250-pound guided bombs with pop-out wings have a range of up to 40 nautical miles. Dropped by Ukrainian MiG-29 Fulcrum fighters, the SDBs have been used to great effect by Ukraine, which first disclosed it had begun employing them in May. They have 'proved resilient to jamming,' according to The Washington Post, in an article published in May citing confidential internal Ukrainian assessments. The same article notes that 'nearly 90 percent of dropped [Small Diameter Bombs] struck their target.' The War Zone has previously examined the potential for Ukraine to arm its donated F-16 fighters with SDBs, noting specifically the advantages the munitions provide in terms of accuracy, standoff range, ability to strike semi-hardened static targets, and the large numbers in NATO stockpiles to draw from. In contrast, the Ground Launched Small Diameter Bomb (GLSDB) variant of the weapon has been much less successful, and highly susceptible to jamming. Able to strike targets at a distance of around 94 miles, each GLSDB weapon combines the SDB with the rocket booster motor from a 227mm-caliber M26 artillery rocket that can also be fired by the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS and the M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS). Ukraine is one of three countries, along with Bulgaria and Japan, that will receive new tranches of Small Diameter Bombs. (U.S. Air Force photo/Master Sgt.

Iranian Ballistic Missiles Rain Down On Israel	Iran has begun its latest retaliation against Israel with a barrage of ballistic missiles. Information is only now starting to emerge, but there have been serious concerns that Iran may be poised to strike Israel in support of the Hezbollah militant group, of which it is the main sponsor, as well as in vengeance for the assassination of Hamas's top political leader in Tehran two months ago.

It also remains the case that Iran is yet to respond to the Israeli assassination of the Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh, killed in Tehran in a highly embarrassing incident for the Iranian leadership. #BREAKING: A senior official in the White House tells @BarakRavid: The US has intelligence that Iran intends to launch a missile attack against Israel in the immediate time frame ELINT News (@ELINTNews) October 1, 2024 Senior White House official: 'The United States has indications that Iran is preparing to imminently launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel.

This is one of at least 20 settlements that have received evacuation orders, others including Metula, Misgav Am, and Kfar Giladi in northern Israel. There are contradicting accounts from Hezbollah about the situation on the ground in the border area. One Hezbollah spokesperson told Reuters today that Israeli troops had not entered Lebanese territory, but that Hezbollah would be ready to fight them if they did. Meanwhile, two Lebanese security sources told the same agency that Israeli units had crossed into Lebanon overnight for reconnaissance and probing operations. There has been at least one claim from Hezbollah of its troops engaging IDF soldiers near the Lebanese border towns of Odaisseh and Kafr Kila, 'achieving confirmed casualties.' This has not been independently confirmed. Hezbollah’s deputy leader, Naim Qassem, yesterday said that 'the resistance forces are ready for a ground engagement.' In his first speech since the targeted killing of the group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, Qassem added: 'We know that the battle may be long. We will win as we won in the liberation of 2006,' he said, referring to the 2006 war.

Over the weekend, Lebanon’s health ministry said that more than 1,000 Lebanese have been killed and 6,000 wounded in the past two weeks, while a million people have fled their homes. Multiple casualties were reported after an Israeli strike that is said to have targeted a building at the Ain al-Hilweh refugee camp near the southern city of Sidon. An unconfirmed report from the Israeli media states that the attack injured Mounir Maqdah, the commander of the Lebanese branch of the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a Palestinian armed group active in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

However, this is by no means a new development, with Israeli concerns already having led to extensive measures being taken to curb the flow of weapons being transferred to Hezbollah from Iran. Israel continues to target these stockpiles aggressively and meanwhile, Hezbollah’s ability to use them has been hampered by Israeli operations that have inflicted heavy blows on the group’s communications and command and control networks. Israel’s long-awaited ground operation in Lebanon was approved by the country’s cabinet, according to Israeli media reports, after a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The buildup to the current IDF ground operation in Lebanon included the campaign of deadly explosions targeting pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah members two weeks ago and the airstrike last week that killed Hassan Nasrallah, in Beirut. The IAF has continued to strike targets in Beirut, as well as launching long-range attacks on Yemen and Syria. Over the weekend, dozens of IAF aircraft were involved in airstrikes on the Iran-backed Houthi militants in Yemen, which the Israeli military says is the longest-range combat mission since the 1985 raid on the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) headquarters in Tunis. You can read more about these latest Yemen airstrikes here. Today, the Houthis claimed they had launched drone strikes against IDF posts in Tel Aviv and Eilat. Meanwhile, in Syria, the official news agency Sana early today reported Israeli strikes in the Damascus area. The agency claimed that Syrian air defense systems had intercepted three rounds of strikes. Sana reported at least three civilians killed and nine others wounded in the attacks.

Still, the IAF has repeatedly launched attacks on Iran-linked targets in Syria for years, with a notable uptick after the start of the latest Middle East conflict in October last year. Israel has also revealed details of previously secret operations in the lead-up to Northern Arrows, including efforts to locate and destroy weapons belonging to the Radwan Force, the special operation units of Hezbollah. Since the beginning of the year, the IDF says its special forces have carried out around 70 operations into southern Lebanon, resulting in the capture of 30 tons of explosives, thousands of weapons including advanced anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles made in Russia, Iran, and China, heavy machine guns, ammunition, and more. Most of these are said to have been taken from Hezbollah’s extensive network of tunnels and basements near the border. הותר לפרסום: כוחות מיוחדים של צה'ל ביצעו מתחילת השנה כ-70 מבצעים חשאיים בדרום לבנון, לאיתור והשמדת יכולות רדואן של חיזבאללה.מעל ל-30 טונות חומרי נפץ, אלפי אמצעי לחימה ובהם טילי נ'ט ונ'מ מתקדמים מתוצרת רוסיה, איראן וסין, קלאצ'ים, מקלעים בהם כבדים, מצלמות, תצ'אות ומפות מעודכנות,… pic.twitter.com/k5htGldxBe&mdash; יואב זיתון (@yoavzitun) October 1, 2024 Ever since Israel said it was committed to returning to their homes the thousands of its citizens who fled Hezbollah rockets near the northern border, the expectation has been that a ground operation would be launched. Before its people can return to homes in the border area, Hezbollah’s ability to use short-range rockets, mortars, drones, anti-tank missiles, and snipers first needs to be severely degraded. In recent weeks, Hezbollah has been rocked by Israeli decapitation operations and airstrikes that have already greatly reduced its fighting potential, but it remains to be seen how long it will take Israel to achieve its goal and at what cost to both sides, as well as the Lebanese civilian population.

Israeli Ground Offensive In Lebanon Has Begun: Reports	Detailed information is currently scarce, but there are now numerous reports that Israel has launched a new ground operation in Lebanon. The scale of this remains to be seen, with accounts earlier today of several small-scale raids across the border into Lebanon. For some months now, a larger Israeli operation in Lebanon had been expected, with Israeli officials apparently recently telling their U.S. counterparts that a 'limited' ground operation was about to begin.

Meanwhile, at least one U.S. official has said that Israel appeared to be planning a major ground invasion, but that the plan now appears to have been 'significantly scaled down.' There were also reports earlier today suggesting that Israel may not yet have made a final decision on a broader operation. Meanwhile, there are eyewitness accounts, videos, and photos posted to social media that show the rapidly ballooning deployment of Israel Defense Forces (IDF) units — including tanks and armored fighting vehicles — close to the border with Lebanon. Around a hundred vehicles, including Merkava tanks and Namer armored personnel carriers, are visible in visuals from this spot near Ayelet HaShahar in northern Israel, about 8km from Lebanon. Reuters, NYT, Getty all have photos from the site (credits in ALT text). pic.twitter.com/gb62Ru8X1u&mdash; Christiaan Triebert (@trbrtc) September 30, 2024 The IDF has declared the areas around the communities of Metula, Misgav Am, and Kfar Giladi in northern Israel, near the border with Lebanon, as a 'closed military zone.' Entry to areas around those areas is now prohibited, the IDF has said. Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant said today that the 'next phase of the war against Hezbollah will begin soon,' while in separate comments he told troops in the north of the country that 'we will use all of our capabilities — including you.' The Lebanese Army appears to have made the conclusion that an Israeli ground offensive is more likely than not. There are now plenty of reports indicating that Lebanese troops are withdrawing from the border area close to Israel. Citing local residents and security sources, Reuters reports that the Lebanese military is pulling back from 'several positions on the southern border with Israel,' although a Lebanese Army spokesperson would neither confirm nor deny such reports. A Lebanese security source told Reuters that Lebanese troops have pulled back to at least three miles north of the border, while another source talked of the troops having been pulled back to larger army bases in the area.

Sept 30 (Reuters) - The Lebanese Army was seen withdrawing from several positions on the southern border with Israel, local residents and a security source told Reuters.&mdash; Idrees Ali (@idreesali114) September 30, 2024 For its part, Hezbollah has been launching rockets into Israel from the border area in recent days, while Lebanon came under heavy Israeli aerial attack. On Friday, Israeli airstrikes on Beirut killed Hassan Nasrallah, the veteran leader of Hezbollah, and much of the group's leadership. You can read our coverage of this decapitation strike here. While Hezbollah says it will continue to fight Israel, the fighting potential of the group has been severely degraded in the past couple of weeks. Israeli decapitation operations, including exploding pagers and walkie-talkies, as well as airstrikes, have removed not only Nasrallah but also many of his associates. Key facilities housing Hezbollah weaponry and personnel have also been relentlessly struck. The success of these operations may well be reflected in the scale of the ground offensive that looks set to follow. Another key factor is Israel’s stated plan to return tens of thousands of Israelis who had been evacuated from towns along the northern border with Lebanon when Hezbollah stepped up its campaign of rocket attacks. With the return of these evacuees having been approved by Israeli officials, a major military operation against the militant group began to look much more likely. The U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, and other senior U.S. officials have been monitoring and responding to 'unfolding events in the Middle East' over the weekend, according to Matthew Miller, a U.S. State Department spokesperson. Miller today said he will let Israel 'speak to its own military operations', including the 'timing, purpose, tempo of those' operations. Whatever shape those operations take, it now appears more likely than not that the conflict in the Middle East has reached a critical new juncture. This is a developing story. We will update it as more news comes in about this apparent new offensive.

Mysterious M60 Machine Gun Contract Awarded By U.S. Army	The U.S. Army has awarded a contract worth nearly $15 million to U.S. Ordnance for an unspecified number of 7.62x51mm M60E6 and M60E4 machine guns, and/or kits to convert older M60s into either of those configurations, as well as ancillary items and training. The service announced its interest in buying these guns, which the U.S. military largely stopped using decades ago, earlier this year, but was curiously tight-lipped about for whom and why. The weapons could be intended for a foreign ally or partner, such as Ukraine, or to support some other operational, test and evaluation, or training requirements. The Pentagon included the new deal with U.S. Ordnance for 'M60E4 and M60E6 machine guns, spare parts and accessories, conversion kits, and training,' which is valued at $14,960,325 and came via the Army's Contracting Command-New Jersey (CCNJ), in its daily contracting announcement last Monday. 'Work locations and funding will be determined with each order, with an estimated completion date of Sept. 21, 2029,' the Pentagon's notice adds without elaborating on who might be the intended recipient of the guns. Neither the M60E4 nor the M60E6 are known to be in any kind of widespread Army service currently. A member of the Danish armed forces with an M60E6 machine gun. US Army In January, CCNJ posted a sources sought notice about an essentially identical potential purchase of M60E4/E6s and/or conversion kits, as well as associated items and services. That notice also asked prospective contractors to 'describe your maximum deliverable quantity of all the above M60 systems and conversion kits within 60 days' and indicated a desire for up to 500 guns, at least within that timeline. The notice added that the requirement for the guns came from the office of the Program Manager for Soldier Lethality (PM SL) and the Combat Capabilities Development Command-Armaments Center (CCDC-AC), but did not provide more specific details about who would be receiving the weapons or why they were needed. 'PM SL is prohibited from releasing details that may violate operational security,' a spokesperson for that office told The War Zone in January when asked about the purpose of the then-proposed acquisition and who might be set to get the M60s. 'Please contact OSD(PA) [Office of the Secretary of Defense Public Affairs] for announcements of DoD support activities and force posture changes related to Ukraine,' that same individual said when asked about whether the M60s might be part of a future military assistance package for that country. 'OSD(PA) retains release authority for announcements of DoD support activities and force posture changes related to Ukraine.' 'Beyond the information reflected in the contract notice, we do not have any additional details to release at this time,' a spokesperson for the Office of the Secretary of Defense also told The War Zone in January. The War Zone has reached back out to PM SL and OSD for more information now that a contract has been awarded. A member of the US Army fires an M60E6 machine gun during training with Danish and other NATO allied forces in Estonia in 2018. US Army The Army started development of the original M60 in-house in the late 1940s, leveraging design elements from Nazi Germany's FG-42 automatic rifle and MG-42 machine gun. The service adopted the M60 in the 1950s, fielding it as a weapon that could be used by dismounted infantry, as well as mounted on various platforms. More specific subvariants intended for internal and external use on vehicles, helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, and ships and boats were subsequently developed. These early Cold War variants of the M60 were widely exported. Decades-long efforts to lighten and otherwise improve the core design resulted in the M60E3 variant in the 1980s. Empty with a standard 22-inch barrel, the E3 weighed just under 19 pounds compared to the nearly 23-pound standard infantry model of the M60. Even lighter and more compact E3s fitted with short 16.6-inch 'assault' length barrels became particularly associated with the U.S. Navy SEALs, as well as a fixture in popular media like 1985's Rambo: First Blood Part II. A US Navy SEAL with a short-barrelled M60E3. DOD However, the changes to the E3 resulted in reliability and other issues. The M60E4 was designed to rectify those problems and further improve the design, and had a weight of around 23 pounds like the original infantry variant when fitted with a standard-length barrel. This version competed against and lost to what became the Army's now-standard M240B machine gun in the 1990s. The SEALs, as well as other Navy units, subsequently adopted a subvariant of the E4 with a short 17.3-inch barrel, which was designated the Mk 43 Mod 0. Another variant with rails for mounting optics, aiming lasers, and other accessories on the gun's top cover and handguard was developed and became the Mk 43 Mod 1. The Mk 48 machine gun, a 7.62x51mm cousin of the 5.56x45mm M249 Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW), has since supplanted the Mk 43 series. U.S. Ordnance, the main manufacturer of M60 variants today, treats the M60E4 and the Mk 43 series as functionally identical. A member of a US Navy Naval Mobile Construction Battalion, or Seabee, mans a Mk 43 Mod 0 machine gun mounted on a Humvee in Iraq in 2003. DOD Though they have not enjoyed the same success export-wise as the original M60, M60E4/Mk 43-series guns, as well as E3 variants, have also made their way into service with military and security forces outside of the United States. The Philippines Marine Corps and that country's Naval Special Operations Command are particularly prominent examples. In the early 2010s, U.S. Ordnance introduced the M60E6 with further improvements and reduced weight (around 20 and a half pounds with a standard-length barrel) over the M60E4/Mk 43. The Danish Army became the first customer for this new M60 variant in 2014. M60E6s are also now in service in the Philippines and Indonesia. A Philippine Naval Special Operations Command with what appears to be an M60E6 during an exercise with US forces in 2024. USN Petty Officer 1st Class Joseph Rolfe It remains possible the Army's new M60 purchases are part of a forthcoming military aid package for Ukraine. The U.S. military likely has substantial numbers of older M60s in storage readily available for conversion into E4/E6 types, as well, which could then be transferred to the Ukrainian armed forces. After the U.S. government said last year that it had run out of funds for more military aid for Ukraine, the Excess Defense Articles (EDA) program was raised as one option for keep assistance flowing. Under EDA, materiel that meets certain stipulations to be deemed excess to U.S. military requirements can be sold very cheaply or transferred via a grant to foreign allies and partners. Other current and former operators around the world, including many NATO members, could be sources for older M60s for conversion to newer variants, as well. The Army's new M60 contract could have nothing to do with Ukraine, as well. The guns could be for an entity within the Army or elsewhere inside the U.S. government, or some other foreign ally or partner. As previously discussed, M60E4/E6 types are already in service elsewhere outside of the United States. It is worth noting that the Army was able to respond without issue to questions about a similarly unusual potential purchase of Soviet-designed 5.45x39mm AK-74 assault rifles, or certain variations thereof, last year. As it turned out, the service was interested in acquiring those guns to meet an internal training-related requirement. With the contract for the M60E4/E6s now awarded, more details about where they are headed and how they will be used might begin to emerge.

Israeli 707 Tanker’s Secretive Remote Vision System Revealed In L...	The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have released a video showing portions of the long-range strike mission flown against Houthi targets in Yemen yesterday. The footage confirms that F-35I Adir stealth jets as well as F-15C/D fighters were involved in the attacks, part of an intensified campaign that Israel is now waging against the Iran-backed Houthis, as well as Hezbollah in Lebanon, and Hamas in Gaza. Intriguingly, the video also provides what is very likely our best (if not only) view so far of the little-known remote vision system used in the Israeli Air Force’s Boeing 707 tanker, seen while topping up F-35s over the Red Sea. Footage From the Refueling Aircraft on the Way to Strike Houthi Military Targets in YemenThe Israeli Air Force's refueling aircraft have been operating in all arenas in the war, providing fighter jets with flexibility in strikes and aerial operations at any distance.Yesterday… pic.twitter.com/o8TRNAtC8l&mdash; Israeli Air Force (@IAFsite) September 30, 2024 The video published today by the IDF shows aerial refueling operations as part of the strike against infrastructure in Yemen used by the Iran-backed Houthi militants. The footage starts with the takeoff of an IAF 707 tanker including views from the flight deck, after which the refueling jet flies in formation with F-35s. A portion of the Saudi Arabian coastline, including the city of Al Humidah can also be seen, from the perspective of the tanker. As for the F-35s, these appear to be carrying exclusively internal ordnance and they are not fitted with radar-reflective Luneburg lenses which remove the stealth jet’s radar-evading qualities.

We got a previous view of the screen of the remote vision system back in July of this year when the 707 supported F-35s in another long-range IAF raid on Yemen. But on that occasion, it was just video from the camera feed itself, not of the actual boomer interface that controls the system. בהמשך לתקיפות בלבנון ביממה האחרונה, מצורף תיעוד מתדלוק מטוסי אדיר מעל שמי לבנון ותיעוד מיירוט כטב״ם על-ידי מסוק קרב: pic.twitter.com/YUul4bCMVs&mdash; Israeli Air Force (@IAFsite) August 25, 2024 Essentially, the equipment used on the Israeli 707 is a much earlier conceptualization of the technology now used on the U.S. Air Force’s KC-46 Pegasus. In this more recent application, however, the complex Remote Vision System (RVS) has proven to be a particular source of problems. In both the Israeli 707 and the KC-46, the boom operator performs their tasks from the main cabin via an array of cameras at the back of the plane that feeds into the RVS. In both cases, a hybrid 2D/3D system is used, requiring the operators to wear special glasses. Boom operators sit at their workstations wearing their specialized glasses in the main cabin of a KC-46A. U.S. Air Force A largely unprecedented view of the Re'em's RVS. (IDF screencap) Perhaps the most surprising facet of this is that Israel developed and fielded a remote vision system that seems to function without any lingering difficulties, and did so many years ago, while the U.S. version used in the KC-46 is still mired in delays. We still don't know exactly how bad the teething of this older Israeli system was when it was introduced many years ago. Another modern remote vision system has meanwhile also been developed and introduced by Airbus, on the A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT). An Israeli Air Force Boeing 707 tanker demonstrates refueling hookups with F-15 fighters over Hatzerim Air Base. JACK GUEZ/AFP via Getty Images Israel has a limited number of 707 aerial refueling jets. (JACK GUEZ/AFP via Getty Images) As well as aerial refueling, the 707 used in the Yemen raid will likely also have served as a command and control station and communications node. The aircraft is equipped with a satellite communications suite ensuring critical, secure beyond-line-of-sight comms with appropriately equipped tactical aircraft like the F-15 and F-16 and command centers far away. This is especially important in long-range strike operations, with the 707 helping enable real-time remote command and control and enhanced situational awareness, intelligence sharing, and other functions. In this way, targeting information, for example, can be shared between all the aircraft on the active network and can be exchanged with command centers and other aircraft across considerable distances. Some Israeli Air Force 707 tankers also execute other missions, including networking and command and control functions. Tomás Del Coro/Wikicommons Some IAF 707 tankers also execute other missions, including networking and command and control functions. Tomás Del Coro — wikicommons The current IAF 707 fleet started to enter service in 1979, with then-newer 707-300 airframes replacing previous 707-100s. Known by the Hebrew name Re’em, meaning oryx, the aircraft were acquired from commercial airlines and then began to be adapted locally for aerial refueling. The conversion was done by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) and was a long process, only finally being completed in the 2010s. Details about the current remote vision system are hard to come by and technical details have been relatively closely guarded. Reportedly, as well as the 3D glasses, the system incorporates a foot-operated communications system, meaning the boomer’s hands are kept free to operate the console. Otherwise, based on what we can see in the video, the boomer’s screen is surrounded by very dated-looking analog instruments, reflecting the overall age of the interface installation. Israel's 707 tankers, thought to number roughly just seven airframes or so, are absolutely prized possessions for the IAF. They enable long-range strike capabilities that have allowed Israel to reach out over long distances to prosecute high-priority targets since the 1980s. They would be absolutely critical players in even a limited air operation against Iran, not just providing fuel, but also aforementioned networking and command and control capabilities. Ultimately, the IAF will replace its geriatric 707 fleet with KC-46s, with a deal for eight of the new tankers having been approved. We don’t yet know when Israel will receive its first KC-46s, but by the time they arrive, they should have a fully functional RVS, with the 2.0 version of the system expected to be delivered starting in April 2026. Other interesting details of the latest raid on Yemen have been provided in other videos and photos from the IDF. Yesterday, another video released by the IDF revealed details of preparations by an IAF strike package consisting of F-15C/Ds, known locally as Baz, which were seen taking off from their base at Tel Nof, in central Israel, purportedly headed for Yemen. These venerable fighters, which have a dual air defense and strike role, were seen fitted with conformal fuel tanks and loaded with 2,204-pound SPICE 1000 precision-guided glide-bombs, as well as AIM-7 Sparrow and AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air missiles, and Elta 8222 self-escort electronic warfare pods. Also in the video are 2,000-pound Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM), although these are not seen fitted on the jets. המראת מטוסי ה-״בז״ (F-15) לתימן מבסיס תל נוף pic.twitter.com/uQfk6ysDIB&mdash; Israeli Air Force (@IAFsite) September 29, 2024 Live 2,000-pound JDAMs lined up in front of an Israeli Air Force F-15 in its shelter. IAF screencap While the AIM-7 is an increasingly anachronistic weapon, TWZ has previously explored the continued use of this missile to arm IAF F-15s, noting that the older Sparrow has a warhead that is double the size of the one used in the AMRAAM. However, the AMRAAM still possesses far superior range, is far more flexible overall, better allows for fighters to engage multiple targets at once, and has a true fire-and-forget capability, making it sensible to carry examples of both. On the other hand, the threat posed by Houthi fighters is strictly limited, with little chance that they would risk taking on the IAF, provided they had the opportunity to do so. In certain scenarios, the Sparrow is likely also more suitable for engaging hostile drones — not least due to the fact that it’s a cheaper option and stocks may be close to becoming time-expired.

Despite losing almost all its starboard wing, the fighter landed safely, was repaired, and has been in frontline IAF service ever since.

Muyovu (@kirkjamestkirk) September 30, 2024 The fact that the aging F-15C/D still plays a key role within the IAF is something we have explored in the past and it has also helped influence continued interest in procuring new versions of the F-15, alongside the fifth-generation F-35. Meanwhile, these heavily modified F-15s are central to the air arm’s ability to conduct long-range operations as well as homeland defense and they have been used as multirole air-to-air and air-to-ground platforms for decades. According to the IDF, 'dozens' of aircraft were involved in the Yemen airstrikes on Sunday, which the Israeli military says are its longest-range combat mission since the 1985 raid on the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) headquarters in Tunis — a mission that also involved F-15s. According to the IAF, its aircraft flew upward of 1,120 miles to attack the Houthi targets yesterday. As well as one or more 707 tankers, these 'dozens' of IAF aircraft would have included the strike and escort packages of F-35s and F-15s and a variety of intelligence-gathering assets, almost certainly including some of the airborne early warning and control and signals intelligence platforms based on the Gulfstream bizjet airframe. The latest of these is the Nachshon Oron, a multi-mission intelligence-gathering aircraft that you can read more about here.

The focus of yesterday’s attacks appears to have been the ports of Hodeidah and Ras Issa, with targets including the docks as well as fuel facilities and powerplants. Israeli authorities say that the ports are being used to 'transfer Iranian weapons to the region, and supplies for military needs, and thus also oil.'

Residents described power cuts across most of Hodeidah. IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi released a statement after the strike: 'We know how to reach very far, we know how to reach even farther, and we know how to strike there with precision.' 'This is not a message; it is an action. An action that carries a message with it,' Halevi added. In an unusual move, the IDF flew a CNN journalist, Nic Robertson, aboard the 707 during yesterday’s mission. During the flight, an IDF spokesperson said that the strikes were in response to the Houthis firing three long-range missiles against Israel in the past two weeks; all of those missiles were intercepted near Tel Aviv, the spokesperson said. According to the Houthis, the most recent of these attacks, on Saturday, targeted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Ben Gurion International Airport, outside Tel Aviv, as he arrived back from a visit to the United States.

You can read our coverage of those attacks here. The United States has meanwhile confirmed suspicions that versions of the 2,000-pound GBU-31 JDAM were used to strike Beirut. Senator Mark Kelly, the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Air-Land said that U.S.-made 'Mark 84' bombs equipped with JDAM kits. 'We see more use of guided munitions, JDAMs, and we continue to provide those weapons,' Kelly said on NBC. 'That 2,000-pound bomb that was used, that’ s a Mark 84 series bomb, to take out Nasrallah.' The bombs used were BLU-109s, which is a penetrating bunker-buster warhead, or variant of them, also with a nominal weight of 2,000 pounds. In the wake of the raids that killed Nasrallah, the IAF released videos and photos showing at least eight F-15I strike fighters carrying 2,000-pound-class penetrator JDAMs. At least some of those aircraft carried seven of the JDAMs each.

The group said that one of those targeted a group of Israeli soldiers, while others reportedly struck areas in northern Israel, according to officials there. Despite the death of Nasrallah and the vast majority of its upper echelons in recent Israeli attacks, Hezbollah says it will continue to fight Israel. Since the start of the Gaza war, almost a year ago, there have been concerns that fighting between Israel and Hezbollah could draw in Iran, and other Iran-backed proxies, sparking a larger regional conflict. It seems that yesterday’s long-range strike mission against the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen was not only intended to degrade the militants’ ability to attack Israel but was also a very clear warning to Iran not to become more deeply involved. Whatever happens next, the operations so far have revealed some fascinating and surprising aspects of Israeli capabilities, from exploding pagers on the one hand to our best look at the remote vision system on Israel’s veteran 707 tankers on the other.

Russia Training To Launch FPV Drones From Helicopters To Counter ...	Russia is now training its troops to use helicopters to launch first-person view (FPV) drones to counter Ukraine’s uncrewed surface vessels (USVs). New video released by the Russian Tactical_13 Telegram channel is the first time we have seen Russians using a helicopter this way. The video shows one Russian donning the FPV goggles while another grabs an FPV drone, opens the door, and lets it out over the water. The operator’s view shows the drone flying low over the surface, but no USV in sight. Because, why not: Special Forces of the Russian Black Sea Fleet training to destroy kamikaze USVs from helicopter using FPV drones. pic.twitter.com/Y34I8jFtP6&mdash; Clash Report (@clashreport) September 30, 2024 Using a helicopter as a FPV drone mothership in this way makes a lot of sense. You can greatly expand the reach of FPV drones by delivering them forward via a mothership aircraft. Generally, the FPV drones have a maximum range of about a dozen miles, but operationally usually it's much less than that. They require continuous line-of-sight communications with their controllers. However, their range can be maximized by avoiding terrain that can interfere with their signal. Elevated antennas and relays installed on balloons or placed on unmanned or manned aircraft, like a helicopter, can extend their connectivity much further with more consistent connectivity. You can read all about this in our previous piece here. FPV drone mothership/relay concept of operations. (Tyler Rogoway) In this case, the helicopter is both the delivery system and the control node. Operating over water and having the controller well above the surface in a helicopter means that the absolute maximum range and flexibility can be squeezed out of these drones. This also fits with a broader move to more advanced 'air launched effects' drones that are launched by a mothership aircraft, but this cruder version of the concept makes realizing even a basic capability like this much more attainable. FPV drones are capable of hunting for USVs, popularly known as drone boats, while also acting as precision-guided munitions nimble enough to chase them down and destroy them, although it’s always harder than it looks. Using helicopters to launch FPVs is another iteration in the development of drone combat in this war, where FPV drones have dominated the battlefield. Aerial suicide drones have been used to attack boats before, so it makes sense that Russia has moved to the maritime interdiction environment focusing on countering Ukrainian long-range drone boat attacks. Launching FPV drones from helicopters would allow Russia to cover wide swaths of the Black Sea. Being able to strike Ukrainian sea drones before they can get close to a port or ships is far preferable to relying on close-in weapons from a vessel or shore defenses, booms, and other impediments in a port. The following video shows Ukrainian drone boats being blown up in Sevastopol harbor. #war Another video of the breakthrough ofdrones on Sevastopol harbor in the early morning of March 22. One of them was stopped by a booms at the entrance to the harbor and exploded. Two others managed to jump over the booms and they were destroyed already in the harbor. pic.twitter.com/3bWHShWwEx&mdash; Capt(N) (@Capt_Navy) March 23, 2023 Russia has used FPV drones to attack Ukrainian sea drones before. What was purported to be the first recorded instance of that emerged in May, which you can read more about here. It was unclear whether video from the time showed an attack on an operational or captured Ukrainian USV. However, the head of Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR), Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, told us at the time that Russia had been using FPV drones to attack Ukrainian drone boats for several months. You can see video of that encounter below. Launching and controlling them via helicopter will allow for responding faster to these threats much farther out then using FPV drones launched from land or vessels. Unfortunately, Russians are using FPV drones to destroy Ukrainian naval drones It is unclear when and where the encounter happened, pic.twitter.com/HyTVaJOnxH&mdash; PS01 △ (@PStyle0ne1) May 29, 2024 The use of helicopters to defend against Ukrainian drone boats is a well established tactic. The War Zone first reported in May that the Russian Defense Ministry (MoD) released video it said was an R-73-equipped Ukrainian USV coming under attack from a Russian Navy Ka-29 Helix-B assault helicopter. The USV performed some hard maneuvers to try and escape the Ka-29 but was eventually destroyed, apparently by gunfire. At major suspected target areas, including ports and infrastructure, helicopters are used by the Russians to spot and engage marauding drone boats. Ukraine’s sea drones have caused widespread havoc on Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, with attacks on ports in Crimea and ships. They have been so devastating that Russia has moved the bulk of its BSF from Crimea to Novorossysk in Russia. Ukrainian Sea Baby drones were used to attack the Kerch Bridge in July 2023. These attacks have served as a lesson in asymmetrical warfare, where one side with an extremely limited navy can pin down a much larger force with numerous surface and subsurface combatants. It is natural that Russia would seek to change this equation by doing for the Black Sea what FPV drones have done for ground warfare in Ukraine and Russia. Launching FPVs and controlling them from a helicopter overhead is also likely to quickly migrate far beyond the conflict in Ukraine, with special operations aircrews are already using and perusing similar concepts but with higher-end weapons, many of which offer less flexibility than the FPV drone does, at least over short distances, and cost far more per round. But in the meantime, we will have to watch to see if Russia finds success with this new FPV drone application. Considering how this war has progressed, we will likely find out sooner rather than later.

Russian Su-35 Shown ‘Headbutting’ American F-16 At Very Close Ran...	North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) has posted a video of an 18th Fighter Interceptor Squadron (18th FIS) F-16C executing an intercept on a pair of Russian Tu-95MS Bear-Hs and their fighter escorts off Alaska. The video in question shows a Su-35S Flanker executing a very close-range 'headbutting' maneuver, cutting in front of and across the Viper's path. It's the most dramatic video we have seen of such a close encounter since a B-52 crew experienced a similar incident over the Black Sea a few years ago. The video posted by NORAD, taken by a 360-degree action cam placed in the F-16's cockpit, shows how alarmed the Viper pilot was with the Su-35's maneuver: 'On Sept 23, 2024, NORAD aircraft flew a safe and disciplined intercept of Russian Military Aircraft in the Alaska ADIZ. The conduct of one Russian Su-35 was unsafe, unprofessional, and endangered all – not what you’d see in a professional air force.' – Gen. Gregory Guillot pic.twitter.com/gXZj3Ndkag&mdash; North American Aerospace Defense Command (@NORADCommand) September 30, 2024 The original press release from September 23 about the intercept noted four Russian aircraft were involved: 'The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) detected and tracked four Russian military aircraft operating in the Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) on September 23, 2024. The Russian aircraft remained in international airspace and did not enter American or Canadian sovereign airspace. This Russian activity in the Alaska ADIZ occurs regularly and is not seen as a threat. An ADIZ begins where sovereign airspace ends and is a defined stretch of international airspace that requires the ready identification of all aircraft in the interest of national security. NORAD employs a layered defense network of satellites, ground-based and airborne radars and fighter aircraft to track aircraft and inform appropriate actions. NORAD remains ready to employ a number of response options in defense of North America.' Unprofessional & dangerous conduct by a VKS Su-35S (B/N '24' Blue / RF-95493) assigned to the 22nd Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment (based at Tsentralnaya Uglovaya, Primorsky Krai). Guy Plopsky (@GuyPlopsky) September 30, 2024 It's worth noting that the 18th Fighter Interceptor Squadron is unique in the U.S. Air Force. As we previously reported, the unit was previously designated the 18th Aggressor Squadron (18th AGRS) but was redesigned the 18th FIS earlier this year. This occurred after performing the alert air sovereignty mission to backfill F-22 Raptors based out of Elmendorf Air Force Base in Anchorage for some time. The growing demand for F-22 taskings around the globe resulted in the aggressors based to the north at Eielson AFB increasingly standing in for the Raptors in an alert augmentation role. This led to some very interesting situations where F-16s wearing Russian-like camouflage would be intercepting real Russian aircraft, usually over the Bering Sea. While some of the unit's F-16s now wear a standard scheme, others do not and still partake in the alert missions. As it sits now, the 18th FIS performs both aggressor missions and alert taskings on a regular basis, making it unlike any other unit in the force.

U.S. Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Carson Jeney Airman 1st Class Carson Jeney As for the 'headbutt' maneuver, as we have reported on for many years, while deemed unprofessional at very close ranges, these types of antics have gone on for decades, being wholly commonplace during the depths of the Cold War. They have taken on new meaning and become more prolific in recent years as the global security situation shifted for the worse, with Russia and the United States, as well as many of its allies, being directly opposed to one another over the war in Ukraine. China is also notorious for executing similar stunts that have also included actually dumping radar-reflecting chaff into the path of the targeted aircraft, which raises major safety concerns. That being said, the USAF uses the 'headbutt' maneuver to gain the attention of wayward aircraft as well, but not in such an aggressive manner. As for Russia's activity near Alaska, it has spiked in recent months alongside that of China, which is now extending its power-projection capabilities in the air and at sea, with Alaska being a major focus. This included the first flight of Chinese H-6 cruise missile carriers off Alaskan shores and an increased Russian-Chinese naval presence in the area. This has prompted the U.S. Defense Department to allocate more resources to the highly strategic area, including sending naval assets there to keep a close eye on and deter Russian and Chinese air and naval operations, which are spiking as of late. With the Arctic being of increasingly great importance, tensions between Russia and the United States climbing, and China becoming more comfortable with long-range military operations, the 18th FIS and their F-22s partners are likely to be busier than ever in the coming months and years.

Russians Advancing On Kharkiv Region City Ukraine Liberated In 20...	While most of the heavy fighting in Ukraine is concentrated in the Donetsk region, Russia continues to push toward the city of Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast. Located about 60 miles east of Kharkiv City, it is a regional administrative headquarters and sits astride a key railway. Russian forces are now less than five miles to the northeast and less than 10 miles to the southeast. The Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff reported 20 battles in the area on Friday and claimed its forces repelled Russian advance attempts on the nearby towns of Sinkivka, Glushkivka, Lozova, Stelmakhivka and Kolisnikivka.

It rushed troops from the Donbas to defend it, leaving that region more exposed. Back in September 2022, Ukraine liberated Kupiansk as part of its stunning and successful offensive in that region. It was a high point for the nation a half-year after Russia launched its all-out invasion. While its fall does not appear imminent, the fact that Kupiansk is again under siege is another troubling sigh of Ukraine's hard-fought gains being eroded. The Latest Elsewhere on the battlefield, Russian forces continue to push forward in eastern Ukraine, where towns like Pokrovsk, Toretsk and Vuhledar remain in peril. According to the Institute for the Study of War’s (ISW) latest assessment, Russian forces ' recently advanced east and southeast of Pokrovsk amid continued offensive operations near Pokrovsk on September 26.' Ukrainian forces 'maintain positions in Vuhledar and Kostyantynivka amid continued Russian offensive operations southwest of Donetsk City on September 26. The Ukrainian brigade defending in Vuhledar reported that Ukrainian forces are maintaining positions in the settlement in response to recent Western reporting to the contrary.' In Kharkiv Oblast, Russian forces 'recently reportedly made marginal advances north of Kharkiv City, but there were no confirmed changes to the frontline' in the northern part of that region on September 26.

During a pre-meeting press conference, Trump once again said he could end the war in Ukraine and that he has good relations with both Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Standing next to Zelensky, Trump said he’s ready to work out a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, CNN noted, emphasizing his good relationship with Putin. 'So, we’re going to sit down (to) just discuss it, and if we have a win, I think long before I, before January 20, before I would take the presidency – it’s January 20 – but long before that, I think that we can work out something that’s good for both sides. It’s time,' Trump added. 'By the way, the president (Zelensky) knows that too. He wants to get something done. He doesn’t want to do this.' 'I think we have common view that the war in Ukraine has to be stopped, and Putin can’t win, and Ukraine has to prevail, and I want to discuss with you the details about that,' Zelensky said. The meeting took place even after Trump, openly skeptical about providing additional aid to Ukraine, mocked Zelensky. While Zelensky has yet to release the plan, it is said to include requests for ongoing Ukrainian security guarantees as well for additional long-range weapons and the permission to use them deep in Russia. After the meeting, Zelensky expressed gratitude toward Trump, calling their meeting 'very productive.' He added that the two men 'thoroughly reviewed' the situation in Ukraine and the consequences of the war for Ukrainians. I had a very productive meeting with @realDonaldTrump.

During a meeting of the Russian Federation Security Council standing conference on nuclear deterrence, Putin announced a draft proposal for changes to his country’s nuclear doctrine. It includes the possibility of using nuclear weapons in the event of a massive launch of non-nuclear weapons against Russia. He did not mention Ukraine but inferred that actions taken by Kyiv and its allies could push Moscow over the nuclear threshold. 'The updated version of the document is supposed to regard an aggression against Russia from any non-nuclear state but involving or supported by any nuclear state as their joint attack against the Russian Federation,' Putin said. The proposal also 'states clearly the conditions for Russia’s transition to the use of nuclear weapons.' Under the plan, Russia will consider using nuclear weapons 'once we receive reliable information about a massive launch of air and space attack weapons and their crossing our state border. I mean strategic and tactical aircraft, cruise missiles, UAVs, hypersonic and other aircraft.' Russia reserves 'the right to use nuclear weapons in the event of aggression against Russia and Belarus as a member of the Union State. All these issues have been agreed upon with the Belarusian side and the President of Belarus. Including the case when the enemy, using conventional weapons, creates a critical threat to our sovereignty.' 'In conclusion,' Putin said, ' I will note that all the updates have been deeply calibrated and are measured against contemporary military threats and risks to the Russian Federation.' Putin suggests changes to Russia's nuclear doctrine.'An aggression by a non-nuclear state with the participation of a nuclear state is proposed to be considered as their joint attack on Russia,' Putin said during a Security Council meeting. The Kyiv Independent (@KyivIndependent) September 25, 2024 One analyst suggested that Putin's announcement falls between 'cheap talk' and 'state-sponsored rhetoric.'

Umerov noted that Ukraine is currently discussing the necessary number of air brigades and fighter jets, according to a translation by The New Voice of Ukraine. Umerov also emphasized that while last year’s focus was on pilot training and building the required infrastructure, this year the priority is to 'secure air superiority.' 'We already have commitments from partners for the F-16s. Consultations are ongoing regarding the Gripen and Eurofighter,' Umerov said. As we previously reported, Sweden is keeping the door open for a possible transfer of Gripens, allocating $220 million in a recent aid package to Ukraine to purchase new 'material kits' for its operational JAS-39C/D Gripen fighters. That’s so those jets won’t have to be cannibalized for parts to be used in the newer Gripen-JAS-39E variants, making them potentially available to Ukraine.

Plans To Axe Special Operations Surveillance Planes Come Under Th...	How U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) expects to fill the capability and capacity gaps that will be created by the planned retirement of U-28A Draco and Beechcraft King Air-based surveillance aircraft is coming under increasing scrutiny. SOCOM and U.S. Air Force officials have repeatedly stressed that while ditching the U-28As and King Airs will free up resources to help field its new OA-1K Sky Warden light attack aircraft, the latter is not a replacement for the former. The Government Accountability Office (GAO), a Congressional watchdog, confirmed to The War Zone earlier this week that it is currently conducting a classified review of SOCOM's decision to divest the U-28As and King Air-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft, the latter of which are often referred to collectively as MC-12s. This is separate from GAO's already extensive and still ongoing assessments of the Armed Overwatch program that led to the OA-1K, a single turboprop-engined light attack aircraft based on the Air Tractor AT-802 crop duster. The OA-1K Sky Warden. L3Harris 'SOCOM told us that their decisions about Armed Overwatch occurred separate from their decisions to divest of existing aircraft,' a GAO spokesperson told The War Zone. 'We are separately conducting a classified assessment of SOCOM’s process for how it decided to divest of ISR aircraft.' 'SOCOM plans to divest two ISR platforms. Subsequently, some personnel and resources from the platforms will be used to support Armed Overwatch,' GAO said in an unclassified summary of its assessments to date of the Armed Overwatch program that was released earlier this month. 'However, GAO found that SOCOM has not taken steps to plan for, or add, critical ISR capabilities provided by soon-to-be divested aircraft. Also, SOCOM has not addressed risks associated with the loss of these capabilities if the new aircraft does not provide them.' A U-28A Draco. USAF MC-12W Liberty aircraft like the one seen here are among the ISR-configured Beechcraft King Air variants currently in service across the U.S. special operations community. USAF The exact sizes of the current U-28A and King Air ISR fleets are not entirely clear. In a report published in December 2023, GAO said that close to 40 U-28As and around 15 ISR-configured King Airs remained in service. The Draco is a militarized version of the Pilatus PC-12M single-engine turboprop, while the members of the Beechcraft King Air family are twin-engine turboprop types. U-28As and MC-12s carry different, but similar mixes of sensors, including electro-optical and infrared video cameras and signals intelligence (SIGINT) suites. A graph showing the OA-1K (Armed Overwatch), MC-12, and U-28 fleet sizes as of Fiscal Year 2023 and how they are expected to change by the end of the decade. GAO There is also uncertainty now around the expected size of the OA-1K fleet. In its Fiscal Year 2025 budget proposal released earlier this year, SOCOM revealed plans to shrink the total Sky Warden purchases down to 62 from 75. 'Our requirement still remains 75 [OA-1Ks] based on what we've determined,' Air Force Lt. Gen. Michael Conley, head of Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), told The War Zone and others at a media roundtable on the sidelines of the Air & Space Forces Association's main annual conference last week. 'I think it still provides a cost-effective close air support platform, which is one of the missions that it was designed for. It's still going to provide an ISR capability.' The OA-1K can carry camera turrets and other sensors in pods under its wings, but these will only provide limited capabilities compared to the integrated ISR suites found on the U-28A and King Air variants. As already noted, SOCOM and the Air Force have now made clear that they do not see the Sky Warden as a replacement capability-wise for any existing crewed fixed-wing surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft. At the annual SOF Week conference in May, SOCOM officials said that they working on new aerial ISR requirements that could lead to more direct successor to the U-28A and King Airs. A graphic showing a ‘maximum strike load’ configuration for the Sky Warden that includes a sensor pod with a pair of camera turrets. Air Tractor Inc. A core underlying issue in all of this is the broader shift in focus across the U.S. military to preparing for future high-end fights, especially a potential one against China in the Pacific, after decades of counter-terrorism and other lower-intensity missions. The U.S. special operations community, which had been at the forefront of operations during the Global War on Terror era, is at a particular watershed moment now. This has had a direct impact on planning around the OA-1K and SOCOM's crewed fixed-wing ISR fleets, as well as other special operations unique aircraft like the AC-130J Ghostrider gunship. 'From when OA-1K was conceptualized and decided on until now, the world’s changed a little bit,' Lt. Gen. Conley said last week. 'But as we move forward, I think there’s opportunity to look at, again, some novel mission sets. …how quick can we get the wings on and off it so we could use it in some sort of crisis response, if we needed to? Where does the role of SIGINT [signals intelligence], or ELINT [electronic intelligence] or… some sort of ISR collect [factor in] there. I think there’s opportunity for that. Again, not anything we’ve committed to yet.' When it comes to discussions about crewed fixed-wing ISR capabilities, especially in a world full of ever-more capable and steadily proliferating air defense threats, this broader debate extends beyond just the U.S. special operations community. The U.S. Army has also been divesting significant numbers of turboprop surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft, fleets that had ballooned in size in the past 15 years to support operations in places like Iraq and Afghanistan. That service is now looking at a new mix of aerial ISR capabilities that includes modified business jets and high-altitude balloons. King Air-based types like the MC-12S Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (EMARSS) seen here are among the turboprop ISR aircraft the US Army has also been divesting in recent years. US Army AFSOC's Conley also stressed at the AFA conference this year that while the primary focus of America's armed forces now is being ready to execute major combat operations against a near-peer opponent, this doesn't mean that lower-end missions will evaporate. A central argument behind the Armed Overwatch program has always been the value of having cheaper alternatives to tactical combat jets, bombers, and other aircraft for conducting light attack and ISR missions in permissive environments. A concept of operations like this also frees up other aircraft for higher-priority missions, or just allows them to not have to fly as much, helping to reduce maintenance and logistics costs. Aircraft like the Sky Warden have the additional benefit of being able to operate with minimal footprints at far-flung locations closer to their mission areas without the need for already heavily in-demand tanker support. That proximity also helps when it comes to time on station, which has its own cost implications. The price to operate fast jets and other aircraft for bases further afield to conduct short-endurance sorties can quickly add up. 'I tell my team every day [that] the Pacific is incredibly important to us for all the reasons – you know, Secretary [of the Air Force Frank Kendall has put emphasis on] China, China, China – we get it,' the head of AFSOC explained. 'But we've also got a rest of world mission that I'm responsible for, as well.' 'We still have a global mission. &#8230; I don't think we're done in CENTCOM,' he continued, referring to U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. military operations across the Middle East, which is currently in the throes of a number of major crises in which the U.S. military is embroiled to differing degrees. 'And I think there's probably some disconnects in how we analyze what the future fight will look like.' Lt. Gen. Conley also noted that his command is 'still digesting' the latest of GAO's assessments on OA-1K and that there is 'some reconciliation we still need to do' with regard to the Congressional watchdog's work to date. AFSOC, as well as SOCOM, will now also have to do the same with regard to whatever comes out of GAO's separate review of the plans to shed the U-28As and King Airs, which may have new impacts on U.S. special operations aviation plans going forward.

Israel Executes Massive Bunker Buster Strike On Hezbollah Command...	Beirut has been rocked by huge explosions, with Israel confirming that it carried out airstrikes against Hezbollah’s main military headquarters in the Lebanese capital. Information is still emerging, but Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah is said to have been the target, while this afternoon’s raids were the biggest to hit Beirut since the start of the current conflict in the Middle East, almost a year ago. In Beirut this afternoon, a series of explosions were heard across the city, leaving multiple huge plumes of dark smoke. Smoke was even visible from the city of Batroun, roughly an hour’s drive north of the Lebanese capital.

The Last Viper Commander: Dutch Squadron Boss On Today’s Retireme...	After 45 years of service, including multiple combat deployments, the F-16 was formally retired today by the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF). Ahead of today’s flight and retirement ceremony, TWZ spoke to Lt. Col. Patrick 'Naish' Vreeburg, the commander of 302 Squadron, the final RNLAF F-16 operator, who reflected on the type’s service — and what comes next. As for the Dutch F-16s, these will almost certainly see more combat again before too long, with two dozen refurbished jets to be transferred to Ukraine. Lt. Col.

From here, seven of the last Dutch F-16s (and one Belgian) took off for a farewell flight, taking them over key locations associated with the Viper’s long career in the country. Among the places flown over were the Netherlands Ministry of Defense in the Hague and the Air Force Headquarters in Breda, as well as other bases where the F-16 was previously based. Brig. Gen.

RNLAF/YouTube screencap First off, it’s worth recalling the key facts and milestones associated with the F-16 in Dutch service. The Netherlands was one of the first four European Participating Air Forces (EPAF) to sign up for the F-16 as part of the so-called ‘Sale of the Century,’ primarily to replace its aging F-104 Starfighter fleet.

The first order was for 102 F-16s, comprising 80 single-seat F-16As and 22 two-seat F-16Bs. The first Dutch-built F-16 took to the air on May 3, 1979, and an initial delivery to the RNLAF followed in June of the same year. An F-16AM operated by the U.S.-based RNLAF training unit, from Luke Air Force Base, Arizona. Frank Crébas In December 1983, the Dutch government approved plans to buy another 111 F-16s (97 F-16As and 14 F-16Bs), the last of which was rolled out of the Fokker production facility in February 1992. By then, however, the Cold War was over and the security landscape in Europe looked very different. In 1993 it was decided that only 138 of the jets would pass through the Mid-Life Update (MLU) program, rather than the 170 originally planned. The MLU was completed in 2003, the same year in which it was announced that the fleet would be reduced again, by 25 percent. The steady downsizing of the Dutch Viper fleet provided opportunities for other operators. Beginning in 2005, Jordan acquired six F-16BMs, while Chile acquired a first batch of 18 jets (11 F-16AMs and seven F-16BMs) in the same year, followed by another batch of 18 single-seaters in 2008. An F-16AM from 312 Squadron over the North Sea. Frank Crébas The Dutch first took the F-16 to war over the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s, under Operations Joint Falcon and Allied Force. During the latter campaign, on April 4, 1999, a Dutch F-16 shot down a Serbian MiG-29 Fulcrum fighter with an AIM-120 AMRAAM missile, for the first RNLAF aerial kill since World War II. Dutch F-16s also struck Serbian ground targets in the same operation, including using AGM-65G Maverick air-to-ground missiles. Subsequently, RNLAF F-16s flew missions over Afghanistan under Operation Enduring Freedom, with the jets initially based in Kyrgyzstan. Dutch F-16s also took part in the NATO air campaign over Libya, followed by counter-IS missions in the Middle East. Regular deployments were also made to the Baltics as part of NATO’s Baltic Air Policing rotational mission, to defend the airspace of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. While the F-16 was originally acquired by the RNLAF with the expectation that it would fly short-range air defense and battlefield interdiction with ‘dumb’ munitions during a war with the Warsaw Pact, the post-Cold War world put very different demands on the jet and its operators. An RNLAF F-16 driver prepares for a night mission. Frank Crébas Nevertheless, the F-16 excelled at out-of-area operations and extended deployments far from the Netherlands. On more than one occasion, for example during the operations in Afghanistan and Iraq/Syria, a political decision was made and, only a couple of days later, Dutch F-16s would be flying in theater. With such an illustrious career behind it, it’s no surprise that Lt. Col. Vreeburg has some mixed feelings about the F-16’s retirement. 'Of course, it’s a big moment,' he told TWZ. 'After 45 years of operating the F-16 in the Royal Netherlands Air Force and a lot of deployments over the last 20-plus years, and very important tasks before that during the Cold War. But we need now to focus on our people and our assets, to transition to the F-35 to provide a credible deterrence.' Vreeburg admitted that his job as commander of 312 Squadron has meant that he’s been almost too busy to reflect on the retirement of the F-16, a jet that has played a huge part in his service career, its cockpit providing his ‘office’ for the last 23 years. An RNLAF F-16AM configured for air defense ejects an infrared flare. Frank Crébas 'I’ve been on 10 deployments with the F-16,' Vreeburg explained. 'We had a lot of adventures together, and it flies… like heaven. It really flies like a razor blade. Almost as soon as you even think about turning, it already goes. I don’t know how it’s going to be on the F-35. I’m lucky that I’m transitioning to the F-35 so I will keep flying.' The first F-35s arrived at Leeuwarden on October 31, 2019, and the RNLAF now has 40 of the 52 units already ordered, with more planned. That changeover is something that Vreeburg likened to trading in your first car for a new model. 'You had a lot of adventures with it, and now it’s served its purpose… it cannot bring you any more to where you need to go, and so you need something else, but you keep fond memories of it.' Of those 10 combat deployments, Vreeburg recalled them as being 'all memorable in their own way. The first one, and then the first one as a flight lead. And then the first deployment that flew out of Afghanistan instead of from Kyrgyzstan into Afghanistan. Then you had Libya. Then you had Iraq. I think one of the most memorable of my deployments to Kandahar was when we had the Battle of Chora, when we, together with the Netherlands Army, went onto the offensive to take that valley back. At one point we had the whole battle group from the Netherlands Army, with all six aircraft, even including the spares, all above that valley at the same time, combating the Taliban. So that was one of the most memorable deployments I had.' With Smokewinders on the wingtips, an F-16AM flies over some typical Dutch countryside. Frank Crébas While combat deployments finished with the end of the Operation Inherent Resolve rotations, until the beginning of this year, RNLAF F-16s were still undertaking some quick reaction alert (QRA) air defense duties, of Benelux (Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg) airspace, Vreeburg explained. 'We still did one month of standby duty, 24/7, with a small group of pilots and maintainers. We had a small group of aircraft to perform that mission. We also still had the DCA [dual-capable aircraft], our nuclear mission. At the end of February, we transitioned the QRA task to the F-35 and at the end of May we transitioned the DCA task also to the F-35.' An RNLAF F-16AM flies alongside the first Dutch F-35A. Frank Crébas Vreeburg continued: 'After that, we focused still on investing in our people. We still had some flight lead upgrades going on and we did some mission commander upgrades. We also did a deployment just before the summer break to Norway, where we flew support for the weapon instructor course, as ‘red air.’ We used that deployment to train our people in deploying and operating from an unfamiliar airfield. We finished up the last flight lead upgrade a couple of weeks ago, and meanwhile, besides that, we were mainly, especially since the summer break, flying support for the F-35 as red air, but also as blue air, because they also need entities to protect in their training. We could also use that in our flight lead upgrades or for our own training because all of our guys are transitioning to the F-35, so we have to keep them smart — or make them even smarter. Although it’s another aircraft, 90 percent of the skills you learn are also usable.' An RNLAF F-16AM accompanies an RNLAF F-35A. Frank Crébas A contractor-operated A-4K from Draken International, an RNLAF F-16AM, and an RNLAF F-35A. Frank Crébas So far, Vreeburg hasn’t flown an F-35, but he already knows what he thinks he might miss once he transitions to the fifth-generation fighter. 'In the F-16, under the canopy, you sit almost on top of the aircraft, you have almost restricted vision all around you. And it also flies a bit smoother, although that depends, right? If you have tanks, jamming pods, and weapons on your wings, then it flies totally differently than only with a centerline tank and a couple of missiles. In the F-35, almost everything is internal, most of the time, so it’s almost apples and oranges. But I’m hearing it’s not such smooth flying. The aerodynamics are different; the F-35 has a different wing shape, and you have the boundary layer that rumbles through the aircraft, which you don’t have on the F-16.' An F-16BM assigned to the U.S.-based RNLAF training unit rips through a valley at low level. Frank Crébas Frank Crébas Despite these differences, the basics of flying the jet will remain broadly similar, but the big change will come with mission employment, Vreeburg said. 'The tactics are different because the capabilities of the F-35 are different. With the F-16, you cannot employ the tactics that the F-35 can. We cannot fly as close to a ground-based threat as the F-35 can. Of course, we have to turn around when confronted by certain aircraft, because they will certainly see us and shoot at us. We might have to outmaneuver their missiles.' While evading modern air defense systems was becoming an increasing challenge for Dutch F-16 pilots, keeping the dwindling number of jets mission-ready proved to be less of a problem. 'There were enough spare parts,' Vreeburg said. 'But I think the biggest contributing factor was that a couple of years ago, we unified our separate maintenance squadrons. So that whole process from a broken jet or a jet needing maintenance to put it back on the flight line was now just one process, instead of broken up into separate ones. And of course, we also have a ton of experience in this squadron. We hand out a gold medal for 36 years of service as a non-commissioned officer. I think have handed out 50 or 60 in the last couple of years. There are lot of people with 30-plus years of F-16 experience.'

This jet was among those later transferred to Jordan. Frank Crébas Consistent upgrades, starting with the MLU program, have ensured that the F-16 remains relevant and able to meet the changing demands of air warfare and take on new missions as required. When Vreeburg started flying the Viper in the RNLAF’s U.S.-based training program, he was using the older Block 15OCU version, but by the time he was back in the Netherlands, he was getting acquainted with the MLU jet, in its initial M1 tape software iteration, followed soon after by the M2 tape. The RNLAF F-16s were successively upgraded to M6.5 tape, adding new capabilities all the time. 'I think one of the biggest changes was the incorporation of Link 16,' Vreeburg explained. 'It’s made it possible to fly other tactics. After that, each successive generation of targeting pod, which, of course, for our mainly close airport missions in Afghanistan, and later on in Iraq and Syria, was essential to provide support for troops on the ground. Later on, the incorporation of GPS-aided monitions like the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) and Small Diameter Bomb (SDB), then combined laser- and GPS-guided weapons, and the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS), of course.' Yesterday the Dutch JTAC community said their goodbyes to the RNLAF F-16 with one last CAS training mission. The oldest and youngest JTAC controlled 2 312 Vipers over Volkel. Targets destroyed.

Frank Crébas Three Dutch F-16s perform a break for the camera. Frank Crébas Right now, Vreeburg’s 312 Squadron has already converted its first pilots onto the F-35, and they are now flying with 313 Squadron, which has already converted to the F-35 at Volkel. 'The next pilots transitioning will also fly with 313 Squadron because if you look out of our window, they just started building our Special Access Program Facility [SAPF, used for classified intelligence and secure communications operations related to the F-35]. This whole building needs to be redone. The contractors will come in, strip everything down, redo it, finish it, and then we expect to be able to move back in here in 2027. By that time there should be enough trained pilots and maintainers to start operating with the first one or two flights.' Meanwhile, the first F-35s for 312 Squadron are very nearly ready. Vreeburg confirmed that there are 'a couple of F-35s' for the unit now being completed by Lockheed Martin. 'There were supposed to be done, but they are still waiting to be finished, and that will probably take a little while, but they are already 90 percent done.' Progressive modernization of the Dutch F-16 fleet means that the surviving aircraft are still more than capable in many combat scenarios, and they have been snapped up by Ukraine, which long sought to acquire jets of this type. RNLAF F-16AMs — carrying live AIM-120 AMRAAM and AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles — escort a U.S. Air Force B-52H over Europe. Frank Crébas 'The Netherlands government has promised 24 F-16s to the Ukrainian government,' Vreeburg explained. 'Our role in this is that we are the last squadron flying the F-16, so the F-16 expertise is in this squadron. We have a separate entity in our squadron, which is going to take care of the required maintenance and the handover to Ukraine. Although 312 Squadron is focused on the transition to the F-35, not everybody can start training at the same time. Maintainers also need to do training for the F-35 and as long as they are waiting to start that, they can help prepare the aircraft for Ukraine. And most of our aircraft are going to industry to get an overhaul, before being transferred to Ukraine. We still need to do some maintenance over here, before flying them to the industry. The only F-16 pilots that we still have are in this squadron or attached to it, so we have a small group of people who will keep flying the F-16 just to get them from Volkel to somewhere else.' Lt. Col. 'Naish' Vreeburg in the cockpit of an F-16AM. Frank Crébas Just 1 more week of RNLAF F-16 operations. Last week another week of fini flights and goodbyes. Even said goodbye to a couple of jets. Preparations for the final goodbye next week Friday are in full swing. Have a nice weekend.

Col. 'Naish' Vreeburg is still convinced that the F-16 has a lot more to offer once it arrives with the Ukrainian Air Force. 'The time has come to let the F-16 go, but I am convinced it can still be very valuable,' Vreeburg concluded. 'Let it go to new owners and a new purpose. Today will be a goodbye, but not the end. We need to clean up and finish up to make sure that the next user has good jets and effective jets to work with. We wish them a whole lot of luck doing that — to give them hell!'

Was A Mini 'Sword Bomb' Just Used To Strike A Car In Lebanon?	Imagery said to show the aftermath of a highly targeted air strike on a car in Lebanon has prompted questions about whether a previously unknown miniature munition designed to produce extremely little collateral damage may have been employed. Damage to the vehicle's windshield, in particular, has drawn broad comparisons to the telltale impact marks of the AGM-114R9X variant of the Hellfire missile, which has an array of pop-out blades rather than an explosive warhead. A video and several still pictures from the strike, which is said to have occurred in the Lebanese capital Beirut, began circulation on social media earlier today. The driver was wounded, but it is unclear what their condition might be now. Whether this individual, who does appear to have been identified as of yet, was the intended target of the strike and whether anyone else was in the car at the time is unknown. This all comes amid a major Israeli campaign targeting the terrorist group Hezbollah characterized so far by unprecedented attacks involving pagers and other electronics rigged to detonate on command, as well as days now of traditional airstrikes. There are now signs Israel may be preparing to invade southern Lebanon. Warning: some of the images below are very graphic.

The damage also looks to be consistent with a non-explosive kinetic munition designed to destroy its target through force of impact. A close-up look at the impact mark on the car's windshield. via X A deeper look at the interior of the car, including the sheered-off steering wheel. via X The cross-shaped impact mark left in the car's windshield is a primary factor that has prompted comparisons to the AGM-114R9X, a weapon The War Zone was first to report on the emergence of back in 2017. Also known by the nicknames 'ninja bomb' and 'the flying Ginsu,' the R9X version of the Hellfire has an array of sword-like blades (likely six) that are designed to pop out right before impact. You can read more about what is known about that missile, which was specifically designed to produce extremely little collateral damage during targeted strikes, here. What's claimed to be the remains of an R9X missile from a recent strike in Syria. This is by far the most complete examples I've seen.cc @FranticGoat Nick Waters (@N_Waters89) June 17, 2020 It is possible that Israel has developed a miniature aerial munition with four pop-out blades in the same general vein as the AGM-114R9X. At the same time, the potential 'blades' are arrayed around a well-defined circular center point. This is very different from what is typically seen after the employment of R9X Hellfires with their long blades explicitly designed to tear through whatever they hit. As such, there is also the possibility the 'blade' marks seen on the windshield of the car in Beirut could also be where the fins of a small munition passed through the windshield. Pictures of a car in Syria believed to have been struck by an AGM-114R9X in 2019 showing the kinds of impact marks associated with that weapon. via X Miniature air-launched munitions of various types, especially to arm equally small drones, are of growing interest globally. There are a number of known designs that feature arrays of stabilizing fins at the tail end or along the body, or both, which could conceivably leave similar impact marks on a car if employed in a non-explosive configuration. Northrop Grumman's Hatchet, the Shyrke from Corvid Technologies and L3Harris, Raytheon's Pyros Small Tactical Munition, and Textron's Fury are examples of such munitions that have been developed just in the United States in recent years. Foreign companies, like Roketsan in Turkey with its MAM family of munitions, are also in this growing market space. Another possibility might be that the munition that hit the car had an explosive warhead, but it did not detonate for some reason. At the same time, Israel does have an established history of employing aerial munitions with reduced explosive payloads or none at all. The U.S. military and others also employ similar kinds of low-collateral damage munitions, including inert bombs with warhead sections filled with concrete. The apparent precision of the strike on the car in Beirut also raises the question of how the munition might have been guided. The War Zone has pointed out in the past that the AGM-114R9X could require an operator-in-the-loop guidance system to be able to hit targets, such as a specific individual inside a moving vehicle, very precisely and to do so reliably. Israeli firms have been and continue to be pioneers in the development of operator-in-the-loop guidance capabilities. Advances in artificial intelligence-driven targeting capabilities could drastically help with this, as well. There is even the possibility that the R9X may have some degree of autonomous guidance that can recognize the selected aim point by itself. Much about the strike on the car in Beirut does remain unknown, but there are certainly signs that point to the employment of a new small and very low collateral damage munition. It would also make great sense to develop and deploy a smaller 'Ginsu-like' munition, especially for use with smaller drones, and for carrying out even more exacting strikes. While what we know about the strike in Beirut does not conclusively prove that such a munition now exists, it may just be a matter of time.
