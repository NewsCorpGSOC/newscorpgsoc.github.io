Bunker Talk: Let’s Talk About All The Things We Did And Didn’t Co...	Welcome to Bunker Talk. This is a weekend open discussion post for the best commenting crew on the net, in which we can chat about all the stuff that went on this week that we didn’t cover. We can also talk about the stuff we did or whatever else grabs your interest. In other words, it’s an off-topic thread. The caption to this week’s top shot reads: COLORADO SPRINGS, CO - MAY 10: A group of media were allowed inside Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station as NORAD celebrates its 60th Anniversary on May 10, 2018 in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

If you want to talk politics, do so respectfully and know that there’s always somebody that isn’t going to agree with you. If you have political differences, hash it out respectfully, stick to the facts, and no childish name-calling or personal attacks of any kind. If you can’t handle yourself in that manner, then please, discuss virtually anything else. No drive-by garbage political memes. No conspiracy theory rants. Links to crackpot sites will be axed, too. Trolling and shitposting will not be tolerated. No obsessive behavior about other users. Just don’t interact with folks you don’t like. Do not be a sucker and feed trolls! That’s as much on you as on them. Use the mute button if you don’t like what you see. So unless you have something of quality to say, know how to treat people with respect, understand that everyone isn’t going to subscribe to your exact same worldview, and have come to terms with the reality that there is no perfect solution when it comes to moderation of a community like this, it’s probably best to just move on. Finally, as always, report offenders, please. This doesn’t mean reporting people who don’t share your political views, but we really need your help in this regard. The Bunker is open!

Land Rover Replacement Program Kickstarted By U.K. Military After...	The end is in sight for one of the British Army’s most iconic vehicles, the Land Rover, with the U.K. Ministry of Defense having put out an industry request for a successor. While the British Army’s Land Rover fleet is now far smaller than in its Cold War heyday, it remains one of the best-known military vehicles anywhere in the world, and its design — inspired by the World War II-era Willys Jeep — is a pioneer of the 4&#215;4, off-road-capable segment. A Weapons Mounted Installation Kit (WMIK) Land Rover of the Queen’s Royal Lancers (QRL) on a desert patrol, toward the Iranian border, during the war in Iraq. Crown Copyright A Request for Information (RFI) for the British Army’s Light Mobility Vehicle (LMV) was issued today by the U.K. Ministry of Defense, starting the procurement process for a fleet of vehicles that will replace the last Land Rovers — as well as the Pinzgauer, an Austrian-designed high-mobility all-terrain utility vehicle. Both of these vehicles are intended to be withdrawn by 2030. Issued in the early stage of the program, an RFI essentially serves to gauge industry interest. It’s unclear how many LMVs the Ministry of Defense is looking to buy, but in 2022 the ministry said that the British Armed Forces had a combined total of 7,837 Land Rovers and Pinzgauers, giving some idea of the scale of the requirement. A 6&#215;6 Pinzgauer is used to tow one of the British Army’s Watchkeeper unmanned aerial systems prior to launch from RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus. Crown Copyright Cpl 'Matty' Matthews Based on the RFI, the Ministry of Defense is looking for details of production, supply, in-service support, and training for a future LMV, a wheeled utility platform that is one part of the broader Land Mobility Program (LMP). A potential for an off-the-shelf (OTS) solution is favored, to ensure that a proven design can be fielded rapidly and without significant investment in its development. Meanwhile, the broader LMP effort seeks to radically rationalize the British Army’s fighting vehicle fleet, reducing the number of types of protected patrol and light utility vehicles in service from more than a dozen types now in use, to just three. These three new vehicle types will be procured under separate strands of LMP: a Medium Protected Mobility Vehicle weighing less than 20 tonnes, a Light Protected Mobility (LPM) weighing less than 10 tonnes, and the aforementioned Light Mobility Vehicle at less than three-and-a-half tonnes. A soldier from 3 Para, cleans a 50-cal machine gun mounted on a WIMIK Land Rover, in the Taliban stronghold town of Nowzad, Helmand Province, Afghanistan. Crown Copyright In each case, the Ministry of Defense wants to select designs that conform to Generic Vehicle Architecture (GVA) standards — a baseline that will allow continued spiral development across the service life of the vehicles. Other requirements include compliance with the Land Industrial Strategy, which calls for at least 60 percent of the workshare to be handled by U.K. industry. In the fall of last year, the Ministry of Defense said that it wanted to start the tendering process for the Land Mobility Program by November 2025 and then select the chosen platforms by October 2026. A so-called 'Minimum Deployable Capability' is envisaged for before 2029. A Royal Marine WMIK Land Rover moves forward up a convoy as it provides escort protection between Camp Bastion and Kandahar Airport, during operations in Afghanistan. Crown Copyright It’s already been decided that the Light Mobility Vehicle will lead the requirement process, although it’s expected to be followed soon after by the Light Protected Mobility Vehicle program. The LMV has been described in the past as an unprotected or lightly protected tactical vehicle. Aside from this, few specific requirements have been publicly discussed, although there will likely be a wide range of platforms to choose from, with the 4&#215;4 light military vehicle marketplace being a very crowded one. In the past, designs that have been suggested as suitable for the British Army’s LMP have included the Hawkei and Bushmaster from Thales, Babcock’s General Logistics Vehicle, and the GM Defense Infantry Squad Vehicle. A Thales promotional video showing the 1,000th Hawkei — a vehicle that could be a possible British Army Land Rover replacement: Overall, there is a lot at stake in the Land Mobility Program, and the Light Mobility Vehicle especially, with various previous efforts at procuring new vehicles in this class having ended in failure. There is also the fact that the Light Mobility Vehicle in particular seeks to replace a vehicle that has been essentially irreplaceable for the British Army for more than 75 years. The British Army received its first Series 1 Land Rovers in 1949, only a year after the design was first unveiled, and the vehicle was successively improved over the years, reflecting the service’s experience, including in multiple overseas conflicts.

The first of these entered service with the British Army in 1985. A British Army Land Rover Defender patrol during Operation Palliser, the British military intervention in Sierra Leone in 2000. Crown Copyright Next came the Defender Wolf, which entered service in 1997 and was actually an entirely new design, also known by the formal designation Truck Utility Light High Specification/Truck Utility Medium High Specification. Close to 8,000 Defender Wolf vehicles were acquired, in short- and long-wheelbase versions.

Crown Copyright These became signature vehicles of post-Cold War conflicts in which the British Army was involved, spawning at least 65 different variants, including some adapted for special forces use. In the process, the vehicle was further modified, adding beefed-up suspension, more powerful brakes, and weapon mounts that could accommodate machine guns and even an automatic grenade launcher. Other important variants of the British Army Land Rover include battlefield ambulances, with a capacity for a combination of up to four stretchers or six seated casualties. This, like other Land Rovers, is also air-portable and has a limited amphibious capability, being able to wade through water. British Army Land Rover battlefield ambulances. Crown Copyright However, experience in the counterinsurgency warfare that dominated British Army operations in the first decade of the 21st century demonstrated that the Land Rover, even when provided with additional armor, was too poorly protected to withstand threats such as improvised explosive devices (IEDs), typically placed as roadside bombs. Land Rovers were steadily withdrawn in favor of better-protected vehicles, like the Force Protection Ocelot, known in British Army service as the Foxhound, a wheeled infantry mobility vehicle featuring the V-shaped hull typical of mine-resistant vehicles. British Army Foxhounds on the Drawsko Pomorskie Training Area (DPTA) in Poland for Exercise Steadfast Defender 2024. Crown Copyright However, the United Kingdom continues to invest in the Land Rover to keep the vehicles viable until their final withdrawal in 2030. In September last year, a contract worth £71 million (around $86 million) was signed, to provide spares and post-design services for the Land Rover and Pinzgauer, as well as their associated trailers. Much of the Land Rover’s longevity with the British Army is due to its simplicity, ruggedness, and the ease with which it can be repaired — especially vital when in the field. However, in recent years, it’s primarily been used in secondary roles, not on the battlefield, but in a support and training capacity. Soldiers from the Royal Yeomanry exercising in a RWMIK-configured Land Rover on the Bramley Training Area in Hampshire, England. Crown Copyright 'They are used in liaison roles as communications vehicles, transport vehicles,' Maj. Donald Urquhart from 154 (Scottish) Regiment Royal Logistic Corps, told Forces News in 2023. 'Currently they are used very much in a training role for deploying and operations. On operations, we generally try and go for an armored vehicle, so these are training platforms normally carrying radios and command posts.' Maj. Urquhart added that the antiquated nature of the design also provides one of its biggest advantages. 'These vehicles are still very successful because they don’t have any electronics on them. There’s no electronic control unit so a very straightforward to fix and that’s probably the biggest single strength.' The British Army’s Land Rover successor will be more complex but will almost certainly also offer a better level of protection, meaning it can return to working in more hazardous environments. Whatever vehicle is chosen, it seems impossible that it will match the longevity of the Land Rover, which will have been in British Army service for an astonishing 81 years, provided it sees out its service, as currently planned, in 2030.

Two More CL-415 Super Scoopers On The Way To Fight Palisades Fire...	Cal Fire will receive two more CL-415 Super Scoopers from a Canadian non-profit to replace the one damaged Thursday by a drone strike as it was fighting the Palisades Fire, The War Zone has learned. This will take the total force of Super Scoopers currently available to Cal Fire from one to three. In addition, it is hoped that the aircraft, which has a hole in its left wing, will be back on line by early next week. The appearance of the drone in the firefighting area despite restrictions temporarily grounded all firefighting aircraft working that fire, as The War Zone was the first to report. 'The new planes will be sent in the middle of next week if the weather is good for flying,' Stiphane Caron, spokesman for the Quebec-based SOPFEU non-profit told us on Friday. At issue, he said, are the winds and snow often present in Canada during this time of year that can often keep aircraft grounded. The organization has eight CL-415s and six older CL-215s, Caron explained. As for the damaged Super Scooper, LA County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone told reporters on Friday that the hopes the aircraft will be flying again on Monday. 'That Super Scooper will be prioritized for repair. 24/7,' he said. Maintenance personnel from SOPFREU and from De Havilland Aircraft, which built the plane, are on scene evaluating the damage and how it can be repaired, Caron said. 'The goal is to get the plane back [to California] by next week,' Caron posited. 'That is what we hope for. It is what they told us they are able to do. But there are no guarantees. It is an airplane and needs to be fixed.' 'Specific questions about the incident and aircraft condition should be directed to the operator, however, De Havilland Canada is providing support as needed and has prioritized requests to the highest level to provide assistance and or parts to enable the operator to get the aircraft back in operation as soon as possible,' the company told us in a statement. As The War Zone was the first to report, the damaged Super Scooper was one of two that Cal Fire currently leases. They are unique and highly valued assets with the ability to drop up to 1,600 gallons of water at a time and do so repeatedly on a single flight by scooping up more water from the ocean and lakes. Other fixed-wing firefighting aircraft of similar size and larger must land at an airport and be refilled, which takes a lot of time. The fact that SOPFUE is providing two more Super Scoopers and hopes to have the damaged one back on line next week gives firefighters greater options, Chris Thomas, a spokesman assigned to the Palisades Fire, told us. 'We have six other fires and they could use them' elsewhere, Thomas said, adding that the two Super Scoopers currently under lease are assigned specifically to fighting the Palisades Fire. Despite the plane being out of service, Cal Fire has 17 additional fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft that are working to fill the gap, Thomas pointged out. However, the fire grew by more than 10 percent overnight, to nearly 20,000 acres, and is only 8% contained. 'We fear that the death toll might rise,' Thomas cautioned.

(Photo by Apu Gomes/Getty Images) Apu Gomes To help prevent a future drone strike, the FBI is bringing in anti-drone equipment, Thomas told us. He was not informed what kind. We reached out to the FBI for additional information. Thomas added that while the LA County Fire Department has its own anti-drone equipment that it deploys for events and other situations, it will not be used for this fire because of the FBI equipment. Thomas could not say if the county's anti-drone equipment had previously been deployed for this fire or, if it wasn't, why not. Usually this type of equipment provides awareness of drones in the sky, but has no means to take them down. You can read all about the issues with doing the latter in domestic airspace here. The drone incident has sparked 'a huge investigation' being led by the FBI, Thomas explained. 'They are taking this extremely seriously.' 'Our federal partners behind the scenes are going to be implementing procedures to be able to follow drones in our two large fire areas,' LA County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone told reporters on Friday. 'And they will be able to identify who the operator of that drone is. The most important thing to know is that if you fly a drone at one of these brush fires all aerial operations will be shut down. And we certainly don't want to have that happen.' The drone into the firefighting area despite an FAA-ordered Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR) that runs through Jan. 24. FAA 'It’s a federal crime, punishable by up to 12 months in prison, to interfere with firefighting efforts on public lands,' the FAA said in a statement. 'Additionally, the FAA can impose a civil penalty of up to $75,000 against any drone pilot who interferes with wildfire suppression, law enforcement or emergency response operations when temporary flight restrictions (TFRs) are in place. The FAA treats these violations seriously and immediately considers swift enforcement action for these offenses. The FAA has not authorized anyone unaffiliated with the Los Angeles firefighting operations to fly drones in the TFRs.' The pilots of the Super Scooper did not know they had been hit by a drone until landing at Van Nuys Airport, Marrone noted. 'It is unknown exactly what time this small drone hit the wing of our CL 415 Super Scooper aircraft that we currently have on contract from the Province of Quebec,' Marrone told reporters on Friday. After they landed, 'the maintenance staff noticed that there was a fist-sized hole in the leading edge of the wing inboard of the landing light.' While the temporary loss of the Super Scooper has placed an extra burden on firefighters, the fact that the fleet will now double is at least one silver lining in a horrific situation. Please, whatever you do, please keep your drones far away from active firefighting operations.

Second Batch Of Air Force CCA Drones Could Be 20 To 30 Percent Pr...	The second tranche of U.S. Air Force Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones could be between 20 to 30 percent more expensive per airframe than those in the first batch. At the same time, Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall has said he does not believe the so-called Increment 2 CCAs should evolve into high-end exquisite platforms. This comes amid serious questions about the Air Force's ability to afford its next round of CCAs, as well as other future advanced aircraft, including new sixth-generation crewed combat jets and stealthy tankers. Secretary Kendall talked about plans for CCA's Increment 2, the core requirements for which are still being solidified, in a recent interview with Air & Space Forces Magazine. The Air Force is working to acquire what could ultimately be a fleet of multiple different types of CCA drones through iterative development cycles. Anduril and General Atomics are currently developing designs as part of Increment 1. Dozens of contractors are also working on other aspects of the program, including advanced autonomous technologies. Models of the Increment 1 CCA designs from General Atomics (top) and Anduril (bottom). General Atomics/Jamie Hunter 'I think, personally, something that has some increase in cost over Increment 1 would not be outrageous,' Kendall told Air & Space Forces Magazine. '20 or 30 percent, something like that.' Kendall has said in the past that the goal is for the price point for Increment 1 CCas to be between one-quarter and one-third of that of an F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. This would put the price tag of a single one of those drones at between around $20.5 and $27.5 million based on publicly available Joint Strike Fighter cost data. A 20/30 percent increase in those figures would put the price range for Increment 2 CCAs at between approximately $24.6/$26.65 and $33/35.75 million. 'But, again, it depends upon the mix, right? What capabilities do you put on every aircraft, every CCA? What do you distribute?' Kendall added. The Air Force's top civilian has noted on multiple occasions in the past how CCAs designed to operate in networked groups closely together with crewed aircraft will not each have to feature the same broad mix of capabilities found on traditional combat jets. This, in turn, opens up the possibility for new design opportunities that can have beneficial downstream impacts, including when it comes to keeping costs low, across development, production, and sustainment cycles. This is something TWZ has also been highlighting for years now, well before the current CCA program emerged, especially when it comes to work on fully networked drone swarm capabilities. The video below from Collins Aerospace presents one notional vision for how CCAs might operate together with crewed aircraft, at least initially. 'A fighter is designed to do a lot of things – a crewed fighter – have a lot of subsystems on it, sensing electronic warfare, command and control to some degree, the communications, as well as carry a variety of weapons,' Kendall said back in December during an online chat hosted by the Air & Space Forces Associations' Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies. 'Every CCA doesn't have to have all those things, but you have to have a mix that, working together again with a crewed aircraft, gives you the set of capabilities that's most cost effective.' 'I don't regard CCAs as expendable. They're not munitions. &#8230; we don't send them all to die,' the Air Force's top civilian had also said at that time. 'So there needs to be enough survivability in them – the combination of how you equip them, design them, plus tactics so that you can have reasonable attrition in most areas – but they are things that you are willing to let a few of die in order to gain an advantage.' Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall. USAF 'The good news with CCA is we started at day one with this [iterative] approach, and so a number of trades have been made, and we have the capacity to make more, right?' Andrew Hunter, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology & Logistics, said during a separate talk that the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS) think tank hosted in December. 'And because of the way that we've approached the CCA program with more than one increment, we can make different trade-offs in future increments.' 'Is it more capable? Is it more affordable? Where on the &#8230; the spectrum will Increment 2 land? Those are questions to be explored,' Hunter added. 'Is it more exquisite and where does it fall on the spectrum? &#8230; [there is] still a lot to be determined in that process.' As noted, in his more recent interview with Air & Space Forces Magazine, Secretary Kendall said the Increment 2 CCA should 'definitely' not be 'exquisite' platforms. In this context, exquisite would refer to much higher-end (and expensive) drone designs, such as stealthy, highly advanced, heavier payload, flying wing uncrewed combat air vehicles (UCAV). Air Force officials have more broadly pushed back on the idea of pursuing a stealthy UCAV in favor of lower-tier and cheaper CCA concepts that could be acquired more affordably in greater numbers. This was underscored last year by Lockheed Martin's disclosure that its losing pitch for CCA's Increment 1 was a higher-end 'gold-plated' design. As TWZ has pointed out previously, this is all in spite of the potential value that UCAVs could provide as part of a larger mix of crewed and uncrewed aircraft and despite significant prior investments the U.S. military has made on that front. In addition, multiple countries around the world, especially China, but also including Russia, France, Turkey, and India, are actively working on flying wing-type UCAVs. A model of a Chinese GJ-11 Sharp Sword, one of a number of flying wing UCAV designs in active development in that country. Yang Suping/VCG via Getty Images For the Air Force, discussions about what the service might want out of Increment 2 CCAs are intertwined with increasingly worrisome discussions about the affordability of a number of major modernization efforts. This includes work on a new sixth-generation stealthy crewed combat jet and advanced stealth tankers. The sixth-generation combat jet and CCA programs are both part of the Air Force's larger Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative. Other budget pressures, especially due to the Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile program's ballooning cost growth, as well as deliberations about the expected size of the future B-21 Raider stealth bomber fleet, are also factors. A deep review of the sixth-generation combat jet plans is set to wrap up under the incoming Trump administration, which will also be in a position to make new decisions about the CCA, next-generation aerial refueling aircraft, and other efforts. President-elect Donald Trump has not yet named a nominee for Secretary of the Air Force. A rendering of a notional sixth-generation stealth crewed combat jet flying together with a trio of drones. Collins Aerospace A rendering of a notional sixth-generation crewed combat jet flying together with a trio of drones. Collins Aerospace 'These three potential new designs and platforms [the NGAD combat jet, CCAs, and stealthy tankers] are all tied together, both operationally and from an affordability perspective. We are working through a sprint of about four months of effort to determine the best combination of capabilities to pursue at various investment levels,' Secretary Kendall said during a speech last November. 'The variable that concerns me most as we go through this analysis and produce a range of alternatives is going to be [the availability of adequate resources.] … to pursue any combination of those new designs.' 'Right now, given our commitments, our resources, and strategic priorities, it’s hard for me to see how we can afford any combination of those new designs,' Kendall bluntly added. A rendering of a notional stealthy tanker refueling a pair of F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. Lockheed Martin Skunk Works There is 'a consensus that there are a number of other things that we need to fund,' but that it 'would still be beneficial to have an NGAD-like aircraft' if sufficient funding is made available, the Air Force Secretary more recently told Air & Space Forces Magazine. When it comes to CCAs, the Air Force also expects them, in general, to have a transformative impact on how it fights, as well as its day-to-day activities, including training and maintenance cycles. Last year, the service announced it had ordered more Increment 1 types to help in the development of new concepts of operations and tactics, techniques, and procedures around the new drones. Service officials have said they could ultimately buy between 100 and 150 Increment 1 CCAs, and multiple thousands of drones across all of the program's eventual increments. Crewed surrogates, including specially modified F-16 Vipers, are supporting those efforts, as well. What the Air Force learns from that experimentation could well feed into the still-ongoing refinement of the Increment 2 requirements. As it stands right now, the Air Force does increasingly look to be leaning toward greater capability, and cost, for its second batch of CCAs.

One Of Just Two CL-415 Super Scooper Planes Taken Out Of Palisade...	A drone's collision with a water-dropping aircraft fighting the Palisades fire in Los Angeles caused the temporary grounding of all aircraft working that fire and took out one of just the two amphibous planes capable of repeatedly scooping 1,600 gallons of water from the ocean and delivering it onto nearby flames, Cal Fire told The War Zone. A Canadair CL-415 Super Scooper turboprop plane smashed into a drone around 10 a.m. local time, Cal Fire spokesman Chris Thomas told The War Zone.

Thousands of homes have been destroyed in the neighborhood located between Malibu and Santa Monica. 'This is creating a huge danger,' said Thomas. 'This is an unprecedented fire. When we ground all aircraft, it could be anywhere from 15 minutes to half an hour. You know how far a fire can spread in half an hour.' The Super Scoopers have been making dozens of flights a day, with multiple drops on each flight, meaning Cal Fire loses the ability to drop tens of thousands of gallons of badly needed water until the damaged aircraft is repaired. The Super Scoopers fly over the fire, release their water, and then head over to the ocean to refill, a process that takes about five minutes. This is a unique capability, at least for Cal Fire, as fixed-wing firefighting aircraft of similar size or larger need to land at an airport to refill and can't execute continuous drops on a single sortie to beat back a raging fire line.

The drone was being flown by a photographer taking video of the flames, the LA Times reported. FAA 'It’s a federal crime, punishable by up to 12 months in prison, to interfere with firefighting efforts on public lands,' the FAA said in a statement. 'Additionally, the FAA can impose a civil penalty of up to $75,000 against any drone pilot who interferes with wildfire suppression, law enforcement or emergency response operations when temporary flight restrictions (TFRs) are in place. The FAA treats these violations seriously and immediately considers swift enforcement action for these offenses. The FAA has not authorized anyone unaffiliated with the Los Angeles firefighting operations to fly drones in the TFRs.' With winds calming down a bit, air attack is well underway, day and night. More fires have popped up in recent hours that threaten suburban areas. So having every possible asset working to the maximum of its ability is critical. Sadly, that won't be the case for one of the Super Scoopers. So, please people leave your drones at home during the massive, catastrophic fire that thousands are putting their lives on the line trying to contain.

Biden Puts Forward Final Ukraine Military Aid Package Of His Admi...	The Biden administration today announced its last Presidential Drawdown Authority aid to Ukraine before Donald Trump becomes president. It is a $500 million package that includes AIM-7 Sparrows and RIM-7 Sea Sparrows, missiles for so-called FrankenSam air defense systems, and AIM-9M Sidewinders, as well as air-to-ground munitions, support equipment for the dozens of donated F-16s, the vast majority of which have still not arrived, and armored bridging systems among other items. The Pentagon declined to provide us with details about what variant of air-to-ground munitions or what kind of support equipment for F-16s, which the U.S. has not supplied but allowed several nations to provide their own Vipers to Ukraine. One of the first official images of an F-16 in Ukraine, configured for an air defense mission. (Ukrainian MoD screencap) This PDA, which provides Ukraine with equipment from U.S. stocks, also included armored bridging systems, secure communications equipment, small arms and ammunition, spare parts, ancillary equipment, services, training, and transportation. It leaves a little more than $4 billion in PDA authorizations for the incoming Trump administration to decide what to do with, Pentagon Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters, including from The War Zone, on Wednesday. She blamed the 2023 budget impasse for the Biden administration’s inability to provide the full mandate of PDA donations to Ukraine. Asked about whether the Pentagon is concerned that funding for Ukraine could dry up under the Trump administration, Singh noted 'bipartisan' Congressional support for Kyiv. Since taking office, the Biden administration has committed more than $66.5 billion in security assistance to Ukraine, according to the latest Pentagon statistics. In addition to the aforementioned air defense capabilities, that funding has provided Ukraine with a wide array of arms including shoulder-launched Javelin anti-tank weapons, Abrams tanks, drones like the Phoenix Ghost family of loitering munitions and Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) now being used against targets in Russia.

It was held in Ramstein, Germany, against the backdrop of a looming change in the White House, something top of mind among many of the roughly 50 UDCG member nations. While it is the last one for the Biden administration, Zelensky suggested a new meeting could take place in February. Zelensky: Ukraine will have additional air defense systems.

Over the course of its existence, the UDGC organized separate teams to support each of those functions.

Today, during a press briefing, he noted that Russia has seen a tremendous number of its troops killed and wounded fighting Ukraine in no small measure due to allied support. 'Russia has suffered more than 700,000 casualties in Ukraine. Now that's more than Moscow has endured in all of its conflicts since World War Two,' he said. In what is likely one of his last press conferences, Austin also called for continuing support for Ukraine with a veiled nod to Trump. Russian President Vladimir 'Putin wants a world where empire tramples sovereignty, a world where conquest trumps human rights, a world where tyranny bulldozes democracy,' he told reporters. 'Every autocrat on Earth is watching to see whether Putin gets away with it, and so this coalition must continue to stand four-square with Ukraine and to strengthen Ukraine's hand for the negotiations that will someday bring Putin's monstrous war to a close. Now that road is challenging, but all the alternatives are far worse. No responsible leader would let Putin have his way.' LIVE: @SecDef Lloyd J. Austin III Holds Briefing on UDCG Department of Defense (@DeptofDefense) January 9, 2025 Even before taking office, Trump has cast his shadow over future U.S. relations with Ukraine. While it is still unknown what his approach will be, his choice as peace envoy to Kyiv offered yet another hint about what that could look like. Trump wants to broker a peace deal within 100 days of being inaugurated, retired Army Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg told Fox News on Wednesday. 'People need to understand, he's not trying to give something to Putin or to the Russians,' Kellogg posited. 'He's actually trying to save Ukraine and save their sovereignty.' Trump is 'not trying to give anything to Putin or the Russians' but is 'trying to save Ukraine and preserve its sovereignty,' the president-elect's special envoy Keith Kellogg said on Fox News.'And he's going to make sure that it's fair and that it's honest.

The Latest Before the UDGC meeting, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told reporters he is working to end the war on acceptable terms, but did not say what those were. He has previously floated a 10-point plan that includes, among other things, the withdrawal of all Russian troops from Ukrainian territory and cessation of hostilities, restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, punishing Russia for war crimes, and release of all prisoners and deportees. 'I do everything I can to end this war with dignity for Ukraine and all of Europe this year, and I know I can count on your support,' he said. Putin, on the other hand, does not want peace, Zelensky argued, pointing to the introduction of some 12,000 North Korean troops to the battlefield as a prime example. 'Putin is not just holding on to his investments in aggression. He is doubling down. He's even started basically hiring soldiers from North Korea to keep this war going,' Zelensky argued. 'North Korea studies modern warfare. They do not value their people, and we know it. They lose them - 4,000 as [of] today, but Pyongyang gets experience, cheap, to re-export the war, maybe there in the Pacific. At the same time, this collusion with North Korea shows Putin's weakness, because no ruler in Moscow would ever allow themselves to beg in Pyongyang unless facing critical problems.' 1/4,000 North Korean troops killed or wounded fighting against Ukraine, Zelensky claims.North Korean troops fighting alongside Russian forces against Ukraine have suffered 4,000 casualties, including both wounded and killed, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed on…&mdash; Lew Anno Suport#Israel #Ukraine 24/2-22 (@anno1540) January 9, 2025 Defeating Putin is not just in the interest of Ukraine, Zelensky avowed, hinting without proof that last fall’s drone incursions over U.S. bases in Europe might have a Russian connection. 'Now we see all the reports with [suspected Russian severing of] underwater cables in the Baltic Sea, and we all see drone incidents in some countries that are raising serious concerns. We see debilitation in Africa, which threatens Europe with new migration waves, and we are also learning more about how Russian intelligence paid militants in Afghanistan to target coalition soldiers…Moscow cashed in to kill your soldiers, American soldiers, NATO country soldiers. How can this be forgiven or forgotten? Russia's hybrid aggression and sabotage in the entire Western world is ongoing, and only by keeping and strengthening our cooperation, by boosting our agreements and coalitions, can truly protect the normal lives of people in all our countries.' It will strengthen security programs. We see reports about underwater cables in the Baltic Sea, drone incidents in some countries raising serious concerns, and destabilization in Africa threatening Europe with new migration waves.&mdash; Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa) January 9, 2025 Earlier on Thursday, the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) issued a report suggesting that failure to support Ukraine in the future would cost the U.S. nearly a trillion dollars over the next five years. 'We conclude that maintaining security in a strategic environment in which Russia is victorious over Ukraine could cost the United States an additional $808 billion in defense spending over five years,' AEI suggested. 'These resources would be required on top of the currently planned defense budget over that same period and would be used to build the defense capacity, capability, and posture to provide for American security and meet current commitments to NATO in the new, more dangerous strategic environment.' The assessment, however, is based on the assumption that the U.S. ends support for Ukraine and NATO allies fail to close the gap. It is questionable at this point whether either of those developments come to pass, especially given the joint statement of support issued today.

'It's one of our wins, I think, one of the biggest wins, not just last year, but throughout the war,' he told reporters ahead of Thursday's UDCG meeting. 'Russia had to pull almost 60,000 troops of the Ukrainian Front to deal with it. And as of this Monday, it's been five months since our troops have maintained a buffer zone on Russian territory.' A recently launched new Ukrainian offensive there has so far achieved little. 'Russian forces recently advanced in the Ukrainian salient in Kursk Oblast amid continued offensive operations in the area on January 8,' the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) wrote in its latest assessment. 'Geolocated footage published on January 8 indicates that Russian forces advanced into western Nikolaevka (northwest of Sudzha) and marginally advanced in Makhnovka (southeast of Sudzha). Ukraine's Special Operations Forces (SSO) reported on January 8 that Ukrainian forces repelled a Russian roughly reinforced platoon-sized mechanized assault in an unspecified area in Kursk Oblast.'

U.S. Navy Still Wants To Operate Out Of This Norwegian Submarine ...	The U.S. Navy has long eyed a return to a cavernous former Royal Norwegian Navy base that could serve as a convenient support point for submarine operations in the Arctic. But if and when American boats will ever be able to return to the Cold War-era Olavsvern complex remains to be seen. Olavsvern appeared poised to return to operations in late 2020, when Norway’s state broadcaster NRK first reported that the complex could again be used by American submarines, and that U.S. military officials had made multiple visits to the site in anticipation of a new lease deal. But U.S. and Norwegian officials told TWZ this week that, to date, such plans have not materialized. While officials have not provided the precise reasons for the stall, it’s been years since an American submarine has used the facility, with U.S. 6th Fleet telling TWZ that a sub last visited the installation in 2009. The Olavsvern complex is nestled in a Norwegian fjord. (WilNor Governmental Services) The complex would appear to offer several advantages for U.S. forces headed into the Arctic. Nestled in the nation’s fjords near the Norwegian Sea, and built under a mountain, the once-secretive Olavsvern base would provide America’s silent service with a prime port location for facilitating patrols in the nearby Barents Sea and Arctic region, waters heavily trafficked by the Russian fleet. Such hardened facilities are complicated and very expensive to build, and portions of the complex sit beneath nearly 900 feet of rock. Norway's Olavsvern military complex. (Google Maps) 'We’d like to go back there,' a U.S. defense official told TWZ on condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations. 'The location speaks for itself.' Submarine caves are rarer than they once were during the Cold War, but some are still in use around the globe today, including much more modern and elaborate facilities. China has a massive submarine cave that is capable of housing nuclear submarines at the Yulin Naval Base on the South China Sea's Hainan Island, for instance. Go here to read more about what we know of the complex. How long it might actually take for the U.S. Navy to restart operations there, and what alterations would be required to support nuclear submarines, remains unclear. Images suggest that America's submarines could not fit into the complex's submarine tunnels, but deep-sea quays for larger vessels, including nuclear subs, sit on the outside of Olavsvern, according to the Arctic Institute, a nonprofit American think tank. Questions also remain about what kind of servicing would be offered to American boats there. Beyond a quick resupply port call or relatively minor fixes, nuclear submarines require extensive support infrastructure. One of the waterways inside Norway's Olavsvern complex. (WilNor Governmental Services) Geography aside, past TWZ reporting from when a new deal appeared close to completion showcased other aspects of Olavsvern that could make it an ideal U.S. submarine hub in the region. It features 32,000 square feet of deep-water docking space, including a dock for maintenance, and the subterranean areas are accessed via a large blast door and 3,000-foot-long entrance tunnel. The entire base covers 270,000 square feet. Olavsvern also has barracks, hardened storage areas, and other maintenance facilities above and below the surface.

(WilNor Governmental Services) Olavsvern began as a military fuel depot in the early 1950s and cost $450 million to build over four decades, mostly financed by NATO, according to the think tank, with a massive, hydraulic steel gate installed at the mountain basin’s entrance in the late 1960s, as well as fresh water supplies, a power plant, and ventilation. Submarines and fast patrol boats were brought into the mountain basin for maintenance and repair during the Cold War, according to the Arctic Institute. An ammunition storage area the Olavsvern complex in Norway. (WilNor Governmental Services) 'The base complex soon became an important center for national and Allied exercises and winter training,' the institute says in a history of the complex. 'Olavsvern was also utilized for a significant number of port calls by Allied submarines enroute to and from the High North,' the history continues. 'A Norwegian submarine was always kept on 24 hour readiness in the mountain basin, with one submarine always at sea.' The French Aquitaine class frigate Normandie (D-651) during a port call at the Olavsvern complex. (WilNor Government Services) Continued U.S. Navy interest in the facility comes as Russia has expanded its regional operations in recent years. Across Russia's Arctic territory, this has included an increase in submarine activity and the expansion of its northernmost Arctic base, along with notable physical expansion of a constellation of air and other bases across Russia’s territory in the far north. The Barents Sea is a critical transit point for Russian submarines and other warships heading from their bases in the northwestern part of the country toward the Atlantic via the so-called Greenland, Iceland, United Kingdom (GIUK) gap. While 6th Fleet officials said the command continues to work with Oslo to explore using Olavsvern 'in ways that would benefit both our shared security and the local community,' NRK has in the past reported on local concerns about safety risks from having nuclear-powered subs in the area. A tunnel in the Olavsvern complex, Norway. (WilNor Governmental Services) The Norwegian Ministry of Defense sold the base to a private group in 2013, and ministry officials told TWZ that, 'as of today, there are no concrete plans to expand the military use of facilities at Olavsvern.' Olavsvern is currently held by military logistics services provider WilNor Governmental Services, and the base is primarily used for annual winter training by the Dutch Marine Corps, the firm’s CEO, Vidar Hole, told TWZ Thursday. But Hole said WilNor wants to once again make Olavsvern a logistics hub and High North forward operating base, as it was during the Cold War. Dutch Marines used the Olavsvern complex in Norway for annual winter training. (WilNor Governmental Services) The last military commanding officer of the base before it was sold relayed that nuclear-powered subs made more than 150 port calls there over the years, according to Hole. 'The infrastructure for receiving SSNs and their crews is intact and in good working condition,' he said. 'The technical status of the base, including submarine compliant port infrastructure, has been documented thoroughly by various allied site surveys as well as by a commercial surveying company.' But before Olavsvern could ever once again accommodate nuclear subs, the firm requires approval from Norwegian radiation authorities, Hole said. 'We have earlier requested the MoDo assistance to initiate this process,' he said. 'Regrettably, we do not have clarity on if and when they will accommodate our request.' Norwegian MOD officials did not answer a TWZ query regarding that request by deadline. Hole said the base has hosted several U.S. senators and U.S. embassy staff, with a bipartisan group of senators visiting the nearby city of Tromsø in 2023. Outside Olavsvern, the U.S. submarine force has in recent years conducted several port visits in nearby Grøtsund harbor, north of the nearby city of Tromsø, which 'accommodates U.S. submarines very well,' 6th Fleet officials said. The Virginia class attack submarine USS New Mexico (SSN-779) visited in May 2021. The Virginia class attack submarine USS New Mexico (SSN-779) visited Norway in 2021. (U.S. Navy) The Ohio class guided-missile submarine USS Florida (SSGN-728) made its own visit there in September 2023, and the secretive attack submarine USS Seawolf (SSN-575) also made a high-profile visit to the area in 2020. The attack submarine USS Seawolf (SSN-21). (U.S. Navy) While Olavsvern was sold as part of the post-Cold War drawdown undertaken by Western militaries after the fall of the Soviet Union, Norway has seen 'a significant increase' in the number of visits by American, British and French submarines since Russia annexed the Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014, according to the Arctic Institute. 'According to the Norwegian Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority (DSA), the number of visits has increased from 10-15 to 30-40 visits per year (except for 2020, when the number of port calls was fewer),' the institute states in its history of Olavsvern. As NATO members in Europe surge defense spending and capabilities in the face of Russia’s war in Ukraine and continued saber-rattling against the West, it remains unclear if or when Olavsvern will ever be dragooned into the effort, and whether its expansive and fortified capabilities will ever once again be utilized to counter Moscow in the Arctic. Either way, American and NATO submarines will undoubtedly continue to work to expand their operations and influence in the increasingly critical region.

Sweden Buys More Leopard 2 Tanks As Part Of Major Defense Build-u...	Sweden is buying 44 German-made Leopard 2A8 tanks, in addition to upgrading 66 of its older models to the same standard, continuing a period of military investment for the Scandinavian country, which joined NATO last year. The decision adds another customer to a growing list of Leopard 2A8 operators, which also notably includes fellow NATO members Lithuania and Norway, also in the strategically critical Baltic region. The plans were announced today by the Swedish Defense Materiel Administration (FMV), responsible for procuring weapons for the country’s armed forces. The 44 Leopard 2A8s being purchased as new will receive the Swedish designation Stridsvagn 123B. Sweden’s 66 existing Stridsvagn 122 tanks (equivalent to the Leopard 2A5) will emerge as Stridsvagn 123A vehicles once modernized. A Leopard 2A8 tank. KNDS Deutschland Together, the two contracts are worth almost 20 billion Swedish Krona — around $1.8 billion. Built by KNDS Deutschland (formerly Krauss-Maffei Wegmann), the modernized tanks are scheduled for delivery between 2027 and 2030, while the 44 newly manufactured tanks will be delivered from 2028 to 2031. When plans to modernize the Stridsvagn 122 were first announced, it was said that the upgraded vehicles would serve 'at least into the 2030s.' 'The Stridsvagn 123A and 123B will be among the absolute most modern tanks in the world,' Göran Mårtensson, the director of the FMV, said in a statement. 'Compared to Stridsvagn 122, it is basically a completely new tank, although they may look similar on the outside.' The Leopard 2A5, which was introduced in the mid-1990s, is armed with a 120mm/L44 smoothbore main gun, which was superseded in later versions, including the Leopard 2A8, with a longer-barrel 120mm/L55 gun. The Leopard 2A5 primarily differed from earlier models in having additional armor protection on the turret and the hull. Swedish Stridsvagn 122 tanks during the Strong Europe Tank Challenge at the Grafenwoehr Training Area, Germany, in 2018. U.S. Army photo by Christoph Koppers Christoph Koppers Overall, the Leopard 2A8 is broadly similar in many respects to the Leopard 2A7V, in use since 2014, which features an air-conditioning system, advanced optronics, and programmable ammunition. While the Leopard 2A8 retains the same engine, transmission, and main gun as the Leopard 2A7V, it features additional defensive measures, including the latest version of the Israeli-made Rafael Trophy active standoff protection system, which you can read more about here. The promotional video below from Trophy’s manufacturer Rafael offers a good general overview of how the system functions: You can read more about the differences between Leopard 2 variants here. Sweden originally acquired 120 Stridsvagn 122 tanks in the mid-1990s. These have since received modest upgrades and 10 of them have been provided to Ukraine. The new Swedish tank orders are, in part, intended to compensate for the transfers to Ukraine. A similar program of backfilling is also replacing artillery pieces, combat vehicles, naval craft, ammunition, and anti-tank weapons that Sweden has also donated to Ukraine. However, building up the Swedish Armed Forces’ tank branch is a lot more than that, with an increase in overall numbers as well as capabilities, part of a new posture that has been developed in line with NATO membership and the resurgent military threat from Russia. In 2013, for example, before Russia’s annexation of Crimea, Sweden’s active tank fleet had been reduced to just 42 Stridsvagn 122s, with tanks being rotated in and out of storage to reduce wear and tear. By 2015, Sweden had decided to field an additional tank company on the island of Gotland, which occupies a strategic position in the Baltic, and which had been highly militarized during the Cold War. An armored training exercise on Gotland in 2021 marked the first time that tanks had been on the island for 20 years. Meanwhile, tank numbers overall have been increased, with previously stored Stridsvagn 122s returned to service.

Swedish Ministry of Defense Once the new and upgraded tanks are in service, Sweden will have 154 tanks, compared with the 110 that are available today, according to the Swedish Armed Forces. At the same time, the choice of the Leopard 2A8 provides commonality not only with Lithuania and Norway, but also with Germany and the Netherlands, who have also ordered it, and which are also increasingly focused on land warfare operations in the Baltic region. Driven by new NATO memberships for Finland and Sweden, the value of commonality across weapons systems, for the Nordic countries in particular, is something that we have discussed in the past. As well as new and upgraded tanks, Sweden has also decided to modernize its fleet of Combat Vehicle 90 (CV90) tracked armored fighting vehicles. This work is valued at a little over 5 billion Swedish Krona (around $450 million) and is scheduled to be completed by 2030. Around 500 vehicles in the CV90 family are currently in Swedish service.

Anthony Housey Overall, the investments in new and improved armor are part of Sweden’s plan to increase the size of its army, including adding another four Army brigades by 2030. 'This is crucial for us to be able to reach the high goals that politics has set for the Armed Forces and FMV,' Swedish Minister of Defense Pål Jonson said during a visit to the Gotland Regiment earlier this week. 'These are lofty goals, but they must be lofty goals in the serious global situation we have right now,' he added. When Sweden joined NATO, it was 'a direct result of Russia’s illegal, unprovoked, and indefensible war of aggression' in Ukraine, according to Sweden’s Minister for Foreign Affairs Tobias Billström, speaking last year. 'We must plan and prepare for a prolonged confrontation with Russia. We must counter Russia’s expansion of power by constraining its influence, its freedom of action, and — ultimately — its ability to do harm,' Billström added. In October last year, the Swedish government confirmed plans to increase the size of its armed forces, adding around 27,000 soldiers by 2030 to provide a total of around 115,000 personnel, both professional soldiers and conscripts.

Photo by Johan Nilsson/TT / TT News Agency / AFP JOHAN NILSSON/TT This expansion is being enabled by an increase in defense spending, including an additional 170 billion Swedish Krona ($16.41 billion) announced last year, on top of the normal annual budget over the coming five years. By 2028, defense spending will amount to 2.6 percent of GDP in 2028, compared to 2.2 percent in 2024. As well as new and upgraded armor, key Swedish defense procurement programs include modernization of the Swedish Navy’s five Visby class corvettes, including providing them with new air defense systems and buying three larger Luleå class corvettes. Meanwhile, the Swedish Air Force is to receive a third GlobalEye surveillance aircraft, as well as 12 UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters to add to the 15 already operated. An artist’s impression of the future Luleå class corvette. Saab As well as the Kremlin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sweden has had other causes for concern as a result of Russian military activities closer to its borders. In a notorious incident in 2013, Russian bombers simulated a nuclear attack on the capital, Stockholm, with the Swedish Air Force unable to respond. Flying across the Gulf of Finland, the Tu-22M3 Backfire bombers came within 18 to 24 miles of Swedish territory near Gotland Island, around 100 miles from Stockholm. The lack of Swedish fighters on quick reaction alert at the time became a matter of controversy and a stark reminder of a lack of preparedness for war. Instead, two Danish F-16 fighters shadowed the Russian aircraft. In 2014, there were reports of a Russian submarine operating in the shallow waters of the Stockholm archipelago, supported by five credible public sightings. The Swedish Navy abandoned efforts to find the submarine after a week, in another embarrassing incident for the armed forces. Since then, preparations for a potential war with Russia have included issuing every household, in 2018, with pamphlets titled 'If crisis or war comes,' in a throwback to the days of the Cold War. A man holds the new version of the preparedness booklet 'If crisis or war comes,' that was distributed to all Swedish households, in November 2024 in Stockholm, Sweden. Photo by Claudio BRESCIANI / TT News Agency / AFP CLAUDIO BRESCIANI There have also been growing concerns more widely within NATO about Russian ‘hybrid warfare,’ especially in the Baltic region. Here, there has been a spate of apparent sabotage against undersea infrastructure, specifically undersea cables, with suspicions that this may have been inspired by, if not carried out by the Kremlin. In Sweden itself, unidentified drones have been seen in the airspace over multiple nuclear power facilities, as well as in restricted airspace over Sweden’s Royal Palace. Against this backdrop, the procurement of new tanks for the Swedish Armed Forces, and the modernization of existing armor, was to be expected. In addition to providing a boost in capabilities and numbers to Sweden’s tank forces, it’s a move that further underscores the resurgence of the main battle tank after many years of force reductions within Europe.

Army Wants To Test Air-Launched Drones From A Global Express Busi...	The U.S. Army is looking at testing launched effects from a special missions version of the Bombardier Global 6500 bizjet. The announcement further underscores the fact that the service is looking to expand the capabilities of its High Accuracy Detection and Exploitation System (HADES) aircraft, based on the Global 6500, the first of which was delivered last November. There have long been quesations about the survivability of the HADES in more contested airspace, and adding launched effects is one way that could potentially help mitigate that. HADES is set to give the Army a new crewed fixed-wing aerial intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities. It’s expected to provide a radical overhaul compared with the Army’s existing aerial ISR platforms, flying higher, faster, and farther, and for longer periods, while carrying a bigger sensor payload. Yesterday, the Army released a Request for Information (RFI) outlining its plans for the demonstration, which it wants to take place in the Fiscal Year 26 timeframe. Launched effects, previously referred to as air-launched effects (ALEs), describes a category of various uncrewed systems that you can read more about here. The new launched effects terminology reflects the fact they might be launched from land or maritime platforms, as well as crewed and uncrewed aircraft. A Bombardier Global 6500 in the process of being converted into an Army Theater Level High-Altitude Expeditionary Next-Generation Airborne ISR-Radar (ATHENA-R) aircraft. L3Harris Since it’s an experimental effort, we don’t know for sure if the launched effects that will be tested will end up on HADES, on another Global 6500-based platform, or even on a different aircraft altogether. However, the Army says it’s looking at launched effects capabilities that will 'potentially be integrated on medium/high-altitude aerial platforms that function as Aerial Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (A-ISR) aircraft.' Aside from HADES, the Army is already operating other Global 6500-based ISR assets, which could also be used in the launched effects demonstration. These include two Global 6500s converted under the Army Theater Level High-Altitude Expeditionary Next-Generation Airborne ISR-Sensor (Athena-S) effort, and another pair of Global 6500s converted under the Athena-Radar effort. There have been at least two prior indications that the Army has plans to integrate launched effects on its HADES aircraft, at least. Speaking at the handover of the first HADES aircraft at the Bombardier Defense facility in Wichita, Kansas, in a ceremony last November 26, Andrew Evans, Headquarters, Department of the Army’s (HQDA) G-2’s ISR Task Force Director confirmed that launched effects were part of the thinking for the aircraft’s development path. A group shot in front of the first HADES prototype aircraft at the Bombardier Defense facility in Wichita, Kansas, last November 26. Bombardier Asked about the possibility of integrating launched effects on HADES, Evans said: 'I would say that, at the strategic level, we know we need to move in that direction. How we do that is still unknown. When we do that is still unknown, but what we know we need to do is continue to be responsive, also to the adversary’s ability to generate sensing and effects from for more extended ranges.' Evans added that the current HADES configuration 'has some incredible capabilities,' but noted that it 'will be even more powerful if we can extend the effects of that system, by two or three times, by launching sensors off the rail.' 'We are designing the system to be able to do that,' Evans added, although he noted that 'We haven’t yet determined how we will integrate that into the force.' Before this, there had been a strong suggestion that launched effects or some other kinds of potentially disposable stores were being envisaged for HADES. An official concept rendering of the aircraft, released by the Army in early 2024, showed two pylons under each of the wings, although it was not clear what kinds of stores were being carried. A low-quality conceptual image of a HADES jet, showing the underwing pylons with stores being carried. U.S. Army Daniel Baldwin By July of last year, launched effects were being talked about explicitly in relation to HADES. In a discussion with Breaking Defense about the hardpoints under the wing of HADES, Andrew Evans confirmed that these would allow the Army to add new capabilities — potentially also defensive ones — to the aircraft without any major changes to the baseline configuration. 'We’re looking at that with great interest as well, right? Protecting something like this becomes very important,' Evans said at the time, adding that launched effects were one potential payload for the underwing pylons. When asked whether the pylons could also be used for some kind of offensive weapon, Evans said this was unlikely and 'a little bit of a hard line for us.' Returning to the RFI, which covers a requirement specified by the Army’s Special Electronic Mission Aircraft Product Directorate of the Fixed Wing Project Office (FWPO), this calls for the launched effects to be 'integrated onto the hardpoints of an all-weather, pressurized, large-sized-cabin Federal Aviation Administration FAR part 25 certified executive jet-category aircraft,' specifically the aforementioned Global 6500. Another rendering of a HADES aircraft, again with underwing stores. U.S. Army The Army wants the launched effects to be compatible with the host aircraft operating above 41,000 feet and flying faster than 400 knots for a period longer than seven hours. The launched effect systems 'will be carried and deployed from pylons at the inboard or outboard wing hardpoint stations of the host aircraft in a non-pressurized environment at the host aircraft operating conditions,' the RFI states, specifying that the entire launched effect, launcher, and pylon should weigh less than 1,800 pounds for the inboard stations, and less than 600 pounds for the smaller outboard stations. Launched effects cover a wide range of sizes and capabilities and in the past, the Army has discussed a ‘large ALE’ category consisting of drones weighing no more than 225 pounds, and ideally less than 175 pounds. Meanwhile, the ‘small ALE’ category includes drones under 100 pounds, and possibly no more than 50 pounds. It's worth noting that the ALTIUS-600 drone, which the Army has used for various previous launched effects experiments, weighs between 20 and 27 pounds. An ALTIUS-600 is launched from a UH-60 Black Hawk at Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona. Courtesy photo provided by Yuma Proving Ground In the past, the Army has also issued descriptions of the kinds of performance categories that launched effects might be expected to achieve. In the ‘large’ category, the drones are envisaged as having a combat range of up to 350 kilometers (217 miles) and a total flight time of 30 minutes. However, the has also been an aspiration to increase those performance specifications to up to 650 kilometers (404 miles) and an hour of total time in the air. The ‘small’ category specifies a drone that can fly 100 kilometers (161 miles) with a total flying time of at least 30 minutes but with the goal of achieving a range of 150 kilometers (93 miles) and an hour of flight time. When it comes to deploying the launched effects, the host aircraft should not have to perform any specific maneuvers but instead deploy them while in normal cruise configuration. Different launch mechanisms are mentioned in the RFI, comprising gravity or pneumatic separation, rocket/turbojet ignition, and drag chute, with the potential for other options, too. U.S. Army personnel launch an ALTIUS-600 from a DAGOR ultra-light vehicle, using a pneumatic launcher, during an exercise. U.S. Army Few details are provided of what kinds of payloads or functions the launched effects should have, although interested companies are requested to provide information on what intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance integration companies they have worked with. This suggests that an expansion of the host aircraft’s ISR capabilities is the primary interest at this point, although that doesn’t necessarily rule out defensive aids, as Evans previously alluded to. Another important aspect of the RFI seeks for companies to specify the additional equipment required onboard the host aircraft to control and communicate with the launched effect. Among others, the Army anticipates that this could include radio-frequency and/or laser datalinks, data processing equipment, command and control hardware, and antennas. Looking at putting launched effects on HADES is likely driven, at least in part, by concerns about the survivability of the crewed aircraft, especially in the types of high-end conflict that could be fought in the future against a near-peer adversary. While HADES offers a notable performance advantage over the varied fleet of turboprop ISR platforms that it’s set to supersede, it is very far from stealthy. Even with the improved capabilities of its sensors, it may very well have to get within range of longer-range air defense systems to gather intelligence. It’s for this reason that HADES will be integrated within a broader ISR architecture, in the form of a family of systems known as the Multi-Domain Sensing System (MDSS). This is expected to include various uncrewed platforms, including high-altitude glider-like drones and balloons designed to operate in the upper stratosphere. A graphic the Army previously released showing a notional 'operational view' (OV) for how its planned MDSS system of systems, including crewed ISR aircraft, might be employed in conjunction with other assets. U.S. Army Launched effects, delivered off the wing of HADES, could be set to become another part of that ecosystem, or a valuable adjunct to it. As for the Army’s broader launched effects efforts, these are becoming ever more ambitious, with drones launched from crewed and uncrewed aerial platforms as well as from the ground. An older but nonetheless interesting graphic showing how various types of air-launched effects delivered from various platforms could be employed on a future battlefield. U.S. Army In fact, testing launched effects from crewed ISR aircraft is not entirely new for the Army. The ALTIUS-600 drone has been tested from a C-12 aircraft with a launch system installed inside a 'wing locker.' Various companies offer wing lockers as general storage systems that are installed over the wings behind the engine nacelles on these aircraft. An RC-12X Guardrail Common Sensor (GRCS) aircraft. The Army has previously explored delivering launched effects from C-12 series aircraft. U.S. Army Meanwhile, multiple drones have also been flown in networked ‘interactive’ sorties, demonstrating their potential for ‘swarming,’ all while under the control of a single operator, as you can read more about here. In tests like these, launched effects carrying various sensing equipment have been used to gather information about simulated enemy positions. The resulting reconnaissance and targeting data is then fed back to crewed aircraft, ground troops, and to subsequent waves of drones through a mesh tactical network. Even without the possibility of swarming and meshed networks, it’s easy to imagine how launched effects from one or more HADES aircraft could be very valuable. Flying deeper into enemy territory, they could provide operators on the aircraft (and elsewhere) with vital information, including on potential targets for strikes. Used in this way, launched effects could be fitted with nose-mounted cameras, infrared sensors, or electronic surveillance payloads that can detect signals emissions. Launched effects could significantly expand the surveillance size, in terms of the area covered by HADES, while at the same time bringing a wider array of intelligence capabilities, over and above those baseline sensors included in the host airframe. Maybe above all else, they could allow for the HADES aircraft to extend its collection of certain types of intelligence while staying well out of the range of enemy air defenses. An earlier Army video depicts different kinds of mission profiles for launched effects: While the Army seems to have ruled out attack payloads for HADES for now, launched effects configured as electronic attackers, or as decoys could also be part of the equation. Indeed, a major role for the launched effects for other platforms will be stand-in jamming, which could also be beneficial in terms of providing additional measure of survival for HADES in certain scenarios. With a demonstration planned for Fiscal Year 26, we’ll have to wait a while longer to learn more about the kinds of launched effects that the Army wants to test and the broader aspirations of putting these kinds of drones on bizjet-derived crewed ISR platforms. In the meantime, the latest RFI underscores the Army’s ambition to add launched effects to platforms in this category, something that could be fundamental for their survivability in future conflicts.

Ohio Guided Missile Submarine Deployed Underwater Drones On Award...	The U.S. Navy's Ohio class guided missile submarine USS Michigan made notable use of uncrewed underwater vehicles (UUV) in the course of operations between October 2022 and January 2024 it has emerged. During that time, the boat and its crew completed at least three secretive 'national security' missions, as well as ones involving special operations forces, 'in hostile and challenging environments.' As TWZ has explored in detail in the past, the extremely in-demand Ohio class guided missile submarines, or SSGNs, are uniquely capable multi-mission platforms that can perform a wide variety of tasks, including covert and clandestine intelligence gathering and special operations missions, as well as launching throngs of Tomahawk cruise missiles. The Ohio class guided missile submarine USS Michigan seen during a stopover in Okaiwan, Japan in November 2022. USN Details about Michigan's activities between 2022 and 2024 are included in a Navy Unit Commendation (NUC) awarded to the boat in December. The submarine is one of four Ohio SSGNs, which were converted from Ohio class ballistic missile submarines, or SSBNs. Ryan Chan was among the first to notice that the NUC's text was visible in a picture from the award ceremony that the Navy posted online yesterday. The Secretary of the Navy awards NUCs to Navy and Marine Corps units for 'outstanding heroism in action against the enemy' or 'extremely meritorious service, not involving combat, but in support of military operations,' according to an official manual. It is comparable to awarding the unit in question as a whole a Silver Star or Legion of Merit. The full text of the NUC the Navy recently awarded to Michigan is as follows: 'For extremely meritorious service during assigned missions from 9 October 2022 to 16 January 2024. The personnel of Michigan displayed superb operational planning and risk management and precise tactical execution. Operating in hostile and challenging environments, Michigan completed three highly successful missions vital to national security and several special warfare operations. Their achievements contributed to multiple high priority national and theater objectives and significantly enhanced warfighting readiness in the Western Pacific. Michigan's performance advanced multiple naval special warfare and undersea warfare emerging capabilities as well as concepts of operations, tactics, techniques, and procedures, particularly involving the employment of unmanned undersea vehicles. By their truly distinctive achievements, demonstrated skill, and unfailing devotion to duty, the officers and enlisted personnel of USS Michigan reflected great credit upon themselves and upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.' A close-up look at the text of Michigan's NUC, brightened to make it easier to read. USN Navy Rear Adm. Rick Seif, Commander, Submarine Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet, holds a copy of Michigan's NUC during the award ceremony at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, on Dec. 19, 2024. USN Petty Officer 1st Class Scott Barnes In Navy parlance, naval special warfare refers to special operations forces and missions. The NUC also does not say what types of UUVs Michigan employed or in what capacity. 'Having Michigan in theater adds to our already deep bench of undersea warfare capabilities throughout the region,' Navy Rear Adm. Rick Seif, then head of Submarine Group Seven, part of the U.S. 7th Fleet headquartered in Japan, had said in a very generic statement about the boat's deployment back in 2022. 'Their presence demonstrates our continued commitment to providing maritime security and deterrence in the Indo-Pacific.' U.S. 7th Fleet's area of responsibility extends from the Western Pacific to the Indian Ocean. Seif has since risen to the role of Commander, Submarine Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet. The exact array of UUVs currently available for use by Ohio SSGNs is murky, but the submarines do have the ability to deploy (and in some cases recover) various types from their torpedo tubes, as well as any of their 22 large vertical launch tubes and up to two Dry Deck Shelters (DDS) on top of the hull. The DDSs, in particular, offer the potential to employ much larger and more advanced UUVs. The boats also have the ability to launch aerial drones.

In addition, these submarines have impressive intelligence fusion and command and control capabilities to support uncrewed operations, as well as other missions. You can read more about what is known about the Ohio SSGNs in detail in this past TWZ feature. A slide from a past General Dynamics Electric Boat briefing showing how UUVs (here referred to as autonomous underwater vehicles, or AUVs) might be launched and recovered from the launch vertical launch tubes on the Ohio SSGNs. General Dynamics Electric Boat A slide from a past General Dynamics Electric Boat briefing showing how UUVs (here referred to as autonomous underwater vehicles, or AUVs) might be launched and recovered from the launch vertical launch tubes on the Ohio SSGNs. General Dynamics Electric Boat Without more details or context, we really don't know exactly what missions Michigan performed between October 2022 and January 2024 or where they occurred, but here are some example possibilities. UUVs from Michigan could well have been sent discreetly into denied or otherwise sensitive areas to gather intelligence about the disposition and capabilities of the forces of potential adversaries that would be valuable in the event an actual hot conflict breaks out. When it comes to the Pacific region, Chinese and North Korean authorities have already claimed to have seized American underwater spy drones on multiple occasions in the past 20 years or so. UUVs could be configured to investigate and potentially even recover certain objects of interest on the seabed, as well. The U.S. military and the U.S. Intelligence Community have long histories of using specialized submarines and other capabilities to retrieve materiel from below the waves, both to glean new insights into foreign capabilities and to prevent American systems from falling into hostile hands, as you can read more about here. Michigan could have also launched UUVs to help with more general intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) tasks, including just mapping areas of the seafloor in key areas to help develop highly accurate charts to support future operations. The Navy has made clear in the past that so-called Intelligence Preparation of the Operating Environment (IPOE) is a key mission set for various tiers of underwater drones. In broad terms, IPOE involves the collection of a variety of information about specific locale to help with operational planning, including for forthcoming amphibious and special operations missions. Crewed submarines, especially nuclear-powered ones and other types with very quiet advanced conventional propulsion systems, are already inherently ideal ISR platforms. The Navy does also employ UUVs for other missions, including hunting for and neutralizing mines. The service has also been publicly working to acquire larger and otherwise more capable types that could be used for mine laying, kinetic attacks against enemy surface ships and submarines, as well as targets ashore, and as electronic warfare platforms. The Navy has additional uncrewed underwater capabilities in the classified realm. A Navy briefing slide from 2018 highlighting the diversity of mission sets for different tiers of existing and planned future UUVs. USN Michigan's NUC also highlights the Ohio SSGN's significant capabilities to support special operations missions. The boats have dedicated berthing space for special operators – typically a contingent of up to 66 special operations forces personnel, but with a surge capacity of up to 102 operators – as well as the ability to launch and recover swimmer delivery vehicles (SDV). The aforementioned command and control capabilities further allow the boats to function as underwater special operations headquarters nodes. Special operations forces operating from one of these submarines could go ashore to gather additional intelligence, as well as conduct direct action raids. Navy and Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance personnel seen on the deck of the guided missile submarine USS Ohio during training. The large door to the submarine's Dry Deck Shelter is seen open. USN While much about what Michigan did to earn the NUC remains unknown, it does underscore the immense value of the small fleet of Ohio SSGNs offer in peacetime, as well as during actual combat operations. In addition to being some of the most in-demand vessels in the Navy today, they are also among the most coveted assignments by the service's submariners. Just publicly sending one of these boats into a particular region, something the Navy has been more inclined to do in recent years, is enough to send major signals to opponents, as well as to allies and partners, far and wide. A prime example of this was Michigan's arrival in the South Korean port of Busan in 2017 amid heightened geopolitical fiction on the Peninsula. Ohio SSBNs, which typically keep even out of sight during deployments, have also been increasingly making public appearances for the same reasons. The Ohio class guided missile submarine USS Michigan in Busan, South Korea, in 2017. USN www.twz.com The award of the NUC to Michigan also highlights the various missions that Ohio SSGNs would be called upon to perform in a future fight in the Pacific, especially a potential high-end one against China. Subsurface warfare, in general, would be a key aspect of any such conflict, and the U.S. and Chinese armed forces have both been very actively working to expand their abilities to detect and track submarine activity. At the same time, Michigan's new award comes amid uncertainty over the exact future of the Ohio SSGNs. The Navy is working to replace its Ohio SSBNs with new Columbia class boats, but that program has been facing delays and cost growth. There are also plans for a new 'Large Payload Submarine,' possibly based on the Columbia design, to supplant the Ohio SSGNs, but those boats are not expected to arrive until the late 2030s, at the earliest. The Navy has said in the past that the Ohio SSGNs could all be decommissioned by 2028, though it has also been looking at extending their service lives, as well as that of a number of Ohio SSBNs. Enlarged subvariants of the Virginia class attack submarine, as well as existing examples configured to support special operations missions, would help fill the gap. However, they will not provide the same capability, at least in some regards, as found on Michigan and its sister submarines, at least based on what is presently known. US Navy SEALs embarked aboard the Virginia class attack submarine USS New Mexico train in the Mediterranean Sea in 2021. USN In the meantime, the Ohio SSGNs will continue to be heavily utilized, including for the kinds of extremely demanding and secretive operations that earned Michigan the NUC award.

Why Greenland Is Of Growing Strategic Significance	Donald Trump wouldn't catagorically rule out using the U.S. military to take control of Greenland, saying that America needs it — as well as the Panama Canal — for 'economic security.' Amid intense kickback from Denmark — a NATO ally of which Greenland is an autonomous territory — and other countries, it’s worth looking in more detail at the significance of the island, which is one of the world’s largest, in economic, geostrategic, and, above all, military terms. Trump’s interest in Greenland has made headlines in recent days, although his designs on the territory are far from new. Back in 2019, TWZ reported on President Trump’s claim that his administration was considering attempting to purchase Greenland from Denmark, the U.S. leader noting at the time that the idea was 'strategically interesting.' Since then, Trump’s territorial ambitions for Greenland (and elsewhere) have been ramped up several notches. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump arrives to speak to members of the media during a press conference at the Mar-a-Lago Club on January 7, 2025, in Palm Beach, Florida. Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images Scott Olson Speaking at a press conference yesterday, the incoming U.S. president refused to rule out military or economic coercion to bring Greenland and the Panama Canal under U.S. control. 'I can’t assure you on either of those two,' Trump told reporters. 'But I can say this, we need them for economic security.' The same day, Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., touched down in Greenland for what was described as a tourist visit, during which he reportedly handed out hats bearing the slogan ‘Make Greenland Great Again.’ Donald Trump Jr. leaves Nuuk, Greenland, on January 7, 2025.

Photo by Emil Stach / Ritzau Scanpix / AFP EMIL STACH Talking about Greenland specifically, Trump threatened economic retaliation against Denmark, should the Scandinavian country — a NATO member — stand in the way of his territorial ambitions. Faced with such resistance, the United States 'would tariff Denmark at a very high level,' Trump said. Similar threats were leveled at Canada, too, where Trump said he would not rule out using 'economic force' to turn America’s northern neighbor into a U.S. state. NEW: Donald Trump has posted an image of a map depicting Canada as part of the USA pic.twitter.com/YAHpq2T3gT&mdash; Politics Global (@PolitlcsGlobal) January 8, 2025 In Denmark, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen yesterday ruled out the possibility of coming to a deal with the United States that would see Greenland handed over. Instead, the future of the territory would be decided by its people. 'Greenland is not for sale,' Frederiksen said. As to what the United States would be acquiring, should it somehow take control of Greenland, by whatever means, this territory is undoubtedly unique and it’s also at the center of an increasingly strategic race to expand control and military influence across the Arctic region. With Russia actively building up its military footprint in the wider region, it’s worth recalling that the United States already operates one of its most strategic military outposts in Greenland. Indeed, the U.S. military has for the better part of a century had a major military presence in Greenland, with the permission of the Danish government. A satellite view of Pituffik Space Force Base in Greenland. Google Earth As we’ve explored in the past, the current relationship dates back to the early years of the Cold War, driven by the standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union and the enduring military significance of Greenland. A U.S. military presence in Greenland can be traced back to before the superpower standoff, however. During World War II, when Denmark was under Nazi German occupation, an agreement was made with the Danish Ambassador to the United States that would allow the U.S. military to defend Danish settlements in Greenland from German forces, if required. After the German defeat, Denmark made efforts to remove the U.S. military presence but gave up once it joined NATO as a founding member in 1949. From this point onward, the relatively short distance between Greenland and the communist foe meant that the territory was an ideal springboard for launching U.S. nuclear strikes on the Soviet Union, as well as for basing early warning radars and interceptor fighters that, in turn, could help counter a Soviet attack. A year after the Alliance was established, the U.S. Air Force secretly began work on Thule Air Base in Greenland, which became the most significant military installation in the territory. Commencing operations in 1952, Thule Air Base was a critical installation during the Cold War, hosting Strategic Air Command bomber and reconnaissance aircraft, as well as interceptors and Nike nuclear-tipped surface-to-air missiles. 74th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron’s F-89s at Thule Air Base, Greenland, in 1955. U.S. Air Force via Wikicommons The Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS) came to Greenland in 1961, when the BMEWS-Site 1 was established there, initially designated as the 12th Missile Warning Squadron and later the 12th Missile Warning Group. Air Force Space Command assumed control of Thule Air Base in 1983 and the unit was re-designated as the 12th Space Warning Squadron in 1992. In 1987, the BMEWS mechanical radar was upgraded to the more efficient and capable solid-state, phased-array system used today, the Upgraded Early Warning Radar (UEWR). A satellite view of Site J, or J-Site, the sprawling radar station that sits on a bluff northeast of what is now Pituffik Air Base. Google Earth The Cold War years were turbulent ones for Greenland and Thule Air Base and the outlying facilities saw more than their fair share of bizarre endeavors — as well as at least one incident that could have ended in nuclear catastrophe. Between 1959 and 1967, the secretive Camp Century research facility, 150 miles east of Thule Air Base, ran experiments in running military operations on the Greenland Ice Cap, which included a nuclear reactor below the ice. This also fed into Project Iceworm, a plan to construct a system of tunnels 2,500 miles in length, which could be used to launch 600 ‘Iceman’ missiles, modified two-stage Minuteman Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs), providing a ‘second-strike’ capability against the Soviet Union. You can read more about this outlandish unrealized scheme here. Camp Century left a toxic legacy of buried weapons, sewage, fuel, and pollutants under the ice and there are potentially even more hazardous pollutants hidden here too, after Thule Air Base became the site of one of America’s worst nuclear accidents. In 1968, a cabin fire broke out in a B-52G bomber carrying four thermonuclear gravity bombs. The B-52 crashed onto sea ice in North Star Bay just west of the air base, with at least three of the weapons likely exploding on impact. Seven of the eight crewmembers survived the crash. SSgt Calvin Snapp, one of the crew in the B-52 accident in 1968, being rescued after ejecting onto the Greenland ice sheet. Public domain No nuclear detonations resulted, but the surrounding area was nonetheless covered with radioactive materials, while burning fuel and explosives melted the ice sheet, meaning that significant quantities of debris fell to the ocean floor. Project Crested Ice was launched to try and clean up the nuclear mess, although at least one of the thermonuclear weapons may still be unaccounted for. Until today, there are conflicting accounts of whether the entire bomb went missing, or whether it was a part of one of the fissile cores. These incidents were somewhat forgotten after the end of the Cold War but have been brought back into focus as the Arctic ice continues to retreat under the effects of climate change. Meanwhile, following its formal transfer to the U.S. Space Force in 2020, Thule Air Base was renamed Pituffik (pronounced bee-doo-FEEK) Space Base in 2023. U.S. Space Force While the strategic significance of the air base waned after the end of the Cold War, the developing geopolitical situation in the Arctic has seen it become much more important again. What hasn’t changed is the inhospitable nature of this remote operating environment, located well above the Arctic Circle and just 947 miles from the North Pole. In winter, temperatures here fall to as low as -47 degrees Fahrenheit while winds of up to 100 knots whip across the facility. Between November and February, the base is in constant darkness, while the sun never sets during the summer months of May to August. Different storm conditions are depicted in an orientation document for personnel arriving at the base formerly known as Thule, now Pituffik. Pentagon document Today, operations at Pituffik Space Base are overseen by the Space Force’s 821st Space Base Group, the mission of which is 'to enable force projection, space superiority, and scientific research in the Arctic region for our nation and allies through integrated base support and defense operations,' according to the Space Force. With Pituffik Space Base, the 821st Space Base Group is responsible for the U.S. military’s northernmost installation but also the world's northernmost deep-water seaport, and a number of subordinate squadrons, as follows: 821st Support Squadron: provides mission support in the form of engineering, medical, communication, logistics, services, and airfield operations in support of the 821 Space Base Group and tenant organizations. 821st Security Forces Squadron: handles security of the 254-square-mile defense area in and around Pituffik. The area includes a ballistic missile early warning system, satellite control and tracking facilities, the air base, and the seaport which is only accessible for a short period during the summer. An annual sealift operation to support the base during this period is called Operation Pace Goose. 12th Space Warning Squadron: responsible for the AN/FPS-132 Upgraded Early Warning Radar (UEWR) system, a phased-array radar that detects and reports attack assessments of sea-launched and intercontinental ballistic missile threats heading toward North America. A secondary mission of the squadron is providing space surveillance data on satellites and other near-Earth objects like asteroids.

Located approximately 3.5 miles northeast of the Pituffik main base, Det 1 provides telemetry, tracking, and command and control operations to the United States and allied government satellite programs. While Pituffik is now primarily host to these various space and missile warning missions, fighter detachments are also making a comeback, reflecting one of the core Cold War missions for what was then still known as Thule Air Base. Regular flying operations include Vigilant Shield, an annual, binational air defense training event staged with the Canadian military. In 2023, while it was still named Thule Air Base, the facility welcomed for the first time a detachment of U.S. Air Force F-35A stealth fighters, where they took part in a North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) exercise that you can read more about here.

Benjamin Wiseman The strategic value of Pituffik Space Base and its early warning mission means that it would be one of the first U.S. military installations to be targeted in the event of a nuclear exchange with Russia. While such a scenario was part of the everyday Cold War reality, it’s something that appears more possible as Greenland again finds itself in the middle of another standoff between East and West. In some respects, Trump’s preoccupation with Greenland reflects the degree to which the United States has, in recent years, lagged far behind Russia when it comes to establishing a more permanent footprint above the Arctic Circle — let alone in terms of more temporary operations in the region. Thule Air Base in 2005. Public domain Meanwhile, Russia has placed a huge strategic importance on the Arctic, with many investments in the region. In recent years, Moscow has been heavily committed to increasing its air and naval power in the Arctic Circle and has been establishing new bases in the region, as well as reactivating ones that fell into disuse after the Cold War. For some years now, Russia has enjoyed access to over 50 airfields and ports in the Arctic region, from where it is able to project air and naval power that could deny the United States and its allies access to the Arctic. Russian maritime activity in the region is also enabled to a significant degree by a large and growing fleet of icebreakers, which dwarfs that used by the United States and its allies combined. If anything, the strategic importance of the Arctic region as a whole has the potential to be a good deal greater than it was during the decades of superpower standoff, driven by climate change opening up new shipping routes as well as providing access to natural resources that were previously inaccessible, or at least much harder to exploit. A Russian MiG-31BM Foxhound interceptors at Rogachevo Air Base in the Novaya Zemlya archipelago, above the Arctic Circle. Russian Ministry of Defense The importance of new shipping routes shouldn’t be underestimated. After all, whoever is able to control new lanes for commercial shipping and maritime traffic between Asian markets and Europe and North America will be able to dictate the terms of international trade in the Arctic. While the Cold War rendered the Arctic a critical zone in terms of military strategy, the continued retreat of the sea ice in the region means that it is becoming increasingly important for economic development. Having maritime commerce traverse the Arctic will slash the journey times and costs of moving goods around the northern hemisphere. Meanwhile, resources in the wider region should provide new opportunities for undersea oil drilling, the mining of rare earth metals from the sea floor, and access to lucrative fisheries, to name just a few. It’s therefore no surprise that the leading powers are now jostling for position in the Arctic, with a military presence seen as vital to secure strategic access and natural resources. NATO — including the United States, Canada, and Denmark — has long identified the Arctic as a region of 'great power competition.' This rivalry now includes not only NATO and Russia but increasingly China, too. With an eye on new shipping routes and natural resources, Beijing has been expanding its presence in the Arctic, and, in response to this, the Pentagon has defined the Arctic as 'an increasingly competitive domain,' issuing specific warnings about China’s growing interest in the Arctic, including Greenland. The Chinese icebreaker Xue Long lowers equipment to the Arctic ice. Public domain The Pentagon is also increasingly worried that, despite the potential for competition between them, China and Russia could cooperate on an Arctic strategy to the detriment of the United States. Indeed, there is major military cooperation already exists between China and Russia, especially in the naval space — and with a unique emphasis on the Arctic. There’s little doubt that the geopolitical importance of the Arctic — and with it, Greenland — is only set to increase. Thanks to its geographic location, Greenland is already of critical importance to the United States. Not only does the country’s security rely to a significant degree on missile detection and tracking capabilities in Greenland, but having a military foothold here provides unrivaled access to the Arctic, in the sea and air domains. Were the United States to control Greenland or at least have greater freedom to expand its military presence there, it would be a logical outpost from which it could challenge Russia and China in the region. At the very least, its potential as a major logistics hub could be further enhanced, allowing the U.S. military to extend its reach further over the Arctic. The ramp at what was then known as Thule Air Base. U.S. Air Force Alongside its support and surveillance functions, Greenland already provides the U.S. military with a logistics staging post, but it could also accommodate new command and control capabilities. Potentially, it could see a return to the basing of U.S. Air Force bombers and fighters, even on a permanent basis, if this is judged necessary. Echoing the previous practices, it could be used once again to station air defenses, to provide a forward line of defense against Russian bombers and missiles, although these could now include ballistic ones. There is even the possibility that the United States might choose to have long-range ground-based strike capabilities in Greenland, a Cold War throwback that is already poised to return to Western Europe, albeit in the form of conventional and not nuclear-armed missiles. Expanded port access in Greenland would also provide valuable and highly strategic maritime power projection points into the Arctic, as well as the North Atlantic. Those ports could be especially useful as operating locations for icebreakers. A U.S. Navy Mk 70-series launch system — capable of accommodating SM-6 multi-purpose missiles — mounted on a trailer deployed during an exercise in Denmark in September 2023. U.S. Navy A reinforced U.S. military presence in Greenland would very likely also address capabilities for a potential land war with Russia here and in the wider region. Due to its geographical position and its extremely limited means of repelling a ground invasion, Greenland is today could be considered a soft target by some. This is compounded by the fact that, while the U.S. Army is only slowly returning to more robust preperations for warfare in Arctic conditions, Russia is far more capable of fighting in northern latitudes and is introducing a variety of weapons systems that are optimized for just this kind of environment. Russian troops test a Chaborz M-3 combat buggy modified for Arctic operations. Russian Ministry of Defense screencap One more legacy of the Cold War that has made a resurgence in recent years is Russian submarine operations, with a focus on the Arctic and North Atlantic, with Greenland in a highly strategic position. The vital Greenland, Iceland, United Kingdom Gap, better known as the GIUK Gap, is a critical bottleneck through which Russian (and before them Soviet) submarines need to pass to effectively patrol the North Atlantic. During the Cold War, a significant portion of NATO naval power in Europe was dedicated to closely monitoring the GIUK Gap, and hunting submarines would have been a top priority in wartime. With Russia operating increasingly capable submarines, the GIUK Gap is once again of fundamental importance, and having anti-submarine warfare capabilities in Greenland would further bolster this effort. Dating from the Cold War but still relevant today, a map of the GIUK Gap. CIA.gov So far, the United States has relied on cooperation with the Danish government to ensure that it retains a significant foothold in Greenland. Although this hasn’t always been entirely without problems, Denmark and the United States — as NATO members — have broadly aligned interests in the region, officially at least. Conceivably, the United States could potentially accomplish most of its strategic aims in Greenland via this same relationship, rather than taking over the island and claiming ownership of it. Already today, it seems the Pentagon was seeking to distance itself from a potential seizure of Greenland. At a press conference, U.S. Department of Defense spokesperson Sabrina Singh said she was not aware of any military plans draft for a Greenland invasion, and said that the department is focused on more immediate matters. 'We’re concerned with the real national security concerns that confront this building every single day,' she said. The view from the flight deck of a Royal Danish Air Force C-130J transport during a mission over Greenland. Royal Danish Air Force It remains to be seen whether the looming military competition in the Arctic region and the drive to compete with Russia and China in this remote corner of the world means that Greenland remains in Trump’s sights during his second term in office. Regardless, the potential for Greenland as a cornerstone of America’s military strategy in the Arctic is clear, whatever form that takes.

Stealthy AGM-158C Long-Range Anti-Ship Missiles To Arm F-15EX, F-...	The arsenals of the U.S. Air Force's F-15E Strike Eagle and F-15EX Eagle II combat jets look set to grow with the addition of stealthy AGM-158C Long-Range Anti-Ship Missiles (LRASMs). F-15Es and EXs armed with LRASMs would give the Air Force a major boost in its ability to engage enemy warships, which could be particularly valuable in any future high-end fight in the Pacific against China. The U.S. Navy's Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) announced its intention to negotiate a sole-source contract with Lockheed Martin, the prime contractor for LRASM, to integrate the C-1 variant of the missile onto the F-15E and EX earlier today. The Navy manages the LRASM program on the U.S. military side. The AGM-158C-1 is the main subvariant of the LRASM in production now. An extended-range version of the missile, the AGM-158C-3, able to fly roughly twice as far (around 600 miles versus 200-300 miles based on available information), which will also feature other improvements, is now in development. An AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) in flight. USAF Navy F/A-18E/F Super Hornets and Air Force B-1 bombers are the two available launch platforms for LRASM now. Work is already underway to integrate the missiles onto the Navy's P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol plane and at least some variants of the stealthy F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Integrating the AGM-158C now onto Air Force F-15E and EX makes good sense. The Strike Eagle and other F-15 variants in that extended family can employ non-stealthy and far shorter-ranged Harpoon anti-ship missiles, but it's unclear if the Air Force has those weapons available for F-15E units now and/or if they actively train to employ them. The Air Force's Strike Eagles are already a platform of choice for employing members of the AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) family on air-launched land-attack cruise missiles from which the LRASM was derived. The EX has demonstrated its ability to employ JASSMs, as well. An F-15EX loaded with a JASSM, as well as a number of AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM). USAF One of the US Air Force's two F-15EXs seen loaded with a mixture of AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) and AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) cruise missiles. This underscores the aircraft's significant payload capacity. USAF The large overall payload capacity of the Strike Eagle and the Eagle II should also allow a single one of either of the jets to carry a significant number of AGM-158C at once. The Air Force has test-loaded five JASSMs, which have the same external form factor as the LRASM, onto a single F-15E in the past. An F-15E loaded with five JASSMs during a test. USAF Just last year, Lockheed Martin, in cooperation with the Navy, conducted what appeared to be a first-of-its-kind test that saw four LRASMs fly simultaneously. TWZ noted at the time that this was representative of how the missiles would actually be employed in combat. A single F-15E or EX could well be able to unleash a volley like this at one or multiple maritime targets. LRASMs already offer a high degree of survivability thanks to their stealth design and highly autonomous route-planning capability tied to an onboard electronic support measures (ESM) suite. The missiles can automatically change course in response to the sudden appearance of enemy defenses, as well as better detect their targets via their radio-frequency emissions. In addition, they use a passive imaging infrared sensor in the terminal phase of flight, which does not send out radio-frequency signals that an enemy could detect and is immune to radio-frequency jamming. It can also visually decipher different targets by comparing them to its onboard database and strike them in the most vulnerable spots. An onboard datalink also means AGM-158Cs can receive additional threat updates from offboard sources as they head toward their targets, as well as work cooperatively with other LRASMs for more coordinated strikes. F-15Es and F-15EXs, which also have significant combat range thanks in part to conformal fuel tanks and large internal fuel load, armed with LRASM would also increase the U.S. military's overall capacity to launch aerial anti-ship strikes across large swathes of a future battlespace. This could be particularly important in a future major conflict in the Pacific with China's People's Liberation Army (PLA), which continues to add larger and otherwise more modern surface warships to its already substantial combat fleets. Launch capacity is only one part of the equation and there are growing concerns about the adequacy of American stockpiles of stand-off munitions like the AGM-158C and the ability to replenish them during a sustained fight. LRASM is one of a number of weapons the U.S. military is looking to buy significantly more of going forward and Lockheed Martin is taking steps to ramp up production. In addition, expanding the arsenals of the F-15E and EX can only re-raise questions about the Air Force's desire to slash the Strike Eagle fleet and truncate purchases of new Eagle IIs. TWZ has previously explored in depth how the current expected F-15EX fleet size is too small to allow commanders to get the most out of the added capabilities the jets have to offer. The Air Force currently expects to use the Eagle II primarily for air-to-air combat missions, but the groundwork is already being laid to add air-to-ground to the portfolio of units equipped with the jets. Other missions, like launching specialized outsized weapons and controlling drones are also being examined. An F-15EX with a loadout of AIM-120s reflecting its primary air-to-air role, at least initially. USAF Exactly what the estimated timeline is for the integration of the AGM-158C-1 onto the F-15E and EX is also unclear and will depend in part on when the contract with Lockheed Martin is finalized. Still, a major boost to the anti-ship capabilities of the Strike Eagle and Eagle II is now on the horizon.

Ukraine Targets Strategic Bomber Fuel Supplies In Long-Range Stri...	Russian authorities have declared a state of emergency in the Volga River port city of Engels as a huge fire, caused by a 'massive' Ukrainian drone attack, rages unchecked. The strike was on the strategically important fuel storage tank farm for Engels Air Base, the Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff said on Facebook. It’s the home of the 22nd Heavy Bomber Aviation Division and its Tu-22M3 Backfire-C, Tu-95MS Bear-H, and Tu-160M Blackjack bombers, located about 300 miles east of the border. 'Due to the increase in the area of ​​the fire at the industrial enterprise that was attacked by a UAV, a state of emergency will be introduced in Engels,' Roman Busargin, governor of Saratov region, said Wednesday on Telegram. 'Unfortunately, as a result of the liquidation, there are two fatalities - employees of the fire service of the Ministry of Emergency Situations. Also, one specialist was hospitalized.

The attack was clearly designed to impact the ability of the base to generate bomber sorties. With the fire still raging, the full extent of the damage is unknown, but it is highly likely that the bombers' fuel reserves are greatly affected. Engels Air Base is located about 300 miles east of Ukraine. (Google Earth) The fuel facility attacked today, seen in the bottom left corner of this image, is about five miles west of Engels Air Base. (Google Earth) 'Worth noting, while the Tu-95MS consumes conventional types of jet fuel (T-1, TS, RT), the Tu-160, on the other hand, requires special high-density fuel of the T-8V brand,' the Ukrainian Defense Express media outlet reported. 'Considering the limited attainability of the T-8V fuel, if tanks containing it were destroyed by drones tonight, Russian Tu-160 could be grounded completely or significantly limited in their operations.' The Blackjacks are already being used sparingly 'due to their limited numbers and ongoing modernization efforts,' Defense Express pointed out. 'Russia’s Aerospace Forces reportedly possess around 15 Tu-160 aircraft, though not all are operational. Some are being upgraded to the Tu-160M aircraft standard, with Moscow aiming to expand the fleet to 20 aircraft by completing unfinished Soviet-era airframes, a goal widely viewed as uncertain.' 'The last time these aircraft were involved in an attack was on November 17, 2024, which was the first time they had been used in 550 days,' the publication added.

(Photo by DMITRY AZAROV/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) The aircraft at the base have been targeted several times in the past, causing the Russians to beef up their air defenses, use silhouette decoys, and even place tires on the planes there to protect them from attack by confusing image-matching missile seekers. However, Ukrainian officials said today’s attack was part of their ongoing effort to target Russian fuel supplies to reduce Russia's capacity to fight. 'Oil base [attacks] create serious logistical problems for Russian occupiers' strategic aviation and significantly reduces their ability to strike peaceful Ukrainian cities and civilian objects,' the Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff noted on Facebook. Alexander Kamyshin, an advisor to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, lauded the fact that Ukraine used its own long-range weapons in the attack. He did not specify which ones. 'Yet another russian oil depot, serving military airfield, was hit by long range capabilities #MadeInUkraine,' he stated. Our 'DefenseTech is our superpower.'

Lack Of Hardened Aircraft Shelters Leaves U.S. Airbases Vulnerabl...	A new independent report says that U.S. airbases have been left worryingly vulnerable, especially in the Indo-Pacific region, by a lack of investment in new hardened aircraft shelters, or even unhardened ones. In contrast, the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) has more than doubled its total number of hardened and unhardened aircraft shelters in the past 15 years or so, along with a major expansion of other airbase infrastructure. Other countries, including Russia, are increasingly doing the same. This comes amid an increasingly heated debate between the U.S. military and Congress over the right mix of active and passive base defenses needed to succeed in a future high-end conflict, such as one against China in the Pacific, which TWZ has been following closely. The Hudson Institute think tank in Washington, D.C., published the report, titled 'Concrete Sky: Air Base Hardening in the Western Pacific,' yesterday. Its primary authors are Hudson's Timothy Walton and Thomas Shugart from the Center for a New American Security (CNAS), a separate think tank. I'm pleased to announce the release of a new report I co-authored with @timothyawalton for @HudsonInstitute titled Concrete Sky: Air Base Hardening in the Western Pacific. pic.twitter.com/zRenm6y0VV&mdash; Tom Shugart (@tshugart3) January 7, 2025 'The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) has consistently expressed concern regarding threats to airfields in the Indo-Pacific, and military analyses of potential conflicts involving China and the United States demonstrate that the overwhelming majority of US aircraft losses would likely occur on the ground at airfields (and that the losses could be ruinous),' the report says in its executive summary. 'But the U.S. military has devoted relatively little attention, and few resources, to countering these threats compared to developing modern aircraft.' By the report's accounting, the U.S. military has added two hardened aircraft shelters (HAS) and 41 of what it refers to as 'unhardened individual aircraft shelters (IASs),' at airbases within 1,000 miles of the Taiwan Strait since the early 2010s. Expansion of those same facilities has been otherwise limited, with the addition of only one runway, one major taxiway, and 17 percent more ramp area overall. 'Since the early 2010s, the PLA has more than doubled its hardened aircraft shelters (HASs) and unhardened individual aircraft shelters (IASs) at military airfields, giving China more than 3,000 total aircraft shelters — not including civil or commercial airfields,' the new report from Hudson says. 'This constitutes enough shelters to house and hide the vast majority of China’s combat aircraft.

'As a result, China now has 134 air bases within 1,000 nautical miles of the Taiwan Strait — airfields that boast more than 650 HASs and almost 2,000 non-hardened IASs.'

This is just one example of China's massive airbase construction push in the past two decades mentioned in Hudson's new report.

Maxar via USAF The report does acknowledge that IASs do not provide anywhere near the same level of protection as true HASs, which are costlier. It also makes clear that shelters, hardened or otherwise, are just one part of a larger base defense equation. However, its authors argue that robust passive defenses are the most cost-effective single measure that can be taken to provide critical added resiliency against attacks and help provide a key foundation for other concepts of operations. Hudson's report estimates that buying just one fewer B-21 every year for the next five years could free up enough funds to construct 100 HASs. A similar reduction in purchases of F-15EXs or F-35As could yield the resources required to build 20 more HASs annually. The estimated unit cost of the B-21 is pegged at between $600 and $800 million based on publicly available information. As of 2023, the price tag for a single F-15EX was nearly $94 million, while the average unit cost across all three variants of the F-35 was said to be around $82.5 million.

In addition, 'while non-hardened IASs do not provide the same degree of protection as HASs, some of them may provide at least partial protection from shrapnel,' the report adds. 'IASs may also make it more difficult to determine the number and types of aircraft at a base, potentially masking a pre-conflict surge of aircraft, and make both strike planning and post-strike damage assessment more challenging.' As TWZ has highlighted in the past, the ability to better shield planes exposed out on the flight line even from more limited threats like shrapnel, including that produced by relatively small warheads on kamikaze drones and cluster munitions, is still very valuable. By targeting aircraft sitting out in the open, an adversary could well prevent them from ever entering the fight, even with limited attacks, such as ones involving weaponized commercial drones. Ukrainian attacks on Russian airbases using drones and U.S.-supplied Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) short-range ballistic missiles with cluster warheads have helped drive this reality home. In turn, Russia has launched its own new push to build hardened and other shelters at various air bases, especially those close to Ukraine.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION In addition, 'passive defenses' include 'not only hardening, but also redundancy measures, prepositioning of supplies, reconstitution capabilities, and camouflage, concealment, and deception measures,' the new report notes. Furthermore, while 'passive defenses may seem at odds with a predominantly expeditionary U.S. approach to warfare &#8230; unless U.S. forces can defend airfields at home and abroad, they will be unable to support US and allied interests in a conflict.' As illustrated below, Hudson's report assesses that it could take just 10 missiles with warheads capable of scattering cluster munitions across an area with a 450-foot diameter to neutralize all exposed aircraft on the ground and fuel storage at key airbases like Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni in Japan, Naval Support Facility Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, or Langley Air Force Base in Virginia. Hudson Institute The report also highlights the ever-growing threat posed by drones, and how uncrewed systems and missiles could threaten airbases within the continental United States, as well as overseas. For years now, TWZ has been sounding the alarm on these issues, especially when it comes to the dangers of increasingly more capable drones that are steadily proliferating globally, and noting the continued lag on the part of the U.S. military in addressing them. 'Recent Air Force requests for information about 'enclosures to defend F-15Es from drone attacks' at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base and F-22 jets at Langley Air Force Base suggest the Air Force is starting to consider the threat more seriously,' Hudson's report notes, directly citing some of TWZ's past reporting. 'However, it is again pursuing low-cost solutions (such as canvassing existing open-air shelters or applying nets), which counter-measures such as shaped charges can easily overcome, rather [than] building proper HASs.' A graphic offering general details about the sunshade-type shelters at Langley that could be in line to receive new anti-drone nets. USAF Still unexplained drone incursions over Langley that continued for several weeks in December 2023, which TWZ was first to report, became a particular watershed moment for the discourse around drone threats, including to domestic U.S. military bases. Drone incursions over bases hosting U.S. forces in Europe last year, as well as widespread drone sightings over New Jersey and elsewhere in the United States that have increasingly tended toward hysteria, have further reinforced the reality about the potential threats in the public consciousness. The issue of hardening and limited investments in new HASs and other passive defenses in the past 20 years, also extends to U.S. allies and partners in the Western Pacific, the report points out. South Korea, which faces the immediate prospect of potential attacks from North Korea, is the notable outlier. Earlier this month, the Japanese Ministry of Defense announced plans to start moving 14 key command centers underground to better shield them, especially from potential Chinese attacks in the event of a larger conflict over Taiwan, as part of its proposed budget for the 2025 Fiscal Year. Hudson Institute As already noted, the report from Hudson stresses that HASs and other infrastructure improvements are not a 'silver bullet' solution. It also includes two other recommended lines of effort centered on a potential conflict with China in the Pacific. The report also calls for increasing the ability of U.S. forces to similarly hold Chinese bases and other critical infrastructure, including facilities deep inside the country, at risk. That, among other things, will require increasing the production and stockpiling of strike munitions, and the development of types that are cheaper and easier to produce at scale. This has long been its own hot-button issue for the U.S. military and is only more so now amid planning for a potential high-end fight with China. Improving the U.S. military's ability to project air power from far-flung locations, and without the need for long runways or runways at all, or simply to have aircraft capable of longer-range operations from bases that are less vulnerable to start with, is the other recommended course of action in the report. TWZ has been increasingly highlighting the potential value of crewed and uncrewed aircraft with greater, if not total runway independence, as well as new concepts in aerial refueling, in future major conflicts, especially across the broad expanses of the Pacific. How the U.S. Air Force and the rest of the U.S. military might actually proceed, especially when it comes to base infrastructure, remains to be seen. Last month, the Air Force notably released a new base modernization strategy that included a focus area on increased resiliency and that pointedly said that the services facilities 'can no longer be considered a sanctuary.' However, it did not explicitly mention HASs or similar passive defensive measures, last month. Air Force officials have also pushed back on the value of more extensive physical hardening in the past. 'I’m not a big fan of hardening infrastructure,' Gen. Kenneth Wilsbach, then head of Pacific Air Forces, the top Air Force command for that region, said at a roundtable at the 2023 Air and Space Forces Association symposium. 'The reason is because of the advent of precision-guided weapons… you saw what we did to the Iraqi Air Force and their hardened aircraft shelters. They’re not so hard when you put a 2,000-pound bomb right through the roof.' Air Force ground crew personnel tow an F-117 Nighthawk stealth combat jet past a destroyed hardened aircraft shelter at Ahmad Al Jaber Air Base in Kuwait in 1998. U.S. forces had knocked out this shelter during the first Gulf War in 1991. DOD Hudson's report includes an entire section rebutting arguments like Wilsbach's, including highlighting how physical hardening would force the PLA to expend more and better weapons in attacks on airbases to try to ensure success. The report also highlights how other countries beyond China, including Russia, North Korea, and Israel, are also very actively investing in new hardened airbase infrastructure. There are various policy and other hurdles to improving active air and missile defenses around airbases and other critical facilities abroad and at home. This includes the fact that the U.S. Army is currently the lead service responsible for performing that mission at Air Force bases. Top Air Force officials have said they are open to taking on that responsibility as long as it comes with commensurate additional funding. Lengthy traditional contracting processes and concerns about future U.S. defense budgets, together with competing priorities, present additional issues. The Air Force has been increasingly warning about the affordability of various new advanced aircraft and other modernization efforts, including plans for a new sixth-generation stealth combat jet, Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones, and new stealthy tankers, for months now. 'To comprehensively harden airfields, the DoD [Department of Defense] will need to shift from treating each construction project individually to conducting a campaign of construction,' Hudson's report says. 'When facing similar challenges in the past, the DoD addressed them, building 373 HASs in Vietnam over a three-year period and roughly 1,000 HASs in Europe in the 1980s. With decisive action, the DoD can address this problem.' USAF In the meantime, while the debate in the United States about the value of HASs and other physical defenses continues, China is vastly outpacing the U.S. military in this regard and other countries are also taking note.

Cost Of Navy’s Newest Arleigh Burke Destroyers Is Ballooning	The U.S. Navy’s Flight III Arleigh Burke (DDG-51) class destroyers are facing cost increases and delays, jumping from an average of $2.1 billion per ship to $2.5 billion per hull, with even steeper cost increases coming in the future, according to a new Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report. The report analyzes the Navy’s 2025 shipbuilding plan, which calls for a 390-battle force ship fleet by 2054, and includes nine more vessels than in last year’s plan. Beyond destroyers, the versatile workhorses of the Navy’s combat fleet, the CBO’s assessment notes cost hikes among other platforms, as well as systemic American shipbuilding industry shortfalls that could impede the service’s fleet size goal. All this long-term planning comes as the sea service races to prepare for a near-term war with China if Beijing invades Taiwan in the coming years. These destroyers and their anti-air, anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare capabilities would be crucial to such a future fight. A graphic from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) assessment of the Navy's latest 30-year shipbuilding plan. (Congressional Budget Office) The Navy currently has 74 destroyers of the Areligh Burke class, in Flight I, Flight II, Flight IIA and Flight III variants. Two Flight IIAs and 18 Flight IIIs are already either under construction or their purchase has been already authorized by Congress. CBO’s assessment also found that, overall, the 23 Flight IIIs laid out in the 30-year shipbuilding plan will end up costing $2.7 billion on average. 'The Navy stated in a briefing to CBO and [the Congressional Research Service] that the increase in its estimates of the cost of the DDG-51 Flight IIIs was attributable to shipbuilding inflation’s outpacing economywide inflation as well as declining shipyard performance,' the CBO report states. The report added that the destroyers currently under construction 'have experienced substantial delays.' To date, just one Flight III destroyer, the USS Jack Lucas (DDG-125) has been commissioned, and the keel was laid for the second Flight III, the future USS Louis H. Wilson Jr. (DDG-126) in 2023. Inside Defense reported in June that other Flight III vessels could see six-to-25-month delivery delays. The Navy Flight III destroyer USS Jack H. Lucas (DDG-125), left, underway with the Australian Anzac class frigate HMAS Stuart (FFH-153) off Hawaii in March 2024. (U.S. Navy) The Flight III configuration is considered critical to Navy warfighting on the high seas going forward. It will feature the AN/SPY-6(V)1 air and missile defense radar, as well as upgraded electrical power and cooling capacity, among other enhancements. Flight IIIs will also take on the air warfare command ship mission currently handled by the Navy’s aging and shrinking Ticonderoga class cruiser fleet, which the Navy has been steadily retiring in recent years. Meanwhile, the Navy’s next-generation destroyer, dubbed DDG(X), is facing its own cost increases and delays, the CBO found. While the Navy is believed to still be refining its core requirements for the ship class, TWZ has reported in the past about that platform. The Navy’s 2025 shipbuilding plan called for production of those ships to commence in 2032, but the Navy later informed the CBO that the first ship actually wouldn’t begin production until 2034 or later. The Navy wants to eventually buy 28 DDG(X) ships at an average cost of $3.3 billion per ship, a price 'driven mostly by an increase in the size and capabilities' of the future warship, which would include a larger hull, more stealth capabilities, more power and a greater capacity to accommodate future systems, according to the CBO. But given the size and new tech onboard the DDG(X), CBO’s assessment states that those ships will actually cost $4.4 billion on average. A conceptual design of the U.S. Navy's future DDG(X) warship. (U.S. Navy) 'The uncertainty about the ultimate size and capabilities of the next-generation destroyer suggests that its final cost could differ substantially from both the Navy’s and CBO’s estimates,' the report states. The CBO assessment also casts doubt on the Navy’s estimate that the already-delayed Constellation class frigate (FFG-62) will cost $1 billion per ship, with the CBO estimating that the ships will instead come in at $1.4 billion per hull. Go here to read past TWZ coverage of the Constellation class’s 'unplanned weight growth' and other struggles. A rendering of the fourth planned Constellation class frigate, the future USS Lafayette. (U.S. Navy) A Navy shipbuilding review conducted in early 2024 highlighted several major programs that were running late, issues that TWZ has extensively reported on. These included an 18-to-26 month delay for the next Ford class carrier Enterprise (CVN-80), the first Columbia class ballistic missile sub being delayed 12 to 16 months, a three-year delay for the first Constellation class frigate and 24-to-36-month delays for Virginia class attack subs. The Virginia-class submarine USS Vermont (SSN-792). (U.S. Navy) The CBO’s report suggests that the Navy’s latest plan is based on the assumption that systemic shortfalls plaguing current shipbuilding efforts will improve. And while leaders have laid out some reforms, and lawmakers last month introduced the bipartisan SHIPS Act to revive American shipbuilding, it remains to be seen whether large-scale reform will take place. Go here to read TWZ’s in-depth assessment of the SHIPS Act legislation. 'The quantities of new ships purchased and the delivery times laid out in the Navy’s 2025 plan are predicated on the assumption that the production delays that several shipyards are currently experiencing will be resolved in the next decade, leading to the steady and on-time delivery of new ships in the future,' the report states. All told, the CBO report highlights several other challenges in American shipbuilding, as well as budgetary uncertainties, that could impact the Navy’s ability to field a 390-ship battle force fleet by 2054. The fleet currently stands at 295 ships, while China’s fast-growing naval force numbers more than 370 vessels. The Pentagon warned last month that the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) is increasingly building ever-more capable warships and support ships that are enhancing the fleet’s global reach. The Chinese navy underway in the South China Sea. (STR/AFP via Getty Images) To hit that 390-ship target, the CBO found that new shipbuilding would cost $40 billion annually, 17 percent more than the Navy’s estimates. CBO attributed the gap to the fact that the Navy didn’t factor costs for refueling nuclear-powered vessels, 'outfitting new ships' after delivery or purchasing used sealift vessels, all of which are typically funded via the Navy’s shipbuilding account. There have been long-standing questions about the viability of the Navy’s long-term shipbuilding plans, particularly when it comes to not only building the fleet, but sustaining it. To operate and maintain this bigger fleet, while also buying new aircraft and other weapons, as well as funding the Marine Corps, the Department of the Navy’s total annual budget would need to balloon from its current $255 billion to $340 billion. The CBO also notes that the 2025 Navy plan would cost 46 percent more after adjusting for inflation than the average amount Congress appropriated to the sea service over the past five years. While the Navy received nearly $33 billion for shipbuilding in Fiscal Year 2024 alone, the CBO warns that such funding levels won’t suffice. 'According to the Navy’s estimates, even if the service received annual funding for shipbuilding from 2025 to 2054 that equaled the amount of such funding that it received in each of the past five years—a half-decade during which that funding was at its highest level since the 1980s—the service still could not afford to buy all the ships in its 2025 shipbuilding plan,' the report notes. Cost overruns in general are increasing, the CBO found. For example, in the president’s 2024 budget request, cost overrun funding totaled $3.4 billion for 2024 to 2028. Those cost overruns jumped to $10.4 billion in the 2025 request, according to the CBO. 'Unit cost estimates for attack submarines and destroyers are more than 20 percent higher than they were over the past five years,' the report states. 'Increased costs in the Virginia and Arleigh Burke class programs appear to have contributed to higher cost estimates for the SSN(X) next-generation attack submarines and the DDG(X) next-generation destroyer. Those higher costs are likely to affect the Navy’s estimates for Columbia class ballistic missile submarines as well, although the 2025 plan does not yet reflect them.' A Congressional Budget Office (CBO) graphic shows how costs for Navy ship programs are growing. (Congressional Budget Office) The CBO report notes that the U.S. shipbuilding industry would have to produce 'substantially more naval tonnage' than they have churned out in the past decade, and the rate of nuclear-powered submarine production in particular 'would need to increase significantly' to hit the 30-year fleet goal. While the amount of tonnage under construction at American shipyards increased by 80 percent over the last decade, it would have to increase even more, with submarines, surface combatants and amphibious warfare ships construction needing to increase by 50 percent on average compared to today, according to the CBO. The long decline of America’s shipbuilding industry largely involves a lack of capacity due to a lack of workers, according to Bradley Martin, a retired surface warfare officer and senior policy researcher with the RAND think tank. 'The Navy probably could not get more ships built [under present conditions], even if it had all the funding in the world to buy them,' Martin told TWZ on Tuesday. Whether these issues will change under President-elect Donald Trump’s second term remains unclear, but he bemoaned glacial American shipbuilding and delays during an interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt on Tuesday, and blamed the Biden administration for the woes of the Constellation class frigate program. 'We don’t build ships anymore,' Trump said. 'We want to get that started. And maybe we’ll use allies, also, in terms of building ships. We might have to. We need ships. China’s building, from what I’m hearing, every four days, they’re knocking out a ship. And we’re sitting back watching.' President-elect Donald Trump has criticized U.S. Navy shipbuilding policies under his predecessor. (Getty Images) While American warships must by law be built domestically, the Navy has explored enlisting Korean and Japanese shipyards to repair U.S. ships in the future, as those foreign yards turn out ships faster and cheaper than in the states. On the sustainment side, South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean secured a contract in August to overhaul a 40,000-ton U.S. Navy logistics support ship at its Busan facility, a deal believed to be the first of its kind, Breaking Defense’s Justin Katz reported. Looking to foreign shipyards reflects the suboptimal state of American yards. While China has more than 46 percent of the global shipbuilding market and is the largest builder, the U.S. has just 0.13 percent, retired Marine Corps Maj. Jeffrey Seavy noted in the U.S. Naval Institute’s Proceedings publication in April. 'Close allies like Japan and [South Korea] have excellent shipbuilding capacity and capability,' Jan van Tol, a retired warship commander and senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments think tank, told TWZ. 'It is very regrettable that Congress would almost surely refuse to let the Navy buy ships from them. I would love to get a dozen Mogami-class frigates to help boost [U.S. Navy] numbers fairly quickly.' Japan pumps out four of those frigates annually, he added. The Japanese destroyer JS Mogami (FFM-1). (Japan Ministry of Defense) This week’s CBO report also raises questions about whether the planned fleet expansion will come too late. While the CBO analyzes the Navy’s plan to grow its fleet over the next three decades, American military leaders have warned that China’s military plans to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027, a geopolitical red line that would likely provoke an American military response. If Beijing actually moves on Taiwan in 2027 or soon after, the Navy’s latest shipbuilding plan sees the battle force fleet actually dipping to a low of 283 ships that year, if the current retirement schedule is followed. 'This plan looks out to 2054, but there is obviously a near-term force size issue as well, given the rising threat in WESTPAC,' van Tol noted. Government decisions dating back to the end of the Cold War have led to today’s Navy scrambling to catch up with China on the naval warfare front. Many of the issues laid out by CBO have been recurring problems for the sea service, and while its brass may want a bigger fleet, a variety of factors continue to stand in the way of it ever reaching that goal.

Ukraine Claims Its Drone Boats Are Now Launching Kamikaze FPV Dro...	Ukraine has claimed that it’s successfully used uncrewed surface vessels (USV), better known as drone boats, to launch aerial drones against Russian targets for the first time. According to Ukrainian authorities, the first-person view (FPV) drones were employed in combat during strikes on Russian ground-based air defense systems. This is the latest development in Ukraine’s Black Sea drone war, which is seeing increasingly innovative use of uncrewed systems, including adapted air-to-air missiles launched from USVs against Russian aircraft. The latest strikes were said to have been carried out by the Ukrainian Navy, which published a video of one of the attacks — which occurred yesterday — against a Pantsir-S1 short-range air defense system (SHORADS). The extent of the damage to the vehicle is not immediately clear, based on this footage. While not independently verified, Russian military bloggers have also stated that Ukraine is now using USVs to launch FPV drones in attacks on targets close to the Black Sea coast.

'Only a week after Ukrainian sea drones made history by successfully taking down Russian helicopters, another historical first as our homegrown naval drones are now launching their own FPV drones, destroying Russia’s air defense units,' CSCIS said on social media.

After being brought closer to their targets using the USV, the FPV drones were launched against two Russian Pantsir-S1 systems and one Osa system. All three SHORADS vehicles were located in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region. The Pantsir-S1 (known in the West as the SA-22 Greyhound) — which you can read more about here — is one of Russia’s latest SHORADS, while the Osa (SA-8 Gecko) is a Cold War-era system, also used by Ukraine. Both are based on a wheeled high-mobility chassis. A Russian Pantsir-S1 SHORADS vehicle during rehearsals of the Victory Day parade on Red Square in Moscow, Russia. Photo by Sasha Mordovets/Getty Images Sasha Mordovets According to The Kyiv Independent, a single Pantsir-S1 system has a price tag of around $15 million. Back in December, the first evidence emerged that Ukraine was using a capability like this, with aerial drones being launched from USVs as part of its campaign of attacks on Russian offshore platforms. Yesterday’s strikes appear to be the first time that targets on land have been engaged in this way. It’s also noteworthy that Ukraine last week used Magura V5 drone boats armed with repurposed R-73 heat-seeking air-to-air missiles to bring down two Russian Mi-8 helicopters and damage another, off the coast of Crimea, an apparently historic engagement that you can read more about here. These developments underscore the importance of drones — especially the numerous FPV types — to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, providing a relatively low-cost and accurate way to compensate for the huge gap in standoff strike weapons and artillery, not to mention manpower when compared to the Russian opposition. In a naval context, the ability of Ukrainian USVs to strike targets on land is a significant one. Previously, drone boats had very limited options for striking targets on land. As well as the kamikaze-type of USVs that have taken a steady toll on Russian shipping, Ukraine has fielded drone boats armed with unguided artillery rockets. However, these have been primarily used to attack targets at sea. Other USVs have been fitted with heavy machine guns. These offer strictly limited range but are also able to engage close-in aerial targets, providing a degree of self-defense. A Ukrainian Sea Baby USV fires a 122mm Grad artillery rocket during testing ashore. SSU/SBU Meanwhile, FPV drones have a maximum range of about a dozen miles, although, in practice, it’s usually much less than that. A limitation of FPV drones is their requirement for continuous line-of-sight communications with their controllers. However, their range can be maximized by avoiding terrain that can interfere with their signal. This is especially relevant in the littoral areas around the Black Sea, with very few line-of-sight obstacles between the drone boat and potential shore targets, maximizing FPV drone range. In some areas, there may also exist the option to use elevated antennas and relays installed on balloons or placed on uncrewed or even crewed aircraft. This would extend the FPV drones’ connectivity much further and provide a more consistent link. You can read all about this in our previous piece here. Another option might be to use a fiber-optic communications link, with the drone spooling out a cable to remain physically connected to its boat mothership, something that has been used in land-based applications in Ukraine. This would completely remove any line-of-sight communications issues between the FPV drone and the boat. The quality of the video in the Pantsir strike points to this possibility. One question surrounds the method of operator control used for the FPV drones. As noted above, most likely, the FPV video and control feed are being routed to the drone boat via line-of-sight datalink or fiber optic cable and then back to a controller via a satellite datalink, although that would introduce a possible issue with latency. Developments with AI infused into lower-end drones could help drastically to solve any connectivity issues. Although this is still very much an emerging technology, it’s one that is likely to soon erupt on the Ukrainian battlefield, should the war grind on. You can read all about this in our special feature here. As well as being used to attack targets that have already been located by other surveillance means, FPV drones are also able to extend the intelligence-gathering capabilities of the drone boats, supplementing the electro-optical and infrared cameras that are already carried. An intact Ukrainian Magura V5 drone boat that was captured by Russia on the shores of the Black Sea. via X Via Twitter The appearance of the FPV-drone-equipped USVs makes sense. So far, Ukrainian USVs have proven to be a serious menace to Russian naval operations in and around the Black Sea. Already, drone boats presented a very real threat to vessels in port, as well as bridges and other coastal infrastructure. Now that threat has been extended further inland, putting Russian troops and equipment that were, until now, relatively safe, potentially in the crosshairs of Ukrainian drones attacking them from their USV springboards in the Black Sea. The threat that Ukrainian USVs pose in the Black Sea has already led to Russia employing varied means of trying to counter them. As well as armed patrols by naval vessels and aircraft, Russia has also experimented with air-launched FPV drones, which are delivered by helicopter before hunting down drone boats, as you can read about here. Because, why not: Special Forces of the Russian Black Sea Fleet training to destroy kamikaze USVs from helicopter using FPV drones. pic.twitter.com/Y34I8jFtP6&mdash; Clash Report (@clashreport) September 30, 2024 Having FPVs prosecute kamikaze attacks from uncrewed platforms at sea also makes good economic sense for Ukraine. After all, some of the more capable drone boats are understood to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars apiece, all of which would be lost in an instant if they ended their missions in a one-way attack, successful or otherwise. With weaponized FPV drones on board, each drone boat can potentially launch multiple attacks at a much lower cost and even return home afterward, provided it evades destruction itself. Indeed, the FPV drones could potentially also be recovered, if they are not expended. It should also be recalled that operating aerial drones from boats is not without precedent, at least when it comes to flying them off crewed warships. In this area, Israel has established a lead, although it’s developed bigger and more sophisticated one-way attack drones that can be launched from containers on the decks of small warships, both for domestic use and for export, and which can be operated with man-in-the-loop guidance. Above all, Ukraine’s claim of the successful use of FPV attack drones launched from USVs provides another example of the rapid development of uncrewed systems and tactics across all domains in the war in Ukraine. Considering the unquestioned success of FPV drones launched from the ground, it’s no surprise that Ukraine is now increasingly exploring their employment from uncrewed surface vessels. In the process, it’s bringing together two novel assets that Ukrainian forces have successfully used against the Russian Armed Forces on multiple occasions in the past.

NATO Boosting Naval Presence And AI Monitoring In Baltics After U...	By the end of the week, nearly a dozen NATO warships will reportedly begin patrolling the Baltic Sea to protect undersea cables in the region from sabotage. In addition, a U.K.-led 10-member consortium of northern European nations called the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) has reactivated an AI-based system to track suspicious ships in these waters. The actions are a response to the suspected deliberate severing on Christmas Day of the Estlink 2 undersea power cable and four undersea communications cables between Finland and Estonia, which you can read more about in our story here. The Christmas Day cable-breaking incidents are the latest in a series of such events in this strategically important region as tensions with Russia have mounted in the wake of its war on Ukraine. Finnish authorities say the Russian-linked Eagle S purposely dragged its anchor across the sea floor to break those cables. The ship was later found to be full of spy equipment. Finnish authorities detained the ship and its crew, which you can see in the following video. About 10 warships from NATO’s Baltic Fleet as well as from individual member nations will be providing a presence to counter potential saboteurs, according to the Finnish Yie news outlet. They are expected to stay on station until April. Meanwhile, the Gulf of Finland, where the undersea cables were allegedly cut, will continue to be patrolled by Finnish and Estonian naval vessels, Yie explained. NATO has a Standing Naval Maritime Group 1 (SNMG1), a fleet of warships prepared to respond to any threat around the clock. While the group primarily operates in the North and Baltic seas, it will be seen more frequently in the Baltic in the future — particularly due to incidents like the recent damage to the EstLink 2 cable, the Estonian EER news outlet reported. 'If the Russians see that we are present there, the likelihood of such sabotage acts immediately decreases, because saboteurs can be caught in the act, and once caught, it's much easier to deal with them,' Arjen Warnaar, the commander of SNMG, told the publication. As we noted after Estlink 2 was cut, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte responded to a request by Finland and Estonia to help protect Estlink 1 by promising the alliance would 'enhance' its presence in the Baltic Sea without offering any details. Spoke w/ @alexstubb about the ongoing Finnish-led investigation into possible sabotage of undersea cables. I expressed my full solidarity and support. #NATO will enhance its military presence in the Baltic Sea.&mdash; Mark Rutte (@SecGenNATO) December 27, 2024 NATO on Tuesday also declined to provide specifics about its naval presence in the region. 'We don’t discuss future operations nor do we discuss specific numbers of ships/assets employed in a given area of operations,' a NATO naval spokesman told The War Zone in response to our questions. 'NATO has options and assets from many Allied nations. The Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SHAPE), in close coordination with Allied Joint Force Command Brunssum, Allied Maritime Command, and the involved nations are coordinating the employment of those options and assets.' The spokesman added that 'we’ve had persistent military presence in the Baltic Sea and that is something that will continue in full support of our Baltic allies. We will continue to work with our allies to determine options and assets to maintain an enduring military presence.' In addition to NATO's beefed-up naval presence in the Baltics, JEF last week activated Nordic Warden, 'an advanced UK-led reaction system to track potential threats to undersea infrastructure and monitor the Russian shadow fleet, following reported damage to a major undersea cable in the Baltic Sea,' the U.K. Defense Ministry (MoD) said on Monday. The system was set up to protect critical undersea infrastructure and 'harnesses AI to assess data from a range of sources, including the Automatic Identification System (AIS) ships use to broadcast their position, to calculate the risk posed by each vessel entering areas of interest,' according to the MoD. 'The JEF action reinforces existing and planned NATO responses.' Specific vessels identified as being part of Russia’s shadow fleet of oil tankers 'have been registered into the system so they can be closely monitored when approaching key areas of interest,' the MoD noted. 'If a potential risk is assessed, the system will monitor the suspicious vessel in real-time and immediately send out a warning, which will be shared with JEF participant nations as well as NATO Allies.' JEF is currently monitoring 22 areas of interest – 'including parts of the English Channel, North Sea, Kattegat, and Baltic Sea' from its operational headquarters in Northwood, the MoD explained. The system involves ships, aircraft, and personnel from JEF participant nations operating from the North Atlantic Ocean to the Baltic Sea. The U.K.-led Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) monitors 22 areas for suspicious activities, including parts of the English Channel and the North and Baltic seas. (Google Earth) The Nordic Warden system had an initial test run last summer and again in the fall during JEF’s Exercise Joint Protector, which saw more than 300 UK personnel deploy to Latvia to demonstrate the ability of the U.K. to deploy its operational headquarters for JEF abroad at short notice. 'Harnessing the power of AI, this UK-led system is a major innovation which allows us the unprecedented ability to monitor large areas of the sea with a comparatively small number of resources, helping us stay secure at home and strong abroad,' U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey stated on Monday. Royal Danish Navy Absalon-class frigate HDMS Esbern Snare taking part in a JEF exercise. (JEF) In addition to Nordic Warden, the Gulf of Finland has had a ship reporting system in place, known as GOFREP, for the past 15 years, according to EER. 'Under this system, every ship entering the Gulf must report its destination and their movements are closely monitored. If a vessel deviates from its route, it may be stopped,' according to the publication. 'Surveillance of the Gulf of Finland is so thorough that even if a ship switches off all its identification systems, it will still appear on radar. Authorities pay special attention to ships that attempt to navigate ‘blind’ without transmitting identification signals.' The Estlink incident is one of many involving suspected Russian and Chinese attacks on undersea infrastructure. Last week, the Chinese-owned vessel Shunxin-39 was suspected of severing an undersea cable off the Taiwanese coast, according to authorities on the island. Taiwan’s coast guard requested that the cargo ship return to shore for an investigation, but it eventually continued its passage. Taiwan's coast guard said the Chinese-owned Shunxin-39 severed an undersea telecom cable last week. (Twitter) In November, Germany said damage to two communication cables running under the Baltic Sea was most likely the result of sabotage. The two cables in question are both fiber-optic communication cables, running along the Baltic seabed. One of these runs between the Swedish island of Gotland and Lithuania, and the other between Finland and Germany. Gotland is about 280 miles southwest of where the Estlink 2 cable was severed. A day later, Denmark confirmed it was monitoring a Chinese cargo vessel at the center of allegations surrounding that damage. The 735-foot-long Yi Peng 3 was identified as operating near the cables when the incidents occurred. The Chinese vessel had departed the Russian port of Ust-Luga, in the Leningrad region, close to the Estonian border, on Nov. 15 and had been scheduled to sail to Port Said, Egypt, where it was originally due to arrive on Dec. 3. Based on publicly available ship-tracking data, the Yi Peng 3 appears to have passed overhead both of the cables around the same time incidents of damage were first reported. The Chinese bulk carrier Yi Peng 3 was anchored and monitored by a Danish naval patrol vessel (unseen) in the sea of Kattegat, near the City og Granaa in Jutland, Denmark, on November 20, 2024. (Photo by Mikkel Berg Pedersen / Ritzau Scanpix / AFP) / Denmark OUT MIKKEL BERG PEDERSEN Other suspicious activities have taken place in the Baltic Sea, including suspected sabotage. The most notorious of these was a series of explosions along the Nord Stream gas pipelines in 2022. The cause of these is still being investigated by German authorities, however, The Wall Street Journal reported in August that it was a Ukrainian sabotage operation. Ukrainian officials denied that accusation. Outside of the Baltic, there have been other incidents of reported sabotage of critical communications cables, including one associated with Evenes Air Station, in northern Norway, which happened in April but was only disclosed in August, as TWZ reported at the time. Norway has encountered other suspicious incidents, notably the cutting of a vital undersea cable connecting Svalbard to mainland Norway in 2022. As NATO nations react to the cable cut, Finland continues its investigation into Eagle S, a 750-foot-long, Cook Island-flagged tanker carrying Russian oil. The ship’s anchor was found next to drag marks near where Estlink 2 was severed, according to the Yie news outlet. The Swedish Navy's HMS Belos lifted the anchor from the seabed. The Swedish Navy ship HMS Belos found the anchor of the Eagle S, a Russian-linked oil tanker suspected of severing Estlink 2 four undersea telecom cables. (Finnish Navy) 'A drag mark several tens of kilometers long has been found following the anchor,' the general director of the investigation, Chief Inspector of Criminal Investigations Risto Lohi, said in a statement. 'The anchor was found on the route taken by the Eagle S, near Porkkalanniemi.' Tomi (@TallbarFIN) January 7, 2025 Fixing Estlink 2 is likely to take several months. On Monday, Finnish officials announced that two of the four telecom cables that had been cut were repaired. Investigators suspect an oil tanker named Eagle S of the sabotage, accusing the vessel of transporting Russian oil products that are embargoed over Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The Moscow Times (@MoscowTimes) January 6, 2025 The status of additional NATO naval presence in the Baltics to protect the region’s undersea infrastructure should come into clearer focus next week. 'I would suspect NATO and national responses to such destabilizing actions will be discussed during next week’s Allied Chiefs of Defence Meeting with Partners in Brussels,' SHAPE spokesman Army Col. Martin L. O’Donnell told The War Zone on Tuesday. 'After all, the first session will see Gen. [Christopher G.] Cavoli [Supreme Allied Commander Europe] brief the Chiefs of Defense on NATO’s readiness to deter and defend the Euro-Atlantic area and to safeguard the region’s one billion inhabitants.'

Hints At More B61 Nuclear Bomb Variants In The U.S. Military’s Fu...	More new versions of the B61 nuclear bomb could be on the horizon for the U.S. military. This is in addition to the planned B61-13 announced in 2023 and might include a true successor to the highly specialized deep-penetration B61-11 variant. The U.S. Air Force's Nuclear Weapon Center (AFNWC) included explicit mention of potential 'future variants' separate from the B61-12, the production of which is now complete, and the previously announced B61-13 in a recent contracting notice. The B61 series is currently one of the oldest family of nuclear weapons still in operational U.S. inventory. 'The United States Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC) is seeking to expand its sustainment and support services for the B61 nuclear gravity bomb, currently provided via the B61-12 Tail Kit Assembly (TKA) Surveillance and Sustainment Support (BTS3) [contract],' the notice explains. 'Specifically, AFNWC contemplates a contract modification &#8230; to incorporate the B61-13 and any future variants and/or modifications.' The B61-12's most substantial difference from previous versions of the B61 is the addition of the TKA, which includes an inertial navigation system (INS) guidance package. However, not all aircraft set to be capable of employing the B61-12 will be able to use it in its guided mode, as you can read more about here. A picture of a test B61-12 loaded onto an F-15E Strike Eagle with the TKA highlighted. DOD Otherwise, the B61-12s feature a variety of other improvements, the details of which are largely classified, in addition to reusing refurbishing components from earlier B61 variants they are set to replace. The 12-foot-long and 825-pound bombs notoriously cost more than their weight in gold. The B61-13 will leverage the B61-12 design, including the TKA, but with a higher yield, something we will come back to later on. 'The B61-13 and future variants will require highly specialized engineering and logistics services to ensure their continued safety, security, and reliability,' the AFNWC's recent contracting notice adds. 'The AFNWC requires contract support that can adapt to the evolving requirements of the B61 program, and which can ensure the successful sustainment of the B61-13 and future variants.' Though the Air Force's contracting notice does not elaborate on what additional variants of the B61 there might be interest in, it does highlight long-standing questions about the fate of the B61-11 and plans for a true successor. The B61-11, which entered service in 1997, is significantly different in form and function from other variants with a substantially reinforced outer shell, possibly with a depleted uranium penetrating nose section, and a rocket booster at the rear to help it penetrate down to underground facilities. There are reportedly less than 100 of these bombs in the stockpile. Wonder how the B61-12 will perform as an earth penetrating weapon? The B61-11 has add features (see photos) to enhance performance in that role. The B61-12 appears to lack these. E.g. Tail Flare & enhanced stronger casing. pic.twitter.com/fzB6dMEHtx&mdash; Casillic (@Casillic) August 27, 2018 It had been suggested in the past that the B61-12 might be able to supplant the B61-11, as well as the much more powerful megaton class B83-1, since the new bomb could be employed much more precisely. The ability to better focus the new bomb's blast against deeply buried targets would make up for its lack of specialized penetrating capability and lower maximum yield. The B61-12 is a so-called 'dial-a-yield' nuclear weapon with multiple yield settings, the highest of which is said to be 50 kilotons. Sources differ on the maximum yield of the B61-11, but it is said to either be between 340 and 360 kilotons (identical to that of the B61-7) or be closer to 400 kilotons. By 2018, the U.S. government had clearly abandoned this position, with the B61-12 said to be in line to replace B61-3, -4, -7, and -10 variants only at that time. In 2023, the U.S. military announced plans for the B61-13, which is expected to have a maximum yield in line with the existing B61-7, explicitly to replace a portion of those older bombs and 'provide the President with additional options against certain harder and large-area military targets.' 'There is currently no life-extension program for the B61-11. The plan might be to allow it to age out,' Hans Kristensen and Matt Korda at the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) think tank in Washington, D.C., wrote after the announcement of plans for the B61-13. 'Officials say the B61-13 plan does not preclude that the United States potentially decides in the future to field a new nuclear earth-penetrator to replace the B61-11. But there is no decision on this yet.' One specific potential target, Russia's Kosvinsky Kamen bunker, is understood to have been a key driver behind the B61-11's development. The Kosvinsky Kamen facility is situated underneath a mountain and is part of the Russian nuclear command and control enterprise. It could also serve as a so-called 'continuity of government' site to protect senior leadership from a nuclear strike or in response to some other major emergency. Russia has at least one other bunker complex under a mountain, as well as other deeply buried sites used for nuclear command and control and other purposes. China, the U.S. military's current chief competitor and 'pacing threat,' has also been expanding its own array of subterranean facilities, including the construction of vast fields of new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) silos in recent years. Details about the state of new IBCM silo fields in northern China as assessed by the U.S. military per an annual report released in December 2024. DOD Smaller countries like North Korea and Iran have also been increasingly turning to deeply buried facilities, in many cases in direct response to concerns about potential conventional strikes by the U.S. military and others. As noted, the U.S. military has explicitly said the planned B61-13 is intended to help offer additional capacity to strike hardened targets underground, as well as larger ones on the surface. However, it is still not expected anywhere near the same kind of specialized capability found on the B61-11. It is also worth noting that it's not entirely clear how the tail-mounted guidance package found on the B61-12 and -13 could be blended together with the rocket booster at the rear of the B61-11, and a true successor to the latter bomb might have a substantially different overall design. The U.S. military could also have an interest in pursuing other future B61 variants offering different capabilities, including ones focused on employment with lower yield settings. The U.S. Navy has already fielded Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missiles with a dedicated lower-yield W76-2 warhead. Advocates say this offers valuable additional flexibility for managing escalation in any future nuclear scenario, but critics have questioned the real utility of such weapons, as you can read more about here. Personnel at the Pantex plant in Texas load a Mk 4A reentry vehicle containing a W76-1 warhead into a container for transport. The W76-2 warhead fits inside the same reentry vehicle. NNSA New 'guidance requires that all plans for responding to limited nuclear attack or significant, high-consequence non-nuclear attack that has strategic-level effect [must] include an associated concept for favorably managing escalation, including reducing the likelihood of a large-scale nuclear attack against the United States or its allies and partners,' according to an unclassified report on the current Nuclear Employment Strategy of the United States that the Pentagon released last November. 'This escalation management is increasingly important as the operating environment becomes more complex and creates the possibility of pathways for conflict escalation that may not be well understood or easy to predict.' The Pentagon's Defense Science Board (DSB) also announced last November that it had initiated a new study into the 'Nuclear Survivability of the Joint Force.' Russia's threats of the use of nuclear weapons around the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, as well as North Korea's nuclear program and Iranian developments were cited as key drivers. 'In the event of an adversary's use of a nuclear weapon, particularly if the weapon is used against a U.S. ally, the U.S. military may be called upon to respond and contribute to the defeat of an adversary,' according to an unclassified DSB memo about the new nuclear operations study. 'Alternatively, the United States may already be embroiled in a conventional conflict that escalates to nuclear use, putting the warfighter at risk.' 'Continuing to operate after an adversary uses a nuclear weapon will present challenges for the Department of Defense (DoD), beginning with the survivability of U.S. forces, including both personnel and equipment,' the DSB memo added. 'As the DoD undertakes several efforts to modernize and/or acquire new nuclear and non-nuclear capabilities, and as the DoD plans and exercises for major contingencies against nuclear-armed adversaries, consideration must be given to the full range of nuclear survivability options.' Other capabilities increasingly found on modern conventional bombs, such as range-extending wing kits, might find their way onto future versions of the B61, too. It remains to be seen how the already long-serving B61 family may further evolve in response to these and other operational and geopolitical realities. The recent Air Force contracting notice is the latest hint that more versions, including a real replacement for the B61-11, could be coming down the line.

Tailless Fighter-Like Airframe Appears At Chinese Jet Manufacture...	China's aviation industry closed out 2024 with the stunning debut of two previously unseen stealthy combat jets. The country's two preeminent fighter manufacturers, the Chengdu Aircraft Corporation and the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation, are understood to each be responsible for one of them. Now, a recent satellite image shows what looks to be yet another next-generation fighter-like airframe or mockup at Shenyang's main plant in the city of the same name. Planet Labs snapped the satellite image in question on January 1. It shows the object, which is roughly 50 feet (or 15 meters) long and has a slightly wider wingspan, on a small ramp just off the main taxiway at the northern end of the Shenyang plant co-located airfield. It has a modified diamond-like delta platform with a broad central fuselage, which appears to feature two top-mounted engine nacelles. No tail is visible in the image. A slender, pointed nose emanates from the main fuselage area. The exhausts appear to have a wedge-like contour to their trailing edge. No landing gear is visible in the shadow, but that does not mean it isn't there based on the resolution of the image and the angle of the light. PHOTO © 2024 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION The object has a yellow or tan coloring, and China does use a distinctive yellow primer for prototype military aircraft. More recent imagery available from Planet does not provide sufficient detail to offer any more insights into the object or show whether or not it has moved since then. The intriguing object seen at Shenyang on January 1 could be another concept for a next-generation manned tactical combat jet, one in the medium weight class compared to the heavier designs we have seen so recently, or an uncrewed combat air vehicle (UCAV). Crewed or uncrewed, it could also be a demonstrator or just a mockup, or something else completely. It could also be used as a decoy to throw off foreign intelligence. We really can't tell from what is available to us now. Regardless, the object has a distinctly different overall shape than the Flanker variants and derivatives that constitute the bulk of Shenyang's current production output or the members of its stealthy FC-31/J-35 family. It is also unlike the advanced tailless design attributed to the company that emerged last month. A composite image showing different views of the advanced combat jet attributed to Shenyang that broke cover in December. Chinese Internet via X There are some similarities, but also clear differences between what has now been seen at Shenyang and another airframe/test article/mockup that appeared in satellite imagery of the airfield adjacent to Chengdu's main plant back in 2021. It also recalls what looked to be mockups or even full-scale decoys that emerged at China's remote Lintao Air Base the following year, though those had their own distinct shape, including forward canards and extremely slender noses.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION The still unidentified 'shapes' seen at Lintao Air Base in 2022. PHOTO © 2022 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION There are also some very broad similarities in certain respects between what has emerged at Shenyang and concept art of Lockheed Martin's X-44 MANTA (Multi-Axis No-Tail Aircraft) from the late 1990s and early 2000s. The MANTA design was derived from the F-22 Raptor stealth fighter and, at least to our knowledge, never came to be. Artists conceptions of the X-44 MANTA. Lockheed Martin/NASA Separate satellite imagery has also now emerged showing what looks to be a large black-colored mockup on the 'deck' of China's full-size land-based aircraft carrier test facility in Wuhan. Mockups of a Shenyang J-15 carrier-based Flanker variant and a J-35 are also visible. It isn't clear what this shape is supposed to represent, but we have seen mockups of upcoming carrier-based aircraft show up at this unique facility in the past. Probably way too hasty, but doesn't this look like a new fighter mock-up on the 004 (?) mock-up in Wuhan?And it was also visible on the image taken in November. pic.twitter.com/xeZpEsaL8g&mdash; @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) January 7, 2025 As is clear, curious aerospace-related objects have appeared at Chinese facilities in the past, even before the emergence of the two new stealth combat jet designs last month. Those aircraft already reflected years now of steadily more advanced crewed and uncrewed military aviation developments in China, as well as a broader modernization push across the People's Liberation Army (PLA) as a whole. It would make good sense that Shenyang and Chengdu, as well as other Chinese state-run aircraft companies, are working on other advanced designs, including in the classified realm, or have even worked on and moved on from concepts that still have yet to be officially disclosed, if they ever are. Following the December reveals, eyes are still very much on China to see if anything else emerges. So, while the exact nature of what we've now seen in the satellite image of Shenyang remains unclear, its appearance there now is certainly of note.

Our Best Look So Far Inside Israeli’s Once Secretive 707 Tankers	The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have provided an even better look at the previously secretive remote vision system that is central to the operation of the Israeli Air Force’s critical Boeing 707 tanker fleet. TWZ has previously looked at this system — used by the boom operator to see what is happening at the rear of the aircraft while connecting the boom with the receiving aircraft — but the actual operator interface has, as far as we know, never been seen in such detail. View this post on Instagram A post shared by צה&#034;ל - צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) The new imagery comes from an official IDF video that features the 707 tanker — known locally by the Hebrew name Re’em, meaning oryx — and which was published to coincide with its 60th anniversary. The footage shows details including the fuel tanks in the cargo hold and the boom. The internal tanks can also be removed, allowing the aircraft to be reconfigured as transports, including with airliner-style passenger seating. Most interesting, though, is the boom operator’s position, with the remote vision system, or RVS interface. Fuel tanks in the cargo hold of an Israeli 707 tanker. IDF screencap This includes control sticks on either side and a foot-operated communications system, meaning the boomer’s hands are kept free to operate the console. The boomer’s screen is relatively large and surrounded by what appear to be exclusively analog instruments — a reflection of the overall age of the installation. We got a previous view of the screen of the remote vision system back in September 2024, in a video showing portions of a long-range strike mission flown against Houthi targets in Yemen. You can read that earlier analysis here. A view of the Re’em’s RVS provided by the IDF in a video released in September 2024. IDF screencap In July of the same year, after the 707 supported another long-range IAF raid on Yemen, the IDF released video from the RVS camera feed itself, although not of the actual boomer interface that controls the system. Overall, the console used on the Israeli 707 makes a fascinating comparison with the much more modern iteration of the same technology that’s now used on the U.S. Air Force’s KC-46 Pegasus. Of course, the specific technology used in the KC-46 has gained something close to notoriety, since the complex Remote Vision System (RVS) has proven to be a particular source of problems for that program. Cameras for the Israeli RVS in the tail of the 707 tanker. IDF screencap As we can see in the IDF video, as in the KC-46, the Israeli 707 boom operator goes about their work from a station in the main cabin, aided by an array of cameras at the rear of the aircraft that feeds into the RVS. A key difference in the KC-46 is the use of a hybrid 2D/3D system, requiring the operators to wear special glasses, whereas the 707 RVS has just a single monitor. Boom operators sit at their workstations wearing their specialized glasses in the main cabin of a KC-46A. U.S. Air Force As we discussed in our previous coverage of the Israeli RVS, it’s nothing short of surprising that this earlier concept has been serving for decades in a very high-stakes role, while the U.S. Air Force still waits for a revised system in the KC-46: 'Perhaps the most surprising facet of this is that Israel developed and fielded a remote vision system that seems to function without any lingering difficulties, and did so many years ago, while the U.S. version used in the KC-46 is still mired in delays. We still don’t know exactly how bad the teething of this older Israeli system was when it was introduced many years ago. Another modern remote vision system has meanwhile also been developed and introduced by Airbus, on the A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT).' An Israeli Air Force 707 assigned to 120 Squadron, from Nevatim Air Base, Israel, takes off for a mission during Red Flag-Nellis 23-2 at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, March 20, 2023. U.S. Air Force Whatever the story of the Israeli RVS, its days in service now appear to be numbered — ironically, the 707 will be superseded by the KC-46. An initial eight of these aircraft have been ordered and they are almost certain to be provided with the next-generation RVS installed — the 2.0 version of the system is expected to be delivered starting in April 2026. While Israel might decide to continue operating the 707s for a while, to supplement the KC-46, these are, by now, aging platforms, and the most worn-out examples are already being retired. A rendering of an Israeli KC-46 refueling an F-15 fighter. Boeing As for the IAF 707 Re’em fleet, this began to enter service in 1979, with then-newer 707-300 airframes replacing the previous 707-100s. These aircraft were bought from commercial airlines before being modified locally for aerial refueling. The conversion was done by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI). Additional airframes were acquired and upgraded to tankers as recently as the 2010s. In addition to vital aerial refueling, which is fundamental for allowing the Israeli Air Force to conduct long-range strikes, the 707 also has an important role as a command-and-control station and communications node. The aircraft carries a satellite communications suite to provide critical, secure beyond-line-of-sight comms with appropriately equipped tactical aircraft like the F-15 and F-16 and command centers far away. This is also highly important for long-range strike operations. An Israeli Air Force Boeing 707 tanker demonstrates refueling hookups with F-15 fighters over Hatzerim Air Base. JACK GUEZ/AFP via Getty Images Today, Israel is understood to have no more than seven 707 tankers in service, meaning that these assets are more precious to the service than ever. As Israel moves toward phasing out these enduring aircraft, we may well start to learn more about its operations and some of its more sensitive technologies, like the RVS, that have helped it remain the backbone of the Israeli Air Force’s long-range strike capabilities since the early 1980s.

Ukraine Launches New Offensive In Russia’s Kursk Region	As Ukrainian forces mount a new offensive in Russia’s Kursk region, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday said that success in this region would improve Kyiv’s bargaining position in any future ceasefire negotiations. This new effort takes place as Donald Trump is set to return to the White House in two weeks, giving both sides an increasing sense of urgency to gain ground ahead of any future bargaining the new administration might undertake. Ukraine's renewed effort in Kursk also comes as Russia, which claimed it captured a key village in eastern Ukraine, continues to gain ground there. '&#8230;the Ukrainians themselves are trying to make sure that they have that strong hand,' Blinken told reporters in Seoul, South Korea on Monday. 'Their position in Kursk is an important one, because certainly it’s something that would factor into any negotiation that may come about in the coming year.' His assessment mirrors what Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said back in September about Kursk being a 'bargaining chip.' WATCH!!! Blinken says Ukraine position in Kursk 'important' for negotiations'Their position in Kursk is an important one because certainly it’s something that would factor in any negotiation that may come about in the coming year,' Blinken told reporters in Seoul. Alex Raufoglu (@ralakbar) January 6, 2025 Ukraine first invaded Kursk in August but after initial success there, lost about half the territory it gained. It is unclear how much ground Ukraine has gained in the new Kursk offensive. Initial indications were that Ukraine’s surprise attack achieved some early success. However, the Russian Defense Ministry and Russian Telegram channels suggest that Ukraine’s advances have been blunted. The War Zone cannot independently verify these battlefield claims. The new Ukrainian offensive has pushed out in at least three directions, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) stated in its latest assessment. Kyiv's forces have pushed east and southeast of Sudzha, its main base of operations in Kursk, while the also advancing northwest toward the town of Korenevo. Ukrainian forces 'made tactical advances on January 5,' ISW noted. 'Russian sources claimed that Ukrainian forces conducted multiple roughly company-sized mechanized assaults in the Berdin-Novosotnitsky direction (northeast of Sudzha) in three waves of attack using roughly a battalion's worth of armored vehicles. Russian sources claimed that Ukrainian forces also intensified offensive operations in the direction of Leonidovo (southeast of Korenevo) and conducted a reinforced platoon-sized mechanized assault near Pushkarnoye (east of Sudzha).' Geolocated footage published on January 5 indicated that Ukrainian forces 'advanced in fields southwest and south of Berdin and entered the southern part of the settlement,' ISW maintained.

Russian forces, however, also gained some ground in a counterattack, ISW posited. 'Russian forces also advanced southeast of Sudzha and counterattacked against intensified Ukrainian attacks southeast of Korenevo and north of Sudzha on January 5,' ISW stated. 'Geolocated footage published on January 5 shows that Russian forces advanced in western and southern Makhnovka (just southeast of Sudzha).'

'To break through, the Ukrainian Armed Forces covered the area with powerful electronic warfare systems, making it difficult for our UAVs to operate,' Operation Z suggested. 'It is expected that the Ukrainian Armed Forces may attack in other areas as well.' 'The enemy uses IMRs, clears roads and drives in armored fighting vehicles and infantry fighting vehicles,' the Two Majors Telegram channel claimed. 'Widespread Russian concern over Russia's ability to respond to improved Ukrainian EW technology and long-range strike capabilities indicates that Russian forces may be struggling to quickly adapt to Ukrainian battlefield innovations,' ISW reported. 'Reports that Ukrainian forces are using long-range fires to interdict Russian rear areas and EW to degrade Russian drones in support of Ukrainian mechanized advances indicate that Ukrainian forces operating in Kursk are employing more effective combined arms tactics.' A number of Russian channels say that Ukraine has began an offensive operation from near Sudzha towards Bolshoye Soldatskoye in Kursk oblast with armored vehicles. They say Ukrainian EW has been effective against their UAVs and that Ukrainian units cleared mines overnight.… pic.twitter.com/jfllbH9kpj&mdash; Rob Lee (@RALee85) January 5, 2025 In his evening address on Monday, Zelensky claimed Russia has taken heavy losses in Kursk. 'Today marks exactly five months since the start of our actions in the Kursk region, and we continue to maintain a buffer zone on Russian territory, actively destroying Russian military potential there,' he said. 'Since the beginning of the Kursk operation, the enemy has already lost over 38,000 troops in this area alone, including approximately 15,000 irrecoverable losses. The Russians have deployed their strong units to the Kursk region. Soldiers from North Korea are involved there. What’s important is that the occupier cannot currently redirect all this force to other directions, in particular the Donetsk, Sumy, Kharkiv, or Zaporizhzhia regions.' Meanwhile, the Russian MoD claimed it had halted the Ukrainian advances. 'The attempt of the Ukrainian Armed Forces to break through was thwarted by the decisive actions of the Sever Group of Forces' units supported by aviation and artillery,' the MoD stated on Telegram Monday. 'As a result of the fire damage, the enemy's main forces were neutralized on the outskirts of Berdin area.' As we have previously reported, Russia’s defense of Kursk has been aided by the influx of about 12,000 North Korean troops. So far, nearly a third of those troops have been killed or wounded, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told American podcaster Lex Fridman in a wide-ranging interview that aired Saturday. 'North Korea sent 12 thousand of its soldiers, 3800 are already wounded or dead,' Zelenskyy tells Fridman in his interview But he also issues a warning, watch pic.twitter.com/7bcLojFkEW&mdash; Euromaidan Press (@EuromaidanPress) January 6, 2025 On Monday, Blinken doubled down on the Biden administration’s assertions that there is a quid pro quo between Moscow and Pyongyang taking place, an arrangement we have written about in the past. 'What we’re seeing is not only the provision of artillery, ammunition, and troops by North Korea to Russia – forced aggression against Ukraine – but we are seeing collaboration, support coming in the other direction,' Blinken avowed. 'Russia is already providing military equipment to the DPRK. It’s providing training. We believe that it has the intent to share space and satellite technology with the DPRK, and that concern is very much a focus that not only the United States but also the Republic of Korea and Japan are bringing to bear – and very much part of our conversations.' Ukraine’s new Kursk push comes as Russia claims it captured the tactically important eastern Ukrainian town of Kurakhove in the Donetsk region. Sitting astride the N-15 highway, the settlement is just south of a mile-wide stretch of the Vovcha River and supports the movement of troops and materiel in the region. As such, it is a bulwark on a Russian advance toward Pokrovsk about 20 miles to the north. Ukraine’s military command in the east did not comment on the Russian claim that Kurakhove had fallen. However, 'soldiers fighting in the area, and a local Ukrainian military official, said when reached by phone that while there were pockets of resistance in the factories on the outskirts, the town was essentially lost,' The New York Times reported. Today, the Russian Defence Ministry said its forces had seized the Ukrainian town of Kurakhove in Donetsk Region after several months of heavy fighting there. pic.twitter.com/Ppe3wa5N93&mdash; Will Vernon (@BBCWillVernon) January 6, 2025 The battles in Kursk and Kurakove played out against the backdrop of the looming presidency of Donald Trump, who has promised to quickly end the war. Though the president-elect has yet to provide any specifics, Zelensky said he is confident Trump can deliver on that pledge. 'I now see that when I talk about something with Donald Trump, whether we meet in person or we just have a call, all the European leaders always ask, how was it?' Zelensky said during his three-hour podcast interview with Fridman. 'This shows the influence of Donald Trump, and this has never happened before with an American President, I tell you, from my experience, this also gives you confidence, you know, that he can stop this war.'

You can read more about that in our deep dive here. Russia is not amenable to that, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov explained last month. 'Judging from numerous leaks and Donald Trump’s interview with Time magazine on December 12, their idea is to suspend hostilities along the line of contact and transfer responsibility for confrontation with Russia to the Europeans,' Lavrov told the Russian official TASS news outlet. 'We are not happy, of course, with the proposals made by members of the Trump team to postpone Ukraine’s admission to NATO for 20 years and to station British and European peacekeeping forces in Ukraine.' We will learn more in the coming days about the success of Zelensky's latest Kursk gambit and whether any increased deployment of troops and equipment there further weakens his forces' defense of the east. Beginning Jan. 20, when Trump is inaugurated, both sides will learn more about what he will do to try and end this full-on war, nearing its third anniversary.

Taiwan Coast Guard Blames Chinese-Owned Ship For Cutting Undersea...	A Chinese-owned vessel is suspected of having severed an undersea cable off the Taiwanese coast recently, according to authorities on the island. Taiwan’s coast guard requested that the cargo ship return to shore for an investigation, but it eventually continued its passage. Last Friday’s incident is the latest to have affected Taiwanese cables and is part of a pattern of similar events that have also occurred recently around Europe. The international fiber-optic telecom cable was cut early Friday morning, around 7:51 a.m., near Taiwan’s Keelung Harbor. The Trans-Pacific Express cable belongs to the Taiwanese government-run Chunghwa Telecom, which connects East Asia with the U.S. West Coast. According to Chunghwa, communication could be rerouted via other cables, with services experiencing minimal disruption. In what might be a #China grey zone warfare tactic against #Taiwan a Cameroonian registered freighter with a Chinese name SHUNXIN39 cut a Chunghwa Telecom undersea cable off Taiwan’s north coast on Saturday. This is the 21st time Chinese ships have cut Taiwanese undersea cables pic.twitter.com/yaAuec4f5v&mdash; Special Taiwan (@TaiwanSpecial) January 6, 2025 The cable in question is one of around a dozen connecting Taiwan to other countries in the region and Chunghwa says the break was caused by a vessel snagging it and dragging it across the seabed. At the center of the incident is the Shunxin-39, a Cameroon-flagged cargo ship that Taiwanese authorities say is owned by Jie Yang Trading Limited, a Hong Kong company headed by Guo Wenjie, a citizen of China. Taiwanese authorities say that seven of the crew members on board were Chinese nationals.

Vessels being registered in more than one location is not unheard of in international shipping, where the precise owners of a given ship are also frequently hard to determine. According to Col. Ray Powell, director of SeaLight, an initiative at Stanford University that tracks China’s pressure tactics aimed at Taiwan, the Shunxin-39 had actually used as many as six different AIS numbers over the past six months, and at least two different names. Ship that damaged #Taiwan's submarine cable seems to have operated under at least 2 names (Shunxing39 & Xingshun39), 2 flags (Camaroon & Tanzania) & 6 Maritime Mobile Service Identities (MMSI) between Keelung & Puson over the past 6 months. (Hat tip: @Byron_Wan) pic.twitter.com/4jvqVMTBc8&mdash; Ray Powell (@GordianKnotRay) January 6, 2025 Multiple reports indicate that Taiwanese authorities believe that the vessel was involved in the incident, whether deliberate or otherwise. Combined with the multiple identities, suspicions have been raised by the fact that the vessel was sailing back and forth in waters near Taiwan in the past two weeks, according to one Taiwanese security official. 'While its intentions remain unclear, the possibility of a Chinese provisional vessel conducting gray zone harassment couldn’t be ruled out,' the Taiwanese Coast Guard said. The cargo ship was intercepted by the Taiwanese Coast Guard around eight miles off the north coast of Taiwan late on Friday, after a nine-hour mission to track it down. According to Facebook page Taiwan ADIS, Coast Guard Administration intercepted a Tanzania-registered container ship with Chinese name XINGSHUN39 (MMSI 677087200) — but apparently all media in Taiwan reported it as Cameroon-registered SHUNXIN39 — after it was suspected of… pic.twitter.com/LUJnxy2CHJ&mdash; Byron Wan (@Byron_Wan) January 4, 2025 Although it was ordered to move closer to shore for an investigation, rough weather prevented any member of the Coast Guard from boarding the vessel. Instead, the Shunxin-39 was able to continue en route to the port of Busan in South Korea. The Taiwanese Coast Guard says it has notified the corresponding South Korean maritime agency about the case. Although they were not able to investigate the vessel, Taiwanese authorities say they have collected radar data and navigation records that will be provided to prosecutors for further investigation. As to the suspicion of potential deliberate sabotage by the Shunxin-39, the deputy head of Taiwan’s digital ministry, Herming Chiueh, told The Wall Street Journal that the cable-cutting was likely intentional. 'You need to accidentally [drop your] anchor on the cable, and then you need to accidentally turn on your engine with the anchor down, and even [if] you realize your anchor is down, you need to keep the engine moving until you cut the cable,' Chiueh said. Chiueh added that he recently met with European counterparts to discuss the vulnerability of undersea cables. He said that there was a growing consensus that vessels suspected of sabotage needed to be stopped and searched immediately because once it is 'sailing back to China, you can’t do anything.' Whether deliberate or not, the incident last Friday was the latest in a series that has affected Taiwanese undersea cables. In February 2023, for example, two undersea internet cables running between Taiwan and the island of Dongyin, part of the Matsu Islands, and roughly 30 miles off the coast of China, were severed by a Chinese fishing boat and a cargo vessel, according to Taiwan authorities. The island was left without internet access for weeks. Fishermen on a jetty at a harbor on Beigan Island in the Matsu archipelago.

In a recent incident of possible sabotage in the Baltic, on December 25, 2024, an undersea power cable between Finland and Estonia was severed, with suspicion falling on one of Russia’s so-called shadow fleet of oil tankers. After being seized by Finnish Police, the ship in question, the Eagle S, was found to be 'kitted out with special transmitting and receiving devices that were used to monitor naval activity, according to a source with direct involvement in the ship,' Lloyd’s List reported. A month before that, Denmark confirmed it was monitoring a Chinese cargo vessel at the center of allegations surrounding damage to two communication cables in the Baltic Sea.

Photo by MIKKEL BERG PEDERSEN/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images In another prominent incident, back in October 2023, a Hong Kong-registered containership, the Newnew Polar Bear, was accused of damaging the Balticconnector natural-gas pipeline and data cables by dragging its anchor along the seabed in the Gulf of Finland. Also in this incident, the suspect ship rapidly left the area, headed toward Russia, without authorities having investigated it. Incidents like these have highlighted the vulnerability of critical undersea infrastructure to sabotage, especially as part of so-called 'gray zone' tactics or a hybrid warfare campaign of the kind that NATO officials have repeatedly warned that Russia is currently embarking upon. For Taiwan, the concerns are very much the same, although China is the antagonist. Taiwan already faces regular large-scale Chinese military maneuvers directed at it, including practice blockades of the island as well as exercises featuring so-called 'precision strikes.' This is in addition to less-obvious tactics designed to undermine Taiwanese self-rule and democratic institutions. A PLA Navy Type 072A (Yuting II) class landing ship sails toward a zone in which China said it would conduct live-fire exercises northeast of Pingtan Island, the closest point in China to Taiwan, in China’s southeast Fujian province on April 10, 2023. Photo by GREG BAKER/AFP via Getty Images Any Chinese military move on Taiwan — which Beijing views as a rogue province that is fully within its sovereign territory — would very likely be preceded by efforts to knock out undersea communications infrastructure, strangling the data flow to and from the from island. Only last month, the Taiwanese military ran a war game based on potential Chinese aggression, in which one of the scenarios involved a communications blackout caused by the severing of undersea cables. Meanwhile, the importance of having more robust communications is something that Taiwanese officials have been concerned with for some time now. So far, it has been far from easy to attribute cable-cutting incidents to any particular culprit, be it Russia, China, or another actor altogether, but there seems little doubt that these kinds of activities are on the increase. With the Shunxin-39 having escaped investigation on this occasion, it seems unlikely that the cable cutting off the Taiwanese coast will ever be traced definitively back to Beijing. On the other hand, the incident is a stark reminder of the vulnerability of this kind of critical infrastructure. For Taiwan, in particular, it will also be seen as another example of China’s willingness to employ a wide range of tactics, many of them unorthodox, to try and undermine the island’s independence.

Murder Hornet Nickname For F/A-18s Equipped With Nine Air-To-Air ...	The U.S. Navy is now officially using 'Murder Hornet' to refer to F/A-18E/F fighters armed with five AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) and four AIM-9X Sidewinders. The air-to-air ordnance configuration for the Super Hornet made its combat debut last year in operations over and around the Red Sea and was enabled by a crash program to allow F/A-18E/Fs to carry more AIM-9Xs, which TWZ was first to report on. The Murder Hornet configuration and its use in combat were among various highlights the office of the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) included in a recently released year-in-review factsheet for 2024. The formal unveiling of the AIM-174B air-launched version of the Standard Missile-6 (SM-6), the first combat employment of an AGM-88E Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile (AARGM), and the service's first air-to-air engagement of a hostile drone were also included. TWZ was also the first to report on the AGM-88E shot, which destroyed an Mi-24 Hind attack helicopter on the ground in Yemen. An F/A-18E with the Murder Hornet loadout launches from the flight deck of the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower in the Red Sea on April 19, 2024. USN As already noted, the new air-to-air loadout for the F/A-18E/F required the Navy to first clear the jets to carry AIM-9Xs on their outboard underwing stations (stations 2 and 10). Previously, the service's Super Hornets could only carry the latest generation Sidewinders on their wingtips. The Navy did this in response to urgent operational demands to give the jets more magazine depth to help tackle kamikaze drones launched by Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen. F/A-18E/Fs with the Muder Hornet loadout were first observed conducting operations in the Red Sea region while flying from the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower in the April-May 2024 timeframe. Those aircraft were also seen carrying AN/ASQ-228 Advanced Targeting Forward-Looking Infrared (ATFLIR) targeting pods and centerline 480-gallon fuel tanks. The configuration has since been observed on Super Hornets assigned to other carriers operating in the Middle East. A Murder Hornet assigned to the air wing aboard the supercarrier USS Theodore Roosevelt lands at Muwaffaq Salti Air Base in Jordan in August 2024. USAF As TWZ has noted in the past, while Super Hornets could carry an additional AIM-120 in place of the ATFLIR pod: 'Advanced targeting pods are critical components of a modern tactical fighter’s air defense arsenal as they allow for beyond-visual-range positive identification of targets. This is especially important in densely populated and complex airspace, and can lead to quicker identification friend or foe and the ability to fire on a target with confidence long before it would be within the rules of engagement otherwise. ATFLIR’s infrared and TV sensors can be slaved to the Super Hornet’s radar and vice-versa, adding an extra layer of integrated targeting.' 'The pods can also collect important intelligence on aerial targets, whether they are engaged or not. A secondary quasi-infrared search and track mode is also available on some pods that can provide detection of stealthy targets, although this is not nearly as capable as a dedicated advanced IRST sensor system.' The ATFLIR pods are especially important for visually identifying enemy aerial targets at night. The nine-missile Murder Hornet configuration does leave two additional underwing pylons empty. At the same time, not having stores on those stations, especially additional draggy drop tanks, would help the jets retain decent dash speed and maneuverability. Without additional tanks, the Super Hornet range and time on station would also be reduced, which could make the configuration particularly well suited to area air and fleet defense missions closer to carrier strike groups. It's also worth noting that the centerline drop tanks on Murder Hornets could be substituted for one incorporating an infrared search and track (IRST) system, but also less fuel, in the future. The IRSTs are set to give Super Hornets a substantially improved ability to spot and track aircraft and other aerial targets, especially stealthy ones, at extended ranges, as you can read more about in this past TWZ feature. The Super Hornet's manufacturer Boeing has touted a heavy air-to-air loadout of 12 AIM-120s and two AIM-9Xs in the past, but it is unclear if Navy jets are authorized to fly in that configuration. Older Legacy Hornets can also carry up to 10 AMRAAMs and two Sidewinders.

Boeing A Legacy Hornet with a 12-missile air-to-air loadout. USN The term 'Murder Hornet' was also used colloquially to refer to another even heavier air-to-air loadout seen last year on an F/A-18F assigned to Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Nine (VX-9) during Exercise Gray Flag 2024. The VX-9 jet carried four AIM-174Bs, as well as three AIM-120s and a pair of AIM-9Xs. Babe wake up, more Murder Hornet pic.twitter.com/nljWCEUc7P&mdash; Doha (@Doha104p3) November 5, 2024 There have been nicknames for other ordnance configurations on other aircraft in the past, too, including the 'Beast Mode' loadouts Lockheed Martin has touted for certain variants of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. 'Murder Hornet' had previously entered the American lexicon more broadly following the appearance of Asian giant hornets in the United States in 2019. U.S. authorities declared those real and invasive hornets had been eradicated in the country in December. Navy Super Hornets continue to be a very active part of U.S. military operations in and around the Red Sea against the Houthis. More than a year on now, the Yemeni militants continue to launch kamikaze drone and other attacks on commercial vessels and foreign warships in the region, as well as against targets in Israel. Drone kill marks seen on an F/A-18E Super Hornet from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower's air wing last year. USN/The War Zone Giving tactical combat jets greater magazine depth is becoming increasingly important, in general, especially given the ever-growing threats posed by various tiers of drones across domains. The U.S. Air Force's new F-15EX Eagle II is a prime example of this trend. Air Force F-15E Strike Eagles, which can also carry a large amount of ordnance, notably found themselves quickly running out of missiles while shooting down Iranian drones headed for Israel in April 2024, as you can read more about here. Altogether, unlike the Asian giant hornet population in the United States, Navy Murder Hornets look set to continue making appearances, in the Red Sea, the Middle East, and potentially elsewhere.

Red Sea Attacks Are Testing Combat Information Centers Aboard U.S...	The Combat Information Center (CIC) is the nerve center and tactical brain of a U.S. Navy surface combatant. These high-tech floating command centers and their watchstanders have been put to the test over the last year unlike any other time in history, as missile and drone barrages from Houthi rebels in Yemen have plagued the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. With this in mind, TWZ spoke with multiple surface warfare officers (SWOs) about the realities sailors face when fighting their ship from within the CIC, including what factors come into play, what mistakes can arise during tense, time sensitive engagements and the effects of being on patrol in a free-fire zone for months on end. Cocooned within the ship, amongst the dimly lit CIC packed with glowing screens, are between 10 and 20 sailors on watch at any given time. Led by a tactical action officer (TAO), they track all threats and movements in the region around the ship. A CIC’s air warfare watchstanders might flag an inbound Houthi missile and approve firing orders to other ship combat systems, while others are scanning the rest of the sky, correlating electronic warfare signals, tracking other surface vessels and watching out for submarines. CICs also keep in constant communication with other Navy vessels and aircraft in the area via various datalink systems, sharing sensor data and coordinating actions. The CIC works closely with the bridge to best move the ship to its most survivable or advantageous position at any given time as well. The combat information center (CIC) aboard a modernized U.S. Navy cruiser. (U.S. Navy) 'The things that make the environment really busy are just trying to manage threats, trying to manage traffic, trying to manage the general environment,' Bradley Martin, a retired surface warfare officer who spent two-thirds of his career at sea, told TWZ. 'It’s designed to handle a lot of information and handle processing and display and dissemination. But like anywhere, when a lot of things are going on, it takes a lot of concentration to keep things straight.' Despite the slew of information being passed back and forth in the CIC, particularly in a cruiser serving as the air defense commander for a carrier strike group, the CIC — referred to as 'combat' in the surface fleet — would appear calm to an outsider who walked into the space, according to a retired Navy cruiser captain who spoke with TWZ on condition of anonymity to share his assessment. But the seeming tranquility of sailors on computers or talking into headsets belies the stakes of the CIC's work. 'You have external comms coming from the aircraft carrier, from the planes,' he said. 'You have someone in combat typically talking to the planes themselves, checking in and checking out. You've got internal communications, everybody's got a headset on, they've typically got one circuit in one ear and another circuit in the other.' But these days, CIC watchstanders have been tested in unprecedented ways every day in the Red Sea over the past year, these SWOs tell TWZ. Sailors assigned to the Navy destroyer USS Carney (DDG-64) at work inside the ship's combat information center in July 2024. (U.S. Navy) 'As the amount of aircraft and the threat of actually taking a hit increases, then the pucker factor and the intensity increases as well,' the retired captain said. The Red Sea fight has required endless vigilance and honed attention from CICs the entire time their ship is operating in those waters, according to an active-duty SWO who requested anonymity to share his personal thoughts. 'You run that kind of high-stress scenario from the moment you enter the theater until you leave if you’re operating in the Red Sea,' the active-duty SWO told TWZ. 'Every other test since Operation Iraqi Freedom has been a test of our ability to support strikes into other places. This is the first time we've had a sustained conventional threat against open water shipping.' Since October 2023, Navy destroyers have been shooting down aerial drones and missiles, as well as sinking drone boats, launched by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, sometimes at a near-daily clip. You can read about the Houthi's arsenal being brought to bear against shipping around the Bab-el-Madeb Strait here. But even as CICs track, identify and at times engage with a variety of objects popping up on their sensors, system breakdowns and inexperienced sailors hinder effective CIC operations even in peaceful waters, raising the stakes of the current Red Sea mission — and the consequences of mistakes. As an investigation into how the Navy cruiser USS Gettysburg (CG-64) came to shoot down a F/A-18 Super Hornet jet over the Red Sea last month continues, the cruiser’s CIC was likely tracking a bevy of airborne objects simultaneously. TWZ previously reported that the shootdown occurred during a sustained Houthi drone and missile attack targeting the USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75) carrier strike group. Cruisers serve as the air defense headquarters within such strike groups. A view of flight operations aboard the USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75) on December 18, 2024. (U.S. Navy) With regard to the Gettysburg friendly-fire incident, Martin said they were dealing with a situation where there were a lot of aircraft in the sky, along with surface threats, all of which created 'a complicated air defense environment.' 'Whether or not somebody might have made a serious mistake with the Gettysburg, we don’t know what set of systems or decisions [were made], or what might have happened,' Martin said. 'They’re busy and dealing with some ambiguous situations, situations unlike what the Navy has dealt with in a long time.' The SWOs who spoke with TWZ said that Navy CICs in the Red Sea deserve credit for executing so well. 'These ships over the last year have done a fairly remarkable number of engagements, far more than the Navy had done in the previous 50 years,' Martin said. 'And they are by and large handling those correctly.' Still, the active-duty SWO said the Houthi aerial drone threat adds a major layer of complexity for the CICs to manage. 'When a missile gets fired, I know what that is, it's coming out of Yemen, moving at this speed, blast it out of the sky,' he said. 'All these drones just act like airplanes, and the problem is airplanes can be good or bad, and it's hard to tell the difference.' 'I don't envy their position,' the active-duty SWO said of CIC teams in the Red Sea. 'It sounds miserable. It's not black and white, and you have a bunch of gray zone contacts.' 'It's pretty damn complicated, and it requires a very high level of cognitive attention to detail, and alertness,' the retired cruiser captain noted. Adding to the Red Sea stress is the fact that the systems upon which a CIC relies regularly go down, according to an active-duty, former destroyer commander who requested anonymity to speak frankly. That’s compounded by the fact that, while a CIC watch team may spend months training up together, some of those sailors will never deploy due to them having to head to a new assignment. 'It’s a miracle if you can train the same team that goes from basic phase to advanced phase to deployment,' the former destroyer skipper said. The guided-missile destroyer USS Gravely (DDG-107) launches Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAM) in January 2024 in the Red Sea. (U.S. Navy) Watching from afar, the former destroyer CO fears that a mix of inexperienced CIC sailors and the kind of regular system outages that plague Navy warships could at any time cause things 'to kind of break down pretty quick' in the Red Sea, despite the winning track record so far. While the Houthis might not be the most advanced threat, 'it does not take much' for a warship’s radar or other systems to crash, he said, leaving the vessel without critical information and vulnerable. The nature of the Houthi fight makes it harder to decipher objects on the radar as well, the officer said. In such instances, the TAO will often do a 'hook and look,' locking onto an airborne object that pops up on radar and then working to identify it. 'If I had hooked an unknown track that was at 10,000 feet going 340 knots in the direction of the carrier, my first thought is that’s an F-18,' and other ship systems would soon confirm that, the former destroyer CO said. But in the Red Sea, an enemy aerial drone may get tracked at the same bearing and range, but perhaps at a lower altitude than the friendly jet, which can sometimes cause watch standers or radar systems to 'swap tracks,' he said. 'So we have people trained to then hook and look and verify and interrogate again,' the former destroyer CO said. 'When you’re doing all of that with a couple of aircraft, that’s hard. If you’re doing it with, like, 15 aircraft, it’s really hard. If you’re doing that with 15 aircraft, missiles and [air drones], it’s very, very hard.' The U.S. Navy destroyer USS Carney (DDG-64) fires a missile to intercept a Houthi barrage in October 2023. (U.S. Navy) CICs also regularly struggle with 'leaders,' or long lines on a radar that look like something speeding at 780 knots toward the ship, only for it to suddenly disappear. And while a warship’s Aegis Combat System is designed to help clear some of that clutter, the former destroyer CO said CIC watch standers risk becoming complacent with leaders. 'Sometimes you’ll drop clutter so routinely that you could end up dropping a missile,' he said. 'There's specific parameters to set the ship to, even in the Red Sea, but you have to go through that process to make sure that your clutter mapping and your systems configuration is accurate to that exact location with the amount of sand that's in the air, deducting for the temperature and the environment and atmosphere and everything else.' 'More tracks and confusion, and then you start throwing in some of those long leaders of clutter, because it’s the Red Sea, full of sand and shit,' the former destroyer CO added. 'You’re like, well, I hope that’s clutter.' Meanwhile, CIC sailors are working to coordinate object assessments with other strike group CICs and the air defense commander, a task made harder by the Red Sea’s busy skies. 'So, track number 1234, is F/A-18 friendly, or track number 1234 is hostile, [aerial drone], cruise missile, whatever that is,' the former destroyer CO explained. 'But if they’re doing that for every one of the inbound threats, then you have a lot of track coordination that’s going on in the background in a very short amount of time. That has to be correct, because they can force order something in the [Link 16 communications] system that will make it that thing, regardless of somebody disagreeing with it or not.' A supporter of Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels fields a diorama of a U.S. warship under a Houthi missile during a demonstration in the capital Sanaa on Dec. 6, 2024. (Mohammed Hamoud/Getty Images) The former destroyer CO said he feels it’s 'lucky' that no Navy ships have been hit so far in the Red Sea, but he suspects 'the American public are going to lose their minds if a destroyer gets hit.' 'At some point, sailors are going to get killed, and I feel like it doesn’t take much,' he said. 'You’ve got a bad interface control, system casualty, fog of war, clutter, or your missile malfunctions, your [Phalanx Close-In Weapons System] wasn’t aligned properly, or something like that.' The Phalanx Close-In Weapons System (CIWS). (U.S. Navy) Despite the efforts of the Navy warships and their CICs in the Red Sea, the former destroyer CO also said he thinks the Houthis’ tactics will improve, as will their weapons, if other nations opt to provide them with better munitions. While Iran has largely supplied the Houthis thus far, reports surfaced last year that Russia was seeking to arm the Houthis with more-advanced cruise missiles. A gunner's mate stands watch on the optical sighting system in the combat information center aboard the Navy destroyer USS Gravely (DDG-107) while transiting the Bab al-Mandeb Strait on Feb. 19, 2024. (U.S. Navy) 'They’re doing everything they possibly can to try and kill Americans,' he said. 'At the end of the day, I think there’s a lot of luck involved in this right now, to be right and perfect 24/7.' When and how the Red Sea battle will end remains to be seen. Until then, the U.S. sailors standing watch in the CICs will continue to deal with a hostile, crowded and frenetic combat environment, with no shortage of objects to track and threats to engage.

New Armor Kits Being Installed On Ukraine’s Western Air Defense S...	A major Ukrainian metal and mining company that makes so-called cope cages for the country’s tanks and fighting vehicles says it has installed a new armor protection system on at least one of Ukraine's operational high-end air defense systems, with plans to produce more. The development comes from lessons learned from the war. First Russia, then Ukraine, began adding caging and additional armor to nearly all their mechanized equipment to provide some level of protection, primarily against drone attacks. Today, Western air defense systems donated to Ukraine are among Russia's highest priority targets, with strikes on them from various types of lower-end drones and more advanced standoff munitions, including time-sensitive attacks using drones for spotting and Iskander ballistic missiles for the strikes. Artillery can also pose a danger for those systems located close to the front. The Metinvest Group on Friday said it has designed a system using nearly 200 armored steel plates, up to 8 mm thick, that are attached to the sides of a Western-donated air defense system’s command module. The total weight of the armor exceeds 2.6 tons 'but does not affect the system’s functionality or mobility,' Metinvest claimed. It is a part of the firm’s broader 'Steel Front' wartime production initiative, which has also been churning out pre-fabricated protected shelters, body armor, and other kinds of materiel for the Ukrainian armed forces. Protective armor panels were installed on a German-donated IRIS-T air defense command module. (Metinvest) The company said the system is designed to protect against shrapnel, without mentioning any specific weapon. Even protection from nearby strikes could be critical to the survivability of air defenders and their vehicles as many of these air defense systems are made up of multiple mobile or semi-mobile components. If one is directly targeted, armor could help save the prized command vehicle and its occupants nearby. The same can be said for some cluster weapon and artillery attacks. 'We developed the project from scratch in a month and a half, and, following the blueprints, manufactured a shield for the crews of the Patriot surface-to-air missile (SAM) system using Metinvest’s Ukrainian armor steel,' said Oleksandr Myronenko, Chief Operating Officer of Metinvest Group and the head of the Group’s dedicated steel production for the needs of the Ukrainian army. 'This shield guarantees protection against fragmentation damage for both the defenders and the air defense control system. Our experienced engineers also supervised the assembly of the armor.' Ukrainian Air Force spokesman Col. Yuri Ignat told us that the protection system was actually installed on a German-made IRIS-T SLM air defense system now deployed in Ukraine. You can see the command module for that system in the video below and the images at the top of this story. The reason for the discrepancy is unclear, but it could very well exist on both types. We have reached out to Metinvest for details.

The IRIS-T SLS is for short-range protection while the IRIS-T SLM is for medium-range. Both fire variants of the IRIS-T missile that was originally designed for air-to-air applications. Germany's Diehl Defense makes the IRIS-T. Ukraine has received six SLMs and five SLSs. The IRIS-T SLM system components. (Diehl Defense) To date, Ukraine has lost several components to Western-donated Patriot, IRIS-T, and National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS) air defense systems according to the Oyrx open-source tracking group. At least two M901 launchers for MIM-104 Patriot systems have been destroyed and an AN/MPQ-53 radar damaged. At least one MAN SX45 8&#215;8 launcher for an IRIS-T SLM system was destroyed and a TRML-4D multi-function radar was damaged while two NASAMS launchers have been destroyed, the group states. The actual figures are very likely to be significantly higher because Oryx only tabulates losses for which it has visual confirmation. Metinvest said it has drawn on its previous experience with armored vehicles to develop the new protection system for the air defense systems. 'The Group has mastered the production of steel screens for the main domestic T-64 and T-72 tanks, American M1 Abrams tanks, Bradley infantry fighting vehicles and is preparing to integrate them into various Leopard 2 modifications,' the company noted. 'To date, more than 300 screens have been delivered to the military.' Back in March, we profiled the company's development of the Abrams caging. From the pictures Metinvest released of the Abrams equipped with the screen, the array was extensive with a main screen on top of the turret and others around the front, sides, and rear. The full configuration looked to have additional angled sections that close the gaps between the top and the side panels. In the image below, you can see very small gaps left open for the Abrams’ side-mounted launchers used to fire smoke grenades to help conceal the tank. It is worth noting that FPV drone operators have been proven very adept at using available gaps, even small ones, in armor screens and other defenses to slip in and make attacks. Ukrainian Abrams tanks are emerging with new factory-standard anti-drone 'cope cage' armor screens and additional explosive reactive armor a month after they were reportedly pulled from the front lines due to drone threats. (Metinvest) Metinvest Another image provided by the company shows an additional screen attached to the rear of the hull. A picture showing the screen around the rear of the hull. This also has the Steel Front initiative logo at the top right. (Metinvest) As Metinvest’s press release at the time made clear, the main purpose of the new and elaborate factory-made cope cage for the Abrams is to help protect these high-value tanks against first-person view kamikaze drones. Highly maneuverable and carrying warheads that detonate on contact, armed uncrewed aerial vehicles of this type have become a near-constant scourge on both sides of the battlefield in Ukraine. FPV types, in particular, are now talked about as being on par with artillery in terms of battlefield significance. Russia has also steadily challenged Ukraine’s initial dominance in this field, as well. One air defense expert we talked to questioned Metinvest's claim that the added weight of the armor on the SAM command module won't affect its mobility. 'Adding 4,600 pounds to any vehicles above the standard load plan is a lot of weight,' David Shank, a retired Army colonel and former commandant of the Army Air Defense Artillery School at Ft. Sill, Oklahoma, told us on Friday. 'I would submit that this weight would hinder the performance of the prime mover which pulls these large trailer systems.' That's an important consideration, Shank added, given that Ukraine frequently moves around its air defense components to address emerging threats. Any added protection for air defense crews will be welcome regardless, especially for the systems that are operating forward, well within the reach of multiple Russian threats. The Latest On the battlefield, Russia continues to chew up territory in the Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions in the eastern part of Ukraine. Here are the key takeaways from the latest Institute for the Study of War (ISW) assessment: Kursk: Ukrainian and Russian forces continued combat engagements in Ukraine's salient in Kursk Oblast on January 1 and 2, but there were no confirmed changes to the frontline. Kharkiv: Russian forces continued offensive operations near Vovchansk (northeast of Kharkiv City) on December 31 through January 2 but did not make any confirmed advances. Luhansk: Russian forces reportedly advanced northwest of Kreminna amid continued offensive operations along the Kupyansk-Svatove-Kreminna line on January 1 and 2. Donetsk: Russian forces recently advanced near Siversk, Toretsk, Pokrovsk, Kurakhove and Vuhledar but did not gain any ground near Chasiv Yar or Velyka Novosilka. Zaphorizhzhia: Russian forces recently advanced in western Zaporizhia Oblast amid continued offensive operations in the area on January 1 to 2. Kherson: Russian forces continued attacks in the Dnipro River area and on the islands in the river delta on December 31 and January 1 to 2. NEW: Ukraine's decision to not renew its contract to transport Russian gas through Ukrainian territory will likely significantly impact Russian gas revenues despite Kremlin posturing to the contrary.

'The Immediate Action on Air Defence (IAAD) project is led by Germany and aims to support Ukraine's air defenses with donations of various air defense systems and to support through joint funding those nations that have chosen to donate air defense systems to Ukraine,' according to the MoD. 'Sweden reported interest in participating in the project during the autumn.' Romania 'is in need of financial resources to re-get projectiles, sensors, and other Patriot-type equipment as a replacement for the systems donated to Ukraine in 2024,' the MoD noted, adding that the funds come from previously announced aid packages to Ukraine. Sweden is providing 300 million Swedish krona as part of the German IAAD initiative, which aims to strengthen Ukraine's air defence.

'I would very much like President Trump’s unpredictability to be directed primarily toward the Russian Federation,' Zelensky said. The Ukrainian leader doubted Trump could live up to his promise of ending the nearly three-year-old war in just one day. However, 'the ‘hot’ stage of the war can end quite quickly if Trump is strong in his position,' Zelensky suggested.

'But I raised an issue, saying we didn’t hear what specific countries will join this initiative, and whether the U.S. will be there,' noted Zelensky, who met with Trump and Macron in Paris last month.

'Kursk is a very strong trump card in all negotiations, especially with countries that are very important to us, particularly those in the Global South,' he said, according to the Ukrainian Ukrinform news outlet. 'I never anticipated it would have such a significant influence, as these nations had been under the sway of 'invincible Russia.'' Zelensky added that Russia's decision to send North Korean military personnel to Kursk was a tactical blunder. 'They [the Russians] took the North Korean contingent. Where did they send it? To that very place [to the Kursk region]. I believe that this is a tactical mistake on their part,' he suggested. As we have previously reported, of about 12,000 North Korean troops sent to Russia, more than 1,000 have been killed or wounded in Kursk, John Kirby, the White House National Security spokesman, told reporters, including from The War Zone.

Ukraine’s State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) is examining the actions of the 155th Mechanized Brigade after accusations of mismanagement and massive desertions were made by Ukrainian journalist Yuri Butusov, according to the Suspline news outlet. 'The investigation is ongoing,' SBI told Suspline on Thursday. 'It is too early to talk about any preliminary results.' On Dec. 31, Butusov, editor of the Ukrainian Censor.net news outlet, wrote a scathing story claiming his investigation found a host of problems with the brigade. Its founding was an 'organizational chaos' from its inception and faced manpower shortages even before leaving for France as 2,500 troops were sent off to other units. That removed many of the most qualified personnel from the brigade. Of the 1,924 soldiers eventually sent to France, only 51 had more than a year of military service, while 1,414 had served for less than two months, Butusov noted. Making matters worse, between March and November, over 1,700 soldiers deserted, Butusov claimed without providing evidence. Though the unit was replenished with new recruits, these often did not undergo 'proper selection process,' the journalist posited. Butusov blamed Ukraine’s leadership, including Zelensky and Command-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Oleksandr Syrsky. 'France fully fulfilled all obligations for arming and training the brigade, which the Ukrainians demanded,' Butusov wrote. 'But during the training stage of the new brigade in France, more than 50 servicemen fled. This raised questions among the French leadership about the seriousness of the Ukrainians' attitude to the implementation of such an expensive project. This approach seriously discredits Zelensky's entire plan, and therefore a scandal began.' The military, meanwhile, blamed the brigade's commander, Dmytro Riumshin for those desertions. He was dismissed in early December alongside several other top officers. The new commanders were unaware of the problems plaguing the unit, adding to the confusion, Butusov wrote. Beyond the desertion problem, the 155th Brigade did not receive drones or electronic warfare equipment from the Ukrainian command, Butusov argued. In addition to poor organization and insufficient training, that is said to have contributed to the losses the unit suffered once deployed in combat in November. 'This is indeed a crime, but the crime is not of soldiers and officers - but of the leaders of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters, the Ministry of Defense, and the General Staff, who continue to waste lives and state funds on new projects, instead of strengthening experienced and combat-ready brigades,' Butusov concluded.

Israel Buys 7.62x51mm Version Of U.S. Army’s New Sig Sauer M250 L...	The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has reportedly acquired a version of the 6.8x51mm M250 light machine gun that Sig Sauer developed for the U.S. Army, but chambered to fire the NATO-standard 7.62x51mm round. Sig Sauer's design may now be in line to supplant at least a portion of Israeli Negev light machine guns, 5.56x45mm and 7.62x51mm variations of which are current in IDF service. Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported yesterday on the IDF's purchase of the 7.62x51mm version of what Sig Sauer currently markets commercially just as its Light Machine Gun (LMG). The outlet cited anonymous sources, as well as a video that emerged last month, seen in the social media post below, which indicates the guns are intended as Negev replacements.

The fourth gun has an EOTech EXPS-series holographic sight, which is also non-magnifying. What looks to be a night vision or compact thermal optic is also visible in the foreground at the beginning of the clip. The guns with the ROMEO8T optics also have aiming lasers mounted on accessory rails on the front left side of the handguard. All four LMGs have suppressors fitted, as well. The U.S. Army is also fielding its M250 versions of the LMG with ROMEO8T optics. The service announced back in 2022 that it had chosen Sig Sauer to supply the core components of its Next Generation Squad Weapons (NGSW) family, which includes the M250 and the M7 rifle, the latter of which also fires the 6.8x51mm round. Per Sig Sauer, there is no difference dimensionally between the 6.8x51mm and 7.62x51mm versions of the LMG, or a third variation chambered for the 6.5mm Creedmoor round. All of them have 16-inch barrels and 37-inch overall lengths with the gun's buttstock in its collapsed position. No empty or loaded weights are provided in the company's publicly available defense catalog, but the U.S. Army says its variant tips the scales at 13 pounds unloaded and 14.5 pounds with a sound suppressor fitted. The page on the Light Machine Gun from Sig Sauer's publically available defense products catalog. Sig Sauer Overall, Sig Sauer's LMG was designed with modularity in mind, as well as with ergonomics intended to mimic those found on AR-15/M16-pattern rifles that U.S. and Israeli military personnel, and many others around the globe, are already familiar with. The IDF's acquisition of at least some 7.62x51mm LMGs does not come as a complete surprise. Sig Sauer notably displayed a placard detailing 'Major Global Contract Wins' at the official opening of its expanded ammunition plant in Jacksonville, Arkansas, in October 2024. Included therein in the 2024 column were depictions of the LMG and the .338 Norma Magnum version of the company's new Medium Machine Gun (MMG), along with the ROMEO8T optic and linked .338 ammunition, all with Israeli flags alongside them.

There is a possibility that the guns seen in the video earlier in this story are part of small batch for test and evaluation. 'Both the [Israeli] Defense Ministry and the IDF declined to comment on' whether the LMG specifically was intended to replace one or both versions of the Negev light machine gun, according to Haaretz. Though very likely to be heavier than the M250 to some degree, the 7.62x51mm LMG could still be significantly lighter than the existing 7.62x51mm Negev NG7 in its standard configuration with a 20-inch long barrel, which has an empty weight of around 17.5 pounds. Israel Weapon Industries (IWI) also offers a short-barrel version of the NG7 that is marginally lighter and an ultra-light derivative that is just 14.5 pounds empty. Despite its smaller caliber, the standard 5.56x45mm version of the Negev is also around 16.5 pounds before any ammunition is loaded. A member of the IDF with a Negev NG7 during operations in the Gaza Strip in November 2023. IDF The NG7, which was unveiled in 2012, already reflected a broader global trend in interest in lighter-weight machine guns chambered in 7.62x51mm and similar calibers. Guns in this broad category offer greater range and terminal performance in a handier package compared to light machine guns chambered to fire smaller rounds. These were key factors that led the U.S. Army to field versions of the 7.62x51mm Mk 48 light machine gun, a scaled-up derivative of the 5.56x45mm M249 Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW) originally developed for the U.S. Navy SEALs, and then the M250. A member of the US Army with a Mk 48 machine gun. US Army For Israel, a 7.62x51mm version of Sig Sauer's LMG also allows for the use of existing ammunition stocks. With the U.S. Army planning to buy thousands of M250s, there is set to be a robust overall supply chain for the company's light machine gun family for decades to come, as well. The IDF more broadly adopting Sig Sauer's LMG, as well as its MMG, would be another major win for the company, which has been making steady inroads in the global small arms market for years now. Acquisition decisions by Israel's armed forces often have trend-setting impacts around the world. It will be interesting to see how widely the IDF fields the new guns from Sig Sauer and how that might impact further purchases in Israel and elsewhere worldwide.

Ukrainian Su-27 Flanker Pilot’s Rare Account Of The Changing Air ...	An inside look at the life of a Ukrainian Su-27 Flanker fighter pilot in the country’s war with Russia is the topic of a recently released video from the Ukrainian Air Force. The interview with the Su-27 pilot with the callsign 'Viking' is a rare opportunity to hear about some of the challenges — and successes — of the Ukrainian Air Force’s fighter fleet, which, despite the recent introduction of F-16s, is still dominated by the Soviet-era Su-27 and MiG-29 Fulcrum. Viking starts the interview with some reflections on the very first days of fighting after Russia launched its full-scale invasion on February 24, 2022. His experiences sound very similar to those of the late MiG-29 pilot 'Juice,' who was interviewed several times by TWZ before his death in a training accident in August 2023. The loss of Juice has also meant that opportunities for these kinds of interviews are now much reduced. Viking was not at his normal base in the Zhytomyr region when the war started, he was in Kyiv. His race to Zhytomyr was frustrated by a lack of rail services out of the capital and ended with a walk of between 25-30 miles to get to the air base, still in civilian clothes. Once there, he was very quickly in the thick of the action, and from February 25 he was flying air defense missions that he described as 'deterrence,' first flown in daylight and later at night, over the Kyiv region. Viking straps into the cockpit of a Ukrainian Su-27. Ukrainian Air Force screencap 'We held them back,' Viking explained. 'If their aircraft had come here and worked freely, everything would have been completely different.' All the time, Viking and his fellow 39th Tactical Aviation Brigade (39 BrTA) pilots faced a significant disadvantage in terms of radars and missiles compared to the Russians. While Ukrainian fighters could occasionally track enemy aircraft, getting within missile-launch range was rarely possible. The Ukrainian Air Force began the war with around 32 Su-27s operational within two brigades, the 39 brTA at Ozerne in the Zhytomyr region of northwestern Ukraine and the 831 brTA at Myrhorod in the Poltava region of central Ukraine. At least 15 of Ukrainian Flankers have been visually confirmed as destroyed but, in the meantime, additional examples have also been returned to airworthiness after overhauls. The aircraft are also regularly moved around between different operating locations, some of them austere in nature, making it harder for the Russians to target them. This Su-27 landed in Romania on the first day of the conflict, for unknown reasons, and was later returned to Ukraine. via X www.twz.com Like many pilots and other Ukrainians at this time, it took some time for Viking to grasp the reality of the war, with the feeling that 'I’ll wake up and everything will be over' characterizing what he described as the difficult period in his life. At the same time, the resilience of Ukrainian non-combatants was also plain for him to see: his girlfriend chose to stay in Zhytomyr, with their cat, rather than leave the country; his parents also stayed at home, his mom sent a photo of a basket of Molotov cocktails will the message that she planned to use at least one on the invaders. 'They were in a fighting mood, and I was also in a fighting mood, but it was hard…' Viking reflected. 'The most difficult thing was misunderstanding. [Due to] the instability of the front, there was a minimum of information.' The view through the head-up display of a Ukrainian Su-27 after a missile is launched. Ukrainian Air Force screencap As an example, in these early days, Viking’s available intelligence on Russian air defenses was scrawled on a piece of map that he’d torn off, with information vital for survival being exchanged by word of mouth between pilots. The map simply showed the best route into a given area, with circles showing the approximate engagement ranges of hostile air defenses. The primary job at this time was attempting to blunt the advance of Russian tactical aircraft flying from Belarus. 'We were the only ones here, to put it bluntly. We were the first line of defense, and they were constantly trying to sneak their Su-34s and Su-35s in at night, at extremely low altitudes.' Viking dons his helmet before a sortie in a Su-27. Ukrainian Air Force screencap Complicating their job was the fact that, according to Viking, the avionics and missiles of the Ukrainian Su-27s, at this time, were 'two generations behind' those of the Russians. Within these parameters, 'the battle was reduced to trying to get closer to [the Russians].' But even if that was possible, the Ukrainian Su-27 pilots were rarely able to get within the launch parameters of their missiles, with the Russian jets always having the opportunity to launch their weapons first. 'Even though our [missile] launches had short ranges, we still tried something, we launched missiles, we held the Russians back, and we repelled these attacks every night,' Viking explains. 'Almost every pilot flew two, sometimes three sorties each night. Russian Su-35S fighters from Dzyomgi Air Base arrive in Belarus in January 2022. ahead of the full-scale invasion. Russian Ministry of Defense Su-35S fighters from Dzyomgi arrive in Belarus, in January 2022. Russian Ministry of Defense One particular sortie that Viking recalls involved a 'very, very difficult' hour-and-a-half air battle at night, during which six missiles were launched against his Su-27: 'four launches from aircraft, two launches from the ground.' Viking’s second flight that night, March 1, 2022, involved a failure of his navigation instruments, in worsening weather, with gathering clouds and fog. He had to be guided by a ground controller to land at Starokostyantyniv Air Base in western Ukraine. 'I lost my spatial orientation,' he says. 'It’s scary, you don’t understand where you are, you don’t understand where you are heading, in what attitude you are in.' Inside the cockpit of a Ukrainian Su-27. Ukrainian Air Force screencap 'Every new day of this war posed new challenges, all our training, all our vision, was based on rather outdated experiences and our weapons were quite outdated.' This was especially the case when going up against more modern Russian air defense systems, some of which work 'at a crazy range' as well as being highly mobile, in the case of the Buk and Tor (SA-11 Gadfly and SA-15 Gauntlet), especially. Russian air defenses made it 'impossible' for the Ukrainian Air Force to drop conventional unguided ordnance, making the arrival of Western-supplied precision-guided weapons an absolutely critical factor. These new weapons allowed the Ukrainian jets to operate 'a little further from the front line,' thanks to the standoff range of the new weapons. Now the Su-27 began to flex from its air-to-air specialism to more offensive strike duties. Viking’s first experience using the AGM-88 High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile, or HARM, resulted in a claimed 90 percent success rate against Russian ground-based defense targets, demonstrating 'the incredible effectiveness' of the weapon. Other milestones included Viking’s first downed drone, a challenging target for a fast-moving relatively low-tech jet, as we have discussed before. Armorers attach an AGM-88 HARM under the wing of a Ukrainian Su-27. Ukrainian Air Force screencap Viking noted that Russian media reports were highly skeptical about how U.S.-supplied weapons would be used on Ukraine’s Soviet-era aircraft, and even if this was possible. Some Russian accounts predicted that the HARMs would more likely be launched from the ground, off the back of adapted trucks, rather than from the air. The innovative approach to integrating Western weapons on Soviet-era fighters eventually involved a combination of new tactics, specially designed pylons that can pass targeting information to the missiles, as well as tablet-based cockpit interfaces. A Ukrainian Su-27 armed with a pair of infrared-guided R-73 air-to-air missiles. Ukrainian Air Force screencap Russian doubts 'played into our hands,' Viking says. 'We destroyed a lot of [air defense] complexes, damaged them, suppressed them, and forced them to retreat. This gave us space to come a little closer [to the front lines].' This, in turn, allowed Ukrainian airstrikes to reach further, bringing critical Russian military targets in Ukraine within range. 'Even the main command post of the Russian Ground Forces was hit,' Viking explains. 'They were, let’s say, punished for their insolence.' Today, the HARM is mainly used as a 'support weapon,' Viking says, meaning that they provide defensive escort for other Ukrainian aircraft, dealing with pop-up Russian air defense threats that might be encountered en route to other objectives. After the HARM, Viking’s brigade began to receive the Joint Direct Attack Munition–Extended Range (JDAM-ER) and the GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bomb (SDB). A Ukrainian Su-27 using the BRU-61/A rack, designed to hold up to four of the 250-pound-class Small Diameter Bombs. Ukrainian Air Force screencap While he considers the 500-pound JDAM-ER to be relatively efficient, even in the face of intense Russian electronic warfare countermeasures, he singles out the SDB for particular praise, confirming that a single Su-27 can carry eight of these bombs.

The purported destruction of a Russian-occupied building by a Small Diameter Bomb strike. Ukrainian Air Force screencap 'Despite the fact that it’s quite small, it’s quite a powerful bomb,' Viking says of the SDB, noting that it can penetrate around six feet of reinforced concrete. The design philosophy behind the SDB is also in stark contrast to Soviet-era aerial bombs, which always prioritized size and weight — 'the main thing for them is that there should be a big explosion, rather than accuracy.' However, more explosive doesn’t necessarily translate to greater destructive power, as the SDB has shown. The difference in approach is also seen in Russian tactics. Viking says the Russians frequently use at least ten times as many munitions in one single area of the front lines than Ukraine does across the entirety of the front lines in a month. Viking suggests that, while Ukrainian munitions might achieve an accuracy of as high as 85 percent, Russian equivalents might only attain 15-20 percent on target, hence the need for more and heavier weapons to compensate. Viking also warns again about the particular threat posed by Russia’s relatively recently developed low-cost precision-guided glide bombs — a menace that has frustrated Ukrainian air defenses since they first began to appear in early 2023. The first known photo of the Russian UMPK glide bomb kit, based on a FAB-500M-62 bomb, carried by a Su-34, and published in January 2023. Fighterbomber Telegram channel 'To treat the symptom, it’s necessary to drive away the carriers of these glide bombs, but this is a difficult task, and it requires a complex approach. Unfortunately, there is no magic wand to drive them away. It needs a complex approach, including both the aviation component and the ground component, as well as the necessary air defense radars, and air-to-air missiles that have the ability to hit, at least at medium altitudes, targets at a range of 100 kilometers [62 miles],' Viking says, referring to the need for beyond-visual-range missiles to target the aircraft launching the the glide bombs. 'Without all these means, if the Russians continue to throw glide bombs, then the consequences will be terrible, they will simply squeeze us out, no matter how incredible our infantry is.' The Russian glide bomb problem became one of the main arguments for accelerating Ukrainian F-16 deliveries, although it remains to be seen how effective these might be in pushing back the Russian jets launching glide bombs from across the border. Ukrainian F-16s were presented during a Ukrainian Air Force Day event attended by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky on August 4, 2024. Photo by Ukrainian Presidency/Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu As the war approaches its three-year anniversary, Viking reflects that, while physically tired, his morale remains as high as ever. 'The war requires 100 percent of your effort,' he says. 'Even when you go on leave for 15 days, you come back and you don’t quite understand why already everything has changed: we are working in a new way, in new areas, the enemy has come up with a countermeasure, and we have come up with some kind of countermeasure ourselves.' Viking adds a morale-boosting slogan to a Small Diameter Bomb under the wing of a Su-27. Ukrainian Air Force screencap Despite limited F-16 deliveries so far and continued losses to the Soviet-era fleet of tactical jets, Viking says that there is no shortage of trained manpower or aircraft at this point. Instead, what the Ukrainian Air Force lacks is air-launched weapons. Only greater numbers of these, he says, will be able to achieve some kind of parity with Russian airpower capabilities.

Inside Israel’s Commando Raid On Iran’s Underground Missile Facto...	The Israeli Ministry of Defense has released details — and imagery — of a dramatic commando raid into Syria, which targeted an underground missile production facility, back in September. The raid, codenamed Operation Many Ways, was deemed an outstanding success, with the facility destroyed and none of the 120 Israeli special forces troops involved being injured. Until now, however, very few details of how the raid took place had emerged. The raid was carried out on September 8 by members of the Israeli Air Force (IAF), specifically its elite Shaldag unit and Unit 669. Shaldag is a clandestine outfit that specializes in long-range penetration operations, including commando-style raids. Unit 669 is tasked primarily with combat search and rescue (CSAR), a key requirement of missions carried out in or close to hostile territory. The target of Operation Many Ways was, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) say, an Iranian-run missile manufacturing site, codenamed Deep Layer by the Israeli military, part of the Scientific Studies and Research Center (SSRC) network. A satellite image of the Deep Layer facility. IDF What the Israeli Ministry of Defense described as 'precision-guided missiles' and long-range rockets were planned to be made here and then supplied to Hezbollah in Lebanon as well as to the Assad regime in Syria. In terms of Iranian support for Hezbollah, Deep Layer was Iran’s 'flagship project,' according to the IDF. The IDF says the target was surveilled with 'extensive intelligence gathering and monitoring' and a plan for its destruction reportedly started to take shape 'months' ahead of the operation. Fascinating, apparently the Masyaf site was an underground facility for producing and casting solid propellant rocket motors. First such site I have seen, apart from some more primitive Hamas ones. pic.twitter.com/X62kY5rmMs&mdash; Fabian Hinz (@fab_hinz) January 2, 2025 Fitting its name, Deep Layer was located deep underground, buried within a mountain in the Masyaf area of Syria, west of Hama. Reportedly situated between 230 and 430 feet below the ground, the facility was considered more or less impregnable by IAF airstrikes. But destroying it using a commando raid was also a huge challenge since its location was more than 124 miles north of the Israeli border, and around 28 miles from Syria’s western coastline. IAF personnel oversee the raid from a command center in Israel. IDF As to the layout of the facility, the IDF says it was horseshoe-shaped, with an entrance in the side of the mountain where raw materials went in, and an exit nearby from where the completed missiles emerged. There was also a third entrance used for logistics and to reach offices inside the facility. Along the horseshoe were at least 16 rooms where missile and rocket motor assembly took place. A rendering of the underground tunnel network. IDF At the time of the raid, the facility was not yet working at full capacity, construction work having begun here in late 2017. However, according to the IDF, at least two missiles had been successfully manufactured as part of testing, and rocket engines were already being mass-produced. Ultimately, it was expected that the facility would be able to produce between 100 and 300 missiles of various kinds annually. A satellite image of the facility, with details of the buildings overlaid using computer-generated imagery, in a graphic released by the IDF. IDF The soldiers involved in the operation, 100 members of Shaldag and another 20 members of Unit 669, were transported into and out of Syria aboard four CH-53D helicopters, locally named Yasur. Official pictures that have now been released, like the one below, show that military working dogs were also part of the force. Reconnaissance and fire support were provided by undisclosed Israeli fighter jets, as well as vessels of the Israeli Navy. IAF personnel disembark from a CH-53 after the raid. IDF According to the Israeli media, the CH-53s were escorted by a pair of AH-64 attack helicopters, while other air assets included 21 fighters, 14 reconnaissance aircraft, and five drones, among others. Meanwhile, 30 more aircraft were on standby in Israel to respond if the operation began to go wrong. 'The six helicopters flew over the Mediterranean Sea far off the coast of Lebanon, before crossing into Syria above its own coastline,' The Times of Israel reports. 'The choppers flew unusually low in order to evade Syrian radars and air defense systems.' IAF personnel discuss the raid after returning to Israel. IDF The Syrian air defense systems around the facility were, the IDF determined, the second-most densely concentrated in Syria, surpassed only by Damascus, although at least some had already been knocked out by IAF airstrikes and had not been repaired or replaced. Reportedly, it took the helicopters only 18 minutes to reach the facility after they had crossed the Syrian coastline, and none were detected. Concurrent with their arrival, IAF fighters and drones along with missile-armed Israeli Navy vessels hit targets both related to the facility and elsewhere in Syria. The strikes on other targets were intended to serve as a deception, to mask the objective of the commando raid, were it to be detected. Although the helicopters were apparently not detected by local air defenses, Israeli reports indicate that 'dozens' of Syrian soldiers began to head to the facility, suggesting that they must have been alerted to the operation, although perhaps only after the commandos had landed. To hamper any Syrian response, strikes also targeted roads in and out of the facility. The first of the CH-53s put troops down very close to the entrance to the facility and once all four had dropped off the troops the helicopters moved to landing zones nearby and waited for the mission to be completed. The Unit 669 members remained on the aircraft, waiting for the call to action if any of the commandos were injured. The view out of the rear ramp of one of the CH-53s involved in the raid. IDF The operation is said to have involved the first team of commandos securing the area while a second team advanced toward the entrance, killing two guards. Meanwhile, another team took up a position on a nearby hill, from where they operated a small drone. This drone was reportedly equipped not only for surveillance, but was also armed, so it could 'eliminate anyone approaching the facility.' Within an hour, the first team of commandos had broken through one of the entrances, which were protected by heavy doors. Further internal doors were opened using nearby forklifts. Indeed, at least some of the commandos underwent forklift driver training, for just this eventuality. This mission was forklift-certified pic.twitter.com/CiuAA56fbt&mdash; ELINT News (@ELINTNews) January 2, 2025 As well as forklifts on site, the commandos used a quad bike they had brought with them to move explosives around the tunnels. In all, 50 commandoes were involved in planting explosive devices, while the other 50 waited outside to provide surveillance and offer covering fire. Meanwhile, IAF fighters continued to hit targets, dropping 49 munitions in total during the raid, although not all were around the facility. IAF commandos in one of the tunnels at the facility during. the raid. IDF After around 660 pounds of explosives had been rigged up, a remote detonator was planted at the site entrance, and the 100 commandos moved to the original landing site, where the same helicopters picked them up. As they boarded, the explosives were triggered. In all, the IDF assesses that its soldiers killed 30 guards and Syrian soldiers during the operation, while Syrian media reported 14 dead and 43 wounded. According to the IDF, the operation was completed with the commandos involved having spent a little over 2.5 hours on the ground in Syria. Members of the IAF leadership discuss the outcome of the raid with some of the commandos involved. IDF 'During the operation, the forces reached critical machinery for manufacturing precision missiles, including a planetary mixer, numerous weapons, and intelligence documents, which were transferred for investigation,' the IDF disclosed. 'The soldiers destroyed the compound and safely returned to Israeli territory.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu commented on the operation in Syria: 'I salute our heroic fighters for the daring and successful operation deep in Syria. This was one of the most important preventive operations that we have taken against the efforts of the Iranian axis to arm itself in order to attack us; it attests to our boldness and determination to take action everywhere to defend ourselves.' IAF commandoes after their return to Israel from the Syria raid last September. IDF Israel destroyed a secretive missile production facility in northwest Syria in September 2024, in an attack that included inserting special operations forces by helicopter to retrieve equipment and documents. IDF IDF Operation Many Ways took place when Syria was still ruled by Bashar al-Assad and before Israel launched its campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon. After the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria, it seems that Israel has decided that it can publicize details of the commando raid. This will also serve as a warning of potential further operations directed against Iran and its proxies in the region. The fact that the operation demonstrated Israeli willingness and capacity to launch such raids against deeply buried and highly defended bunkers sent a signal to Iran, which is a key takeaway we highlighted when the first mention of the special operations raid emerged. While executing a similar operation against an underground target in Iran would be far more complex and risky, this has always been a real possibility and Israel has proven itself more than capable of operating within Iran's borders. More recently, Prime Minister Netanyahu has spoken of a changing order in the region, with two of Iran’s key proxies there, Hamas and Hezbollah, deeply degraded and the Assad regime eliminated, stating: 'After Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Assad regime in Syria, the Houthis are almost the last remaining arm of Iran’s axis of evil. The Houthis are learning, and will learn the hard way, that those who strike Israel will pay a very heavy price for it.'

Photo by Ma'yan Toaf / Israel GPO / Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu While disclosing details of Operation Many Ways, the IDF said it will 'continue to act strategically and professionally with various methods and tactics to remove threats directed at the citizens of Israel.' This clearly includes special operations raids against very hardened underground facilities well beyond Israel's borders.

U.S. Reportedly Setting Up New Base In Northern Syria	A half dozen years after abandoning Kobani, U.S. forces are reportedly building a base in this northern Syrian city on the Turkish border that has been riven by strife between the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and Turkish-backed forces. This all comes as a new Syrian government is trying to establish control over the country after ousting Bashar al-Assad. Several videos and images have emerged on social media claiming to show U.S. troops and equipment heading toward Kobani, reportedly to build a new international coalition base. The U.S. has a presence of about 2,000 troops in Syria, ostensibly deployed to continue the ongoing fight against ISIS. That fight apparently came to the U.S. on Wednesday, when a man claiming an ISIS affiliation carried out a deadly attack in New Orleans.

'SOHR activists have reported seeing the convoy on Al-Hasakah-Al-Raqqah highway, while it was heading to Ain Al-Arab area (Kobani) in the eastern countryside of Aleppo. The convoy was accompanied by a military vehicle of SDF. According to SOHR sources, this comes as a part of US forces’ efforts to boost their bases and establish a new military base in Ain Al-Arab in light of the growing security and military tension in that region.' The international coalition forces 'brought a convoy of logistic reinforcements including premade chambers, surveillance cameras, cement blocks, fuel tanks and digging machinery towards Kobani,' SOHR added. '&#8230;the digging and drilling will start tomorrow and more military reinforcements such as soldiers, weapons, armored vehicles, radars, and anti-aircraft weapons will be brought.'

We will update this story with any information provided. After pulling out of the Kobani area, the U.S. military announced that a pair of U.S. Air Force F-15E Strike Eagles had struck the defunct Lafarge Cement Factory in northern Syria, on Oct 16, 2019. This facility sits along the highly strategic M4 highway between the cities of Ain Issa and Kobani, and had served as the 'headquarters of the de facto Defeat-ISIS coalition in Syria,' U.S. Army Col. Myles Caggins, the chief spokesperson for the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS in Syria and Iraq, said on Oct. 15, 2019. The base was used extensively to support special operations and included landing pads for multiple helicopters. It is unclear if this is the facility the U.S. is reportedly trying to build up now. After the U.S. departed the facility, Russian forces took it over and remained there until pulling most of its troops out of Syria in the wake of the Assad ouster. You can see that site in a satellite image obtained by The War Zone at the time. The former U.S. base at the defunct Lafarge Cement Factory in northern Syria as of Oct. 22, 2019.

At the core of the issue is Turkey’s long-standing contention that SDF is functionally indistinguishable from the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK. Both the United States and Turkey have designated the PKK, which has operated in Turkey, northern Syria, and northern Iraq, as a terrorist group. However, the U.S. government insists that PKK and SDF are separate organizations. The claimed U.S. build-up in Kobani comes as fighting continues between the SDF and Turkish-backed forces continues in northern Syria.

Kurdish journalist Rohat Baran emphasized that these sites are not just vital for the local population but also hold broader regional importance in terms of trade, energy, and military operations. The Qara Quzak Bridge is a pivotal location along the M4 international trade route, a corridor connecting key areas such as Kobani, Raqqa and Manbij, Baran noted. 'This route is essential for logistics, commerce, and defense in northern Syria,' he reported. 'The Tishreen Dam, meanwhile, supplies electricity to vast parts of northern Syria, including Aleppo, Deir ez-Zor, and al-Hasakah. Losing control of these sites could have catastrophic consequences for the region’s infrastructure and security.' 'The defense of Tishreen and Qara Quzaq is not merely local but encompasses the security of Kobani, Raqqa, and the broader&#8230;region,' Baran continued. Turkish strikes escalate over strategic northern Syria sites Turkey’s strikes on Tishreen (Tişrîn) Dam and Qara Quzak (Qere Qozaq) Bridge intensify.

'Secretary Austin emphasized that close and continuous coordination is crucial to maintaining the ongoing success of the D-ISIS mission. The Secretary and Minister Güler also discussed the importance of setting the conditions to enable a more secure and stable Syria.' Meanwhile, Syria's new leadership is working to solidify its hold on the country since overthrowing Assad nearly a month ago and says it wants to include SDF in that effort. The head of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the former al-Qaida-linked group that staged the coup against Assad and now runs the country, met with the SDF on Tuesday for the first time since the overthrow. The results of the discussions between SDF and Ahmed al-Sharaa, now the de-facto leader of Syria, were 'positive,' the BBC noted. Al-Sharaa, also known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, confirmed that the transitional administration is in talks with the SDF to resolve the crisis in northeastern Syria, with the aim of eventually integrating the SDF into the national armed forces, the Al Arabiya news outlet reported. He reaffirmed that Kurds are an integral part of Syria’s fabric, ruling out any plans for partition. 'There will be no division of Syria in any way,' al-Sharaa told the publication in an interview. 'Negotiations are ongoing with the SDF to resolve the crisis in northeastern Syria,' al-Sharaa explained, adding that the new government would not allow Syria to become a launching pad for PKK attacks.

If the past is prologue, this may be a short-lived move after Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. As we reported at the time, Trump shocked SDF by announcing a withdrawal of U.S. forces from Kobani in 2019. Trump had already stated his intention to eventually pull out all U.S. forces from Syria in December 2018. Despite Trump's wishes, the U.S. kept troops in Syria throughout his first administration. In 2021, White House Coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa Brett McGurk noted in the following tweet that Russian troops took over the Kobani facility after the U.S. withdrawal. As the anti-Assad rebels were advancing across Syria, Trump offered some insight into how he might approach the presence of U.S. troops there in his new administration. 'Syria is a mess, but is not our friend, & THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT,' he exclaimed. 'LET IT PLAY OUT. DO NOT GET INVOLVED!' As for the potentially ISIS-related attack in New Orleans, a truck driven by Army veteran Shamsud-Din Jabbar allegedly drove into a crowd, killing at least 15 people. Investigators later found an ISIS flag in that truck. During a press briefing on Thursday, deputy assistant director of the FBI's counterintelligence division Christopher Raia said Jabbar stated in a post on Facebook that he had joined ISIS last summer, CBS News reported. Shortly before the attack, 'He posted several videos to an online platform proclaiming his support for ISIS,' Raia said. He added that at this point, there was no definitive link between the New Orleans attack and the detonation of a Tesla Cybertruck full of fireworks and other explosive material outside the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas hours later, an event that is being considered a possible act of terrorism. There is no way to know at the moment how this attack will affect Trump's calculus on how many troops should remain in Syria, where they will deploy, or if he will keep the new base in Kobani, if need it is established. Regardless, America's battle against ISIS continues.

Ukraine’s Su-25s Seen Launching Hammer Rocket-Boosted Bombs For T...	For the first time, Ukraine has released an official video, which is embedded below, showing its Su-25 Frogfoot ground-attack jets employing French-supplied Hammer rocket-boosted precision-guided munitions. The compilation, showing multiple launch angles, reinforces the importance of the weapon to the Ukrainian Air Force, especially when it comes to precisely engaging Russian targets, including those located further back from the front lines. The video montage from the Ukrainian Air Force focuses on the Su-25s of the 299th Tactical Aviation Brigade (299 BrTA) as they attack Russian targets in daylight with the Hammer — also known by the French name Armement Air-Sol Modulaire (AASM; Modular Air-to-Ground Armament). At least 10 different sorties are shown, with the weapons being released in pairs, although only two individual Su-25s — the single-seaters with the Bort numbers '28 Blue' and '47 Blue' — can be identified. All the aircraft in the video have blue and yellow identification panels painted on, to help avoid ‘friendly fire’ incidents, and at least some of the launches are made simultaneous with the release of infrared countermeasures, to spoof hostile heat-seeking missiles. A pair of Hammer munitions fall away after launch from a Ukrainian Su-25. Ukrainian Air Force screencap The Hammer is the first Western precision-guided munition of any kind known to be used by the Ukrainian Su-25 — its integration on the Frogfoot was revealed by a Ukrainian Air Force official in June 2024, as TWZ reported at the time. That the Hammer is being used extensively in combat by Ukraine is no surprise — after all, France previously committed to supplying Kyiv with up to 50 of the precision-guided bombs every month. In November last year, France said that it would deliver 600 of the munitions to Ukraine by the end of 2024, with the Hammers being sourced from existing, aging stocks, with plans in the works to quickly produce more. 'The production of AASM bombs must be significantly accelerated in order to renew the [French] stocks with new munitions,' the French National Assembly Defense Committee stated. 'The Ministry of the Armed Forces now aims to produce 1,200 by 2025.' The weapons are also used by Ukrainian Air Force MiG-29 Fulcrum fighters, and it was on one of these jets that we first got a close-up look at the weapon and its specially adapted launch pylon. The Ukrainian Su-27 Flanker fighter may also use the weapon. A Hammer munition on the specially adapted pylon under the wing of a Ukrainian MiG-29. via X As we have explained in the past, the baseline 250-kilogram (551-pound) version of the Hammer has a standoff range of around 43 miles, putting it roughly on par with the U.S.-made Joint Direct Attack Munition-Extended Range, or JDAM-ER, also used by Ukraine. Unlike the JDAM-ER, however, the French munition doesn’t only rely on a pop-out wing kit to extend its range but is also fitted with a solid-fuel rocket. It should be noted that Hammer munitions can also be employed in an unpowered mode, providing a much-reduced range — if desired. The video compilation doesn’t appear to show any of the munitions underway in powered mode, but since they are all seen very soon after release, it’s likely that their motors simply hadn’t yet fired. As well as the tail-mounted range-extension kit, Hammer adds a nose-mounted guidance section to a NATO-standard ‘dumb’ bomb. All types of Hammer munition have a GPS-assisted inertial navigation system (INS) package that is designed to strike specific fixed target coordinates. There also exist multi-mode guidance options that add either imaging infrared or semi-active laser homing, allowing the weapon to engage moving targets as well as enhancing overall accuracy. This also offers alternative guidance options in GPS-denied environments, which would be particularly relevant on the Ukrainian battlefield. A display depicting different guidance options for the Hammer. Safran However, none of the munitions shown in the 299 BrTA video appear to have the transparent nose associated with the imaging infrared or semi-active laser homing options. This is also in keeping with the Hammers that we have previously seen attached to Ukrainian MiG-29s. The bombs shown are also all 250-kilogram weapons, although Hammer can also be used to adapt 125-kilogram (276-pound), 500-kilogram (1,102-pound), and 1,000-kilogram (2,202-pound) bombs. A graphic showing the core components of the Hammer weapon. Safran The bombs seen in the video all show evidence of a thermal protective coating designed to help delay them from ‘cooking off’ in the event of a fire, something that is otherwise frequently seen on U.S. Navy aircraft ordnance. Also noteworthy is the pylon that the Su-25 uses to launch the Hammer. This is the same as previously seen on the MiG-29 which you can read more about here. A closer view of a Hammer munition with its range-extending wings popping out after launch from a Ukrainian Su-25. Ukrainian Air Force screencap Suffice it to say, the pylon is of a specialized type, sharing the same general form as the one Ukrainian MiG-29s have been using together with U.S.-supplied JDAM-ER glide bombs and which is designed to providing GPS-assisted initial positioning data to their guidance systems just prior to launch. These pylons have a prominent protrusion with a GPS antenna at the forward end. As we have noted in the past, mounting this device on a protrusion will help ensure it has a clear line of sight to the GPS satellite constellation and is not shadowed by the aircraft’s wing structure. A clearer view of the Hammer pylon under the wing of the Su-25 with the protrusion at the front mounting a capped antenna. Ukrainian Air Force screencap Not visible in the video are the other changes that will have been made to accommodate the French-made weapon, specifically the cockpit interface. However, we know by now that Ukraine employs Western-supplied precision-guided munitions via an ad-hoc control system that utilizes iPads or similar tablet-like devices installed in the cockpits.

Photo by Libkos/Getty Images The appearance of the new video underscores what we already knew about the Hammer, namely that it provides the Ukrainian Air Force with a valuable option for conducting precision strikes beyond the front lines while reducing the risks to the launch platforms. The Hammer needs to be released at higher altitudes to get the most reach, although the weapons drops in the video are from a fairly low altitude, making use of a pop-up maneuver to get more range — whether in combination with the rocket booster or in unpowered mode. A graphic provides a highly schematic look at the different employment options for Hammer, including launching it up and over terrain at its target. Safran Based on information from the manufacturer, the Hammer, using its rocket booster, can strike targets at least nine miles away even when released at very low altitudes where the aircraft employing it can better hide from enemy air defenses. The weapon can also be lobbed over terrain, providing a further degree of protection to the launch aircraft. All of this is of particular importance to the pilot of the Su-25, whose mount — due to its relatively low speed and limited agility — is at particular risk from the ever-present threat of Russian air defenses. As for the booster, as well as additional range, this ensures that the Hammer impacts the weapon with a higher energy state than its glide bomb counterparts, meaning it can penetrate further into certain hardened targets. A video shows a MiG-29 employing Hammer using low-altitude toss-bombing techniques that make good use of the munition’s unique design: Footage reportedly showing Ukrainian MiG-29 fighter jet firing French-supplied AASM-250 Hammer guided bombs at a target in Belgorod Oblast of Russia.Notice the very low altitude from which the munitions are being launched.Geolocated impact point: Nekhoteevka border crossing,… pic.twitter.com/mGGuqRAmyK&mdash; Status-6 (Military & Conflict News) (BlueSky too) (@Archer83Able) June 27, 2024 The Su-25 has suffered considerable losses in Ukrainian service (as well as in Russian hands) since the current conflict began. According to the Oryx open-source tracking group, 20 Ukrainian Frogfoot losses can be visually confirmed, with the potential for further attrition on top of this. Nevertheless, with a dire need for tactical airpower, Ukraine has continued to make use of the Su-25, including adapting it to use other Western-made weapons, albeit unguided ones. In the past, we have discussed the use of U.S.-supplied 5-inch Zuni air-launched rockets by Ukrainian Su-25s, although there have been reports that the stocks of these older weapons have now been exhausted. Now, the availability of Hammer munitions means that the Frogfoot still has a useful role to play, despite the very high threat level over the battlefield. A series of photos show Zuni unguided rockets being prepared for arming Ukrainian Su-25s. via X By now, Western-provided precision strike weapons are a familiar feature of the arsenals of Ukraine’s Soviet-era jets, something that would have been almost unthinkable before the start of the full-scale Russian invasion in February 2022. With the F-16 multirole fighter now in Ukrainian service, this might well be the next platform to emerge armed with Hammer. This would have the added benefit of a weapons integration process that is much more straightforward than on Ukraine’s older combat jets, with their need for specially tailored pylons and weapons interfaces as part of ad-hoc solutions.

Chinese Underwater Sea Glider Drone Caught By Fisherman In The Ph...	Authorities in the Philippines are examining what appears to be a Chinese ocean glider-type uncrewed underwater vehicle (UUV) that a fisherman 'caught' earlier this week. At least three similar, if not identical undersea drones were found in various locations around Indonesia between 2019 and 2020. The design looks to be one ostensibly intended for maritime research use, but that could also have military applications. A fisherman recovered the UUV approximately six miles (nine kilometers) off the coast of the San Pascual municipality in Masbate, an island province in the Philippines that lies in the central section of the archipelago nation, on December 30, 2024. The drone, which is said to be around six and a half feet (two meters) long, was turned over first to the Philippine National Police (PNP) and then to the Philippine Navy. A view of the glider-type UUV in PNP custody. PNP Bicol A map showing the general location of the San Pascual municipality in Masbate province in the Philippines. Google Maps The predominantly yellow-painted UUV has a torpedo-esque main body with a single fin and stinger-like protrusion at the rear end. There are also two larger wing-like fins, which are black, attached to the body. Pictures the PNP has released show 'HY-119' and 'HY-L0119' markings on the rear of the drone. The HY-L0119 marking is visible in this picture of the glider-type UUV. PNP Bicol 'Based on our open-source research in the internet… HY-119 refers to a Chinese underwater navigation and communication system,' PNP Bicol regional director Brigadier General Andre Dizon told AFP. 'It has an antenna and an eye that can be used for viewing. Based on our research, this can be used for monitoring and reconnaissance.' Pictures, seen below, do show an aperture or port on top of the nose end of the UUV, as well as what may be rows of smaller ones behind it. There is no obvious propulsion system, which we will come back to momentarily. Another view of the glider-type UUV. PNP Bicol PNP Bicol The UUV recovered near San Pascual looks virtually identical, at least externally, to ones that fishermen in Indonesia recovered on at least three separate occasions between 2019 and 2020. The drones found around the Philippines and Indonesia also have very strong similarities to the Chinese Sea Wing ocean glider-type UUV, which the state-run Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) developed more than a decade ago. Underwater drones of this type use an internal system to alter their buoyancy, repeatedly diving and then surfacing to move forward in the water, aided by the fins along the body and at the tail. Past Chinese state media reports have claimed that Sea Wing can operate for up to 30 days and dive down to a depth of nearly four miles.

As TWZ has noted in the past, these are common tasks for glide-type drones, which are also in service with the U.S. Navy and other military and civilian organizations globally. Sea Wing unmanned undersea vehicles arrayed in front of a Chinese Academy of Sciences research ship. Chinese Academy of Sciences Glider-type UUVs, in general, are also known to be employed for hydrographic survey work and to otherwise support the creation of underwater maps. Having highly accurate charts detailing the contours of the seabed has obvious military utility, especially for submarine operations. Underwater gliders can be used to support other kinds of military activities, as well. For instance, the U.S. Navy has said in the past that it uses these kinds of UUVs to help 'service' fixed underwater sonar sensor 'fields.' However, UUVs of this type do offer far more limited capabilities overall than more advanced underwater drones that have been and continue to be developed and fielded, including by China, in recent years. It is also worth noting that the line between civilian research capabilities and military ones is often muddled in general in China. The country's state-run civilian scientific and engineering organizations like CAS and its subdivisions have close ties directly to the People's Liberation Army (PLA). It does remain unknown what the UUV recovered near San Pascual was doing at the time, as well as whether it was operational or had stopped functioning and drifted there from somewhere else. At the same time, as was the case with the ones that fishermen 'caught' around Indonesia years ago, its appearance, especially in waters well within the bounds of the Philippines archipelago, has real potential national security implications. The PNP itself has made this clear. All of this is only further underscored by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy's (PLAN) own brief seizure of a U.S. Navy glider-type underwater drone in the hotly contested South China Sea back in December 2016. A stock picture of a US Navy glider-type UUV. USN 'The recovery of the HY-119 system has significant implications, as it provides insights into advanced underwater technology and naval capabilities,' the statement from the PNP's Bicol office adds. 'Authorities are closely examining the device as to its origin and to assess its potential impact on national security and maritime operations.' The Philippines could well reach out to allies and partners, especially the United States, to further assist with its ongoing investigation. The U.S. military and the U.S. Intelligence Community have particularly robust so-called Foreign Materiel Exploitation (FME) enterprises that specialize in gleaning a wide variety of information on capabilities and other aspects of captured or otherwise acquired non-American systems. You can learn more about the U.S. government's FME ecosystem in this past TWZ feature. The recovery of the UUV near San Pascual also comes at a time of particularly heightened geopolitical friction between China and the Philippines, primarily over Beijing's widely rejected claims to virtually all of the South China Sea. Last year saw especially aggressive actions on the part of the Chinese Coast Guard and Maritime Militia ships over Scarborough Shoal, which an international tribunal affirmed as belonging to the Philippines in 2016. Chinese authorities continue to ignore that ruling. In the meantime, authorities in the Philippines have stressed that if anyone finds any more underwater drones or other similar objects that they should not touch them and immediately contact the PNP.

How Sailor Poets Take Over U.S. Navy Deck Logs On New Year’s Day	The deck log of a commissioned U.S. Navy ship is generally not the place to mess around. In that humble book, a ship’s officer of the deck (OOD) meticulously notes vital information on weather, sea state, the status of the engineering plant, the ship’s course and speed, along with other mission-critical factors. But in the earliest hours of New Year’s Day, during the mid-watch from midnight to 3 a.m. or 4 a.m., the OOD can let their respective poetic prowess shine through, and write their deck log entry in poem form. The New Year’s deck log entry is a tradition that dates back nearly a century, to 1929, according to the Navy. Sometimes, the OOD will hand the deck log poem duties to another sailor who has a bit more writerly flair. It arguably reached its height during the Vietnam War, when deck log poems became so popular that Navy Times held an annual contest to feature the best of the bunch, according to the National Archives. But as writing increasingly takes a back seat to the phone and other electronic mediums, this Naval tradition has been in decline, and fewer than 20 ships in the nearly 300-ship fleet penned a mid-watch verse as of 2017. But it’s a cool tradition nonetheless, and we are glad to bring you a selection of deck log poems from Navy bridges over the years. Check out the U.S. Naval History and Heritage Command to read more New Year’s Naval poetry from throughout the years too. All the best to you and yours. We’ll see you next year. Quartermaster Seaman Isaiah Kiel reads a New Year's poem as Quartermaster Seaman Dalton Rodgers enters it as the first official deck log entry of 2019 aboard the amphibious assault ship USS Kearsarge (LHD-3) in 2019. (U.S. Navy) USS Gilmer (DD-233), 1942 The Navy destroyer USS Gilmer (DD-233). (U.S. Navy) The ship: This destroyer went right to work in the Pacific after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, conducting submarine patrols and escort duties. It went into a Washington state yard in late 1942 to become a fast transport ship, and was in the Pacific Northwest when Lt. j.g. L.C. Brogger penned his ship’s New Year’s deck log entry. The USS Gilmer's (DD-233) New Year's deck log poem for 1942. (U.S. Navy) The poem: We’re anchored in Port Townsend, With the anchor at short stay. Ready for any emergency, In a minute to get underway. Point Wilson bears three sixteen true From where the anchor lies; The bearing of the light-on-dock Is two seven nought, likewise. The chain is thirty fathoms long The water, seven deep; The Skipper’s in his nice soft bunk Deep in a New Year’s sleep. He hasn’t had one like it For this is the thirtieth day, We’ve hunted Nippon submarines From their base at Crescent Bay. We haven’t found a single one, Despite what fliers say; Their logs and roots and trees and stumps Have kept us underway. Young Blatz is on the sound gear, And Bowles is on the phones, Sheller’s on a machine gun But his thoughts are on his home. ‘Tis the night before New Years And all through the ship Not a creature is stirring Except Judkins – the drip. He’s breaking in the galley To rustle up some Joe, ‘Cause the wind is blowing briskly And the temperature is low. Morton’s in the engine room Keeping his turbines hot. The Boatswain’s Mate is Coxswain Rink Sleeping – like as not. I’ve tried to rhyme my log today But the Navigator’s sure to say, 'Write it up in the regular way.' USS Thresher (SSN-593), 1963 The submarine USS Thresher (SSN-593). (U.S. Navy) The submarine: The first of its class, Thresher’s story is a tragic one, as the boat sunk at sea in April 1963, mere months after this deck log poem was written. All 129 officers, sailors and civilian technicians on board died. It was also the world’s first nuclear-powered submarine to be lost at sea.

Biden Spends Last Of Funds Set Aside To Purchase New Weapons For ...	With three weeks left before President-elect Donald Trump takes office, the Biden administration announced nearly $21 billion in new support for Ukraine. That includes two military aid packages - including the last funds the administration can spend to acquire new weapons for Ukraine. In addition, there is $3.5 billion for direct budgetary assistance to the Ukrainian government and $15 billion in frozen Russian assets. The DoD announced an approximately $1.22 billion Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) package to provide Ukraine with 'additional air defense, air-to-ground, Unmanned Aerial Systems, and other capabilities to fight Russian aggression,' according to the Pentagon. USAI funds are for items that have to be acquired from industry. This package empties that account of funds to procure weapons from industry or partners ahead of the Jan. 20 inauguration of Donald Trump as president. The latest military donations include authorization of a Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) package, with an estimated value of $1.25 billion 'to provide Ukraine additional capabilities to meet its most urgent needs, including missiles for air defense; munitions for rocket systems and artillery; and anti-tank weapons,' the Pentagon said in a statement. This is to send Ukraine weapons currently in U.S. stocks. Unlike USAI money, however, billions remain in the Biden administration's authority to donate these weapons. National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS) (Raytheon/Kongsberg Defense) As we noted earlier this month, the Pentagon was scrambling to allocate about $6.8 billion in funds and authorities before they could dry up under the next administration. With the USAI account emptied and an additional $1.25 billion from the PDA account allocated, that leaves about $4.33 billion left for the Biden administration to directly donate from U.S. weapons stocks to Ukraine. It is unlikely that the entire amount will be spent before the Trump administration takes office, a senior U.S. defense official told reporters, including from The War Zone, earlier this month. 'We will continue to do drawdown packages for the remainder of this administration,' the senior defense official explained at the time. 'But $5.6 billion is a substantial amount of authority, so I would certainly anticipate that there could be remaining authority that would transition and be available for the next administration to use.' The capabilities in this announcement include: • Munitions for National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS);• HAWK air defense munitions;• Stinger missiles;• Counter-Unmanned Aerial Systems (c-UAS) munitions;• Ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS);• 155mm and 105mm artillery ammunition;• Air-to-ground munitions;• High-speed Anti-radiation missiles (HARMs);• Unmanned Aerials Systems (UAS);• Javelin and AT-4 anti-armor systems;• Tube-launched, Optically guided, Wire-tracked (TOW) missiles;• Small arms and ammunition and grenades;• Demolitions equipment and munitions;• Secure communications equipment;• Commercial satellite imagery services;• Medical equipment;• Clothing and individual equipment; and• Spare parts, maintenance and sustainment support, ancillary equipment, services, training, and transportation.

(Ukrainian Air Force Screencap) Since taking office, the Biden administration has provided more than $66 billion in security assistance for Ukraine, according to the Pentagon. '&#8230;my Administration is fully utilizing the funding appropriated by Congress to support the drawdown of U.S. equipment for Ukraine,' Biden said in a statement on Monday. 'I’ve directed my Administration to continue surging as much assistance to Ukraine as quickly as possible — including drawing down older U.S. equipment for Ukraine, rapidly delivering it to the battlefield, and then revitalizing the U.S. defense industrial base to modernize and replenish our stockpiles with new weapons. The Department of Defense is in the process of delivering hundreds of thousands of artillery rounds, thousands of rockets, and hundreds of armored vehicles which will strengthen Ukraine’s hand as it heads into the winter. At my direction, the United States will continue to work relentlessly to strengthen Ukraine’s position in this war over the remainder of my time in office.' Nearly $2.5 billion allocated to Ukraine by the U.S. which includes $1.25 billion drawdown package (PDA) and a $1.22 billion Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) package. NOELREPORTS (@NOELreports) December 30, 2024 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky offered his gratitude for the latest arms packages. 'This support comes at a critical moment, as Russia intensifies its assaults, even resorting to involving North Korean soldiers and continuing to receive weapons from North Korea and Iran,' he said. 'Every act of solidarity from our partners saves lives, strengthens our independence, and reinforces our resilience. It also demonstrates that democracies are stronger then autocratic aggressors.

'Our direct budget support to Ukraine arrives at a critical time as Russia intensifies its attacks on Ukrainian civilians and critical infrastructure,' Yellen said in a statement. 'Economic assistance from the United States and our allies is crucial for Ukraine’s ability to defend its sovereignty and achieve a just peace by maintaining the critical government services that underpin its brave fight.' In coordination with the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Department of State, this $3.4 billion in assistance 'marks the final disbursement of funds appropriated under the bipartisan Ukraine Security Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2024,' Yellen explained. 'Our direct budget support continues to be conditioned on reforms related to strengthening law enforcement, improving transparency and efficiency of government institutions, and bolstering anti-corruption rules and procedures.' Economic assistance from the United States and our allies is crucial for Ukraine’s ability to defend its sovereignty and achieve a just peace by maintaining the critical government services that underpin its brave fight. Secretary Janet Yellen (@SecYellen) December 30, 2024 In addition to aiding Ukraine with its own funds, the U.S. will provide it with $15 billion secured by future revenues from frozen Russian assets, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyal announced on Telegram. 'The relevant agreement was signed by the Ukrainian Ministry of Finance and the World Bank,' he explained. 'These will be funds within the framework of the PEACE in Ukraine project and part of the U.S. contribution of $20 billion under the G7 initiative, which will be directed to social and humanitarian spending. We thank the United States and the World Bank for implementing and supporting the initiative that is making Russia pay for its aggression against Ukraine.'

As we have previously noted, there are mixed signals about what his approach toward this war and future funding for Ukraine might be. Some close to Trump have suggested that the front lines be frozen as they are, Ukraine hold off on joining NATO and European troops keep the peace as part of any agreement to end the war. Russian officials, however, dismissed that concept. 'Judging from numerous leaks and Donald Trump’s interview with Time magazine on December 12, their idea is to suspend hostilities along the line of contact and transfer responsibility for confrontation with Russia to the Europeans,' Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Monday. 'We are not happy, of course, with the proposals made by members of the Trump team to postpone Ukraine’s admission to NATO for 20 years and to station British and European peacekeeping forces in Ukraine. Russia’s position of principle regarding the Ukrainian settlement is well known. It has been put forth by President Vladimir Putin on many occasions, including at the December 19 annual news conference. We have always been ready for talks, and we still are.' Russia is dissatisfied with the reported peace deal proposals on Ukraine from U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s team, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Dec. 29, according to state-owned TASS. The Kyiv Independent (@KyivIndependent) December 29, 2024 Given Russia's early reaction to elements of a potential Trump peace plan, there is no telling how he may position the U.S. when it comes time to determining how much aid Ukraine could receive under his administration. In his recent interview with Time, Trump was pressed on whether there will be continued U.S. support for Ukraine in his administration. He offered a clue about his looming approach. 'I want to reach an agreement, and the only way you're going to reach an agreement is not to abandon,' he said. The Latest On the battlefield, amid continuing Russian gains across the eastern front, Ukraine recaptured some territory it lost this year. Here are some key takeaways from the Institute for the Study of War’s (ISW) latest assessment: Kursk: Russian forces continued assaults in the Ukrainian salient in Kursk Oblast on December 28 and 29 but did not make any confirmed advances. Kharkiv: Russian forces continued ground attacks northeast of Kharkiv City near Hatyshche and Vovchansk on December 28 and 29 but did not make any confirmed advances. Luhansk: Russian forces continued offensive operations along the Kupyansk-Svatove-Kreminna line on December 29 but did not make any confirmed advances. Donetsk: Russian forces continued offensive operations in the Siversk direction on December 30 but did not make any confirmed advances. They recently marginally advanced northwest of Kurakhove, toward Vuhledar and near Velyka Novosilka. Ukrainian forces recently regained lost positions in central Chasiv Yar while both sides recently advanced in the Toretsk and Pokrovsk directions. Kherson: Russian forces continued assaults in the Dnipro direction and on the islands in the Dnipro River Delta on December 29 and 30 but did not make any confirmed advances.

'We now assess that North Korean forces are conducting massed, dismounted assaults against Ukrainian positions in Kursk,' John Kirby said on Friday. 'And these human wave tactics that we're seeing haven't really been all that effective. In fact, we assess that they've resulted in heavy casualties for these North Korean forces. Our estimate is that, to date, they have suffered more than 1,000 killed or wounded in this particular fighting in just the past week of them fighting on the front lines.' Russian and North Korean military leaders 'are treating these troops as expendable and ordering them on hopeless assaults against Ukrainian defenses,' Kirby added. 'These North Korean soldiers appear to be highly indoctrinated, pushing attacks even when it is clear that those attacks are futile. We also have reports of North Korean soldiers taking their own lives rather than surrendering to Ukrainian forces, likely out of fear of reprisal against their families in North Korea in the event that they're captured.'

'These missiles, which have been in use for nearly 40 years, are from Greece’s naval and air force stockpiles and have been deemed unnecessary for operational use by Greek military standards,' the publication reported. Back in January 2023, TWZ reported on how Ukraine was set to receive an undisclosed number of radar-guided RIM-7 missiles, to be integrated into the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ existing Buk air defense systems, known as 'Franken-SAMs' due to their cobbled-together nature. This transfer 'is part of Greece’s broader military aid to Ukraine, which includes artillery shells, weaponry and ammunition,' Ekathimerini stated. 'While the assistance aligns with Greece’s commitment to Ukraine’s defense efforts, it does not diminish Greece’s defense capabilities in the Aegean,' the publication noted. 'Despite repeated requests from allies for advanced systems like the S-300 and Patriot missiles, Athens has firmly declined, citing security concerns and the absence of reliable replacement options.' Greece is set to provide Ukraine with 24 RIM-7 Sea Sparrow Anti-Aircraft Missiles.

It marked the first official Ukrainian delegation to Syria in years. During the trip, he held talks with Syria’s de-facto leader Ahmad Al-Sharaa. 'The first visit of an official Ukrainian delegation to Syria in many years indicates a willingness to open a new page in bilateral relations between the countries,' Sybiha noted on Telegram. 'The elimination of the Russian presence in Syria will contribute to the stability not only of the Syrian state, but also of the entire Middle East and Africa. Even if it takes some time.' Ukraine 'is ready to share with Syria its experience in collecting evidence, investigating, and working to bring war criminals to justice for the crimes they committed,' Sybiha added. In addition, he informed Al-Sharaa that starting Tuesday, 'more than two dozen trucks will arrive in Syria, delivering 500 tons of Ukrainian flour as part of the humanitarian program ‘Grain from Ukraine.’' Ahmad al-Shar’a, Asaad Shaybani, and Anas Katab meets with Ukrainian delegation in Damascus today including Ukraine’s FM Andrii Sybiha.

Zelin (@azelin) December 30, 2024 Ukraine's use of U.S.-made Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) munitions has tailed off, according to The New York Times. The Biden administration shipped Ukraine as many as 500 missiles from Pentagon stockpiles, U.S. officials told the publication. Initially not allowed to use them in Russia, Ukraine began firing them in October 2023 at targets in eastern Ukraine and Crimea held by Russians. The missiles were aimed at hardened command and control posts, weapons storage areas and some other bunkers. Ukraine was finally permitted to fire ATACMS into Russia last month. As we previously reported after Biden gave his go-ahead, the first ATACMS strikes inside Russia took place in the middle of November, at a target in the Bryansk region. At that point, Ukraine had only 'tens of the missiles' left — maybe about 50, the two U.S. officials told the NYT, adding there was no likelihood that Kyiv would get more. 'The limited American supplies had already been assigned for deployment in the Middle East and Asia,' the Times noted. 'Officials in Britain, which allowed Ukraine to use its long-range [Storm Shadow air-based cruise missiles] inside Russia after Mr. Biden’s decision, also said recently that it didn’t have many more to provide.' It is unlikely that Donald Trump will step in to fill the gap when he takes office. He recently told Time magazine that he disagreed 'very vehemently' with Ukraine’s use of ATACMS in Russian territory and called Biden’s decision to provide them 'foolish.' The next day, the Kremlin said Trump’s position 'fully aligned' with Moscow. 'Since the United States and Britain granted permission, Ukraine has launched at least a half-dozen missile strikes, using at least 31 ATACMS and 14 Storm Shadows, according to the Russian Defense Ministry and Russian military bloggers,' the Times explained. 'The Ukrainian military does not comment on the use of the missiles, but neither the United States nor Ukraine has challenged those reports.'

(@Hromadske) December 31, 2024 Ukraine used its new Peklo drone to attack the key Druzhba oil pipeline near the city of Novozybkov in Russia’s Bryansk region, the Russian Mash media outlet reported on Monday. The facility in the village of Mamai, about 35 miles north of the border, was struck Monday at 4:30 a.m. local time, according to Mash. 'The pipeline was not damaged - as a result of the attack, a technical building on the territory was partially destroyed,' Mash stated. 'No one was hurt. The section of the oil pipeline is the last pumping point before the border, Mash noted. 'From there, oil goes to Europe, among other places. The attack came after Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico reminded Ukraine of a possible suspension of electricity supplies. On Dec. 27, Fico announced that his government would evaluate potential reciprocal measures against Ukraine, including halting electricity supplies, if Ukraine stops the transit of Russian gas to Slovakia after January 1. 'After Jan. 1, we will assess the situation and the possibilities of reciprocal measures against Ukraine,' Fico said in a video address.

Ukraine Claims Its Drone Boat Shot Down A Russian Mi-8 Helicopter...	Ukraine says it has used an adapted air-to-air missile fired from an uncrewed surface vessel (USV), better known as a drone boat, to down a Russian Mi-8 Hip helicopter over the Black Sea earlier today. While the results of the engagement haven't been independently verified, they have been confirmed by Russian military bloggers, suggesting this is actually the first time that a USV has been used successfully to bring down an aircraft of any kind. A historic strike: @DI_Ukraine warriors destroyed an aerial target using a Magura V5 naval drone.A russian Mi-8 helicopter was destroyed using R-73 'SeeDragon' missiles near Cape Tarkhankut in temporarily occupied Crimea.Another enemy helicopter was damaged and returned to… pic.twitter.com/AMOiuVEzWe&mdash; Defense of Ukraine (@DefenceU) December 31, 2024 According to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence, the historic engagement took place near Cape Tarkhankut in Russian-occupied Crimea. The missile was fired from a Magura V5 USV operated by the Main Directorate of Intelligence's (GUR) Group 13 unit. Another Russian helicopter, type undisclosed, was reportedly damaged and returned to its airfield. The missile in question, an R-73 (AA-11 Archer) air-to-air missile, has now received the name 'Sea Dragon' in its surface-launched naval application. In the video, one of the drone boats can be seen being hosed with machine gun fire, while at least one of the targeted Mi-8s can be seen releasing infrared flares in an effort to evade the heat-seeking missile. A still from the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence video shows a Russian helicopter apparently in the sights of the USV. Ukrainian Ministry of Defense screencap Evidence of Ukraine arming USVs with heat-seeking air-to-air missiles began to emerge in May of 2024, as TWZ reported at the time. The adaptation was apparently made to provide the USVs with a defense against the Russian helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft that are regularly used to counter them, but it also gives the drone boats a new offensive capability — in addition to their primary role of going after Russian warships and other surface vessels. Until now, it was unclear just how practical the extemporized arrangement was. The latest Ukrainian claims suggest it has proven effective on this occasion, although there remain questions about how the weapons actually work, especially in terms of the engagement process. Speaking today, Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, the head of the GUR, confirmed that there had been several previous unsuccessful efforts to engage Russian helicopters using R-73-armed USVs. The smoke trail left by a n R-73 missile as it heads toward its target, as seen in a still from the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence video. Ukrainian Ministry of Defense screencap A large splash shows the apparent demise of the Russian helicopter. Ukrainian Ministry of Defense screencap The R-73 short-range air-to-air missile that is used to arm some of Ukraine's Magura V5 USVs is potentially a capable surface-to-air weapon, too. As we described when the modification first emerged, the high-off-boresight (HOBS) seeker on the R-73 can articulate a considerable distance in any direction: aided by a helmet-mounted sight, the Archer can be launched in air-to-air engagements against targets with off-boresight angles of +/-75 degrees. This gives the R-73 the potential to be a particularly potent, albeit improvised threat for locking onto and engaging dynamic targets with minimal assisting sensors when used in a surface-launched form. Previous photos confirm that a pair of R-73s can be mounted on angled rails attached to the rear of the USV. A still from a Russian Ministry of Defense video shows a single R-73 on one of two angled rails mounted on the rear of the USV. Russian Ministry of Defense screencap It should also be noted that there several precedents for air-to-air missiles — including the R-73 in particular — being adapted for surface launch. The Yemen-based Houthi militants have adapted R-73s for surface launch against aircraft targets, and used them in combat, as you can read about here. The Houthis added a commercial FLIR as part of that extemporized air defense solution, which has been used to great effect, and it would appear Ukraine has adopted a similar approach for its drone boats. A schematic diagram of the R-73 missile. Public Domain Ukraine, too, has adapted the R-73 for ground launch, adding the missile to the Cold War-era, Soviet-made 9K33 Osa (SA-8 Gecko) mobile short-range air defense system (SHORADS). You can read more about that adaptation here. Close-up of an R-73 missile loaded on an Osa-AKM SHORADS vehicle. Come Back Alive Ukraine has plentiful stocks of R-73s — and likely also the older R-60s that could potentially also be adapted for launch from USVs, although the capabilities of these older missiles are inferior overall. The R-73 remains part of the standard armament for Ukrainian Air Force MiG-29 Fulcrum and Su-27 Flanker fighters.

Ultimately, successful use of R-73s fired from USVs could force Russian rotorcraft to operate further from the drone boats they are targeting, even if the probability of kill is not especially high, and the overall range of the missile markedly reduced from the 8.7 miles that can be achieved against a tail-on target when launched (in optimum conditions) in an air-to-air engagement. An R-73 air-to-air missile on display. Black bands on the weapon indicate an inert round. Vitaly V. Kuzmin/Wikimdia Commons The Russian helicopters that appear to be the favoured weapon against the Ukrainian USVs are primarily armed with heavy machine guns, unguided rockets, and potentially anti-tank guided missiles. None of these offer the standoff range that would allow the helicopters to engage USVs before coming within the engagement envelope of the R-73. The wreckage of an R-73 on a Ukrainian USV that was washed ashore and fell into Russian hands earlier this year. via X While we wait for independent verification of the success of the USV in shooting down a Mi-8, there's meanwhile no doubt that the adaptation has the potential to inflict further losses on the Russian military in the Black Sea. In particular, the development complicates Russia's actions when it comes to countering Ukrainian drone boats, providing the USVs with a deterrent and a powerful means of shooting back — more powerful than the machine-gun-armed USVs that we have previously seen in action against Russian helicopters. This is yet another calculus in the fast-evolving drone war in the Black Sea region. Already, Ukrainian USVs have inflicted disproportionate losses on Russian surface vessels operating in the Black Sea. The latest development is a further reminder of the willingness of the Ukrainian Armed Forces to improvise innovative weapons systems and to introduce these relatively rapidly to counter new and emerging threats.

39 A-10 Warthogs Went To The Boneyard This Year, More Than Double...	The U.S. Air Force sent at least 39 A-10s to the boneyard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona this year, more than double the number of Warthogs it sent into mothballs in 2023. The service is pushing steadily ahead with plans to retire the type for good before the end of the decade, if not well before then, though the venerable ground attack aircraft continue to see combat in the interim. An A-10 arrives at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base to be put in the boneyard in July 2024. USAF Data on A-10 retirements come from official monthly inventory reports from the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) released between January and September. The 309th AMARG manages the boneyard and received 17 Warthogs in 2023. There were 50 A-10As and 107 A-10Cs in storage in total, many of which are in non-flyable condition, as of September 2024. How many additional A-10s may have headed into retirement in the past three months is unknown. An example of the condition of some of the A-10s that have been at the boneyard for years now. USAF / J.M. Eddins Jr An example of the condition of some of the A-10s at the boneyard. USAF / J.M. Eddins Jr When Fiscal Year 2024 began on October 1 of last year, there were 218 A-10s in service across the Air Force, according to separate data released back in March as part of the annual U.S. defense budget request rollout. The 39 Warthogs that went to the boneyard this year represent nearly 20 percent of that total. The Air Force currently plans to retire the last of the ground attack jets, which it argues have ever-more limited survivability and general utility, especially in any future high-end operations, such as a conflict in the Pacific against China, no later than 2030. The Air Force only began retiring A-10s in earnest in 2023. For years, members of Congress had actively blocked the retirement of Warthogs, in part over questions about the ability of other aircraft, especially stealth F-35s, to fill in any potential gap in close air support capacity. Some of the debate to date has centered around the impending loss of the A-10's famed seven-barrel 30mm GAU-8/A Avenger Gatling-type cannon. The internally-mounted 25mm cannon on the Air Force's F-35As has also suffered serious issues over the years and whether or not they have been sufficiently resolved is unclear. At the same time, it is worth noting that the ground combat jets' operations have steadily trended toward the employment of precision-guided munitions rather than strafing runs over the past two decades or so. A report from the Pentagon's Office of the Director of Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) on a controversial flyoff between the A-10 and the F-35 conducted between 2018 and 2019 only emerged this year and in a highly redacted form after having been effectively buried. The independent Project on Government Oversight (POGO) only obtained that document, which is dated February 2022, through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request and subsequent ligation. You can read more about the report, which raises more questions than it provides answers in many areas, here. Regardless, the overall view of the A-10 in Congress has clearly shifted in recent years. The most recent annual defense policy bill for the 2025 Fiscal Year, which President Joe Biden signed into law earlier this month, includes a provision explicitly reducing the minimum number of Warthogs that the Air Force has to legally keep in operational service from 135 to 96. The Air Force has already laid out extensive plans for a post-A-10 force structure across its active duty components, as well as the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard. Just in November, the service announced that the 25th Fighter Squadron at Osan Air Base in South Korea would start divesting its 24 Warthogs next month. What will happen to that squadron afterward and what additional aircraft might take their place at Osan is unclear. Osan-based A-10s fly together with a South Korean Air Force KA-1 Woongbi light aircraft. ROKAF Earlier this year, the Air Force formally decided that the Maryland Air National Guard's 175th Wing would lose its Warthogs and gain a non-flying cyber operations mission in return. However, earlier this month, a separate administrative decision was also made to shift the District of Columbia Air National Guard's F-16-equipped 121st Fighter Squadron to the Maryland Air National Guard. Last year, the Air Force had also announced that the active-duty 23rd Wing at Moody Air Force Base in Georgia and the Idaho Air National Guard’s 124th Fighter Wing Gowen Field Air National Guard Base would be trading in their A-10s for F-35s and F-16s, respectively. The face of Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, long itself an A-10 hub, is also set to change as a result of impending Warthog retirements. The base is slated to become home to an expanded 492nd Special Operations Wing flying OA-1K Sky Warden light attack aircraft and MC-130J Commando II special operations tanker/transports. The 492nd, which is currently based at Hurlburt Field in Florida, will support other non-flying Air Force special operations mission sets, as well. The OA-1K Sky Warden. L3Harris This year was also the last season for the A-10C Demonstration Team, reducing the Warthog's role in the Air Force's recruitment and public relations efforts. The Air Force's remaining A-10s have continued to receive some of their most substantial upgrades in recent memory just in the past few years, including the ability to employ GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs (SDB). Many of the Warthogs still in service have also gotten new wings that have added thousands of flight hours to service lives. An A-10 loaded with 16 GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs seen during a test. USAF Despite the ongoing retirement efforts, A-10s are still flying combat missions. Warthogs were among the aircraft sent to the Middle East in October amid fears of further escalation in direct conflict between Israel and Iran and other crises in the region. The ground attack jets have since been actively used just in recent weeks to conduct strikes in Syria amid the new uncertainty in that country following the ouster of longtime dictator Bashar Al Assad. There have been suggestions that the A-10s could serve on with foreign air arms, including those of Jordan and Ukraine, after the U.S. Air Force retires the type for good. At least in the United States, the Warthog's career is more and more firmly in its twilight period, especially with the ramping up of jets heading to the boneyard this year.

The Time Navy Lt. Jimmy Carter Was Lowered Into A Partially Melte...	President Jimmy Carter’s time as a U.S. Navy officer might have been brief, but it served to inform the rest of his days before passing away Sunday at the age of 100. Prior to his political career and Nobel Prize-winning peacemaking efforts, Carter stood at the side of the father of the nuclear Navy during its infancy, and even got lowered into a melted-down nuclear reactor as a junior officer. Decades later, the former president was stunned to learn of the capabilities carried by the secretive spy submarine that bears his name to this day. Ensign James Earl 'Jimmy' Carter graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1946, and applied to join the Navy’s nuclear submarine community a few years later, according to the Navy. Assigned to the experimental attack submarine USS Barracuda (SSK-1), Carter had served as executive officer, engineering officer and electronics repair officer by the time he crossed paths with then-Capt. Hyman G. Rickover, the future admiral widely credited with birthing America’s nuclear sub fleet and ending a Navy practice of naming submarines after fish. Following that interview, Rickover soon tapped Carter to join the nascent effort. On temporary duty with the Naval Reactors Branch to help design and develop nuclear propulsion plants, the junior officer at times struggled to keep up with Rickover’s demanding pace. Former President Jimmy Carter becomes an ensign upon graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1946. (Jimmy Carter Library and Museum) Nonetheless, Carter wrote in his 1975 presidential campaign tome 'Why Not The Best?' about how Rickover left a stark impression on him, as historian Glenn Robins recalled for the U.S. Naval Institute: 'The young Carter was near the end of a two-hour interview with Rickover, which had come to function as a rite of passage for anyone seeking entrance to the Navy’s nascent nuclear submarine program, when Rickover brought up the topic of Carter’s standing at the U.S. Naval Academy. After Carter proudly announced ranking in the top 10 percent of the class of 1947, Rickover pointedly asked, ‘Did you do your best?’ Carter hesitated but answered truthfully that he had not. To which the captain queried, ‘Why not?’' Before becoming the 39th President of the United States Jimmy Carter was a nuclear baddie.He was a U.S. Naval Academy graduate and got handpicked by the iconic Admiral Hyman G.

It prompted Carter 'to undergo a life-changing period of self-reflection that compelled the young sailor ‘to make the maximum effort in every single thing he did for the rest of his life,' Robins wrote. Rickover would go on to provide counsel to President Carter on a variety of topics through the years. President Jimmy Carter, right, and Navy Adm. Hyman G. Rickover during a tour of the attack submarine USS Los Angeles (SSN-688) in 1977. (U.S. Navy) After Carter joined the Navy’s nuclear efforts, the 28-year-old and his crew were sent to repair the Chalk Water nuclear reactor near Ottawa, Canada, in late 1952. The reactor had suffered a partial meltdown, and a team was needed to shut it down, take it apart and replace it. Carter and the rest of the team took a train up north and soon got to work. 'They built an identical replica of the reactor on an adjacent tennis court to precisely run through the repair procedures, due to the maximum time humans could be exposed to the levels of radiation present in the damaged area,' a Navy history recounts. 'Each member of the 22 member team could only be lowered into the reactor for 90-second periods to clean up and repair the site.' Official accounts don’t clarify whether Carter was in command during the mission, or his precise role. Still, the future president did his part, Canadian journalist Arthur Milnes later recounted. 'He was lowered into the building … with his wrench, and he had to run over to the reactor casing and he had one screw to turn,' Milnes said after interviewing Carter about the incident. 'That was all the time he had. And then, boom, back up.' Carter and the others were regularly tested after the mission was finished to look for long-term health effects. 'They let us [crew members] get probably a thousand times more radiation than they would now.' Carter told CNN in 2008 while reflecting on the incident. 'We were fairly well-instructed then on what nuclear power was, but for about six months after that, I had radioactivity in my urine.' Former President Jimmy Carter is piped aboard during his arrival at the change of command ceremony for the Seawolf class attack submarine USS Jimmy Carter (SSN-23) at Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor, Washington, in 2015. (U.S. Navy) In his autobiography, 'A Full Life, Reflections at Ninety,' Carter recounted the distinctive perils of being a submarine officer: 'Although some enlisted men could concentrate almost exclusively on their own fields of responsibility as engine men, electricians, torpedo experts, boatswains, quartermasters, gunners or operators of navigation and fire control equipment, every officer was expected to master all of these disciplines…we knew one mistake could endanger everyone aboard.' Through much of 1953, Carter served as the engineering officer for the USS Seawolf (SSN-575), the Navy’s second nuclear submarine. But life soon happened, and following his fathers death in July of that year, Carter resigned his Navy commission and returned to Georgia to oversee his family interests. The onetime junior officer later entered local politics and was elected president in 1976, serving one term. Decades later, the Seawolf class fast-attack submarine USS Jimmy Carter (SSN-23) was commissioned in 2005. The submarine’s commanding officer, Don Kelso, and a retired Navy admiral arrived at Carter’s Georgia home early that year to brief the 39th president on what the submarine could do, The New York Times’ John Ismay reported. 'He was in awe,' Kelso was quoted as saying. 'He knew it was a special submarine, because he had some background there, but he didn’t know all the details before then of what it could really do.' What the Jimmy Carter and its sailors have done on deployment remains a highly guarded secret within the Pentagon, and The New York Times cited an unnamed former senior Navy official as saying that just a few officers and a few dozen people on land actually know what missions the sub undertakes at sea. The secretive spy submarine USS Jimmy Carter (SSN-23). (U.S. Navy) TWZ has extensively reported on the Jimmy Carter, the other two submarines in its Seawolf class, and why the former president had reason to be awed when briefed on his namesake’s capabilities: 'The Jimmy Carter is the last of only three Seawolf class submarines ever built, but its hullform is different than its sister ships. During construction, it had a large plug placed in the center of its hull, making the boat substantially longer than the other two Seawolf class boats.' 'This plug accommodates room for lockout chambers, underwater remotely operated vehicles, and cargo bays for delivering and retrieving outsized cargo. A slew of other modifications were also made to the vessel. You can read all about them, as well as about the Jimmy Carter in general, in this prior feature profile I wrote about the submarine. Suffice it to say that the USS Jimmy Carter’s primary mission is espionage and spying. It can manipulate communications cables deep under the surface of the ocean and even locate and retrieve sensitive material sitting on the sea floor. It truly is America’s ultimate spying tool, and it can still hunt and fight like a normal Seawolf class fast attack submarine if it has to.' The ship’s crest recognizes the influences on Carter’s life. It features a presidential seal flanked by an atomic energy symbol and a wooden wheel. That wheel pays homage to Carter’s surname, which came from a word meaning 'wheel-maker,' according to The New York Times. The crest’s bottom features the words 'Semper Optima,' Latin for 'always the best,' which was an acknowledgement of Rickover’s formative words to Carter during his time in the sea service. The crest of the Seawolf class attack submarine USS Jimmy Carter (SSN-23) pays homage to the former president's roots. (U.S. Navy) Carter visited his sub’s crew in the summer of 2005, and got underway for an 'overnight V.I.P. cruise' following the boat’s commissioning, The New York Times recounted. 'He drove the ship,' The New York Times quoted Kelso as saying. 'And I remember I was amazed because he must have been 81 at the time, and both he and Mrs. Carter climbed up a 25-foot ladder to get to the top of the submarine’s sail and rode with us as we took the ship out to sea.' 'When we dove, he got to drive from the helmsman’s station down below, and later he went down to the mess decks to meet with the ship’s crew several times,' Kelso added. 'And I think he had a ball.' During his top-secret briefing that year on the Jimmy Carter’s capabilities, The New York Times reported, the former president said his namesake could easily take out the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan (CVN-76), named after the man who beat Carter for the presidency in 1980. Former President Jimmy Carter, center and 87 at the time, sported a proximity suit during a tour of the amphibious assault ship USS Peleliu (LHA-5) in 2012. (U.S. Navy) Carter lived an extraordinary life, by all accounts. His time in the submarine community played a critical role in all that came after, and he remained a Navy man until the end. 'You and I leave here today to do our common duty—protecting our Nation's vital interests by peaceful means if possible, by resolute action if necessary,' Carter told the graduating class of Naval Academy midshipmen in 1978. 'We go forth sobered by these responsibilities, but confident of our strength. We go forth knowing that our Nation's goals—peace, security, liberty for ourselves and for others—will determine our future and that we together can prevail.'

North Korea’s New Warship Appears To Be Designed For Vertical Lau...	North Korea's new warship design has emerged and it appears to be the largest the country has yet constructed. The vessel, which looks to be around the size of a typical modern frigate, or at the least a very large corvette, also appears to be designed to accommodate a vertical launch system (VLS) for missiles, and a phased-array radar, two advanced items not previously seen on a North Korean design. Photos of the new warship, the name of which has not been disclosed, were recently released by North Korea's state-run Korean Central Television (KCTV). The vessel is seen being inspected by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un while under construction in a dry dock at Nampho Shipyard, on the Taedong River estuary, on the west coast of the country. A view of the bow of the vessel, with shipyard officials and Kim in attendance, reveals its impressive size. KCNA The photos are undated, but the oldest shows the construction facility covered by netting, to hide it from view, but this is later seen replaced by a more permanent roof structure. According to NK Pro, which provides data analysis on North Korea, the earliest photo was probably taken before October of this year, since this is when the roof was added. Kim is pictured visiting the new warship under construction, likely in October or some time after. KCNA Imagery analysis from the same outlet suggests that Kim visited the warship under construction on at least one other earlier occasion. Previous photos of the vessel appeared in November, during a defense exhibition in North Korea, but they only showed the bow area and with very limited detail as they can only be seen in wide-angle images released of the event. The first photos of the new warship appeared on a display at a North Korean military exhibition in November. KCNA/NK Pro Before that, in September, Kim was photographed inspecting the ship and this photo was also published by state media. However, the photo was heavily cropped and there was little idea of the scale or the overall appearance of the vessel. One of the four new photos also appears to have been taken during that same visit. As for the size of the new vessel, Joseph Dempsey, Research Associate for Defence and Military Analysis at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) determines that it's 'likely a destroyer and the largest warship ever constructed in the DPRK.' According to Dempsey's previous analysis, 'the design appears to have an approximately 15-meter (50-foot) beam,' making it around one-third wider than the Amnok and Tuman class corvettes, which are the largest warships that North Korea has built for decades. The Amnok and Tuman class are both approximately 250 feet long, a typical length for a modern corvette, although the distinction between warship types — especially frigates and corvettes — is increasingly blurred. One of North Korea's Amnok class corvettes. KCNA Larger than the Amnok and Tuman class are the Najin class frigates dating from the 1970s, with a beam of around 33 feet and a length of 328 feet. Only two or three of these aging vessels are thought to still be in North Korean service. An aerial port-Nside view of a North Korean Navy Najin class corvette underway. U.S. Navy Allied Navy Dempsey suggests that the new warship is 'more than 100 meters (328 feet) long,' although it would have to be significantly longer than this to be considered a destroyer, in the modern understanding of that classification, with modern frigates already typically being longer than 328 feet. The Franco-Italian FREMM frigate is 465 feet long, and the Chinese Type 054 frigate is 440 feet long, for example. Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the new warship design is the apparent provision for some kind of vertical launch system (VLS), the presence of which is suggested by a large space immediately forward of the bridge. While there isn't a VLS has been installed so far, this would make sense considering the design and would reflect the weapons configurations on many other modern surface combatants. A view of the area forward of the bow reveals an aperture that may well be intended to accommodate a VLS. KCNA Provided that the new warship is intended to have a VLS, there are a variety of different kinds of missile that might be considered as payloads. These would include naval versions of surface-to-air missiles, as well as possibly anti-ship missiles, but North Korea is also increasingly focusing on the development of land attack cruise missiles — including some which are claimed to be nuclear-armed. More importantly, should a VLS is fitted, it would therefore provide the warship with much more magazine depth than previous North Korean warships, with the ability to field multiple types of weapons in a single launcher. An Amnok class corvette fires a cruise missiles. Reportedly, these missiles can be fitted with nuclear warheads. KCNA Notably, North Korea has also previously said it had plans for 'constantly deploying a ship loaded with new-type anti-aircraft missiles.' That might also be a reference to the new warship, and its potential VLS capability. The statement was an explicit threat to U.S. reconnaissance aircraft operating off the North Korean coast. While North Korea is currently busy with a wide range of military developments — with its missile programs gaining the most attention for its rapid advances — Kim has, in recent months, made statements focused on the maritime domain especially. Earlier this year, state media quoted Kim as saying that increasing the power of its naval forces is 'the most important issue in reliably defending the maritime sovereignty of the country and stepping up the war preparations at present.' He also called for '​​pushing ahead with the planned building of ships and unconditionally completing them within the period of the Five-Year Plan.' Kim observes a missile firing drill from aboard a North Korean patrol boat. KCNA Although not explicitly named as such, it seems likely that the new vessel is part of this warship-building program and it certainly fits within aspirations to develop naval capabilities, although it's unclear how many of the hulls might be planned. Should the first of the new vessels be completed 'within the period of the Five-Year Plan,' this would imply that it would be finished by January 2026. Based on the progress made so far, that would seem feasible, although it remains to be seen exactly what kinds of weapons and sensors might be installed and there would still be a period of testing and working up before the warship is actually commissioned into service. Another view of an Amnok class corvette. KCNA There has already been speculation that the new warship might end up going to sea with a phased-array radar, due to the large apertures on the sides of the superstructure that would accommodate the antennas for such a system. A combination of VLS and phased-array radar would strongly suggest the warship is intended to serve in an air-defense-optimized role, filling a long-standing gap in the fleet for an anti-air picket ship. Apertures cut into the forward part of the superstructure are inline with the typical locations of phased-array radar antennas. KCNA With the previous Amnok and Tuman class, a handful of vessels have been completed in shipyards on the east and west coasts, and it's possible that the new design might superseded these less-capable designs in the same yards. As well as the new vessel, North Korea is meanwhile working on other surface combatants, including smaller anti-submarine warfare vessels and missile boats, and some more innovative designs like the Nalchi class very slender vessel (VSV) with a wave-piercing hull. In addition, North Korea is also developing underwater capabilities, although with mixed successes so far. However, there has been recent evidence that Pyongyang might be developing its first nuclear-powered submarine design, which also underscores its significant naval ambitions. You can read more about that here. A satellite image of the Pongdae Submarine Factory on the northeast coast of North Korea, the center of its submarine development activities. Google Earth For now, while the size of North Korea's latest warship design is impressive and while it certainly has the potential to carry a comprehensive range of armament and sensors, major questions remain about Pyongyang's abilities to field higher-end naval military technologies in a fully applicable, integrated form. Even if North Korea is able to introduce a new warship with a usable radar system and a VLS array able to launch multiple types of missiles, it still remains to be seen whether the country has the shipbuilding capacity to build a more meaningful number of these warships.

Russian Fighter Jets Still At Syrian Base, Top Rebel Leader Pushe...	Al Jazeera has released a new video that it says shows Russian combat jets still at Khmeimim Air Base in Syria despite ongoing withdrawals. The fate of Russia's presence at Khmeimim, as well as its Tartus naval base, remains a hot topic of interest globally three weeks after the fall of long-time Syrian dictator and ally of Moscow Bashar Al Assad. Just this weekend, the head of the rebel coalition that ousted Assad pushed back on calls for a complete disengagement with the Kremlin, including when it comes to military affairs. Al Jazeera released the new footage of Khmeimim (also written Hmeimim), taken using a drone and seen below, earlier today, but did not say when it was shot. A machine translation of the accompanying Arab text says 'exclusive footage from Al Jazeera shows a large presence of warplanes inside the Russian Hmeimim base.' TWZ was not able to directly align what is seen in the clips with available satellite taken of the base recently. Other similar but distinctly different footage of Khmeimim captured using a drone had emerged back on December 12. مشاهد خاصة للجزيرة تظهر تواجد كبير لطائرات حربية داخل قاعدة حميميم الروسية#فيديو pic.twitter.com/uECy9iUndG&mdash; الجزيرة سوريا (@AJA_Syria) December 30, 2024 The footage from Al Jazeera does show three Flanker-series fighters and a swing-wing Su-24 Fencer combat jet under protected shelters at the northeastern end of the base are clearly seen at one point. Another view shows what looks to be four more Flankers and/or Su-34 Fullbacks (which both have prominent 'stingers' that extend from their tail ends), as well as six additional Fencers. The video from Al Jazeera also shows additional aircraft and other activity at Khmeimim, including two Russian Il-76 Candid cargo planes and another one belonging to Syrian Airlines, on an open apron at the northwestern end of the facility. The Syrian Airlines Il-76 may be one that went missing in the final chaotic moments before Assad's fall, as you can read more about here. Smaller An-26 Curl and An-72 Coaler cargo aircraft, as well as an An-30 Clank, are visible elswhere at Khmeimim in the latest footage from Al Jazeera. The An-30 is ostensibly an aerial survey aircraft, but can also be used as a transport. The video prominently shows ground-based radars still in operation at the base, as well. At least one of the radars looks to be a variant of the P-18, which can be used for air traffic control and general air surveillance. At the same time, even in the drone footage Al Jazeera has now put out, there are signs that Russia is continuing to withdraw from Khmeimim. The video shows smoke billowing from an area just off to the side of the open apron where the Il-76s are parked, which could be from the burning of materiel. Destroying certain assets in place using fire and other means is commonly seen when military forces depart overseas facilities, especially if they have to do so on relatively short notice following major upheaval in a country.

Russia's military had already removed air defenses, including an S-400 surface-to-air missile system, and other materiel from Khmeimim. Russian forces that had been deployed elsewhere in Syria have also been congregating in recent weeks at the base, which is now under the watchful eye of rebel forces.

The Russian cargo ship Ursa Major, which may have been headed for Tartus, notably sank in the Mediterranean last week after reportedly suffering an explosion in its engine room. Much about the circumstances surrounding the incident remains unclear, as you can read more about here.

The facilities offer the Kremlin highly strategic and unique air and naval power projection nodes for operations in the Mediterranean and Africa. Russia's intervention in Syria beginning in 2015 was instrumental in keeping Assad in power and, by extension, retaining access to these important facilities. The regime in Damascus rewarded Moscow by essentially gifting it the bases through a 49-year 'lease' deal in 2017. There are reports that Russia could be redeploying forces from Syria to bases in Libya and elsewhere in Africa. A view of a gate to Khmeimim Air Base on December 29, 2024.

AAREF WATAD/AFP via Getty Images AAREF WATAD Russia's relationship with Assad and its active operations against the same rebels now seeking to form a new Syrian government have raised obvious questions about the future of its bases in the country. Combat jets at Khmeimim were still flying strikes against rebel forces right up until the collapse of the former regime. However, 'we don't want Russia to exit Syria in a way that undermines its relationship with our country,' Ahmad Al Sharaa said in an interview with Saudi Arabian state-owned news outlet Al Arabiya this weekend. 'We do not want Russia to leave Syria in the way that some wish.' Al Sharaa, still better known by his nom de guerre Abu Mohammad Al Jolani (and other simply just as Jolani), is head of Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which led the rebel coalition that deposed Assad. 'All of Syria's arms are of Russian origin, and many power plants are managed by Russian experts,' Al Sharaa further told Al Arabiya, while also highlighting the 'deep strategic interests' of what he described as the 'second most powerful country in the world.' Ahmad Al Sharaa addresses a crowd at Umayyad Mosque in Damascus in the immediate aftermath of the fall of Assad's regime on December 8, 2024. Aref TAMMAWI/AFP via Getty Images In his interview with Al Arabiya, Al Sharaa also said that 'Syria cannot continue without relations with an important regional country like Iran,' but stressed that relations 'must be based on respect for the sovereignty of both countries and noninterference in the affairs of both countries.' The HTS leader has been particularly vocal in his criticism of the regime in Tehran, another one of Assad's major foreign benefactors, and how it wields its regional influence. Since the fall of Assad, Al Sharaa has been very actively working broadly to present the new government HTS is working to form as a pragmatic and moderate entity. HTS is an evolution of an Al Qaeda franchise in Syria, but claimed to have broken ties with the international terrorist organization in 2016. HTS itself remains a designated terrorist group in Russia, as well as the United States and many other countries. The U.S. government is reportedly set to withdraw a $10 million bounty on Al Sharaa personally following a visit to the country by an American delegation earlier this month. As the fledging government in Damascus works to move Syria beyond its pariah status under Assad, it is also facing pressure to realign itself, particularly away from Russia. Ukraine has notably been positioning itself as an alternative partner for the new Syrian government. Ukrainian operatives had reportedly worked with Syrian rebel groups, particularly when it came to providing assistance in expanding their kamikaze drone capabilities, in the lead-up to the fall of Assad. 'We believe that from a strategic point of view, the removal of Russia’s presence in Syria will contribute to the stability of not only the Syrian state but the entire Middle East and Africa,' Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha‎ said in a statement around an official visit to Damascus just today where he met with Al Sharaa and others. 'The Russian and Assad regimes supported each other because they were based on violence and torture.' Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha‎, at left, meets with Ahmad Al Sharaa, at right, in Damascus, on December 30, 2024. Ali Haj Suleiman/Getty Images For their part, Russian authorities have persistently claimed that no final decision has been reached on Khmeimim and Tartus, despite reports that they could be on the verge of being forced out of Syria. HTS-led authorities in Damascus still face broad challenges in establishing a functional nationwide government in a country where various other domestic and international actors continue to hold significant sway. Fighting between Turkish-supported and U.S.-backed forces in the northeastern end of the country has spiked since the fall of Assad. Israel is also now occupying a portion of southern Syria, ostensibly as a buffer zone amid the ongoing geopolitical uncertainty. Israeli and American forces have also taken advantage of the newly permissive airspace over Syria, especially the once heavily guarded western end of the country, to launch major airstrikes in recent weeks targeting former regime military assets and ISIS terrorists, respectively. For the moment, at least, Russia does continue to maintain a military presence in Syria, including combat jets still at Khmeimim, despite the continued signs of withdrawal.
