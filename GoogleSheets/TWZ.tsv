New Details About T-7A Red Hawk Jet Trainer Ejection System Woes ...	New information about serious and potentially dangerous deficiencies with the emergency ejection system on the U.S. Air Force's new T-7A Red Hawk jet trainer has been released. Environmental testing of the Red Hawk last year also exposed new problems that need to be addressed. The Air Force has been working with manufacturer Boeing to fix or otherwise mitigate a host of issues with the T-7A, which have already led to significant delays and prompted a recent shakeup of the overall plans for the program. The Pentagon's Office of the Director of Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) provided new updates on T-7A program in its most recent annual report, which it released last week. The report covers work done on various programs during Fiscal Year 2024, which ended on September 30 of last year. TWZ has reached out to the Air Force and Boeing for any information on additional developments since then related to the Red Hawk's ejection system, the problems uncovered in the environmental testing, and other issues. You can read more about what has previously been disclosed about T-7A testing in this recent TWZ feature. The T-7A flew for the first time in 2023 and, as of December 2024, the Air Force had taken delivery of five pre-production test jets.

'As reported in the FY22 and FY23 Annual Reports, the T-7A emergency escape system does not meet minimum safety requirements for the Air Force’s airworthiness certification and is currently operating with high-risk acceptance for air worthiness,' according to DOT&E. 'A February 2024 sled test showed improvement at medium-speed ejections for the ejection seat sequencing.' However, 'the program executed a high-speed test in June 2024 where the seat sequenced correctly, but a seat hose interfered with the seat sequencer switch, which could lead to an incorrect ejection mode,' the new report adds. 'In the same test, the redesigned canopy fracturing system pattern did not function properly. The program must successfully complete seven more sled tests before the escape system can be certified for airworthiness and IOT&E [initial operational test and evaluation].' The two-seat T-7A features ACES 5 ejection seats from Collins Aerospace, a subsidiary of Raytheon (now formally called RTX). Previous testing had uncovered problems with the complete emergency egress system that presented serious safety risks, especially for smaller and lighter female pilots, and during ejections at speeds under 250 knots. As DOT&E notes in its latest report, work has already been ongoing to address these deficiencies, which have been a key driver in delays to date. 'In February 2024, the program completed initial cold and hot weather testing at the McKinley Climatic Laboratory in Eglin, Florida. This initial round of testing revealed several problems that require a second test event at the McKinley Laboratory in 3QFY25 [third quarter Fiscal Year 2025, which begins in April],' DOT&E has also now disclosed. The report does not provide any specific details about the problems encountered in the environmental testing. The Air Force did publicly announce the environmental testing at McKinley last year and said one of the T-7As had been subjected to temperatures as low as negative 25 degrees and as high as 110 degrees, both in Fahrenheit, as well as extreme humidity. The service made no mention of any problems at that time. The T-7A undergoing hot temperature testing at the McKinley Climatic Laboratory. USAF Samuel King Jr. The T-7A seen frozen during the cold temperature portion of the environmental testing at the McKinley Climatic Laboratory. USAF Samuel King Jr. Other additional issues have been dogging the T-7A, but efforts continue to address or mitigate them. 'The [Red Hawk] program office also continued to make progress on the T-7A OBOGS [On-Board Oxygen Generation System]. The draft T-7A OBOGS test plan calls for 46 data points collected over 10 ground and 100 hours of flight test events, including high and sustained-g maneuvering,' DOT&E's new report says. 'The integrated test team will continue to collect OBOGS test data during future IOT&E, as system components age and approach regularly scheduled maintenance and replacement. DOT&E will evaluate OBOGS performance in accordance with the current military standards document (MIL-STD-3050A), which incorporates lessons learned from several fighter aircraft mishaps.' As alluded to here, several U.S. military aircraft types have suffered from OBOGS-linked issues in recent years, some which have contributed to fatal mishaps, as TWZ has covered extensively in the past. 'AGCAS [Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System] is another known suitability limitation [for the T-7A]. Fighter aircraft employ AGCAS to prevent loss of life during sustained high-g maneuvers, which can cause the pilot to lose consciousness,' according to DOT&E. 'While the formal requirements for APT [the Advanced Pilot Training program] did not include AGCAS, the program office is developing a strategy to start AGCAS integration in FY26.' Furthermore, 'the majority of test points in the government DT [developmental test] test plan remain untested. These events include structural loads, subsystems, tanker formation, crew systems, On-Board Oxygen Generation System (OBOGS), mission systems, and high angle-of-attack testing, which have the potential to drive further software and flight control changes,' DOT&E highlights in latest report. That being said, 'the program appears to have a clear pathway to resolving known effectiveness issues, such as limited sortie duration and flight characteristics at high angles-of-attack.' One of the pre-production T-7As. USAF USAF In 2021, Boeing said it resolved an issue involving wing-rock at high angles of attack, in part through the use of digital engineering processes. DOT&E's report indicates that additional testing was still needed to validate that fix as of the end of Fiscal Year 2024. It's also worth noting here that the T-7A has been a poster child for the benefits of digital engineering and design tools, which Boeing has notably touted as making it easier to address issues uncovered during developmental testing. However, a significant consensus has emerged that these technologies have not shown themselves to be as revolutionary as hoped, as you can read more about here. Whether or not the issues highlighted in DOT&E latest report had been further addressed or mitigated in any way in the past four months, the T-7A program is already substantially delayed. The Air Force had hoped to reach initial operational capability with the Red Hawk in 2024, but that has now slipped to 2028. The service does not now even expect to order its first production T-7As until 2026. Earlier this month, the Air Force announced major changes to the overall T-7A program plan, including its intention to purchase four more pre-production examples to support ongoing testing. Boeing has also been using two demonstrator aircraft to support work on the Red Hawk. The demonstrators were originally built as part of the company's winning submission for the T-X jet trainer competition. A pre-production T-7A, at rear, flies together with one of the T-X demonstrators, at front. USAF Christian Turner 'Procuring these PRTVs [Production Representative Test Vehicles] in FY25 also allows the Air Force and Boeing to improve manufacturing readiness prior to entering the production phase for the entire run of over 350 T-7As,' Andrew Hunter, then-Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, said in a statement on January 15. 'Decreasing overlap between development, testing, and production lowers the likelihood of potential costly retrofits of a significant number of aircraft.' All of this presents serious concerns for the Air Force's already strained pilot training pipelines. The T-7As are in line to replace the service's T-38 Talon jet trainers, the core design of which dates back to the 1960s and that are only becoming harder and harder to sustain. Problems with the T-7A program, for which Boeing has a fixed-price contract, have led to financial trouble for the company, as well. Earlier this month, Boeing announced that its Defense, Space & Security division had suffered another $500 million loss on T-7A tied, at least in part, to higher-than-expected costs associated with the planned start of production in 2026. The company has previously reported more than a billion dollars in losses on the program since winning the Air Force's T-X jet trainer competition in 2018. 'Air Education and Training Command is actively working with our acquisitions partners to develop cutting edge training capabilities at the speed of need,' Air Force Lt. Gen. Brian S. Robinson, head of the Air Force's top training command, said in January around the announcement of the Red Hawk program restructuring. 'The T-7A will propel the Air Force’s pilot training pipeline into the future of aviation, enabling the Air Force to continue producing world-class pilots who meet the challenges of the future.' No matter what the current state of the T-7A's emergency ejection system is or what other work has been done since the end of Fiscal Year 2024, more work is clearly still needed before pilot trainees can start using the Red Hawks to get their wings.

Airbus A321 Airliners To Be Modified Into 'Flying Frigate' Patrol...	Airbus Defense and Space has begun a risk-assessment study for France’s future maritime patrol aircraft (MPA), to be based on an Airbus A321 airliner platform. Billed as a 'flying frigate' by the company, the new MPA is intended to replace the French Navy’s Dassault Atlantique 2 fleet but emerges at a time when NATO nations are increasingly adopting the in-production Boeing P-8 Poseidon for their maritime patrol requirements. Airbus yesterday announced a contract for further risk-reduction studies of the new maritime patrol aircraft. The contract was awarded by the Direction Générale de l’Armement (DGA), France’s defense procurement agency, with Airbus Defense and Space as prime contractor, in partnership with European defense corporation Thales. The contract runs for two years and follows a previous architecture and feasibility study launched at the end of 2022. The new A321 MPA will be based on the long-range A321XLR version of the airliner. The prototype is seen here in Hamburg, Germany. MarcelX42/Wikimedia Commons The latest contract is intended to prepare for the full-scale development of a new MPA that could start at the end of 2026, followed by the production launch. It will involve the first wind tunnel tests as well as work out technical specifications, so the various onboard systems can be chosen. It will also look at the economic and industrial conditions involved in the program. Significantly, the latest study specifies a maritime patrol variant of the A321XLR airliner, known as the A321 MPA. The earlier study had looked at building an MPA version of either an unspecified version of the A320 family or the Dassault Falcon 10X business jet An earlier Airbus concept for a multi-mission A320neo family, including an AEW&#038;C version with conformal radar arrays, a SIGINT platform, and a VIP jet. Airbus While Airbus had considered the shorter A320neo as a potential platform for a new MPA, the longer fuselage of the A321 means that it can accommodate additional fuel and a larger payload bay, as well as having an increased capacity for sensors and other mission systems. The basic A321XLR airliner has a range of 4,700 nautical miles (around 5,400 miles). 'The A321 MPA has all the assets to become a true flying frigate capable of responding to the wide range of missions entrusted to the French maritime patrol,' said Jean-Brice Dumont, Executive Vice President, Head of Air Power at Airbus Defense and Space, in a company statement. 'Airbus offers a sovereign solution that provides the autonomy, availability, and reliability required to contribute to the oceanic component of the nuclear deterrence.' Interestingly, Dumont referred specifically to one of the current Atlantique 2’s missions, namely protecting the French Navy’s nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) fleet as it heads out on patrol, or returns to its base, as a cornerstone of France’s strategic deterrent. The French Navy SSBN Le Terrible heads out on a patrol. Wmeinhart/Wikimedia Commons Other missions outlined for the A321 MPA at this stage include anti-submarine and anti-ship warfare, 'from low to high intensity,' as well as intelligence gathering. The turboprop-powered Atlantique 2 in service today was originally developed with anti-submarine warfare as its primary mission, but subsequently increasingly took on an anti-surface warfare role against enemy warships. More recently, it’s been mainly used for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and even strike missions overland. Indeed, embracing operations overland, including taking part in counter-insurgency campaigns in the Middle East and in West Africa, has been the most remarkable change in the Atlantique 2’s mission profile. A French Navy Atlantique 2 MPA. Dassault Aviation At this stage, however, the A321 MPA is being developed primarily for the overwater role, reflecting the return to prominence of anti-submarine warfare, as well as maritime patrol more generally, especially to counter Russian activities, conventional or otherwise. The mission equipment for the A321 MPA will be provided, to a significant degree, by Thales, and will include an active electronically scanned array (AESA) search radar and acoustic systems, including passive and active sonobuoys, for anti-submarine warfare. Like the Atlantique 2, it will also have a magnetic anomaly detector for acquiring submerged submarines. It will be fitted with self-protection equipment and satellite communications and will almost certainly also feature electronic support measures (ESM) to intercept radio-frequency transmissions. Triangular-shaped fairings scabbed on the side of the A321 MPA in the artist’s rendering at the top of this story may well contain ESM. The same rendering of the A321 MPA also shows a sensor turret below the forward fuselage. After various upgrades, the Atlantique 2 has two separate sensor turrets: a forward-looking infrared (FLIR) camera under the nose and an MX-20 turret that contains four different cameras and is primarily employed during overland missions, including for ISR. The MX-20 sensor turret under the rear fuselage of an Atlantique 2. Dassault Aviation 'The aircraft’s large cargo bay and the open architecture of its mission system give it a great capacity to evolve throughout its lifecycle to meet the emergence of new threats,' Airbus says of the A321 MPA. The weapons for the A321 MPA will include anti-submarine torpedoes as well as anti-ship missiles, some of which will be carried in the bay behind the wing, although wing pylons will likely also be provided. In particular, the aircraft is expected to be armed with the new anti-ship missile that’s being developed under the Future Cruise/Anti-Ship Weapon (FC/ASW) program that is run jointly by France, the United Kingdom, and Italy. FC/ASW plans to field two different missiles: a low-observable cruise missile and a highly maneuverable supersonic missile. While the former will replace the Storm Shadow/SCALP air-launched cruise missiles, the latter will be the successor to the Exocet and Harpoon anti-ship missiles and will arm the A321 MPA. An artist’s concept of the two missiles in the FC/ASW program: a low-observable cruise missile below, and the highly maneuverable supersonic anti-ship missile above. MBDA The Anti-Ship Weapon component of FC/ASW is expected to be a ramjet-powered missile, which will be much faster and more agile than previous-generation Western air-launched anti-ship missiles. Although being optimized to engage heavily defended naval targets, it’s also expected to have a secondary defense-suppression capability and there have even been indications it could have an air-to-air role for use against high-value airborne assets (HVAAs) at long ranges. At the same time, there may be potential for the A321 MPA to be armed with the new land-attack missile, too. The potential of aircraft in this class to provide useful additional long-range strike capacity, especially in the context of adversaries’ anti-access capabilities, is something TWZ has considered in the past. Notably, Airbus also points to the A321 MPA having a 'high-maneuverability capability, including at low altitude.' This seems to point to traditional concerns around using jet-powered aircraft for the MPA mission, rather than their slower- and lower-flying turboprop brethren, which are more efficient in this regime. The same issue applies to the P-8, which was also planned to prosecute underwater targets from high altitude. Previously, the P-8 had to drop down to release a standard Mk 54 torpedo, but it has now added the High-Altitude Anti-Submarine Warfare Weapon Capability (HAAWC) folding-wing kit to the same weapon, meaning it can also launch them from higher levels. It’s not clear if a similar solution will be developed for the A321 MPA. An artist’s conception of a HAAWC-equipped Mk 54 torpedo. Boeing Current plans call for the MPA to replace the French Navy’s fleet of aging Atlantique 2s sometime in the 2030s or 2040s. Currently, the French Navy has 18 Atlantique 2s upgraded to the latest Standard 6 configuration and, in the past, the service has said it will retain these until 2035. They are stationed at Lann-Bihoué naval air base in northern France. As for the A321, this has, so far, seen limited uptake for special-mission military applications. At one time, the A321 was envisaged as the platform for NATO’s Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS) system, which provides the alliance with reconnaissance capabilities, including synthetic aperture radar. However, this capability was eventually fielded on NATO’s fleet of five RQ-4D Phoenix uncrewed aerial vehicles, specialized versions of the Global Hawk. Early concept artwork showing an A321 equipped with NATO’s Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS) system. NATO Since then, India has selected the A321 as the platform for its future airborne early warning and control aircraft, the Netra Mk 2. Originally, it appeared that A320s would be chosen for this program, as you can read about here, but New Delhi eventually settled on the stretched fuselage, longer-range A321, buying six former Air India airframes for conversion. Returning to the MPA mission, the A321 MPA continues the French tradition of locally developing aircraft to meet this requirement. Ultimately, France pursued the Atlantique 2 alone and the aircraft failed to secure any export orders. Should full-scale development and production of the A321 MPA follow as planned, the aircraft will enter a very competitive marketplace in which the U.S.-made P-8 Poseidon appears to have already secured most of the obvious orders. In terms of NATO forces alone, the P-8 has been ordered by Canada, Germany, Norway, and the United Kingdom, and close ally Australia has been operating the Poseidon for years now. The fact that the German Navy opted for the U.S. product is a particular blow for France, which had previously been working with Germany on a joint program to develop a new MPA — the Maritime Airborne Warfare System (MAWS). Only yesterday, the German Ministry of Defense published photos of its first P-8 taking shape with Boeing in Seattle. The first P-8A for the German Navy. Boeing The first P-8A for German Marineflieger received its paintjob in Seattle, WA. Deliveries for eight aircraft on order are to start in August this year. Via Bundeswehr WhatsApp-channel (sigh).&mdash; Alex Luck (@alxluck.bsky.social) 2025-02-04T15:27:14.715Z The P-8 has also been ordered by India, New Zealand, and South Korea further reducing the potential MPA market share for the A321 MPA, which looks like it will offer a very similar set of capabilities. Perhaps France might have better luck offering the A321 MPA to potential customers in the Middle East where it has traditionally had a strong footprint. Meanwhile, there is a growing demand for maritime surveillance in the Asia Pacific region, particularly around the South China Sea. This strategically important waterway links the Indian and Pacific Oceans and China claims large swathes of it, leading to frequent tensions and standoffs. Here, Chinese submarine activity is a particular concern, as you can read about here. While the A320 family has been an undoubted success as an airliner, it remains to be seen whether the A321 MPA will achieve positive results. However, unless France also decides to buy the P-8 — which seems politically highly unlikely — there are few other obvious options to replace its hard-worked Atlantique 2 fleet.

USS Gerald R. Ford Was Still Struggling With Its Dual Band Radar ...	The dual-band radar (DBR) aboard the Navy aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78), the ship's primary sensor system, struggled to perform during a pre-deployment exercise and suffered failures as it grappled with the constant need for radar coverage. It remains unclear whether DBR's issues impacted Ford’s operations during its first full deployment, which began in May 2023 and was extended before ending in January 2024, but the Navy is now seeking to replace Ford's DBR entirely. These findings are part of the Pentagon's Director Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) annual report released last week. The document contains revelations regarding what the Navy will need to do to continue using the DBR, which was only installed aboard Ford and a truncated version of it exists in the three ships of the USS Zumwalt (DDG-1000) class. The full DBR suite was supposed to equip these ships before being scaled back significantly a decade ago, mainly due to cost concerns. In addition to DBR, the latest DOT&E report also offers fresh insights into the state of the Navy’s newest carrier, how it performed during deployment and the potential for rough seas ahead. (USN) (U.S. Navy) 'DBR availability declined during the FY23 [composite training unit exercise] with the continuous demand for radar coverage and an intermittent failure observed during operations,' the report states. Service officials did not respond to TWZ questions on the report’s findings by deadline, and this article will be updated when those answers come in. Prior DOT&E reports have blamed subpar DBR performance on 'the operational expectation of continuous radar coverage.' Due to DBR only being installed on the Ford and a version of it and its combat system on three Zumwalt class ships, supporting DBR and its assorted maintenance, software and upgrades is a pricey proposition for the Navy, which is very heavily invested in the proven Aegis Combat System and associated sensors. The Navy is also considering replacing Zumwalt’s radar with a SPY-6 variant and Aegis Combat System to help with sustainment and commonality across the fleet. The DOT&E notes both DBR's rarity and the challenges the Ford may face in keeping it up and running as it awaits the installation of a variant of the AN/SPY-6 radar. A rendering of how an AN/SPY-6 radar variant would look on a Ford class aircraft carrier. (Video screenshot/RTX) The specific version of the SPY-6 destined to supplant the DBR on Ford is a subvariant of what is also known as the Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar (EASR) and will include three separate fixed antenna arrays installed around the carrier's island instead of the DBR's six arrays. All subsequent Ford class carriers will be built with EASR, leaving just Ford as the only carrier ever have fielded the DBR. TWZ has previously unpacked the capabilities of the complete SPY-6 family, which currently includes four different variants, and the potential payoffs of fielding such an advanced and scalable active electronically scanned array radar system across the fleet. In addition to Ford class carriers, the Navy plans to install versions of the radar onto various new surface combatants, carriers and amphibious ships going forward, and plans are underway to back-fit it into existing destroyers as well. The various variants of SPY-6 radars. (RTX) It remains unclear precisely when the Ford will get EASR and the new DOT&E report warns that relying on the DBR until then will be challenging. For now, the Navy has asked manufacturer Raytheon to continue providing engineering efforts in support of the DBR program, Military + Aerospace Electronics reported in November. Raytheon did not respond to a TWZ request for comment on its DBR efforts by deadline Tuesday. The DOT&E report's data cutoff date was Oct. 1, 2024, and it remains unclear what progress, if any, has been made on correcting the ship's issues, including problems with the DBR, since then. 'Due to the one-of-a-kind nature of the DBR, its availability will depend on the Navy’s access to replacement parts throughout the remaining life of the system,' the DOT&E report states. 'The Navy should acquire sufficient DBR replacement parts for the interim period prior to the scheduled replacement of DBR with EASR.' DBR was billed as the service's first radar system capable of operating simultaneously on the S-band and X-band frequency ranges. It combines the functionality of the X-band AN/SPY-3 multifunction radar and the S-band SPY-4 volume search radar (VSR) for detecting and tracking targets. It and its underlying combat system was billed central nervous system of the Ford class. Sailors at work on the deck of the USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) in October. (U.S. Navy) But citing costs and the fact that it might be more radar than a carrier needed, given the capabilities of carrier strike group (CSG) destroyers and cruisers, the Navy opted to replace DBR back in 2016 Military Aerospace + Electronics’s John Keller reported. Continued reliability issues and it having zero commonality with the rest of the fleet were also huge concerns. Cost was also a factor, and officials said that moving to the EASR for the Ford class’s second carrier, the future USS John F. Kennedy (CVN-79), would save the service up to $120 million. The future aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy (CVN-79) under construction in 2019. (U.S. Navy) Even with last year’s extended deployment under its belt, the Ford continues to suffer a host of other problems across various ship systems beyond the DBR. Insufficient data has been gathered to determine the carrier’s operational effectiveness due to initial operation and testing evaluations remaining incomplete, according to the DOT&E. In some ways, the tardiness of Ford’s testing is to be expected, according to Bradley Martin, a retired Navy surface warfare officer and senior policy analyst at the RAND think tank. 'Many things about the Ford are unusual, and a starting point is that it was delivered late,' Martin told TWZ. The Ford was delivered in 2017, after roughly 15 months of delays. Its first cruise was pushed back several years as well. 'It’s not exactly that the Navy’s operational needs scuppered the testing cycle as much as the ship being delivered late meant that the operational schedule had already been perturbed,' he said. TWZ has extensively covered the trials and tribulations of the Ford over the years, and the DOT&E’s new report provides added insight into the struggles the Navy has long faced in fixing problems like advanced weapons elevators (AWE), subpar sortie generation rates, and other issues. At one point lawmakers derided the ship as little more than 'a $13-billion nuclear-powered floating berthing barge.' TWZ has also covered Ford’s engineering advancements, from its new island design to a novel video system offering 360-degree situational awareness. While Ford has suffered a variety of missteps over the years, few ship failures have attracted more scrutiny than the AWEs. Billed as a next-generation breakthrough, it took the Navy roughly four years after accepting the Ford to make all 11 of its weapons elevators work. Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Mike Gilday watches USS Gerald R. Ford’s (CVN-78) advanced weapons elevators (AWE) during a visit to the ship in 2019. (U.S. Navy) The Navy reported to DOT&E that Ford’s weapons department conducted 11,369 AWE runs during its May 2023 to January 2024 deployment, moving more than 1.8 million pounds of ordnance to the flight deck. Still, the report notes that these rates fall short of what these AWEs are supposed to move. 'Of note, the crew is reliant on off-ship technical support for correction of hardware and software failures,' the report states. During its deployment, the Ford maintained fighter jet sortie generation rates 'that were sufficient to meet combatant commander operational taskings.' But during carrier qualifications and other evolutions, sortie generation rates have fallen short of the program requirements, a baseline that is not listed in the report. The DOT&E blames these shortfalls on continuing issues with the 'reliability and maintainability' of the carrier’s electromagnetic aircraft launch system (EMALS) and advanced arresting gear (AAG). Ford is the first carrier to feature a catapult system not powered by steam, and issues have plagued EMALS for years. The DOT&E report warns that problems with EMALS and AAG 'continue to adversely affect sortie generation and flight operations.' The report states that the EMALS catapult and AAG arresting gear system completed 8,725 launches and arrested landings during Ford’s deployment. DOT&E did note that it hasn’t received enough data from the Navy to update the reliability statistics laid out in last year’s report. A sailor performs a prelaunch inspection on an Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) on the flight deck of the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) in September. (U.S. Navy) It also warns of 'AAG reliability degraders,' and how challenges continue to exist when it comes to obtaining AAG replacement parts. The service continues to have to rely on 'off-ship technical support' to address AAG problems as well. The Navy is also considering whether it should retrofit a fourth AAG engine on the carrier class. It was originally incorporated into Ford’s design, but not installed 'as a cost savings measure,' the report states. 'The fourth engine would improve the reliability and availability of AAG, improve the pilot boarding rate, and restore a redundant capability to rig the barricade in the event of AAG engine failure, which the current configuration does not support,' the report states. When it comes to EMALS in particular, DOT&E noted that 'reliability has not appreciably changed from prior years and reliance on off-ship technical support remains a challenge. NAVAIR is continuing development on improvements.' Fiscal Year 2024 saw the Navy make improvements to how it collects EMALS reliability data, and a similar effort for the AAG is underway. But work remains to be done. 'The Navy has not yet shown progress for data collection on the other shipboard systems, but has implemented procedural changes designed to improve data collection within shipboard work centers in support of the FY25 scheduled test events,' the report states. Meanwhile, the sea service continues to update its test plan for areas like sortie generation rate, self-defense, and cyber survivability. The aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78), sails in formation with the Japan Maritime Self Defense Force (JMSDF) Kashima class training ship, JS Kashima (TV-3508), middle, and Hatakaze class guided missile destroyer JS Shimakaze (TV-3521) in the Atlantic Ocean in September. (U.S. Navy) Ford’s berthing for its crew and carrier air wing are also lacking, the DOT&E warns. TWZ has already reported on sailor quality-of-life issues like clogging toilets, and the new report indicates that sailors could be sardined together in ever-tighter quarters. The prospect of Ford being overcrowded runs counter to the carrier class’s original vision, which entailed design changes that would reduce manning to 15 percent below a Nimitz class carrier’s force of 3,000 sailors. An embarked carrier air wing brings a Nimitz class carrier to about 5,000 in all. New ships are supposed to feature growth allowances that would allow for an extra 10 percent of the ship’s company, allowing for extra racks for crew turnover, visitors, and personnel temporarily assigned to the vessel. 'However, sufficient berthing is not installed for the Ford class to conduct combat operations with all hands assigned a bed, due to a lack of berthing capacity for embarked units,' the DOT&E found. 'If the ship and its embarked units were each at 100 percent manning, the ship would have a shortfall of 159 beds. These berthing shortfalls will affect quality of life onboard and could reduce the Navy’s operational flexibility in employing the ship across its full spectrum of missions and logistical support roles for the CSG.' Such rack shortfalls could increase as the carrier’s air wing diversifies to host the CMV-22B Osprey, the MQ-25 Stingray aerial refueling drone, and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, none of which are currently part Ford's carrier air wing (CVW). The Stingray is not yet in service, and TWZ reported last month on other changes Navy brass has planned for CVWs. The Navy's MQ-25 Stingray aerial refueling drone. (U.S. Navy) Original test plan timelines for gauging other aspects of Ford were delayed due to 'the Navy’s operational requirements,' the report notes. The Navy and Pentagon faced a difficult choice with Ford. They could have waited for all the testing to be completed, or they could have sent it east from Norfolk as a contributing member of a carrier fleet that is already stretched thin, Martin noted. 'As of its deployment, it was capable of doing most of the things aircraft carriers need to do in the environment as it exists,' he said. 'Waiting for all those to be tested might have resulted in years of delay in getting the ship out to where it could take at least some of the pressure off the operational force.' 'Were all its systems tested to the point of readiness? No,' Martin said. 'Was the ship capable of doing the job of an aircraft carrier? Yes.' The next carrier in the Ford class, the future USS John F. Kennedy, is scheduled for delivery later this fiscal year and will be capable of supporting F-35 operations. The future USS Enterprise (CVN-80) is running 18 months behind its original delivery date and is scheduled to be delivered to the Navy in Fiscal 2029, according to the DOT&E. 'This delay is due to complications with material availability and industry/supply chain performance,' the report notes. The Navy will take possession of the future USS Doris Miller (CVN-81) in Fiscal 2032, according to the report. The following two Navy carriers, CVN-82 and CVN-83, will be named after presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, respectively. Ford’s first full cruise was an operational win for the Navy’s priciest and arguably one of its historically most troubled acquisitions programs. But the DOT&E report indicates that, at least up to the cutoff date for data available in the report, much work remained to be done on the Ford to ensure that it is the high-tech, capable power projector that it has been billed as since it's inception. Clearly, there has been some progress, but some of the ship's issues require major changes or physical additions, and those don't come quickly when it comes to massive warships.

Russia’s Modernized Nuclear Battlecruiser Finally Powers Up Its R...	The hugely delayed effort to return the Russian Navy’s nuclear-powered battlecruiser Admiral Nakhimov to service is finally yielding some tangible results, according to Russian reports. Russian state media states that the 28,000-ton battlecruiser’s two nuclear reactors are now online, with claims that the warship should go back to sea for trials starting this summer. It remains to be seen whether that timeline proves anywhere remotely accurate, with the warship’s return to service having been delayed multiple times in the past. 'Last Sunday, the second nuclear reactor was physically launched on the Admiral Nakhimov cruiser,' an unnamed source in Russia’s defense-industrial complex told the state-run TASS news agency. The same outlet reports that the warship’s first reactor went online at the end of December 2024. A July 20, 2024, satellite image from the berth at Sevmash shipyard shows the Admiral Nakhimov in the water, but with much work still to be done before it can start sea trials. Google Earth 'The consecutive physical launch of the cruiser’s two reactors demonstrates the readiness of the entire nuclear powerplant of the ship for operation in all modes,' TASS reported today, noting that the Admiral Nakhimov is currently in the Sevmash shipyard in the port city of Severodvinsk on the White Sea. First launched in 1986, the Admiral Nakhimov is part of the class of warships known in Russia as the Project 11442, which is codenamed Kirov class by NATO. In its modernized form, the battlecruiser has the revised designation Project 11442M. Admiral Nakhimov, which was originally named Kalinin, photographed in around 1991, just three years after being commissioned into service. DoD For years, the Admiral Nakhimov was in dry dock undergoing a deep refit, with the original promise being that the warship would eventually emerge as basically new, with a whole range of new weapons and sensors. While those ambitions have been scaled back, adding another Kirov class vessel to the Russian Navy would be a powerful statement, both in terms of capabilities and, more significantly, prestige. Currently, the Russian Navy operates a single Kirov class battlecruiser, the Pyotr Veliky (Peter the Great), which serves with the Northern Fleet having undergone only minor modernization. As a result, it still relies primarily on its Soviet-era weapons and sensors. At one time, it was planned that the Pyotr Veliky would undergo the same in-depth rework as the Admiral Nakhimov, once the work on the latter had been completed. The status of those plans is now very uncertain, with reports that the Russian Navy may retire the battlecruiser altogether and concentrate on the Admiral Ushakov. #NavalNews SEVMASH shipyard continues upgrading the Project 11442/Kirov class heavy nuclear-powered missile cruiser Admiral Nakhimov (ex. Kalinin) to Project 11442M mod. I wonder when (and if) this decades long upgrade saga will end.Video released in November 2022 by SEVMASH. pic.twitter.com/T2zqFxDaNn&mdash; Saturnax (@Saturnax1) December 12, 2022 Two earlier hulls, the Admiral Ushakov and the Admiral Lazarev have been out of service for many years and have since been consigned to scrap. While there have been many interruptions to the effort to get the Admiral Nakhimov back to operational status — not least the turmoil as a result of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine — it should be recalled that this was never going to be a straightforward undertaking. The Admiral Nakhimov seen in the the Sevmash shipyard in 2017, totally stripped and with a green and red base coat applied. YouTube screencap After all, the Admiral Nakhimov had sat idle for over a decade in the frigid White Sea, with work only really starting to progress in 2014. Since then, the planned delivery date has also been pushed back repeatedly. Originally the project was going to be completed around 2018. Then it was pushed back to 2019, and then 2020. As of 2017, TASS was reporting that work on the battlecruiser should be completed by 2021. Then, in 2021, it was reported that the warship wouldn’t return to service before 2023, while in 2022 the Sevmash shipyard stated that service re-entry had now been pushed back to 2024. It’s certainly not the case that the shipyard has been idle, however. Previous images from Severodvinsk have shown huge portions of the warship entirely gutted, with the expectation that they will accommodate new weapons and sensors. The ambition of thoroughly remodeling the battlecruiser has certainly been evident, although it remains to be seen exactly how thorough this has been, once the warship finally goes back to sea. The Admiral Nakhimov surrounded by scaffolding, in the the Sevmash shipyard in 2017. YouTube screencap Originally, the refit was set to provide the Admiral Nakhimov with no fewer than 174 vertical launch tubes — which would provide it with more than any other surface combatant or submarine in the world. Plans called for 80 of these tubes to accommodate various modern Russian cruise missiles, including the subsonic Kalibr, the supersonic Oniks, and supposedly the hypersonic Zircon. The former location of the Granit (SS-N-19 Shipwreck) missile farm in the hull of the Admiral Nakhimov during its refit. Now, vertical launch cells should fill the space where 20 angled Granit launch tubes were previously found. YouTube screencap As far as Russia has claimed, Zircon has to date only been deployed on Russian Navy Admiral Gorshkov class frigates, although there is compelling evidence that the missile has also been combat tested in Ukraine. Previously, there were public announcements that the Kirov class would be the first operational launch platform for the hypersonic weapon, although any such plans would have been superseded by the delays with the modernization of the Admiral Nakhimov. Meanwhile, for air defense, other tubes would reportedly be filled with surface-to-air missiles associated with the S-300FM Fort system, derived from the land-based S-300 system. While these were part of the previous armament, they would have been bolstered by eight Pantsir-M combined gun/missile systems for short-range air defense. Other reports in the past have suggested that missiles from the land-based S-400 air defense system may be incorporated, as a further evolution of the S-300FM, which would provide a more robust anti-ballistic missile capability. Alongside these new weapons, the Admiral Nakhimov was at one time set to have almost every item of combat-related equipment replaced with more modern successors as part of a wide-ranging systems overhaul. A video gives some idea as to how extensive the work on the Admiral Nakhimov has been (starts at 4:45): If the Admiral Nakhimov does emerge with the promised full set of new weapons and sensors — and that’s a big question — it will provide the Russian Navy with its most powerful surface combatant. The modernized warship — together with the less-capable Pyotr Veliky — will then be available as the centerpieces of Russian flotillas. Their value will be greater since the prospect of the aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov returning to service — at least, any time soon — remains unclear. With the Russian Defense Ministry meanwhile prioritizing the war in Ukraine, as well as modernization of the strategic arsenal, the Russian Navy may well consider itself lucky to be able to put a major surface combatant into service, albeit a reworked one. This is especially relevant since plans to develop a new class of ‘super-destroyer’ have long since been shelved, with current construction programs focusing on more modest frigates and corvettes, as well as new-generation submarines. A model of the Project 23560 Lider class nuclear-powered destroyer, work on which appears to have been suspended indefinitely. Artem Tkachenko via Wikimedia It’s worth noting that the Kirov class represents the last nuclear-powered surface combatant in service anywhere in the world, with the U.S. Navy having retired the last of its nuclear-powered cruisers in the 1990s, primarily on cost grounds. Once again, whatever the final configuration of the Admiral Nakhimov once it returns to service, this impressive warship will be a very significant symbol of Russian naval power and one that could potentially serve for many more years to come.

RC-135 Rivet Joint Surveillance Jet Just Flew Unprecedented Missi...	A U.S. Air Force RC-135V Rivet Joint conducted a highly unusual flight in the Gulf of California between Mexico's Baja Peninsula and the rest of that country yesterday, according to online flight tracking data. The strategic intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) plane looks to have done the same today. The Rivet Joint is one of America's most capable intelligence-gathering assets and the appearance of one off the Mexican coast is a significant development. This comes amid a major increase in U.S. military support to operations along the border with Mexico under President Donald Trump and talk of unprecedented direct action by American forces against drug cartels, which you can read more about in this separate TWZ feature. Flight tracking software shows RC-135V serial number 64-14845 flew southwest from Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska to the skies over southern California on February 3. Offutt is home to the 55th Wing, which oversees the bulk of the Air Force's Rivet Joint fleet along with an array of other ISR and highly specialized command and control aircraft. The jet then hooked south along the Pacific coast of the Baja Peninsula before flying up into the Gulf of California. The aircraft subsequently returned to Offutt following the same route, but in reverse. USAF RC-135V Rivet Joint operating in the Gulf of California.

Screen captures from ADS-B Exchange showing RC-135V serial number 64-14845 as it was tracked on January 3 (at left) and January 4 (at right).

So, about that RC-135 flight today&#8230;&#8230; Fair warning, this'll be a longer one.Yes, I watched as 64-14845 launched out of Offutt this morning and headed toward the Pacific for today's mission.

There are no indications that 64-14845 ever entered Mexican national airspace in the course of any of these flights. When queried about 64-14845's activity off the coast of Mexico, the U.S. Air Force redirected TWZ to U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM). We have also reached out to the Mexican Embassy in Washington, D.C. A stock picture of an RC-135V/W Rivet Joint. USAF It is worth noting up front that the use of RC-135V/W Rivet Joints to support operations in the Western Hemisphere, especially counter-drug missions, is not necessarily well known, but is also not new, something TWZ has highlighted in the past. Rivet Joints flying sorties tasked to NORTHCOM, specifically, is something that occurs on a somewhat regular basis, as well.

From there, 64-14845 could listen into the northwestern corner of Mexico, an area that largely falls under the influence of the infamous Sinaloa Cartel. Whose boss?

The aircraft can also geolocate and categorize the emitters sending out those signals, from radios to radars. On a typical mission, an RC-135V/W's crew consists of more than two dozen individuals, which includes linguists, electronic warfare officers, and other intelligence specialists who can immediately begin analyzing the information the SIGINT suites collect. The Rivet Joint also has an extensive communications array that allows data to be passed in near real-time to nearby units in the field and/or to nodes globally for further exploitation and dissemination. An Air Force briefing slide offering a breakdown of a typical Rivet Joint crew. The note at the bottom refers to the plane’s ability to perform 'processing, exploitation, and dissemination,' or PED, of intelligence data on board and then send that information along in near-real time. USAF Intercepting and geolocating communications chatter, together with other intelligence, can help establish so-called 'patterns of life' for a select individual or group of individuals. That information, in turn, can be used to help further refine intelligence gathering strategies or even plan and execute targeted ground raids or strikes. Similarly, data provided by Rivet Joints can also help in the creation of what are known as electronic orders of battle detailing the disposition of enemy or potentially hostile forces, especially air defense units and command and control nodes, in a given area. However, this is not applicable to the flights off the coast of Mexico. Rivet Joint flights in the Gulf of California could provide a valuable additional stream of intelligence on cartels operations and other illicit activities, as well as just better situational awareness about what is happening in a critical cartel activity area. That would be in line with official statements from the Pentagon about its expanded presence around the southern border since President Trump took office in January. 'We anticipate that overall, on the southwest border, [active-duty personnel] will provide real-time situational awareness of persons, vehicles, vessels and aircraft; and they'll work with [U.S. Customs and Border Protection] on operator-level maintenance, movement and staging of [CBP] assets,' a senior U.S. military official said last month. 'We also anticipate that there could be some additional airborne intelligence, surveillance, and support assets that would move down to the border to increase situational awareness.' USNI News reported yesterday that U.S. Navy P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol planes are now conducting flights along the border with Mexico as another example of increased U.S. military ISR support. P-8As also have extensive SIGINT capabilities, as well as turrets with electro-optical and infrared video cameras. US Navy personnel assigned to Patrol Squadron 40 (VP-40) onboard a P-8A during a flight along the southern border on January 31, 2025. USN Petty Officer 2nd Class Andy Anderson Intelligence that RC-135V/Ws, as well as other ISR aircraft, collect could be passed along to other U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies, including to support interdiction operations on land and at sea. The U.S. military has an established history already of providing near real-time information from aerial surveillance platforms about suspected drug smuggling and other illicit activities to law enforcement agencies along the border, as TWZ has explored in detail in the past. Certain intelligence might also be passed to authorities in Mexico to support their counter-drug and other operations. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum pledged to deploy 10,000 troops on her country's side of the border to help combat drug trafficking yesterday as part of an ostensible deal to try to stave off a trade war with the United States. Sheinbaum's predecessor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, had similarly agreed to send 10,000 troops to the border back in 2021 as part of an earlier agreement struck with former President Biden's administration. The appearance of a Rivet Joint in the Gulf of California also comes amid open discussion about the possibility of the U.S. military taking direct action against drug cartels in Mexico, including targeted strikes. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said in an interview on Fox last Friday that 'all options will be on the table,' but added that any such decision to act would rest with President Trump. Pete Hegseth on possible military strikes in Mexico: 'All options will be on the table.' pic.twitter.com/O2nxPYoksG&mdash; Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) January 31, 2025 The capabilities that the Air Force's RC-135V/Ws offer mean its presence could be a precursor to such an operational intent, dramatically increasing the quality and volume of available intelligence collection. Rivet Joints are used regularly in this general role in the lead-up to larger operations. As just one example, Rivet Joints flew regularly off the coast of Syria in the lead-up to U.S.-led missile strikes on multiple targets in that country in April 2018 during President Turmp's first term in office. At the same time, they RC-135V/Ws are also used to collect regular intelligence from a standoff distance all over the world. So, it is important to stress that there are no indications at the time of writing that any such direct military activity is imminent or even planned. In addition, even if the flights were conducted with the explicit approval of the Mexican government, pursuing that course of action would have far-reaching ramifications. TWZ has published a feature just today exploring these issues, which you can find here. Still, openly conducting Rivet Joint sorties in the Gulf California, together with the rest of the expanding U.S. military presence around the southern border, does already send broader signals to Mexico's cartels across the region.

Pentagon Still Unsure About Lethality Of Dark Eagle Hypersonic Mi...	The U.S. Department of Defense has disclosed that it’s still unclear about the lethal effects of the hypersonic missile that’s at the center of the Army’s Dark Eagle Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW) and which will arm the Navy’s Zumwalt class stealth destroyers and future Block V Virginia class submarines. The surprising knowledge gap comes after the Army achieved the long-delayed first test-firing of a Dark Eagle missile from its trailer-based launcher, something you can read more about here. The latest updates on the progress of the in-development Dark Eagle are provided by the Office of the Director, Operational Test & Evaluation, in its latest Annual Report. An M983A4 tractor truck towing a Dark Eagle launcher trailer. U.S. Army The report outlines the test program for the Dark Eagle in FY24, which began in the first quarter with an Army/Navy risk-reduction campaign, followed in the third quarter by integrated launch sequence testing, intended to iron out problems encountered in earlier flight tests. In the past, the Army had specifically pointed to issues with the launcher for causing significant delays in the planned fielding of the weapon system. In 2023 alone, the Army scrubbed three planned launches. The third quarter of FY24 also saw a successful launch of the Navy’s prototype All-Up-Round (AUR) — the actual missile component for the Army’s Dark Eagle and the Navy’s Intermediate-Range Conventional Prompt Strike (IRCPS) program, but that made use of a different ground-based launch apparatus. In the final quarter of FY24, the Army planned to conduct a missile test from a prototype transporter-erector-launcher (TEL), but this was shelved. A photo from the successful test launch of the common AUR in the third quarter of FY24. DOD Finally, in December 2024, there was a successful test launch from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, as TWZ reported at the time, although this is outside the scope of the latest report. This was the second successful end-to-end flight test of the AUR in the course of 2024, but was the first live-fire event involving the missile as well as a battery operations center (BOC) and TEL. Here is one of my iPhone videos of the LRHW test launch from Cape Canaveral this morning. pic.twitter.com/ZCKF3lTEuU&mdash; JohnCn (@JConcilus) December 12, 2024 As we’ve discussed in the past, the Dark Eagle is a prototype surface-to-surface long-range strategic fires system, which consists of one TEL and two Navy-designed AURs that are loaded in Army AUR canisters (known as AUR+C). In its initial form, each Army battery will have four TELs, each with two AUR+C, plus a BOC. A slide from an earlier Navy briefing providing a visual overview of the Intermediate-Range Conventional Prompt Strike (IRCPS) program and related systems, including elements of the Army’s Dark Eagle/LRHW effort. U.S. Navy Looking at the AUR specifically, this comprises two main components: a two-stage rocket booster with an unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicle, known as the Common Hypersonic Glide Body, on top. Under the CPS program, the same AUR will be launched from canisters on the Zumwalt class and the Block V Virginia class. A graphic giving a general breakdown of the common missile for the Dark Eagle/LRHW and IRCPS systems, as well as the division of labor between the Army and the Navy. GAO The two-stage rocket brings the conical ‘glide vehicle’ to an optimal speed and altitude before releasing it, after which it glides down to its target at hypersonic speeds, defined as anything above Mach 5, and along a relatively shallow, atmospheric flight path, maneuvering erratically along the way. The Army has previously said the weapon’s peak speed is at least Mach 17 and its maximum range is in excess of 1,725 miles. A close-up look at the common missile fired during the first successful test involving the Dark Eagle launcher. DOD Returning to the test program, what’s especially notable is that it has so far yielded insufficient data 'to evaluate the operational effectiveness, lethality, suitability, and survivability of the LRHW system,' the report states. Essentially, although it has been test-fired, the Pentagon is not able to 'make an adequate determination of AUR lethality,' noting that 'uncertainty in weaponeering tools could result in excessive employment requirements or failure to meet warfighter objectives.' In this context, excessive employment refers to multiple examples of the missile being required to destroy certain targets. This would be a significant drawback, especially given the limited number of missiles in each Dark Eagle battery not to mention the huge costs of hypersonic weapons. A U.S. Army infographic showing the basic components of the LRHW, as well as a notional firing battery. U.S. Army In the meantime, the Navy has tested the warhead for the AUR, but independent of the missile. An arena test for the warhead was carried out in the first quarter of FY24, followed by a sled test in the second quarter of FY24. The Pentagon says that this sled test 'included some threat-representative targets,' but also notes that results are still being processed. Earlier sled and flight tests 'did not include operationally representative targets and consequently provided no direct validation of the weapon’s lethal effects,' the Pentagon adds. While the Director, Operational Test & Evaluation (DOT&E) was due to provide an independent assessment of the operational effectiveness and lethality of the missile based on the FY24 tests, it’s notable that the Navy is also looking at other methods to obtain effectiveness and lethality data, by using representative targets in future flight tests. One of the first Dark Eagle launchers delivered to the U.S. Army, loaded with an inert missile canister. U.S. Army As well as lingering questions about the lethality of the missile, there is also still a lack of data about the weapon’s own survivability, the Pentagon says. 'The Army has not yet evaluated the effects of a full-spectrum (kinetic, non-kinetic, electromagnetic, cyber) threat-contested environment on the performance of the AUR, TEL, or BOC,' the report states. As of the end of FY24, there had been no end-to-end cyber survivability testing, something that’s required to better understand potential vulnerability and to better assess its likelihood of defeating a defended target. For a missile that’s meant to defeat high-value and time-sensitive targets, this would seem to be a glaring omission. In the meantime, the report adds, the Army is relying on the Navy’s data gathered via modeling and simulation, component testing, and hardware-in-the-loop evaluations to better evaluate the AUR’s full-spectrum survivability. For the future, the DOT&E report outlines the requirements for the evaluation of operational effectiveness, lethality, suitability, and survivability, as follows: 'The test strategy should include the following considerations: a concept of employment consistent with the expected operational and threat environment; an operational demonstration that includes strategic-level mission planning; test and evaluation in a full-spectrum contested environment, including representative targets; and validated modeling and simulation, combined with ground and subscale test data…' Another view of a Dark Eagle launcher. U.S. Army Ultimately, the Army 'needs to incorporate representative targets and environments into flight tests and other live lethality and survivability tests,' this portion of the report concludes. While it’s to be expected that the lethal effects of a new missile system won’t be known until the requisite end-to-end testing has been completed in an operationally realistic environment, somewhat more surprising is the relatively compressed timescale the program is otherwise working to. The Army plans to complete the rapid fielding of the Dark Eagle under a so-called Middle Tier of Acquisition (MTA) effort by FY27. This calls for the fielding of two additional batteries. These will follow the initial Dark Eagle unit — Battery B, 5th Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery (Long Range Fires Battalion), part of the 1st Multi-Domain Task Force (MDTF) — that has already been activated at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington State. Last month, we got our first look at the four new launch tubes for hypersonic missiles installed on the USS Zumwalt. The other two ships in the Zumwalt class are also set to get the same array of tubes. At the same time, the ships are losing at least one of their 155mm Advanced Gun Systems (AGS), the advanced ammunition that the Navy previously determined would be too expensive to buy. A slide from a presentation at the 2025 Surface Navy Association symposium, which also details the timeline for installing the new launch tubes onto the USS Zumwalt. U.S. Navy Should the next phase of tests reveal that the lethal effects of the hypersonic missile, or its survivability fall short of what is required, that leaves precious little time to make modifications — provided that is even possible. At the same time, the importance of the Dark Eagle and Intermediate-Range Conventional Prompt Strike within the Pentagon’s strategic fires portfolio is only increasing. Following the apparent cancellation of the U.S. Air Force’s AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW) program in 2023, it appeared that Dark Eagle would become the U.S. military’s first operational novel hypersonic weapon. At this stage, there’s still some uncertainty surrounding ARRW status and there could still be plans for a follow-on effort. An AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW) under the wing of a B-52H.

This picture was taken ahead of the last publicly known planned live-fire test, which occcured the following month. USAF Regardless, the U.S. military is now doubling down on developing and fielding hypersonic boost-glide vehicle weapons, as well as air-breathing hypersonic cruise missiles. With a growing focus on the potential future high-end conflict in the Pacific against China, these kinds of weapons are seen as critical to successfully prosecute a range of targets both on land and at sea. Also, America's most capable adversaries have already fielded similar systems, at least to a degree, putting the U.S. in the position of playing catchup. Meanwhile, increasing tensions between Russia and NATO have resulted in plans for 'episodic deployments' of ground-based hypersonic and other long-range missile systems to Europe. With their combination of speed, maneuverability, and altitude, hypersonic missiles should offer a highly survivable means of rapidly defeating time-critical, heavily defended targets. That remains the goal of Dark Eagle and the Navy’s Intermediate-Range Conventional Prompt Strike program. Based on the currently available test data, however, the Pentagon will have to wait a little longer to confirm whether the novel missile used in these systems fully meets these aspirations.

How Trump Could Use Military Force Against Cartels In Mexico	President Donald Trump, who has frequently suggested he might use U.S. military force against the cartels in Mexico, currently has options to do so. However, even with the new executive order he signed designating cartels as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTO), Trump would still face several legal and policy hurdles, as well as geopolitical considerations, before he could broaden the scope of any actions across the border, according to former military, intelligence and government officials we spoke with. Such a move would be unprecedented - the U.S. military has never directly attacked cartels in Mexico, some of those former officials told us. The most recent indication of Trump administration's intentions came last week when Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was asked if he would use the military to combat cartels. 'All options will be on the table if we're dealing with what are designated to be foreign terrorist organizations who are specifically targeting Americans on our border,' he told Fox News. Hegseth did not provide any specifics because he didn’t want to get ahead of Trump on the issue. The president has yet to publicly divulge his plans. Pete Hegseth on possible military strikes in Mexico: 'All options will be on the table.' pic.twitter.com/GJ548lc9fl&mdash; AlexandruC4 (@AlexandruC4) January 31, 2025 However, a number of actions have to take place before we see anything like the scene depicted in the 1994 movie Clear and Present Danger, in which a U.S. Navy F/A-18 Hornet carries out a missile strike on a Colombian cartel leader. 'Presidents - and especially this President - assert very broad power to use force unilaterally, at least up to a certain level, without congressional authorization' under Article II of the U.S. Constitution, Matthew C. Waxman, Liviu Librescu Professor of Law at Columbia University, told us. 'The claim is generally that as commander in chief and chief executive, the president has power to military force to defend the United States.' A direct attack by cartels north of the border would give Trump the widest latitude for responding with military force inside Mexico, Javed Ali, who worked in the National Security Council’s (NSC) counterterrorism unit during the first Trump administration, told us on Monday. There is already reported chatter about that, with claims that cartels are discussing using weaponized drones against U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CPB) and law enforcement personnel along the border. In addition to spurring Trump to invoke Article II, such an attack would allow him to respond under United Nations Article 51’s self-defense provisions, noted Ali, now an associate professor of practice at the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan teaching courses on counterterrorism and domestic terrorism, cybersecurity, and national security law and policy. Trump could also invoke the War Powers Act, which would give him 60 days to carry out military operations before seeking Congressional approval, Ali explained. Meanwhile, the new executive order on cartels, which has yet to be enacted, would not greatly open the aperture on U.S. military actions in Mexico, Waxman stated. That executive order is one of several Trump signed to deal with the problems of drugs, unchecked immigration, and human trafficking. After signing an executive order designating Mexican cartels as Foreign Terrorist Organizations, Trump says he could send U.S. Special Forces into Mexico to liquidate the cartels.Claudia Sheinbaum won’t be happy hearing that… pic.twitter.com/ruTK1cddHm&mdash; Visegrád 24 (@visegrad24) January 21, 2025 'Designating cartels as FTOs has some legal effects and some political ones,' said Waxman, who served in senior positions at the State Department, Department of Defense, and National Security Council during the George W. Bush administration. As a National Security Council aide, he was involved in the White House response to the attacks on September 11, 2001. 'Legally, [the executive order] triggers a range of criminal law enforcement and immigration authorities, as well as financial measures, that can be used to squeeze them and cut off support for them. Politically, it can help elevate their threat by treating them like other grave national security threats, and thereby lay some groundwork for future actions. However, FTO designations do not directly trigger authorities to use military force.' The designation, for instance, would not automatically give Trump the ability to carry out special operations forces raids against cartels akin to the U.S. Navy SEAL Team 6 Operation Neptune Spear mission that killed Osama Bin Laden in Pakistan on May 1, 2011. However, there is an existing law that could make such an action against cartels possible. President Barack Obama invoked Title 50, the U.S. law permitting a president to carry out clandestine operations in foreign countries, to justify that operation. Osama Bin Laden's compound in Pakistan raided by U.S. Navy SEALS. AFP PHOTO/ AAMIR QURESHI (Photo credit should read AAMIR QURESHI/AFP via Getty Images) AAMIR QURESHI 'Every president has a powerful tool under Title 50 in which military operations could be approved and conducted against a priority U.S. target in a foreign country, but without the consultation or coordination of the foreign government in which the target is located,' explained Ali. 'It's possible that the president could authorize and notify to the congressional intelligence committees a covert action program against the cartels,' under Title 50, Waxman noted. 'I don't know if Trump or a previous president has done so, or what the parameters are of such a covert action program. The intelligence oversight statutes allow the president quite broad authority to initiate covert action programs, subject to certain special procedures and reporting requirements.' There are other precedents for using force against terror groups on foreign soil. U.S. drone strikes like those that killed ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi in 2019, the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps leader Qassem Soleimani in 2020, and the airstrike carried out last week against ISIS leaders in Somalia were all conducted against terror groups. You can see the latest attack in the following video. pic.twitter.com/PK1V8YklhY&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2025 However, those actions were justified under the Authorization for the Use of Military Forces (AUMF) against Islamic terror organizations enacted in the wake of Al-Qaeda’s 2001 attack on New York and Washington D.C. The 2001 AUMF was enacted to allow then-President George W. Bush to go after that operation's planners and those who aided and harbored them. Another AUMF was authorized in 2002 to give Bush the authority to invade Iraq and subsequent administrations used it to justify actions against Islamic terror groups around the world. At present, cartels are not considered to be directly connected in a significant scale to these Islamic terror groups. Should Trump want to launch an airstrike, a special operations forces raid or even a wider military strategy against cartels in Mexico, he would likely need a new AUMF specifically tailored for those organizations, Ali posited. Waxman, however, had a different take, suggesting that Trump would not need a new AUMF to go after cartels, but might want one 'to make his legal arguments stronger.' Either way, a cartel-designated AUMF is something that has been considered before. In a piece he co-authored for Lawfare, Waxman noted that in 2023, some Republican House members introduced an AUMF against fentanyl-trafficking cartels. Current U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz was one of the co-sponsors when he was in Congress. The measure never passed. West Coast-based Naval Special Warfare (NSW) operators prepare to enter a building while conducting nighttime direct action raid training at Fort Irwin. (DoD) Petty Officer 2nd Class Charles Propert While a Title 50 operation in Mexico would not require an AUMF, such a mission would likely be a one-off, Ali suggested. 'Using the 2011 [Bin Laden] raid as an example, given the risky cross-border nature of that kind of operation, the U.S. would probably only do that once under Title 50 versus a new AUMF from Congress that would authorize a longer pattern of military operations similar to the campaign against AQ and the Taliban in Afghanistan or against ISIS in Iraq and Syria in the mid-2010s,' stated Ali. There is another option at Trump’s disposal. CIA Special Operations Group (SOG) teams could conceivably target cartel personnel. 'This would require a presidential finding and compliance with covert action oversight laws, and because assassinations are barred by an executive order, the CIA would need to argue that this is not a political killing but is something else,' Waxman explained.

(Photo by Shaul Schwarz/Edit by Getty Images) Shaul Schwarz Regardless of whether he followed required authorizations or not, Trump’s first option would likely be airstrikes — with drones and/or standoff weapons being the most likely option — for several reasons. As we have previously reported, Mexico’s increasingly well-armed drug cartels pose a serious threat to external forces. Some cartel units are extremely well-equipped and have adopted some of the latest features of warfare. They have been using drones to attack enemies for years now, for instance. This is terrifying. Video released by the Mexican cartel and paramilitary group CJNG show the extent of militarization of their special forces.

Cartels can also have defacto control over large areas with lots of support at the ready. Inner circles around key drug lords are among the most heavily defended and fortified positions in these areas, which makes them challenging targets. But the same 'find and fix' tactics that have been used to take out terrorists in the Middle East, especially with the help of drones, could potentially be brought to bear to help solve that problem. Unless Mexico agrees to their employment, they would not be operating in totally permissible airspace. While Mexico's air defenses are extremely rudimentary, this could still be an issue. Any sort of ground raid without prior authority from Mexico raises the concern that any U.S. troops inadvertently left behind or otherwise captured could be without legal protection. That’s why U.S. military deployments frequently take place with Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs) giving military personnel and civilian contractors protection from being subject to unfair criminal or civil justice systems. 'This is important not only to protect the rights of U.S. service members and to vindicate the United States’ interest in exercising disciplinary jurisdiction over U.S. uniformed personnel, but also because U.S. willingness to deploy forces overseas – and public support for such deployments – could suffer significant setbacks if U.S. personnel were at risk of being tried in an inherently unfair system, or at any rate, in one that departs fundamentally from U.S. concepts of basic procedural fairness,' according to the U.S. State Department. While far less risky to U.S. troops, the downside of relying solely on airpower is the loss of valuable intelligence U.S. forces could gather on the ground to rapidly exploit, as they did in Afghanistan and Iraq. MQ-9 Reapers were America's weapon of choice when it comes to finding and targeting nefarious actors during the Global War on Terror. Many of those same lessons learned could apply to a fight against the Cartels, but there are hurdles to such a plan, as well. (USAF) Either way, whether an airstrike or a raid, the U.S. directly attacking the cartel in its own bastion would be a huge escalation and could spark and wider, sustained crescendo of hostilities, especially along the U.S.-Mexico border. Even cartel reprisal actions inside the U.S. are possible. Beyond direct military action, designating FTOs as terror organizations would also not necessarily increase the ability to collect intelligence against them, a former senior U.S. intelligence official told The War Zone. 'As long as they're not a U.S. person, you can collect on all you want,' said the former official, speaking on condition of anonymity. 'Drug traffickers would certainly fall into that category.' In one example of that underway already, a U.S. Air Force RC-135V/W Rivet Joint surveillance jet on Monday was spotted by an online flight-tracking site executing an unprecedented set of mission through the narrow Gulf of California. This is directly adjacent to notorious cartel hotspots. The use of U.S. military surveillance aircraft in the counter-narcotics role is far from new, but placing one of America’s most capable strategic aerial collection platforms right in the Mexican cartels’ backyard certainly is.

That does not seem to be forthcoming from the Mexican government at this point. This would be another complicating factor for any assault, even if a one-off operation, as it could end up with the Mexican military confronting U.S. soldiers if things go deeply awry. Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum recently said that Trump’s executive order would only be applicable if there’s close coordination between the two governments, The Associated Press reported. Mexico would defend its sovereignty and independence while seeking coordination with the U.S. in the wake of the order, she stated on Monday. 'We all want to fight the drug cartels,' Sheinbaum said at her daily press briefing. The U.S. 'in their territory, us in our territory.' A member of the National Guard in Bavispe, Sonora State, Mexico, on January 12, 2020, (Photo by Alfredo ESTRELLA / AFP) (Photo by ALFREDO ESTRELLA/AFP via Getty Images) ALFREDO ESTRELLA A retired special forces officer we spoke with noted that there have been times in the past when the U.S. was kicked out of a country by its leadership. He pointed to Bolivia as one example. 'If you don't have the host nation backing, it will get bad,' he said. 'We had a situation with [then president] Evo Morales in Bolivia. He was upset and asked the DEA to leave. We had traditionally sent two SF teams there since 1986. We had a good relationship with them.' While there is a lot of conjecture about what could take place, the U.S. military has a long history of efforts to counter cartels in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America. These have been advise and assist missions to help host nations conducted by the U.S. Army Special Forces, better known as Green Berets. As part of their Foreign Internal Defense (FID) mission, Green Berets help host nations fight cartels without taking direct action themselves. These missions have traditionally fallen to the 7th Special Forces Group, the experts we spoke with explained. That’s because that group, headquartered at Eglin Air Force Base in the Florida panhandle, has Latin America as its area of responsibility and many members are fluent in Spanish and knowledgeable about the region and its customs. Special Forces Operational Detachment Alpha, 7th Special Forces (Airborne), executes a Demo and live fire exercise at Camp 'Bull' Simons , Fla., June 29, 2023. The exercise keeps SFODA’s current on training in order to execute missions across the globe. (DoD) 'They would be the right guys,' said the retired SOF officer, who spent a dozen years assigned to the U.S.-led Plan Colombia. That was the counterinsurgency/counternarcotics fight against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), a guerilla group heavily involved in the drug trade that undermined security and the rule of law in Colombia and across Latin America. 'During the Plan Colombia period that I participated in from 1999 to 2011, the 7th Special Forces trained the 3,500-man Colombian Army Counterdrug Brigade, the 600-man Junglas (Police Airmobile Antinarcotics Unit), the Colombian Army special forces units: the Lancero Battalion and the Commando Battalion,' said the expert. 'They organized the instructor cadre for the Police Mobile Carabinero Squadrons (80 x 120-man police units that operate in rural areas), and they trained the 80-man national unit, the AFEU.'

(U.S. Army Special Forces) The expert foresees similar efforts with Mexico's special military and law enforcement units who take the lead in the fight against cartels. They also noted that these are law enforcement missions, and these special units are employed when greater force, advanced military skills, and special equipment are needed to provide the decisive edge in confronting the heavily armed cartels. He laid out several steps that have already been taken. 'US Special Operations Forces (Army, Navy, Marines) can train Mexico’s special military and police units in operations planning and execution,' he stated. SOF liaison officers, known as LNOS, 'are assigned to the Embassy Working Group. They meet with the Mexican special units to assist in planning and provide the US Embassy with situational awareness.' 'All of these missions (border and Mexico) have been done by the U.S. military in the past,' he explained. 'They can be implemented quickly and with no foreign or domestic controversy.'

(Photo credit should read YURI CORTEZ/AFP via Getty Images) YURI CORTEZ The chances of Trump ordering some sort of unilateral action against the cartels in Mexico may have somewhat diminished as of yesterday. He reached a deal with Mexico to delay the imposition of a 25% tariff on goods imported from there over what he perceived as that government’s unwillingness to stop the flow of drugs and people across the border. Meanwhile, Sheinbaum announced a series of steps she is taking. 'We had a good conversation with President Trump with great respect for our relationship and sovereignty,' she stated on X. '&#8230;Mexico will immediately reinforce the northern border with 10,000 members of the National Guard to prevent drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States, particularly fentanyl' while 'The United States is committed to working to prevent the trafficking of high-powered weapons to Mexico.' Both nations, she added, 'will begin working today on two fronts: security and trade.' Sostuvimos una buena conversación con el presidente Trump con mucho respeto a nuestra relación y la soberanía; llegamos a una serie de acuerdos:1.México reforzará la frontera norte con 10 mil elementos de la Guardia Nacional de forma inmediata, para evitar el tráfico de drogas…&mdash; Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo (@Claudiashein) February 3, 2025 While this moment of detente may seem encouraging, and the results could help slow the flow of drugs and human trafficking across the border further, the cartels remain. Strangling their cash flow, which can often lead to turf wars amongst themselves, certainly is a critical aspect to any fight against them. But if Trump really plans on going after the cartels directly, it will take more than that, and what that could look like remains to be seen. But clearly, he does have options.

VH-92 Patriot Fully Taking Over Marine One Duties Has Slipped To ...	The U.S. Marine Corps transition to the VH-92A Patriot as its only helicopter for use in the 'Marine One' role shuttling the president, the vice president, their families, and their closest advisors around at home and abroad, is still underway and now we know it won't be done till 2030, at the earliest. That is seven years later than the last plan for the VH-92's ascendency laid out. Aging VH-3Ds currently used for the mission are set to be retired completely next year. However, the service does expect to keep flying its VH-60Ns through at least 2030 because of their particular ability to operate in hot and/or high-altitude environments. The existing plan that was disclosed in 2021, declared that the Marines would divested all of the VH-3Ds and VH-60Ns by 2023. One of HMX-1's VH-60N helicopters. US Army New information about the Marine Corps presidential helicopter fleets, all of which are assigned to Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), are contained in a new Aviation Plan the service released today. A VH-3D assigned to HMX-1. USMC The 2025 Aviation Plan does not say how many VH-3Ds or VH-60Ns are still in service currently. As of 2022, when the Corps put out its last public Aviation Plan, HMX-1 had 11 VH-3Ds and eight VH-60Ns. The U.S. Navy, in cooperation with the Marines, accepted the delivery of the 23rd and final VH-92 in August 2024. Former President Joe Biden became the first American head of state to fly on one of the Patriots that same month. Then President Joe Biden disembarks from a VH-92A in Chicago in August 2024, the first time one of the helicopters had been used in the Marine One role. BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images 'The U.S. Marine Corps declared initial operational capability for the VH-92A in December 2021 and HMX-1 began its introduction into operational missions in 2022 following White House commissioning events,' according to the 2025 Aviation Plan. 'HMX-1 currently has 10 VH-92As to support mission tasking,' it adds. 'Once fully transitioned and divested of legacy aircraft, HMX-1 will operate 16 VH-92As.' Two of the 23 VH-92As are known to be dedicated test aircraft. If HMX-1 is ultimately expected to operate just 16 of the helicopters, it is unclear what will happen to the remaining five airframes. TWZ has reached out to the Marine Corps for more information. Regardless, 'HMX-1 is currently conducting an in-stride transition from legacy VH-3D and VH-60N aircraft to the VH-92A,' per the new aviation plan. 'Both [the VH-3D and VH-60N] aircraft have been through a Service Life Extension Program and have sufficient hours to support the mission through full transition to the VH-92A. Aircraft will be retired as they reach airframe hours limits and as the VH-92A takes on more of the mission. VH-3D aircraft are anticipated to continue serving through 2026. Due to their unique capabilities in high/hot environments, the VH-60N aircraft are anticipated to continue serving through 2030 before being fully retired.' A VH-60N parked on the ground with a VH-92A flying in the background. USMC Very hot temperatures and/or high altitudes degrade the performance of helicopters, in general, potentially to a dangerous degree. Types that offer particularly good hot-and-high performance therefore provide clear advantages in those environments over ones that don't. In line with this, VH-60Ns have been regularly seen over the years supporting presidential visits to relevant locales, including Afghanistan, Somalia, and even the Swiss Alps, among many others. The retention of at least a portion of the VH-60N fleet through 2030 specifically for its hot-and-high performance does raise questions about whether the VH-92 will be able to sufficiently meet that need in the future if the new helicopters cannot adequately do so now. 'No major upgrades are currently planned for either [the VH-3D or VH-60N] aircraft,' the 2025 Aviation Plan notes. 'However, minor communications upgrades may be necessary to ensure the remaining legacy aircraft are operationally relevant until the squadron has completely transitioned to the VH-92A.' Communications systems issues were one of the hurdles the VH-92A itself had overcome on its long road to reaching operational service. Sikorsky won a rebooted competition to replace the VH-3D and VH-60N in 2014. That followed the cancellation of plans to acquire the Lockheed Martin VH-71 Kestrel, a derivative of the Anglo-Italian AW101 from AgustaWestland (since subsumed into Leonardo), due to delays and cost growth. Lockheed Martin has since acquired Sikorsky. The first VH-71 prototype seen arriving at Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland in 2005. USN Other issues beyond extremely reliable and secure communications, a critical requisite for the Marine One mission, held up the operational employment of the VH-92A. This notably included the helicopter's exhaust system scorching the White House lawn. Whether changes have been made to the exhaust system to rectify or mitigate that particular problem is unclear. 'The VCD [verification of correction of deficiencies] operational test conducted in FY24 found that 30 open deficiencies had been adequately corrected, 1 has been mitigated through changes to the standard operating procedures, and 1 is no longer applicable due to a WHMO [White House Military Office] policy change regarding the system design,' according to the most recent annual report on the VH-92 program from the Pentagon's Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E), which was released last Friday. DOT&E did not provide specific details about the deficiencies that were addressed. The course does now seem increasingly clear for the VH-92A to take over as Marine One. At the same time, while the VH-3Ds are not scheduled to head off into retirement next year, the VH-60Ns, with their hot-and-high capabilities, have years of service still ahead of them.

Imaging Infrared Seeker For APKWS Guided Rockets Is In The Works	Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II, better known simply as APKWS, is slated to be demonstrated with a passive infrared seeker. The news came in the 2025 Marine Aviation Plan, which states that 'Additional demonstrations are also in [the] work[s] with the Army and Air Force to determine [the] feasibility of adding additional guidance methods to the APKWS family, including passive infrared seekers.' While little is known about this initiative, such a capability could potentially offer a far cheaper solution with independent targeting capabilities compared to existing missiles, while also increasing magazine depth on certain platforms dramatically. BAE Systems' APKWS takes 70mm Hydra unguided air-to-ground rockets with various warhead configurations and fits them with a small laser guidance section between the motor and the warhead. The employment concept is simple, put the laser on the target and fire the rocket within its engagement parameters and it will fly to that target with incredible precision and detonate. They can take out individuals in doorways and vehicles rushing across a roadway, for instance. They also do this at a fraction of the cost of traditional missiles, coming in at around $15,000 to $20,000 apiece for the guidance kit and a few grand more for the warhead and rocket motor. This is compared to hundreds of thousands of dollars, or more, for traditional missiles. An infographic showing the current warheads and motors that are compatible with the APKWS due to its modular design. The GD OTS HEAT/APAM warheads have yet to be added to the list. Credit: BAE Systems APKWS guidance sections with the four laser seekers arranged one on each fin. (BAE Systems) Since its introduction into service, APKWS has evolved in a snowballing manner. Now, as any sort of cost-per-shot ratio advantages are top of mind in the Pentagon, the precision-guided rockets are seen as a cheap way to take out targets on the ground and, increasingly, in the air, as well. This has led to APKWS' adaptation into a surface-to-air effector, which has seen great success in Ukraine, and now as an air-to-air weapon in its own right. Footage of a Russian Shahed-136/Geran-2 attack drone being shot down with an APKWS laser-guided rocket launched from the Vampire C-UAS system, operated by Ukraine. pic.twitter.com/Lv3NxYjDL0&mdash; Status-6 (Military & Conflict News) (BlueSky too) (@Archer83Able) July 21, 2024 Just last week, TWZ broke the news that USAF F-16s have been swatting down Houthi drones and cruise missiles with APKWS, which marked the operationalizing of a capability first demonstrated in 2019, but that has not been discussed publicly since. For an F-16, a seven-shot pod of the rockets more than doubles its air-to-air missile magazine depth while just occupying a single pylon. Still, there are real limitations to APKWS in the anti-air role, whether fired from the ground or the air. It is generally usable against slower-flying drones and some cruise missiles, both of which are largely non-reactionary, non-hard-maneuvering targets. They also require the target to be lased (laser-designated) throughout the rocket's flight. In other words, this is not a 'fire-and-forget' weapon, it needs to have its target illuminated until the warhead detonates. This limits the rapidity of multiple engagements and, especially for air-to-air applications, makes engagements tricky. For the latter, having one aircraft lasing and one firing would help with these limitations, especially considering that the rocket has limited range and speed, and the firing aircraft has to clear any blast fragmentation area quickly in order to not be struck by its own weapon's effects. Footage of Ukrainian naval forces downing a Russian Shahed-131/136 attack drone over Odesa. pic.twitter.com/WzIh4wHN0l&mdash; OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) February 11, 2024 What would make these engagements far easier is if the APKWS rocket was equipped with its own infrared seeker, something we have mentioned before. This would allow it to lock on before launch and fly to its target autonomously. This means multiple targets could be engaged far faster and, in many cases, in a safer manner. It also means that radar could be used to help initially acquire the target and point the seeker at it prior to firing, both in ground and air-based applications. Think of it as firing a cheaper, shorter-range AIM-9 Sidewinder missile that has a use case not against other high-performance, hard-turning fighters, but for engaging drones and cruise missiles, which mainly fly in straight lines or maneuver at slower speeds and lower g-rates. Costs could be cut by providing a simplified, staring imaging infrared seeker, potentially using commercially available off-the-shelf components. It would not need the range and counter-counter-measure capabilities of the AIM-9X, nor its high-off boresight capabilities. It is also possible that an infrared seeker could be pursued for use in air-to-ground or surface-to-surface applications, as well. This would allow for targets to be engaged passively, without the use of a laser, which can be detected, and is another potential failure point and complication in the targeting process. It would also allow for vehicles to employ the rockets without a laser designator. How exactly an imaging infrared seeker would be fitted into the APKWS is unclear as the small laser seekers are mounted on the forward fins that are part of the guidance section. Maybe small, very basic infrared sensors could be mounted similarly, but it's more likely that putting single seeker in the traditional spot, on the nose, would be the solution, although it may increase expense and limit modularity. In fact, a similar seeker system was already built and tested by the Navy a decade and a half ago. Low-Cost Imaging Terminal Seeker (LCITS) focused on engaging surface targets, especially swarming small boats. So it's not like this hasn't been done before and imaging infrared sensor technology has come a long way in the last 15 years. LCITS ended up becoming something of a joint U.S.-South Korean program that continued development through to today under the Low-cost Guided Imaging Rocket (LOGIR) program primarily intended as a coastal defense system. You can read more about this here. The U.S. could adopt a version of LOGIR system and even work to apply it in the counter-air role, or at least adapt technology it has gleaned from it to APKWS. The bottom line here is that this could be a huge boost, especially in the anti-air role, for APKWS at a time when exactly this kind of cheaper, more plentiful solution is so badly needed to counter drones and lower-end cruise missiles. But even in the surface-to-surface and air-to-surface role alone it could be an exciting development. We will let you know more about the initiative if we hear back from BAE Systems.

Navy HELIOS Laser Aboard USS Preble Zaps Drone In Latest Test	The Navy has disclosed that the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Preble successfully test-fired its High-Energy Laser with Integrated Optical Dazzler and Surveillance (HELIOS) system to take out an aerial target drone in Fiscal Year 2024. It was the latest major demonstration of the surface fleet's shipboard laser ambitions, even as other U.S. military laser efforts have faced a reality check in recent years. Preble's drone zapping was 'to verify and validate the functionality, performance and capability' of HELIOS, and this latest step toward moving shipboard lasers into a fully operational state was revealed in the Pentagon’s annual Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOTE) report that was released Friday night. Little else was disclosed in the DOTE report regarding where and when Preble, a Flight IIA Arleigh Burke subvariant, fired its laser. The warship shifted homeports from San Diego to Japan in September, just a few days before the end of FY24. TWZ has reached out to the Navy for more information on the test and where HELIOS currently stands, and this report will be updated when that information comes in.

(Lockheed Martin) Either way, it’s a capability that Navy brass has been increasingly clamoring for, especially in the past year, as Navy warships shoot down an at-times daily barrage of drones and missiles fired by Iran-backed Houthi rebels over the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. Those battles and other global flashpoints have raised continued concerns about the Navy draining its finite missile stocks, as the pacing threat of China looms on the horizon. TWZ has reported on several aspects of the Navy’s battle against the Houthis, including a tally of ordnance expended during more than 400 engagements against the Houthi arsenal of aerial drones, anti-ship cruise missiles, and anti-ship ballistic missiles. 'When I was in Bahrain as [the Destroyer Squadron 50 commanding officer] 10 years ago, the afloat staging base USS Ponce had a laser on it,' Naval Surfaces Forces commander Vice Adm. Brendan McLane told reporters in early 2024, before the Surface Navy Association conference. 'We’re 10 years down the road, and we still don’t have something we can field?' Indeed, the 60-kilowatt HELIOS and other long-promised directed-energy weapons have been a long time coming for the surface fleet. As TWZ previously reported, it was first spotted aboard Preble in 2022. Its debut predates the Houthi fight, but is the type of system that would seem primed to help, at least to a limited degree, ease missile expenditures during similar operations. The High-Energy Laser with Integrated Optical Dazzler and Surveillance (HELIOS) laser directed energy weapon installed on the Navy destroyer USS Preble, with an inset showing a rendering of the system. (U.S. Navy/Lockheed Martin) TWZ’s past reporting on HELIOS points to why it would be so useful for taking out drone attacks and disabling or destroying small boats. both manned and unmanned, with nefarious intent. It can also serve as a 'dazzler' to blind or confuse optical seekers on incoming missiles and drones. The dazzler can limit an opponent’s general situational awareness by denying their sensors the ability to surveil the ship. HELIOS also sports its own optical sensors, which can serve a secondary intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) role. On Preble, HELIOS sits on the warship’s main forward pedestal that hosted the Mk 15 Phalanx Close-In Weapons System (CIWS) on earlier Arleigh Burke class destroyer variants. Flight IIA destroyers currently have only one CIWS installed above the hangar bay. Outside of the handful of destroyers modified to the ‘Rota configuration,’ which feature SeaRAM and Phalanx, Flight I Arleigh Burkes feature two CIWS, front and rear. The Phalanx Close-In Weapons System (CIWS). (U.S. Navy) Lockheed Martin received its first contract from the Navy for work on HELIOS in 2018, but the system builds on a much longer history of directed energy research and development at the company. The system is particularly powerful when paired with the Aegis Combat System. Rich Calabrese, Director of Surface Navy Mission Systems for Lockheed Martin, expounded on HELIOS and Aegis during a broader interview with The War Zone in 2021: 'We’re continuously upgrading the multi-source integration infusion capability of the Aegis weapon system and looking to bring in new weapons and sensors and do coordinated hard kill and soft kill. Directed energy weapons… We’re really already integrating the HELIOS Laser Weapon System with the Aegis Weapon System CSL [Common Source Library] in our lab here in New Jersey. In fact, we’ve… The guy who’s now managing the laser program… He let me know the other day that we recently fired a laser here under the control of the Aegis Weapon System computer program. So, we’re building in the capability to do that weapon coordination and to do the hard kill, soft kill coordination in an automated fashion working with the HELIOS Weapon System.' The HELIOS laser system sits on a pedestal in front of the USS Preble's bridge. (U.S. Navy) Petty Officer 2nd Class Malcolm Kelley Lockheed Martin is contracted to deliver at least one more HELIOS system for an Arleigh Burke. Company officials said they designed the system with future capability growth in mind as well, including increasing the system’s maximum power up to 150 kilowatts. Such a power level would allow HELIOS to more rapidly down smaller drones at longer ranges and take on bigger and more complex threats, such as anti-ship cruise missiles and even enemy aircraft, albeit still at relatively shorter distances. The Navy and Lockheed Martin demonstrated the ability of a solid-state laser directed energy weapon to successfully shoot down a target drone acting as a surrogate for a subsonic cruise missile in 2022, using a weapon called the Laser Layered Defense (LLD) system during a test at the U.S. Army’s White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. HELIOS constitutes one facet of the Navy’s directed energy ambitions, which are now set to eventually include high-power microwave-based systems as well. Fellow destroyers, including the USS Dewey and USS Stockdale, are now equipped with the less powerful Optical Dazzling Interdictor, Navy (ODIN). Unlike HELIOS, ODIN’s laser can only be used as a dazzler, but it also has secondary surveillance capabilities. In late 2021, the year before HELIOS debuted aboard the Preble, the San Antonio class amphibious transport dock ship USS Portland engaged a static surface target with its laser directed energy weapon in the Gulf of Aden. That system, known as the Laser Weapon System Demonstrator Mk 2 Mod 0, was placed aboard Portland in late 2019, which The War Zone was first to report, and subsequently used to knock down a small drone in a demonstration in the Pacific Ocean in 2020. All told, the Pentagon is spending an average of $1 billion annually to develop such weapons for ships, aircraft and ground vehicles, Navy Times reported last year. But figuring out how to develop, procure and field such technology has proven challenging, according to a 2023 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report. The Navy amphibious transport dock USS Portland uses a laser to strike a static surface target in 2021. (U.S. Navy) The Defense Department has struggled to get 'these technologies out of the lab and into the field' for a number of reasons, including difficulty in determining how the force would use them during missions, according to the federal watchdog. 'Without early transition planning and drafting transition agreements, the Navy risks developing technology that is misaligned with operational needs,' the report warned. The realities of actually deploying and sustaining advanced laser weapons in the field, and just how effective they can be at this time, are also becoming clearer. These revelations have led to the DoD stepping back from some key, long-touted, laser weapons programs recently. The U.S. Air Force scrapped plans to flight test a laser directed energy weapon on an AC-130J Ghostrider gunship. (U.S. Air Force) Generally, laser weapon systems are chronically over-hyped, especially in the mainstream media, compared to what they can realistically achieve. Laser weapons can only engage one target at a time and they need to dwell on that target steadily for a prolonged period to have an effect, especially lower power-class examples that are fielded today. They also have power and thermal limitations which impact how many shots they can fire back-to-back. Their range is limited and impacted by atmospheric conditions and their components are delicate and hardening them for hash military use is an ongoing process. So, even in a naval sense, while they still are a very attractive capability, they are for low-volume point defense cases against very limited target sets for the foreseeable future. The Navy destroyer USS Preble arrives at its new homeport in Yokosuka, Japan, in October. (U.S. Navy) Those realities haven't stopped Navy brass from continuing to hammer the need for shipboard lasers. U.S. Fleet Forces Command head Adm. Daryl Caudle lamented the glacial pace of laser development at last month's Surface Navy Association annual symposium, Breaking Defense's Justin Katz reported. 'There’s been many a thesis and dissertation written on building lasers on ships, but we’ve not transitioned that into a place where that’s an acceptable way to actually take out missile systems,' Katz quoted Caudle as saying. 'These things are based on renewable energy, so I can recharge the system … I don’t have to worry about payload [or] volume with directed energy. All those things are appealing to a navy, [but] we just haven’t really matriculated that into a place … that’s ready for prime time,' Caudle continued. Even as the Navy proceeds with shipboard laser programs like HELIOS, the timing as to when they will actually become a widespread and robust capability remains unclear. Still, recent events are likely to only increase pressure to make shipboard laser weapons a commonplace reality within the U.S. Navy.

F/A-18’s Infrared Search And Track System Has 'Significant Reliab...	The U.S. Navy’s podded Infrared Search And Track System, or IRST, planned for its F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighters, has 'demonstrated significant reliability problems during operational testing,' according to the Pentagon. The ASG-34A(V)1 IRST Block II, seen as a key part of the Navy’s ability to retain its air-to-air advantage over potential adversaries, was first flown on a Super Hornet in late 2019 and TWZ had previously reported on delays caused by production quality issues with the system. The Office of the Director, Operational Test & Evaluation, in its latest Annual Report, provides an update on the status of the IRST Block II pod, which completed operational testing in the fourth quarter of FY24. These tests involved Infrared Optimized Configuration (IROC) pods, described as 'operationally equivalent' but designated for flight test. A Lockheed Martin infographic showing different applications for its IRST2 1 sensor, including the podded version for the Navy F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. Lockheed Martin While finishing up operational testing is a significant milestone, it’s tempered by the fact that, according to the report, 'operational test events were adversely affected by IRST Block II system reliability failures.' Data analysis is ongoing. As we have discussed before, including with the Super Hornet program manager, the centerline-mounted F/A-18E/F IRST pod provides the aircraft with a long-wave infrared sensor — the Lockheed Martin-developed IRST21 — that can search, detect, and track airborne targets. Very importantly, it is an ideal tool for detecting stealthy targets, which are proliferating. The IRST sensor assembly is installed in the front portion of a redesigned FPU-13/A centerline fuel tank. A conceptual diagram of how the IRST sensor is mounted in the fuel tank for the Super Hornet. Lockheed Martin Very importantly, the IRST pod provides an entirely passive capability, relying exclusively on the infrared spectrum to detect and track airborne targets, including those at far beyond visual range. With no radio-frequency emissions, the target won’t be alerted to the fact that they’ve been detected and are being tracked. At the same time, the IRST does not give away the location and presence of the host platform. This kind of sensor also provides a vital companion to the Super Hornet’s AN/APG-79 radar, functions of which may well be compromised in a heavy electronic attack or radar-denied environment. At the same time, the IRST Block II pod still contains fuel to extend the Super Hornet’s range, although this is trimmed from 480 gallons to 340 gallons once the sensor is fitted. In terms of the timeline for the system, developmental testing was conducted during FY23 and FY24, followed by initial operational test and evaluation (IOT&E) between April and September 2024, with the IROC pods, in support of full-rate production. In the meantime, however, earlier iterations of the pod had already been deployed on operations, carried by Super Hornets in the Middle East, with photos emerging of this in late 2020.

U.S. Air Force photo by Staff Sgt. James Merriman Staff Sgt. James Merriman When it comes to the suitability of the pod for full operational fielding, the report provides the following comments: In an operational context, the report notes that the IRST pod is seen as a complementary sensor to the AN/APG-79 'to support the guidance of beyond-visual-range air-to-air missiles,' either operating autonomously or in combination with other sensors. The missiles mentioned are the AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) and the AIM-9X Sidewinder Block II. 'IRST Block II demonstrated significant reliability problems during operational testing. Throughout the test period, IRST Block II suffered from hardware and software deficiencies, which required the aircrew to restart the pod multiple times. Troubleshooting and repair often exceeded the abilities of Navy maintenance crews and required assistance from Lockheed Martin. Many of these problems were discovered during integrated and operational test after the Navy completed a minimal developmental test program with the representative hardware. Additional details will be provided in DOT&E’s classified IOT&E report.' Despite these problems, the report notes that the test events were 'adequate to provide an assessment of the long-range detection and tracking capability, suitability, and cyber survivability' of the pod. Specifically, test events saw the pod being used against 'operationally relevant targets' at 'tactically relevant detection ranges.' Here, the pod demonstrated that it could translate long-range target detections into stable system tracks that would be suitable for weapons employment. The Lockheed Martin IRST21 sensor, as used in the Navy Super Hornet IRST pod. Lockheed Martin However, there is clearly still work to be done, with the report adding that the Navy 'must continue to improve the F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet’s operating software and address existing deficiencies to effectively integrate IRST into aircraft fire control solutions.' The Pentagon hopes that the Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) pods, which were planned to be delivered starting in September 2024 'may have increased reliability' and will 'improve lethality and survivability in air superiority missions against advanced threats.' As well as the reliability deficiencies outlined in this latest report, the Pentagon also notes that more work needs to be done to address IRST Block II and Super Hornet operating software deficiencies that had been recommended in the last such document, in FY23. Previous issues with the pod were also highlighted by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), in its 2023 Report to Congressional Committees. This earlier report noted that 'between 20 and 30 percent of the manufactured components [in the IRST pod] failed to meet performance specifications due to microelectronics issues.' These problems persisted more than four years after limited manufacturing had begun and served to delay the launch of developmental and operational testing. The 2023 report also highlighted the fact that 'staffing challenges' at a critical software development contractor were also leading to holdups in the program.

James Merriman Staff Sgt. James Merriman In the past, we have looked extensively at the advantages the IRST Block II pod will bring to the Super Hornet community and the Navy’s tactical aviation branch as a whole. The key arguments in favor of the Navy introducing an IRST capability on its Super Hornets are worth recalling. In particular, with China identified as the ‘pacing’ military threat, such capabilities will be fundamental to any future conflict in the Pacific theater. China is making rapid developments in stealth technology and advanced electronic warfare, two areas that make the introduction of an IRST sensor all the more compelling. These kinds of infrared sensors are immune to radar-evading stealth technology and are not affected by electromagnetic jamming and other electronic attacks. The Chinese diamond-shaped, stealthy, heavy tactical combat aircraft design, tentatively known as the J-36, which surprisingly appeared late last year. via X As well as being used as a targeting sensor, an IRST can also considerably enhance the flight crew’s situational air-to-air ‘picture’ in conjunction with more traditional sensors. The delays and problems with the Navy’s IRST pod are all the more alarming considering that the Air Force has already put equivalent sensors on its F-15Cs and F-16Cs. It should be noted, however, that the reliability of the Air Force’s IRST pods isn’t entirely clear at this point. The Legion IRST pod on a U.S. Air Force F-16: Even the contractor-operated adversary community is increasingly flying fast jets with IRST sensors. This is before we come to potential adversaries, such as China and Russia, which operate tactical fighters such as the Su-35 and Su-30 Flanker series that incorporate IRST sensors as standard. The Navy will be hoping that problems with its IRST pod are overcome sooner rather than later, as there’s little doubt that a system of this kind is now badly needed.

Escalating Trade War Raises Questions Over Canada’s F-35 Future	With Canada and the United States now locked in a rapidly escalating trade war, questions are being asked about the effect this could have on Ottawa’s plans to buy the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, as well as how the broader program could be impacted, bearing in mind the not inconsiderable involvement of Canadian industry. Looking first at the background to the trade war, U.S. President Donald Trump announced last week a 25 percent levy on Canadian and Mexican imports to the United States (as well as an additional 10 percent on China). Almost all goods will be affected, with Trump citing his concerns about illegal immigration and drug trafficking as the basis for the move. At the same time, Trump has also lambasted trade imbalances and unfair trade practices as major drivers behind this policy. U.S. President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on January 31, 2025. On this occasion, Trump spoke to reporters about tariffs against China, Canada, and Mexico. Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla In response, Canada announced its own retaliatory tariffs against the United States, putting a 25 percent levy on a range of U.S. goods. 'We don’t want to be here, we didn’t ask for this,' Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said. He added that he would 'not back down in standing up for Canadians,' while warning that the tariffs would impact people’s lives on both sides of the border. To give an idea of the deeply interconnected nature of the economies of the three North American countries, around $2 billion worth of manufactured goods are estimated to cross their borders each day. Trump has said he’s willing to increase the duties further if the countries in question retaliate to his tariffs, as Canada has done. What’s unclear at this point is whether the tariffs will affect the F-35 — as well as a raft of other military items that are sold between the United States and Canada. There have already been suggestions, however, that Canada might want to look elsewhere for its new fighters, in a snub to the United States. The future of Canada’s P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft procurement has also been questioned. An artist’s concept of a P-8A Poseidon in Canadian colors. Boeing In a comment provided to TWZ, Russell Goemaere, Public Affairs Officer at the F-35 Joint Program Office said: 'At this time, we are assessing impacts of any tariffs and will work with the government and our industry partners on the way forward.' When asked this weekend about the prospects of a rethink on of the acquisitions of the F-35 and P-8, David Eby, the premier of British Columbia, said: 'The prime minister will speak for the national approach… For major defense expenditures, which I know is a priority for the Americans, for the president, he wants to see Canada putting additional money into defense, well, we are all happy to do that work together, but these tariffs will force Canada into procuring from other countries.' But an exit route from the F-35 program will be far easier said than done for Canada. Canada finalized a deal with the U.S. government and Lockheed Martin for the procurement of 88 F-35As in January 2023, with the expectation that these would start to be delivered in 2026. You can read our report from March 2022 on Canada’s original selection of the F-35 to replace its fleet of aging CF-18 Hornets, as part of the Future Fighter Capability Project, here. Infographic outlining the key features of Canada’s future F-35As. RCAF The finalization of the deal appeared to bring to an end a long and fraught procurement process. Back in 2010, Canada’s Conservative government announced plans to buy 65 F-35As. Then, once Trudeau’s Liberal Party took power in 2015, an F-35 buy looked to have been ruled out. Amid very public criticism of the choice of the Joint Strike Fighter, Trudeau also made a pre-election promise that he would not purchase the F-35 if he was elected. For a while, it seemed that the F-35 was excluded from the Future Fighter Capability Project and plans were drawn up to buy a smaller number of F/A-18E/F Super Hornets as 'interim' fighter jets instead. At that point, an earlier trade dispute between the Canadian government and Boeing led to the F/A-18E/F being kicked out of the competition in December 2021. By this stage, the only other contender in the competition was Saab’s Gripen E, which the Swedish company had offered to build in Canada, in an effort to secure support for its bid. Saab Gripen E. Saab Two other European candidates, the Eurofighter Typhoon, and the Dassault Rafale, both left the competition before it had begun, complaining that the process unfairly favored U.S. companies. Finally, in March 2022, the F-35 was announced as Ottawa’s preferred selection. The Canadian government has said it expects to invest $19 billion in the F-35 project, a figure that has steadily climbed (in March 2022 the estimate was put at between $12 billion and $15 billion). Canada has been a part of @thef35 program from the very beginning.Today, we're honoured to share the official selection of the #F35 and mark a new era of partnership and prosperity with Canadians as the program strengthens opportunities for continued economic growth.&mdash; Lockheed Martin Canada (@LMCanadaNews) January 9, 2023 While the first F-35 for Canada is not scheduled to be handed over until next year, Ottawa has already invested heavily in the program. At the time that the Future Fighter Capability Project was launched in 2017, Canada had long been paying into the F-35 program as an industrial partner. Canada has been a member of the F-35 program from the very start, initially as a Level 3 industrial partner, without a firm commitment to buy any actual aircraft. Indeed, between 1997 and 2021, Canadian investment in the Joint Strike Fighter amounted to $613 million. All this helped Canadian firms secure dozens of contracts related to the F-35’s development and production. By 2019, these contracts had already brought a combined total of more than $1.3 billion into the Canadian economy. Furthermore, Canadian companies are eligible to bid on F-35-related contracts throughout the service life of the aircraft. Lockheed Martin Ultimately, it was this major industrial stake in the F-35 that meant the stealth fighter was also expected to be the front-runner in any formal competition in Canada. It’s a dynamic, which, in turn, makes it singularly difficult for Canada to extract itself from the F-35 program. However, there is a precedent. Turkey, which also had a significant industrial stake in the Joint Strike Fighter, found itself removed from the program over its refusal to give up a planned purchase of Russian-made S-400 air defense systems. Canada has already made significant investments in new infrastructure to accommodate the F-35, including the construction of fighter squadron facilities at 3 Wing in Bagotville, Quebec, and 4 Wing in Cold Lake, Alberta. This, taken together with industrial aspects, as well a major need for the aircraft makes it seem unlikely that Ottawa will scrap its plans to buy F-35s, despite previous flip-flopping on the issue. No other aircraft available today offers the same package of capabilities as the F-35, either. Last week, in a post on LinkedIn, the Canadian Association of Defense and Security Industries (CADSI) warned that 'any U.S. tariffs applied to Canadian defense exports would have a significant negative impact on our members, and on the highly integrated Canada-U.S. defense industrial base.' A U.S. Air Force F-35A performs during the 2023 Abbotsford International Airshow in British Columbia, Canada, on August 12, 2023. Photo by Liang Sen/Xinhua via Getty Images Xinhua News Agency More than a hundred Canadian companies provide components for the F-35, with one of them — the Ottawa-based Gastops — being a sole-source supplier, responsible for Oil Debris Monitor (ODM) engine sensors. This means that Gastops products are found in every single F-35 that is built. Other Canadian manufacturers supply F-35 components, on a non-sole-source basis that include wing bulkheads, keel beams, horizontal tails, landing gear, circuit cards, electro-hydraulic actuation systems, weapons bay door inserts, power and thermal management system controllers, and more. Ultimately, the F-35 is just one example of a U.S. defense program that Canada benefits from in terms of defense exports, which will not be hit by the new tariffs. There are many more such programs. Canada does not provide metrics for military exports to the U.S. annually, but estimates put it well over $1B a year. The potential removal of F-35-related revenues from this total would be a significant blow, but the loss of Canada's fighter business to the U.S., as well as disruptions in its supply chain that could also occur, would be of a higher monetary value. On the other hand, Trudeau’s tariffs launched in response to those from the United States will not immediately impact defense industries. The first raft of Canadian tariffs apply to U.S.-made consumer products like liquor, vegetables, clothing, household appliances, furniture, and sports equipment. Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau during the final day of the NATO Summit in Washington DC, United States on July 11, 2024. Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto Jakub Porzycki However, if the trade war continues, Canada has threatened to expand its actions, which may then include restrictions on the export of critical minerals and energy products to the United States, which would have an impact on the U.S. defense ecosystem. Consideration has also been given to legislation that would prevent U.S. companies from bidding on government contracts, which could effectively shut off the Canadian market to U.S. defense contractors. Overall, it remains unclear exactly how the F-35 program let alone the wider defense-industrial relationship between Canada and the United States will be affected by the current trade war. What’s clear is that the CF-18 badly needs replacement and any further holdup in the Future Fighter Capability Project would be very unwelcome news for the Canadian military. Were Canada to abandon its plans to buy the F-35, it would derail its fighter replacement timeline and a new effort would need to be restarted yet again. There is also a significant symbolic value for Canada, which is spending billions on a stealth fighter from a country that is actively fighting a trade war with it and which has the potential to crash its economy. There is also the issue of the supportability of the F-35. Canada is investing hugely in a strategic resource that needs constant support from its U.S. supplier, and this could be disrupted suddenly at the whim of the U.S. government, should it so wish. All these actions are also being watched closely by other U.S. arms customers overseas. Trump is threatening to enact the same tariffs on at least some of its European allies, as well. President Trump says that he will 'absolutely' impose tariffs on Europe pic.twitter.com/PTsC3chKFS&mdash; Dave (@EventuallyWLTHY) February 1, 2025 So, as it sits now, like many other aspects of the current economic tensions between the U.S. and Canada, it is a wait and see situation. But the longer the tariffs remain in place, the stronger the responses will be as political pressures mount.

Hunt For A MV-22 Osprey Successor For The Marines Has Begun	A newly released U.S. Marine Aviation Plan shows the service is now looking at a successor to its MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotors actively enough to give it a name: the Next Generation Assault Support (NGAS) aircraft. The Marines have previously said that they expect the Osprey to serve into the 2060s, but have left the door open for that to change depending on other developments. The V-22 series has long been a controversial aircraft with sporadic limitations imposed on its operations, but has been facing notably increased scrutiny following a three-month-long grounding last year prompted by a fatal crash of a U.S. Air Force CV-22. The U.S. Marine Corps released its latest Aviation Plan, the first it has put out publicly since 2022, earlier today. As of March 2024, the Marines had a total of 348 MV-22s in inventory and the service's objective fleet size is 360 aircraft. Marine Ospreys are currently assigned to units in the United States, as well as ones forward deployed in Japan and Djibouti. A US Marine Corps MV-22 Osprey. USMC 'Configuration, inventory, and supply chain management remain the top areas of focus as the MV-22B Osprey fleet right-sizes to meet future requirements and challenges,' the Osprey second the 2025 Aviation Plan says. The document highlights various ongoing modernization efforts, including plans to integrate new electronic warfare, communications, survivability, and Degraded Visual Environment (DVE) flight capabilities. It also notes continued safety and reliability-related work, including improvements to the proprotor gearbox that was at the center of the crash that led to last year's fleet-wide grounding. A larger Renewed V-22 Aircraft Modernization Plan (ReVAMP) 'will ensure platform relevance until the end of its service life and the development and fielding of the Next Generation Assault Support (NGAS) aircraft,' the new aviation plan adds. The Marines announced last year that they had begun initial studies into what ReVAMP might entail, including the potential for the total replacement of major structural components like wings and engine nacelles, as well as other upgrades and modifications. The Marine Corps does not appear to have previously disclosed the existence of the NGAS effort and the 2025 Aviation Plan provides no further details. TWZ has reached out to the Marines and to the U.S. Navy's Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), the latter of which serves as the central manager for major aviation programs for both services, for more information. NAVAIR also leads the V-22 Joint Program Office (JPO) overseeing the entire U.S. military Osprey family, which includes Air Force CV-22s and Navy CMV-22s. The JPO supports foreign Osprey operators, of which Japan is currently the only one, as well. A Japanese MV-22 (in the foreground) flies together with a US Marine Corps Osprey (at rear). USMC However, the basic fact of the existence of NGAS is still notable given that the Marines have pushed back when asked about planning for a V-22 successor in the past. 'It has a service life for many more years. &#8230; we're approaching in the next couple of years service-level decisions on what we do at kind of a mid-life of the V-22,' Marine Brig. Gen. Richard Joyce, Assistant Deputy Commandant for Aviation, said during a press call in March 2024 in response to a question from this author on what might come after Osprey. 'There is no taking our eye off of V-22 and the years of service like what it has in front of us.' The Marines had made Brig. Gen. Joyce available to speak TWZ and other reporters at that time about the lifting of the three-month-long grounding of V-22s following the fatal CV-22 crash, which had occurred off the coast of Japan in December 2023. A pair of US Air Force CV-22 Ospreys. USAF 'We are not having conversations right now about anything that replaces V-22. We're always thinking deep, 2040 and beyond right now, for sure. And then we are acutely focused on our V-22,' Joyce added. 'We're not talking about replacing V-22. We're thinking deep and we're focused on V-22 at mid-life.' 'ReVAMP is kind of the next cycle of this thing. So, you're going to see V-22s darkening the skies for, you know, the next 30 or 40 years without question,' Marine Col. Brian Taylor, then head of the V-22 Joint Program Office, also told TWZ and other attendees at the Modern Day Marine exhibition in April 2024. 'There is a ton of life left in this platform, and there is a ton of mission left in this platform.' Still, 'once we do this [the initial ReVAMP studies], the other question kind of goes back to the service of 'hey, is this where you want to invest? Or is there something completely different?'' Taylor added. 'So, you know, I'm a little bit biased, I would love to see the V-22 stay in service, you know, for the next 100 years. But if there's a better thing that we need to pivot to that's really kind of up to the services.' Tyler explicitly mentioned the High-Speed Vertical Takeoff and Landing (HSVTOL) program, which is a U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) effort exploring future VTOL concepts offering significant speed and range capabilities. HSVTOL is paired with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Speed and Runway Independent Technologies (SPRINT) program. Aurora Flight Sciences, a Boeing subsidiary, and Bell are currently developing demonstrator designs for SPRINT. A rendering of Aurora Flight Sciences SPRINT demonstrator, at left, alongside a larger design concept based on the same technology, at right. Aurora Flight Sciences A rendering of design concepts based on technology Bell has been developing for SPRINT and HSVTOL. Bell For its part, Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) has long lauded the unique capabilities its CV-22s offer, but also has made no secret of its view that the Osprey is an increasingly dated design. A Bell/Boeing team started the development of the Osprey back in the 1980s and there were suffered numerous serious setbacks before the Marines finally became the first service to start flying them operationally in 2007. 'The CV-22, it's been a unique capability that the special operations enterprise has always needed,' Air Force Gen. Tony D. Bauernfeind, then head of AFSOC, also told TWZ and other reporters at the time of the lifting of the grounding last March. At the same time, 'the V-22 is still 1980s, first-generation tilt-rotor technology. And we're in 2024.' Increased range, as well as greater speed to help get across those distances faster, will be key considerations for the Marine's NGAS effort, especially with an eye toward a future high-end in the Pacific against China. The Corps has touted its ability to conduct long-range and long-endurance MV-22 operations in the Pacific Region, but this presents significant challenges and resource requirements, especially when it comes to aerial refueling, as you can read more about here. Those issues would only be magnified in an actual conflict against an opponent with substantial anti-access and area denial capabilities. The same kinds of considerations have been driving SPRINT/HSVTOL and also played a major role in the U.S. Army's decision to pick a design based on Bell's advanced V-280 Valor tilt-rotor as the winner of its Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) competition. The V-280 already incorporated significant lessons Bell learned from the V-22, as you can learn more about in this past TWZ feature. FLRAA aircraft are now set to replace a substantial part of the Army's H-60 Black Hawk fleets, including special operations MH-60 variants in service with the elite 160th Special Operation Aviation Regiment (SOAR). There has been talk about a potential Marine variant or derivative of FLRAA in the past, which could be another route to an MV-22 successor in addition to leveraging SPRINT/HSVTOL. At the same time, the MV-22 currently offers features important to the Marines, such as a folding main wing and rotors to meet shipboard space requirements and a rear ramp that helps with the loading and unloading of larger cargoes, not found on the FLRAA design. It could be complicated to incorporate those and other elements into a Marine version. It's also worth noting that the Marines have looked at the V-280's smaller uncrewed cousin, the V-247 Vigilant, to meet separate requirements to provide additional strike and other capabilities. Since at least 2021, the Navy has been exploring options for replacing at least a portion of its H-60 Seahawk variants, along with its MQ-8B/C Fire Scout drone helicopters, as part of an effort called Future Vertical Lift-Maritime Strike (FVL-MS), as well. Any Marine discussions about the future of the MV-22 now also come amid serious new scrutiny of the entire Osprey program following last year's grounding, including from members of Congress on both sides of the political aisle. Much of the Osprey fleet was just grounded again briefly in December following another mishap involving a CV-22. 'As the backbone of Marine Corps combat assault transport capability, MV-22B squadrons have conducted a total of 109 operational deployments and flown over 588,000 flight hours since 2007. The MV-22B flies approximately twice as many flight hours per year as any other Marine Corps rotary-wing aircraft,' the Marine Corps 2025 Aviation Plan does note, reiterating long-standing talking points about the checked record. 'The MV-22 maintains mishap rates on par with other Marine Aviation assets. As of 1 August 2024, the MV-22’s 10-year (2014-2024) Class A mishap rate is 3.15 per every 100,000 flights [sic] hours, lower than the Marine Corps average of 3.24.' There is considerable uncertainty around the general outlook for U.S. defense spending under the new Trump administration, as well. Though much remains to be learned about the Marine Corps NGAS plans, the service is now formally looking ahead to what comes after the MV-22. Update: 2:30 PM EST – The U.S. Marine Corps has now provided additional information about the NGAS plan and the future outlook for the service's MV-22s. 'The Next Generation Assault Support (NGAS) will fit within Project Eagle, which is Marine Aviation’s strategic approach over the next three Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) cycles to feed the Requirements and Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) process. The Capability Development Document (CDD) development phase for the NGAS is forecasted for the early 2030s, which will guide Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) and prototyping beginning in the mid-2030s,' a spokesperson for the Marine Corps' top headquarters at the Pentagon told TWZ. 'Early material solution analysis is ongoing as Marine Aviation closely follows the Army’s Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) program and considers technology development initiatives within the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and across industry. Digital engineering, open architectures, and a modernized acquisition approach will underline Headquarters Marine Corps (HQMC) and Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Experimental Modernization and Advanced Development Team (XMA-ADT)’s strategy towards capability development and fielding of NGAS.' 'The V-22 Osprey is anticipated to remain in service through 2055. This extended operational timeline is supported by ongoing modernization efforts aimed at addressing specific capability and reliability requirements,' the Marine spokesperson added. 'These efforts include component replacement, system redesign, and predictive maintenance initiatives to enhance platform reliability and support the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) and Joint Force in future operating environments. Modernization initiatives will ensure that the V-22 continues to meet the evolving needs of the Marine Corps, providing critical medium lift assault support capabilities well into the future.'

The Navy Nearly Built A Nuclear Armed 'Super Sidewinder' Air-To-A...	While the 1950s was a time of truly unusual and fast-paced innovation in military aerospace, one of the more bizarre projects was for a nuclear-armed, liquid-fueled development of the Sidewinder air-to-air missile that would have featured a novel dual-mode guidance system. Although the planned Diamondback never made it into service, its story provides an interesting counterpoint to the hugely successful Sidewinder and the Navy’s on-off search for longer-range air-to-air weapons in the years that followed. A compilation video published by the China Lake Alumni provides some background on the Diamondback (starting at around the 7:30 mark) and other missile developments: Work on the Diamondback began back in 1956 when the now-classic Sidewinder air-to-air missile was still very much a new product. At that time still designated AAM-N-7, the heat-seeking Sidewinder had only entered full-scale production in March 1955 and was still to make its combat debut, which would occur over the Taiwan Strait three years later. The full and fascinating back story to the development of the Sidewinder is something you can read about in this previous article. Already at this early stage, however, the Navy was looking at new kinds of air-to-air missiles that could be developed from the Sidewinder and which would provide improved performance and superior kill probability. An early Sidewinder about to hit a QF-86 drone at China Lake. via Rowland White With that in mind, the Naval Ordnance Test Station (NOTS) at China Lake, California, began studies for what was initially dubbed 'Super Sidewinder.' The new missile was quickly renamed Diamondback, after the snake — like the sidewinder, another species of pit viper, all of which use heat sensors to find their prey. The new missile was expected to enter service around 1960. Intended to fly farther and faster than the Sidewinder, the Diamondback would need a new propulsion system. The original Sidewinder had been rapidly developed, originally being based around a repurposed five-inch aerial rocket. Early versions of the Sidewinder were powered by a Thiokol Mk 17 solid-fuel rocket motor developing 4,000 pounds of thrust, enough to boost it to a speed of Mach 1.7 and to reach a target at a distance of up to three miles (in the best-case scenario). Early examples of the Sidewinder, the U.S. Navy’s first operational air-to-air guided missile, mounted on an F9F-8 Cougar fighter. Getty Images Bettmann A U.S. Navy public relations photo showing a pilot next to an AAM-N-7 Sidewinder air-to-air missile in 1956. U.S. Navy For the Diamondback, NOTS opted for a more complicated type of rocket, a dual-pulse motor powered by liquid fuel. While dual pulse is now found in some longer-range modern missiles, it was very much cutting-edge technology at this time. A dual-pulse motor ensures the missile retains energy across the flight envelope, stretching its range and, just as importantly, ensuring it can maneuver hard enough to hit a target even during the ‘end game’ of the engagement. A scale test article for the Diamondback. Public Domain The motor in the Diamondback would be derived from developed by NOTS for the Liquid Propellant Aircraft Rocket (LAR). Begun in 1949, LAR was intended to provide a five-inch air-to-air (unguided) rocket, which would offer superior performance compared with the solid-propellant rockets otherwise used at the time. The propellant was a storable mixture of RFNA and hydrazine that was hypergolic — meaning that the propellants ignited on leaving the engine. It’s likely the same would have been used to power the Diamondback. The new powerplant was expected to give a considerable performance boost compared to the Sidewinder, with a maximum range of between 15 and 20 miles and a speed of over Mach 3. The flight ceiling would also have been impressive, with the missile able to reach an altitude of 80,000 feet, far higher than any turbine-powered aircraft was then operating. A contemporary advertisement for Diamondback shows a highly stylized high-speed Soviet bomber. YouTube screencap Coupled with its planned sparkling performance, the Diamondback was also to have much more stopping power than the Sidewinder. The early AAM-N-7 carried a conventional blast-fragmentation warhead weighing just 10 pounds. This was triggered by an infrared proximity or contact fuze and conferred an effective kill radius of around 30 feet. Different warhead options were considered for the Diamondback. One of these was a more powerful continuous-rod conventional warhead. A continuous-rod warhead is designed to produce an expanding zigzag ring of connected rods, to inflict a continuous ‘line’ of structural damage over the target surface. A drawing of the proposed Diamondback missile, dated February 1957. Public Domain More radical still was a low-yield nuclear warhead, developed by China Lake’s Special Weapons Division, which would have a yield of 0.75 kilotons. At this point in the Cold War, nuclear warheads were seen as a viable solution for making a harder-hitting bomber-killer weapon. Such weapons were intended to take out larger or high-priority targets, namely entire formations of bombers. While the nuclear-armed AIR-2 Genie unguided air-to-air rocket is the best known of these, there was also the GAR-11, later redesignated the AIM-26A, or ‘Nuclear Falcon,’ which was the only guided nuclear-armed air-to-air missile ever deployed by the U.S. military. The GAR-11 carried a W54 warhead with a yield of 0.5 kilotons. The nuclear-armed AIM-26A missile. San Diego Air And Space Museum Archive To pack in the new motor and more lethal warhead, the Diamondback would have been considerably bigger than the Sidewinder. The first-generation Sidewinder was 9.3 feet long and had a fin span of 22 inches; its body diameter remained at five inches. Meanwhile, the Diamondback would have been 12.3 feet long, with a wingspan of 40 inches; the body diameter was 12 inches. Overall, the Diamondback would have tipped the scales at 850 pounds, compared with just 155 pounds for the early-model Sidewinder. A wind tunnel test model for Diamondback. YouTube screencap The Diamondback would have used what was, for its time, a highly unusual dual-mode guidance, with an infrared seeker combined with a passive-homing radar. Some air defense missiles today use dual-mode guidance, notably the Israeli Stunner, but it remains rare. Presumably, the Diamondback solution was chosen to make the missile more reliable: if the missile’s optical seeker lost the target lock, then the passive radar seeker should still remain locked onto the target, or vice-versa. Unlike the Stunner, however, there would have been no datalink to provide the missile with mid-course updates and it would have to rely on its dual-mode seeker throughout the engagement. While the earlier Sidewinders were only able to attack targets from the rear sector, the Diamondback was also expected to be able to attack targets head-on. Specifically, an NOTS document refers to engaging Mach-2 bombers (at 70,000 feet) and fighters (at 40,000 feet) 'in both front and rear-hemisphere approach, at firing ranges of 10-15 miles.' This was an advantage that would have been enabled by the radar seeker, while infrared seekers of the time were only effective in a tail-on attack. A page from an NOTS document about Diamondback’s performance. YouTube screencap According to available accounts, the Diamondback studies at NOTS were generally successful. However, work on the project had come to an end by around 1958. Apparently, the Navy saw little operational use for such a missile. This may well have been driven by the fact that it was the U.S. Air Force that had primary responsibility for the homeland defense mission, for which a heavy ‘bomber-killer’ type of missile was much better suited. It should be remembered that the Navy did briefly contribute to the North American Air Defense Command (NORAD) on a formal basis, but it only ever had a single squadron allocated to the task. This was All-Weather Fighter Squadron 3, or VF(AW)-3, that operated the F4D Skyray on behalf of the command in the late 1950s, and which was based at Naval Air Station North Island, California. Two U.S. Navy F4D-1 Skyrays of All-Weather Fighter Squadron 3 from Naval Air Station North Island, California, in around 1960. U.S. Navy It’s unclear whether the Skyray was a candidate to carry the Diamondback, but it was envisaged for the F3H Demon and the F4H Phantom, two other carrier-based all-weather fighters. A diagram showing Diamondback and Sidewinder carriage on the F3H Demon. Public Domain A diagram showing Diamondback carriage on the F4H Phantom. Public Domain By the end of the 1950s, the Navy had introduced the Sparrow air-to-air missile, with semi-active radar homing (SARH) guidance. But this still fell some way short of the performance promised for the Diamondback. In its initial SARH form, the Sparrow had a maximum range of around six miles — in optimum conditions. The Navy Sparrow’s performance in the Vietnam War was also notably disappointing. As for the Sidewinder, this went on to become the short-range weapon of choice for most Western air arms, and its combat record and continued development are well known. More recently, there have also been suggestions that the Sidewinder — namely the latest AIM-9X — could be evolved into a completely new and longer-range missile, for a modern equivalent of the Diamondback. As it was, soon after the demise of the Diamondback, the Navy revisited the idea of a longer-range air-to-air missile. With the new threat of Soviet bombers launching long-range cruise missiles, work began on the F6D Missileer that would be armed with AAM-N-10 Eagle long-range air-to-air missiles, the capabilities of which would be harnessed by the AWG-9 fire control system. Ultimately, the Missileer was canceled, but starting in 1960 the Navy began work on what would become the AIM-54 Phoenix (then known as the AAM-N-11). Together with the AWG-9, this would equip the F-14 Tomcat and become a cornerstone of fleet air defense for many years. A U.S. Navy F-14 carries an AIM-54 Phoenix long-range air-to-air missile under the wing. U.S. Navy Now, the Navy is back in the long-range air-to-air missile game, with an air-launched variant of the multi-role, long-range surface-launched SM-6 missile, the AIM-174B, As you can read about here and watch our explainer video on it below, this weapon appears to have been developed very much with a future Pacific war in mind, in particular, to defend naval assets against long-range Chinese attacks and to pierce China's anti-access bubble. The AIM-260, which will have greater range than the AIM-120 but less than the AIM-174B, all in a similar form factor as the AIM-120, is also deep in development. While the intriguing Diamondback may have been ‘too much too soon’ for the Navy, which was only starting to introduce its first-generation air-to-air missiles, it remains a fascinating part of the lineage of longer-reaching aerial weapons for the service.

Bunker Talk: Let’s Talk About All The Things We Did And Didn’t Co...	Welcome to Bunker Talk. This is a weekend open discussion post for the best commenting crew on the net, in which we can chat about all the stuff that went on this week that we didn’t cover. We can also talk about the stuff we did or whatever else grabs your interest. In other words, it’s an off-topic thread. The caption to this week’s top shot reads: Defunct missile silo, Marin Headlands, California. [It's Nike Missile Site SF-88] Also, a reminder: Prime Directives! If you want to talk politics, do so respectfully and know that there’s always somebody that isn’t going to agree with you. If you have political differences, hash it out respectfully, stick to the facts, and no childish name-calling or personal attacks of any kind. If you can’t handle yourself in that manner, then please, discuss virtually anything else. No drive-by garbage political memes. No conspiracy theory rants. Links to crackpot sites will be axed, too. Trolling and shitposting will not be tolerated. No obsessive behavior about other users. Just don’t interact with folks you don’t like. Do not be a sucker and feed trolls! That’s as much on you as on them. Use the mute button if you don’t like what you see. So unless you have something of quality to say, know how to treat people with respect, understand that everyone isn’t going to subscribe to your exact same worldview, and have come to terms with the reality that there is no perfect solution when it comes to moderation of a community like this, it’s probably best to just move on.

Nearly All Helicopter Traffic Around Reagan National Airport Has ...	The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has banned virtually all helicopter flights around Reagan National Airport and parts of the surrounding Potomac River. This comes in the tragic collision of a U.S. Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter and an American Airlines CRJ700 airliner above the river on Tuesday night. Recovery of the victims and wreckage of the two aircraft is poised to enter a new phase this weekend as the investigation into the circumstances of the incident continues. Readers can first get up to speed on what is already known about the incident in TWZ's past reporting here. Under the new FAA restrictions, sections of two designated helicopter flight corridors that run up and down the Potomac, known as Routes 1 and 4, are now shut down between the Memorial and Wilson Bridges. The UH-60 involved in the collision had been traveling along Route 4 at the time. Portions of the surrounding airspace, including over Reagan National, are also closed to helicopter traffic. A map of the complete restricted area is seen below. U.S. Department of Transportation/FAA 'The restriction exempts helicopters entering this airspace for lifesaving medical support, active law enforcement, active air defense, or presidential transport helicopter missions that must operate in this restricted area,' according to a press release from the U.S. Department of Transportation. 'Any helicopter operations outside these exemptions will be prohibited. These restrictions will remain in place until the NTSB completes its preliminary investigation of the air carrier incident at which point it will be reviewed based on NTSB’s report.' 'Today’s decision will immediately help secure the airspace near Reagan Airport, ensuring the safety of airplane and helicopter traffic,' Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy also said in a statement. 'This is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation’s ongoing commitment to safeguarding our nation’s skies and upholding the highest standards of air travel safety.' 'FAA investigators are supporting the NTSB-led investigation of Wednesday night’s midair collision near Reagan Washington National Airport,' per a brief separate statement posted on the FAA's website today accompanying proactive responses to a list of frequently asked questions. 'The NTSB is leading the investigation and will provide all updates. We cannot comment on any aspect of open investigations. [emphasis in the original] The FAA will quickly take any actions necessary based on evidence from the investigation. ' At a briefing tonight, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) also provided new details about the ongoing recovery efforts and investigation. Wreckage of the UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter involved in the collision in the Potomac River awaiting recovery. USCG Petty Officer 1st Class Brandon Giles The U.S. Navy's office of the Supervisor of Salvage and Diving (SUPSALV) is currently leading efforts to recover the wreckage and has large crane barges on the way now to assist. The U.S. Coast Guard and other federal, state, and local authorities have also been on scene. The lifting of known large sections of the two aircraft is expected to start this weekend. 'The supervisor of salvage is also conducting a debris mapping right now. This will help in our post-accident analysis&#8230; It will also help us with understanding some of the air worthiness and crash worthiness and human factors,' NTSB member J. Todd Inman explained. 'We have right now two distinct debris fields&#8230; The good news is based upon the initial mapping, while there are some small aspects of that debris field, there are large chunks that will be easily recoverable, and it will aid in the investigation when we bring it into the secured facility.' That same secure facility already has complete representative aircraft similar to the CRJ700 that went down so that investigators can compare the wreckage to it as part of the investigation, according to Inman. Canadian authorities separately announced earlier that they are supporting the investigation because the CRJ700 is a design that originated in that country. NTSB's Inman also noted that the fight data and cockpit voice recorders from the American Airlines flight have already been recovered. The flight data recorder was in good condition, but the cockpit voice recorder had water intrusion, which Inman said is uncommon in such cases. NTSB experts have been preparing to attempt downloads of the data from both devices.

In terms of the victims, the Unified Command leading the recovery efforts said earlier today that 41 sets of remains had been recovered so far, with 28 positively identified. There were 64 crew and passengers on American Airlines Flight 5342 and three members of the U.S. Army onboard the UH-60. Today, Unified Command provided an update on recovery operations in the Potomac River.If you missed the news conference, you can find the presentation at pic.twitter.com/1041kcGrEp&mdash; DC Fire and EMS Department (@dcfireems) January 31, 2025 The U.S. Army separately identified two of three members of the Black Hawk's crew as Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland, one of the pilots, and Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O’Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia, a crew chief. The service withheld the name of the second pilot, a woman, at the request of her family. At least as of earlier today, Eaves and the female aviator were listed as duty status-whereabouts unknown (DUSTWUN), meaning they have not been formally assessed to be missing or deceased. The UH-60 and its crew, all assigned to the specialized 12th Aviation Battalion based at Fort Belvoir in Virginia, were on a routine nighttime proficiency training flight related to the unit's contingency of government mission, which you can read more about here.

Like Eaves, she served as a pilot.Eaves was serving as an instructor pilot as his colleague underwent an annual proficiency test.&mdash; Dan Lamothe (@DanLamothe) January 31, 2025 Speaking today, NTSB's Inman declared that the collision 'should not have happened' and that 'we have in aviation what's called a Swiss cheese approach, wherein if something fails, a backup should catch it, [we have] multiple layers of redundancy.' However, he did not elaborate on the circumstances of the incident as it may be known to investigators now and refused to speculate about potential causes or factors. Other U.S. officials, including President Donald Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, have publicly highlighted questions about the altitude at which the UH-60 was flying at the time. 'We're looking at altitude &#8230; someone was at the wrong altitude,' Hegseth said during an interview on Fox earlier today, adding that the black boxes from the Black Hawk had not yet been recovered. 'There could be depth perception problems. Again, that's speculation. Our investigation will tell us more.' 'You have a lot of ambient light, a lot of things happenign around Reagan [Int'l Airport]' per Hegseth 'There could be depth perception problems - again, that's speculation. Our investigation will tell us more'&mdash; Jeff Seldin (@jseldin) January 31, 2025 'Who was talking? Who was on the comms? Who was piloting? And then what, if any confusion was there at the end?' per SecDef Hegseth'We're looking at altitude&#8230;someone was at the wrong altitude'&mdash; Jeff Seldin (@jseldin) January 31, 2025 'The Blackhawk helicopter was flying too high, by a lot. It was far above the 200 foot limit,' Trump also wrote in a post on Truth Social 'That’s not really too complicated to understand, is it???' Prior to the incident, FAA rules required helicopters flying in that part of Route 4 to stay at or below 200 feet mean sea level altitude (MSL). Videos shot from the ground, such as the more recently emerged ones seen below, have pointed to a near head-on impact between the Black Hawk and the CRJ700, though the exact altitudes of the two aircraft at the time remain unknown. New Footage has been released, showing Wednesday Night’s Mid-Air Collision between a CRJ-700 Passenger Jet, operated by PSA Airlines, and a U.S. Army H-60 'Black Hawk' Helicopter at Reagan Washington National Airport near Washington D.C, which resulted in 67 Deaths. pic.twitter.com/MOfBnqHiIp&mdash; OSINTdefender (@sentdefender) January 31, 2025 #Exclusive dash-cam video reveals a previously unseen angle of the plane and helicopter collision over the Potomac River on Wednesday night. #PotomacCollision #DashCam #BreakingNews #planecrash #Video #America #american #Trump #TrumpIsUnfitForOffice #TrumpisaNationalDisgrace pic.twitter.com/LTGUy6ZK8h&mdash; Ali Shunnaq (@schunnaq) January 30, 2025 'I'm just going to preempt it. Off-the-shelf software programs are not always as accurate as the data we specifically get from ADS-B [the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast network], [and] from the black boxes,' NTSB's Inman said. 'All of that are factors that come into our investigation.' 'We will go back and look at any air traffic controller that was involved in this. We'll go back and look at their past probably 72 hours, even two or three weeks. We'll look at their training, their hiring, everything. What they probably ate that day. But it is not one point that tells us everything,' Inman added when asked about reportedly abnormal air traffic control staffing at the time of the collision. 'It's layered into a lot of other information that's very critical.' 'Obviously, we'll be looking at not only staffing that day, [but] progressively staffing. How many people, what job functions they were doing? Were they being combined? Were they not? What was the weather outside? What was the number of landings?' he continued. 'I recall back during COVID, one runway [at Reagan National] was being used. Runway One. That was the only one. [Runway] 33, as traffic came back, started being opened up. So we would look at changes in traffic patterns, construction at the airport, all of that. It all paints a very big picture.' The collision this week has already thrust long-standing concerns about airspace congestion around Reagan National Airport, and its history of near-collisions, back into the public eye. Just in the days leading up to the incident, at least two other airliners had to abort their approaches due to helicopters getting too close.

The airspace around Washington, D.C., and the greater National Capital Region (NRC), which is some of the most densely defended and heavily monitored in the country, not to mention extremely busy, creates additional challenges. The aforementioned helicopter routes that are now partially shut down are just some of the especially regimented rules and regulations that govern air traffic around the nation's capital. Current and former military helicopter pilots talked about these issues in detail in interviews with TWZ yesterday, which you can find here. With recovery efforts and other data collection still underway, NTSB's Inman cautioned today that there is still much investigative work to be done before final firm conclusions about what happened this week over the Potomac can be reached.

Ukraine Intel Chief Disputes Claim That North Koreans Have Fled K...	North Korean troops are still fighting on the front lines in Kursk, though their activities have been reduced in recent days amid heavy casualties, the head of Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Directorate told The War Zone exclusively on Friday. Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov said media reports that those troops have not been seen on the front lines there in weeks are 'wrong.' There are still about 8,000 North Koreans battling Ukraine on the front lines in Kursk, said Budanov, head of the Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR). However, that’s been in a reduced capacity of late, and Ukrainian officials are trying to determine what the change means. 'We have to wait some time to see if there are any real changes or if this is just lower activities for a couple of days,' Budanov explained. The War Zone cannot independently verify his claims. Contrary to some reporting, North Korean troops remain on the front lines says Ukrainian Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov (Howard Altman photo) Ukrainian Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov talked about a wide range of topics during his exclusive interview with The War Zone Wednesday. (Howard Altman/staff photo) Budanov acknowledged to us that his comments contradict reporting by The New York Times and other media outlets about the current status of North Korean troops in Kursk. 'Reports in the media are wrong,' he avowed. On Friday, the Times reported that 'North Korean soldiers who joined their Russian allies in battle against Ukrainian forces have been pulled off the front lines after suffering heavy casualties, according to Ukrainian and U.S. officials. The North Korean troops, sent to bolster Russian forces trying to push back a Ukrainian offensive inside Russia’s borders, have not been seen at the front for about two weeks, the officials said after requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive military and intelligence matters.' CNN, citing a Ukrainian Special Operations Forces spokesman, offered a similar take. 'The presence of DPRK troops has not been observed for about three weeks, and they were probably forced to withdraw after suffering heavy losses,' Colonel Oleksandr Kindratenko told the network. In a statement to Ukrainian Pravda, however, Kindratenko tempered his remarks, saying 'The Special Operations Forces provide information only about the front where our units are active.' The recent spate of reporting about the status of North Korean forces follows comments made earlier this week by a top advisor to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. 'Some North Korean units have been pulled back from the front line in the Kursk region, according to reports from Ukraine’s Special Operations Forces,' Mikhalio Podolyak stated on X. 'It turns out that even Kim Jong-un values the lives of his subjects more than Putin values Russians. The Eastern monarch considers losses of 40% of personnel unacceptable. Meanwhile, Putin sends wave after wave of people from Russia’s poorest regions to storm Ukrainian positions—on old Ladas, motorcycles, scooters, and even crutches.' Some North Korean units have been pulled back from the front line in the #Kursk region, according to reports from Ukraine’s Special Operations Forces. It turns out that even Kim Jong-un values the lives of his subjects more than #Putin values Russians. The Eastern monarch…&mdash; Михайло Подоляк (@Podolyak_M) January 29, 2025 Last fall, North Korea sent about 12,000 troops to Kursk to help Russia dislodge Ukraine, which invaded that territory in August. They began to appear on the battlefield in large numbers by December. Since then, they have suffered about 4,000 casualties, including killed and wounded, Budanov told us today. That coincides with figures recently published by the BBC, citing unnamed 'Western officials.' The War Zone cannot independently confirm casualty numbers. Budanov chalked up those losses to 'a lack of real combat experience' and conducting so-called ‘meat waves’ against dug-in Ukrainian forces with limited support. The North Koreans have been attacking 'almost without any combat vehicles,' he posited. The reason they are so willing to push forward on foot against Ukrainian drones and artillery is their fealty to North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, Budanov suggested. That disregard for personal safety is 'absolutely' making it harder for Ukraine to defend against, he added. You can see one of those assaults in the video below.

However, the lines have held steady in recent days, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) and the Ukrainian DeepState open-source intelligence group. 'Russian forces continued offensive operations within the Ukrainian salient in Kursk Oblast on January 30 but did not make any confirmed advances,' ISW reported in its latest assessment.

Those troops would not conduct ground combat operations, Budanov said. North Korea has provided about 120 170mm M1989 Koksan self-propelled artillery guns and 120 M-1991 240mm multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) to Russia in the last three months, he told us earlier this month.

(Via X) As we have frequently reported, this all comes as both sides are jockeying for territory ahead of any peace deal that U.S. President Donald Trump says he will broker, the details of which remain uncertain. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksy said his country invaded Kursk to set up a buffer against Russian attacks and serve as a bargaining chip in future negotiations. A large reduction of North Korean troops on the front lines - something Budanov told us is being analyzed - could ease pressure on Ukraine’s Kursk salient. The longer Ukraine stays there, the more bargaining power Zelensky could have.

How Life Aboard A Navy Aircraft Carrier Changed When High-Speed I...	As it battled Houthi threats around the Red Sea last year, the USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72) also served as a testbed for vastly increasing the level of internet connectivity aboard the Navy's deployed ships. Now we are learning specific details about how this mammoth change in at-sea connectedness impacted everything from how sailors went about their lives during a grueling deployment to how the ship and its air wing brought its firepower to bear on the enemy. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighters assigned to the carrier offer a case in point for what more shipboard bandwidth — provided by commercial providers like Starlink and OneWeb — can mean at the tactical level. Jets with the embarked Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 314 took on critical mission data file updates in record time last fall due to the carrier’s internet innovations, a capability that is slated to expand across the fleet. 'This file offers intelligence updates and design enhancements that enable pilots to identify and counter threats in specific operational environments,' the Navy said in an October release announcing the feat. 'The update incorporated more than 100 intelligence changes and multiple design improvements, significantly enhancing the aircraft's survivability and lethality.' A F-35C Joint Strike Fighter assigned to Marine Fighter Attack Squadron (VMFA) 314 on the flight deck of the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72) during its 2024 deployment. (U.S. Navy) Normally, such an update would take far longer, but it happened so fast in part due to the efforts of Capt. Kevin White, then the Lincoln’s combat systems officer, to make his carrier more connected to the internet in recent years. 'So [the Navy] reported that they delivered F-35 mission data file updates in record time,' White said this week at the annual WEST conference, which TWZ attended. 'Yeah, we were doing that. And then they reported the first combat strikes in Yemen from F-35s. The enhanced nature of those strikes was because we were able to do this.' The Lincoln’s deployment last year to the Middle East became a sea change signifier of how a ship connected to the internet via non-military satellite constellations can fight more effectively, while also offering a host of benefits when it comes to training, maintenance and maintaining crew morale when the working days are long and the port calls are few. White noted how the F-35 'eats and breathes data daily,' and it has to be shared with commands ashore. The connectivity innovations he’s pioneered will enable such data transfers, which will only grow more complex over time. 'If you can’t get the data onboard, you’re probably going to be at a loss,' White said. 'So large file transfer capability increases combat readiness.' As TWZ previously reported, White’s work comprises the Navy’s Sailor Edge Afloat and Ashore (SEA2) program. It aims to provide high-bandwidth, resilient global connectivity for warships. It was largely conceived and tested out by White aboard the Lincoln, and the deployment last year offered further proof that the system can work. Such SEA2 systems have been tested aboard other ships as well. The Navy has identified Starlink and OneWeb as some of the private providers it is using for the effort. A sailor aboard the amphibious assault ship USS Wasp (LHD-1), uses the ship’s enhanced bandwidth to video call his wife and newborn in November. (U.S. Navy) It involves moving some communications aspects away from proprietary Defense Department satellites, while leaning on commercial satellite constellations and even cellular providers to keep ships more connected at sea for both personal and tactical uses. While White’s talk this week offered some real-world indications of its benefits, TWZ extensively reported on the technical aspects of the effort last year. SEA2 is now slated to become a funded Navy program of record. It will be known as Flank Speed Wireless, and efforts are underway to harden connectivity to an enterprise level, while scaling the innovations, said White, who is now assigned to Naval Information Warfare Systems Command. 'This is being discussed at all levels of the Navy right now,' he said. During Lincoln’s cruise, White was transferring at download speeds of 1 gigabyte per second, with 200 megabytes on the upload, he said, provided to the 5,000 sailors on board for personal and work use. White said there was not one equipment failure aboard Lincoln related to connectivity in the past two years, and that 780 terabytes of data was transferred during the five-and-a-half month cruise. 'I set a goal for a petabyte, but I missed that,' he said. 'So there’s room for my relief to excel.' Lincoln averaged four to eight terabytes of transferred data a day, 50 times greater than the fleet’s current capabilities. His team managed 7,000 IP addresses, with two full-time system administrators, one on during the day and one at night. To be sure, the system was turned off at the commander’s discretion, particularly when Lincoln was in some of the Red Sea’s weapons engagement zone, and its use always took a backseat to the mission. 'We are not going to get into the details, but this is not counter-detectable,' Lincoln’s commanding officer, Capt. Pete 'Repete' Riebe, told WEST attendees. 'They did not know our location from what we were using. Now, when we went deep into the weapons engagement zone, we turned it all off. We turned the email traffic off, we turned the WiFi off.' The U.S. Navy says it is on the verge of having persistent, reliable, and secure high-speed internet connections across its fleets thanks to a project leveraging commercial satellite constellations like SpaceX's Starlink. A commercial satellite array is shown here being installed aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72). (U.S. Navy) But when the system was on, it provided not only mission benefits, but benefits to the hard-working Lincoln crew as well, which was at sea for 107 days at one point with no port calls, Riebe said. 'Sailors being up on their WiFi, being connected to home, is really what made that doable in this day and age,' he said. White said the average age of an embarked Lincoln sailor was 20.8, and Riebe noted that to attract young people into service, the Navy needs to recognize the innate connection they have to their devices. 'The next generation of sailors grew up with a cell phone in their hand, and they are uncomfortable without it,' Riebe said. 'I don’t necessarily like that, but that’s reality, and if we want to compete for the best folks coming into the Navy, we need to offer them bandwidth at sea.' Having better connectivity also helped with the ship’s administrative functions, Riebe said, making medical, dental and other work far easier than they have been in the past. 'All of that requires bandwidth, and [White] provided it to the ship, and we’re able to make the ship run more smoothly, more efficiently,' he said. A sailor who can FaceTime with his family back home carries less non-Navy stress with them as they focus on the life-or-death duties at hand, White said. 'What we tried to do was enable a safe space for those online connections, to allow sailors to continue their continuity of life,' he said. 'When it's time to turn those connections off, the sailors are ready to run to the fire. They are ready to run to the fight, and that is what we saw on Abraham Lincoln.' Capt. Pete Riebe, commanding officer of the USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72). (U.S. Navy) This beefed-up bandwidth allowed 38 sailors to witness the birth of their child, while others were able to watch their kids’ sporting events, White said. Several crew members pursued doctorate and master’s degrees while deployed due to better internet, while others were able to deal with personal or legal issues they had left behind back home. One officer was able to commission his wife remotely from the ship. Dental imaging for a sailor’s custom crown moved through this enhanced bandwidth and that crown was later delivered to the ship, although White noted that medical databases remain 'kind of cumbersome' to interact with, but that it lightens the load for the ship’s tactical online systems. Content streaming posed some challenges, when it comes to copyright infringement 'and activities that we’re not allowed to pass,' White said. But Lincoln was able to offer services like Netflix to sailors, as well as sporting events and access to basic internet luxuries, like fantasy football stats. Better bandwidth also allowed sailors to order from Amazon and other online sellers. While it usually took about a month to get the package to the ship, the morale benefit was undeniable, he said. White recalled a sailor walking with a package and asking her what she had ordered. 'She’s like, I don’t know, I forgot,' he recalled. Young sailors view internet connectivity almost like an innate thing they are owed, and having it onboard the Lincoln provided a massive boost for them, Cmdr. Eric Dente, commanding officer of Electronic Attack Squadron 133, which was embarked aboard the Lincoln, told TWZ. 'The ability to provide that connectivity … is a real boost for our sailors, who have learned in their lives to almost view having internet as just something that’s provided to them, like fresh water and food,' Dente said. Navy EA-18G Growler jets assigned to Electronic Attack Squadron 133. (U.S. Navy) On the operational side, from 'the most desolate waters,' Lincoln used its bandwidth to connect with a command in Norfolk, which undertook the ship’s annual cybersecurity scans 'from halfway around the world,' White said. 'And we did it, we scanned all of our devices, we validated our authority to operate compliantly,' he said. 'They validated the firmware and the device structure online … so that demonstrates that element of scalability moving forward. We should enable this type of capability, fleet-wide, write large.' Lincoln even helped fellow carriers USS Harry S. Truman and USS Carl Vinson to help them connect similarly online, he said. Other benefits were found on the tactical side of things as well. 'A lot of tactical connected systems are actually approved to run commercial, and we should utilize that opportunity to our advantage,' White said. 'We get high speed, low latency and we can also get preferred routing paths … We demonstrated several [use cases] during our deployment, and we were able to demonstrate some game-changing capability that we will pivot to moving forward.' During a stopover in Guam, the Lincoln used six cellular antennas to connect to local cellular sites, White said. The ship ended up testing this capability at sea, achieving 5G connectivity 100 miles from shore. 'And then we immediately took it down at the end, because this was not rigged for the at-sea environment,' he added. 'Put it away, but it just shows the opportunity.' Taxpayer dollars can also be saved if a ship isn’t paying for WiFi access while in port, White noted, and the crew was able to start getting to know Italian allies online before an exercise, enhancing the personal aspects of such partnerships. Then-Cmdr. Kevin White, combat systems officer on USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72), poses with an Italian counterpart during a video call made possible by the carrier's enhanced internet bandwidth. (U.S. Navy) More bandwidth also means more onboard training, meaning some sailors who don’t have to leave to go to the school house, and sailors were able to get answers to maintenance questions from ashore commands faster as well. 'Just by being able to have more reliable access to support resources, we definitely become more effective at maintenance,' White said. While taking its turn battling the Houthis in the Red Sea, the Lincoln has offered a vital proving ground for connecting a deployed ship close to the level enjoyed by all Americans back home. With proper security protocols and other institutional guardrails, better deployed bandwidth appears poised to be a game-changer for what a ship, and its sailors, can do while at sea.

Air-To-Air Anti-Drone Interceptor Set To Evolve From ‘Cheap’ Crui...	A relatively low-cost cruise missile that the U.S. Air Force is now developing could transform into an air-launched counter-drone weapon. The service previously disclosed that it is also eyeing an anti-ship version of the ostensibly air-to-ground Extended Range Attack Munition (ERAM), work on which first started primarily to meet the needs of the Ukrainian armed forces. The Air Force has confirmed to TWZ that a 'capability' called the Fixed Wing, Air Launched, Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems Ordnance (FALCO) is among multiple subsystems that could be added to future versions of ERAM. Earlier this month, the Stand-In Strike Division of the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center’s Armament Directorate, based at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, had put out a contracting notice regarding ERAM that named FALCO by acronym only and provided no further details. That same notice mentioned the seeker developed under the separate Quicksink anti-ship munition program, as well as two additional capabilities called Marshall Deck of Cards (Marshall DoC) and Shepherd, which we have now also been told are classified. A composite image showing a 3D printed model of the seeker developed under the Quicksink anti-ship munitions program (at right) and a capture from a video showing a test of a modified Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) precision-guided bomb fitted with that seeker being employed against a target ship (at left). USAF/Joseph Trevithick 'As for ERAM, the current state of the program is we are in Phase 1 of a 3 Phased approach to weapon development, test, production, and employment,' an Air Force spokesperson at Eglin told TWZ. 'The RFI [request for information contracting notice] was released as a mechanism to produce market research to procure sub-systems and ornaments from BAE [Systems] for follow-on ERAM variants, in addition to being useful for other weapons.' 'FALCO is a counter-UAS capability,' the spokesperson added. 'The RFI market research should allow the program office to purchase test assets and or production variants in support of program objectives.' What FALCO consists of in its current form and what it might take to adapt it to ERAM is unknown. For use in the anti-air role, active and/or passive seekers, or some form of command guidance, would be required. TWZ previously reached out to BAE Systems for more information about FALCO and the other subsystems named in the RFI, and we have now done so again. Details about the core ERAM design also remain limited. As we wrote previously: 'In a previous contracting notice, the Air Force laid out requirements for a 500-pound-class precision munition with a range of up to 250 miles while flying at a speed of at least Mach 0.6. The weapon also has to use an INS-based guidance package 'capable of operating in a GPS degraded environment' and that offers 'terminal Accuracy' of 'CEP 50 w/in 10m' (the ability to impact within 10 meters, or around 33 feet, of a specified point at least 50 percent of the time) in 'both in non-EMI (Electromagnetic Interference) and high EMI environments (includes GPS degraded).'' The Air Force has a clear interest in new and lower-cost air-to-air capabilities, especially for use against drones and subsonic cruise missiles. TWZ exclusively confirmed just this week that the service's F-16 Viper fighters have been shooting down drones launched by Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen using laser-guided 70mm Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II (APKWS II) rockets. APKWS II was originally developed as a cheaper air-to-ground precision munition. In 2019, the Air Force announced it had successfully demonstrated the ability to use rockets in the air-to-air role. Using APKWS II as an air-to-air weapon 'is a lower-cost option compared to the AIM-9X. That lower cost is one of the benefits of using it,' a U.S. military official told TWZ. A current generation Block II subvariant of the AIM-9X Sidewinder has a unit price of just under $420,000, according to Pentagon budget documents. The price of a single AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), which U.S. forces have also been employing in operations against the Houthis, is more than $1 million. In contrast, an APKWS II rocket's unit cost, depending on how it is configured, is in the low tens of thousands of dollars. While we don't know what unit cost the Air Force is targeting for ERAM, other broadly similar efforts in progress elsewhere within the U.S. military and private industry have been eyeing price points around $300,000. F-16s armed with a mixture of AIM-9X, AIM-9M, and AIM-120 missiles flying somewhere over the Middle East in January 2025. The jet at the rear also has a seven-shot 70mm rocket pod. USAF Given what is known about the baseline ERAM design, an air-to-air version would likely be limited to employment against lower-performance and less reactive targets flying along steady flight paths, as is also the case with APKWS II in this role. At the same time, with a range of 250 miles, an air-to-air interceptor version of the ERAM would have dramatically greater reach than the laser-guided rockets, or even traditional medium-range air-to-air missiles like the AIM-120. Networked kill webs feeding in targeting data from offboard sources would be essential for prosecuting engagements at these ranges. A US Air Force F-16 fires an AIM-120 missile. USAF A 250-mile range would also translate to endurance for an ERAM interceptor to potentially function as a loitering air-to-air weapon. Such a munition could be fired into forward areas where drones and other slower and less maneuverable targets are known to be or expected to pass through. Depending on its guidance package, it might be able to then spot and attempt to intercept those threats automatically. This, in turn, would present complications for enemy forces, as well as an additional stand-off layer of defense against incoming threats. The U.S. military already has surface-to-air interceptors with degrees of loitering capability in service in the form of Raytheon's Coyote Block 2 and Anduril's Roadrunner-M, the latter of which is also fully reusable if it is not expended. Their performance differs substantially from what an air-to-air version of ERAM could offer. Loitering air defense interceptors are emerging elsewhere globally, as well. Whatever its exact capabilities, an air-to-air version of ERAM could still be a valuable addition to a mix of future air-to-air capabilities, which might also be adaptable for launch from launchers on ground-based or maritime platforms. As the Eglin spokesperson highlighted, FALCO, or technologies used in it, could find their way onto other weapon systems, as well. All of this aligns with broader U.S. military-wide efforts to find ways to accelerate not just the development of new munitions and other capabilities, but also their production at useful scales. Having additional lower-cost munition options in the mix, in general, could also help alleviate strains on stockpiles of more exquisite munitions. Operations against, the Houthis, as well as in the defense of Israel, since October 2023, together with recent obligations to allies and partners, especially Ukraine, have prompted serious criticisms and concerns about the adequacy of key U.S. munitions inventories and the ability to replenish them, especially in a future high-fight, such as one in the Pacific against China. The Air Force is hardly alone in facing these realities and using a highly modular ERAM design to develop a diverse family of munitions capable of engaging targets on land, at sea, and in the air, could easily be of interest elsewhere within the U.S. military, as well as outside of the United States. As noted, the ERAM program has been primarily focused from the start on delivering a valuable new precision air-to-ground munition capability to Ukraine's military, which also regularly faces down waves of incoming Russian kamikaze drones and cruise missiles. Overall, the details that continue to emerge about ERAM, including now the possibility of using FALCO to turn it into an air-to-air weapon, steadily point to a program with the potential to have broad ramifications for U.S. military 'weaponeering' efforts going forward.

Our Best Look Yet At Britain’s New Dreadnought Class Ballistic Mi...	A detailed model has provided what’s likely our best idea of how the U.K. Royal Navy’s new Dreadnought class nuclear ballistic submarine, or SSBN will appear. The four Dreadnought boats represent one of the most important U.K. defense programs in many years and it’s notable to see how many advanced features the design includes, as the Royal Navy seeks to find the optimum balance between speed, stealth, and incredibly destructive firepower. The four new SSBNs (known as ‘bombers’ in British parlance) will replace the Vanguard class that entered service in the 1990s. The impressive model of how the new Dreadnought is expected to look was presented recently at the U.K. House of Commons, as part of Rolls-Royce’s nuclear portfolio demonstration during the government’s 'Nuclear Week in Parliament.' A photo of the model from that event was subsequently published by the company on LinkedIn and appears at the top of this story. Rolls-Royce is responsible for designing and supplying the Pressurised Water Reactor 3 (PWR3) nuclear propulsion plant for the Dreadnought. A previous artist’s impression of the Dreadnought class submarine. BAE Systems In the past, the Royal Navy and the submarine’s manufacturer BAE Systems have published artists’ concepts of the SSBN, like the one above, but they have generally lacked this level of detail. The Royal Navy has, however, already published limited specifications for the boat, which include a displacement of 17,200 tonnes (18,600 tons) and a length of 153.6 meters (504 feet). As well as the overall highly streamlined hull form, the SSBN features a notably low-profile, raked sail, something that is increasingly common in modern submarine designs. Some designs have gone further still, replacing the previous tower-like sail with just a small fairing, as seen on the small Chinese submarine that appeared in 2019. Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy is looking at the possibility of having its future nuclear attack submarines fitted with non-traditional sails, including ones that are inflatable, popping up when required, but otherwise concealed to preserve the submarine’s speed, maneuverability, and acoustic stealth. The sail on the Dreadnought class is a less radical approach, but it clearly reflects the move toward smaller sails, driven by these requirements. On the model, the sail is topped with at least three periscopes and sensor masts. An infographic for the future Dreadnought class SSBN. BAE Systems A relatively small pair of diving planes are installed in the sides of the hull, in a location immediately ahead of the sail. In front of the sail, on the top of the hull, there appears to be a post-like structure, which may well be an intercept sonar, as found in a similar location on British nuclear-powered attack submarines. The new model provides what’s probably the best visual indication of how the SSBN’s submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) will be configured within the hull, which has five deck levels. Compared with previous SSBN designs, the Dreadnought class also has a notably low-profile missile compartment aft of the sail. Rather than projecting out of the hull in a box-like fashion, as on some earlier SSBN designs, this area actually appears to be somewhat sunken into the hull. The missile section is actually divided into three separate missile compartments, each one comprising four missile tubes (known as a ‘quad pack’), for a total of 12 tubes. The previous Vanguard class SSBNs have 16 missile tubes, but in practice, only eight are carried on patrols, to comply with treaty regulations. HMS Vengeance returning to HMNB Clyde, after completing Operational Sea Training. HMS Vengeance is the fourth and final Vanguard class submarine of the Royal Navy. Crown Copyright POA(Phot) Tam McDonald The U.K. Ministry of Defense has also said in the past that only eight of the 12 tubes on each Dreadnought class will be operational, with the other four being filled with ballast to ensure the boat remains stable. The reasoning behind the reduction in total missile tubes is not entirely clear but reflects a similar trend in the United States. The U.S. Navy’s new Columbia class SSBNs will have 16 missile tubes, compared to 24 on the previous Ohio class SSBNs. However, four of the tubes on each of the Ohio boats were deactivated as a result of arms control agreements with Russia. Like the Vanguard class SSBNs that they will be replacing, the Dreadnought class will be capable of launching Trident 2 D5 missiles. A maximum of 40 warheads is currently carried on board the Royal Navy SSBNs when on deterrent patrol, each Trident missile being able to carry multiple warheads, or multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRVs). While each Trident can theoretically carry 14 MIRVs, depending on the type, 40 warheads on each patrol amount to approximately five per missile, although how the warheads can be spread across the missiles is variable. Currently, the Vanguard class SSBNs go to sea with Trident armed with a version of the U.S. W76 warhead, which dates back to the 1970s and is known locally as the Mk 4/A. For the Dreadnought class, the United Kingdom is developing the new A21 nuclear warhead. The A21 was previously known publicly simply as the Replacement Warhead Program and is also now called Astraea; you can read more about it and its progress here. Personnel at the Pantex plant in Texas load a Mk 4A reentry vehicle containing a W76-1 warhead into a container for transport. The W76-2 warhead fits inside the same reentry vehicle. NNSA The Astraea is being developed in parallel with the U.S. W93, which is expected to begin entering service in the 2030s, and the former may well be derived, at least in part, from the latter. Other armaments for the Dreadnought class submarines will include Spearfish heavyweight medium-range torpedoes, which will be launched from four 533mm torpedo tubes in the front of the hull.

The pumpjet propulsor is designed to reduce the noise of the submarine, especially at high speeds. According to the Royal Navy, the Dreadnought class will be its quietest submarine yet and will be able to achieve a maximum speed of at least 20 knots. Its actual top speed will almost certainly be higher than this, with submarine performance figures generally being shrouded in secrecy. Generally speaking, pumpjets offer various advantages over propellers, above all the ability to reach higher speeds without noisy cavitation — this means they can transit long distances around much more stealthily. Pumpjets are also more efficient across most of a submarine’s performance envelope and have particular advantages in shallow water. On the other hand, they are also heavy, costlier, and more complex than a propeller. The Royal Navy’s Astute class is also equipped with a pumpjet. Crown Copyright Immediately ahead of the propulsor are the X-form rudders. According to the Royal Navy, 'Whereas previous submarines have used traditional rudders due to their speed and the depths at which they operate, improvements in control and safety now allow for X-form rudders.' As we have discussed in the past, an X-shaped stern configuration provides improved maneuverability, efficiency, and safety, and also helps reduce the acoustic signature across significant parts of the submarine’s operating envelope compared to the more traditional cruciform system. The X-shaped stern configuration has become increasingly popular and is now found on other submarine designs around the globe, including the U.S. Navy’s new SSBN, the Columbia class. However, while the fins on the U.S. design are staggered, with the two upper ones being mounted slightly further forward, those on the Dreadnought class are, according to the model, all mounted at the same position on the length of the hull. Not obvious from the model, the Dreadnought class will accommodate 130 crew members, including three chefs, and one doctor. For the first time in a Royal Navy submarine, the boats will also feature separate female crew quarters, toilets, and washing facilities. The accommodation unit from the first-of-class Dreadnought submarine. BAE Systems The Dreadnought class is scheduled to enter service starting in the early 2030s and the estimated total program cost of around $43 billion makes it by far the most expensive single U.K. defense program — this figure notably doesn’t include the cost of replacing the warheads for the Trident missiles. The Dreadnought class is a very powerful expression of British military capability, putting it in an elite group of nuclear-armed nations. The program is also at the center of a warship-building program that should see the Royal Navy receive 28 warships and submarines, including the new Type 26 and Type 31 frigates, the Astute class attack submarines, as well as new Fleet Solid Support ships and Multi-Role Support Ships (MRSS), a new class of amphibious warfare vessels. This, in turn, is all part of a new-look military strategy, which includes a commitment to increase defense spending to 2.5 percent of national wealth by 2030. Production of the Dreadnought class will take place at BAE Systems’ complex in Barrow-in-Furness, in the northeast of England, once work on the sven-strong Astute class is completed. The BAE’s construction facility will undergo an upgrade costing hundreds of millions of dollars, which includes an enlargement that will allow it to build the Dreadnought class. In October last year, a 'significant' fire took place at the Devonshire Dock Hall (DDH) building in Barrow-in-Furness, as we reported at the time, although there are no reports that it will affect the timeline for the Dreadnought class builds. Astutes under construction at BAE Systems’ Devonshire Dock Hall located in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, England. BAE Systems While we will have to wait a bit longer to see the first of the Dreadnought class taking shape at Barrow-in-Furness, the latest model presented by Rolls-Royce provides us with what’s probably the most useful indication so far of the appearance of the Royal Navy’s next nuclear ballistic submarine.

Ex-Military Helicopter Pilots Explain The Challenges Of Flying Ov...	The skies over Washington D.C., where an Army Black Hawk helicopter collided with a passenger airliner Wednesday night, killing 67, is the most tightly controlled and surveilled airspace open to civilian air traffic in the United States. As such, it can be a hazardous place to be airborne, particularly at night, when bedrock principles of good airmanship can fall by the wayside and helicopter and air traffic control personnel can get overwhelmed, current and former military helicopter pilots told TWZ Thursday. The collision killed the three soldiers aboard the UH-60 helicopter, as well as 64 aboard the PSA Airlines Bombardier CRJ700 regional jet, which was on its final approach to Ronald Reagan National Airport shortly before 9 p.m. when the accident occurred over the Potomac River.

Szypula (@Bubblebathgirl) January 30, 2025 It happened as the inbound airliner from Wichita, Kansas, made its visual approach to Reagan’s Runway 33. The PSA flight was operating as Flight 5342 for American Airlines. Go here to read our ongoing coverage of the tragedy. Multiple investigations have been launched into the incident. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, echoing President Donald Trump, said Thursday that 'there was some sort of elevation issue' with the Fort Belvoir, Virginia, based Black Hawk that the Army was investigating. Update on Guantanamo Bay Operations and @SecDef Hegseth Addresses Tragic Mishap Involving US Army Helicopter pic.twitter.com/80J5djB4oP&mdash; Department of Defense (@DeptofDefense) January 30, 2025 Beyond that, it remains anybody’s guess as to how a mishap of this magnitude could have happened. But helicopter pilots who spoke with TWZ shared their thoughts on what would have complicated the sky over the Potomac Wednesday night. The jet was close to landing at Reagan, and therefore, 'to be a couple hundred feet above the Potomac there is not unusual,' said Dr. Michael Canders, a retired Air Force and Navy helicopter pilot who has also worked as a commercial airline pilot and has flown over the capital both in and out of uniform. 'You’ve got helicopters operating along the Potomac River, and I think the [height restriction] is 200 feet,' Canders, now an aviation professor at Farmingdale College in New York State, told TWZ Thursday. 'When they are in the vicinity of the airport, they have to be especially vigilant. It’s not that unusual for this combination of traffic to occur.' As such, awareness of other aircraft is key, he said, and helicopter pilots should always be aware of airliners on such a northwest heading for runway 33. Officials have yet to say what altitude the helicopter and passenger jet were at when they collided. A map of Ronald Reagan National Airport and the surrounding airspace. The blue lines signify helicopter routes. (FAA) 'If you’re going to fly past, make sure you remain clear and under it, so you don’t impact or interfere with any aircraft,' Canders said. Jets fly on very specific approaches, and helicopter routes are designed with that in mind, which makes the collision’s causes that much more unclear, Tom Longo, a retired Marine Corps CH-53E pilot who once helped plan President Barack Obama’s helicopter flights as part of Marine Helicopter Squadron 1, told TWZ. '[Helicopter] routes were designed to go under jets,' Longo said. 'There’s deconfliction built into this, if you stay on the route and do what you’re supposed to.' Tom Longo during his flying days for the Marine Corps. (Tom Longo) 'The glide slope going into the airport for the airplane shouldn't intercept the helicopter route,' he added, likening such flights to highway travel. 'You’re going 55 mph, someone else is going 55 mph in the other direction, but if you stay on the highway, it’s not that hard,' Longo said. 'It’s not that hard until you start freelancing.' Key questions:1.) Does the helicopter route, including its max altitude block, intercept the glideslope or very near to it for Runway 33?2A.) If yes, why does this exist and why wasn't there extreme vigilance to deconflict aircraft when 33 is in use?2B.) If no, was the…&mdash; Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) January 30, 2025 While not inclined to speculate on the mishap’s cause, Canders said the helicopter crew may have not followed a basic pilot mantra. 'It’s called ‘see and avoid,’' he said, 'and it’s as simple as it sounds.' See and avoid basically entails making sure that a pilot maintains visual situational awareness of the skies around their aircraft, precisely to avoid the type of collision that happened Wednesday. Michael Canders in his military days. (Michael Canders) 'Were there factors that contributed to maybe an inability to see and avoid? That’s what the investigators will try to determine,' he added. 'That’s the key question, why wasn’t see and avoid complied with?' Despite modern technology, flying at night remains 'significantly' harder than day flying, Canders said. 'Both of them are hard to see [at night] because the only thing you’re going to typically see are some lights,' Canders said. 'You’ll see what they call the position lights and anti-collision lights, but when they’re interfered with, or when they’re among the ground lighting, it’s not always easy to pick out how far away they are, how fast they're going, so that’s the challenge of night flying. It’s really a different kind of world.'

Such systems include TCAS in airliners and the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) in a helicopter’s cockpit display. Earlier Thursday, TWZ laid out what TCAS can and cannot do. 'But there’s a little bit of lag on that technology, on those electronics,' he said. 'So back to looking outside, you’re definitely going to be able to determine, am I on a collision course with that, although it is harder at night and pilots are often drawn inside. They want to look at the display.' Canders flew a derivative of the Black Hawk used for Air Force rescue missions known as the HH-60G Pave Hawk, and he recalled flying that low-level route over the Potomac. An Air Force HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopter. (U.S. Air Force) 'It tends to be busy there,' he said. 'So it’s back to see and avoid, and always having your head on a swivel, looking outside and making sure that you’re not going to run into another [aircraft].' Still, Canders said the skies over Washington aren’t any more difficult to fly through than similarly busy skies in New York City or other major metropolitan areas. But staying below 200 feet is critical, or pilots risk losing their licenses. 'If you were flying formation, the last guy in the formation would have to work pretty hard to maintain not exceeding the altitude, and you’d have to bug the guy in the front, like, you got to go lower,' Longo, who retired in 2012, told TWZ. 'It wasn’t hard as much as it felt you weren’t used to it. Typically when you fly around the cities, you would fly high, not to bug people. This seemed like you have to do the opposite.' Meanwhile, some military pilots have noted online that aircraft have so much to track, and can get easily distracted, despite how common it is to have helicopters flying in and around major airports like Reagan. Helicopters operating in and around major airports is very common. In the United States, the FAA publishes prescribed routes and altitudes for helicopters in 8 major cities across the United States, I have flown almost all the routes in a helicopter mostly at night in over 7 of… pic.twitter.com/tc58sIr0nK&mdash; Thenewarea51 (@thenewarea51) January 30, 2025 'You are operating a complex aircraft in a complex environment and you can get task saturated even with a two-pilot crew,' like that aboard the Black Hawk, @Thenewarea51, a career helicopter pilot and friend of the site, wrote on X Thursday. He added that 'task saturation also can happen to the most experienced air traffic controller.' In such circumstances, see and avoid can understandably become harder to execute. '[Air traffic control] may call out traffic and you confirm that you have it in sight, or maybe you spot the wrong aircraft,' the pilot wrote. 'It takes one little thing to happen to lose sight of that traffic in question, e.g., a light flashes on your instrument panel, the person sitting next to you or behind you asks a question, you have multiple radios that you are listening to, you spot a bird, and the list goes on and on.' To that pilot, pressing questions include whether the Black Hawk pilots were wearing night vision googles (NVG), which provide around a 40-degree field of view. The pilot also wondered if the helicopter identified the correct aircraft and assured the air traffic control that they had it in sight and would maintain visual separation.

'It’s a mind boggling amount of data to digest even for a pilot or control with thousands of hours of experience.' Canders noted that, if the Black Hawk’s crew had realized it was in the path of the airliner sooner, it could have taken evasive measures and been out of the jet’s way in about five seconds. Less than a day after the mishap, Longo is convinced someone made a mistake, but he’s not sure who was ultimately responsible. Army Black Hawk helicopters fly over Washington, D.C. (U.S. Army) '[Was the helicopter] off course? Was the airplane off course?' he asked. 'And you can’t do this without talking to the [air traffic control] tower, so the tower would have cleared them through. There’s at least three choices … I’m sure everyone thought that he or she was doing the right thing, but one of the three erred.' As the saying goes, military regulations are written in blood. New policies are often enacted after older policies lead to loss of life. As the Army, the National Transportation Safety Board and other federal agencies dive into what went wrong Wednesday night, what caused this tragedy remains to be unveiled, as does the question of what could have been done to prevent the loss of those 67 souls.

Mid-Air Collision Shines Light On Doomsday Plans For Nation’s Cap...	The crew of a U.S. Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter involved in a mid-air collision over the Potomac River last night were training for what is known as a continuity of government mission. In the event of a major attack or other especially serious crisis, Army helicopters would be among the assets tasked with spiriting senior U.S. officials and lawmakers safely out of Washington, D.C. at a moment's notice so that critical aspects of the country's government continue to function. Readers can get up to speed on the tragic accident near Reagan International Airport in TWZ's previous reporting here. A 12th Aviation Battalion UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter flies past the Pentagon. US Army 'We're going to get to the bottom of this. We, first and foremost, from the Defense Department, want to pass our condolences to the 64 souls and their families [onboard American Airlines Flight 5342] that were affected by this. &#8230; and certainly the three service members, the three soldiers, a young captain, a staff sergeant, and a CW2 – Chief Warrant Officer,' Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said a press conference at the White House today. The Army personnel were 'on a routine annual retraining of night flights on a standard corridor for continuity of government mission.' 'The Army unit involved was Bravo Company, 12th Aviation Battalion, at Fort Belvoir,' Hegseth also said in an earlier recorded statement. 'It was an annual proficiency training flight. &#8230; It was a fairly experienced crew that was doing a required annual night evaluation. They did have night vision goggles.'

The battalion has a fleet of specially configured VH-60 helicopters with modified main cabins and distinctive black-and-gold paint jobs, and that are commonly referred to as 'gold tops,' to support that mission. A 'gold top' VH-60 assigned to the 12th Aviation Battalion flies over Washington, D.C. US Army The 12th also standard green-painted UH-60s, as well as UH-72 Lakota light utility helicopters, which are on call to provide a variety of additional airlift capacity, including in support of civilian agencies, as required. The battalion is notably on call to shuttle around the Army's unique 911th Engineer Company (Technical Rescue), the service’s premier urban search and rescue unit. The 911th, then known as the Military District of Washington (MDW) Engineer Company, came to particular prominence for its part in the response to the 9/11 terrorist attack on the Pentagon. Lastly, the 12th Aviation Battalion has its continuity of government mission, which is not a secret, but is also not well known or often publicized. The are continuity of government plans across the whole of the U.S. government to help ensure that key authorities can continue to perform their duties even in the worst of scenarios, as you can read more about here. '12th Aviation [Battalion] obviously has a special mission set in the National Capital Region,' Jonathan Koziol, a subject matter expert and retired Army aviator now working for the Aviation Directorate Chief of Staff within the Department of the Army's top headquarters at the Pentagon, told TWZ and other reporters during a press call today. 'Part of it is VIP flights for our senior leaders throughout the service to get them to and from certain areas,' Koziol continued. 'But partly, some of their mission is to support the Department of Defense if something really bad happens in this area and we need to move our senior leaders.' In the event of a major attack, or warning of an imminent one, as well as natural disasters and other similarly severe crises, the 12th Aviation Battalion's helicopters could be tasked with flying senior U.S. officials and lawmakers from locations like the Pentagon, Capitol Building, and White House to more secure sites in the region. These include Camp David, Mount Weather, and Raven Rock. Many continuity of government sites remain classified. The flights could come at any time, including in the dead of night, and, depending on the circumstances, might face a host of other complex environmental factors and other challenging conditions. Power outages could put additional emphasis on the need to use night vision goggles, which impose limits on situational awareness. Attacks involving nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons would prompt the need to wear other bulky protective gear. In the outright rush to evacuate key personnel, the airspace would be filled with large numbers aircraft, as highlighted by large COG exercises the 12th Aviation Battalion regularly conducts involving dozens of its helicopters. 12th Aviation Battalion UH-60s, as well as a UH-72 closest to the camera, during a larger scale exercise. US Army Army helicopters would not be alone in performing these flights if continuity of government plans were put into motion. The U.S. Air Force's 1st Helicopter Squadron with its UH-1N Huey helicopters at Andrews Air Force Base just outside Washington has a continuity of government mission, as well. Publicly available air traffic control audio recordings indicate that two Air Force UH-1Ns were also in the air when the mid-air collision occurred last night. Whether or not they were training together with the Army UH-60 at the time is unknown. UH-1Ns from the 1st Helicopter Squadron prepare to land on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., during a training exercise in 2023. USAF Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), headquartered further to the south at Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia, would also receive continuity of government taskings in a crisis. HMX-1's 'White Top' fleet of VH-3Ds, VH-60Ns, and now VH-92s are primarily used as 'Marine One' helicopters to move the president, their family, and their closest advisors around at home and abroad. The unit also has a 'green top' fleet, the bulk of which currently consists of MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotors, to provide additional VIP and other airlift support. HMX-1 usually has some of its aircraft staged at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling, which is situated in close proximity to the National Mall. They would be among the fastest to respond in a crisis, primarily to pluck the President, Vice President, and key aids to safety. Former President Joe Biden disembarks from a VH-92, HMX-1's newest type of presidential helicopter. BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images Back in 2019, Bloomberg also reported that Army UH-60 helicopters had a new classified mission around Washington, D.C., but what exactly that entailed remains unknown. Whether or not that mission has changed since then, or is even still ongoing, is not known, either. Law enforcement and other civilian agencies are part of continuity of government planning, too. Organizations with helicopters, such as the U.S. Park Police, as well as police forces in the states surrounding the capital, would support airlift operations, as well. For pilots and other aircrew assigned to the 12th Aviation Battalion, it is especially important 'to be able to understand the environment, the air traffic, the route, and ensure the safe travel of our senior leaders throughout our government,' Koziol, the subject matter expert at the Army's headquarters at the Pentagon, stressed. 'And that's part of their training here, and they're really good at it. These are our top pilots doing this mission in the National Capital Region.' In the past, TWZ has highlighted the importance of helicopter training sorties, including ones conducted at extremely low levels, and other military training in and around real urban environments. The nuances found in actual cities, as well as along the way to and from objectives within them, cannot be directly replicated at dedicated training sites. At the same time, these kinds of training missions demand significant safety precautions and other coordination with relevant authorities. The airspace around Washington, D.C., which is the most densely defended and heavily monitored in the United States, not to mention very busy, presents additional unique challenges. There are complex helicopter routes, as well as various rules and regulations, all of which have to be adhered to very closely, and that are important to train around. This is especially so in the general area where the collision occurred last night, as you can read more about here. How Army training procedures, as well as other policies, rules, and regulations, might change in the wake of the collision last night remains to be seen. Any changes will have to be balanced against the real needs of military aviation units like the 12th Aviation Battalion to be prepared to perform its unique continuity of government mission, as well as their other duties, around the nation's capital.

‘Elevation Issue’ With UH-60 That Collided With CRJ700 Over Potom...	Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Thursday that 'there was some sort of elevation issue' with the Army Black Hawk helicopter that collided in mid-air with a passenger airliner Wednesday night over the Potomac River that is now being investigated. He also confirmed at a press conference that the Black Hawk was in the midst of a so-called 'continuity of government' training mission. Continuity of government missions would generally involve the rapid movement of government leaders in the event of an emergency that threatens the functioning of government. Neither Hegseth nor President Donald Trump provided further details on what that training mission entailed. Update on Guantanamo Bay Operations and @SecDef Hegseth Addresses Tragic Mishap Involving US Army Helicopter pic.twitter.com/80J5djB4oP&mdash; Department of Defense (@DeptofDefense) January 30, 2025 The collision killed the three soldiers aboard the UH-60 helicopter, as well as 64 aboard the PSA Airlines Bombardier CRJ700 regional jet, which was on its final approach to Ronald Reagan National Airport at the time. Investigations into the fatal accident are being conducted by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the Pentagon and the U.S. Army. Shortly before 9 p.m. last night, the airliner, inbound from Wichita, Kansas, collided in midair with the Black Hawk helicopter while on approach to Runway 33, the FAA stated. The PSA flight was operating as Flight 5342 for American Airlines. You can catch up with what happened in our initial story here. The Black Hawk was assigned to Bravo Company of the 12th Aviation Battalion out of Fort Belvoir, Virginia, Hegseth said, adding in a video posted to X Thursday that the helicopter was manned by a 'fairly experienced crew that was doing a required annual night evaluation.' The crew did have night vision goggles, he added. It is unclear at the moment whether the flight crew was wearing those goggles at the time. While illuminating the dark, they also limit the field of vision, potentially diminishing the pilots’ situational awareness. That will likely be a key data point investigators will consider in determining the cause of this crash. 'We anticipate that the investigation will quickly be able to determine whether the aircraft was in the corridor at the right altitude at the time of the incident,' he said. The airliner 'was doing everything right' before the collision, using the same track as other passenger planes use, Trump told reporters at Thursday's press conference. But for reasons that remain unclear less than 24 hours after the crash, the Black Hawk was 'pretty much at the same height' as the plane's path and was 'going at an angle that was unbelievably bad,' Trump said. He also noted that multiple investigations are ongoing into the incident that will get to the bottom of what transpired. Turning to the crash itself, Donald Trump appears to speculate on what happened, saying the passenger plane was 'doing everything right' and 'coming into path'. He says a 'confluence of bad decisions' caused the crash. Sky 501 pic.twitter.com/3MJ2XMjnu8&mdash; Sky News (@SkyNews) January 30, 2025 Meanwhile, the Army has paused 12th Aviation Battalion flights for 48 hours while senior officials review the incident, Hegseth said. Unified command for this incident has shifted to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which will be leading the investigation, Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said at a Thursday morning press conference. Few other details have been released regarding what caused the collision. 'Obviously it is not standard to have aircraft collide,' U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told reporters. 'I want to be clear on that. But prior to the collision the flight paths that were being flown from the military and from American, that was not unusual for what happens in the DC air space. And as this investigation moves forward, we will be able to provide more information to you about the details.' 'At this time, we don’t know why the military aircraft came into the path of the PSA aircraft,' said American Airlines CEO Robert Eisen. 'These are experienced pilots. I know that the captain had almost six years with PSA, the first officer almost two years.'

'It's an accident that seems to be preventable, from what we can tell it today,' Driscoll said of the disaster when asked by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen how Army will keep military training flights out of harm's way, according to a CBS News Tweet. 'There are appropriate times to take risk and there are inappropriate times to take risk.

'U.S. Figure Skating, the organization that serves as the sport's national governing body, confirmed the plane's passengers included several of its members, who had attended a prestigious training camp for novice and intermediate skaters in Wichita, Kansas, where the flight took off,' CBS News reported. 'These athletes, coaches, and family members were returning home from the National Development Camp held in conjunction with the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita, Kansas,' U.S. Figure Skating said in a statement, the news outlet stated. 'We are devastated by this unspeakable tragedy and hold the victims' families closely in our hearts. We will continue to monitor the situation and will release more information as it becomes available.' While Trump and Hegseth have made their initial statements, the coming days will provide a fuller picture about what happened and how it will be prevented from happening again.

Here’s What Air Traffic Collision Avoidance Systems Can And Can’t...	Yesterday’s tragic mid-air collision between an American Eagle Bombardier CRJ-700 regional jetliner and a U.S. Army H-60 Black Hawk helicopter close to Reagan National Airport, near Washington, D.C., has led to many questions about the role played by the Traffic Collision Avoidance System, or TCAS. While you can read our report of the incident here, it should be restated that, at this early stage we have no clue as to exactly what might have gone wrong. In the meantime, however, it’s worth looking at TCAS in more detail, and, especially, what it can and can’t do to prevent mid-air collisions. A screen grab captured from a video shows an American Eagle CRJ-700 colliding in midair with a U.S. Army H-60 Black Hawk helicopter, after which it crashed into the Potomac River in Washington, D.C. United States on January 29, 2025. Photo by Kennedy Center Cam/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu Fundamentally, TCAS exists to help maintain separation between aircraft while they are flying. According to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which regulates international air transport, aircraft need a minimum of 1,000 feet of vertical separation at the point at which their paths cross, provided they are flying at 29,000 feet or below, under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR). Flying above 29,000 feet, the separation requirement increases to 2,000 feet or greater, although there are some exceptions, in specific busy air corridors. A video showing TCAS training produces in an Airbus A320 simulator: For the most part, the responsibility for ensuring this vertical separation — and therefore removing the chance of a collision — falls upon the relevant air traffic control authorities and, in some cases, the aircrew. TCAS exists, above all, as a backup to this, providing the aircraft crew with a warning that is independent of aircraft navigation equipment and ground-based systems. TCAS emerged from the lessons learned from a much earlier fatal collision, the 1956 accident involving a United Airlines Douglas DC-7 and a Trans World Airlines Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation over Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona. This led to an overhaul of how air traffic control was operated in the United States. In particular, there was recognition of the need for a backup collision avoidance system that could operate even if air traffic control failed.

Getty Images Bettmann Early efforts during the late 1950s and early 1960s focused on passive and non-cooperating systems, but over the years, the TCAS concept has been considerably refined, and this collision-avoidance aid is now a fundamental part of aircraft operations not only in the United States but also around the world. A major development in the 1970s concerned the emergence of the Beacon Collision Avoidance System (BCAS), using Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System (ATCRBS) transponders that began to be installed in large numbers of airliners, military aircraft, and also general aviation aircraft. In 1978, the collision between a light aircraft and an airliner over San Diego spurred efforts to refine this technology, leading to TCAS II, the development of which began in 1981. This built on BCAS, providing the same kind of transponder-based interrogation and tracking, but adding some additional capabilities. A video showing a close-up view of the TCAS screen on a Boeing 767-300F during a preflight test: Modern TCAS works using transponder signals from nearby aircraft, meaning it’s independent of air traffic control, but also that it requires aircraft with transponders fitted and switched on in order to function. Using the transponder signals, the system builds a three-dimensional map of the surrounding airspace, with aircraft movements plotted within this. Based on respective aircraft and flight paths, speeds, and altitudes, TCAS then automatically provides the crews with an alert of a possible mid-air collision danger. In some modern airliners, the process of avoiding action will be taken without any pilot action, using a technology known as auto-TCAS.

For various reasons, however, and especially in the case of the collision at Reagan National Airport, TCAS is not a major guarantee of flight safety across all parts of an aircraft’s flight profile. To begin with, the H-60 Black Hawk wouldn’t necessarily have had TCAS fitted to start with, although it is an option for the Black Hawk. ICAO demands that TCAS be fitted to an aircraft that has a capacity of more than 19 passengers or a maximum takeoff weight of more than 5,700 kilograms, but these regulations only cover civil aviation and apply specifically to fixed-wing, turbine-powered aircraft. It’s worth noting that, despite this, TCAS is also found on military aircraft, especially larger ones, such as tankers and transports. An added impetus for this came after the mid-air collision between a German Luftwaffe Tupolev Tu-154 and a U.S. Air Force C-141 StarLifter, off the coast of Namibia in September 1997.

For aircraft operating at lower altitudes, TCAS is inhibited. Specifically, ‘Increase Descent’ warnings are inhibited below 1,550 feet AGL, ‘Descend’ warnings are inhibited below 1,100 feet AGL, and all types of warnings are inhibited below 1,000 feet AGL. Terrain and other obstacles can also interfere with transponder signals during very low-level flight. A visual representation of a hypothetical interaction showing when TCAS will produce a 'traffic advisory' (TA) about the presence of a nearby aircraft, as well as more serious 'resolution advisories' (RA) directing pilots to maneuver to avoid a collision. Eurocontrol via Wikimedia There is a key safety reason behind these limitations, namely that providing warnings at lower altitudes could result in aircraft crews making rapid maneuvers, which could be very dangerous during low and slow flight. For example, a flight crew receiving a ‘Descend’ warning at low level could quickly take action that would end up with the aircraft flying into terrain. In these situations, therefore, TCAS isn’t used to ensure collision avoidance. Initial reports suggest that Flight 5342 and the Black Hawk helicopter collided at an altitude of somewhere between 200 feet and around 400 feet, although this is not confirmed. Moreover, even at flight levels in which TCAS is engaged and is working as intended, the system is not foolproof. In one tragic example, in 2002, a Tupolev Tu-154 and a Boeing 757 collided over southwest Germany, killing 71. An investigation found that, although they received TCAS warnings, the crew of the Tu-154 relied instead on contradictory instructions from air traffic control, leading to a collision.

Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images Sean Gallup There have also been incidents of mid-air collision in recent years in which TCAS has not provided warnings since one or more of the aircraft involved were flying without their transponders activated. Since the accident yesterday, there’s been much speculation about what might have exactly happened and questions have been asked about whether TCAS could have prevented it. Again, we really have no idea at this point what happened or what role TCAS did or didn’t play. Regardless, even when aircraft are fitted with fully functional Traffic Collision Avoidance Systems, these will not necessarily prevent or even warn of a mid-air collision, especially at low altitude. In the meantime, we will have to await more official information before we can better understand what might have gone wrong.

Carrier Air Wing’s Key Priorities To Win In Future Pacific Fight ...	U.S. Navy officials have laid out several priorities they say are key to ensuring the service's carrier air wings will be able to succeed in future conflicts, especially a high-end fight in the Pacific. The MQ-25 Stingray tanker drone, which will help provide critical range extension and persistence for other aircraft, is the centerpiece of those efforts. New long-range weapons, advanced platforms that can penetrate deep into dense enemy air defense environments, and robust networks to support the kill chains that underpin all of this are also essential to the Navy's current carrier-based airpower vision. Navy officers talked about the service's carrier fleets and their air wings during a panel discussion, which TWZ attended, earlier today at the WEST 2025 conference. 'MQ-25, plus long-range weapons and kill chains, plus a robust command and control, and platforms that can gain access to contested environments, are the vision and the key to the future of the carrier air wing to be able to operate out in the Pacific,' Capt. Lew Callaway, head of the Strike Aircraft and Weapons Branch within the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations' Air Warfare Division, said. 'I want to pivot to the MQ-25 because it's the nearest, most important capability that we're going to field in order to extend the range and the persistence of the carrier air wing.' Extending the reach of other aircraft in carrier air wing, as well as eliminating the need to use crewed F/A-18F Super Hornets in the tanker role, are the stated primary missions for the MQ-25. The Stingrays will also have a secondary intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capability. Though not mentioned explicitly during today's panel at WEST 2025 there has also been talk about using the MQ-25, or future variants thereof, as a carrier-based standoff strike platform. Range and persistence have long been important considerations for carrier aviation operations, but are increasingly more so as threat air defense ecosystems grow. In addition to the growing risks they present to carrier-based aircraft, work by potential adversaries like China to expand their air defenses, as well as long-range strike capabilities, could easily limit access to land-based tankers that Navy carrier air wings, especially their shorter-legged tactical jets, often rely on today. The availability of bases on the ground, or lack thereof, could put further constraints on traditional aerial refueling support, especially during operations across the broad expanses of the Pacific. Last year, the Navy notably put out a contracting notice expressing interest in options for extending the unrefueled range of its F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighters and EA-18G Growler electronic warfare jets. In recent years, the service has also been fielding E-2D Hawkeye airborne early warning and control aircraft with new inflight refueling capability. The MQ-25 program has been beset by delays and cost growth for years now. Navy Vice Adm. Daniel Cheever, the Air Force's top aviation officer, said separately at WEST 2025 that the service expects the first production representative Stingray to make its maiden flight before the end of this year and to fly from the deck of an actual carrier in 2026, according to Breaking Defense. Various ground and flight testing has already occurred using a demonstrator drone and the Navy has been otherwise working to lay the groundwork for the Stingray's arrival. This includes the integration of new dedicated uncrewed aviation control centers on its carriers, which the service has made clear will be able to support additional pilotless platforms in the future. 'One of the primary goals of MQ-25 is just going to be, for the first time, to integrate unmanned aviation into the air plan, into the day-to-day [operational tempo], so it just becomes second nature,' Capt. Lew said today. 'And we're going to take a sequential mindset when it comes to follow-on unmanned vehicles.' 'MQ-25 is absolutely the Navy's push to make sure that we have demonstrated you can take an unmanned platform and put it on a carrier, but demonstration is way different than operating every single day,' Rear Adm. Keith Hash, head of the Naval Air Warfare Center's Weapons Division and another one of the panelists, added. 'I think we're positioning ourselves so when MQ 25 starts flying this year, gets ready to go to the carrier in the near future, you know, we will make that robust. And when other options come along &#8230; [we] will be ready to accelerate those into the carrier environment [and] into other environments.' The MQ-25 demonstrator drone aboard the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush during testing. USN The Navy has a long-standing goal for its air wings to be up to 60 percent uncrewed in the future. Last year, the service also outlined a vision for a future fleet of lower-cost carrier-capable drones that might even be cheap enough to be optionally expendable, as you can read more about here. In addition, the Navy and the Air Force have a formal agreement to develop common architectures that will allow for the seamless exchange of control of uncrewed platforms between the services during future operations. Work on advanced uncrewed carrier-based aviation capabilities has exploded globally in recent years, as has potential interest in doing so. China is notably pursuing at least one stealthy flying wing-type uncrewed combat air vehicle (UCAV), the GJ-11 Sharp Sword, variants or derivatives of which look increasingly set to fly from at least some of the country's carriers, as well as its new super-sized Type 076 amphibious assault ship. The U.S. military has no known analog to the GJ-11, land or carrier-based, having abandoned similar efforts, including the Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) program that preceded the MQ-25, around a decade ago. The United Kingdom, Turkey, and others are also actively pursuing different tiers of carrier-based drones. A model of a Chinese GJ-11 Sharp Sword flying wing UCAV on display. Yang Suping/VCG via Getty Images For the U.S. Navy, as Capt. Lew noted, drones are only one part of a larger vision for the future of the service's carrier air wings. 'Long range weapons are probably [coming] right after the MQ-25 in time frame,' Lew said. That is a 'capability that gets us access anywhere we want, whether it be in the [Indo-]Pacific Command's AOR [area of responsibility] &#8230; [or] wherever we need to put ordnance on target.' Lew did not elaborate on the munitions or types of munitions in question. Last year, the Navy did formally unveil an air-launched version of its ship-launched multi-purpose SM-6 called the AIM-174B. The service has also said the missile is in at least limited service now with its Super Hornets being the current launch platform. TWZ has previously laid out in detail how the AIM-174B will be an especially key part of countering still expanding Chinese anti-access and area denial capabilities. The Navy is also looking to field air-launched air-breathing hypersonic anti-ship cruise missiles no later than 2029. Future versions of the missile being developed under the Hypersonic Air-Launched Offensive Anti-Surface Warfare (HALO) program could arm the service's ships and submarines. There is the potential for it to be adapted for use against targets on land, as well. The AGM-88G Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile-Extended (AARGM-ER) and the AGM-158C-3 version of the Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) are also set to join the Navy's air-launched arsenal in the coming years. Additional work is ongoing in the classified realm, as well. In terms of penetrating platforms for future carrier air wings, the Navy is pushing ahead with plans for a new sixth-generation crewed stealth combat jet, referred to currently as F/A-XX. The service said last October that it was getting close to picking a winning F/A-XX design and the hope is that the first examples will begin entering service in the 2030s. A rendering of notional U.S. Navy sixth-generation combat jets flying past an aircraft carrier. Boeing F/A-XX is set to replace the F/A-18E/F and the EA-18G, but both of those existing aircraft are currently expected to continue serving into the 2040s. F-35C Joint Strike Fighters, E-2 Hawkeyes, CMV-22 Osprey tilt-rotors, and MH-60 Seahawk helicopters are also set to remain parts of the Navy's carrier air wings for years to come. As the carrier air wing's reach and other capabilities grow, the need for new and improved networking capabilities will only increase. This is something TWZ has explored in-depth in the past. 'We really need to be clear and understanding of the communications and the command and control and the enablers of that long-range kill chain that happens both after you go down the [catapult] shuttle [to launch off the carrier to] after you pull the trigger,' Capt. Lew said. 'We are adjusting and learning and growing and turning inside the circle of those who might bring harm to our folks and to our commerce and lines of communication, and so we're working diligently on setting up our own long-range fires, kill chains, making them robust,' Rear Adm. Hash added. In addition, 'can't get into the details, as you can imagine &#8230; but there's activity along the way to make sure that we can operate in a contested electronic warfare environment, that we have got use of that spectrum, and that we can prevent that spectrum from impacting us, giving us opportunity to surge in and surge out.' Altogether, the Navy's future carrier air wing plans continue to coalesce a vision that has longer reach and greater persistence and that is more uncrewed, lethal, and interconnected than ever before.

Ukraine Discloses New Method To Defeat Russian Fiber-Optic-Contro...	A storied Ukrainian military drone unit said it has developed a way to counter an increasingly deadly weapon — Russian first-person view (FPV) drones that use fiber optic cables instead of radio waves to connect with their controllers, making them impervious to jamming and other forms of electronic warfare. The Magyar Birds Brigade claims it has devised a system using mobile radars to provide early warning for incoming FPV drones several kilometers away. Once they detect the threat, the unit then launches its own drones to intercept the Russian ones before they can reach their targets. '&#8230;the first options for [the] detection and destruction [of Russian FPV fiber optic guided drones] exist and are already being used' by the brigade, claimed its commander, Robert Brovdi, who uses the callsign 'Magyar.' Brovdi posted a video on his Telegram channel purporting to show one of his drones destroying a Russian fiber-optic-guided FPV drone. Notable is the large spool on the back of the Russian drone. It contains an extremely thin but strong wire linking the drone with its controller. This capability has turned an already fearsome weapon into something much harder to defeat. Because their communications are not degraded when flying very low to the ground or even in structures, they can also hunt just feet off the ground and into enclosed areas as long as their data cable stays intact. While Brovdi touts the system, he does not specify what kind of mobile radar his unit is using. It is likely a microwave radar system, like those that operate in Ku-band for counter drone applications. The radar's short wavelength is optimized to sport small, relatively slow-moving drones. The drawback is that they have very limited range measured in just a handful of miles. So these sensors are great for detecting and tracking drones, but they don’t provide much early warning and craft can move in and out of their detection range quickly. Still, if one of these radars can be pushed forward to the front, it could provide critical detection of incoming FPV drones over a defined area and a fix on where a rapidly reacting counter-FPV drone can find it. The Magyar Birds’ system is the latest development in what has become a leap-frogging duel between Ukrainian and Russian FPV drones and countermeasures. As the FPV drones became more prominent on the battlefield, they now rival the importance of traditional artillery. Both sides have also been using drones to take out other drones. This capability first emerged in the skies over Ukraine in October 2022 when a Ukrainian Mavic drone swatted down a Russian one. One of the first such battles was captured in this video you can see below. WW1-style duel.

Amazing!Pls support our Armed Forces: pic.twitter.com/2vaCBQINQK&mdash; Serhiy Prytula (@serhiyprytula) October 13, 2022 Last summer, videos emerged of Ukraine using its FPV drones to take out larger, more expensive Russian surveillance and strike drones. Today, Ukraine has multiple types of drones dedicated to hunting other drones, and Russia is developing and deploying similar systems. You can see one of those encounters in the following video.

While the cables prevent them from being jammed, the extra weight of the large spools needed to operate over long distances slows them down and makes them less maneuverable. That’s something the Magyar Birds noted in the video the unit posted. The size and weight of the spools used on fiber-optic-guided FPV drones make them slower and less maneuverable. (Magyar Birds Screenshot) In his Telegram post, Brovdi urged Ukraine to rush mobile radars capable of detecting small drones to the front lines. 'The army must promptly and massively re-equip with mobile versions of radars every 2-4 km of the front line and with calculations of conventional FPV fighters to destroy enemy FPVs intercepted by mobile radars on fiber optics,' he suggested. These same radars are in extreme demand around the globe as the threat from drones even in peaceful areas explodes. They can even be found on super yachts. These same systems provide awareness of drone activities around military bases and other critical installations, and many of these types of locales still lack them. It’s also worth noting that these sensors, especially commercial grade ones, are vulnerable to detection and attack themselves as their emissions can be detected, triangulated and rapidly targeted. While deploying such sensors on land vehicles, from crewed to uncrewed ones, could help in terms of survivability, these systems will still be highly vulnerable. Given that Ukraine is fighting across a 600-mile front in its own country plus the territory it is battling for in Russia’s Kursk region, it seems at best this could be used as a point-defense system to defend key areas or to help pave the way for limited advances, at least for now. Still, their need points to a near future where advanced counter-drone sensors will be absolutely critical wherever troops are present, and especially on an active battlefield.

Destroyer Has Become First U.S. Navy Ship To Deploy Artificial In...	The Navy destroyer USS Fitzgerald (DDG-62) became the first warship to deploy with a program-of-record artificial intelligence (AI) platform. Its creators say the system will help the fleet predict and tackle maintenance needs in a far less disruptive fashion. The system aims to reduce surprise equipment casualties while ensuring that more of the fleet is available should an all-out war break out, requiring a surge of forces. Known as Enterprise Remote Monitoring Version 4 (ERM v4), the system is the shipboard aspect of a Pentagon program called Condition Based Maintenance Plus, which in part aims to leverage machine learning to help ship crews, ashore commands, logistical nodes, and other units keep more assets ready to fight, Zac Staples, a retired Navy officer whose Austin-based company, Fathom5, created the system, told TWZ Wednesday. Staples spoke at the annual WEST conference in San Diego this week, which TWZ attended, about his company’s innovation before chatting with TWZ. A Navy overview of how Enterprise Remote Monitoring and Condition Based Maintenance work. (U.S. Navy) 'Right now, you’ve got about a third of the Navy that is deployed, a third of the Navy that’s in some depot-level maintenance, very difficult for them to get put back together in surge, but that other third is in various stages of material and training readiness to deploy,' he said. 'Anything, particularly AI, that tells us exactly what we need to do to keep a ship ready before its readiness dips directly contributes to having a much larger battle fleet ready to defend the interests of the nation.' The AI system arrives in the fleet as the Navy continues to suffer severe maintenance delays and readiness issues, even as it races to prepare for a potential war with China. And while the sea service is experimenting with AI in a large variety of ways, Staples said ERM v4 is the first program-of-record platform deployed in such a fashion aboard a Navy ship. It intends to replace the legacy Integrated Condition Assessment System (ICAS), which has been in use since the 1990s, according to the Navy. On the Arleigh Burke class USS Fitzgerald, ERM v4 evaluated about 10,000 sensor readings per second coming from the ship’s hull, mechanical and electrical (HME) systems, with AI algorithms making maintenance recommendations that directly feed into the ship’s maintenance planning system, he said. In one instance, ERM v4’s analysis identified a so-called 'long lead item,' or ship part, that was nearing failure and would take a long time to receive after ordering, Staples said. ERM v4 alerted the crew to the part’s degradation far enough in advance for them to order a replacement and pick it up at the pier, 'to make a repair that, otherwise, probably would have put a particular system out of commission for a bit.' Staples declined to identify the part, deferring to Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), which did not respond to TWZ questions by deadline Wednesday. But according to Staples, ERM v4 gave sailors visibility on an impending failure that they wouldn’t have been aware of otherwise. 'A lot of systems on the ship are operated until failure, then repair or replace,' he said. 'This gave the crew, and then the shoreside maintenance community, visibility of an impending failure, so that the reliability stayed higher.' The Enterprise Remote Monitoring Version 4 (ERM v4) seeks to help sailors better monitor and anticipate parts condition on their ship. (U.S. Navy) Staples likened the evolution of Navy maintenance from an interval to a condition-based system to advances in car oil changes. Previously, drivers were told to just change their oil every 3,000 miles. But newer models monitor mileage, oil viscosity and temperature, and alert the driver when the oil needs to be changed. Navy officials have acknowledged that taking on some precautionary maintenance, instead of waiting for scheduled maintenance times to analyze a ship and make repairs, comprises a sea change in how the service has traditionally handled such work. 'There are numerous challenges, both internally and externally, in front of us as a program,' Mathias Haegele, a mechanical engineer with the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Philadelphia Division, said in 2023 when discussing condition based maintenance. 'Some of the new and innovative products that we are developing and preparing to deploy are going to require a change in culture and how we interact with our end users to encourage engagement, adoption, and continuous feedback.' The system takes up about half a server rack on a ship, Staples said, and it’s changing how sailors read and report system data as well. 'There are still a bunch of systems on the ship that are manually read,' Staples said. 'Today, on most ships, you’ve got sailors going around with clipboards, and they’re writing down pressures and temperatures from manual gauges.' But those readings are critical to feeding AI algorithms accurate data to grow and refine the analytics, so ERM v4 has also involved giving sailors smartphone-like devices to take logs digitally. The USS Fitzgerald (DDG-62) deployed last year with an AI-powered system that helped the crew forecast failing parts in the hull, mechanical and electrical systems of the warship. (U.S. Navy) 'Turns out, they’re much faster at a texting type operation,' Staples said. 'The real difference that a lot of people notice is they shift over to digital log keeping for several of the rounds.' All of ERM v4’s maintenance recommendations are back-checked by shipboard maintenance leadership that confirms those recommendations, Staples said, and Fathom5 and the Naval Surface Warfare Center Philadelphia, the oversight entity for the effort, take in that feedback, which is used to refine the system’s analytic potency. 'That feedback from sailors about the accuracy and relevancy of the recommendations is absolutely vital to this [machine learning] ops vision, where AI is actually reliable and trustable on maintaining things,' he said. ERM v4 is also updated four times a year, which helps create a machine learning loop where models are trained and developed in the cloud, deployed aboard a ship, measured for performance and accuracy and then tuned and redeployed 'in a very quick succession,' Staples said. By comparison, the Submarine Warfare Federated Tactical System (SWFTS), considered the gold standard of continuous update and delivery, is on a two-year cycle, he said. The Navy's Enterprise Remote Monitoring Version 4 (ERM v4) offers updates and delivery every four months, faster than the Submarine Warfare Federated Tactical System's two-year cycle. (U.S. Navy) While ERM v4’s initial use has been in ship engineering maintenance, such condition-based maintenance would be applicable in the future to combat systems, although Staples acknowledged that that would be 'a more complicated place to start the program.' Staples said that ERM v4 will be integrated into the Naval Maintenance Repair and Overhaul (NMRO) system this year, becoming the predictive maintenance and AI layer for that larger logistics and IT portfolio. The system will also deploy four more times in 2025, feeding the AI analytics more data on which to make more refined recommendations. The capability will be getting onto one or two more ships this year, including potentially aboard an amphibious transport dock, he said. 'Then we should see a quick scale, starting in 2026, with a dozen or more ships a year,' Staples said. The Navy has for years wanted to better capture and crunch a ship’s HME data in order to make maintenance less disruptive to a vessel’s operations and general readiness. An earlier ERM system was tested back in 2019, according to a USNI News report, which cited now-retired Rear Adm. Lorin Selby, then NAVSEA’s chief engineer and a proponent of the capability. USNI News noted how previous, larger-scale CBM efforts had led to maintenance availability disruptions: 'During previous attempts at incorporating CBM, there was a thought that, if major efforts like refurbishing tanks were only done when needed, rather than on a predetermined timetable, the Navy could avoid spending time and money on work ahead of need. However, that also meant that shipyards wouldn’t have a clear work package before a ship showed up at the pier, adding uncertainty and, ultimately, more time and cost into the maintenance availability.' A sailor performs corrective scuttle maintenance while working aloft on the mast of the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Sampson. (U.S. Navy) Petty Officer 2nd Class Timothy Meyer 'This time around, Selby sees condition-based maintenance as a way to address smaller maintenance items in such a way that data analysis points a ship crew to components that are experiencing minor performance issues or otherwise showing signs they are about to fail before the failure actually occurs.' While some machine learning has already existed on Navy surface combatants to a lesser degree, particularly within its ever-evolving Aegis Combat System, using a true AI system that was designed from the ground-up, has major benefits. In this case, for keeping ships out to sea and on station. Aside from helping crews spot failing parts faster, a honed AI system for maintenance could also help with logistics and the pre-positioning of certain components before a future degradation is detected. Fleet-wide, it could generally know what parts are more prone to degrade, and when, across numerous classes. It remains unclear how clearly the Navy has captured such data and acted upon in the pre-AI era. Using real time health monitoring and automation to forecast what parts will be needed, and when, has also been a major feature — for better or worse — of the stealthy F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, as well as other new military weapon systems and is becoming a critical requirement for future platforms. The commercial space has also been very bullish on the concept for all types of vehicles and mechanical systems. Enhanced AI agents are thought to only increase just how effective these systems are and how much efficiency can be gained in complex logistics chains that support all kinds of systems. AI and machine learning are moving at a rapid pace, transforming various sectors of society. Having such a system constantly on watch to flag future ship system failures could go a long way to ensuring that Navy ships can carry out their missions around the world and not have their cruise schedule sidelined by a faulty widget.

UH-60 Black Hawk Begins Ground Tests With Far More Powerful T901 ...	A U.S. Army UH-60M Black Hawk helicopter has completed initial ground runs with two of the new T901 Improved Turbine Engines. Developed under the Improved Turbine Engine Program (ITEP), the T901 was planned to power the now-canceled Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) but will instead make its way into the UH-60 and the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter. The engine maker GE Aerospace announced today that the initial ground runs had been completed at Sikorsky’s West Palm Beach facility. Conducted ahead of test flying, the tests confirmed the basic performance of the engine’s critical systems — including fuel, electrical, hydraulic, engine and flight control systems, and engine bay flow. At the same time, aircraft and engine instrumentation provided data that will help prepare for the flight test program, which is due to start before the end of this year. The first T901-powered U.S. Army UH-60M Black Hawk during the initial ground runs with the new engines. Sikorsky The imagery of the UH-60M reveals a prominent orange-painted test boom carrying air data instrumentation jutting out from the nose. Other notable features include an orange dome on top of the main rotor boss as well as a prominent structure that covers the tail rotor hub. The exact functions of these are unclear, but they may also contain test equipment. A close-up view of the tail rotor with its unusual dome-like fairing. YouTube screencap 'The test demonstrated the T901’s start-to-fly progression, including idle and fly modes, with the rotor brake disengaged,' Sikorsky said in a statement. The initial ground runs were carried out by a combined U.S. Army and industry test team with the UH-60M operated by Army and Sikorsky pilots. We have light off!

Compared to the previous engine, the T901 offers 50 percent more power — which translates to a maximum of roughly 3,000 shaft horsepower — bringing a considerable advantage in terms of hot-and-high performance, which is otherwise a significant limiting factor for rotorcraft. The new engine is also intended to bring improved fuel efficiency. On top of this, more powerful engines should ensure that the Black Hawk and Apache can carry heavier loads over greater distances. This is a factor that would be of critical importance in a future conflict across the vast distances of the Asia-Pacific theater, in particular, where helicopters are already struggling for relevance, due to their limited endurance. Meanwhile, a simpler design and fewer parts should translate into reduced life-cycle costs. As well as traditionally manufactured components, the T901 also makes use of more exotic production techniques, including additive manufacturing and ceramic matrix composites. The first GE Aerospace T901 flight test engine accepted by the U.S. government was designated for Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) competitive prototypes. GE Aerospace Once installed in the UH-60 and AH-64, the T901 promises to provide these aircraft with increased range, longer loiter time, and reduced maintenance and sustainment costs. The Army first got its hands on the T901 in October 2023, when two flight test engines were delivered for the FARA competitive prototype effort — one of the service’s highest-profile aviation programs. Sikorsky integrated the T901 into its Raider X aircraft and conducted ground runs. However, FARA was canceled in early 2024, a decision that we discussed in detail at the time. The Raider X prototype for the FARA program. Sikorsky Another view of the Raider X. Sikorsky Photo Nevertheless, ground runs in the Raider X reduced the risk involved in Black Hawk integration and testing. In June last year, the first two T901 flight test engines for the UH-60M were handed over to Sikorsky. The first two T901-GE-900 (T901) flight test engines delivered to Sikorsky for the UH-60M Black Hawk integration. Sikorsky For both the UH-60 and AH-64, more power is fast becoming essential, with the latest versions of these helicopters operating at much greater weights than when they were first introduced, as they have increasingly added more avionics, sensors, and weapons. Speaking about the plan to put T901 engines in the AH-64 specifically, T.J. Jamison, Boeing’s business development director for the Apache and for the AH-6 Little Bird, told TWZ last November: 'The ability to bring ITEP into the Apache … sets you up for room for growth, extended range, reach, and payloads.' The ability to accommodate the new engines is something that’s ingrained in the latest V6.5 configuration of the Apache, which first flew in October of 2023 and is now coming off the production line. Although Boeing has received a developmental contract for the integration of the T901 into the Apache, the U.S. Army has decided to prioritize putting the new engine into the Black Hawk. In the meantime, Boeing is using some of its own funds to continue the design work to get the new engine into the Apache. An artist’s concept of the modernized Apache, powered by T901 engines, in an Indo-Pacific scenario. Boeing For the Apache specifically, Boeing is also working on other improvements to the propulsion system, which will complement the new engines. As you can read about here, they include the Improved Tail Rotor Blade (ITRB) and Improved Tail Rotor Drive System (ITRDS). The ITRB is primarily focused on sustainment, ensuring the tail rotor blades can be more easily repaired and maintained, including on the battlefield, while ITRDS ensures that more power and authority are delivered to the tail rotor, something that will truly come into its own once harnessed to the power of the T901. Returning to the UH-60M, the T901 is a fundamental part of the broader vision for a modernized Black Hawk fleet. Speaking about what ITEP will provide the workhorse helicopter, Hamid Salim, vice president of Army and Air Force Systems at Sikorsky, noted that the re-engined Black Hawk would be able to 'travel farther on less fuel and with more troops and cargo.' Salim also pointed specifically to the T901 enabling the UH-60M to take on new and emerging missions, 'such as deploying and managing launched effects.' A launched effect — in this case, an ALTIUS-600 — is launched from a UH-60 Black Hawk at Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona. Courtesy photo provided by Yuma Proving Ground Launched effects, previously referred to as air-launched effects (ALEs), are a category of varied uncrewed systems that you can read more about here. The new launched effects terminology reflects the fact they might be launched from land or maritime platforms, as well as crewed and uncrewed aircraft. They are a growing area of interest for the Army in particular, not only for rotary-wing platforms. As well as the new engines and launched effects, the central pillars of the modernized Black Hawk include a Modular Open Systems Approach/digital backbone, which is set to improve safety and mission readiness while reducing unscheduled maintenance. Sikorsky is also increasingly working to reduce pilot workload and increase safety by incorporating autonomous technology, meaning the future Black Hawk should be able to operate with or without any humans on board. New engine offerings could make the H-60 series and the AH-64 even more attractive to other potential customers. Both are still very much in production and the prospect of much more power in the future will only boost export prospects for what are already leaders in their respective market segments. For the U.S. Army, meanwhile, re-engining the Black Hawk and the Apache will also go some way toward ensuring these older designs can contribute, even to a limited degree, to what officials are already talking about in terms of a revolution in air assault operations — one that they expect will be heralded by the arrival of the Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) tiltrotor. An artist’s concept of the Army’s Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) tiltrotor. Bell An entirely new kind of aircraft, the Army expects FLRAA will provide it with a vastly improved set of speed, range, and survivability metrics. In the past, TWZ has questioned how the Black Hawk and the Apache might be able to better keep pace with FLRAA’s obvious difference in speed and range. While new engines won’t offer performance comparable with FLRAA, they will, at the very least, provide a significant advance over what today’s Black Hawk and Apache are capable. At the same time they will help bridge the gap to FLRAA. And even after this new aircraft enters service and fills the flightlines of Army Airfields, the UH-60 and the AH-64 are slated to continue soldiering on.

Dozens Of Israeli Patriot Missiles Sent To Ukraine	The U.S. military is providing Ukraine with around 90 interceptors for the Patriot air defense system, taking these from Israeli stocks, according to a recent report. The development, the implications of which we addressed in detail in the past, comes as Israel mulls whether to approve the transfer of significant quantities of Soviet- and Russian-made weapons to Ukraine that were seized from Hezbollah militants in recent operations. The story was broken by the U.S. news website Axios, citing three unnamed sources familiar with the matter, who said the interceptors were delivered this week. The missiles in question had previously been in storage in Israel, after the withdrawal of the Patriot system from Israel Defense Forces (IDF) service last year. Details of the story were subsequently confirmed to CNN by a U.S. defense official.

Photo by David Silverman/Getty Images David Silverman The interceptors were reportedly transported by U.S. Air Force C-17 Globemaster III aircraft, which flew between Hatzerim Air Base in southern Israel and Rzeszów in eastern Poland, which serves as a hub for moving weapons into Ukraine. Earlier today, a USAF C-17 transport flew from Ramstein Airbase in Germany to Nevatim Airbase in Israel, before flying directly to Rzeszow International Airport, the gateway for western aid headed to Ukraine. The C-17 spent roughly 3 hours on the ground in Israel.&mdash; OSINTtechnical (@osinttechnical.bsky.social) 2025-01-23T21:49:10.446Z Ukraine apparently began efforts to get the Israeli Patriot systems after the IDF announced their decommissioning, in April 2024. Kyiv’s proposal involved Israel handing the Patriots back to the United States, which would then transfer them to Ukraine. As well as the interceptors, which can immediately be used by Ukraine’s existing Patriot systems, the sources state that other components from the system, including radars, will be provided to Kyiv from Israeli stocks. These items, however, will first be refurbished in the United States. A spokesperson for the Israeli prime minister’s office confirmed that at least one Patriot system had been returned to the United States but said they didn’t know if it would ultimately be delivered to Ukraine. The IDF operated the PAC-2 GEM-T version of the Patriot, with eight batteries reportedly deployed before their withdrawal. Known by the local Hebrew name Yahalom, meaning diamond, the systems underwent some local upgrades.

Photo by JALAA MAREY/AFP via Getty Images The GEM-T designation refers to Guidance Enhanced Missile — Tactical. As we have explained in the past, the GEM subvariants are produced by upgrading older MIM-104C and D missiles to the E configuration. Converted MIM-104Ds were given additional upgrades to improve performance against tactical ballistic missiles, hence the GEM-T designation. As for the MIM-104E configuration, this features a completely new front section with upgrades that give both sub-types improved accuracy and overall performance. These interceptors feature various reliability updates, as well. While still very capable, the IDF decided to withdraw its Patriots after locally developed systems — chiefly David’s Sling, which can also defeat ballistic missiles, and the upper-tier Arrow, which specializes in ballistic missile defense — made them increasingly redundant.

Photo by GIL COHEN-MAGEN/AFP via Getty Images For Ukraine in particular, the PAC-2’s terminal-phase anti-ballistic missile capability is of particular relevance, although the system is highly versatile and able to defeat a broad spectrum of targets. Not only can the PAC-2 GEM series defeat fast-moving ballistic missiles, for example, but an improved seeker makes it better able to engage smaller targets or ones otherwise with smaller radar cross-sections. This makes it a formidable asset to deploy against fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, cruise missiles, and drones.

Ukrainian Air Force The Pentagon has provided three U.S.-made Patriot batteries to Ukraine, while Germany has donated another three batteries and six launchers, the Netherlands has donated five launchers, and Romania has donated a battery that was funded by the United States and Norway. As the video below indicates, at least some of these systems have already been lost and they remain among the most prized targets for the Russian military.

Since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Israeli government has repeatedly refused to send arms to Ukraine, while seeking to maintain relations with Moscow. In particular, Israel has been worried that direct support for Ukraine could be met by a Russian response in the form of providing Iran with more capable weapons that could in turn be used against Israel. One Ukrainian official reportedly told Axios that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu refused to take calls on the issue of Patriot transfers 'for weeks.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks during a press conference in Jerusalem. Photo by Maya Alleruzzo / POOL / AFP MAYA ALLERUZZO However, the option of returning the Patriot systems to U.S. ownership was clearly sufficient to change that policy. Final Israeli approval for the arrangement was given in late September, an Israeli official told the same publication. There’s also a precedent for this, in the transfer of artillery ammunition from Israeli stocks to Israel in 2023. In the same way, the shells were officially handed over to the United States before being transferred to Ukraine. An Israeli soldier stands guard alongside a pair of Patriot missile launchers. Photo by David Silverman/Getty Images Photo by David Silverman/Getty Images A senior Israeli official also told Axios that Russia was told in advance about the Patriot transfer, which Israel said involved 'only returning the Patriot system to the United States,' and not supplying weapons to Ukraine. It seems far-fetched to imagine that Kremlin officials didn’t understand that the air defense systems would eventually end up in Ukraine, but there was obviously little they could do. At the same time, there are signs that Israel is less concerned with maintaining its neutral stance on Russia and is instead deepening its relations with Ukraine, driven in part by Moscow’s continued support for Iran. Furthermore, with the capabilities of Iran’s proxies in the Middle East now severely diminished after Israel’s campaigns of recent months, the overall level of threat posed by Russia putting new and more advanced weapons in Iranian hands has also been reduced. Russia is also no longer a major player in Syria, after having previously furnished the Assad with a variety of weapons, including the most advanced air defenses in that country. For Ukraine, there has long been a huge demand for additional air defense systems, especially for high-end systems like the Patriot. With relentless Russian drone and missile strikes against infrastructure and cities across Ukraine, as well as the demands for aerial defense over the battlefield, the Patriot systems have been rapidly burning through their interceptors. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stands in front of a Patriot air defense system during his visit to a military training area on June 11, 2024, in Mecklenburg, Germany. Photo by Jens Büttner - Pool/Getty Images Pool Repeatedly, Ukrainian officials have made it clear that transfers of air defense equipment are among their highest priorities if the Russian invasion is to be held back. The former Patriot interceptors are a major contribution to that. Although they represent the most significant delivery of Israeli-sourced weapons from Israel to Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion, it’s far from clear whether the supply of Patriot will open the door to further transfers. In recent weeks, there has been much discussion about the possibility of Israel donating to Ukraine some of the tens of thousands of Soviet- and Russian-made weapons captured from Hezbollah in Lebanon. These weapons include man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS), Kornet anti-tank missiles, sniper rifles, and much more. Over 85,000 weapons belonging to Hezbollah were found by Israel in southern Lebanon.These weapons were intended to be deployed as part of Hezbollah’s invasion plan 'Conquer the Galilee.'Every single one of these weapons was meant to kill as many Israeli civilians as possible. pic.twitter.com/Gw6LSVtp8c&mdash; Hen Mazzig (@HenMazzig) December 29, 2024 According to a report earlier this week, Israeli and Ukrainian officials may already have met to discuss such a move. However, speculation that U.S. Air Force C-17 cargo flights between Israel and Poland were carrying ex-Hezbollah weapons may well simply have resulted from confusion around the sorties that brought Patriot interceptors. Ukrainian officials are unsurprisingly pushing for a deal that would see the captured Hezbollah arms made available for their own military. Should they be successful, it could open up one of the last major untapped resources for arms to Ukraine, something that would have huge implications for the country’s armed forces. In the meantime, the apparent arrival of Patriot interceptor missiles this week will provide Ukraine’s air defenses with a welcome boost.

F-16s Have Been Using Laser-Guided Rockets To Shoot Down Houthi D...	U.S. Air Force F-16 Vipers have been using 70mm laser-guided rockets to down Houthi drones during operations in and around the Red Sea in the past year. The service first announced it had demonstrated the ability to use Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II (APKWS II) rockets, originally developed to engage targets on the ground, as lower-cost, more numerous air-to-air weapons back in 2019, but this was just in testing. No operational capability has been disclosed, until now. A U.S. military official exclusively confirmed the use of APKWS II in the air-to-air role to TWZ. The official could not immediately confirm how many of the rockets have been used in this manner, how many Houthi drones have been shot down as a result, or the exact date of the first use of this capability in combat. The Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen began launching drone, missile, and other attacks against foreign warships and commercial vessels in and around the Red Sea, as well as targets in Israel, in October 2023. A pair of US Air Force F-16Cs on patrol somewhere in the Middle East on January 25, 2025. The jet seen at the rear is armed with a 70mm rocket pod, as well as other weapons. USAF The APWKS II air-to-air capability was first employed last year 'as one of many options for countering the Houthi UAS [uncrewed aerial systems] threat,' the official told us. 'It is a lower-cost option compared to the AIM-9X. That lower cost is one of the benefits of using it.' The unit cost of a current generation Block II subvariant of the AIM-9X Sidewinder is just under $420,000, according to Pentagon budget documents. For additional context, U.S. forces have also expended variants of the AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), the price tags of which are more than $1 million each, in the course of operations against the Houthis. At present, a single APKWS II guidance and control section costs around $15,000, with another few thousand dollars required for the warhead and motor. The only difference between APKWS IIs and standard unguided 70mm rockets is the insertion of the guidance and control section in between the warhead at the front and the motor at the rear. In this way, it has long offered a lower-cost precision-guided munition that can be created from existing components and provide a variety of different effects depending on the warhead (and fuze) used. In December 2023, the U.S. Navy said it was about to start delivering a new proximity-fuzed warhead specifically optimized for counter-drone use, though ostensibly to go with ground-based systems that use these laser-guided rockets in the surface-to-air role. The general ability of APKWS II rockets to work as surface-to-air interceptors has now been combat-proven in Ukraine. Proximity-fuzed APKWS IIs would seem equally well suited for employment in the air-to-air role. As noted, the Air Force announced in 2019 that it had conducted what it described as a proof-of-concept test of the laser-guided rockets against aerial targets, primarily as a potential lower-cost option for knocking down subsonic cruise missiles. TWZ highlighted at the time how this same capability would be similarly useful against drones. There had already been signs that the APKWS II in the air-to-air role had transitioned to an operational capability. In December, U.S. Air Forces Central (AFCENT), the top Air Force command in the Middle East, released pictures of a pair of F-16Cs refueling somewhere over the Red Sea with what appeared to be air-to-air focused loadouts. One of the jets was armed with two AIM-120s, two AIM-9Xs, and two older AIM-9Ms. The other had a pair of AIM-120s, one of each type of Sidewinder, and a seven-shot 70mm rocket pod. Both jets also carried LITENING targeting pods and High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile Targeting System (HTS) pods. The two loadouts seen on the pair of F-16s flying over the Red Sea in the pictures AFCENT released back in December. The one on the left includes a 70mm rocket pod under the right wing. USAF In an air-to-air engagement, the laser designator in the LITENING pod could be used to 'laze' or designate the target. LITENING's sensor turret can be slaved to the radar on the aircraft carrying it, or vice versa. So-called buddy lasing, where one aircraft designates the target for another, could also be useful in this case, especially given the speed differential between typical Houthi drones and F-16s. One jet could keep the target steadily lazed while the other makes its attack run. APKWS IIs are usable against drones, as well as subsonic cruise missiles, in the first place because those are relatively steady, non-reactionary, low-performance targets. The rockets are not dogfighting weapons. In the past two weeks, AFCENT has released two more sets of pictures showing F-16Cs with the same pair of weapons loadouts, as seen below. A pair of F-16s with the same two loadouts refuel somewhere in the Middle East on January 22, 2025. USAF Another pair of F-16s with the two distinct loadouts seen flying somewhere in the Middle East on January 25, 2025. USAF A similar loadout including a single seven-shot 70mm rocket pod has now also been observed on Air Force F-16Cs and Ds based in Japan, which points to this being an Air Force-wide standard option now. 2025.01.23ロケット7発#RJSM pic.twitter.com/0oy11Ch4NI&mdash; ポテッタン (@potettan620) January 23, 2025 It is not surprising that APKWS II has been used in the air-to-air role in the course of the ongoing crisis in and around the Red Sea, either. The capability is perfectly suited to the situation and, as has been noted, gives pilots a lower-cost option over existing air-to-air missiles for engaging targets like drones. The laser-guided rockets also offer valuable magazine depth, with just a single pod holding multiple engagement opportunities while taking up just one pylon. For the F-16, a seven-shot pod loaded with APKWS II rockets more than the number of air-to-air munitions the jet can carry. Separate U.S. operations in the defense of Israel last year underscored the importance of greater magazine depth in the face of mass drone and missile attacks, with jets having to land to reload while threats were still passing overhead. The crew of at least one F-15E Strike Eagle switched to guns after running out of missiles, but did not succeed in downing any targets. The recent crises across the Middle East have provided the U.S. military with a host of important lessons learned, in general. They have also highlighted concerns about weapon expenditure rates and stockpile adequacy, issues that would only be more pronounced in a high-end fight, such as one in the Pacific against China. In addition, various tiers of drones have already become a fixture on modern battlefields, as well as an increasing threat to military assets and critical infrastructure outside of traditional conflict areas, something TWZ has been calling attention to for years now. Drone technology, along with swarming capabilities, supported by advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, is only set to continue improving and proliferating, even among non-state actors like the Houthis. This, in turn, can only put additional emphasis on more economical options, like APKWS II, to help defeat large numbers of hostile uncrewed aerial systems. There is also the clear possibility for the future employment of APKWS IIs in the air-to-air role on platforms beyond the F-16, if this hasn't already happened. To date, the laser-guided rockets have been integrated onto U.S. Marine Corps AV-8B Harrier jump jets and F/A-18C/D Hornet fighters, as well as Air Force A-10 Warthog ground attack aircraft. U.S. Marine AH-1Z Viper and UH-1Y Venom, Navy MH-60R/S Seahawk, and Army AH-64 Apaches can all fire APKWS II, as well. If nothing else, APKWS II rockets are now officially a combat-proven air-to-air option for Air Force F-16s.

Denmark To Boost Greenland Military Presence Amid Trump’s Quest T...	Faced with increasing pressure from President Donald Trump to hand over the strategically important island of Greenland to the U.S., Denmark has announced plans to beef up its military presence there. Key to the $2 billion effort is the purchase of three new Arctic patrol boats, two long-range drones, and an unspecified number of new maritime patrol aircraft. These looming acquisitions are meant to replace worn-out equipment and provide additional surveillance and sensing capabilities over and around one of the world’s largest islands. The plan was announced as Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, is at the center of an increasingly strategic race to expand control and military influence across the Arctic region. The U.S., China, and Russia are all vying for the region's military, geostrategic, and economic benefits and the island is already home to one of the U.S. military’s most strategically important outposts. You can read all about this history and current status of American forces on the island, as well as its overall growing strategic significance, in our recent feature linked here. 'We are facing serious security policy challenges,' Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said in a statement on Monday which did not specifically mention Trump’s Greenland interest. 'The Danish Defense Intelligence Service assesses that the threat level in the Arctic and the North Atlantic has worsened. Therefore, we must significantly strengthen the Danish Defense presence in the regions.' New agreement strengthens the presence of the Danish Defence in the Arctic and North Atlantic region. To ensure peace and stability and strengthen defence cooperation with close Allies #StrongerTogether Denmark at NATO (@DK_NATO) January 28, 2025 This new procurement program is part of a broader security pact between Denmark, the Faroe Islands and Greenland. These governments seek to increase their ability to patrol and gain situational awareness over a 660,000-square-mile landmass with about 27,000 miles of coastline. That presence is quite limited. In addition to the ships and aircraft, Denmark has a dozen dog sled teams to monitor an area three times the size of Texas. A graphic explaining the Danish military presence in Greenland. (Danish MoD) One of the main lines of effort in the Danish plan is replacing the Royal Danish Navy’s four Thetis class patrol boats. Commissioned in 1991 and 1992, they are becoming increasingly unreliable, according to Danish officials. 'If you look at those ships, they are of course worn out,' Chief of the Navy, Rear Admiral Henrik Ryberg told the Danish DR news outlet last year. 'They are almost 40 years old. That is why I need people to start thinking about what should be next.' The Thetis class ships, he added, 'often break down and therefore cannot be operational.' The 369-foot-long vessels, which displace 3,500 tons, have a maximum speed of 20 knots when working and can operate for about 8,500 nautical miles. Designed for the harsh Arctic conditions, they feature double-skinned hulls up to 2 meters above the waterline and can sustain damage up to eight meters in length without endangering stability. The hulls have ice-breaking bows and stern lines suitable for operations in ice with only one propeller. These ships are armed with one Otobreda 76 mm Super Rapid main gun, one or two Oerlikon 20 mm guns, and depth charge dispensers. They also embark with an MH-60R Seahawk helicopter.

(Łukasz Golowanow via Wikimedia Commons) The three new Arctic ships Denmark seeks 'will be able to more effectively and flexibly solve tasks in Greenland and carry capabilities such as helicopters and drones,' Poulsen stated. He did not provide details about what specifications he seeks or the timeline for delivery. We reached out to the Danish Defense Ministry for additional details and will update this story with any pertinent details. For maritime patrol, inspection and transport, Denmark relies on four Canadair CL-604 Challenger bizjet aircraft. The CL-604s are militarized variants of the Bombardier Challenger 604 with saddle tanks to enhanced fuel capacity, a new undercarriage to support higher takeoff and landing weights, structural improvements to the wings and tail, as well as a modern Rockwell Collins Pro Line 4 avionics system. A decade ago, Denmark embarked on a midlife upgrade program that included a new downlink and a multirole radar capable of carrying out surface surveillance, weather monitoring and oil slick detection. 'The Challenger aircraft are near the end of their operational lifespan and need to be replaced,' the Danish Defense Ministry stated. 'The opening of new airports across Greenland means new opportunities for establishing partnerships with airlines regarding inspection, surveillance, and transportation.' The details of the funding and procurement schedule for the replacement aircraft are being worked out with officials from the Faroe Islands and Greenland as part of a broader security agreement, the Danish MoD explained. Royal Danish Air Force Chellenger 604. (NATO Facebook page) Denmark also wants two new 'long-range drones with advanced image acquisition capacity that can monitor large areas over long distances and obtain detailed images,' Poulsen explained. He did not say what kinds of drones, what kind of sensors or when they would be procured or fielded. While Denmark has been seeking a lot of these capabilities for several years, the plan unveiled Monday comes in the wake of increasingly contentious relations between Trump and the Danish government over the future of Greenland. Even before he was inaugurated, Trump reportedly berated Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, with the former insisting 'he wanted the United States to take over Greenland,' The New York Times reported. That was after he refused to rule out military or economic coercion to bring Greenland and the Panama Canal under U.S. control during a press conference on Jan. 8. 'I can’t assure you on either of those two,' Trump told reporters. 'But I can say this, we need them for economic security.' Question on Greenland and Panama Canal: 'Can you assure the world that as you try to get control of these areas you are not going to use military or economic coercion?President-Elect Trump: 'No&#8230;I can't assure you on either of those two. We need them for economic security&#8230;' pic.twitter.com/zJ8Fb67ZrX&mdash; CSPAN (@cspan) January 7, 2025 The same day, Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., touched down in Greenland for what was described as a tourist visit, during which he reportedly handed out hats bearing the slogan ‘Make Greenland Great Again.’ Meanwhile, Trump’s National Security Adviser Mike Waltz said the strategy is bigger than Greenland itself. 'This is about the Arctic,' he said. 'You have Russia that is trying to become king.' Frederiksen earlier this month ruled out the possibility of coming to a deal with the United States that would see Greenland handed over. Instead, the future of the territory would be decided by its people. 'Greenland is not for sale,' Frederiksen said. The U.S., as we have previously reported, already has a significant military presence in Greenland. That includes the former Thule Air Base, which was turned over to the U.S. Space Force in 2020 and renamed Pituffik Space Base in 2023. Overseen by the Space Force’s 821st Space Base Group, its mission is 'to enable force projection, space superiority, and scientific research in the Arctic region for our nation and allies through integrated base support and defense operations,' according to the Space Force. With Pituffik Space Base, the 821st Space Base Group is responsible for the U.S. military’s northernmost installation. Beyond the airfield, the massive radar system used for early warning and tracking of ballistic missiles is of extreme strategic importance to the United States. A satellite view of Pituffik Space Force Base in Greenland. (Google Earth) Meanwhile, Russia has placed a huge strategic importance on the Arctic, with many investments in the region. In recent years, Moscow has been heavily committed to increasing its air and naval power in the Arctic Circle and has been establishing new bases in the region, as well as reactivating ones that fell into disuse after the Cold War. China has also been expanding its presence in the Arctic. These two nations have also been stepping up their joint military operations in the Arctic region. Last July, two Chinese H-6 bombers and a pair of Russian Tu-95 Bear bombers flew through a portion of the Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) around Alaska. It marked the first time China’s H-6s operated in that part of the world. Beyond the military implications of this region are potential new shipping routes and mineral resources that will become available as the ice continues to melt. These factors are largely perpetuating the looming struggle for control over wide swathes of the Arctic region. Amid all this, Denmark is seeking European help in opposing Trump’s Greenland quest. 'Frederiksen dashed between Berlin, Brussels and Paris on Tuesday to shore up support in the face of Trump’s increasingly aggressive overtures toward the territory,' Politico noted on Tuesday. Trump’s interest in Greenland will likely be a big part of an informal meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on Feb. 3, Politico reported, citing several people familiar with the plans. Denmark's PM seeks support on trip to Berlin and other EU capitals as fears grow over Trump's threats against Greenland pic.twitter.com/nq9Gkubc49&mdash; DW Politics (@dw_politics) January 28, 2025 Buying a few new ships, aircraft and drones is clearly no game-changer in Denmark’s efforts to maintain control over Greenland. The announcement of the plan, however, seems to be another indication that it has no intention of giving up the island.

Spain Now Wants To Convert Its Aircraft Carrier For Drone Operati...	Spain is the latest nation to look at introducing carrier-based drones, which it plans to integrate on its sole aircraft carrier, the Spanish Navy flagship Juan Carlos I. While it’s unclear what kind of launch and recovery system will be added to the warship, should the studies prove successful, introducing carrier-based drones could help ensure the longer-term relevance of the vessel once its venerable EAV-8B+ Matador II attack jets head for retirement. Airbus and the Spanish shipbuilder Navantia today announced the signature of an agreement to explore the integration of the SIRTAP drone on the Juan Carlos I. A mockup of the SIRTAP drone on the Juan Carlos I. Airbus 'This joint effort seeks to achieve a fully integrated system, ensuring complete compatibility between SIRTAP and the Juan Carlos I carrier, increasing its mission capabilities, operational flexibility, and the overall effectiveness of both platforms in diverse operational scenarios,' Airbus said in a statement. The current agreement seeks to ensure that the SIRTAP is fully interoperable with the Spanish flattop, not only in terms of flying to and from its flight deck but also being integrated into the carrier’s SCOMBA combat management system. Airbus According to Airbus, the integration of the drone on the carrier will focus on separate areas of study, namely command and control (C2), combat system integration, and navigation support (including takeoff and landing operations). The Juan Carlos I is generally described as a landing helicopter dock (LHD), a type of amphibious assault ship. However, it also has a fixed-wing combat aircraft capability, with a ‘ski jump’ takeoff ramp on the bow for short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) operations. For this, it’s equipped with the EAV-8B+ Matador II — equivalent to the U.S. Marine Corps AV-8B+ Harrier II — making it Spain’s sole aircraft carrier. A U.S. Navy MH-60S and two Spanish Navy SH-60B helicopters fly near the Spanish amphibious assault ship Juan Carlos I during interoperability training in the Adriatic Sea, in February 2023. U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Samuel Wagner Petty Officer 3rd Class Samuel Wagner As for the SIRTAP, this was developed by Airbus as 'a high-end tactical unmanned aircraft system.' Spain became the launch customer for the drone in late 2023 and is currently due to receive nine systems — each comprising one ground control station and three aircraft. Providing that integration of the SIRTAP on the Juan Carlos I is successful, orders could well increase. The SIRTAP is primarily a surveillance platform, specifically designed to accommodate two payloads simultaneously: typically, an electro-optical turret and a multi-mission radar, as part of a 400-pound mission payload. The drone has an endurance of more than 20 hours. Even before today’s announcement, Airbus was touting the overwater capabilities of the drone, highlighting missions including day/night and maritime intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). Airbus While Airbus and Navantia haven’t so far presented a timeline for the integration work, Airbus has released photos showing a SIRTAP mockup on the deck of the carrier, while it was in port. In the past, it’s been reported that the first SIRTAP prototype — which is being built at the Airbus facility in Getafe, Spain — should take to the air before the end of this year. We also don’t yet know how the companies envision carrier operations involving the SIRTAP. While the Juan Carlos I has a takeoff ramp, it doesn’t have a catapult launch system or arrester cables. Most likely, the approach will parallel that being explored by Turkey. Parallels are especially likely since the Turkish Navy’s ‘drone carrier’ Anadolu uses a design based on that of the Juan Carlos I. It also features a large open flight deck with a ramp at the bow. So far, the Bayraktar TB3 has successfully landed on and taken off from the Anadolu and there are plans for more capable drones to be embarked in the future. The Turkish Navy flagship, Anadolu, is planned to be used as a carrier for different tiers of armed drones. Photo by Serhat Cagdas/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images Turkey first announced plans to convert the Anadolu as a ‘drone carrier’ in 2023. Modifications to be carried out on the Turkish vessel included the addition of dedicated control stations, beyond-line-of-sight satellite communications terminals, a ‘roller system’ on the flight deck toward the bow to help launch uncrewed aircraft, an arresting gear system, and safety nets. In the initial videos showing the TB3 being tested aboard the Anadolu, two of which are embedded below, no launch or recovery systems were yet visible. It’s also possible that Spain might opt for different solutions to make its carrier drone-compatible. Sevda kuşun kanadında.. TCG-ANADOLU’ya ilk iniş-kalkış..#BayraktarTB3 pic.twitter.com/sfBMQDIyE0&mdash; Selçuk Bayraktar (@Selcuk) November 19, 2024 Regardless, having drones operate from the deck of the Juan Carlos I would be a big deal for the Spanish Navy. Unlike the Turkish TB3, which can carry small precision-guided missiles and bombs, as well as rockets and other munitions, the SIRTAP isn’t currently planned to carry armament. Currently, Spain is likely to retire its EAV-8B jets from around 2030 to 2034. The only like-for-like replacement is the F-35B, but for a force of only 13 Matador IIs, this would likely be cost-prohibitive. Fielding an armed naval drone would be one option for the Spanish Navy to preserve its carrier-based fixed-wing strike capabilities. While the SIRTAP won’t meet those requirements, it will at least provide very valuable experience in operating drones from a carrier. In this way, it could pave the way for Spain to acquire more advanced armed drones that could help replace the capabilities that are otherwise set to be lost when the EAV-8B is retired. A Spanish Navy EAV-8B+ Matador II. Contando Estrelas/Wikimedia Commons Ultimately, other types of drones flying from the Juan Carlos I could attack certain targets on land and at sea, as well as conduct surveillance and reconnaissance missions. Even if an unarmed navalized drone, like the SIRTAP, could provide very welcome surveillance capabilities, helping build a recognized maritime picture that can be shared with other Spanish Navy and allied assets. As well as improving maritime situational awareness, the drone could also use its sensors for targeting. Potentially, the SIRTAP drones could also act as aerial network relay nodes and, depending on the type of radar fitted, possibly even serve as airborne early warning platforms. Previously, the Spanish Navy operated SH-3 Sea King helicopters adapted for airborne early warning, but these have long since been retired, with this capability being lost in the process. At this point, we still don’t know for sure if Spain will adopt the SIRTAP for carrier operations, or even if it might end up selecting another drone for this emerging requirement. In the meantime, Spain joins a growing number of nations that are looking to add fixed-wing drones to their aviation-capable warships, with big-deck amphibious warfare ships being especially well suited to this. China is currently very much at the forefront of these endeavors, including developing advanced flying-wing UCAVs that can operate from carriers and other big-deck ships. The same country is also developing an entirely new class of super-sized amphibious assault ships that are very likely optimized for drone operations. In the United Kingdom, the Royal Navy has begun demonstrating its ability to launch and recover drones from flattops, including the General Dynamics Mojave, which head operated from the aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales. This is part of a wider effort to expand the Royal Navy’s uncrewed naval aviation capabilities. A Mojave drone during trials from the deck of HMS Prince of Wales. GA-ASI Late last year, a Gray Eagle STOL drone was successfully launched from South Korea’s Dokdo amphibious assault ship as part of another demonstration but recovered at a base on land. You can read more about those trials here. The Gray Eagle STOL drone undertakes its first experimental operations from a warship, taking off from the deck of the South Korean amphibious assault ship Dokdo last November. ROKN Meanwhile, as well as the Mojave and Gray Eagle, General Atomics is also offering a derivative of its MQ-9 Reaper that can operate from big-deck ships, as well as a carrier-capable member of its highly modular Gambit family of uncrewed aircraft. Recently, General Atomics also pitched a version of its Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) for installation on a variety of naval vessels, allowing them to launch drones. These included the U.K. Royal Navy’s Type 45 destroyer and the U.S. Navy’s Expeditionary Sea Base. Previously, General Atomics had also offered similar EMALS solutions to launch drones from the U.K. Royal Navy’s Queen Elizabeth class and the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force’s Izumo class carriers. Among the other countries now exploring fixed-wing naval drone capabilities is Japan, while Spain’s neighbor, Portugal, has also ordered a new 'multi-purpose vessel' that will be able to operate drones. These will help it fulfill a range of missions, including oceanic research, search and rescue, emergency relief, and naval support operations. Concept artwork showing the carrier-capable Gambit 5 drone operating from the Japanese amphibious assault ship Izumo. GA-ASI As TWZ has noted before, the U.S. Navy has been somewhat slow on the uptake, although the MQ-25 Stingray tanker drone is set to become its first operational advanced uncrewed carrier-based aircraft. The MQ-25 will have a secondary surveillance and reconnaissance capability, and there remains a possibility that it will eventually add new roles, including stand-off strike, in the future. At the same time, the U.S. Navy is now working to install new dedicated drone control centers on its carriers, as part of a broader effort to help it realize its own larger uncrewed naval aviation plans. The U.S. Navy service has said that it plans for its carrier air wings to eventually become at least 60 percent pilotless. Now, there is something of a race on, to see which navy fields the first operational ‘drone carrier.’ While it won’t be the first to achieve this, it’s notable that Spain is now looking to field these kinds of capabilities on the Juan Carlos I. Integrating drones, especially more advanced ones, could potentially provide the flagship with a vital new mission, and a rejuvenated air wing, especially once the EAV-8B Matador II is retired.

Weaponizing Space Key To Trump’s Iron Dome Missile Defense Shield...	President Donald Trump has laid out a vision for a new Iron Dome air and missile defense system to shield the U.S. homeland, which directly hearkens back to the Reagan-era Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). A renewed call to deploy space-based anti-missile interceptors is a central aspect of the plan as it has been presented now, which focuses primarily on defending against ballistic and other higher-end missile threats. In addition, any explicit mention of the ever-growing danger posed by drones is conspicuously absent. Trump had talked about the Iron Dome plan, which is also part of the current official Republican Party platform, on the campaign trail, and TWZ explored what was known about it in detail last year. The President has now provided new, more specific information in an Executive Order, a copy of which was posted online late last night. Trump says he's signing an executive order to have the Defense Department start constructing an Iron Dome defense system for the US pic.twitter.com/vsJSvDXFDF&mdash; Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) January 27, 2025 It is important to note up front that the Executive Order confirms that the new U.S. Iron Dome system is unrelated to the Israeli Iron Dome system, despite the shared name and Trump's off-handed references to the latter when talking about the former. The Iron Dome system from Israel's Rafael, as seen in the video below, is designed primarily to defend against lower-end and localized threats like artillery rockets and mortar shells. It does now also have some capability against drones and cruise missiles. 'The threat of attack by ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles, and other advanced aerial attacks, remains the most catastrophic threat facing the United States,' the Executive Order declares. 'Over the past 40 years, rather than lessening, the threat from next-generation strategic weapons has become more intense and complex with the development by peer and near-peer adversaries of next-generation delivery systems and their own homeland integrated air and missile defense capabilities.' 'He's what we need, to immediately begin the construction of a state-of-the-art Iron Dome missile defense shield, which will be able to protect Americans,' Trump also said at an event yesterday. The meat of the Executive Order is a call for a 'next-generation missile defense shield' that 'shall include, at a minimum, plans for' the following eight components: Defense of the United States against ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks from peer, near-peer, and rogue adversaries Acceleration of the deployment of the Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor layer Development and deployment of proliferated space-based interceptors capable of boost-phase intercept Deployment of underlayer and terminal-phase intercept capabilities postured to defeat a countervalue attack Development and deployment of a custody layer of the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture Development and deployment of capabilities to defeat missile attacks prior to launch and in the boost phase Development and deployment of a secure supply chain for all components with next-generation security and resilience features Development and deployment of non-kinetic capabilities to augment the kinetic defeat of ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks The Executive Order gives Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth just 60 days to present a path forward to implementing all of this and potentially more. The Office of Management and Budget is also tasked with formulating a cost estimate that will inform the upcoming proposed defense budget for the 2026 Fiscal Year. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth walks with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Air Force Gen. CQ Brown, Jr. after arriving at the Pentagon on January 27, 2025. DOD Petty Officer 1st Class Alexander Kubitza Addition provisions in the order require U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM) and U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) to jointly produce 'an updated assessment of the strategic missile threat to the Homeland' and 'a prioritized set of locations to progressively defend against a countervalue attack by nuclear adversaries.' Calls for bolstering regional air and missile defense capabilities, and to work with allies and partners to that end, are also included. The term countervalue is typically used in the context of planning for the employment of nuclear weapons, or responses to their use. It refers to the targeting of key military and other assets critical to a country's ability to wage war. It is also worth pointing out here that larger ballistic missiles and their payloads, in general, typically reach hypersonic speeds in the latter stages of their flight. The hypersonic threats mentioned here refer to advanced designs with added emphasis on very high maneuverability and largely flat atmospheric trajectories that make them especially hard to track and defend against. A graphic showing, in a very rudimentary way, the difference in trajectories between a traditional ballistic missile and an unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicle, a type of highly maneuverable hypersonic weapon. Pseudo or aeroballistic missiles and air-breathing hypersonic cruise missiles are also depicted. GAO The U.S. military's current dedicated homeland missile defense posture is focused primarily on shielding against limited strikes involving higher-end ballistic threats, and now increasingly novel hypersonic ones, primarily through a relatively small number of land-based interceptors tied to larger sensor and communications networks. Outside of the National Capital Region (NCR) around Washington, D.C., more general air defense duties, including protecting against incoming cruise missiles, falls almost exclusively to the U.S. Air Force (including the Air National Guard). Ground-based surface-to-air missiles (SAM) are deployed within the NCR, but the United States has not had a nation-wide SAM network since the 1970s. A graphic offering a very general look at the fields of coverage offered by the current elements of the US military’s missile defense architecture inside the United States and forward-deployed elsewhere around the world. US Army Some of what the Iron Dome Executive Order lays now out, including the named Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor (HBTSS) and Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA), is already in the works. HBTSS' central goal is the deployment of a new satellite constellation capable of not just providing improved early warning and situation awareness, but also fire control-quality tracks, including against highly maneuverable hypersonic threats. Two demonstrator HBTSS satellites are already in orbit. PWSA is working toward a multi-layered, distributed space-based networking backbone to support air and missile defense and other missions. The U.S. military has also been working on new 'underlayer and terminal-phase intercept capabilities,' including the Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI) for use against maneuvering hypersonic weapons. Efforts to develop options to neutralize ballistic and other missile threats at the point of launch, or even before they are launched (sometimes referred to as 'left of launch'), from any domain, are not new, either. The video below depicts a notional intercept involving various current and future missile defense capabilities, including GPI and HBTSS. The new call for space-based interceptors is notable, especially amid concerns about the broader weaponization of space already. At the same time, orbital missile defense capabilities, including physical interceptors and directed energy weapons, were areas of particularly active interest in President Trump's first term. There were also calls to field new and improved counter-space capabilities, including space-based kinetic weapons, under President Joe Biden. One of former Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall's last acts was to publish a report outlining a vision for future U.S. air and space capabilities by 2050 that explicitly mentions 'counterspace systems [that] will include a cost-effective mix of weapons, both terrestrial and on orbit.' As already noted, the Iron Dome Executive Order draws a direct comparison to Ronald Reagan's SDI, which was also envisioned as an array of ground and space-based anti-missile capabilities paired with new sensors and communications networks. 'President Ronald Reagan endeavored to build an effective defense against nuclear attacks, and while this program resulted in many technological advances, it was canceled before its goal could be realized,' the new order says. However, highlighting SDI also raises immediate questions about the viability of the new Iron Dome plan. SDI was infamously nicknamed 'Star Wars' by its critics and never came close to meeting its ambitious goals. President Bill Clinton finally brought it to a close for good in 1993 after some $30 billion – close to $56.1 billion in today's dollars – had been spent. U.S. missile defense efforts subsequently coalesced around more limited objectives, which ultimately led to the creation of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA). An artist’s conception of a space-based particle beam missile defense system from the Star Wars era. Los Alamos National Laboratory via Aerospace Projects Review The same kinds of criticisms leveled against SDI, including fears of prompting new arms races, especially in space, and the significant technical and other challenges in implementing the desired capabilities, are likely to come up again with Trump's Iron Dome plan. There will also be new cost concerns given that U.S. defense budgets are already facing increasing difficulties balancing competing priorities, especially around expensive nuclear modernization efforts. In addition, since the U.S. government withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002, something the new Executive Order also explicitly mentions, Russia and China, especially, have already been investing in new capabilities specifically designed to defeat or at least challenge American missile defense capabilities. China is also significantly expanding its nuclear stockpile, a trend that could continue there and emerge elsewhere, in response to the Iron Dome plan. Missile defense advocates have argued, in turn, that these realities put the United States at a dangerous disadvantage that requires additional protective measures. There is also a question of prioritization, which brings us to the matter of uncrewed aerial threats. At best, the Iron Dome plan lumps drones into the category of threats capable of executing 'other next-generation aerial attacks,' but that would de-emphasize the serious dangers posed now by even lower-end weaponized commercial designs. Alarms bells about the adequacy of domestic U.S. air defense capabilities, or the lack thereof, against less advanced threats like drones and cruise missiles have increasingly ringing in recent years. The line between drones, especially longer-range kamikaze types, and traditional cruise missiles is becoming increasingly blurry, too. Elements of a US Army Patriot surface-to-air missile battery deployed at Easterwood Airport in College Station, Texas during an exercise in 2020. Reader Submission TWZ has for years now been highlighting drone threats, which are already on the cusp of becoming newly significant thanks to artificial intelligence and machine learning-driven technological developments that are also increasingly proliferating. As we wrote when talking about Trump's Iron Dome ambitions as they were known last summer: 'Drones, even lower-end weaponized commercial types, present an ever-growing threat in their own right, something that the war in Ukraine has helped finally push into the mainstream consciousness. The barrier to entry in this domain is extremely low, with terrorists, criminal groups, and other non-state actors – like the [Iranian-backed] Houthis [in Yemen] – increasingly using uncrewed aerial systems to launch attacks, as well as to conduct surveillance. Even relatively cheap examples of these systems can fly over extreme distances and strike with pinpoint accuracy. Their low and slow characteristics, and the fact that launch points can come from so far away, make them very hard to defend against. This poses a whole new threat dimension to the U.S., one in which the homeland is clearly vulnerable.' 'Looking outward for drone threats from America’s borders only factors in one facet of the issue. Attacks present the additional danger of being something that small groups or even individuals within the United States, can readily mount. The complexity of these potential attacks will only increase as the hardware and software to execute them proliferates even in the commercial space.' 'Reports of concerning drone activity over military bases and training ranges, as well as other sensitive sites, inside the United States, are only becoming more commonplace. U.S. authorities have said that many sightings of what are now commonly called unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), previously referred to as unidentified flying objects (UFO), have been assessed to have been uncrewed aircraft, as well as balloons, on closer examination, as well. It’s worth noting here that the U.S. military and other armed forces around the world, especially China, have been actively working to develop and field high-altitude balloons as penetrating launch platforms for drones and munitions, among other missions.' Still-unexplained drone incursions over Langley Air Force base in Virginia in December 2023, which TWZ was first to report, helped turn the issue into a national cause celebre last year. A flurry of reported drone sightings in the skies over New Jersey late last year, which we were also first to report on and evolved into something of a nationwide hysteria, both underscored and obscured the very real national security concerns at play. Drone incursions around bases hosting U.S. forces in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe have made clear this is a global issue. Jacek Boczarski/Anadolu via Getty Images The Pentagon did notably roll out a new counter-drone strategy in 2024. At the same time, U.S. military officials highlighted significant policy and other challenges still limiting their ability to respond to uncrewed aerial threats domestically last year. It is possible that the new Trump administration may seek to address the drone threat through other actions. Trump has already pushed for officials to loosen restrictions on using force against uncrewed aerial systems along the southern border through a separate Executive Order. Though we now have more specific details, there is much still to learn about Trump's new Iron Dome plan, and how and when it might implemented, in general.

What Red Sea Battles Have Taught The Navy About A Future China Fi...	The Navy’s surface fleet has spent the past 15 months taking down hundreds of missiles and drones fired by Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels at U.S. and allied Navies’ ships, as well as commercial vessels in and around the Red Sea. While it has become the most intense sustained combat the sea service’s warships have seen since World War II, the Navy continues to prioritize preparing for a conflict in the Pacific. This begs the question: What lessons does the Red Sea fight offer the Navy when it comes to preparing for conflict with its top pacing threat, China? TWZ reached out to a range active-duty and retired military officers to answer this question. They said the Red Sea was a prime stress test for a fleet preparing for war with China, even as it drained finite munitions and further exposed shortfalls in the defense industrial base. 'A lot of these lessons and everything that we are taking from the Red Sea are an incredibly valuable warm-up for us in the high-end fight,' an active-duty surface warfare officer (SWO) who spoke with TWZ on the condition of anonymity said. The Navy destroyer USS Donald Cook (DDG-75) launches a SM-2 missile during an exercise in 2020. (U.S. Navy) Analysts acknowledged the obvious — that China would be an entirely different adversary to take on compared to the Houthis, and that war with Beijing would be far more fearsome and intense than the Houthi campaign. But while the theater, geography and capability of the adversary would differ, the Red Sea has nonetheless been a major experience generator and proving ground on several fronts. Even without the China preparation angle, the Navy has earned some undeniable wins in the Red Sea. No American warships have been hit, and crews have countered Houthi attacks that have, at times, come dangerously close to putting a hole in a gray hull. Navy brass say they are now able to tune ship radars, provide feedback and update tactics far more rapidly now than when the hostilities started. Just analyzing engagement data has gone from 40 days or more to just a day or two, a massive gain that could prove critical in a Pacific fight. A year ago, TWZ detailed how the potential implications of this unprecedented amount of real-world experience and its resulting data flowing out of so many engagements, and how lessons learned from it could be used to the advantage of not only the U.S. Navy, but China as well. The destroyer USS Gravely (DDG-107) launches Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAM) in the Red Sea in January 2024. (U.S. Navy) Despite the Red Sea success so far, the surface fleet must remain humble, according to a retired warship captain who spoke to TWZ on condition of anonymity to share his thoughts. 'I think it is important that we not be lulled into a sense of complacency by our own success,' he said. 'We are fighting a high-end fight against a low-end adversary. The weapons, tactics, and strategic implications of a Pacific war could be quite different and more challenging.' The lessons the Navy has learned for fighting in a littoral environment like the Red Sea would be applicable to potential littoral conflict in the South China Sea or Luzon Strait, weapons engagement zones that would be far more saturated than an open ocean war. But even within a blue water fight over the expanses of the Pacific, key lessons apply, the active-duty SWO said. 'When you are in the littorals, your timelines are shorter' for tracking and intercepting incoming fire, he said. 'If you can execute on a littoral timeline, then you can execute on a blue water timeline.' Working through environmental frictions and the fog of war in the Red Sea is also a good dry run ahead of conflict with China, he said. 'The geography, the way the Houthis have evolved, is giving us some great insight, and it directly translates into us getting ready for that high-end fight against China,' the active-duty SWO said. And while Beijing may employ more advanced drones, anti-ship missiles and other ordnance, and in different ways, the Red Sea experience in taking out those threats still carries over, the active-duty SWO said. 'A missile, no matter what the origin is, is still going to be targeted,' he said. 'It’s still going to be targeting you, and a lot of those kinetic aspects still transfer over to even a higher-end type of missile.' While the Red Sea has been a closed-in, littoral fight, drones would still be seen in a blue-water war with China, the active-duty SWO said, noting Chinese amphibious ships that are being built to carry and launch advanced unmanned systems. TWZ reported last fall on China’s Type 076 amphib and its electromagnetic catapult for launching drones. Smaller drones don’t even need this infrastructure and can be launched in large numbers from nearly any vessel. China's Type 076 amphibious assault ship. (Chinese Internet capture via X) The math of wartime missile expenditure is another prime Red Sea takeaway that is applicable to a China war, according to Jan van Tol, a retired forward-deployed warship captain and current senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments think tank. Expensive surface-to-air (SAM) missiles that take a long time to procure and build have regularly been used to shoot down relatively cheap Houthi aerial attack drones, he said. Go here to read TWZ’s reporting about precisely which Navy munitions have been fired in the Red Sea, and how many times. But expenditure rates of guided munitions will be 'far worse in a China fight,' van Tol said. Exacerbating that reality is the fact that the PLA’s weapons are more sophisticated than the Iranian-derived munitions on which the Houthis rely, which will likely increase the number of American SAMs expended per engagement with the Chinese. China has far more anti-ship missiles than the Houthis, in a variety of iterations. It has developed short, medium, and intermediate-range anti-ship ballistic missiles to help exert authority over its broad territorial claims and deny opponents access to vast areas during conflicts. If Beijing attempts to invade Taiwan, it will rely on a variety of munitions to keep U.S. surface combatants and aircraft carriers far from the East China Sea and South China Sea. This is all part of the PLA’s overreaching anti-access/area-denial strategy that is currently heavily dictating what a war would look like in the Pacific. A very general look at some of the breadth of conventionally-armed long-range missile options China has, and the ranges they can reach. (DOD) 'PLA raid density will be far higher than the relative dribbles of Houthi attacks, so Navy ships will quickly run out of SAMs,' van Told said, adding that some U.S. Vertical Launching System (VLS) missile cells are loaded with non-SAM weapons, and that U.S. warships will have to retire to rearming locations far from the fight. The Navy is trying to mitigate having ships leave the battle for days or even weeks at a time for reloading via an at-sea VLS reloading capability known as the Transferrable Reloading At-sea Method (TRAM) that was demonstrated for the first time last fall. Go here to read TWZ coverage of that effort. Sailors aboard the Navy cruiser USS Chosin (CG-65) use the Transferrable Reload At-sea Method (TRAM) to grasp a missile canister over the ship's MK 41 Vertical Launching System (VLS) in October. (U.S. Navy) In a high-intensity war with China, SAMs and other weapons would be exhausted quickly, and the American defense industrial base 'has relatively little surge production capacity relative to need,' van Tol said. The Red Sea has hammered home the need to increase production of Navy munitions, van Tol said. A peacetime effort to increase precision-guided munition production of all kinds would help to identify component subcontractor chokepoints and other hiccups that would metastasize into a major problem when a surge in demand happens during a war with China. Military leaders have warned of how missiles fired in the Red Sea and elsewhere are eating into stocks that could be used for a war with China too. 'It would be important to identify those and make [defense industrial base] investments to ease those chokepoints,' he said. 'This was analogous to the difficult production problems the U.S. initially faced in 1939-1941 during the pre-Pearl Harbor industrial mobilization, which really was spurred by huge French and British demands for arms starting in the late 1930s … If it wasn’t for the ‘head start’ working out the problems while supplying those allies, the vast production of 1943-1944 would have never been possible.' While concerns about supply remain, the Red Sea is offering invaluable, real-world proof that a Navy warships’ air defense weapons actually work in combat, according to the active-duty SWO. 'We’re going to be facing an even higher-end fight against China,' he said. 'Confidence in the system is extremely important for us, for those sailors and operators and Marines and others that are going to be pushing out forward for that fight … whether it is a five-inch round, or whatever ordnance, a missile coming off a rail from an aircraft.' Military history is full of examples of weapon systems that appeared to be good to go, only to fail in the heat of battle, Mark Cancian, a retired Marine Corps colonel and senior advisor with the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, told TWZ. He pointed to the Navy’s defective Mk 14 torpedoes during World War II as a prime example. A Mk 14 torpedo is balanced during World War II. (U.S. Navy) 'Real world operations always enhance warfighting readiness because nothing is simulated,' he noted. 'Everything must be done, and there is a concrete result in the end. Even the best training doesn’t replicate these conditions.' The Navy would also face a multi-domain attack from China. Unlike the Houthis, who have largely launched airborne weapons and sometimes surface drones at warships, the PLA would come at the service in the undersea, space and cyber domains as well, van Tol said. 'Ships will not have the ‘luxury’ of concentrating on only one domain,' he said. While short on specifics, the active-duty SWO noted that the Navy’s electronic warfare (EW) capabilities have also benefited from real-world experience in the Red Sea. 'The exploitation of the RF spectrum to try and stay to the left of kinetic engagements is always something that we would like to take advantage of,' he said. 'Electrons are free, and I can read and I can produce those as long as I’m making electricity … there’s a lot of lessons learned on that aspect that we were able to put forth, from a detection to an engagement, in that whole kill chain aspect.' While the Red Sea campaign doesn’t come close to matching the intensity of operations should a war with China break out, it nonetheless provides the Navy with invaluable real-world insight into how systems work and what planning, training and procedures need to be tightened up, according to Bradley Martin, a retired surface warfare officer (SWO) who spent two-thirds of his 30-year Navy career at sea. Among the lessons the Navy can take out of the Red Sea are the stark realities of cyclic carrier air wing operations near an enemy’s weapons engagement zone, said Martin, now a senior policy analyst with the RAND think tank. The perils of such operations came into focus last month, when the cruiser USS Gettysburg (CG-64) accidentally shot down a F/A-18 Super Hornet during a sustained Houthi attack on the USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75). The Navy has released few details on the encounter, but at least three investigations are underway to determine what transpired. Flight operations aboard the USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75) in December. (U.S. Navy) 'Dealing with attacks from an enemy with a substantial shore-based arsenal is an important experience' as well, Martin added. The Houthi arsenal is provided via Iran, and past TWZ reporting revealed that the Navy has taken out more than 400 of the group’s anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCM), anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBM) and aerial attack drones since October 2023. Some of the arsenal fielded by the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. (IISS) ©2023, The International Institute for Strategic Studies, originally published on (reproduced with permission) But while the Red Sea is providing the Navy with valuable lessons, 'readiness is without question being drained,' Martin said. The U.S. Navy’s part in defending Israel from Iranian and Houthi ballistic missile attacks, and the tying in with Israeli defense infrastructure to accomplish that, has direct relevance to Taiwan’s defense in a future fight as well, the active-duty SWO said. Culturally, the Red Sea fight is nudging the surface fleet out of its 'peacetime' footing and giving it a taste of what war with China would entail, van Tol said. With the exception of Navy SEALs and some aviators, the fleet has not faced a serious threat of being attacked for decades, which has inhibited 'tough, realistic training.' A 'safety first' culture is fine and necessary for a peacetime Navy, but it is not helpful for preparing in earnest for a real conflict, he said. 'This has now seemingly changed to some extent … when ships deploy to the Red Sea, the crews know that they may come under attack,' van Tol said. 'The real chance of having to no-kidding defend the ship helps concentrate the mind wonderfully. This change in mindset and mentality is really important and seems to be happening.' Sailors stand watch in the combat information center of the Navy destroyer USS Carney (DDG-64) in October 2023. (U.S. Navy) The Red Sea has further reinforced the importance of maintaining a high level of tactical training and proficiency among a ship’s watch teams during war, he added. Such training can’t be limited to pre-deployment work-ups, because a war with China will come with relatively little notice. 'Ditto with regard to damage control training and material readiness,' van Tol said. 'The ships that have operated in the Red Sea to date have done a great job defensively so far, no hits. But even the Houthis may get lucky on an attack. Against the PLA’s much more potent threats, the odds of ships being hit would be far higher.' The current conflict is teaching the surface fleet vital lessons for the next war when it comes to crew stress under the threat of constant engagement, while instilling in sailors that all the training that they do really matters in the real world, according to the active-duty SWO. The surface fleet has increased how it monitors sailor wellbeing and ensures that those who need help get it as soon as possible as a result, he said. 'That’s an important aspect that we can’t just gloss over,' he said. 'That is the sailor's investment in the combat situation. We’ve seen a lot of initiatives pay off, and we’re getting better data on that.' The Red Sea has also helped to demystify certain munitions fired by the Houthis – variants of which China would use in a future fight – and proved that a U.S. warship can defeat them, according to James Holmes, a maritime strategy professor at the Naval War College. The Houthis are the first entity to ever fire an anti-ship ballistic missile in anger, and the Navy has now shown that such weapons can be taken out. 'The same goes for ‘kamikaze drones,’ which essentially serve the same purpose, as ship killers,' Holmes told TWZ in an email. 'Demystifying the next big and bad thing is a major contribution. We should not be cowed.' A Boatswain's Mate walks the flight deck as an MH-60S Sea Hawk helicopter takes off from the Navy destroyer USS Gravely (DDG-107) in March during the warship's deployment to the Red Sea. (U.S. Navy) Petty Officer 1st Class Jonathan Word At the same time, the Navy shouldn’t 'get cocky' about its performance in the Red Sea, he said. 'Carl von Clausewitz, probably the best strategic thinker of them all, implies that success in warfare is about a 60-40 proposition at best,' Holmes said. 'We can lose, and in fact I think the odds are in China’s favor. When a fraction of one force faces off against the entirety of another, who wins? We are the fraction, China’s PLA has the entirety. That is not the case in the Red Sea.' Still, he said, the Red Sea has provided the surface fleet a taste of what they might meet should war erupt with China. 'We are expending munitions we sorely need, so there is a material dimension to correct,' Holmes said. 'But at the same time, warfare is a human contest. We are getting our people ready to do what they may have to do before long. If we give them the tools, the tool wielders can do the work.' The Navy’s preparations for a potential battle against Chinese forces is accelerating, and the sea service has undoubtedly benefited from taking on a real-life adversary, even one far weaker than the People's Liberation Army. The at-times daily Red Sea conflict may be drawing to a close, with the Houthis announcing they would halt such attacks following a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. However it ends, the surface fleet has seen sustained combat for the first time in decades and shaken off the peacetime cobwebs in the process, a process that has provided great experience, a tsunami of data, and a sobering look at how prepared the surface fleet is to face-down a far more powerful foe.

Boom! The XB-1 Demonstrator Jet Has Gone Supersonic	Boom Supersonic’s XB-1 demonstrator has broken the sound barrier, marking a major milestone in the effort that hopes to lead to a larger 55-seat supersonic airliner design known as Overture. Overall, the program could have significant implications not only for commercial aviation but also for the military. Boom Supersonic’s XB-1 demonstrator eases past the sound barrier for the first time, going supersonic just over 11 minutes into its sortie today. YouTube screencap The aircraft was flown to a speed of Mach 1.1 by former U.S. Navy aviator and Boom test pilot Tristan 'Geppetto' Brandenburg, from the Mojave Air & Space Port, California. For the majority of its flight, the XB-1 was accompanied by two other supersonic jets, an ATAC Mirage F1 flown by A.J. 'Face' McFarland, serving as primary safety chase, and a T-38 Talon performing photo chase duties. During the flight, the XB-1 entered the supersonic realm three times, landing safely at Mojave after a flight of a little over 30 minutes duration.

The XB-1, also known as the 'Baby Boom,' is a one-third-scale technology demonstrator for the Overture. It made its first flight at Mojave on March 22, 2024, as you can read about here. During that flight, the XB-1 was flown at speeds up to 238 knots (273 mph, or Mach 0.355), achieving an altitude of 7,120 feet. On that occasion, Chief Test Pilot Bill 'Doc' Shoemaker was at the controls, while the flight was monitored by 'Geppetto' Brandenburg, flying a T-38 Talon chase aircraft. A video showing the first flight of the XB-1, on March 22, 2024: Boom Supersonic rolled out the XB-1, which carries the U.S. civil registration code N990XB, on October 7, 2020. The company first said it was developing this demonstrator in November 2016, some eight months after announcing its plans for the Overture. While we have outlined the key aspects of the XB-1 in the past, the aircraft is 62.6 feet long and its elongated delta-wing planform has a wingspan of 21 feet. It makes extensive use of sophisticated technologies, including carbon-fiber composites, advanced avionics, and digitally optimized aerodynamics. The XB-1 during an earlier test flight. Boom Supersonic It also has an unusual propulsion system to propel it into the supersonic regime. This comprises three General Electric J85-15 turbojets, which together provide more than 12,000 pounds of thrust. The widely used J85 also powers, among others, the Northrop F-5 and the T-38. Since the XB-1 was rolled out, another three-engined aircraft has broken cover, the Chinese advanced tailless combat aircraft tentatively known as the J-36. Compared to the XB-1, the Overture will be 201 feet long and is planned to achieve a cruising speed of Mach 1.7 (1,304 miles per hour) and a maximum speed of Mach 2.2. The company anticipates it will have a maximum range of 4,500 nautical miles. A rendering of Boom Supersonic’s Overture airliner. Boom Supersonic Achieving the Mach 1 mark is a huge achievement for the company and an important statement of intent for the future Overture supersonic airliner. Aimed to make supersonic travel more affordable to greater numbers of travelers — a goal in which no other operator has succeeded in the past — the Overture is planned to carry a total of 64-80 passengers. Intended to drastically shorten the duration of transoceanic routes, the aircraft is 'designed… to be profitable for airlines at fares similar to first and business class,' the company’s website notes. The last time this kind of performance was available to paying passengers, was aboard the Anglo-French Concorde. A seat on this iconic airliner cost multiple times that of an equivalent business-class fare and it was retired from commercial supersonic flight in late 2003.

However, it completed only around 100 commercial flights, only around half of them carrying passengers, before being relatively quickly relegated to cargo-carrying duties. It saw out its career as a supersonic research aircraft, including on behalf of NASA. A Soviet Tupolev Tu-144 supersonic airliner, at Schoenefeld Airport, East Germany.

It further states on its website that 'Overture’s order book stands at 130 orders and pre-orders,' with commitments from American Airlines, United Airlines, and Japan Airlines. Boom says it is slated to roll out the first Overture in 2026, with test flights to commence in 2027, and type certification expected by 2029. All this remains highly ambitious, with plenty more hurdles to negotiate, and we shouldn’t be surprised if that timeline fails to be met. Boom Supersonic Outside of the commercial market, potential military applications of the Overture shouldn’t be overlooked. Since 2020, Boom has been working with the U.S. Air Force with a view to a potential version of the Overture for high-speed executive flight. While moving government officials around at supersonic speed would be a unique and highly prestigious capability, the Overture design also offers potential for the rapid transit of cargo, as well as personnel, capabilities the Air Force has also been eyeing. In July 2022, Northrop Grumman and Boom announced a collaboration to develop a variant of the Overture specifically for the U.S. and allied military forces. At the time, Boom noted that a military variant would be ideal for 'rapid-response missions.' A pilot’s eye view of XB-1’s tenth test flight, narrated by Chief Flight Test Engineer Nick Sheryka: 'Fitted with specialized capabilities, the aircraft could be used to deliver medical supplies, provide for emergency medical evacuation, or surveil vast areas faster than conventional aircraft,' the company said. 'The special mission Overture variant could also be used to coordinate other aircraft and ground assets in a variety of scenarios.' Since then, there have been more efforts to progress the development of 'defense variants' of the Overture. In September 2023, Boom announced the launch of its Defense Advisory Group, building on its collaboration with Northrop Grumman. The group aims to help identify unspecified 'national security missions' the aircraft could be used for. A wind tunnel model of the Boom Supersonic XB-1 is displayed during the Farnborough Airshow, southwest of London, on July 16, 2018. TOLGA AKMEN/AFP via Getty Images TOLGA AKMEN But like the commercial applications of the Overture, the prospect of getting a militarized version off the ground is also fraught with difficulties. Back in 2017, Lockheed Martin announced that it was working with Aerion to develop the AS2 supersonic business jet — a primarily commercial aircraft that could have military applications. At the time, we outlined the various ways in which its capabilities could be harnessed by the U.S. military, only for Aerion to go out of business in 2021. A rendering of the Aerion AS2 in a U.S. military livery. Aerion Ultimately, despite the undoubted military potential of the Overture — or developments of it — it will be the commercial marketplace where the program succeeds or fails. The history of prior programs demonstrates just how difficult it is to make commercial supersonic flight a reality, especially an affordable one. That, however, remains Boom’s primary aim. For now, however, it’s very much worth reflecting on Boom Supersonic’s achievement of breaking the sound barrier with its XB-1. Whatever the future has in store for this ambitious program, the exotic test jet is sure to capture imaginations like the supersonic pioneers that came before it.

Billions For Next Generation Fighter Jet Engines Greenlit By Air ...	The U.S. Air Force has dramatically plussed-up contracts with General Electric and Pratt & Whitney, both of which now have a ceiling of $3.5 billion, to continue work on prototype next-generation jet engines. To date, the Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion (NGAP) program has been focused primarily on developing new engines to power a new sixth-generation crewed stealth 'fighter' in the works as part of the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative. The NGAD combat jet's future is now an open question, but NGAP might also feed into other advanced aviation programs. The Pentagon announced the modifications to the existing NGAP deals in its daily contracting notice today. Both are described as funding additional 'technology maturation and risk reduction services' in support of work on prototype engines. A notional sixth-generation stealth combat jet. Collins Aerospace The specific entry for the modification to the NGAP contract with Pratt & Whitney (a subsidiary of Raytheon) provides the following additional context: 'The work includes design, analysis, rig testing, prototype engine build and testing, and weapon system integration. The contract modification is for the execution of the prototype phase of the Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion program and is focused on delivering a state-of-the-art propulsion system with a flexible architecture that can be tailored for future combat aircraft operating across various mission threads; and digitally transforming the propulsion industrial base.' An engine test rig at the U.S. Air Force's Arnold Engineering Development Complex (AEDC) in 2017 used to support work on Pratt &#038; Whitney's XA101 engine. The company is leveraging work on the XA101 for its NGAP design. USAF The U.S. Air Force first awarded the NGAP contracts to General Electric and Pratt & Whitney in 2022. At that time, additional NGAP contracts also went to Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman, the three prime contractors vying at that point to develop the NGAD combat jet, to help ensure the next-generation engines would be compatible with their respective designs. Each of those deals had an initial ceiling of close to $1 billion. Details about the NGAP designs from General Electric and Pratt & Whitney, known as the XA102 and XA103, respectively, remain limited. The XA102 passed a major design review in 2023 and the XA103 did the same last year. They both leverage work on earlier engines that the two companies developed as potential options for re-engining F-35 Joint Strike Fighters as part of the Air Force's Adaptive Engine Transition Program (AETP). In 2023, the Air Force announced its intention to cancel AETP in favor of upgrading the existing Pratt & Whitney F135 engine currently used on all variants of the F-35. Congress subsequently authorized additional funding for AETP. An old Air Force briefing slide, dating back to at least 2018, regarding the AETP effort. USAF An old Air Force briefing slide, dating back to at least 2018, that shows potential benefits that could be released through the AETP program and follow-on efforts for various aircraft types, including a future advanced combat jet. USAF Like the XA100 and XA101, the XA102 and XA103 are known to be so-called adaptive cycle designs. What this means in broad strokes is that their bypass ratios can be adjusted on demand while in flight between modes that are more fuel-efficient or provide more power, depending on what the situation requires. For instance, a tactical jet with such an engine could fly in an 'efficiency' mode to an operating area, helping to conserve fuel for when it gets on station, which might include time in a higher-power combat-focused mode. The capabilities adaptive cycle engines offer could be particularly important in a future large-scale conflict, especially one against China across the board expanses of the Pacific, where aerial refueling assets are expected to be increasingly at risk and available bases could be few and far between. General Electric has previously said that its earlier XA100 design is some 25 percent more efficient than the F135 and can also offer between 10 and 20 percent more thrust than the Pratt & Whitney engine in certain flight profiles. You can read more about the XA100 and adaptive cycle technologies here. Despite the new funding, what any future NGAP engine might power is less clear than it was back in 2022. The Air Force launched a deep review of its NGAD combat jet plans last year and it remains unclear how the service under the new Trump administration will proceed. A number of alternatives to the original concept, envisioned as a relatively large and expensive successor to the F-22 Raptor stealth fighter but with an overall different mission set, have been proposed, including a truncated lower-cost design viewed more as a follow-on to the F-35 with a focus on acting as an aerial drone controller. NGAP engines, or derivatives thereof, could still power the NGAD combat jet regardless of its final form. Members of a next-generation family of jet engines, or technologies therefrom, could find their way into other advanced Air Force crewed and uncrewed aircraft, as well. The service is actively working to acquire new Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones and is also eyeing stealthy aerial refueling tankers, though the future of those efforts has also been called into question primarily due to concerns about affordability. The Air Force's budget outlook is complicated by a number of very high-priority, but also very expensive programs, including the B-21 Raider stealth bomber and LGM-35A Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile. The ballooning cost of Sentinel was a key factor in the decision to initiate the NGAD combat jet review. Other branches of the U.S. military could be interested in the NGAP engines or related designs. While the future of the NGAD combat jet is murky, the U.S. Navy has insisted that it will push ahead with its own plans for a sixth-generation carrier-capable stealth 'fighter' commonly referred to now as F/A-XX. At the same time, in an interview with Aviation Week last year, the Navy did say it was looking to chart a course for F/A-XX independent of Air Force efforts, including NGAP.

The contract modifications announced today for the ongoing prototyping effort now cover work through 2032. Whatever ultimately comes of NGAP, the expanded deals with General Electric and Pratt & Whitney show the Air Force is still very committed now to seeing the development of the XA102 and XA103 through to at least the prototype stage.

Rebel Troops Claim Capture Of Congo Border City Stoking Fears Of ...	The M23 rebel group, which has taken control of large parts of the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in recent years, now says it has captured the key city of Goma, the largest in the area, from government forces. While the DRC government earlier today disputed that the city had fallen to the rebels, there’s no doubt that M23 has made a rapid advance in the last days and tensions between the DRC and neighboring Rwanda — which backs M23 — are growing.

Photo by STR / AFP -STR In a statement today, M23 announced it had taken Goma, as the United Nations reported 'mass panic' in the city, with the DRC government describing the insurgency as a 'declaration of war.' 'We urge all residents of Goma to remain calm. The liberation of the city has been successfully carried out, and the situation is under control,' the M23 spokesperson, Lawrence Kanyuka, said on X.

They then called upon the DRC government soldiers — the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC) — to surrender their weapons. The deadline for this expired early Monday morning. According to U.N. peacekeepers, some DRC soldiers gave up their weapons before the deadline. #DRCongo : footage shows government forces surrendering with their weapons held above their heads as they cross the border from #Goma into neighboring #Rwanda. pic.twitter.com/ZclQ466u2n&mdash; Thomas van Linge (@ThomasVLinge) January 27, 2025 Map of the city of Goma in the east of the DRC showing the international airport, central prison, and the border post with Rwanda.

According to the United Nations, M23 now controls key roads in and out of the city and the airport can no longer be used for evacuation and humanitarian efforts. The U.N.’s special representative for Congo told an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council, 'We are trapped.' At the weekend, the U.N. had said it would withdraw all of its non-essential staff out of the city. Head of MONUSCO Bintou Keita tell UNSC:'Today, despite ongoing MONUSCO support to FARDC, M23 and Rwandan forces penetrated Munigi quarter in the outskirts Goma city, causing mass panic and flight amongst the population. Roads are blocked and the airport can no longer be used…&mdash; Sherwin Bryce-Pease (@sherwiebp) January 26, 2025 Despite this, the DRC government today claimed that its forces still control strategic parts of the city including the airport. 'Contrary to the manipulative messages circulating on social networks the FARDC hold the Goma airport… and all the strategic points of the capital of the North Kivu province,' the DRC government said. It added that its army was 'more than determined to defend the homeland at the cost of the supreme sacrifice.' There have been reports today of heavy artillery hitting central Goma, as well as a mass escape from a prison in the city that was holding 3,000 inmates. There are also reports of the power and water supplies having been cut in many areas.

I have not seen the M23 yet.' A local journalist told the BBC today that gunfire was continuing in Goma and the situation was 'complicated.' Meanwhile, the chaplain of a hospital in Goma told the BBC that while 'we still have quite a number of [FARDC] soldiers that have gathered together… a big part of the city is controlled by the rebels.' Tens of thousands of residents have reportedly already fled the city, which was home to more than a million people. This is a continuation of a broader trend in the DRC’s North and South Kivu provinces which border Rwanda. Since the start of the year, more than 400,000 people have been forced from their homes here, according to the U.N., as M23 rebels have continued their advance. Of those displaced, more than 178,000 people were forced to leave their homes in the past two weeks. On the FARDC side, the military governor of North Kivu province, Maj. Gen. Peter Cirimwami Nkuba was killed during fighting against M23 rebels, around eight miles from Goma. He was shot last Thursday, during a visit to the front lines, but his death was only announced today. The FARDC has been seen using rocket artillery and Soviet-era tanks to try and counter the rebel advance, as well as rocket-armed Mi-24 Hind helicopter gunships.

The eastern part of the DRC is rich in mineral resources, control of which has been fought over by various armed groups. As well as the DRC’s own authorities, rebel factions and neighboring countries have been dragged into the fighting. In the process, millions have been killed, with the most violent periods being two major conflicts in the 1990s. The M23 rebel group now in Goma dates back to 2012, when it was formed out of another faction, with the stated goal of protecting the ethnic Tutsi population in the east of the DRC. Most of the M23 fighters are Tutsis who formerly served with Congolese government forces. Although M23 has been forced out of the DRC once before, by 2021 they were ready to launch a new offensive. Both the DRC and the U.N. say that M23 is backed by Rwanda. For its part, Rwanda neither confirms nor denies its direct backing for M23, although it refutes claims that it has sent its own troops across the border to support the rebels. This is despite reports from the U.N. that, as of last year, as many as 4,000 Rwandan troops were in the DRC. Reports today citing unnamed intelligence officials suggest that significant numbers of soldiers from the Rwanda Defense Force have crossed the border to support M23, with their numbers and heavy weapons likely to have significantly helped speed the rebel advance.

Secretary-General António Guterres yesterday called on 'the Rwanda Defense Force to stop supporting the M23 and to withdraw from the territory of the DRC,' in a statement that clearly put at least some of the responsibility for the current violence on Rwanda. Adding to the weight of evidence that Rwandan soldiers are also supporting the M23 offensive was U.N. peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix, who said: 'There’s no question that there are Rwandan troops in Goma supporting the M23. Of course, it’s difficult to tell exactly what the numbers are.' The total number of M23 fighters is generally put at more than 8,000. The Rwandan government has said the latest fighting near its border poses a 'serious threat' to its 'security and territorial integrity.' It has also blamed the DRC for the escalating violence. Today, Rwanda blamed shelling by the DRC for killing five people and injuring 26 in the town of Rubavu, on the Rwandan side of the border. 'They are desperate, fleeing. They are mounting their weapons, indiscriminately shelling into Rwanda, not targeting forces but targeting civilians,' Rwanda’s military spokesperson told Reuters. The current conflict also involves around 14,000 U.N. peacekeepers — under the MONUSCO mission — who are primarily tasked with supporting the FARDC in their campaign against M23. MONUSCO troops had been planning to leave the DRC prior to the latest escalation. It is also worth noting that, despite their numbers, only a portion of the MONUSCO troops are allowed to carry out offensive operations — these are the soldiers assigned to the so-called Force Intervention Brigade.

Separate from MONUSCO is another military force deployed in the eastern DRC — the Southern African Development Community (SADC) — but they have also failed to stop the M23 advance. In recent days, the various peacekeeping forces have reported multiple casualties. South Africa said nine of its soldiers were killed while attempting to prevent the rebel advance on Goma.

The apparent fall of Goma is a significant development in the long-running conflict in the African Great Lakes Region. With the airport apparently shut down and roads blocked, the humanitarian and security hub that operated out of the city, serving much of the surrounding region, will also have to cease operations. Already, the region faces one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, with millions of people displaced. Now, the advance of the M23 rebels is further destabilizing the eastern DRC. As a new insurgency threatens to engulf this part of the country, the fear now is of a potential wider conflict involving both the DRC and Rwanda and potentially other countries in the region.

C-32 Forced To Delay Landing After F-16s Scrambled To Intercept D...	A C-32A VIP transport jet on a special air mission (SAM) had to delay landing at Joint Base Andrews on Saturday because two U.S. Air National Guard F-16C Vipers and a U.S. Coast Guard MH-65 helicopter were scrambled to intercept a 'potential drone' flying near the capital region, according to Air Traffic Control (ATC) audio posted online the internet. The object was observed over Freeway Airport located about 10 miles north of Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, according to that audio. The incident began around 8:30 p.m. Eastern time on Saturday. The C-32A was using callsign SAM47, which makes it clear neither POTUS nor VPOTUS were on board, although it was likely operating in support of the President's movements to the West Coast. 'You can expect some delay, I have a scramble in progress,' an ATC operator told the pilots of SAM47, according to the audio posted by a user named TEEJ on the metabunk.com website. Our friend @Thenewarea51 on X also posted a snippet of the conversation, along with flight tracking data that showed C-32A’s flight path. One of the POTUS backup aircraft SAM47 (C-32A) just happened to try and land at Andrews AFB in DC while returning from California when a potential drone was observed. BLACKJACK 01 (US Coast Guard HH-65 helicopter) was scrambled from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, DC… pic.twitter.com/dcld3JruBG&mdash; Thenewarea51 (@thenewarea51) January 27, 2025 'Just be advised that we have an active scramble about 10 miles north of Andrews and just waiting on the jet to depart there &#8230; active intercept so that is the reason for the delay vector,' the ATC operator explained. The ATC operator told the Coast Guard helicopter, callsign BLACKJACK01 and one of the F-16s, callsign BRAVE01, that the target of interest (TOI) was 'a potential drone [flying at an altitude of] between 5,000 and 6,000' feet. A second Viper, callsign BRAVE02, was also launched to track down the potential drone. 'BLACKJACK01, the TOI is now off about one to two o'clock, four miles south,' the ATC operator told the helicopter, guiding it toward the target. 'It looks like it is in the vicinity of Freeway Aiport,' a privately owned airport in Mitchellville, Maryland. Several minutes later, ATC asked if BLACKJACK01 had intercepted the TOI. 'Negative for BLACKJACK01, negative.' the helicopter responded before being given further guidance from ATC. 'BRAVE01, turn right heading 320 last known radar ping was northwest of your position at six miles,' ATC told the Viper’s pilot. 'BLACKJACK01, navigation is approved and just be advised I'm not showing a target anymore,' ATC told the helicopter a few minutes later. 'No more TOI.' An F-16C from the 113th Wing flies over Washington, D.C. (113th Wing) Eventually, the F-16s returned to their station at Andrews AFB and the MH-65 returned to its base at Reagan International Airport without intercepting the target and the C-32A landed without further incident as well.

The unit's mission is to keep small general aviation aircraft from the capital area. (U.S. Air Force photo by Tech. Sgt. Thomas J. Doscher) A spokesperson for the 89th Airlift Wing at JBA, which is responsible for the presidential airlift unit and its mission, told The War Zone that there was no drone over the base and declined comment about the aircraft that were scrambled. We’ve also reached out to the Air Force, the 316th Wing at Andrews Air Force Base, the 113th Wing, the White House, the FAA, the Coast Guard, U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM), and Freeway Airport for more information about what happened and what response measures were taken. In addition, we contacted the FBI, which is already investigating a wave of drone sightings on the East Coast, to see if they are looking into this incident. The FAA deferred our questions to the Defense Department. The 316th Wing at Andrews Air Force Base deferred our questions to the 89th Airlift Wing. We will update this story with any pertinent information provided. It is unclear what would have happened if either the Vipers or the helicopter actually did intercept the potential drone. However, the incident underscores the challenges of protecting airspace near the capital from these objects and the limitations on counter-drone authorities and capabilities. An often confusing maelstrom of legal and regulatory hurdles that limit how and when active counter-drone defenses of any kind can be employed within the homeland, which you can read more about in our deep dive here. The airspace over the capital region is the nation’s most heavily protected. It is extremely well monitored with counter-drone and specialized optical systems, as well as enhanced radar, and FIM-92 Stinger missiles National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems, or NASAMS stand ready to shoot if need be, in addition to airborne intercept assets. Regardless, smaller, slower drones are very hard to spot even during the day, let alone at night, due to their size and signature, making them extremely hard to intercept. It can also be dangerous because they are so hard to see and fly at much lower speeds than the aircraft intercepting them, especially the Vipers, so midair collisions are a real risk. The MH-65 is on call specifically to intercept low-and-slow moving targets like small light aircraft and the suspected drone, in this case. It's also important to note that even with such an advanced and multi-layered integrated air defense system that cocoons the capital region, false alarms in regard to drones or intruding aircraft do occur. You can read all about one very prominent incident in which this happened and why in this TWZ exclusive. This latest incident took place after a mass wave of drone sightings, mostly over New Jersey and New York. That included sightings over power facilities, Picatinny Arsenal and Trump’s golf course in Bedminster that spurred the FAA to issue scores of Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs). Picatinny received a permanent drone ban over its facility while the other TFRs expired earlier this month without renewal except the one over Bedminster. The president, who had already promised to provide details about these incursions, last week ordered his chief of staff to share findings about those sightings with the public. The potential drone sighting near Andrews Air Force Base also comes after drone incursions in December 2023 over Langley Air Force Base in Virginia, about 130 miles to the south. That event appears to have sparked a major wakeup call within the DoD as to the threat posed by these craft to critical military infrastructure. Many other military installations in the Continental United States, like Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, have also been subjected to drones of unknown origin intruding over their airspace, as had the Air Force’s Plant 42 advanced aerospace development hub in California this past fall. There were also drone incursions over U.S. bases in the United Kingdom in November. The last of those took place on Nov. 26, a spokesperson for the 48th Fighter Wing at RAF Lakenheath told us. The War Zone was the first to report all those incidents. It is unknown at the moment if the incident that took place over the weekend has any connection to any of these prior sightings. However, it is likely to renew concerns about these objects, who is operating them, and whether they pose any real threats.

Russian Withdrawal From Prized Syrian Naval Base Now Underway	Satellite imagery shows clear indications that Russia's increasingly anticipated withdrawal of forces from its Tartus naval base in Syria has finally started. Complete loss of access to the facility, where Russian vehicles and materiel have been massing there for weeks already, would be a major blow to the Kremlin. The Russian military has already been steadily drawing down its posture at Khmeimim Air Base in Syria amid persistent questions about the future of its presence in the country as a whole since the sudden fall of dictator Bashar Al Assad last year. Satellite imagery taken on January 25 that TWZ obtained from Maxar, seen at the top of this story and below, shows the Russian-flagged roll-on/roll-off (RO/RO) cargo ships Sparta and Sparta II docked in Tartus, as well as cargo transloading activity. The two ships had been holding offshore for days before finally being allowed to enter the port. A satellite image taken on January 25, 2025, showing Sparta and Sparta II docked in Syria's port of Tartus. Satellite image ©2025 Maxar Technologies The images also show the disappearance of a significant number of Russian vehicles and other materiel from a pier where they had been marshalled weeks ago.

Satellite image ©2024 Maxar Technologies An additional satellite image taken on January 27 that TWZ reviewed from Planet Labs shows even more vehicles and materiel missing from the pier. A number of vehicles are also now visible arrayed in a row close to the pier edge, which would make them easier to load onto a ship. A large number of shipping containers have also now appeared in another nearby cargo marshaling area, though it is unclear whether or not this is related to the movement of Russian materiel or non-military cargo operations that have now resumed at the port.

Russian naval vessels that were in the port of Tartus when Assad fell left shortly thereafter in another apparent force protection move. Many of them still appear to be holding off the coast, though the Improved Kilo class submarine Novorossiysk has notably left the region. Another Russian RO/RO cargo ship, the Sparta IV, was recently observed leaving the Baltic Sea along with a Russian Navy Ropucha class amphibious warfare ship. These vessels may also be headed for Syria, but this currently remains unconfirmed. Other Russian amphibious warfare ships that could be used to transport cargo out of Tartus have also arrived off the coast of that port in recent weeks. Another Russian-flagged cargo ship, the Ursa Major, which may have been Syria-bound, sank in the Mediterranean in December 2024 under still-murky circumstances as you can read more about here.

The Kremlin had struck the deal back in 2017 with the Assad regime, which had essentially gifted the naval facility, as well as Khmeimim Air Base, to the Russians. Two years earlier, Russia's military launched an invention in the country some two years earlier, which had saved Assad from advancing rebel forces. Russian forces were still actively fighting rebel forces, including elements of the coalition led by Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) that ultimately deposed Assad, right up until the collapse of the regime. As TWZ highlighted even before the fall of Assad's regime in December 2024, Tartus and Khmeimim are strategically very significant for Russia beyond just operations in Syria and the Middle East. The facilities have been particularly important nodes for supporting Russian activity in Africa, especially Libya, where the Kremlin looks to be trying now to bolster its presence. Tartus notably provided the Russian Navy with a key warm water port. Khmeimim, which Russia has notably expanded in recent years, including to help the base be better able to serve larger aircraft like bombers, had also been a valuable point from which to project air power across the Mediterranean and elsewhere. What the final status of the naval base at Tartus and Khmeimim Air Base will look like remains unclear. Russia has, unsurprisingly, voiced clear interest in retaining at least some kind of presence at both facilities and has reportedly been negotiating with the new Syrian authorities in Damascus to this end. For its part, the post-Assad government, led by members of HTS, has previously expressed a willingness to maintain ties with the Kremlin despite open conflict between the two sides just two months ago. A Syrian rebel soldier stands outside the entrance of the port of Tartus in western Syria on December 16, 2024. Bakr ALKASEM / AFP via Getty Images BAKR ALKASEM The situation across Syria is otherwise still extremely fluid, and the new government in Damascus has yet to consolidate control over much of the country. Turkish-backed forces continue to openly fight with Kurdish groups, including elements tied to the U.S.-supported Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), in the north. There has also been talk of integrating the SDF into a new national military. In southwestern Syria, Israel looks to be consolidating its control over territory in an ostensible buffer zone, moves that have been criticized by the HTS-led government and parts of the international community. Israeli, U.S., and other foreign forces have also taken advantage of the newly permissive airspace across Syria to launch airstrikes in support of their national interests. The U.S. military says its focus is on preventing ISIS terrorists from exploiting the situation to regroup and has reportedly shared intelligence with HTS to support that fight. Still, many countries, including Russia and the United States, formally designate HTS as a terrorist group. Major U.S. and other foreign sanctions imposed on the Assad regime also remain in place, though American and European officials have moved to relax and/or suspend them. Whether or not Russia's military presence in Syria is now set to end entirely remains unknown, but after weeks of steady withdrawals from Khmeimim Air Base, the departure of forces from Tartus now looks to be actively underway.

China’s Mysterious Tailless Stealth Fighter Has Swiveling Wingtip...	A new photo of the still-mysterious Chinese tailless combat aircraft, likely from the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation, which first surfaced last month, provides a better view of the rear aspect of the jet. The image would appear to confirm that the aircraft’s outer wingtip sections act as moving control surfaces, as we had previously suggested was a high possibility. You can read our full extremely in-depth analysis on both of China's new stealthy tailless tactical jets here. The photo in question was first published on the Chinese microblogging website Weibo. The aircraft is seen on approach to land, passing over a busy highway in daylight. Since it first appeared, some observers have suggested the jet may be designated J-50 (in the Chinese Jianjiji or fighter series), while others have referred to it as the J-XDS. At this stage, we simply don’t know for sure. A new photo shows the Chinese tailless combat aircraft, likely from the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation, from the rear aspect. via X While it’s worth noting that the authenticity of the photo cannot be confirmed, there’s nothing to suggest that it’s been manipulated and it’s otherwise in line with the imagery of the aircraft that we have seen before. Via ACuriousPLAFan/SDF:'A rear view photo of J-XDS, posted by Cute Orca on Weibo with the caption 'If this is not a PS-ed photo, this shows that the J-XDS has full-moving wingtips and no angled vertical stabilizers.'' pic.twitter.com/W8UEmA2Twc&mdash; @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) January 27, 2025 Seen here from the rear aspect, there is no sign of the ‘pop-out’ maneuvering tail surfaces that some had suggested might be present and which had also appeared in ‘fan art’ of the same aircraft. The suggestion was that such surfaces might sit flush with the inner wing area, before being activated for low-speed flight, increasing control authority and maneuverability. As we explained in our analysis feature, this didn’t seem to be the case and this photo helps disprove this claim further — especially since the aircraft is seen in a low-speed phase of flight when such control surfaces would be deployed. A fan art render shows an imagined configuration with ‘pop-out’ maneuvering tails, something that we can now more or less rule out: Just wow! SAC J-50 rendering with foldable tails pic.twitter.com/iCHMZZ32Lz&mdash; Húrin (@Hurin92) January 1, 2025 As we pointed out in the past, having these auxiliary tail surfaces would add more weight and complexity to the design, and also decrease fuel storage, which would likely not be worth any advantages they would bring in terms of stability and agility. The apparent confirmation that the aircraft has swiveling outer wingtip sections, which serve as major control surfaces, is significant. In this photo, the tip of the right wing can be clearly seen in a front-up, rear-down position. Having extremely widely spaced surfaces that span from the leading edge to the trailing edge like this should provide a lot of roll authority and, when deployed together, should also be used to control pitch. In this way, the outer wing sections — combined with an advanced digital flight control system — would help mitigate the stability issues that come with a tailless design. An earlier rear-aspect view of the reported Shenyang combat aircraft design. From this angle, a prominent flight-test data probe can be seen on the nose. via X The disadvantage of this arrangement is a likely reduction in low observability, although the designers will have presumably decided that the compromise is worthwhile, especially if it is a requirement of the tailless configuration. This could be reduced in cruise to some degree by limiting the articulation of these surfaces, or even locking them out entirely unless a severe input is commanded. Still, just having a jointed area in this location is less than desirable in a similar manner to how canards are not conducive to extreme radar signature reduction goals. Aside from this, the new photo probably also provides us with our best look at what could be a cockpit canopy, which was not very discernible in previous images. While it’s again hard to determine any details, a prominent bulge does at least seem to be present where a cockpit should be. There has been some speculation that this aircraft could be uncrewed. This doesn’t seem to be the case by anything we are seeing, but it’s always possible as the bulge could also accommodate a satellite communications package. Once again, this is very unlikely at this time. An earlier view of the reported Shenyang design accompanied by a Flanker chase plane. The high/mid-set wing appears to be a modified ‘lambda’ design. via X The low resolution of the photo means it’s hard to determine much about the configuration of the fighter’s engine exhausts, although the suggestion, once again, is that the twin powerplants are provided with 2D thrust-vectoring nozzles very similar to those found on the U.S. F-22 Raptor. This would also help with stability and maneuverability. The thickness of the fuselage — another aspect we discussed in our deep-dive analysis piece — is also showcased in this new image. Another previous underside view of the aircraft provides a suggestion of the complex arrangement of control surfaces across the trailing edge of the wing, as well as the movable wingtips. via X As well as contributing to low observability, engine nozzles of this kind would enhance the aircraft’s maneuverability and stability, key concerns considering that it’s a relatively heavy, tailless design. Overall, there remain many unknowns about this, the second Chinese tailless combat aircraft to break cover last December 26. However, more photos are sure to emerge and these should gradually provide us with a much better idea about its design, as well as provide a hint toward its potential capabilities and anticipated role.

Bunker Talk: Let’s Talk About All The Things We Did And Didn’t Co...	Welcome to Bunker Talk. This is a weekend open discussion post for the best commenting crew on the net, in which we can chat about all the stuff that went on this week that we didn’t cover. We can also talk about the stuff we did or whatever else grabs your interest. In other words, it’s an off-topic thread. The caption to this week’s top shot reads: NANTWICH, ENGLAND - MAY 24: The ballistic missile early warning control centre inside the former RAF Hack Green secret nuclear bunker on May 24, 2023 in Nantwich, England. Hack Green played a central role in the defence of Britain for almost sixty years. It was chosen during WW2 to protect the land between Birmingham and Liverpool from hostile attack and as a location for the new RADAR equipment. The bunker went on to be used for shelter and protection during the Cold War. As relations between East and West thawed many of the UK's nuclear bunkers were sold off. The Secret Bunker is now privately owned by the Siebert family and is run as a museum trust. Also, a reminder: Prime Directives! If you want to talk politics, do so respectfully and know that there’s always somebody that isn’t going to agree with you. If you have political differences, hash it out respectfully, stick to the facts, and no childish name-calling or personal attacks of any kind. If you can’t handle yourself in that manner, then please, discuss virtually anything else. No drive-by garbage political memes. No conspiracy theory rants. Links to crackpot sites will be axed, too. Trolling and shitposting will not be tolerated. No obsessive behavior about other users. Just don’t interact with folks you don’t like. Do not be a sucker and feed trolls! That’s as much on you as on them. Use the mute button if you don’t like what you see. So unless you have something of quality to say, know how to treat people with respect, understand that everyone isn’t going to subscribe to your exact same worldview, and have come to terms with the reality that there is no perfect solution when it comes to moderation of a community like this, it’s probably best to just move on. Finally, as always, report offenders, please. This doesn’t mean reporting people who don’t share your political views, but we really need your help in this regard. The Bunker is open!

Russians Enter Last Major Ukrainian Stronghold In Key Eastern Sec...	Russian forces have entered the Donetsk Oblast town of Velyka Novosilka, according to Russian and Ukrainian sources. The settlement is Ukraine’s last major stronghold in the southern Donbas region. Located at the intersection of Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Dnipropetrovsk Oblasts, its capture could provide Russian forces with a potential route for advancement into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Ukrainian military analysts say, according to Euromaidan Press. 'Military personnel of the ‘Vostok’ group continue to hack into the defense of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Velyka Novosilka,' the Russian MoD claimed on Telegram. 'Servicemen from the ‘East’ military group installed the Russian flag on one of the buildings recaptured from the enemy in the center of the settlement.' The Ukrainian DeepState open-source tracking group confirmed that assessment, saying 'The enemy is successful in advancing on the eastern outskirts, and has also occupied a small part of the central streets of the settlement, where they filmed their videos with rags.' Video emerged on social media appearing to back up that claim.

'Velyka Novosilka is the last large, well-prepared line of defense and logistics hub of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the South Donetsk direction,' the MoD stated. Though the Russians are in the middle of the settlement, fighting for its control still rages. A day earlier, a Ukrainian military official expressed concern that the settlement could be encircled. 'The Russians are conducting mixed assaults, using both infantry and equipment,' said Viktor Tregubov, a representative of the Ukrainian Khortysya operational-strategic group, according to Radio Liberty. 'There are actually a lot of problems there. Velyka Novosilka is now in a rather difficult situation.' The situation is 'dynamic, difficult,' he added, because 'the Russians have a large quantitative advantage, in particular, in personnel.' Russian soldiers raise the flag in Velyka Novosilka pic.twitter.com/skcSboMMjX&mdash; LogKa (@LogKa11) January 24, 2025 Making matters worse, the geographical layout of the area, including a river that cuts through the village, complicates defensive maneuvers, Trehubov noted. As part of its effort to surround Velyka Novosilka, Russian troops are attempting to take control of access routes to the village through heavy fire, he added. Though the town is imperiled, some well-regarded Russian milbloggers say tough fighting remains. 'It is too early to talk about the liberation of the village, but the enemy no longer has a coherent defense,' Oleg Sarov said on Telegram. 'Fighting is going on throughout the village, the enemy is holding a number of concrete pillboxes, but Russian attack aircraft are gradually advancing. The controlled territory in the center is expanding, the flag is raised over the stadium in the eastern part.' While the Russians are making grinding advances across the eastern part of Ukraine, officials in Kyiv are particularly concerned that the fall of Velyka Novosilka could have a cascading effect. A Russian advance into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, which is solidly controlled by Ukraine, will further complicate Ukraine’s ability to defend its eastern region. The settlement of Velyka Novosilka is in a key sector of the eastern front. (Google Earth) This all comes as both sides are jockeying for position ahead of any possible ceasefire negotiations engineered by U.S. President Donald Trump. You can read more about that later in this story. The Latest Russian forces continue to have slow, halting momentum across most of the eastern front while making no gains to the south. Here are some of the key takeaways from the latest Institute for the Study of War (ISW) assessment. Kursk: Russian forces recently advanced in the Ukrainian salient in Kursk Oblast amid continued fighting in the area on January 23. Kharkiv: Russian forces continued limited ground attacks in the Kharkiv direction on January 23 but did not advance. Luhansk: Russian forces continued offensive operations in the Lyman, Kupyansk and Borova directions on January 23 but did not make confirmed advances. Donetsk: Russian forces continued limited ground attacks near and in Kurakhove, Chasiv Yar, southeast of Siversk near Ivano-Darivka on January 23 but did not advance. However, they recently gained ground in northern Toretsk and southwest of the town as well as southwest of Pokrovsk. Zaporizhzhia: Neither Russian nor Ukrainian sources reported ground activity in western Zaporizhia Oblast on January 23. Kherson: Russian forces continued limited ground attacks in the Dnipro direction in Kherson Oblast on January 22 and 23 with no advances reported.

'The year was very tense. It took place in conditions of constant active actions of the enemy, they attacked, we defended,' Oleksandr Syrskyi told Radio Bayraktar. 'But we also had some good news when we conducted a successful counter-offensive, an offensive operation in the Kursk sector, which greatly motivated our military personnel&#8230; And gave us hope that this offensive will not be the last.' The main conclusion of the Kursk operation, Syrsky added, is the need to prepare not only for defense but also for offense.

Deputy Head of the Office of the President Colonel Pavlo Palisa, speaking for the first time since assuming the position, said Ukraine is exploring new recruitment options because the current drafting system inherited from Soviet times is hindering progress. 'While Ukraine passed a mobilization law last spring and lowered the age of conscription from 27 to 25 years old, the measures have not had the impact needed to replenish its ranks or replace battlefield losses in its war with Russia,' the AP noted. The issue has been a huge point of contention with the U.S. and allies, who have urged Zelensky to increase the pool of recruits. However, even Ukrainian troops are beginning to wonder if this will be too little, too late.

A total of 121 drones were intercepted and destroyed, the MoD stated, while Ukraine claims the attack caused widespread damage. The Russian MoD says that Ukraine struck Bryansk, Ryazan, Kursk, Saratov, Rostov, Moscow, Belgorod, Voronezh, Tula, Oryol, Lipetsk and Crimea. The drones sparked fires at the Ryazan Oil Processing Company and the Ryazan oil pumping station and damage to the Kremniy El microelectronics plant in Russia’s Bryansk Oblast, according to the Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff. 'The plant produces a wide range of microchips and components used in strategically important weaponry systems,' the General Staff stated. 'In particular, the Topol-M’ and ‘Bulava,' rocket systems and the S-300 and S-400 surface-to-air missiles systems, as well as in onboard electronics of combat aircraft.' There was also 'damage to the Ryazan Thermal Power Plant, the Investigative Committee building on Krasnoarmeyskaya Street in Bryansk, and the building of the Institute of Management and Business on 2-aya Pochepskaya Street (also located in Bryansk),' the ASTRA news outlet reported on Telegram. In addition, 'ASTRA sources report that three tanks and a kerosene production unit were damaged at the Ryazan Oil Refinery.' 121 drones attacked russia this night.The following regions were affected:Bryansk region,Ryazan region,Kursk region,Saratov region,Rostov region,Moscow region,Voronezh region,Tula region,Oryol region,Lipetsk region,Crimea. pic.twitter.com/QD2mhGSSyl&mdash; Jürgen Nauditt (@jurgen_nauditt) January 24, 2025 Ukraine bombed #Ryazan and #Bryansk with long-range kamikaze drones last night.Day by day, the entire Russian economic basis gets entirely destroyed by Ukraine.Putin can only watch his country burning & inflation skyrocketing as he keeps invading Russia's Western neighbour. pic.twitter.com/v0PI2stbCK&mdash; Julian Röpcke (@JulianRoepcke) January 24, 2025 Russia suffered the most massive drone attack since the beginning of this year.

'I cannot but agree with him that if he had been president – if his victory hadn’t been stolen in 2020 – then maybe there would not have been the crisis in Ukraine that emerged in 2022,' the Russian leader suggested to a reporter on Friday. Putin also lavished praise on Trump, extolling their relationship and blaming former President Joe Biden for not agreeing to meet with him.

Trump Posts From His Truth Social (@TrumpDailyPosts) January 22, 2025 Trump also lashed out at Zelensky, saying the Ukrainian president is partly to blame for the war. 'He wants to settle now, he’s had enough,' Trump said of the Ukrainian leader in an interview with Fox News. 'He shouldn't have allowed this to happen either…He's no angel, but he shouldn't have allowed this war to happen.' During the interview, Trump chided Zelensky for taking on a much bigger enemy. 'First of all, he's fighting a much bigger entity, okay, much bigger when he was, you know, talking so brave,' Trump stated. 'So now two things happened. They were brave, but we gave them billions of dollars. The United States spent $200 billion more than Europe. Why did we spend more? You know why? Because Biden never asked Europe to spend more.' Instead of fighting, Trump suggested that Zelensky should have made a deal with Russia. 'Zelensky was fighting a much bigger entity, much bigger, much more powerful,' Trump posited. 'He shouldn't have done that, because we could have made a deal, and it would have been a deal that would have been, it would have been a nothing deal. I could have made that deal so easily. And Zelensky decided that ‘I want to fight.’' 'You know, they have 30,000 army tanks. Russia has 30,000 army tanks,' Trump continued. 'Zelensky had none practically. Then we started pouring equipment, pour and pour and pour. And they had the bravery to use the equipment. But in the end, this has to be settled.'

'Sounds likely,' he said in a terse response when asked by a reporter if he would take such a step. Trump says he considers new sanctions on Russia 'likely' if Putin refuses negotiations.'Zelensky told me he wants to make a deal, I don’t know if Putin does … He might not.

The Kremlin accepts that individual NATO nations can continue to send weapons to Ukraine as part of bilateral security agreements, but those weapons 'should not be used against Russia or to recapture territory,' one of the sources told Bloomberg. Russia will allegedly demand that Ukraine cut its ties with NATO and become 'a neutral state with a limited military' during talks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 15, citing its sources. The Kyiv Independent (@KyivIndependent) January 15, 2025 During a fiery speech at Davos earlier this week, Zelensky urged Europe to do more to take care of itself. 'Most of the world’s now thinking – so, what’s gonna happen to their relationship with America?' Zelensky asked rhetorically. 'What will happen to alliances? To support? To trade? How does President Trump plan to end wars? But no one is asking these kinds of questions about Europe. And we need to be honest about that.' 'Europe can’t afford to be second or third in line for its allies,' he added. 'If that happens, the world will start moving forward without Europe, and that’s a world that won’t be comfortable or beneficial for Europeans.' Zelensky really hammered Europe in his Davos speech, addressing its future and the threats facing it.'Right now, all eyes are on Washington. But who’s actually watching Europe at the moment?' Here are some highlights from his speech Christopher Miller (@ChristopherJM) January 21, 2025 After leading his country through nearly three years of war, Zelensky is seeing his star sheen wear off and is facing a tough reelection. '&#8230; opposition figures have not failed to notice how setbacks in the war have whittled away at Mr. Zelensky’s popularity,' The New York Times recently noted. Under the Constitution, elections must be called after martial law is lifted, the publication pointed out. Parliament first imposed martial law in February 2022, after the full-scale Russian invasion, and extends it with periodic votes. 'By one measure, Mr. Zelensky still has the support of a majority of Ukrainians, albeit a slim one: 52 percent still have trust in the president, according to a poll in December by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology,' the Times reported. Polling data focusing on a hypothetical election shows Zelensky trailing a former commander in the military, Valery Zaluzhny, the Times stated. Zelensky fired Zaluzhzny as part of a sweeping overhaul of the military command and is now Ukraine’s ambassador to Britain. One survey, by the polling agency Leading Legal Initiatives, 'showed Mr. Zaluzhny winning a hypothetical first round of a two-stage election with 24 percent of the vote,' the Times explained. 'Mr. Zelensky trailed, with 16 percent; and [former Prime Minister Yulia] Tymoshenko, the opposition figure, came in third place with 12 percent. Neither Mr. Zaluzhny nor Ms. Tymoshenko has declared an intention to run.' Zelensky's waning popularity may be extending abroad too. Unlike former Tymoshenko, who attended some of Trump's inaugural events, Zelensky was not invited and said he would only come if he was.

Army Rangers Used Gun-Toting Fire Engine Ladders Mounted On Amphi...	In addition to kickstarting the liberation of Western Europe, the Allied invasion of Normandy in World War II, now best known as D-Day, is famous for the many specialist vehicles that were developed to ensure it went to plan. Alongside the various ‘Funny’ Tanks that played an important role in the amphibious landings, there was a truly bizarre version of the DUKW (or ‘Duck’) amphibious truck, outfitted with an extension ladder to scale cliffs in northern France and then rain down suppressive fire on the German defenders. A photo taken of one of the ladder-equipped DUKW vehicles during a training exercise before D-Day. The gunner has climbed to the top of the ladder to operate the guns. Public Domain Before looking at the little-known modification of the DUKW, it’s worth recalling the huge efforts that went into developing a range of specialized vehicles to support the D-Day landings, which posed some enormous challenges. As well as getting from the landing craft to the beach, these vehicles would have to battle with extensive German coastal defenses, while also negotiating soft sand and shingle and a range of beach obstacles. Someone must have said 'no' to the idea. (A Swan: a DUKW fitted with a 100 feet extensible ladder.) #WW2 #HISTORY pic.twitter.com/xJuWw72Pcz&mdash; RG Poulussen (@rgpoulussen) June 21, 2024 Among the more celebrated of the D-Day ‘Funnies’ were the Duplex Drive (DD) ‘swimming’ amphibious tanks, mine-clearing flail tanks, armored engineer vehicles to smash through beach defenses, including bunkers and gun emplacements, and carpet-layer tanks that could place reinforced matting across soft beaches to allow other heavy armor to follow. A British Army Valentine DD amphibious tank, with its flotation screen erected, moves in the water alongside a landing craft, in January 1944. Public Domain The cliff-assault version of the DUKW was tailored for the very specific role of scaling the Pointe du Hoc, a 110-foot cliff that was roughly midway between Utah and Omaha Beaches, on the northwestern coast of Normandy. This formed part of the Germans’ Atlantic Wall fortifications. At the top of the cliff, the Germans had assembled six 155mm coastal artillery guns, defended from ground assault by infantry and from air attack by 20mm anti-aircraft cannons. There was also an assortment of bunkers and machine gun posts. The approximate location of the Pointe du Hoc, roughly midway between Utah and Omaha Beaches, on the northwestern coast of Normandy. Tom Fish, geo.fish // Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0 By D-Day, on June 6, 1944, the 155mm guns had been moved inland but it was determined that the cliff top would still need to be taken by ground forces, to prevent the Germans from using this strategic position against the Allied invasion force. After all, the Germans had begun to install four new casemates on the cliff top and it would have been possible to move the 155mm guns, or alternative weapons back there. A view of the Pointe du Hoc today reveals something of the challenge of scaling the cliffs. Myrabella / Wikimedia Commons / CC BY-SA 3.0 As for the DUKW, this vehicle was already well-established for amphibious operations. Based on the 2½-ton CCKW truck from the General Motors Corporation (GMC), it was a six-wheel-drive amphibious vehicle. Its main amphibious assault role was to take supplies from ships anchored offshore and bring them directly to the beachhead. Before D-Day, DUKWs had been used at Guadalcanal in the Pacific and in the invasion of Sicily. A standard DUKW amphibious truck carries a load of blood and medical personnel from a landing beach during the invasion of southern France, in August 1944. U.S. National Archives Among the best accounts of the DUKW’s role in the assault on Pointe du Hoc is provided by the website Mike’s Research, with the article on this topic worth reading in full. The assault was to be made by the U.S. 2nd Ranger Battalion under the command of Lt. Col. James Earl Rudder. The force was to be divided into three separate elements that would land below the cliff, to the east, and to the west, respectively. These elements would arrive aboard 10 Landing Craft, Assault (LCA), with additional supplies carried in two more LCAs. The force would also be provided with four special DUKWs, each of which had a 100-foot extension ladder. Befitting the innovative and somewhat ad-hoc approach to the D-Day ‘Funnies,’ these ladders were obtained from the London Fire Brigade, apparently taken from that service’s Dennis Merryweather Turntable Ladder trucks. A map of the assault plan for the Pointe du Hoc. Public Domain The plan for the assault on Pointe du Hoc called for the Rangers to assemble at the beach below, and then scale the cliffs using ropes, ladders, and grapples. This would have to be done while under fire, before neutralizing the German positions and defending them until reinforcements arrived. As well as their ladders, the modified DUKWs also had armament, to provide suppressive fire. Nevertheless, it was a huge ask for the soldier at the top of the ladder to operate these weapons as they teetered toward the top of the cliff, while on the receiving end of German defensive fire. While accounts differ, it seems almost certain the weapons on the top of the adapted DUKW’s ladder were British-made Vickers K machine guns, also known as the Vickers Gas Operated. Originally developed to arm aircraft, the weapon, in 0.303in caliber, was likely chosen due to its high rate of fire — 950-1,200 rounds per minute. It also offered a large magazine compared to the more commonly used Bren gun of the same caliber.

Public Domain Richard Ash A poor-quality but nonetheless interesting video showing training for the Pointe du Hoc operation, including the ladder-equipped DUKWs: While the initial installation featured three guns at the top of the ladder and can be seen in pre-assault training videos, this was apparently reduced to a pair of guns for the actual operation. According to the account provided by Mike’s Research, the assault on Pointe du Hoc began at 5:30 a.m., when naval bombardment targeted the invasion beach, including the German positions atop the cliff. Despite covering fire from a pair of U.S. Navy destroyers, and from Allied aircraft, the Rangers’ passage to the beach was far from straightforward. As well as German defensive fire, they had to deal with high waves, and one of the LCAs was sunk, while another took on water and was swamped. Of the LCAs carrying supplies, one was also sunk and the other became so full of water that most of its cargo had to be thrown overboard. Rangers demonstrate the rope ladders they used to scale the cliffs at Pointe du Hoc. U.S. Navy Of the four DUKWs, one was targeted by German 20mm fire and sank, around 300 yards from the shore, at which distance the Rangers’ invasion force started to face mortar and machine gun fire. Nevertheless, the surviving LCAs and DUKWs made it to the beach, at 7:10 a.m. Mortars were used to launch grappling hooks at the top of the cliff and the Rangers started their rope climb to the summit. Unfortunately, the three remaining DUKWs were now stalled along the shoreline, either stranded in the sand or unable to move across the cratered beach. Some accounts suggest that the ladders were not long enough anyway, which would seem plausible considering their 100-foot length and the tops of the cliffs being around 110 feet. A surviving German bunker observation post at the top of the Pointe du Hoc. Archangel12/Wikimedia Commons Thinking quickly, Lt. Col. Rudder ordered the ladders be raised anyway, to provide elevated positions from where the German defenses could be engaged with the mounted guns. As Mike’s Research recounts: 'While perched on the top rungs, brave Rangers sprayed the top of the cliff with automatic rifle fire. While providing fire support from the top of one of the DUKW ladders, Private Malcolm Arnold observed waves of Rangers climbing up the cliff under fire from above and with grenades exploding around them. A number of Rangers fell when the Germans cut their ropes. After the successful cliff assault, the Rangers neutralized the position and later repelled several counterattacks…' A poor-quality but interesting photo of a ladder-equipped DUKW vehicle during a training exercise at the bottom of a cliff, likely on the Isle of Wight, in England. Public Domain While the special DUKWs may not have been used as they were intended, it seems clear they helped bring about a successful conclusion to the operation. Fighting continued into the night of June 6, with the Rangers pinned back on the top of the cliff, some being captured by the Germans. But they held their ground until the 8th when they were relieved by more Rangers as well as U.S. infantry and elements of a tank battalion, which had meanwhile arrived from Omaha beach. The scene at the top of Point du Hoc after relief forces had reached the Rangers. German prisoners can be seen being moved in the background after their capture. Public Domain Although the heavier 155mm guns had already been moved from the top of the cliff, Rangers managed to locate five German guns and destroy them with thermite grenades. By the time reinforcements arrived, of the original force of 225 soldiers that had landed at the Pointe, 77 had been killed, with another 152 wounded. With only four of the ladder-equipped DUKWs known to have been sent into combat, it’s perhaps not surprising that the story of these highly unusual vehicles is now barely known.

Ukrainian Leopard 1 Tank Survived A Dozen Drone Strikes: Report	One of Ukraine’s Cold War-era Leopard 1 main battle tanks survived as many as a dozen hits from Russian first-person view (FPV) attack drones, according to Ukrainian sources. The incident underscores the proliferation of this particular threat on the battlefield but also points to the effectiveness of the ‘up-armored’ version of the venerable Leopard 1, examples of which have received a variety of different protective measures in Ukrainian service. A video published by the Ukrainian Militarnyi news outlet shows the tank in question, repeatedly being struck by drones, in a compilation of footage taken from original Russian sources. While it’s hard to say with certainty that we are seeing the same tank throughout the video, in the first part, at least, the same tank is seen from the perspective of multiple drones in the same location, parked among trees. We then see what’s purportedly the same vehicle moving along a tree-lined road, where it’s again targeted on multiple occasions. According to Ukrainian sources, the tank, a Leopard 1A5, survived no fewer than a dozen hits from the quadcopter-type FPV drones. The tank was first detected by Russian forces while stationary in a treeline. In this position, the Leopard 1 was targeted by five FPV drones. 'The tank withstood three hits to the frontal part, as well as two more to the left side and rear of the hull,' Militarnyi reports. After that, the tank moved away from its initial position on the treeline and began to move along a road. Here it stopped for some reason and came under attack again. It took another three drone hits, apparently to the hull above the engine and transmission compartment. This was still not enough to immobilize it, and it began to move forward again, after which 'two subsequent hits to the same spot stopped the tank and probably caused a fire.' It’s unclear what happened to the tank crew, but the Ukrainian report suggests that they likely escaped from the tank before it was put out of action, noting that most of the hits were not to the crew compartments and the time interval between the drones’ arrivals was sufficient for the soldiers to evacuate. Provided the crew did escape, their survival was certainly helped by the additional protective measures that have been added to the Leopard 1s by the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ Main Armored Directorate.

(Photo by Roman PILIPEY / AFP) ROMAN PILIPEY The most obvious of these modifications in the video is the ‘cope cage’ structure over the turret. These overhead metal screens have become a trademark of Ukrainian and Russian vehicles fighting in Ukraine and are intended to deflect FPV ‘kamikaze’ drones as well as drone-dropped mortars. Further protection is provided by netting, draped over the cage. The up-armored Leopard 1 also features nets elsewhere as well as grille-type slat armor over the more vulnerable rear part of the hull. Slat armor is designed to protect against the shaped charges in many anti-tank rounds, which need to detonate at certain distances from the target to be most effective. In the meantime, shaped charges and repurposed anti-tank projectiles are common payloads for FPV drones, as well.

ERA functions by detonating on impact before the round hits the tank’s hull. The counter-blast effect can disrupt the weapon’s effects or destroy it outright. A Ukrainian Leopard 1A5 almost entirely covered in ERA bricks. via X In the past, we have seen Ukrainian tanks, including Western-supplied ones, covered with an extensive outer layer of Soviet-era Kontakt ERA bricks, also used by Russia to enhance the protection of a range of different platforms. Were it not for these measures, 'the basic version of the Leopard would most likely have been destroyed by the first hits along with the crew,' the Militarnyi report contends. After all, the original Leopard 1 developed in the 1960s was designed to provide protection against very different kinds of threats than those encountered on the battlefield in Ukraine, primarily the main guns of enemy tanks and anti-tank guns.

(Photo by Ronny HARTMANN / AFP) RONNY HARTMANN Other, non-kinetic defensive measures have also been added to fighting vehicles used by both Ukraine and Russia, although the Leopard 1 in the video was apparently not fitted with any kind of electronic warfare equipment to disrupt the control systems of the attacking drones. While this likely reflects the limited availability of these kinds of systems, it should also be noted that Russia is making increasing use of FPV drones controlled using fiber-optic cables, which cannot be disrupted by Ukrainian jamming. Evading FPV drones is now frequently essential for survival in the Russia-Ukraine war and we have previously profiled some other standout incidents, including the Russian T-80 tank that came under sustained attack by a succession of explosive-laden FPV drones before apparently making good its escape. You can see the video of that engagement embedded below.

These were refurbished before being delivered and were also joined by further examples drawn from Belgian and Dutch stocks. The first of these tanks had begun to arrive in Ukraine in the summer of 2023. By providing additional protection, using the package developed by the Main Armored Directorate, Ukraine has demonstrated that the old Leopard 1 can still play a useful role on the battlefield, although its presence also reflects the limited numbers of more modern tanks that Ukraine has available. While 155 Leopard 1s have been made available to Ukraine so far, the country only received 31 U.S.-supplied M1A1 Abrams and 29 Leopard 2A4s. A recent video shows a Ukrainian Leopard 1 engaging Russian soldiers hiding out in a ruined building in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine.: Ukrainian Leopard 1 tank crew of the 1st Tank Battalion of 5th Heavy Mechanized Brigade fires at orcs trying to hide in the ruins of a school. Khurakove direction. January 2025.&mdash; Baba Yaga Fèlla (@babayaga.fellas.social) 2025-01-23T00:59:06.648Z The Leopard 1 is no longer used by Germany, but there are significant numbers available from storage depots. However, the issue of securing ammunition for the older tank’s 105mm rifled main gun could be difficult to resolve in the long term. For now, however, the Leopard 1 remains very much in the thick of the action on the front lines. This recent video provides a remarkable demonstration of the resilience of the tank, once it has been provided with additional Ukrainian-sourced protective measures and once again highlights the ever-present threat of FPV drones on the battlefield.

XQ-67 Drone Getting Overhauled With New Capabilities As Part Of D...	The U.S. Air Force's XQ-67A drone is set to receive modifications and upgrades to demonstrate its ability to perform certain missions as part of a program called Demon Ape. Originally developed as a ‘sensor truck’ for the once-secretive Off-Board Sensing Station (OBSS) program, the stealthy XQ-67A is now being used as a testbed to support the Air Force's larger Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) advanced drone effort. General Atomics, which built the drone, has also confirmed that it served as the basis for its now-in-development CCA design. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) awarded General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. (GA-ASI) a sole-source contract for the Demon Ape-related work on January 17. Demon Ape is actually a forced acronym standing for Demonstration of Autonomous Collaborative Platform Performance and Effectiveness. The XQ-67A broke cover in February 2024, which TWZ was the first to report, and it made its maiden flight later that month. 'The Government currently requires a mix of research and data, hardware, and software in support of continuing the research and development of the XQ-67A,' according to an online notice about the contract award. 'That work consists of integrating specific mission systems and upgrading the vehicle to ensure adequate power generation and thermal management capacity.' A copy of the formal justification for the sole-source contract is attached to the notice, but is heavily redacted. Still, it does provide some additional details, including that the changes to the XQ-67A are tied to at least one specific mission set. 'The Government intends to continue the research and development of the XQ-67A by modifying the aircraft [redacted],' the justification document says. 'For the XQ-67A to perform this mission, the offeror will have to integrate the specific mission systems [redacted] as well as upgrade to ensure adequate power generation and thermal management capacity.' 'At the conclusion of OBSS, the XQ-67A will have designs ready for the integration of mission systems,' the Air Force's justification for the sole-source contract adds. 'Additionally, the XQ-67A will have been integrated with critical mission infrastructure [redacted].' TWZ has reached out to the Air Force and General Atomics for more information. As we have written in the past: '[The] XQ-67A has what could be large side-looking airborne radar (SLAR) apertures on both sides of the forward fuselage, but that these could also be weapons bays. SLAR would make more sense for XQ-67A based on what we know of the Air Force’s separate and secretive Off-Board Sensing Station (OBSS) program under which the drone was developed. At the same time, the spaces along the sides of the forward fuselage could be modular or otherwise readily adaptable. Earlier this year [2024], the Air Force also disclosed the existence of an Off-Board Weapon Station (OBWS) effort related to the OBSS project, as you can learn more about here.' A large aperture or bay is visible on the left side of the forward fuselage in this picture of the XQ-67A. USAF Courtesy photo via USAF The forthcoming modifications and upgrades might include reconfiguring the XQ-67A to be able to demonstrate capabilities more in line with the OBWS concept. If that is the case, that would also bring the drone even more in line with General Atomics CCA design. The Air Force has said it wants its first tranche of CCAs to be focused, at least initially, on serving as air-to-air ‘missile trucks’ that will operate closely with crewed combat jets. Air-to-ground strike, electronic warfare, networking node, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) have also been put forward as potential future CCA mission sets. The Air Force is also running the CCA program in iterative development cycles, with General Atomics along with Anduril now developing designs as part of the initial Increment 1. There is increasing evidence that the requirements for Increment 2 will call for more capable, and by extension more expensive, designs that might be tasked with additional missions. Models of the Increment 1 CCA designs from General Atomics (top) and Anduril (bottom). General Atomics/Jamie Hunter Whatever the new modifications and upgrades to the XQ-67A might entail, the Demon Ape work also looks set to further prove out the so-called 'genus/species' concept central to the OBSS program and a predecessor effort known as Low Cost Attritable Aircraft Platform Sharing (LCAAPS). The basic concept involves the use of a core 'genus' set of components from which multiple 'species' of differently configured drones can be crafted. General Atomics has also been pioneering this concept with its Gambit drone family, which all use a common 'chassis' that includes landing gear, as well as critical mission and flight control computer systems. '[Now former] Secretary of the Air Force, Mr. Frank Kendall, stated that future air dominance will include 'the introduction of uncrewed collaborative aircraft to provide affordable mass and dramatically increased cost effectiveness.' The focus on delivering 'affordable mass' means that novel developmental approaches must be proven to drastically drive down costs,' the justification for the new Demon Ape contract explains. 'Additionally, it is critical to shorten the development timeline, otherwise the Air Force would not be able to deliver enough aircraft to enable mass.' 'As a result of the OBSS program, the Air Force has captured the hardware and software design data in Technical Data Packages, and has that design data. At the hardware level, the system is designed and built around a Genus common platform architecture. The Air Force has rights to the design of the Genus and its technical data,' the justification document adds. 'Development of new Species aircraft variants by other vendors using the Genus as the starting point is possible. The Air Force also has most of the rights to the OBSS Species aircraft variant. Development and insertion of different vendors' technologies or subsystems into the Species is possible. At the software level, the Air Force is requiring insertion of which will allow for integration of software applications, algorithms and skills that could be developed by any vendor. The open nature of the design will allow for competition in these aspects of the project in the future.' USAF The XQ-67A drone seen during its first flight. Courtesy photo via USAF The justification document also highlights 'GA-ASI manufacturing processes' that are 'highly unique' that were used to physically construct the XQ-67. The company has been making significant investments in new and improved rapid design and manufacturing capabilities in recent years. As already noted, the Air Force has previously stated that work on OBSS, to include this kind of modular open-architecture approach, is now feeding into the larger CCA effort. '[Speaking] from the [Air Force] Test Center [AFTC] perspective, but also having some experience with the Lab [the Air Force Research Laboratory; AFRL], we went through a long process of developing that technology,' Air Force Maj. Gen. Scott Cain told The War Zone and other reporters at the Air & Space Forces Association's main annual conference last September. 'Our steps that we took … were proving out that system [the XQ-67] and making sure that it got through that first flight and airworthiness. And now that has been picked up … that program, OBSS, … did a seamless transition over to the CCA program.' 'So the Test Center supported the Lab in getting XQ-67 to that first flight and to do some early characterization of the platform,' Cain, who was then head of AFTC and had previously been in charge of AFRL, added at that time. 'There are other lessons from this about building a common chassis that will be carried forward. And the CCA program is ingesting those and thinking about those for future increments of the system.' As has been mentioned, the Air Force is still very much refining its requirements for CCA's Increment 2. The service also announced additional Increment 1 CCA orders last year that it said would help in the development of new concepts of operations and tactics, techniques, and procedures for the employment of those initial drones. Air Force officials have said that they expect to purchase between 100 and 150 Increment 1 CCAs, in total. A composite of renderings of the CCA designs from General Atomics (at top) and Anduril (at bottom). General Atomics/Anduril Whether the operational Increment 1 CCA force ultimately consists of General Atomics or Anduril types, or a mix of both, remains to be seen. As TWZ has noted before, General Atomics' work on the XQ-67A, both as a flying risk reduction prototype for its CCA design and as a broader testbed, has certainly given the company a running start. General Atomics has decades of additional experience in developing and serial production of other drones, including the famous MQ-1 and MQ-9 families. The Air Force is also still finalizing how the drones will be integrated into its force structure, training cycles, and logistics chains. Technical questions, including those surrounding command and control, from the required communications networking capabilities to physical interfaces human operators will use to manage the drones, need to be answered, as well, as you can read more about here. Outside of the CCA program, the Air Force has a number of efforts underway to help answer these various questions. This includes Demon Ape, which is now set to get a modified and upgraded XQ-67A to continue its work. UPDATE: 2:05 PM EST — General Atomics has now provided us with some additional context about the XQ-67A and the Demon Ape program. 'The Demonstration of ACP Performance and Effectiveness program, also called Demon APE, is the next logical step for the overall CCA concept,' C. Mark Brinkley, a company spokesperson, told TWZ in a statement. 'First, we build and fly this nontraditional unmanned jet in an Off-Board Sensing Station configuration. OBSS has goals that are separate from CCA, but they still live inside this larger concept for the future of air superiority.' 'So you have one modular, central core yielding numerous Autonomous Collaborative Platform configurations. OBSS is a sensor, CCA is a shooter, but you can also have EW, fighter/attack, whatever,' he continued. 'You’re not starting over every time, trying to figure out how to build landing gear and where to put the payloads. The modularity we’ve demonstrated means you can go from new variant to new variant very fast and generate a lot of commonality.' 'Also in parallel, Demon APE is advancing OBSS directly by integrating specific mission systems and upgrades to meet the goals for that program,' he added. 'I can’t talk about what those are specifically, but the name tells you a lot: Off-Board Sensing Station. These new systems require adequate power generation and thermal management, and Demon APE is doing that now.'

North Korean Rocket Launcher Disguised As Civilian Truck May Have...	A North Korean multiple launch rocket system (MLRS) designed to be disguised as a common truck looks to have appeared in Russia’s Kursk region. The unique vehicle's arrival there would be part of Pyongyang’s military support for Moscow’s war effort. We reported just yesterday that North Korea is increasing its supply or artillery troops and hardware to Russia, especially for use in the Kursk region. The 'hiding in plain sight' MLRS based on a civilian truck platform is a concept that we have seen before in North Korea and a cruder version of which has also been previously used in combat by Iraqi militias. N. Korean 122mm MLRS filmed in Kursk. pic.twitter.com/fziMy5lfTW&mdash; 𝔗𝔥𝔢 𝕯𝔢𝔞𝔡 𝕯𝔦𝔰𝔱𝔯𝔦𝔠𝔱△ (@TheDeadDistrict) January 23, 2025 A brief video showing the civilian-truck-based North Korean MLRS began to circulate today on social media. Ukrainian and Russian military bloggers alike have stated that the MLRS was spotted in Kursk, although we cannot currently verify the location in which the footage was shot. The MLRS in the footage certainly appears to be identical to a North Korean one that was first noted during a military parade in Pyongyang, as TWZ reported at the time. During the parade in September 2023 marking the 75th anniversary of North Korea’s founding, the country’s Worker-Peasant Red Guards paramilitary force unveiled a fleet of MLRS disguised as civilian trucks that match perfectly with the vehicle depicted in the video. Worker-Peasant Red Guard rocket launchers concealed within container trucks during a parade in Pyongyang on September 9, 2023. KCNA The weapon in question is based on a box truck with 12 tubes each of what appear to be 122mm artillery rockets deployed via their pop-up and sliding-door roofs. The parade also included a dump truck version of the MLRS, alongside agricultural tractors pulling rocket launchers and anti-tank guided missiles on trailers. North Korean fake dump trucks that can have rocket artillery concealed inside. KCNA North Korean civilian tractors pulling trailers with anti-tank missiles, rocket artillery, and anti-aircraft guns attached. KCNA As we discussed previously, these kinds of weapons make a lot of sense in terms of North Korean operational tactics, masquerading as civilian vehicles before swinging into action should a conflict kick off on the Korean peninsula. Once the fighting has begun, the MLRS could roam around more freely, appearing as a normal truck, then quickly firing, relocating, and doing so repeatedly, making the enemy’s targeting plans that much more complicated. On the battlefields of Ukraine, an MLRS that’s disguised as a civilian truck would also have considerable value. This would apply in the Kursk region, where Russian and North Korean forces are engaged in a counteroffensive against Ukrainian forces that launched an assault there last summer, but also across large swaths of eastern Ukraine that are controlled by Russia. The fact that the MLRS can move around the fringes of where fighting is taking place without necessarily arousing outright suspicion would be a big deal, and this would be aided by the extensive road networks existing in these areas, where, in some cases, there is no shortage of civilian traffic to blend in with. Ukrainian forces are already using considerable resources to try and identify and then engage Russian units — and especially artillery and air defense systems — as they are brought into battle. Having another level of camouflage and concealment would make that even more complicated. Among the lessons of the conflict in Ukraine is the vulnerability of equipment on and around the battlefield, especially to drone attacks, putting huge pressure on keeping equipment out of sight as much as possible, or at least confusing the enemy as to what they are seeing and subsequently prioritizing for targeting. The possibility that any given anonymous-looking truck moving on a road could actually be concealing rocket artillery therefore adds a whole new dynamic. On the other hand, this kind of artillery is far less mobile outside of existing roads compared to traditional MLRS and it’s unclear if it features any kind of protection, even against small-arms fire and shrapnel. That is less of a concern though as 122mm 'Grad' rockets can saturate target areas over ten miles away, allowing them to be employed behind the front lines and towards the extent of many traditional and unassisted first person video drones' practical range. Another view of North Korean rocket launchers concealed within container trucks during a parade in Pyongyang. KCNA It's possible that North Korea may have sent this kind of MLRS to Russia due to availability or perhaps as some kind of combat trial, especially bearing in mind the fact that this is a relatively new system. For the time being, we will have to wait for more evidence to confirm that this type of MLRS is really in the Kursk region and, if so, how it might be employed and by whom. There is, however, a precedent for this type of MLRS being used in combat. Back in 2023, TWZ reported on how Iranian-backed militants in Iraq fired 122mm artillery rockets at U.S.-led coalition forces in neighboring Syria using an improvised array of launchers disguised inside a modified tanker truck. A video clip, seen in the social media post below, emerged showing this vehicle in action.

At least three rockets can be seen still inside the launch tubes. CENTCOM Concealed improvised rocket launchers have been seen on multiple occasions in the hands of Iraqi militants, ever since the immediate aftermath of the U.S.-led invasion of the country in 2003. In the process, various types of commercial trucks have been modified in this way over the years. In the meantime, the concept of concealing weapons in anonymous-looking containers has gained more traction around the world. Most notably, Israel and Russia, among other countries, have developed missile launchers disguised to look like shipping containers, able to be hidden among normal deck cargo or within industrial areas from which to launch attacks. Returning to Ukraine, only yesterday we reported on how North Korea was expected to send reinforcements to Kursk imminently. Kyiv’s military intelligence chief told TWZexclusively that these reinforcements will mostly comprise missile and artillery troops who typically operate hundreds of tubed and rocket artillery systems as well as the KN-23 short-range ballistic missiles Pyongyang has already provided Moscow. The wreckage of a North Korean missile is shown in a briefing dedicated to the Russian shelling of Kharkiv by North Korean missiles on March 14, 2024, in Kharkiv, Ukraine. Photo by Denys Glushko /Gwara Media/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images Global Images Ukraine The artillery was expected to be used to support both North Korean and Russian operations, although the missiles would be reserved for Russian objectives. Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR), also told us that the North Koreans would train Russian soldiers on all of those systems. Aside from the thousands of troops North Korea has now committed to the conflict, especially in the Kursk region, Pyongyang has already supplied Russia with huge amounts of weaponry, including desperately needed artillery rounds and various kinds of other ammunition, amounting to millions of individual projectiles. TWZ has also reported on the appearance of North Korean 170mm M1989 Koksan self-propelled artillery pieces being deployed in the Ukraine war and, more recently, a North Korean-made mobile surface-to-air missile system, the designation of which remains unconfirmed. Again, it’s not clear if these are being used exclusively by North Korean troops or whether they have been supplied to Russia. What is meanwhile clear is that North Korea is stepping up its military support for Russia’s war with Ukraine, including providing an increasingly varied array of heavy weapons.

F-35 AI-Enabled Drone Controller Capability Successfully Demonstr...	Lockheed Martin says the stealthy F-35 Joint Strike Fighter now has a firmly demonstrated ability to act as an in-flight 'quarterback' for advanced drones like the U.S. Air Force's future Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) with the help of artificial intelligence-enabled systems. The company states that its testing has also shown a touchscreen tablet-like device is a workable interface for controlling multiple uncrewed aircraft simultaneously from the cockpit of the F-35, as well as the F-22 Raptor. For the U.S. Air Force, how pilots in crewed aircraft will actually manage CCAs during operations has emerged as an increasingly important question. Details about F-35 and F-22 related crewed-uncrewed teaming developments were included in a press release that Lockheed Martin put out late yesterday that wrapped up various achievements for the company in 2024. Lockheed Martin The F-35 'has the capability to control drones, including the U.S. Air Force’s future fleet of Collaborative Combat Aircraft. Recently, Lockheed Martin and industry partners demonstrated end-to-end connectivity including the seamless integration of AI technologies to control a drone in flight utilizing the same hardware and software architectures built for future F-35 flight testing,' the press release says. 'These AI-enabled architectures allow Lockheed Martin to not only prove out piloted-drone teaming capabilities, but also incrementally improve them, bringing the U.S. Air Force’s family of systems vision to life.' 'Lockheed Martin has demonstrated its piloted-drone teaming interface, which can control multiple drones from the cockpit of an F-35 or F-22,' the release adds. 'This technology allows a pilot to direct multiple drones to engage enemies using a touchscreen tablet in the cockpit of their 5th Gen aircraft.'

USAF A US Air Force image depicting an MQ-28 Ghost Bat flying together with an F-22 Raptor stealth fighter. USAF The press release also highlights prior crewed-uncrewed teaming work that Lockheed Martin's famed Skunk Works advanced projects division has done with the University of Iowa’s Operator Performance Laboratory (OPL) using surrogate platforms. OPL has also been working with other companies, including Shield AI, as well as the U.S. military, to support advanced autonomy and drone development efforts in recent years. In November 2024, Lockheed Martin notably announced that it had conducted tests with OPL that saw a human controller in an L-39 Albatros jet use a touchscreen interface to order two L-29 Delfin jets equipped with AI-enabled flight technology acting as surrogate drones to engage simulated enemy fighters. This sounds very similar to the kind of control architecture the company says it has now demonstrated on the F-35. A view of the 'battle manager' at work in the back seat of the L-39 jet during issuing commands to the L-29s acting as surrogate drones. Lockheed Martin When it comes to the Air Force's CCA program, the effort is currently structured around iterative development cycles, with Anduril and General Atomics developing different drones now under what is known as Increment 1. Dozens of other contractors are working on ancillary developments, including autonomous technologies and control systems. The Air Force is still refining its requirements for Increment 2, but they are increasingly expected to call for more capable uncrewed aircraft designs that will also be more expensive. For its part, Lockheed Martin said last year that its losing pitch for Increment 1 was a very stealthy 'gold plated' drone and that it has since refocused its attention on lower-cost, potentially even expendable designs. Models of the drones General Atomics (at top) and Anduril (at bottom) are developing as part of the CCA program's Increment 1. General Atomics/Jamie Hunter Air Force officials have said that the service could eventually buy between 100 and 150 Increment 1 CCAs, and thousands of drones across all of the programs increments. The F-35 has also been identified in the past as one of the expected initial crewed companions for the drones. Even before the CCA concept was publicly codified, Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works had outlined a detailed crewed-uncrewed teaming vision that included the Joint Strike Fighter. The Air Force is also still very much in the process of developing new concepts of operations and tactics, techniques, and procedures for employing CCA drones operationally. How the drones will fit into the service's force structure and be utilized in routine training and other day-to-day peacetime activities, along with what the maintenance and logistical demands will be, also remain to be seen. Questions about in-flight command and control have emerged as particularly important ones to answer in the near term. 'I was just talking to our program manager downstairs… and we were talking about what we think the number of aircraft, CCAs, that can be controlled by a crewed aircraft [is]. And I initially started out with a range of three to five,' Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall told TWZ and other reporters at the Air & Space Forces Association's (AFA) main annual conference last September. 'We’re talking about bigger numbers than that now. So we’re moving towards greater reliance on uncrewed aircraft working with crewed platforms to achieve air superiority and to do other missions.' 'One of the things you have to have if you’re going to use CCAs and have them be armed and … lethal is that they have to be under tight control. And, for me, one of the elements of that needs to be line-of-sight communications. And I think that that’s an important thing to have in the mix, secure, reliable line-of-sight communications. We’re not going to have aircraft going out and doing engagements uncontrolled,' the Air Force’s top civilian added at that time. 'So the default, if they lose communications, would be for them to return to base, which takes them out of the fight. So we don’t want that to happen. And when they do do engagements, … we want them under tight control. So I think the mix of crewed and uncrewed aircraft, I think, is going to be the right answer for the foreseeable future.' As Lockheed Martin's new touting of its work on tablet-based control interfaces highlights, there is a significant debate now just about how pilots will physically issue orders and otherwise manage drones from their cockpits. A picture of a drone control system using a tablet-like device that General Atomics has previously released. GA-ASI 'There’s a lot of opinions amongst the Air Force about the right way to go [about controlling drones from other aircraft],' John Clark, then head of Skunk Works, also told The War Zone and others at the AFA gathering in September 2024. 'The universal thought, though, is that this [a tablet or other touch-based interface] may be the fastest way to begin experimentation. It may not be the end state.' 'We’re working through a spectrum of options that are the minimum invasive opportunities, as well as something that’s more organically equipped, where there’s not even a tablet,' Clark added. 'We started with [the Air Force’s] Air Combat Command with tablets… There was this idea that they wanted to have this discreet control,' Michael Atwood, Vice President of Advanced Programs for General Atomics, had previously said during an appearance on The Merge podcast in 2024. 'I got to fly in one of these jets with a tablet. And it was really hard to fly the airplane, let alone the weapon system of my primary airplane, and spatially and temporally think about this other thing.' The F-35 notably has the benefit here of already having an advanced wide-area digital touchscreen display in its cockpit. The Technology Refresh-3 (TR-3) configuration for the jets, which provides the software and hardware backbones to support the forthcoming Block 4 upgrades, also includes an enhanced panoramic cockpit display. Collins Aerospace, a division of Raytheon (now formally known as RTX), put out a glitzy computer-generated video last year, seen below, that offered a vision for how pilots might control CCA-like drones in the future. This included the F-35's in-cockpit display being used for this purpose. The issuing of commands via tablet-like devices was also depicted. A screen capture from the Collins Aerospace video showing the F-35's in-cockpit display being used to issue commands to nearby drones. Collins Aerospace capture In addition, there are still many questions about the secure communications architectures that will be needed to support operations involving CCAs and similar drones, as well as for F-35s and F-22s to operate effectively in the airborne controller role. The F-35 could use the popular omnidirectional Link 16 network for this purpose, but doing so would make it easier for opponents to detect the fighter jet and the drone. The F-22, which has long only had the ability to transmit and not receive data via Link 16, faces similar issues. Both the Joint Strike Fighter and the Raptor have specialized directional low probability of intercept/low probability of detection (LPI/LPD) datalinks, the Multifunctional Advanced Data Link (MADL) and Intra-Flight Data Link (IFDL), respectively. However, MADL cannot 'talk' to IFDL, or vice versa, and neither one can communicate directly with other links. Lockheed Martin and the U.S. military have been actively working on ways to 'translate' between MADL and IFDL, as well as between those links and others, including via communications gateway nodes on other crewed and uncrewed aircraft, in recent years. Regardless, equipping the drones themselves with MADL or IFDL could allow for direct highly-secure, jam resistant command links. We have seen the XQ-58 equipped with MADL, for instance, during tests. Using drones as translators and rebroadcasting nodes could work as well. A briefing slide discussing some of the general capabilities of IFDL and MADL. DARPA Regardless, Lockheed Martin's centering of the F-35 (and the F-22 to a lesser degree) in this discussion is also interesting given the significant uncertainty around plans for a new crewed sixth-generation stealth combat jet as part of the Air Force's larger Next-Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative. NGAD also includes the CCA program. Acting as an airborne drone controller has long been envisioned as a key role for the NGAD combat jet effort, which was originally crafted as a replacement for the F-22 and was subjected to a deep review last year. Various alternatives have been evaluated, including a significantly pared-back concept described as more of an F-35 follow-on that is focused primarily on the drone control mission. The Air Force has also separately backed off on any timeline for retiring the F-22, which continues to receive significant new upgrades. President Donald Trump's administration now has the task of deciding how to proceed, or not, with the NGAD combat jet amid broader serious concerns about the affordability of various top-priority Air Force programs, including the CCA program and plans for future stealth tankers. The service has previously said that the ballooning cost of the Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile program, specifically, was a key factor in the decision to review the NGAD combat jet effort. A rendering of a notional sixth-generation combat jet flying with a trio of drones. Collins Aerospace Expanding the ability of the F-35, specifically, to serve in the drone controller role has potential ramifications beyond the Air Force's CCA program. The Air Force and the Navy have already been working together on systems that will allow for the seamless exchange of control of CCAs and other drones belonging to either service during future operations. The U.S. Marine Corps, which is pursuing its own loyal wingman-type drones currently through experimentation with Kratos XQ-58 Valkyries, also has formal ties to the Air Force's CCA program. All three services fly variants of the Joint Strike Fighter. It's also worth noting here that the U.S. military has been publicly demonstrating the ability of tactical jets to actively control drones in mid-air for nearly a decade now, at least. In 2015, a U.S. Marine Corps AV-8B Harrier jump jet flew notably together with a Kratos Unmanned Tactical Aerial Platform-22 (UTAP-22) drone in testing that included 'command and control through the tactical data link.' Other experimentation is known to have occurred across the U.S. military since then, and this doesn't account for additional work in the classified domain. U.S. allies and partners, a growing number of which are also F-35 operators, may be included in CCA's Increment 2 phase. Many of them have similar drone developments already underway that will require advanced control architectures, too. Commonality in control architectures could have operational benefits, especially during future coalition operations, as well as help accelerate development and spread out cost burdens. Explicit cooperation and collaboration between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia on uncrewed capabilities, including autonomous technologies and related developments, is a notable element of the trilateral AUKUS security partnership. 'Work continues with urgency in 2025, with a particular focus on further integrating drones with the F-22 and F-35 in real-world flight tests to enable rapid testing and learning that can be put into action in the near term,' Lockheed Martin's press release from yesterday adds. 'These capabilities ensure America and its allies stay ahead of ready, equipped with flexible, scalable technologies that rapidly adapt to the evolving demands of future defense operations, securing America’s dominance of the skies.' The F-35, in particular, looks on track to become a particularly important crewed companion for Air Force CCAs, as well as other advanced drones, in the coming years.

Chinese Navy Commissions First Type 054B Frigate	China’s first Type 054B frigate, the Luohe, was commissioned into the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) on Wednesday. The PLAN's newest warship is purportedly bristling with advanced features. Its commissioning follows a Pentagon warning late last year about Beijing’s growing ability to quickly churn out high-end vessels as part of a rapidly expanding fleet with increasing reach across the globe. The ship class, referred to by the U.S. and NATO as the Jiangkai III class, could eventually become the backbone of China’s combat fleet in the future, although Luohe and a second Type 054B are believed to be the only two built thus far. The Luohe was commissioned at the Qingdao Comprehensive Support Base, situated just across the Yellow Sea from South Korea. The ship was launched in 2023 and underwent sea trials last year. While Beijing released few technical details on the vessel, online posts citing the government state that the ship displaces about 5,000 tons. It is also believed to be longer and more capable of future system upgrades than its predecessor, the Type 054A. China's first Type 054B frigate, the Luohe. (X.com) The Type 054B also suggests a stealthier design, with its clean superstructure and overall shaping helping to reduce its radar cross section. In that respect, the warship is similar to the French Aquitaine class frigate, which adopted similar signature-reduction aspects, among many others that have or are adopting similar design traits around the globe to enhance survivability.

Images released online reveal some aspects of Beijing's latest warship, but not necessarily the entirety of Type 054B's innovation. While Luohe and the ships that will follow in the class bear similarities to China's older 054A frigate, this latest frigate is a design that appears to be focused on further reducing reliance on legacy Russian-derived equipment, instead focusing on all indigenous systems, the Australia-based Luck said. While some unknowns exist regarding the Luohe, Luck noted that the sensor array seen in images is entirely new compared to Type 054A. That sensor fit includes a two-sided, rotating electronically scanned array (AESA) primary radar atop the main mast and what appears to be an electronic warfare system extending out of either side of the secondary mast's midpoint. The main and secondary masts of the Chinese Type 054B frigate Luohe. (X.com) 'The ship seems to do away with the dedicated illumination radars for [HQ-16 medium-range surface-to-air missile] guidance, but it's not clear how integration has changed exactly in this regard,' he said. 'It's possible the design uses an improved HQ-16 missile to go with the new sensors, but that's speculative too. Either way, in sensor fit, the ship notably moves away from the Russian tech base used to develop hardware such as the Type 382 and 366 radars and the MR-90 illuminators fitted to Type 054A.' Among other changes between the Luohe and its Type 054A predecessors, the new frigate is fitted with what appears to be an improved version of the H/PJ-87 100mm gun as its main deck gun. Previously, Chinese frigates sported the 76mm as standard fit, although two Type 054 frigates did at one point sport 100mm guns, Luck said. The main gun on China's Type 056B frigate. (X.com) Behind that gun and just in front of the superstructure there is a Type 1130 close-in defense weapon system with an 11-barrel Gatling-type rotary barrel cannon.

(X.com) It also has dual quad box-like missile launchers amidships that fire YJ-83 anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs), Luck said. The propulsion system features two diesel engines, but Luck noted that he originally expected the Type 054B class to feature a gas turbine. Quad launchers aboard China's first Type 054B frigate, the Luohe. (X.com) The frigate boasts a larger hangar than the Type 054A, and can host the Z-20F, a multirole maritime helicopter that mirrors the U.S. Navy’s SH-60 Seahawk. The Z-20 would provide a critical piece to the Type 045B’s anti-submarine warfare (ASW) capabilities, but could also undertake other missions, likely including anti-surface warfare. The latest batch of Type 054As can also accommodate the Z-20, Luck said, 'so this may support the idea that PLAN keeps relying on the 054A for shorter term requirements while they test and improve the Type 054B.'

More advanced types are also in the works as China pushes ahead with unmanned aircraft technologies on all fronts. Luck said the PLAN doesn't appear intent on embarking on a Type 054B building spree just yet, and has noted in his writing how the Luohe and a second frigate are the only ships in the class to be built thus far. 'I think 054B mostly fits the established approach of PLAN when it comes to inducting new combatant designs,' he told TWZ. 'Which means they are quite cautious, initially building a small number to figure out a new design and then either confirm the configuration for mass production or make some changes before they do so. The only notable aberration in that regard was [the Type 055 destroyer], which the builders immediately laid down in numbers.' While the Luohe bears some similarities to the Type 054A, which numbers more than 40 ships of different variants first entering service in 2008, Luck said the new frigate is 'a far more modern design,' and he suspects its true innovations may be lurking belowdecks. The Chinese Type 054A frigate Yiyang departs Naval Station Mayport, Florida, in 2015 following a scheduled multi-day goodwill port visit. (Paul Hennessy/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) 'Some of the most interesting things about an efficient and modern naval combatant are not very visible from the outside, such as how its command-and-control work, how crew spaces are reconfigured to improve performance including with a possibly smaller crew and so on,' he said. 'I think a few significant changes are on the inside and we have to see more imagery of the ships in service to figure some of these out.' Another big question is cost. If this ship can offer relatively robust capabilities at low cost and build times, it could really help the PLAN's massive fleet expansion initiative. Luohe's debut comes as the U.S. Navy stumbles through its own Constellation class frigate acquisition program, which is at least three years behind schedule. Despite being based on an existing Fregata Europa Multi-Missione (FREMM) parent design, the future warship is suffering 'unplanned weight growth' that could lead to a loss of speed. While the Constellation began having about 85 percent commonality with the parent design, that has plunged roughly 15 percent following Navy design changes, USNI News' Mallory Shelbourne reported in May. While much about the Type 054B is still to be learned, the class is yet another factor in what the U.S. Navy has identified as a huge disparity between Chinese and U.S. capacity to build new naval vessels and total naval force sizes. As The War Zone previously reported, the Office of Naval Intelligence believes Chinese shipbuilders are more than 200 times more capable of producing surface warships and submarines. An Office of Naval Intelligence slide depicting the force laydown for the U.S. and Chinese navies. (U.S. Navy) By most recent estimates, China’s fleet numbers more than 370 vessels, while the U.S. Navy battle force sits at less than 300. This disparity only looks set to grow as China continues its shipbuilding campaign with a huge shipyard capacity advantage over the U.S., and as the U.S. Navy continues to fumble its future shipbuilding agenda against many competing fiscal priorities.

This Is South Korea’s New Heavily Armed Marine Attack Helicopter	South Korea’s locally developed Marine Attack Helicopter (MAH) recently made its first flight and a video now provides us with a much better look at its extensive modifications. With its heavy load of armament carried on relatively huge stub wings, the MAH also stands out for its striking resemblance to the modified Aérospatiale Puma that played the role of the Soviet Mi-24 Hind gunship in the Rambo movie franchise of the 1980s, and that’s not entirely coincidental. 'MAH' takes off for the first time.MAH is a new, dedicated attack helicopter designed for the South Korean Marine Corp.20mm triple barreled chain gun, Taipers missiles, France Mistral, proven platform, latest avionics..that sounds promising.I should call this Korean Hind.It… pic.twitter.com/JPCxDPjJqp&mdash; ハク Mason (@mason_8718) January 22, 2025 The first flight of the Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) MAH was announced last week by the Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA), which manages South Korean defense procurement. However, the milestone event occurred back on December 17, the manufacturer confirmed. KAI added that the first flight lasted around 20 minutes and involved tests of the helicopter’s flight control performance and stability. This included 'taxiing, taking off, and performing hovering, circling, forward/backward/left/right flights, S-shaped circling flights, and maximum horizontal flight at an altitude of approximately 30 meters [100 feet],' KAI said. The prototype MAH. via X (screencap) The most striking features of the MAH relate to its extensive armament, tailored for its missions of amphibious assault, close air support, and coastal defense. A 20mm three-barrel gun is mounted in a turret below the nose (since this is a prototype, the nose also sports a prominent orange-painted boom for test instrumentation). Attached to the sides of the fuselage are stub wings with three weapons hardpoints on each. In the video of the prototype helicopter, these carry — from inboard out — a pair of tube-launched anti-tank guided missiles, a seven-round pod for unguided rockets, and a pair of containerized air-to-air missiles (AAMs). Meanwhile, an electro-optical/infrared turret is fitted at the front of the nose. Stub-wing weapons and missile/laser warning sensors on the prototype MAH. via X (screencap) Previous reports suggest that the missiles carried are Cheongeom ATGMs (up to eight of which can be carried, in four-round clusters), which are locally produced by Hanwha Aerospace, and MBDA Mistral AAMs. However, DAPA has in the past said that it expects the MAH to be armed with locally made AAMs, which would be 'the first time that a domestically developed helicopter has an air-to-air missile capability.' It’s unclear if these plans have now been superseded by integrating the tried-and-tested Mistral, which is also found in the other helicopter-launched applications, as seen in the video below. At least some of the weapons systems on the MAH have already been integrated on the Light Armed Helicopter (LAH-1) Miron, another locally developed rotorcraft, but based on the Airbus H155. The Miron was developed for the Republic of Korea Army (ROKA) and the first examples were delivered to that service late last month.

Photo by JUNG YEON-JE/AFP via Getty Images JUNG YEON-JE Less obvious are other adaptations for the MAH’s combat role, including its extensive self-protection suite, which includes missile warning sensors on the sides of the nose, and laser warning sensors on the sides of the cockpit. On the flight deck, the crew of the MAH is provided with a fully integrated glass cockpit, which includes target acquisition and designation sights (TADS), a stores management computer, helmet-mounted displays, and night-vision goggles capability. Power for the MAH is provided by a pair of General Electric/Hanwha Aerospace T700-701K turboshaft engines each developing 1,855 shaft horsepower, with full-authority digital engine (FADEC) to optimize performance. Published dimensions of the MAH. Korea Aerospace Industries Befitting its maritime role, the MAH is extensively protected against seawater corrosion, is outfitted with flotation devices for emergency landings on water, and has folding main rotor blades to reduce its deck ‘footprint.’ Overall, the up-armed MAH does look reminiscent of the modified Puma that was used in at least two of the Rambo movies, playing the role of the Soviet Mi-24. In fact, that shouldn’t be entirely surprising, as some of the design DNA from the Puma was fed into the South Korean helicopter program early on in its development. The up-armed Puma that was used in Rambo: First Blood Part II, released in 1988. YouTube screencap The MAH is the latest expression of the Korean Utility Helicopter (KUH) program, which was launched back in 2006 as a joint venture involving KAI, Eurocopter (now Airbus), DAPA, and the Korean Aerospace Research Institute. The involvement of Eurocopter saw the KUH take as its conceptual starting point the AS532 Cougar — an evolution of the earlier Puma design. The first helicopter to emerge from this effort was the Surion, which was rolled out in July 2009 and made its first flight in March 2010. The KUH-1 Surion prototype. Korea Aerospace Industries This became Korea’s first domestically designed and produced helicopter, with the KUH-1 Surion being ordered by the Republic of Korea Army (ROKA), primarily to replace its fleet of UH-1H Huey helicopters used for troop lift, search and rescue, and liaison. The KUH-1 entered service in 2012 and also led to a dedicated medical evacuation version, the KUH-1M, with medical equipment, a weather radar, an external winch, and auxiliary fuel tanks.

Flyblackarrow/Wikimedia Commons The KUH-1 was followed by the MUH-1 Marineon for the Republic of Korea Marine Corps (ROKMC), and the KUH-1CG variant for the Korean Coast Guard, while further civil versions have been produced for the National Emergency Management Agency, the Korea Forest Service, and the National Police Agency. The helicopter has also been offered for export, so far without winning any orders. In October 2022, DAPA awarded KAI a $300-million contract to develop the MAH, as an armed version of the MUH-1 Marineon. By the end of last year, KAI had completed production of the first three MAH prototypes and the first ground tests of a prototype began in October 2024. DAPA has said that it expects 2025 to see the MAH undergo full-scale test and evaluation, including many more flight tests, with development planned to be completed in the second half of 2026. Once in service, the MAH will be able to provide powerful fire support and escort for ROKMC Marineon helicopters, including during amphibious assault operations. A rendering showing MAH and MUH-1 helicopters supporting an amphibious assault. Korea Aerospace Industries The ROKMC has only recently begun to re-emerge as an aviation operator within the South Korean military. Although the ROKMC operated light fixed-wing aircraft back in the 1950s, the service was disbanded and its assets were integrated into the ROK Navy (ROKN) in 1973. In 1987, the ROKMC was reestablished but it would not be until 2014 that it was permitted to establish an aviation component. At this point, it was planned to introduce 40 helicopters within three squadrons: two equipped with assault helicopters and one with attack helicopters. To furnish the assault squadrons, 30 MUH-1 Marineon helicopters were ordered, suggesting that the service would eventually get (at least) 10 MAH for its attack squadron. Since then, however, Seoul has placed orders for 24 of the MAH version. A rendering showing MAH helicopters on the deck of an amphibious assault ship. Korea Aerospace Industries The introduction of the MUH-1 Marineon was not entirely smooth. The first two examples were officially inducted by the ROKMC in January 2018, but one of these crashed in July of the same year, after a rotor blade sheared off followed by the detachment of the entire rotor head. This led to a grounding of the entire Surion fleet during which cracks were discovered in the rotor masts of other examples. A thorough inspection was made of all the rotor masts and ROKA KUH-1s had returned to limited flying operations before the end of 2018.

As well as adding new helicopters to the ROKMC, South Korea is generally investing more in amphibious warfare as part of a broader expansion of its naval power, which also includes new submarines and heavily armed surface combatants, all part of a more hawkish approach toward North Korea. The two Dokdo class assault ships are the most powerful expressions of these growing amphibious capabilities and will be very suitable hosts for the MAH helicopters once these enter service. Although optimized for attack missions, the MAH also looks to retain its cabin, suggesting that it can also transport troops when required, much like the Mi-24 series. The Marineon can carry up to 11 troops and, even if some of the internal space is lost in the new version, this should ensure the MAH remains a very versatile platform. Next up, the ROK Navy could be set to receive a mine countermeasures version of the Marineon, reflecting the need to defeat North Korea’s extensive mine warfare program. Work on the mine countermeasures Marineon is expected to be completed before the end of 2026. With this in mind, the extensive development path of the South Korean helicopter looks set to continue.

Royal Navy Nuclear Submarine Surfaced Next To Russian Spy Ship To...	The United Kingdom has confirmed that one of its Royal Navy nuclear-powered submarines surfaced close to the Yantar, a notorious Russian spy ship late last year, to make it clear it was being observed. The revelation came as the Royal Navy was once again closely tracking the Russian ship after it returned to British waters. According to the U.K. defense secretary, the Yantar has, in recent months, been 'mapping the U.K.’s critical underwater infrastructure,' at a time when NATO, in general, is increasingly concerned about apparent sabotage to undersea cables. The Yantar was sailing in British waters in November last year, during which time U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey said it had been 'detected loitering over U.K. critical undersea infrastructure.' The Yantar transits through the English Channel during an earlier visit to these waters, in 2018. Crown Copyright LPhot Dan Rosenbaum Interestingly, Healey disclosed that a Royal Navy submarine was among the assets tasked with shadowing the Yantar when it was in British waters back in November. The defense secretary said that warships and patrol aircraft were also involved in tracking the Russian vessel. At one point, the submarine surfaced close to the Yantar 'to make clear that we had been covertly monitoring its every move,' he said. The submarine wasn’t named but will have been one of the five currently active Astute class attack submarines. A Royal Navy Astute class nuclear-powered attack submarine. Crown Copyright www.twz.com The Russian vessel then moved into Irish waters east of Dublin, sparking worries that it might be conducting espionage on critical energy and internet submarine pipelines and cables running between the United Kingdom and Ireland. The spy ship was later escorted out of the Irish Sea. It’s rare for the U.K. government to release any kind of information about the activities of its nuclear-powered submarine fleet, especially regarding such sensitive surveillance missions. In this case, the information was likely made public to dissuade Russia from further espionage directed against critical underwater infrastructure. The tactic may have been effective anyway, with Healey saying that, during its latest venture into British waters, this week, the Yantar didn’t remain on station for any longer period and was closely escorted throughout its journey by the Type 23 frigate HMS Somerset and the River class offshore patrol vessel HMS Tyne. A library image shows three River class patrol vessels, led by HMS Tyne (foreground) exercising off the coast of Cornwall, England. Crown Copyright LA(Phot) Al Macleod According to the Royal Navy, Somerset 'covertly launched her Merlin helicopter, which used its powerful sensors to locate the Russian ship as it made its way north towards the English Channel.' The Type 23 frigate then closed in on the Yantar’s location and intercepted it at the entrance to the Channel, off the French coast. 'Somerset used her cutting-edge radars and sensors to report on every move during the operation, as she maintained a close distance to Yantar through the Channel and the Strait of Dover,' the Navy added. HMS Somerset (foreground) tracks the movements of a Russian spy ship Yantar this week, in waters close to the United Kingdom. Crown Copyright Crown Copyright Tracking the Yantar is not necessarily a difficult job, since its position is typically broadcast at regular intervals using the automatic identification system (AIS), an automatic tracking system that uses transceivers on ships. This data is then also published by online ship tracking services.

HMS Somerset shadows the Russian spy ship Yantar in the English Channel this week. Crown Copyright Royal Navy Healey went on to accuse Russia of threatening European security by targeting undersea infrastructure carrying oil, gas, electricity, and the internet. 'We see you. We know what you’re doing,' he told members of parliament. Healey added that the Yantar was first picked up on Monday when it was 45 miles off the British coast, inside the U.K.’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ).

Officially, the Yantar is a Project 22010 'oceanographic research vessel,' but it has specialized equipment that can reportedly tap or cut submarine cables and investigate and retrieve objects from depths of up to 18,000 feet. It is part of the Russian Defense Ministry fleet, being operated by the Main Directorate Deep-Sea Research, which works on behalf of the Russian Navy, and other agencies. The Yantar was involved in a high-profile operation in 2017 when it sailed off the coast of Syria to recover the wreckage of two fighter jets, a Su-33, and a MiG-29KR, that crashed into the Mediterranean Sea during operations from Russia’s aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov. The following year, 2018, the U.K. Royal Navy again escorted the Yantar through the English Channel as it headed into the North Sea. At this time, it was carrying a Saab SeaEye Tiger deep-sea robot on its deck. Russia acquired this underwater drone after the Kursk submarine disaster. It can reach depths of 3,280 feet. On this occasion, the U.K. Royal Navy sent the Type 45 destroyer HMS Diamond plus a Wildcat helicopter to follow the Russian ship.

Crown Copyright More recently, the Yantar was reported in the Mediterranean, where it was assumed to be involved in searching and potentially salvaging the wreck of the Russian cargo vessel MV Ursa Major, which sank after an apparent explosion in its engine room in late December.

In the Baltic Sea alone, cables have been damaged on three times occasions, with all of them carrying at least some of the hallmarks of sabotage. In the most prominent event, on December 25, an oil tanker dragging its anchor, damaging a power cable running between Finland and Estonia. This led to NATO launching Baltic Sentry, a mission intended to ensure the security of critical undersea infrastructure in the region. As you can read about here, the mission now also involves Dutch F-35A stealth fighters and it will soon add at least 20 uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) in the coming weeks. This is in addition to surface vessels and maritime patrol aircraft. Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) F-35s flying over the Dutch frigate HNLMS Tromp during the Baltic Sentry mission earlier this week. Dutch Ministry of Defense The vessel responsible for the incident in the Baltic in December was the Eagle S, registered in the Cook Islands, but connected with Russia. The oil tanker was also revealed to be brimming with spy equipment after it was seized by authorities. The suggestion that this incident was connected somehow to the Kremlin was also raised by Healey, who noted that 'many analysts believe this was caused by a vessel in Russia’s shadow fleet.' The potential risk to undersea infrastructure has long been understood, especially bearing in mind how hard it can be to defend it against nefarious action — and the degree to which nations rely on it to fulfill many of their critical needs. 'We are now seeing Russian underwater activity in the vicinity of undersea cables that I don’t believe we have ever seen,' U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Andrew Lennon, then serving as NATO’s top submarine officer, told The Washington Post back in December 2017. 'Russia is clearly taking an interest in NATO and NATO nations’ undersea infrastructure.' Meanwhile, there is now a wide acknowledgment that the Russian war in Ukraine — and the heightened East-West tensions as a result — are driving up the scale of this risk. With that in mind, spy ships like the Yantar are sure to be closely tracked by NATO assets whenever they are found operating in their waters.
