Bunker Talk: Let’s Talk About All The Things We Did And Didn’t Co...	Welcome to Bunker Talk. This is a weekend open discussion post for the best commenting crew on the net, in which we can chat about all the stuff that went on this week that we didn’t cover. We can also talk about the stuff we did or whatever else grabs your interest. In other words, it’s an off-topic thread. The caption to this week’s top shot reads: NANTWICH, ENGLAND - MAY 24: The British Telecom telephone exchange inside the former RAF Hack Green secret nuclear bunker on May 24, 2023 in Nantwich, England. Hack Green played a central role in the defence of Britain for almost sixty years. It was chosen during WW2 to protect the land between Birmingham and Liverpool from hostile attack and as a location for the new RADAR equipment. The bunker went on to be used for shelter and protection during the Cold War. As relations between East and West thawed many of the UK's nuclear bunkers were sold off. The Secret Bunker is now privately owned by the Siebert family and is run as a museum trust. (Photo by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images) Also, a reminder: Prime Directives! If you want to talk politics, do so respectfully and know that there’s always somebody that isn’t going to agree with you. If you have political differences, hash it out respectfully, stick to the facts, and no childish name-calling or personal attacks of any kind. If you can’t handle yourself in that manner, then please, discuss virtually anything else. No drive-by garbage political memes. No conspiracy theory rants. Links to crackpot sites will be axed, too. Trolling and shitposting will not be tolerated. No obsessive behavior about other users. Just don’t interact with folks you don’t like. Do not be a sucker and feed trolls! That’s as much on you as on them. Use the mute button if you don’t like what you see. So unless you have something of quality to say, know how to treat people with respect, understand that everyone isn’t going to subscribe to your exact same worldview, and have come to terms with the reality that there is no perfect solution when it comes to moderation of a community like this, it’s probably best to just move on. Finally, as always, report offenders, please. This doesn’t mean reporting people who don’t share your political views, but we really need your help in this regard. The Bunker is open!

Hole Blasted By Drone In Chernobyl’s Radiation Shield: What We Kn...	Top Ukrainian nuclear experts tell The War Zone that they are concerned about the future effects of a drone strike on the radiation shield covering the doomed Reactor 4 at the decommissioned Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. While the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said there was no immediate radiation release, the massive, complexly designed New Safe Containment (NSC) structure was compromised and could suffer further damage, the experts told us. In addition, one expert expressed concern that in a worst-case scenario, the ensuing repair work could require the entire containment structure to be rolled back on tracks, exposing the destroyed inner core that the NSC was designed to encapsulate. This infographic shows the location of the drone strike on the New Safety Containment structure at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant. (Photo by Murat Usubali/Anadolu via Getty Images) Anadolu The concerns were raised after a drone struck the NSC overnight, causing a fire and breach of the NSC roof's outer layer, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi stated. While the outer layer sustained damage, investigations are ongoing to determine the status of the inner layer of that roof. Video and images emerging in the aftermath show a fire, as well as remains of the drone that fell into the facility. Emergency personnel on top of the NSC were also seen assessing the damage. Ukraine says this was a deliberate attack while the Russians say they did not strike the facility. Because the structure is so tall, the possibility exists that this could have been accidental.

We must hold Russia accountable, not appease it. pic.twitter.com/QBlSdctK6y&mdash; Maria Avdeeva (@maria_avdv) February 14, 2025 The nearly 2,000-ton NSC is a huge arch structure. Standing 360 feet tall, 213 feet long, and 850 feet wide, it was built to slide over the remains of the reactor that melted down in 1986. In the wake of that disaster, workers built a 21-story tall 'sarcophagus' to cover Reactor 4. However, it left many gaps and was not secured to the underlying structure, which could still collapse. That left the enclosure vulnerable to leaking rainwater, settling, earthquakes, as well as aircraft and projectiles. To mitigate these problems, the NSC was built at the cost of nearly $2 billion and pushed via railroad-like tracks over the sarcophagus in 2016. While designed to withstand an earthquake, tornadoes and even small aircraft strikes, the NSC was not built to protect against an explosive drone, the experts told us.

Another big concern is that explosive shock waves from the strike could have caused damage far beyond the hole it punched in what was a virtually hermetically sealed container, the commander of the radiation surveillance platoon in the Chernobyl Zone during the first months after the 1986 explosion told us. The NSC is a complex, integrated system with many components and the section that was struck is just one part of that, explained Mirnyi, now a research fellow at the National Chernobyl Museum in Kyiv. 'The main problem is not the opening itself, but rather what will happen to the other components and the system as a whole,' Miryni explained. There are two layers to the roof. The drone punched through the first layer and officials are assessing the integrity of the second. However, the strike damaged rails attached to it designed to move cranes that eventually will take apart the remains of Reactor 4, Olena Pareniuk, a senior researcher for Ukraine’s Institute for Safety Problems of Nuclear Power Plants (ISSNP), told us. ISSNP oversees operations at the NSC. The damage will delay testing on the crane system, Pareniuk stated. 'That’s a big deal,' she exclaimed, adding that an assessment is now underway to determine the extent of the damage. Inside the New Safe Confinement Arch, December 2016 (chnpp.gov.ua/) The worst-case scenario is that future repair work will require the NSC to be rolled back on the tracks, exposing the sarcophagus. 'That is an unstable structure,' she said of the sarcophagus. 'Of course, it would be dangerous if we had to do this.' That would risk the release of radioactive material and be 'crazy expensive,' she said. Mirnyi estimated that the repair work could cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Pareniuk stressed that it was very early in the process and much more will come to light in the coming days and weeks. This is the latest in a series of incidents affecting nuclear power plants in the Ukrainian war zone. There were concerns raised when the Russians first occupied Chernobyl in the early days of the war that radioactive dirt could be kicked up by their presence and the facility itself could be struck by a weapon. Just weeks later, combat at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), Europe’s largest, sparked global concerns after a training facility on the site was struck by a projectile. The Russians later occupied ZNPP and built defensive fortifications on it as both sides traded accusations about attacks there. You can see the fighting that took place at the ZNPP in the following video.

We will know more about the exact extent of the damage and the cost to repair it in the coming days and weeks.

America’s First Broken Arrow Incident Happened 75 Years Ago	The United States lost its first nuclear weapon exactly 75 years ago when a Convair B-36 Peacemaker jettisoned a single freefall nuclear bomb before crashing in northwestern British Columbia, Canada. This was the first of at least 32 known U.S. nuclear weapon accidents, of the kind known as Broken Arrows, which are defined as the accidental launching, firing, detonating, theft, or loss of a weapon. None of these have occurred since the Cold War, but their legacy remains a stark reminder of the enormously high stakes faced by atomic warfighters in all their forms. Just before midnight on February 13, 1950, a B-36B from Strategic Air Command’s 7th Bombardment Wing-Heavy, opened its bomb bay doors at around 8,000 feet, around 55 miles northwest of Bella Bella, on the north coast of British Columbia. A single Mk 4 nuclear bomb plummeted into the Pacific Ocean; there was a bright flash on impact, followed by a sound and shockwave. B-36s over Illinois on July 4, 1949. The aircraft are very likely B-36Bs from the 7th Bombardment Wing at Carswell Air Force Base. U.S. Air Force The detonation was caused by the bomb’s high-explosive material, with the fissile core having been removed and replaced with a lead practice core of the same weight. Otherwise, with a yield of up to 31 kilotons, it would have had roughly twice the destructive power of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Led by pilot Capt. Harold Barry, the crew of the B-36 took the decision to drop the unarmed bomb after encountering serious mechanical problems in the course of a training mission. This had involved a simulated combat profile flown between Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska and Carswell Air Force Base in Texas (the latter was the home station of the 7th Bombardment Wing, Heavy). The simulated target would have been San Francisco, standing in for a Soviet or Chinese city of comparable size. The aircraft commander of a B-36 of the 11th Bombardment Wing, Heavy, prepares to fly a practice mission from Carswell Air Force Base in Texas. U.S. Air Force At the time, the B-36 was very much the cutting-edge of Strategic Air Command — the first truly intercontinental U.S. bomber, the airframe involved in the incident was also very new, with only 186 hours of flying before its loss. Soon after taking off, the bomber had run into trouble. After entering bad weather, ice began to form on the exterior of the aircraft. In an effort to maintain the required altitude, the crew powered up the engines. Around six hours into the training mission and at an altitude of around 12,000 feet, three of the engines caught fire and had to be shut down. The bomber was now flying on its remaining three Pratt & Whitney Wasp Major radial engines — the B-model was yet to receive the four additional J47 turbojet engines, two each in two underwing pods, which appeared on later Peacemakers and gave a much-needed performance boost. A B-36 on deployment at RAF Lakenheath, England, in January 1951. This example has the underwing pods with additional jet engines. Photo by Mirrorpix via Getty Images Mirrorpix Despite the emergency power settings on the three engines, the aircraft was now losing altitude. When it became apparent that level flight could no longer be maintained, the decision was made to abandon the aircraft. First, and following Air Force protocol of the time, the Mk 4 nuclear bomb had to be jettisoned, its fuze having been set to detonate at around 4,600 feet — once again, there was no nuclear material in the weapon. At this time, U.S. freefall bombs were designed to have their fissile cores inserted during flight, a safeguard that was deemed necessary for these first-generation strategic weapons. Only with a Presidential decision would a bomber take off with the fissile core onboard. A Mk IV nuclear bomb. This was essentially an improved and mass-produced version of the Fat Man weapon that was dropped on Nagasaki. Public Domain Barry later told an Air Force board of inquiry, in a testimony later published by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists: 'We were losing altitude quite rapidly in excess of 500 feet a minute, and I asked the radar operator to give me a heading to take me out over water. We kept our rapid rate of descent, and we got out over the water just about 9,000 feet, and the copilot hit the salvo switch, and at first, nothing happened, so he hit it again and this time it opened. The radar operator gave me a heading to take me back over land, the engineer gave me emergency power to try to hold our altitude. We still descended quite rapidly, and by the time we got over land, we were at 5,000 feet. So, I rang the alarm bell and told them to leave.' Capt. Barry then set the aircraft’s course to fly southwest for an ocean crash. The 17-man crew bailed out over Princess Royal Island. The crew of a Strategic Air Command B-36. In this case, the variant is an RB-36 from the 72nd Strategic Reconnaissance Wing. U.S Air Force There was a huge rescue effort to try and recover the crew and sensitive equipment from the aircraft. In all, more than 40 U.S. and Canadian aircraft were involved. A search southwest of the bailout point found no sign of the bomber, which was, at this point, thought to have come down in the sea. Of the crew, five were never recovered. It’s presumed they came down in the water between Gil and Princess Royal islands. In freezing conditions, and without exposure suits, they wouldn’t have survived long; furthermore, not all the crew had inflatable life jackets. As for the B-36, the wreckage was eventually found in 1953, on the side of Mount Kologet on Vancouver Island, around 220 miles north of where the crew had bailed out. The bomber had been uncovered during a separate Royal Canadian Air Force search for a missing oil prospector. The approximate location of the crash site, and other key locations in the incident, including Eielson Air Force Base, from where the B-36 took off. Google Earth With concerns that sensitive equipment from the bomber might find its way into the Soviets’ hands, the U.S. Air Force sent a recovery team, but they were initially unable to access the mountainous crash site. Two follow-up missions were sent and, finally, in 1954, a small demolition team managed to get to the crash site and secure or destroy classified parts of the bomber. One of the missing crewmembers was the atomic weaponeer, Capt. Theodore Schreier. With no confirmation that he bailed out, this led to some speculation that he may have decided to stay onboard the stricken aircraft. This, in turn, raised questions about whether the bomb had also remained on board, with Schreier attempting to nurse the aircraft back to Alaska. However, all evidence points to the crew having successfully fuzed the bomb to explode, dropping it out of the bomb bay, and watching it detonate above the water. A more recent investigation of the crash site suggests the same, with the bomb shackle showing no evidence that the plane crashed with a weapon onboard. The relatively intact bomb shackle among the wreckage. Diefenbunker: Canada’s Cold War Museum As the site of the first Broken Arrow, the location of the crash has been visited periodically by investigators in the years since the accident. Also, trophy hunters have stripped much of what was left of the bomber for artifacts. Now, with the availability of helicopters, and with less snow on the ground, it has become much easier to reach the crash site. Wreckage from the characteristic B-36 cockpit section. Diefenbunker: Canada’s Cold War Museum During a 2003 visit, an investigation team found the aft crew compartment, the rear bomb bay, and one section of the outer wing, as the only significant intact parts, with the wreckage otherwise mostly consisting of the tiny pieces left after the demolition team did their work. When the B-36 and its nuclear cargo were lost on February 13, 1950, the United States and the Soviet Union were only just embarking on the Cold War and the tense nuclear standoff that would follow for decades beyond. Indeed, at the time of this incident, the United States still enjoyed a huge advantage over its adversary in terms of nuclear capability, with around 235 fully functional atomic bombs, compared to perhaps two in the Soviet Union.

Armstrong Roberts/ClassicStoc As the Soviets matched that gap, and the nuclear stockpiles in East and West continued to grow, the demands of maintaining and operating weapons safely became ever greater. Broken Arrow incidents have led to the confirmed loss of six nuclear weapons that were never recovered, but each incident has also served as a stark learning process, leading to revisions in how U.S. nuclear weapons are stored and operated. In the Canadian context, another Mk 4 nuclear bomb was jettisoned over Quebec later in 1950, after a Strategic Air Command B-50 suffered engine trouble, but subsequently landed safely. In that incident, the high explosive detonated, and around 100 pounds of uranium — used for the bomb’s tamper, the dense metal used to hold the core together, rather than the core itself — were scattered over the nearby area. As for the U.S. Air Force, the service’s nuclear-armed bombers would soon be airborne at all times, in an alert posture known as Operation Chrome Dome, which ran from 1960 to 1968. Several high-profile nuclear accidents, including the accidental release of nuclear weapons on foreign territory, saw Chrome Dome replaced. Crew race to their B-52G at a Strategic Air Command base around 1960. ullstein bild/ullstein bild via Getty Images ullstein bild Dtl. Between 1969 and 1991, the Air Force instead kept B-52 bombers armed with nuclear weapons on alert at all times to try to ensure that they could rapidly get airborne and escape any potential first strike on their operating bases and then be available to retaliate. You can read more about this doctrine in this past War Zone piece. A Broken Arrow event of the kind that happened in February 1950 might seem unthinkable today, but there have been some concerning nuclear incidents, even in more recent years. Notably, in 2007, Air Force personnel mistakenly loaded six AGM-129 Advanced Cruise Missiles, each with a W80-1 variable-yield nuclear warhead, with a maximum yield estimated at 150 kilotons, onto a B-52 at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota. U.S. Air Force personnel load AGM-129s onto a B-52H bomber in 2002. U.S. Air Force The Stratofortress then flew with these weapons on board, unknown to the crew, to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. In the end, the aircraft was armed with live nuclear weapons for a total of 36 hours before personnel uncovered the error and instituted appropriate security and safety precautions at Barksdale. Ultimately, human beings are fallible, as are the systems they have designed to control nuclear weapons. While the Air Force may not have been involved in a Broken Arrow incident since 1980 — and the last one involved an ICBM, rather than a crewed bomber — the potential hazards of the deadly business of nuclear warfighting remain just as relevant today.

Canada Joining Iron Dome Missile Defense Plan Would Be Welcome: N...	U.S. Air Force Gen. Gregory Guillot, the top American military officer overseeing operations in and around North America, has said he would welcome Canadian participation in expanding continental missile defense efforts, including in space. One of President Donald Trump's first official acts of his second term was to order the U.S. military to move forward with plans for a massively enlarged missile defense architecture, dubbed Iron Dome, which notably includes a call for new space-based anti-missile interceptors. Guillot also lauded Canada's efforts to expand its ability to help safeguard North American airspace through new radars and missiles for its existing CF-18 Hornet fighters and planned purchases of stealthy F-35A Joint Strike Fighters. Gen. Guillot, who is head of U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) and the U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), testified on a wide range of issues before the Senate Armed Services Committee yesterday. U.S. Air Force Gen. Gregory Guillot seen an earlier hearing. Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images 'I met recently with the Defense Minister from Canada [Bill Blair]. They are very much interested in participating. They have legal obstacles, but they assume they can jump over them. [They are] very much [interested in] participating in the missile defense system. And their best contribution could come in what way?' Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, asked at one point during the hearing. Canadian Defense Minister Blair publicly said that 'an integrated missile defense system for all of North America is the thing that makes sense to everybody' and expressed interest in partnering in some way on Iron Dome during a call with reporters earlier this month. Canada teaming up with the United States on North American missile defense is something that has also been discussed in the past. Canadian Defense Minister Bill Blair. Thomas Niedermueller/Getty Images Thomas Niedermueller 'I welcome their participation. I think the first [point] would be to buy into our domain awareness expansion, whether ground-based or space-based,' Guillot said in response to Senator Reed's question. 'Then, further down the line, if they get [missile] defeat mechanisms, see how they would mesh with our existing defense mechanisms, defeat mechanisms, in a similar way that we employ fighter aircraft with NORAD. Perhaps we could do the same with missile defeat systems from the ground.' The 'domain awareness expansion' Guillot referred to here are efforts to grow the available sensor architecture, especially in space, to be able to better spot and track incoming threats, as well as provide high-quality targeting data to attempt intercepts. Work to develop and field new space-based sensor systems to tackle advanced hypersonic weapons with very high degrees of maneuverability and that fly along largely flat atmospheric trajectories, which them difficult to track and defend against, has been a particular area of focus for years already. A now-dated infographic that still reflects the U.S. military's current stated plans for a new space-based missile defense-focused sensor architecture, as well as communications networks to support it. DOD At yesterday's hearing, Guillot highlighted existing work on new space-based sensor networks, as well as other efforts to improve 'domain awareness,' as some of the most immediate things that could be leveraged to meet the requirements of the new Iron Dome plan. 'The top priority in that, in our efforts to meet the direction of the [Iron Dome] executive order is first and foremost to establish increased domain awareness. As I mentioned in the opening comments, you can't defeat what you can't see, and the adversaries have an increasing capability of reaching us and threatening us from ranges beyond what some of our current systems can detect and track,' Guillot explained. 'So the first layer of any approach to defending the United States or North America, from the NORAD perspective, would be a sensor layer from seabed to space, systems that can detect threats from a further distance.' 'Those are seabed, ground-based, air-based, such as the E-7 [Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft], and then space-based systems for detecting, tracking, and warning,' he continued. 'Inside of that, I think we build on our existing GBI and NGI capabilities, the Ground-Based Interceptors and Next Generation Interceptors, to defeat intercontinental ballistic missiles.' The U.S. Air Force is in the process of acquiring E-7s to replace its aging E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft. A relatively small number of silo-launched GBIs currently form the core of U.S. military capabilities to actually defeat higher-end ballistic threats, and now increasingly novel hypersonic ones. New NGIs are expected to eventually replace the older GBIs. With the exception of surface-to-air missile systems positioned around Washington, D.C., and the greater National Capital Region (NCR), defense against cruise missiles and other aerial threats falls almost exclusively to fighters. The U.S. Air Force, including the Air National Guard, provides the majority of that capacity for both NORTHCOM and NORAD, something we will come back to later. A graphic offering a very general look at the fields of coverage offered by the current elements of the US military’s missile defense architecture inside the United States and forward-deployed elsewhere around the world. US Army 'Some of those capabilities are right on the edge. Others are probably three to five years out,' the NORTHCOM and NORAD commander added. 'I think within inside of a year, we could have a significant capability that could network those into a single sensing grid.' TWZ has reported extensively on recent U.S. military efforts to develop and field new early warning and intelligence-gathering satellite constellations, in particular. The work looks set to provide American forces with unprecedented persistent surveillance capacity to support strategic missions, such as detecting and tracking incoming threats to the U.S. homeland, as well as more tactical operations. The new constellations will also be distributed in nature with large numbers of smaller satellites, which will help them provide more coverage globally and make them more resistant to enemy attacks. You can read more about these developments in detail here. Beyond satellites, the U.S. military has been working to improve ground-based early warning radar coverage around the U.S. homeland in recent years. The U.S. Navy has also been pursuing new undersea monitoring capabilities with a particular eye toward tracking very quiet and otherwise increasingly more capable Russian and Chinese submarines that present ever-greater threats to the continental United States. Improving the ability of U.S. and Canadian forces to defend the airspace over and around North America more generally has already been a top priority for many years now, as well. The infamous Chinese spy balloon incident in 2023, as well as the downing of three still-unidentified objects in the skies above the United States and Canada that year, put new emphasis on this issue.

Canadian DND via Access to Information Request Via CTV News Drone incursions around U.S. military bases and other critical infrastructure in the United States, as well as facilities that host American forces overseas, including many incidents that TWZ has been the first to report on across years of calling attention to this particular issue, have now become a major factor in these discussions, as well. At the hearing yesterday, Guillot also testified at length about uncrewed aerial threats and efforts to better protect against them, as you can read more about here. As noted earlier, U.S. Air Force fighters currently provide almost all of the more general air defense capacity for North America as a whole. There has been talk about the potential reestablishment of surface-to-air missile sites more broadly within the United States, too. An unclassified map showing NORAD air defense nodes in the contiguous United States circa 2021. Green circles denote bases hosting fighters. DOD The Canadians 'were very collaborative on defining the NORAD requirements and their NORAD modernization is at the very beginning stages. We are seeing improved F-18 radars and missile capabilities already,' Guillot also said in response to a separate question during yesterday's hearing about Canada's commitments to that command. 'The next step we'll see is the arrival of the F-35 in the next two years. So they're well on the track, but we do have some immediate improvements with their F-18s.' Starting in the 2010s, the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) has been upgrading its fleet of aging CF-18A/B+ Hornet fighters. The most notable component of those efforts has been the integration of new AN/APG-79(V)4 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars that greatly improve the ability of those aircraft to spot and track targets, even smaller ones, and do so at extended ranges. The RCAF has also been working to acquire new AIM-120D Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) and AIM-9X Sidewinders to go with those modernized jets. An AMRAAM-armed CF-18. RCAF In 2023, Canadian authorities also finalized plans to buy 88 F-35As, with the first expected to arrive in 2026. The twists and turns that led to that decision were an absolute saga that you can read more about here. Canadian authorities are now in the process of refining requirements for a future national ground-based air defense enterprise, something the country does not currently have, as well. Canadian Defense Minister Blair's comments earlier this month notwithstanding, there is certainly a question about how realistic any major new cooperation with the United States on missile defense matters, or anything else, might be given the current relations between the two countries. Though President Donald Trump's administration paused planned tariffs against Canada, a trade war is still simmering and there are concerns that it could escalate. On top of that, Trump has repeatedly suggested that Canada could be absorbed into the United States, which has drawn serious backlash from the Canadian government, as well as politicians and the general public in that country. TWZ previously explored how this spat might threaten to upend Canada's plans to acquire F-35s. With or without Canadian participation, what parts of the new Iron Dome missile defense plan ultimately come to fruition remain to be seen. The costs alone to develop and field new space-based anti-missile interceptors are expected to be in the tens of billions, if not hundreds of billions of dollars. Canada also has a substantially smaller defense budget currently than the United States, raising additional questions about the degree to which it might be able contribute. Regardless, America's top military officer in charge of operations in and around North America, as well as at least some members of Congress, are clearly in favor of stepping up cooperation with Canada to better protect both countries against incoming ballistic and other missiles.

Trump Offers India Path To F-35	In something of a surprise announcement, President Donald Trump has offered the F-35 stealth fighter to India as he seeks to forge more defense deals and deeper strategic cooperation with New Delhi. The pitch comes at a time when the Indian Air Force is weighing up its options for buying new combat aircraft, with a diverse range of types already under consideration. In the past, the F-35 had widely been seen as a less likely option, based on its sensitive technologies and the fact that India operates significant quantities of advanced Russian defense systems. Trump made the F-35 offer yesterday during the visit of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Washington, DC.

Speaking after Trump at a joint White House news conference, Modi made no mention of the F-35, although a joint media statement referred to a review of U.S. policy on releasing fifth-generation fighters and other high-end systems to India. Even before Trump took office, the United States was increasingly looking to India as a major arms customer. Last year, Indian arms deals worth almost $4 billion were secured by the Biden administration, including 31 MQ-9B Sky Guardian drones, up to 170 AGM-114R Hellfire air-to-ground missiles, and 310 GBU-39B/B Laser Small Diameter Bombs. Separately, India has also agreed to buy six more P-8I Neptune maritime patrol aircraft, as well as Javelin anti-armor missiles and Stryker infantry combat vehicles. India has also struck deals to manufacture the last two items locally. Military personnel inspect a U.S. Air Force F-35A during Aero India 2025, on February 12, 2025. Photo by IDREES MOHAMMED/AFP via Getty Images IDREES MOHAMMED It’s also worth noting that U.S. officials have previously suggested that the F-35 could be offered to India. Most notably, back in 2018, the then-head of U.S. Pacific Command supposedly stated that he supported the sale of the stealth fighter to India. As to how realistic Trump’s F-35 offer is, that remains to be seen, but there’s meanwhile no doubt that India is in the market for new fighters. In a statement provided to TWZ, Lockheed Martin also welcomed the statement: 'We are encouraged by the recent announcement by President Trump to provide the F-35 to India. Lockheed Martin stands ready to support these government-to-government decisions. We look forward to working closely with both governments on upcoming strategic procurements including the fighters, Javelin, and helicopters that will further empower the Indian Armed Forces with 21st-century security solutions and deterrence capabilities to address their pressing needs. This will be a huge step forward in the growing U.S.-India comprehensive strategic partnership.' A U.S. Air Force F-35A performs during Aero India 2025 in Bengaluru on February 12, 2025. Photo by Idrees MOHAMMED / AFP IDREES MOHAMMED Lockheed Martin says it has been 'a trusted and strategic partner to India for over three decades and has been instrumental in establishing the foundation of the aerospace and defense ecosystem. We’ve proven our commitment through various production programs like the C-130J, S-92 cabin, and the fighter wings feeding into the global supply chain.' Most prominent among the Indian Air Force’s fighter requirements is the Multirole Fighter Aircraft (MRFA) competition, seeking 114 new foreign-made jets. So far, candidates for the MRFA competition include the Dassault Rafale, 36 examples of which India previously acquired, under a separate program. When the 114-aircraft requirement was launched it was billed as being specifically for single-engine types, ruling out the French product. Since then, however, the competition appears to be wide open, with the F-15EX, for example, now also being offered, and the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet also in the running. Other European options comprise the Eurofighter Typhoon and the Saab Gripen E/F, while Russia is pitching its Su-57 Felon, which is also appearing at Aero India this week, and which appears to have finally won its first export order. If India decides to procure another single-engine fighter, after all, the Indian-specific F-21 configuration of the F-16 is also a viable candidate. An artist’s impression of the F-21 as offered to India. Lockheed Martin Of course, the F-35 is also a single-engine fighter, but offers an altogether different level of capabilities and high-end technologies than the other options. Reports in the Indian media suggest that a request for proposals for the MRFA competition will be issued this year. As part of Modi’s ‘Make in India’ initiative, the manufacturers vying for MRFA will need to offer local production and technology transfer. In the past, there was a plan to buy a portion of the new fighters off-the-shelf purchases and build the others under license in India — this is something that Russia has offered specifically as part of its Su-57 bid.

Photo by Idrees MOHAMMED / AFP IDREES MOHAMMED Local manufacture of the F-35 might not be an option for India, especially in the near term and it’s by no means clear if New Delhi would drop this requirement. However, the stealth fighter could potentially be offered with other offsets, including component production and the transfer of certain technologies. This could be particularly interesting for India as it embarks on its own next-generation fighter program, the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA), but it would likely still be limited to a significant degree based on India’s close military ties with Russia. Ultimately, the MRFA program seeks to field interim equipment to help address a contracting Indian Air Force combat fleet and to fill the gap before the planned arrival of the AMCA, India’s homegrown fifth-generation fighter. Like other warplanes in this category, the AMCA will feature a low-observable design, including internal weapons bays, new-generation active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, and advanced avionics, and will be intended, from the outset, to operate alongside drones as part of ‘manned-unmanned’ teaming concept.

(Photo by Idrees MOHAMMED / AFP) IDREES MOHAMMED The latest reports indicate that the AMCA is not expected to enter service until 2036, although there remains a question as to whether a potential F-35 deal could come to fruition within this timeframe. Were it to be made possible, the F-35 would offer an off-the-shelf means of drastically enhancing Indian Air Force capabilities at a time when the service is being rapidly outpaced by developments in China. It could even have the potential to completely transform the Indian Air Force and its future fighter procurement plans. On the Indian side, the government would still have to approve funds for what would be a hugely costly investment. 'There is a process by which platforms are acquired,' Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri told reporters in Washington, sounding a word of caution about a potential F-35 deal. Intergovernmental negotiations have not started and the U.S. Congress would also still need to approve any potential sale. Bearing in mind the sensitive military technologies involved, this could be far from straightforward. In particular, India is an enthusiastic customer of Russian defense products, including air defense systems. India operates the S-400 long-range surface-to-air missile system; the very same equipment that led to Turkey being ejected from the F-35 program in the past. More recently, the U.S. stance on transferring the F-35 to Turkey appears to have softened, but any such deal would still require Turkey to give up its S-400s. The final parts of the second Russian-made S-400 air defense system battery arrive at Murted Airbase in Ankara, Turkey, on September 15, 2019. Photo by TURKISH NATIONAL DEFENSE MINISTRY / HANDOUT/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images Anadolu Turkey had refused to give up its S-400 systems and had to sacrifice its F-35s (and an industrial stake in the program) as a result. Were India to be offered the same choice, it’s entirely unclear if it would agree. At the same time, while Turkey has acquired only a small number of different Russian-made weapons, India has long been one of Moscow’s biggest arms importers, resulting in a close military relationship and a significant ‘Russian lobby’ in Indian defense circles. Ahead of Trump’s announcement, Angad Singh, an Indian defense journalist and contributor to this website, also highlighted the S-400 as a major sticking point for any potential F-35 deal: 'Regardless of political winds in the United States, our case for the F-35 is complicated by the S-400 and the hordes of other Soviet/Russian equipment we operate.' An Indian Army T-90 tank, supplied by Russia, during a firepower demonstration at the Mahajan Firing Range, Rajasthan, in March 2004. RAVEENDRAN/AFP via Getty Images RAVEENDRAN In addition to traditional resistance to selling the highest-end U.S. defense technologies to countries operating particular Russian weapons systems, there is also the very real worry that these technologies could find their way into adversaries’ hands by other means. Concerns of this kind have derailed similar potential deals in the past. The United States has safeguards in place to keep sensitive military technology and capabilities from falling into Russian or Chinese hands, and India’s close ties with Moscow are likely to be a key factor in the approval of any F-35 deal. On the other hand, we are very much entering a new era in U.S. politics and foreign policy and it might well be the case that India’s relationship with Russia, and its Russian-made defense systems, are no longer seen as such a barrier to F-35 sales. Perhaps a deal could also be cut, in which India receives equivalent U.S. air defense systems to replace the S-400. While it’s highly significant that Trump would pitch the F-35 to India in this way, there are many more hurdles to negotiate before we even get to a point where a formal offer can be made. Essentially, what we are seeing now is a review of U.S. fifth-generation fighter policy for India. What happens next is very much unclear, with Indian fighter procurements already well known for their unpredictability.

Photo by MANJUNATH KIRAN/AFP via Getty Images MANJUNATH KIRAN Putting aside the F-35 for a moment, it’s also noteworthy that the U.S. government is increasing its efforts to establish defense ties with India. As well as the potential for more military sales, and not just of fighters, Washington may well be looking to take advantage of Russia’s weakened position on the international stage and take its place by forging a strong defense relationship with India. This would be especially important in terms of the broader geopolitical situation in the Indo-Pacific region, where both the United States and India view China as their main long-term security threat and strategic rival. 'In our meeting today, the prime minister and I reaffirmed that strong cooperation among the United States, India, Australia, and Japan, and it’s crucial really, to maintaining peace and prosperity tranquility, even, in the Indo-Pacific,' Trump said after his meeting with Modri. Ultimately, while the F-35 offer is about what could be a highly lucrative new fighter export deal for the U.S., it is just as much about driving a wedge between Moscow and New Delhi and helping build up the Indian military as a valuable counterbalance to China in the Indo-Pacific region.

Aircraft Carrier USS Harry S. Truman’s Collision Damage Seen In P...	The U.S. Navy has released an image showing damage to the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman following the collision with the cargo ship M/V Besiktas-M off the coast of Egypt in the Mediterranean Sea on Tuesday. Readers can first get up to speed on what had previously been known about the incident in our initial report here. The official caption for the picture is as follows: 'Exterior damage of USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75) viewed from a ship’s rigid-hull inflatable boat following a collision with merchant vessel Besiktas-M, Feb. 12, while operating in the vicinity of Port Said, Egypt. USS Harry S. Truman, the flagship of the Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group (HSTCSG), is on a scheduled deployment in the U.S. 6th Fleet area of operations supporting U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa to defend U.S., Allied and partner interests.' The picture, a full uncropped version of which is seen below, shows multiple large tears through a sponson on the starboard side of the stern end of the ship near one of the aircraft elevators. Whether there is damage elsewhere on the ship is unknown. USN A stock picture of the USS Harry S. Truman. The area that was damaged is right to the left of the aircraft elevator behind the island. USN A close look at the area that was damaged in the collision. USN The Navy has not released details about the estimated cost of or timeline for repairs, or about whether the damage in any way impedes the ship's ability to operate. Warships, especially supercarriers, are designed to withstand combat damage, but it is unclear whether Truman will head to port for repairs or continue on as planned. The carrier and its strike group have supported ongoing operations against Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen and ISIS-affiliated terrorists in Somalia in the past few months. Any substantial time in port for repairs now would have a major operational impact. The Navy did say previously that the collision had caused unspecified damage above the waterline, but had not caused any flooding, damage to aircraft on the deck, or injuries to members of the crew. The service also stressed that the ship's nuclear reactors were safe following the incident. A picture had already emerged yesterday appearing to show damage on the bow end of the starboard side of the Besiktas-M. Further details about the condition of the Panamanian-flagged cargo ship and its crew remain limited. A photo released from one of the crew of #BesiktasM after the collision with #Truman.

Drones Over U.S. Bases May Be Threatening Spy Flights: NORTHCOM C...	Some of the hundreds of drones flying over U.S. military bases and other sensitive areas last year were likely operated with nefarious intentions, the general coordinating the response to domestic incursions told a Senate hearing today. As a result, U.S. Air Force Gen. Gregory M. Guillot, commander of U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) and North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), testified that he needs increased authority to better protect these installations. 'The primary threat I see for them in the way they've been operating is detection and perhaps surveillance of sensitive capabilities on our installations,' Guillot explained to a Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) budget request hearing. He was responding to a question about the numerous drone incursions over U.S. military facilities, like the ones over Langley Air Force Base in 2023 that we were the first to cover. Guillot was not asked, nor did he volunteer information about who was operating these drones. A NORTHCOM spokesperson later declined to elaborate. Defense Officials Testify on 2026 Defense Budget Request @SASCGOP @SASCDems – LIVE online here: #SASC&mdash; CSPAN (@cspan) February 13, 2025 The limits on defending against drones are, at best, relegated to electronic warfare countermeasures, with simply providing awareness largely being the extent of the counter-drone systems deployed at installations in the United States. At this time, directed energy weapons, like lasers and high-power microwave systems, let alone kinetic capabilities, remain off-limits. This is a glaring issue we raised after our trip to see Guillot at his headquarters in Colorado Springs last year. The threat, Guillot told the committee, is widespread. 'There were 350 detections reported last year on military installations, and that was 350 over a total of 100 different installations of all types and levels of security,' Guillot pointed out. Last month, U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) told reporters that 'an aspect of this is our adversaries, it just makes sense that they would do this.' 'When I was stationed down at the Pax River Test Center, we used to have North Koreans on the fence,' Kelly explained. 'So how do you get better video of something? You get better video from a drone over the field than you can by standing at the fence of a military base.' NEW EXCLUSIVE: What UAPs? 'It's our adversaries,' Sen. Mark Kelly says foes regularly invade US airspace (unpaywalled) @AskaPol_uaps (@AskaPol_UAPs) February 8, 2025 As we previously reported, in the wake of drone incursions like those over Langley, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Picatinny Arsenal, and others, NORTHCOM was given the role of synchronizing the U.S. military response. U.S. INDOPACOM was given a similar role for the Pacific. This new role ensures 'standardized training, response, tactical techniques and procedures,' stated Guillot. 'And if the base and the service aren't able to handle the incursion, we can bring in help from across the interagency and DOD to support and, perhaps most critically, is we can work closely with the interagency to give them the authority to operate the systems once they arrive, due to our close relationship with the FAA.' In addition, 'in the near future, I think we will have our own capabilities to bring in from NORTHCOM once we procure them to assist if the service and the installation cannot handle the incursion.' However, the responsibility for defending these installations still rests with the local commanders. Often confusing legal and regulatory hurdles limit how and when many counter-drone systems can be employed within the homeland. Concerns about risks of collateral damage resulting from the use of active anti-drone capabilities factor very heavily, too into this equation. Guillot told the Senators that only about half of the 360 bases in the U.S. - considered 'covered installations - even have permission to defend against drones. This counter-drone system from Leidos demonstrated at Falcon Peak 2025 includes a drone that fires stringy streamers at other uncrewed aerial systems. (Howard Altman) There are nine criteria allowing bases to be covered, Guillot explained. 'It ranges from nuclear deterrence, missile defense all the way down to if it's a test facility,' he said. Given all these issues, Guillot said he wants to see an expansion of anti-drone authorities under U.S. law known as '130(i).' That’s a reference to subsection of Title 10 of the U.S. Code (10 USC 130i), covering current authorities for the 'protection of certain facilities and assets from unmanned aircraft.' Airmen train on how to spot suspicious aircraft and to use the Dronebuster to block radio signals, to potentially ground these aircraft. (U.S. Air Force photo by Tech. Sgt. Jeffery Foster) Tech. Sgt. Jeffery Foster Under 130i, the U.S. military has the authority to take 'action' to defend against drones including with measures to 'disrupt control of the unmanned aircraft system or unmanned aircraft, without prior consent, including by disabling the unmanned aircraft system or unmanned aircraft by intercepting, interfering, or causing interference with wire, oral, electronic, or radio communications used to control the unmanned aircraft system or unmanned aircraft' and the 'use reasonable force to disable, damage, or destroy the unmanned aircraft system or unmanned aircraft.' The law, however, does not go far enough, Guillot posited, saying it should be expanded to pertain to 'all military installations and not just those that are covered,' he urged. Guillot also asked Senators to expand the distance from a base that countermeasures can be employed. 'I'd also like to see the range expanded to slightly beyond the installation, so they don't have to wait for the threat to get over the installation before they can address it,' he proposed. That’s because 'many of these systems can use side-looking or slant range [sensors]. And so they could surveil the base from outside the perimeter, and under the current authorities, we can't address that.' Gen. Gregory Guillot, Commander, North American Aerospace Defense Command and U.S. Northern Command hosted distinguished visitors at Falcon Peak on Fort Carson, Colorado, Oct. 30, 2024. Falcon Peak is a USNORTHCOM led counter-small unmanned aircraft system experiment and the first Department of Defense C-sUAS initiative focused on detecting, tracking, and mitigating sUAS incursions at DoD installations in the United States. Falcon Peak occurred between Oct. 19-30, 2024. (U.S. Department of Defense photos by Josh Armstrong) An expansion of authority under 130 (i) is being considered. Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) explained that he and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) introduced legislation that would 'give these commanders the legal authority they need, plus the capability required to protect their bases from these kinds of incursions and then hold them accountable for doing so.' Any change in 130 (i) authorities would be on top of the Pentagon’s new counter-drone strategy it released in December, which you can read more about here. Among other things, it builds upon a number of existing efforts, including the establishment of the Joint Counter-small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Office (JCO) in 2020. It is also set to tie into a new Pentagon initiative to help speed up the acquisition and fielding of new counter-drone capabilities dubbed Replicator 2. The first Replicator effort has been focused on getting more uncrewed systems into the hands of U.S. warfighters. Because they took place outside the continental United States, the incursions last November over four U.S. Air Force bases in England, which we were also the first to write about, were not addressed by Guillot. Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD) Pacific Target Marine Operations (PTMO) and Threat/Target Systems Department (TTSD) recently deployed small-drones over Naval Base Ventura County (NBVC), Point Mugu to provide cost-effective unmanned aerial system (UAS) familiarization and threat training. NBVC is comprised of three distinct operational facilities: Point Mugu, Port Hueneme and San Nicolas Island. (U.S. Navy photo by Ensign Drew Verbis/Released) Ensign Drew Verbis The general also did not bring up the thousands of drone sightings that took place at the end of last year that were not over U.S. military installations or sensitive facilities. Biden administration officials downplayed that, saying those drones posed no threat nor had any foreign nexus. In addition, most of the sightings were likely not even drones. However, the incidents sparked an FBI investigation and spurred the FAA to issue scores of Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs), mostly over power facilities. We reached out to the FBI today to find out the status of that investigation. Last month, the FBI told us that they had no suspects and recovered no drones. U.S. President Donald Trump has taken a strong interest in drone incursions and declared he would tell the public what was actually happening in the first days of his administration. However, his press office later claimed that the so-called New Jersey Drones were largely FAA authorized or research-related. TWZ saw no evidence of large scale drone incursions over New Jersey, with a chronic issue of people reporting normal aircraft as mysterious drones being glaringly apparent. .@PressSec Karoline Leavitt reads statement from President Trump: 'The drones that were flying over New Jersey in large numbers were authorized to be flown by FAA for research and various other reasons&#8230;this was not the enemy.' pic.twitter.com/M5Qk5exLPn&mdash; CSPAN (@cspan) January 28, 2025 For years, The War Zone has raised concerns about dangers posed by drones, and had laid out a detailed case through dozens of reports that adversaries were taking advantage of the lack of aerial domain awareness over and above the homeland. The issue unidentified aerial phenomena, or UAP, is also tied up in this deeply, which is problematic in its own right. You can read all about this here. Guillot’s testimony is a clear acknowledgment of this reality and the challenges of defending against it. Whether it spurs Congress to give him greater authority to deal with the problem is something that we will know more about in the coming months.

Mystery Tiltrotor Aircraft Spotted At Mojave Air And Space Port I...	A vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft design that recently emerged at the Mojave Air & Space Port in California, which TWZ was first to report on, has been identified. It is a full-scale technology demonstrator (FSTD) belonging to Hyundai Motor Group subsidiary Supernal. Work on the FSTD, which was expected to fly for the first time last year, is feeding into the development of Supernal's S-A2 electrically-powered VTOL, or eVTOL, design. The Air Current was the first to report on Supernal's connection to the previously unseen aircraft at Mojave. Photographer Matt Hartman had previously taken pictures of the aircraft and posted them on social media. Supernal has been working with other firms to craft the FSTD, including U.K.-based GKN Aerospace. TWZ has reached out to both companies for more details about the demonstrator. A closer look at what has now been identified as a full-scale technology demonstrator (FSTD) belonging to Hyundai subsidiary Supernal. Matt Hartman Supernal did announce last July that GKN had delivered the complete composite wing assembly for the FSTD and that the aircraft's tail booms were expected to arrive by the end of that month. A previously released picture of the wing structure, seen below, and the mention of booms align fully with the aircraft that has now emerged at Mojave. Supernal/GKN Aerospace The picture of the wing assembly does raise new questions about whether the four wing-mounted rotors on the FSTD are indeed fixed, as had appeared to be the case from what was visible in Hartman's pictures, or can articulate between vertical and horizontal facing modes. The aircraft does have two larger additional rotors in clearly tilting wing-tip nacelle pods. Otherwise, details about the FSTD remain limited, but readers can find TWZ's full initial analysis of the design here. The FSTD does differ substantially from the S-A2 concept that Supernal officially unveiled at the 2024 Farnborough Airshow in the United Kingdom. That design has four pairs of tilting rotor assemblies, two on each wing, as well as a v-tail rather than a twin-boom type. The center fuselage also has a more streamlined look with a single-piece main windscreen. The internal configuration that has been shown so far consists of a single pilot seated in front and space for four passengers in the cabin behind. 'S-A2 will cruise at 120 mph and have an initial range of 60 miles to meet typical city operation needs. The aircraft utilizes a distributed electric propulsion architecture and will operate quietly to meet community noise standards,' according to a previous Supernal press release. 'Most importantly, S-A2 is engineered to achieve global commercial aviation safety standards with a robust airframe structure that includes redundant components in critical systems such as powertrain, flight controls, and avionics.' Supernal has been targeting a first flight for the S-A2, which it also says will have a total payload capacity of 1,000 pounds, in 2026 and hopes to see the aircraft enter commercial service in 2028. The FSTD, which as noted was expected to fly for the first time last year, has been presented as an important risk-reduction asset in support of the S-A2 development plan. '2024 is a pivotal year for Supernal’s eVTOL development, marking the transition from engineering design to the build and execution phases,' David McBride, the company's Chief Technology officer, said in a statement around the unveiling at Farnborough last year. 'In addition to gaining instrumental learnings from our full-scale technology demonstrator, we will also begin prototype development and continue refining our production vehicle for scaled manufacturing in the coming months.' A rendering of the S-A2 design showing its tilting rotor assemblies in their vertical takeoff and landing mode. Supernal As TWZ highlighted in our initial report on this aircraft, the market space for crewed and uncrewed eVTOLs, as well as hybrid-electric designs that use turbines to produce electricity to drive the rotors, has dramatically expanded in recent years. The commercial aviation sector has been a key focus of these development efforts, including Supernal's S-A2. Armed forces, including the U.S. military, are also working to field or at least evaluate new VTOL designs, including eVTOL types, to perform a variety of missions. As we wrote previously: 'For the U.S. military, interest in new VTOL aircraft designs, including the active development of types with more traditional propulsion arrangements, is being driven in part by a desire for greater runway independence amid concerns about the growing vulnerability of air bases, as well as other established facilities, during a future high-end conflict. This, in turn, has led to the development of new concepts of operations focused heavily on expeditionary and distributed operations, including in remote and austere sites with limited existing infrastructure. New VTOL designs, especially uncrewed ones, are also increasingly viewed as important components of future supply chains for forces in forward areas, including right on the front lines. Casualty evacuation and the extraction of downed pilots, including from behind enemy lines, have also been presented as potential roles for such aircraft.' When it comes to work on Supernal's S-A2, specifically, the company's FSTD is now undergoing at least some degree of testing at Mojave.

Structure At Chinese Shipyard May Point To China’s Next Aircraft ...	We may have just gotten our first sight of China’s next-generation aircraft carrier, generally referred to as the Type 004 — or at least a portion of it. Construction work at a shipyard in Dalian, in China’s Liaoning province, reveals a module that is consistent with an aircraft carrier — which would be China’s fourth, once it enters service — although there remain questions about the precise nature of the object, which may be intended for testing, rather than as part of the finished warship. The module in question, apparently a section of the flight deck, is seen in satellite imagery provided by Google Earth and which first began to circulate on Chinese defense forums. The imagery dates back to May 2024 but was only recently published. Close to the module are mockups of a J-15 Flanker series carrier-based fighter and a Z-8 series naval helicopter. Mockups of this kind are frequently used in carrier development work in China, both on land and at sea. A wider view of the module at Dalian, in a satellite image dated May 17, 2024. Google Earth Well, you all know how sceptical I am usually, but this could actually be proof for the first time that 004 is under construction! @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) February 13, 2025 Provided that what appear as lines running along the module are trenches for catapult tracks, which seems the most likely explanation, this would suggest that the Type 004 will have two waist catapults, in addition to the two bow catapults. This would match the arrangement of the U.S. Navy’s Ford class and would add an extra catapult compared with China’s third carrier, the Type 003 Fujian, which has a single catapult in the waist position.

Google Earth TWZ spoke to Alex Luck, a journalist who closely follows the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), for his assessment of the module. Noting that it’s probably too early to make any concrete assessment about the role of this particular module, Luck says that the Dalian location makes sense for a new carrier, with the adjacent dock already used for carrier construction and maintenance. On the other hand, as Luck points out, the first modules spotted for the Fujian, back in 2018, were lower hull segments, rather than a flight deck module, which seems to be what we are looking at here. China’s third aircraft carrier, the Fujian, shortly before it went to sea for the first time in April 2024. via X via X Since lower hull segments make more sense in terms of procedural assembly, it could be the case that this is not a production module but instead a test or demonstrator segment for the future flattop. There is a precedent for this, with a demonstrator module for the future Fujian noted at Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai, back in 2013. With that in mind, a similar approach for the Type 004, involving test portions of the new carrier, to iron out any early problems with the design, wouldn’t be entirely surprising. A demonstrator module for the future Fujian at Jiangnan Shipyard in 2013. via Chinese Internet As for the presence of the aircraft mockups next to the new module, Luck observes that these are likely not necessarily directly related to the new carrier, with the same ones probably having been used for the Liaoning and the Shandong beforehand. Previous rumors had suggested that the Type 004 might be built at a different location, namely Dalian Dagushan, located across the bay from Xianglujiao, so that too raises some questions about the purpose of the module. Dalian Dagushan is where the most recent Type 055 ‘super-destroyers’ and Type 052DL destroyers are being built but, again, we don’t know for sure that the Type 004 will also be built here. The respective locations of Xianglujiao (where the Type 004 module was seen) and Dalian Dagushan. Google Earth Previously, there had also been speculation that the Type 004 might be constructed at Jiangnan, which produced the Fujian, and this shipyard also offered some concept art depicting a new aircraft carrier design. The carrier shown in that artwork had some broad external similarities to the U.S. Navy’s Ford class and France’s future New Generation Aircraft Carrier, although, at this stage, we really can’t say what the Type 004 will look like. An artist’s concept of a future Chinese aircraft carrier. Chinese internet via @HenriKenhmann Whatever the role of the new module, there’s certainly a strong possibility that it’s related to China’s next carrier, with previous suggestions that the Type 004 could enter service sometime in the late 2020s. When it does finally appear, the Type 004 is expected to be a notably more advanced design than Liaoning and Shandong, which are by now well established with the PLAN fleet, as well as the Fujian, the country’s first domestically produced carrier, which is still preparing for operational service. Launched in 2022, the Fujian began sea trials in mid-2024 and is expected to enter operational service in 2025, according to the U.S. Department of Defense. Like Fujian — and in contrast to the two previous carriers — the Type 004 will be equipped to launch aircraft via catapults. The PLAN’s two in-service carriers, the Shandong and the Lioaning, are both short takeoff but arrested recovery, or STOBAR, types with prominent ‘ski jump’ takeoff ramps. Catapults offer manifold advantages, especially when it comes to launching aircraft at higher gross weights, which translates to larger fuel and ordnance loads. They can also generally accommodate a wider array of aircraft types, too. This includes larger and slower designs, like the still-in-development KJ-600 carrier-based airborne early warning and control aircraft, as well as smaller ones, such as drones. A satellite view of a prototype KJ-600. via Chinese Internet Another satellite image shows a KJ-600 prototype in the green primer paint now frequently seen on Chinese naval aircraft. via Chinese internet Presumably, the Type 004 will have an advanced electromagnetic aircraft launch system (EMALS), provided it proves to be successful on the Fujian. Otherwise, this type of equipment is currently only in use with the U.S. Navy. Aside from the KJ-600, the air wing for the new carrier will likely include the J-35 stealth fighter, supported by advanced versions of the J-15 multirole fighter. The carrier is also likely to host various drones, such as navalized versions of the GJ-11 Sharp Sword uncrewed combat aerial vehicle (UCAV), plus helicopters. One of the first prototypes of the carrier-based J-35 stealth fighter. via Chinese internet There have long been reports that the Type 004 will be a nuclear-powered vessel, which would give it effectively unlimited range and help meet the power-generation demands of ever-improving sensors, other mission systems, and possibly directed-energy weapons. At this stage, that remains unconfirmed but would certainly be in line with the PLAN’s expanding carrier ambitions. As well as its aircraft carriers, China is meanwhile also working to introduce a number of very large big-deck amphibious assault ships, referred to as the Type 076. Each will feature at least one electromagnetic catapult that is expected to be primarily used to launch drones, as you can read more about here. In its latest assessment of Chinese military power, the Pentagon doesn’t explicitly mention the Type 004, but does state that the PLAN is 'in the beginning stages of operating its multi-carrier force.' It also notes that the Fujian is just the first warship within a 'nextgeneration of carriers' that will be characterized by 'greater endurance and an electromagnetic catapult launch system, making them capable of launching various types of specialized fixed-wing aircraft for missions, such as airborne early warning and electronic warfare. This will increase the striking power of a potential PLAN carrier battle group when deployed to areas beyond the PRC’s immediate periphery.' While the PLAN’s carrier force is still clearly outmatched by the U.S. Navy’s fleet of 11 active nuclear-powered supercarriers, China is already benefiting from having multiple carriers to draw on, and this advantage is set to become more pronounced in the years to come. As the Chinese military buildup continues, the Type 004 future aircraft carrier is clearly a program to watch.

Trump Admin Makes Major Moves For Negotiated End Of Ukraine War	U.S. President Donald Trump made major moves to end the war in Ukraine on Wednesday, saying that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to peace talks that would begin 'immediately.' The actions came after U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said America was no longer 'primarily focused on the security of Europe,' and that the idea that Ukraine would not have to cede territory to Russia in order to end the conflict is not realistic. In 'a lengthy and highly productive phone call' with Putin, the two 'agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately,' Trump said in a social media post, adding that the process began by informing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky of the conversation. He also suggested that he and Putin agreed to visit 'each other’s nations.' Trump said he instructed Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of the CIA John Ratcliffe, National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, and Ambassador and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, 'to lead the negotiations which, I feel strongly, will be successful.'

'It would certainly seem unlikely,' Trump said, adding that Russia 'took a lot of land' and 'lost a lot of soldiers&#8230;I'm not making an opinion on it but I read a lot on it and a lot of people think that's unlikely.'

'We want, like you, a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine, but we must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective,' said Hegseth ahead of his first meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group. 'Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering. A durable peace for Ukraine must include robust security guarantees to ensure that the war will not begin again.' Ukraine’s joining NATO is also unrealistic, Hegseth declared, adding that any future security arrangement will not involve U.S. troops on the ground. Meanwhile, Hegseth suggested that the U.S. will now focus far more heavily on its needs over Europe’s. The U.S., he avowed, 'faces consequential threats to our homeland. We are focusing on the security of our own borders. We also face a peer competitor in the Communist Chinese with the capability and intent to threaten our homeland and core national interests in the Indo-Pacific. The U.S. is prioritizing deterring war with China in the Pacific, recognizing the reality of scarcity, and making the resourcing trade-offs to ensure deterrence does not fail. Deterrence cannot fail for all of our states as the United States prioritizes its attention to these threats. European allies must lead from the front.' Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth (@SecDef) February 12, 2025 Trump’s major official push into the Russia-Ukraine diplomatic process comes as European leaders are discussing the future of this conflict and ways to support Ukraine goring forward.

The Kyiv Independent (@KyivIndependent) February 10, 2025 Despite U.S. pressure, Zelensky has refused to draft those under 25 years of age. However, Ukraine is trying a new approach to meet its desperate need for additional troops. 'Starting Tuesday, Kyiv is now enticing young people to join the army with lucrative military contracts, offering a million hryvnias (about €23,000), social benefits and elite training for volunteers who sign up before they turn 25,' Politico reported on Wednesday. 'But this decision has angered some Ukrainian soldiers who voluntarily joined the army and are still serving despite no prospect of demobilization in sight — while not getting the same benefits as those offered to the youngsters.' Ukraine 'devalues ​​all those who voluntarily joined the army at the beginning of a full-scale war,' Masi Nayyem, a Ukrainian serviceman and prominent lawyer, said in a Facebook post. Kyiv rejects lowering the draft age from 25 to 18 despite US pressure. Instead, it’s launching a new approach: Starting today, Ukraine offers young volunteers €23K, social benefits & elite training if they enlist before 25.

'In general, we can say that the 'Soloist is a one-time adjustable infantry munition with first-person control and the possibility of attacking targets (primarily armored vehicles) from above,' IZ reported. 'Moreover, the operator can work from the shelter, being quite far from the target. And the range of 10 km exceeds the existing anti-tank missile systems and approaches the 120-mm mortars.' In addition, 'as a combat load, the Soloist can use regular ammunition from RPG-7 and LNG-9 grenade launchers - the most common in the Russian army, and possibly in the world.' IZ noted. The weapons can use high-explosive, shrapnel or thermobaric warheads. 'It is important to note that the 'Soloist' is still not a UAV, namely, an adjustable munition,' IZ explained.

Containerized SAM System That Fires Soviet Air-To-Air Missiles Fo...	We now have our first look at the containerized Gravehawk surface-to-air missile system, which uses repurposed Soviet-era heat-seeking R-73 air-to-air missiles as interceptors, that the United Kingdom and Denmark have developed for Ukraine. Gravehawk is the latest in a series of what have become commonly referred to as 'FrankenSAMs' that leverage existing capabilities within the Ukrainian armed forces' arsenal to help rapidly provide badly needed additional air defenses. Forces News in the United Kingdom was first to publish the pictures and video of Gravehawk, and to report on additional details about the system and its development. British authorities first disclosed the existence of the Gravehawk project in January, but provided only limited information and no visuals at that time. The slightly mad scientists at the UK MOD have revealed the Gravehawk surface-to-air missile system for Ukrainian service. The entire SAM system fits in a standard shipping container, carries a pair of converted R-73 AAMs, and can be quickly deployed off the back of a flatbed. pic.twitter.com/BTF0b7LjCg&mdash; OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) February 12, 2025 It took a U.K. Ministry of Defense element called Taskforce Kindred and an unspecified group of private contractors approximately 18 months and six million pounds (almost $7.5 million based on the rate of conversion at the time of writing) to develop Gravehawk, according to Forces News. The unit cost is around one million pounds ($1.24 million). The entire system fits inside a modified ISO shipping container with a retractable roof. Two Gravehawks have been delivered to Ukraine to date and have already been used in combat, and the country is set to eventually get 15 more of them. Forces News' report indicates that Gravehawk is intended to be emplaced on the ground before use and it is unclear if it can employed while is still on the back of a truck. An eight-wheeled Leyland DAF truck equipped with the Demountable Rack Offload and Pickup System (DROPS) capable of relatively quickly loading and unloading containers is seen alongside Gravehawk in the imagery that has now been released. A Leyland DAF DROPS truck with a Gravehawk system seen behind it. UK MoD via Forces News When it comes to targeting, Gravehawk has a retractable sensor system that contains at least one infrared camera, which is used to spot and track targets, and cue the R-73 missiles to them, per Forces News. The main fire control unit fits inside a Pelican-like case as seen below. UK MoD via Forces News As TWZ has previously written about the R-73, also known to NATO as the AA-11 Archer: 'The R-73, in air-launched form, has a maximum range of 18.6 miles against a head-on target of 8.7 miles against a tail-on target. A ground-launched application would have reduced range since the missile wouldn’t benefit from the speed and altitude parameters of the launch aircraft. In this case, it’s perhaps more relevant to look at the seeker range of the R-73, which would remain broadly the same for ground launch: 6.2-7.5 miles.' &#8230; 'The R-73 is a high-off-boresight (HOBS) weapon, with a seeker that can articulate in any direction much farther than a traditional heat-seeking air-to-air missile with a fixed non-HOBS seeker that stares directly forward. Aided by a helmet-mounted sight, the Archer can be launched in air-to-air engagements against targets with off-boresight angles of +/-75 degrees. This gives the R-73 the potential to be a particularly potent, albeit improvised threat for locking onto and engaging dynamic targets with minimal assisting sensors when used in a surface-launched form.' R-73's HOBS seeker looks to be particularly important in this case given that Gravehawk's launch rails otherwise offer a fixed field of fire. There is also a clear relationship between Gravehawk and another FrankenSAM the United Kingdom previously supplied to Ukraine that uses the AIM-132 Advanced Short-Range Air-to-Air Missile (ASRAAM) as its interceptor and that was mounted on a 6&#215;6 Supacat High Mobility Transporter (HMT). Both systems notably appear to use similar, if not identical sensor systems. A side-by-side look at the Gravehawk's sensor system, at left, and the other British-developed surface-to-air missile system for Ukraine that uses the AIM-132, at left. UK MoD via Forces News / Ukrainian Armed Forces Though not necessarily as mobile as the Supacat-based system, Gravehawk's containerized nature does still offer considerable flexibility when it comes to positioning and repositioning it. It also has the benefit of being less obvious as a valuable air defense system while on the move than other types in Ukrainian service. Gravehawk's development is said to have been prompted largely by Russian long-range kamikaze drone and cruise missile threats, which could also point more to static employment defending critical infrastructure. The system is also said to be capable of engaging fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. Bolster Ukraine's air defenses, in general, has been a key focus of the country's Western partner for years now. Earlier on in the conflict, there were concerns that the Ukrainian military's stock of surface-to-air missiles for its existing Soviet-era air defense systems would run dry. The passive nature of the Gravehawk's infrared sensors means that it is not vulnerable to detection by Russian electronic warfare systems, unlike surface-to-air missile systems that rely on active radars. That also means they are unlikely to show up in any electronic order of battle of Ukrainian defenses used for route planning for drone and cruise missile attacks. There is a question of how deep Ukraine's stocks of R-73s, which also arm its MiG-29 Fulcrum and Su-27 Flanker fighters, might be, but the missiles have already been in growing use in the surface-to-air role. In addition to Gravehawk, Ukraine has already fielded modified 9K33 Osa (NATO designation SA-8 Gecko) wheeled air defense vehicles armed with these missiles instead of their usual 9M33 interceptors. The Ukrainian military also has R-73-armed uncrewed surface vessels (USV). Whether or not Gravehawk could be adapted to fire other missiles like the aforementioned AIM-132 or U.S.-made AIM-9 Sidewinders, which Ukraine has also received for air-to-air and surface-to-air use, is unclear. A Ukrainian 9K33 Osa (SA-8) modified to fire R-73 missiles. Come Back Alive A still from a Russian Ministry of Defense video shows a single R-73 on one of two angled rails mounted on the rear of a Ukrainian USV. Russian Ministry of Defense screencap It's also worth noting here that the conflict in Ukraine is not the first time we've seen R-73s and other Soviet-era air-to-air missiles adapted for the air-to-air role. Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen did so years ago. Interestingly, 'the Ukrainians initially didn't want Gravehawk, instead they wanted more air-to-air missiles and F-16 Fighting Falcons,' according to Forces News. 'But having seen it in action they are now apparently sold on it – and want lots more.' Gravehawk's emergence does now come amid newly serious questions about the future of foreign military assistance for Ukraine, especially from the United States. President Donald Trump said today that he will start negotiations to end the conflict with Russia's President Putin. At the latest gathering of the multi-national Ukraine Defense Contact Group earlier today, U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth also said Ukraine's desire to regain territory Russia has occupied since 2014 is unrealistic, as are its ambitions for NATO membership. European partners like the United Kingdom look set to be even more important for Ukraine in the near future. The U.K. Ministry of Defense's initial disclosure of Graveyhawk came as part of an announcement of an additional 4.5 billion pounds ($5.6 billion) in planned military aid for the Ukrainain Forces this year. With Gravehawk already combat-proven, a growing number of them look set to be valuable additions to Ukraine's air defense arsenal and that will allow the country to make expanded use of R-73 missile stockpiles in the surface-to-air role.

EA-18G Growler Crashes Into San Diego Bay	Details remain very limited, but an EA-18G Growler electronic attack jet has crashed off Point Loma, which marks the entrance to San Diego Bay, on Wednesday morning. The sprawling Naval Air Station North Island sits across from Point Loma, with MCAS Miramar located inland roughly 15 miles to the north. A major exercise, the latest iteration of Bamboo Eagle, which you can read all about here, is ongoing off the Southern California coast. It's not clear if the crash is connected to this large-scale training event. San Diego Webcam on X, which has cameras up around the bay, was first to report of the crash. Local ABC affiliate Channel 10 News reports two crew were rescued shortly after the crash. Their crews saw the aircraft crash into the bay. BREAKING: Report of pilot ejection over the bay.

New Shots Of Ukrainian F-16s Shine Light On Combat Missions	Recently emerged imagery of Ukrainian Air Force F-16s shows the fighters carrying a variety of weapons and other stores, apparently in the course of combat sorties, providing an interesting look at the type’s operational service in the war with Russia. The new imagery reveals specific details of load-outs used in operational air-to-air and air-to-ground missions, including some weapons not previously seen on these jets. While the quality of these images varies, the clearest example shows an F-16 apparently returning from a daytime combat air patrol sortie and preparing to land. This seems to have been first posted by the Ukrainian Soniah_Hub channel on the Telegram messaging app. Ukrainian Air Force F-16AM Fighting Falcon returning from a combat air patrol, having expended one of its AIM-120C-series AMRAAM missiles. Appears to be the first confirmation that Ukrainian Falcons are sporting the more advanced and longer-ranged C-series AMRAAMS. pic.twitter.com/oK7TLUOCbW&mdash; OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) February 11, 2025 Seen from below, the fighter is carrying two AIM-9X Sidewinder infrared-guided air-to-air missiles and a single AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM). This suggests that one AMRAAM was expended in combat, although it’s also possible, if far less likely, that the jet may have launched with this asymmetric load. We haven’t previously seen the AIM-9X on Ukrainian F-16s, with earlier imagery showing the jets fitted with the earlier AIM-9L/M. Compared with the AIM-9L/M, the AIM-9X offers a more potent short-range air-to-air missile capability that can be used in conjunction with the F-16’s Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) for high off-boresight (HOBS) engagements. While we know that JHMCS was supplied together with the F-16s, even without it, the AIM-9X is a very valuable weapon that is particularly relevant for defending against drones and cruise missiles. You can read all about employing AIM-9X without a helmet-mounted sight here. A screencap from an official video showing a Ukrainian F-16 pilot wearing JHMCS. Ukrainian Ministry of Defense screencap Another weapon seen for the first time on a Ukrainian F-16 is the AIM-120C version of the AMRAAM, on the left wingtip rail. This version can be identified on account of its cropped fins for internal carriage in the F-22 and F-35. Source- image of a Ukrainian Falcon sporting a more advanced C-series AMRAAM with clipped wings. pic.twitter.com/yMaVwbKiYw&mdash; OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) February 11, 2025 As we’ve discussed in the past, the AIM-120C offers some significant advantages over the earlier AIM-120A/B models. Aside from this, the AMRAAM is significant in that it’s Ukraine’s first active-radar-guided air-to-air missile. This is a class of weapons that was long sought after by Ukraine. One of its fighter pilots, the late Andrii Pilshchykov, better known by his callsign 'Juice,' told TWZ: 'The lack of fire and forget missiles is the greatest problem for us.' A U.S. Air Force F-16C armed with AIM-120C AMRAAM, AIM-9L/M Sidewinder, and AGM-88 HARM missiles. U.S. Air Force The AIM-120C features an improved guidance system and enhanced resistance to countermeasures, although perhaps the single most important factor for Ukraine is its additional range, reportedly a feature of later subvariants (like the AIM-120C-5 and C-7). This would provide the Ukrainian Air Force with a counter of sorts to Russia’s long-range R-37M air-to-air missile. Typical Russian tactics involve firing the R-37M from outside the range of the missiles carried by Ukrainian fighters. While the AIM-120C won’t offer parity with the R-37M, any way of increasing the lethal range of the F-16, as a counter to Russian fighters, will be very welcome. A Russian Su-35S launches an R-37M air-to-air missile. Russian Ministry of Defense The same F-16 is also carrying three external fuel tanks, to maximize its endurance, an especially important factor considering Ukraine has no air-to-air refueling assets. Of poorer quality is a brief video that emerged recently showing an F-16 streaking at low level, purportedly close to the front lines. Earlier today, footage emerged of what is possibly the first sighting of a Ukrainian Air Force F-16AM Fighting Falcon on a strike mission, making a low-level pass. These are the first images of a Ukrainian Falcon sporting a full loadout of US-supplied GBU-39 SDB glide bombs. pic.twitter.com/QTyoBffEJX&mdash; OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) February 10, 2025 A screenshot of the above video, showing an air-to-ground-tasked F-16. via X It’s hard to make out all of the details of the aircraft’s load-out but it appears to be configured for an air-to-ground mission. In particular, stations 3 and 7 under the wings look to be fitted with BRU-61 racks, each of which can carry four GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs (SDBs). The Ukrainian Air Force is already making extensive use of the SDB launched from Soviet-era MiG-29 and Su-27 fighters and it’s not a huge surprise to see the same store being hauled into battle by the F-16. A screencap from a video taken from the cockpit of a Ukrainian Air Force Su-27 shows the fighter lobbing a GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) toward a Russian target. via X via X The SDB offers numerous advantages as an air-to-ground weapon for the F-16. As well as the ability to carry relatively large numbers of these stores, the SDB offers a high level of accuracy and a useful standoff range, and it can be used to strike semi-hardened static targets. Just as importantly, large numbers of SDBs are available in existing NATO stockpiles. Interestingly, the F-16AM version that is being supplied to Ukraine by a coalition of Western partners is not widely associated with the SDB. In fact, it seems that, of the various F-16AM/BM operators, only the Netherlands used the SDB with these MLU-upgraded aircraft. SDBs loaded on a Royal Netherlands Air Force F-16AM. Dutch Ministry of Defense There are also two underwing fuel tanks and an AN/ALQ-131 electronic countermeasures pod carried on the centerline. A podded electronic warfare capability of this kind gives the F-16 a valuable extra layer of survivability, especially important when flying air-to-ground missions in close proximity to the battlefield and its ever-present ground-based air defense threat. As for the ALQ-131, this widely used pod tackles provides self-protection against radar threats, responding to them with a combination of noise, repeater, or transponder electronic jamming techniques. The pod has a modular design and can operate across multiple frequency bands, also being rapidly re-programmed to address changing threats.

Matt Hecht/Released It is especially interesting that the ALQ-131 being carried by this F-16 is just one part of the aircraft’s electronic warfare self-protection suite, reflecting the intensity of the threat. Ukrainian F-16s are also equipped with Pylon Integrated Dispensing System Plus (PIDS+) systems, and perhaps also the more advanced Electronic Combat Integrated Pylon System Plus (ECIPS+), both of which are made by the Terma company in Denmark. Both these pylons are bolt-on self-defense systems that feature missile approach warning sensors (MAWS) that can detect incoming missile threats, while the PIDS+ also has additional dispensers for chaff and flares. The pylons can also provide radar warning and homing receiver capabilities, which give the pilot situational awareness of radar-based threats.

Ukrainian Air Force Rear shot of a Ukrainian F-16 with the Terma self-protection pylon, live AIM-9L/M, and a captive carry (inert) AIM-120B AMRAAM. Ukrainian Ministry of Defense screencap As we have discussed before, prior to their delivery, Ukraine’s F-16s had their electronic warfare systems optimized, with U.S. Air Force assistance, to better defend those jets against Russian threats. As part of ongoing collaboration on this front, the Ukrainians will pass data they collect in combat back to the United States to help further refine and improve electronic warfare capabilities available to both countries, as well as other allies and partners. Defensive weapons appear to comprise two Sidewinders under the wings (these may well be AIM-9L/M versions, in this case) as well as AMRAAMs on the wingtips. Those wingtip stores don’t necessarily look like AMRAAMs, but there doesn’t seem to be any other immediate alternative for this location and what we are probably seeing is the distorted effect of the pixelation and generally lower-quality video. Overall, while it appears the Ukrainian F-16s were introduced to combat primarily in an air defense capacity, especially in the protection of cities and infrastructure against Russian drone and cruise missile attacks, the aircraft is now flying air-to-ground sorties too, making fuller use of its multirole capabilities. The introduction of the F-16 by the Ukrainian Air Force hasn’t been entirely without problems. In August 2024, less than a month after the type was first confirmed as being in the country, Ukraine confirmed the loss of its first F-16 and one of its pilots in a crash during a combat mission. A screencap from an official video showing a Ukrainian F-16 equipped with four AIM-9L/Ms and a Terma self-protection pylon. Ukrainian Ministry of Defense screencap Since then, deliveries of F-16s to Ukraine have been delayed. In particular, deliveries of the F-16s promised by Belgium were expected to begin before the end of 2024, but this has yet to happen. The problem is a lack of trained Ukrainian pilots and spare parts, according to the Belgian Ministry of Defense. Last week, however, it was reported that a batch of former Dutch F-16s had also arrived in Ukraine. In all, around 85 F-16s have now been promised to Ukraine. These comprise 24 from the Netherlands, 19 from Denmark, and 12 from Norway (with the same country providing 10 more that will be used for spare parts), while Belgium says it will supply 30. As more F-16s arrive, and the type becomes better established in Ukrainian service, we should learn more about the kinds of missions that it’s flying. At the same time, with a wide range of potential weapons and stores compatible with the Viper, we’re almost certain to see other and more varied load-outs on these aircraft as they expand their mission profiles.

Algeria Says It’s The Su-57 Felon’s First Export Customer	Algeria’s state-run media has announced that the country is the first export customer for Russia’s Su-57 Felon new-generation fighter. The development follows a statement earlier this week from Russia that an undisclosed foreign customer will start to receive Su-57s this year. The vote of confidence could help improve the fortunes of the Su-57, which has so far suffered from a failed partnership with India and limited Russian orders and deliveries. Information about the Algerian Su-57 order was provided by the country’s state television network, which also reported that Algerian pilots are currently undergoing training on the fighter in Russia. The deliveries are expected to begin later this year, the same source said, although the number of aircraft ordered and the cost of the deal remain unclear. Algerian TV confirms Su-57 fighter jet deal with Russia.'Algerian pilots are training in Russia, and deliveries are expected this year.'Algeria becomes the first Su-57 customer. pic.twitter.com/UGEgFvY92m&mdash; Clash Report (@clashreport) February 12, 2025 On Monday, Rosoboronexport, Russia’s state-run arms export/import agency, said that Su-57s would be delivered to an undisclosed foreign customer starting this year, but provided no details as to that nation’s identity. The statement was made at the opening of the Aero India 2025 international airshow by Rosoboronexport Chief Alexander Mikheev. In November 2024, during Airshow China at Zhuhai, Mikheev also announced the signature of 'the first contracts for the [sale of] Su-57 aircraft' to a foreign country. Again, he declined to name the customer or to discuss any planned delivery schedule. A Su-57 performs at Airshow China 2024, on November 7, 2024, in Zhuhai, Guangdong province. Photo by VCG/VCG via Getty Images qian bai hua Unconfirmed accounts suggest that Algeria may initially be acquiring just six Su-57s. If true, that could suggest that an initial batch will be used for evaluation, or it might be that Russia is able to supply an initial batch of six, with more to follow. Regardless, Russia’s claim that deliveries of Su-57s to a foreign customer will start this year looks questionable. In fact, the Su-57’s sluggish production output is a potentially significant obstacle in terms of export orders — at least if a client requires the aircraft in larger numbers. Although the Felon was first flown in T-50 prototype form back in 2010, the program has made only very slow progress, hampered by a lack of investment in the form of foreign orders. A significant blow was struck by India’s withdrawal from the program, with that country’s investment having been considered vital to speed development. The same had been true in the late 1990s when India’s purchase of the Su-30MKI Flanker essentially secured the development of the multirole version of this fighter, which was only later acquired by Russia. With a Su-57 on static display in the foreground, an Indian Air Force Su-30MKI lands at Aero India 2025, at Yelahanka Air Force Station in Bengaluru, on February 11, 2025. Photo by Arun SANKAR / AFP ARUN SANKAR Meanwhile, the Russian Aerospace Forces only began to receive series-built Su-57s in 2022, part of an order for 76 aircraft — a notably small production run. While at least six aircraft were delivered to the Russian Aerospace Forces in 2022, more than 10 were handed over in 2023 before numbers tailed off again in 2024 when likely only two or three more were received. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and the subsequent international sanctions, have certainly played a role in the slow pace of deliveries, with little prospect that this will change any time soon. Those same sanctions, as well as Moscow’s increasing pariah status, have further reduced the chances of export success. In an effort to drum up foreign interest, Russia has also offered a degree of local production of the Su-57, specifically with the hope of securing sales from India and the United Arab Emirates. Russia has also attempted to use the Su-57’s supposed combat performance — in Syria and Ukraine — as a way to drum up interest in the fighter. However, the apparent operational evaluation in Syria appears to have been of very limited scope, while few hard details have emerged about how the Su-57 has been used in the war in Ukraine. Most notably, perhaps, at least one and maybe two Su-57s were struck by Ukrainian drones at an air base deep inside Russia, as you can read about here.

GUR Another hurdle is the fact that the export version of the Felon — the Su-57E — has yet to appear in hardware form. While the ‘Su-57E’ has been presented at airshows previously — notably at Zhuhai — the aircraft was actually the fourth T-50 prototype. As the export version, the Su-57E is likely to be somewhat downgraded, as well as having a different identification friend or foe (IFF) system, and cockpit displays calibrated in Imperial units and the English language. In the past, it’s been suggested that non-Russian weapons could be integrated if required. With this in mind, the Su-57E is certainly more achievable than the advanced Su-57M version, which has long been promised but has so far made little tangible progress. Central to the Su-57M is the new AL-51F-1 (izdeliye 30) turbofan engine, replacing the current AL-41F-1, with increased thrust, lighter weight, and lower operating costs. This, too, has moved at a glacial pace, not helped by the low level of interest from Russia, let alone on the export market. A view of the flat version of the thrust-vectoring nozzle developed for the AL-51F1 (in the left engine nacelle), alongside the original three-dimensional version (right nacelle). via X For the Algerian Air Force, however, the Su-57E would be a significant advance, reinforcing its status as the most powerful air arm in the region. With its reduced radar signature, supersonic cruising speed, high level of agility, and advanced sensor suite, the Su-57 provides a combination of capabilities not found in any other African air arm. The backbone of the Algerian Air Force has long been provided by Russian-made equipment, currently including 63 Su-30MKA and 40 MiG-29S/M/M2 multirole fighters, 42 Su-24MK2 strike/reconnaissance aircraft, and 16 Yak-130 combat trainers. It also operates 33 Russian-made Mi-24 Mk III and 42 Mi-28NE attack helicopters. All those figures are for 2024 and are published by FlightGlobal. This has all been enabled by the highest level of defense spending in Africa, supported by one of the continent’s largest economies in Africa, due mostly to its large oil and gas reserves. Traditionally, the Algerian Air Force has been built up to face off the potential threat from Morocco, with which Algeria went to war over the contested Western Sahara region, in 1976. In the 1990s, Algeria was engaged in a civil war, pitting the armed forces against various Islamist rebel groups. Beginning in the 2000s, meanwhile, the armed forces have fought with Al-Qaeda in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb or AQIM, an Islamist militant organization that aims to overthrow the Algerian government and institute an Islamic state. Buying the Su-57 reinforces the Algerian Air Force’s capabilities vis-à-vis Morocco, which has been approved to buy 25 new F-16 Block 72s, as well as an upgrade package to bring that country’s existing Viper fleet up to the very similar F-16V standard. At the same time, it further underlines Algeria’s defense ties with Russia. Four Moroccan F-16s sit on the runway prior to takeoff at Ben Guerir Air Base, Morocco, during Exercise African Lion 2021. U.S. Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Thomas S. Keisler IV Airman 1st Class Thomas Keisler It remains to be seen how many Su-57s Algeria will acquire and when they start to be delivered. But even a small number would be a shot in the arm for the Su-57 program, which has so far struggled to gain traction on the export market, not helped by the slow pace of the program and Russia’s reluctance to order it in more significant numbers.

C-17’s ‘Silver Bullet’ Airstream Trailer Pod Used By Secretary Of...	During his first overseas flight as Defense Secretary, Pete Hegseth shared a video of himself aboard a C-17 Globemaster III transport jet sitting in a Silver Bullet Command and Control Module. The converted Airstream trailer is one of two the Air Force deploys to give senior leaders like Hegseth and other VVIPs a secure, quiet place to conduct business in the middle of a noisy, often-crowded cargo aircraft. The Silver Bullets’ days are numbered though. For a host of reasons, a replacement unit called the Roll-On Conference Capsule (ROCC) is scheduled to be fielded in December, the Air Force told us today. Unlike the adapted Silver Bullets, which first flew in the early 1990s, these were purpose-built for the mission. The short video showed Hegseth sitting on a brown leather chair at a small workstation inside the Silver Bullet, where he signed an order changing the name of Fort Liberty in North Carolina to Fort Roland L. Bragg. It was during a long flight from Joint Base Andrews (JBA) in Maryland to Germany, where he visited U.S. Africa Command and U.S. European Command in Stuttgart on Tuesday before heading to Brussels to discuss the future of U.S. support for Ukraine with NATO allies. Bragg is back!

In addition to giving Hegseth a place to do his job as defense secretary, the Silver Bullet - at best a homey hideaway reminiscent of a 1990s motorhome - also offered him a place to rest. SECDEF Hegseth at his desk in the Silver Bullet. (DOD Screencap) Dick Cheney in the Silver Bullet at the same desk areas as Hegseth. (The U.S. National Archives) The Silver Bullet 'was certainly comfortable and provided a relatively quiet place to work and concentrate.' Joseph Votel, the retired Army general who commanded U.S. Central Command from 2016 to 2019, told The War Zone in a 2022 story about the modules. 'As a combatant commander, I had a need to stay in constant communications even during lengthy travel to the Middle East and do it in a place that I could work from. Purpose-designed aircraft and some other capabilities made available to us helped to make that possible — it was a multiplier for me. In the end – I just needed to be able to operate.'

(DOD photo) The Silver Bullet is essentially a mobile SCIF, office, and apartment all in one. An arsenal of communications tech has been continuously upgraded that works to connect the pod to the outside world. This includes multiple options for unsecure and secure voice, data, and video teleconferencing. These systems 'plug in' to the existing communications systems aboard a select number of C-17s via a set of umbilical cables. There is a large 'mechanical caboose' that brings up the rear of the palleted Silver Bullet system where the communications technology and controls that support the pod are held and where the pod’s electronics are interfaced with the C-17. The updated version of this enclosure is called the 'Silver Eagle' and it can support communications at the very highest levels. Above all else, this includes being able to connect with the National Command Authority which underpins America's nuclear deterrent, anywhere and anytime. A very rare view inside the 'Silver Eagle. (SelectTech) We reached out to the Pentagon to see how Hegseth liked the Silver Bullet, which like its twin is owned by Air Mobility Command and maintained by the 89th Maintenance Group at JBA. It was by chance, meanwhile, that Hegseth flew the Globemaster on his maiden voyage as SECDEF. He was scheduled to fly one of the four existing E-4B Survivable Airborne Operations Center jets. 'Occasionally, due to routine scheduled maintenance, the small fleet of four aircraft cannot support additional tasking such as SecDef travel. In such cases, it is not uncommon for the SecDef to be supported with an alternative type of aircraft,' Justin R. Oakes, spokesman for the Eighth Air Force and the Joint-Global Strike Operations Center told us earlier this week. In addition to better availability, the Globemasters have another advantage over the E-4Bs. They have a defensive suite includes multiple types of expendable decoys and the laser-based Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasure System (LAIRCM). This system uses staring missile launch detectors arrayed around the aircraft that alert the crew of an incoming missile via detection of the missile’s infrared plume and cue a number of laser turrets positioned around the jet’s fuselage to fire their blinding beams into the missile’s infrared seeker. This capability makes using the Silver Bullet a requirement for traveling into hostile locales. An Air Force E-4B flies over the Canadian Pacific Coast April 10, 2014. .

This shot gives us a good look at the E-4's spine, which is festooned with antennas. (U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Mary O'Dell) Regardless, Hegseth has only about 10 more months to use the Silver Bullets. They are scheduled to be retired and replaced by the newer, safer ROCCs. In 2019, the Air Force awarded an $8.5 million contract to SelectTech Services Corp. of Centerville, Ohio, for the design, development, integration, test and delivery of two ROCCs to replace the aging Airstream units. As we noted in our previous coverage, the Silver Bullets were considered so unsafe they were deemed not airworthy back in 2000. It wasn’t until 2020 that the flying branch issued a memo authorizing occupancy of the modules, except during takeoffs and landings, refueling and 'moderate turbulence in flight as determined by the aircraft commander,' Air Force officials told The War Zone. The Silver Bullets 'did not meet the numerous airworthiness requirements, including crash loads, egress, gusts loads, electrical system design, smoke and fumes, etc.,' the Air Force explained to us in 2022. In addition, a 2015 Air Force assessment 'identified numerous risks which were generally associated with substandard electrical system design, improper use of materials for an aircraft environment, and inadequate structural design integrity for crash scenarios, hard landings, and turbulence in flight.' The situation was of great enough concern that the House Armed Services Committee in its markup of the Fiscal Year 2023 National Defense Authorization Act asked the Air Force Secretary for a full report by March 2023 on the Silver Bullet’s problems and plan for replacement.

Hagel returned to Washington from his first visit to Afghanistan as Secretary of Defense on Monday. (AP Photo/Jason Reed, Pool) The ROCC is designed to mitigate those concerns, the Air Force told us. 'The intent is for [the ROCC] to be fully certified for all phases of flight when it is fielded,' Air Force Capt. Denise Guiao-Corpuz told us.' Those modules will have 'intercom systems, lavatories, Ethernet network, Wi-Fi, VTC system display, external voice and data connectivity (wideband or narrowband), 120V/60Hz outlets, sleeping quarters, and a 9-person conference room,' according to SelectTech. The new Roll-On Conference Capsule from SelecTech will replace the Silver Bullet.

(SelectTech graphic) The Silver Bullets have a storied past, hosting U.S. cabinet members, service secretaries, other military leaders, vice presidents, and even celebrities like Robin Williams and Drew Carey. Considering their significance, these unique but dated VVIP pods will hopefully find their way into museums.

Mystery Tiltrotor Aircraft Emerges	What looks to be a previously unseen vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) capable aircraft design with a mix of tilting and fixed rotors has emerged at the Mojave Air and Space Port in California. Mojave is a hotbed for aviation development where testing of new and often intriguing designs, including VTOL types, regularly occurs. Photographer Matt Hartman took the pictures seen above and below of the unusual aircraft at Mojave yesterday and posted them on social media. The aircraft was sitting outside a hangar on the eastern side of the main apron area, according to Hartman. Several aviation companies have a permanent presence at Mojave and the U.S. military also makes use of its facilities. and here the #EVTOL oddball of the week seen at MHV! No id or idea on this one… #avGeek #VTOL 02-10-25 pic.twitter.com/5oWXKnvWd4&mdash; Matt Hartman (@ShorealoneFilms) February 11, 2025 No identifying markings are readily visible on the aircraft and it is unpainted in its primer coating. It is also physically anchored to the ground and hoses are seen snaking down from the nacelles holding the rotors, all of which is common to see during ground testing of VTOL designs. Matt Hartman From what can otherwise be seen in Hartman's pictures, the design has six rotor assemblies. There are two larger ones in tilting nacelle pods at the wingtips and two pairs of smaller ones that appear to be fixed vertically in nacelles built into the high-mounted wing. A single horizontal trapezoidal tail points to a twin-boom tail configuration is also visible. Matt Hartman A closer look at the three rotor assemblies on the right wing. Matt Hartman There is a central fuselage with a front windscreen with two distinct halves, pointing to side-by-side seating, at least for individuals up front. A large doorway is also seen on the left side of the forward fuselage. A tricycle landing gear arrangement consisting of a nose wheel and two main wheels attached to struts sticking out from the sides of the rear of the fuselage is visible, as well. In some very broad respects, it almost looks like a mashup of the OV-10 Bronco light attack and observation aircraft and the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor. An ever closer look at the front of the mystery VTOL aircraft. Matt Hartman Though what kind of propulsion system the design might have is unknown, the wingtip nacelle pods at least have exhausts pointing to turbine engines, which could drive the rotors directly or produce electricity to run electric motors that drive these rotors. They could also drive the wing rotor via mechanical linkages or by providing electronic power to their motors. Additional turbines might also be present in the wing nacelles to provide power to those rotors, either mechanically or electrically, but they would have to be small and this seems less likely to be the case. A hybrid-electric design where turbines provide electricity to at least some of the rotors would be a particularly big deal as this is still an emerging technology space, especially for the U.S. military, if it is involved with this design at all. The market space for hybrid and electric VTOL designs, crewed and uncrewed, and intended for civilian and/or military use, has exploded in recent years in the United States and globally. In April 2024, the independent Vertical Flight Society said its database of distinct electric VTOL, or eVTOL, concepts had hit 1,000 entries. Many such designs have been tested at Mojave. The Air Force's Agility Prime program, which began in 2020, is perhaps the best-known example of recent U.S. military efforts in this space. Run through AFWERX, the service's internal technology incubator, Agility Prime has been experimenting with a variety of eVTOL designs, including types from Beta Technologies, Joby Aviation, and LIFT Aircraft. In December, Aviation Week reported that persistent range limitations with existing eVTOL designs had prompted Agility Prime to refocus its efforts on hybrid-electric types. For the U.S. military, interest in new VTOL aircraft designs, including the active development of types with more traditional propulsion arrangements, is being driven in part by a desire for greater runway independence amid concerns about the growing vulnerability of air bases, as well as other established facilities, during a future high-end conflict. This, in turn, has led to the development of new concepts of operations focused heavily on expeditionary and distributed operations, including in remote and austere sites with limited existing infrastructure. New VTOL designs, especially uncrewed ones, are also increasingly viewed as important components of future supply chains for forces in forward areas, including right on the front lines. Casualty evacuation and the extraction of downed pilots, including from behind enemy lines, have also been presented as potential roles for such aircraft. There is also considerable civilian interest in hybrid-powered and eVTOL designs, including from commercial operators eyeing them for use as air taxis. While we don't know if the aircraft that has now emerged at Mojave is intended for civilian or military use, or both, it does appear to be quite elaborate overall. Larger tilt-rotor designs also remain rare among civilian-focused general mobility concepts. TWZ will be keeping an eye out for more information about this VTOL aircraft and what its projected roles might be.

Russian Military Convoy Blocked From Entering Port Of Tartus In S...	A Russian military convoy was reportedly prevented from entering Tartus naval base in Syria. This is the latest indication of estrangement between the two erstwhile allies. The move came amid the ongoing withdrawal of Russian forces from Tartus in the wake of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham’s (HTS) sudden overthrow of dictator Bashar Al Assad late last year. 'The Syrian Defense Ministry has prevented a Russian military convoy from entering the Tartus base,' the Turkish TRT media outlet reported on Tuesday. 'A column of 30 missile-armed vehicles that set out in the morning from the Khmeimim airbase in Latakia province was stopped at a checkpoint in Tartus by troops subordinate to the new Syrian government. After waiting at the checkpoint for eight hours, the convoy was forced to return to the Khmeimim base at around 5 p.m. local time.' Video emerging on social media showed Syrian forces ordering the convoy to turn around and head back to Khmeimim. The trucks appear to be caring missiles in their launch tubes. Syrian Arab Army blocked a Russian military convoy of around 35 military vehicles loaded with air defense missiles and various weapons from entering the city of #Tartus this evening, and the convoy was forced to turn back towards the Hmeimim base in the countryside of Latakia. pic.twitter.com/KBzT1GFabg&mdash; Mete Sohtaoğlu (@metesohtaoglu) February 11, 2025 Russians have frequently traveled this route to move equipment and supplies from Khmeimim, their master airbase in Syria, to Tartus, where they had a major naval facility prior to the fall of Assad, and vice versa, as you can see in the following videos.

However, TRT noted that it took place 'amid recent statements by the Defense Minister of the transitional government of Syria, Murhaf Abu Kasra, that the preservation of Russian bases would depend on their benefits for Syria.' 'If we benefit from this for Syria, then yes,' the Russians could remain there, Abu Kasra was quoted as saying. Negotiations between Moscow and Damascus over the future of Russian bases in Syria 'are almost certainly ongoing,' according to an assessment yesterday by the U.K.’s Defense Intelligence. 'Russia almost certainly continues to actively engage HTS to develop ties and promote itself as a beneficial partner,' the assessment suggested. 'However, Russia's negotiating position is weaker due to various factors, including, probably, the Syrian leadership's hostile attitude towards former Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, who is now being sheltered by Russia.' Latest Defence intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 10 February 2025.Find out more about Defence Intelligence's use of language: #StandWithUkraine pic.twitter.com/OxmN2jHVw9&mdash; Ministry of Defence (@DefenceHQ) February 10, 2025 Despite continuing its withdrawal from Syria, Russia still has a keen interest in maintaining a presence there. Having a port and air base on the Mediterranean gives it the ability to project tactical and strategic power into NATO's backyard, as well as into Africa and deeper into the Middle East. Syria, meanwhile, could possibly benefit from the return of Russia’s advanced air defense systems to the country helping to protect its skies. Adding to the complexity of this issue, Turkey, which backed HTS’ surprise overthrow of Assad, also wants to further assert its influence over Syria. Turkish journalist Mete Sohtaoğlu told us that no deal has yet been reached between Moscow and Damascus in part due to pressure from Ankara. The recent activity in and around Tartus also follows reports from Syrian media that the country’s fledgling government in Damascus canceled Russia’s 49-year lease agreement for its base in Tartus. The Kremlin had struck the deal back in 2017 with the Assad regime, which had essentially gifted the naval facility, as well as Khmeimim Air Base, to the Russians. Two years earlier, Russia’s military launched an intervention in the country, which had saved Assad from advancing rebel forces. Russian forces were still actively fighting rebel forces, including elements of the coalition led by HTS that ultimately deposed Assad, right up until the collapse of the regime. The port of Tartus in Syria is strategically located along the Mediterranean Sea and near Africa. (Google Earth) As part of the Russian withdrawal from Tartus, two Russian-flagged roll-on/roll-off (RO/RO) cargo ships - Sparta and Sparta II - were loaded with equipment. They transited the Strait of Gibraltar and are both currently located off the coast of Spain yesterday, according to the MarineTraffic.com vessel tracking website. Sparta is bound for St. Petersburg, according to MarineTraffic.com while Sparta II is headed for the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. As we previously reported, satellite imagery taken on Jan. 25 that TWZ obtained from Maxar, showed those RO/ROs docked in Tartus amid cargo loading activity. The two ships had been holding offshore for days before finally being allowed to enter the port. A satellite image taken on Jan. 25, 2025, showed Sparta and Sparta II docked in Syria’s port of Tartus. (Satellite image ©2025 Maxar Technologies) The images also showed the disappearance of a significant number of Russian vehicles and other materiel from a pier where they had been marshaled weeks ago. You can read more about that in our initial report here. A look at a section of one of the piers at Tartus where Russian assets had been had been marshaled weeks ago showing the disappearance of various vehicles and other materiel. (Satellite image ©2025 Maxar Technologies) It remains to be seen whether Syria will allow Russia to remain at Tartus and Khmeimim. Being able to turn around an armed convoy from Tartus highlights that Damascus has the upper hand in any negotiations over the future of those two facilities.

Tankers Flood Airspace Off The California Coast For China-Focused...	At least 20 U.S. Air Force tanker aircraft, 10 KC-46s and an equal number of KC-135s, supported the first day of the latest Bamboo Eagle exercise off the California Coast, according to online flight tracking data. The first Bamboo Eagle occurred last year, as you can learn more about in this past TWZ feature. The large force exercise series has quickly become one of the most important for the U.S. military, as well as key allies, and has a clear eye on preparing for a future coalition fight in the Pacific with China. A stock picture of a US Air Force KC-46 tanker. USAF The U.S. Air Force announced the start of Bamboo Eagle 25-1 yesterday. Like all previous iterations, the U.S. Air Force Warfare Center (USAFWC) at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada has been leading the exercise, but units spread across many other bases, predominantly in California, are also participating. U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy units are known to be taking part, but other branches have also been included in past iterations of Bamboo Eagle. Britain's Royal Air Force (RAF) and the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) have also returned and the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) has joined the exercise for the first time.

However, Rivet Joints have been recently tracked flying over the Pacific off southern California, as well as elsewhere in the southwestern United States, as part of a surge of U.S. military support to border security operations opposite Mexico. Not visible in the online flight tracking data from yesterday or today are the huge numbers of tactical jets that the tankers and other supporting aircraft were working with. In its announcement about the start of Bamboo Eagle 25-1, the Air Force included pictures of Air Force F-35A and RAF Typhoon FGR4 fighters, as well as Navy EA-18G Growler electronic warfare jets, taking part in Red Flag 25-1 at Nellis. Red Flag is the U.S. Air Force’s premier air combat exercise series and recent iterations have been increasingly focused on operations in the Pacific. This in turn has put new emphasis on the range complexes off the coast of southern California, which offer larger areas in which to train on physically broader and otherwise more complex scenarios, and do so over water. Red Flag is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year and the RAF and RAAF, among other key allies, are often participants. Other aircraft, including Air Force F-15E Strike Eagles and B-2 Spirit stealth bombers, as well as RAAF Growlers, took part in Red Flag 25-1, which flowed directly into Bamboo Eagle 25-1.

USAF An RAAF EA-18G taking part in Red Flag 25-1. USAF Senior Airman Makenna Patterson 'This is the largest number of aircraft we’ve deployed for an exercise at Nellis (AFB) since we first attended Red Flag in 1980,' RAAF Group Captain Stewart Seeney said in a statement yesterday. 'These exercises provide a realistic training environment where we can integrate different capabilities and develop our ability to work with key allies and partners. For many of our aviators, deploying on these exercises is a career highlight and is not an experience that can be easily replicated elsewhere.' F-35As from Hill Air Force Base in Utah are also notably operating from Naval Air Station North Island in California as part of the exercise. The Navy facility has been used as a staging point in past iterations of Bamboo Eagle. Air Force units using it for this purpose also have the opportunity to train around still-evolving rapid deployment and related concepts of operations, currently referred to collectively as Agile Combat Employment (ACE), which the service has been working on for years now. ACE has been and continues to be a central focus for Bamboo Eagle exercises, in general. A US Air Force F-35A assigned to the 388th Fighter Wing at Hill Air Force Base at Naval Air Station North Island taking part in Bamboo Eagle 25-1. USAF Micah Garbarino 'We have had the luxury of operating from safe haven bases for many decades, and modern threats have fundamentally changed that reality,' Air Force Maj. Gen. Christopher Niemi, head of USAFWC also said in a statement. 'Bamboo Eagle is a big part of helping us figure out how to manage those threats, and training together with our allies improves our ability to face those threats as a unified team.' Other branches of the U.S. military, especially the U.S. Marine Corps, have been developing similar concepts of operations all centered heavily on ways to quickly deploy and redeploy forces throughout forward areas to upend enemy targeting cycles. Concerns about access to established bases, especially in the context of a potential future high-end fight in the Pacific, have been particular drivers of these efforts. There are growing calls for the U.S. military to do more to physically harden bases in the Pacific, along with other defensive improvements, which you can read more about here.

USAF The prospect of a major conflict with China in the Pacific, where bases on the ground may be few and far between, has also been contributing to concerns about overall aerial refueling capacity, as well as the vulnerability of existing tankers. What has been seen from Bamboo Eagle 25-1 already underscores the critical importance of aerial refueling, especially for supporting shorter-legged tactical jets. The Air Force is in the process of refining requirements for new stealth tankers and has also been exploring more novel options for increasing aerial refueling capacity. The Navy and Marine Corps, which have the added planning consideration of expeditionary aviation operations from carriers and other big deck ships, are also acutely aware of the issues at play. The Navy is planning to add MQ-25 Stingray drone tankers to its carrier air wings in the coming years and there is also interest in new options for extending the ranges of existing tactical jets. Private contractors, which can provide aerial refueling support for non-combat missions and help free up organic U.S. military tankers in the process, are another steadily growing part of the equation. There is significant uncertainty around future defense spending plans under President Donald Trump's new administration, especially when it comes to Air Force modernization priorities like stealth tankers and other next-generation aircraft that were already facing affordability concerns.

Lockheed Martin Skunk Works Bamboo Eagle 25-1 also comes ahead of Air Force plans to stage a massive air combat exercise across reperetantive operating areas in the Pacific this summer, which you can read more about here. Dubbed REFORPAC, the exercise is expected to last some two weeks, days of which will be spent just getting forces to and from operating locations, underscoring the basic geographical challenges the region presents. At least some units taking part in REFORPAC are expected to go almost straight from that exercise into another iteration of Bamboo Eagle, as well. A map Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Allvin shared together with the details about the REFORPAC exercise during a talk at the Hudson Institute in 2024.

Navy Growler’s Next-Generation Jamming Pod Went To War On Its Fir...	The Navy’s new AN/ALQ-249(V)1 Next Generation Jammer-Mid Band (NGJ-MB) electronic warfare pods have completed their maiden deployment with an E/A-18G Growler squadron. The pods went on cruise with Electronic Attack Squadron 133 (VAQ-133) to the highly tumulteous Red Sea and Gulf of Aden with the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group (CSG) last year, with the carrier returning home in time for the holidays. TWZ spoke this month with two of the top officers involved in the NGJ-MB effort to get a sense of how the pods performed, what’s next for the system and the decision-making process behind fielding the ALQ-249 last year, even as formal Pentagon testing and evaluation remained incomplete. Details about the ALQ-249 pod’s capabilities remain limited. Cmdr. Erik Dente, VAQ-133’s commanding officer, declined to comment on precisely how the NGJ-MB pods performed on deployment, or the target sets they took on against the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen.

(U.S. Navy) Capt. David Rueter, program manager for airborne electronic attack systems at Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), also declined to talk specifics, but he noted how the ALQ-249 represents 'a quantum leap in where we are with airborne electronic attack.' 'They performed as expected, or maybe even a little better than I expected,' Rueter said of the ALQ-249 pods. 'When you’re developing a program, you have an idea how you think it’s going to be employed, between hangar bay, flight deck, cyclic ops, that kind of stuff. And then what actually happens is probably not the exact scenario you plan for.' Rueter added that his team will be traveling to the squadron this week to get more feedback on how the NGJ performed. Dente called the transition to the new pods 'pretty seamless.' The AN/ALQ-249 Next Generation Jammer is seen under the outer wing of an E/A-18G Growler. (U.S. Navy) 'I won’t get into specifics about pod performance,' he said. 'I will say it’s always a challenging thing about a brand new system … Those challenges, to me, largely spoke to what that system is capable of.' While the Navy has remained mum about what precisely the ALQ-240 can do, manufacturer Raytheon describes the NGJ-MB as 'an advanced electronic attack system that denies, disrupts and degrades enemy technology, including communication tools and air-defense systems.' Its capabilities include 'operating at significantly enhanced ranges' and 'attacking multiple targets simultaneously.' The Navy's AN/ALQ-249 Next Generation Jammer. (Raytheon) They are replacing the legacy AN/ALQ-99 pods, which first entered service in the early 1970s and have received upgrades since then, even as officials concede that upgrade capacity on the ‘-99s’ is running out. 'We realized years ago that we've kind of maxed out the ALQ-99 form factor,' Rueter said. 'So next gen jammer really brings us up into modern and evolving threats. So much more modern architecture, more capacity than ALQ-99, more power and certainly more capability.' ALQ-249 pods are designed to improve EA-18G capabilities against modern, advanced radiofrequency (RF) threats — namely air defenses — as well as communications, datalinks, and non-traditional RF targets. The pods also offer the Navy a new way 'to deny, degrade, or deceive the enemy’s use of the electromagnetic spectrum by employing both reactive and preemptive jamming techniques while enhancing the friendly force’s use of the electromagnetic spectrum,' a Pentagon report assessing the capability states. You can read our assessment of how the new pods could provide additional capabilities here. The AN/ALQ-99 pod. (Hunini via Wikicommons) The NGJ-MB’s use of multiple active electronically scanned arrays (AESA), something not found on the older ALQ-99s jammers, as well as its modular open architecture design, could open the door to a variety of new and improved capabilities. General configuration of the NGJ-MB pod, with its ram-air power generator and two AESAs on each end. (U.S. Navy) During past U.S. operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, it emerged that Growlers, as well as the EA-6B Prowlers they replaced, had been using their electronic warfare suites to prevent militants from remotely detonating improvised explosive devices. The bottom line is that these new pods have capabilities we do not know anything about and the tactics behind their use are rapidly evolving. Marines and their EA-6B Prowler jets at al-Udeid Air Base, Qatar, in 2018, before the air frame's retirement. (U.S. Navy) As its name indicates, the NGJ-MB pods are only designed to work in certain frequency bands. L3 Harris has been developing an entirely separate NGJ-Low Band (NGJ-LB) pod to complement the mid-band ones. There are also high and low-band versions of the ALQ-99, and Rueter told TWZ that the service’s priorities for next-generation jammers are midband first, then low band and eventually high band. 'I'll say high band is still on the to do list, but it's prioritized appropriately, and we'll get to it eventually,' he said. A US Navy briefing slide outlining the service’s plans for the Next-Generation Jammer program as a whole. (U.S. Navy) While VAQ-133 was the first unit to deploy with the pods, Rueter said an initial ship set was sent to them at the onset of their pre-deployment workups, to get the air crew familiar with the new system. 'We really tried hard to get their air crew and their maintainers trained, and give them at least one ship set from the very beginning,' he said. 'So they were actually flying with NGJ mid band for a little under a year before they actually deployed.' Nothing much changed on the pre-deployment workups side with the arrival of the NGJ-MB, Dente said, it was just new technology to incorporate. The new jammer pods are loaded and offloaded onto the Growler depending on mission requirements, and Dente said his squadron noted very little change when it came to handling and operating the AN/ALQ-249, although incorporating the new tech into the unit and getting everyone trained up on the system before deployment took some time. 'How we operated is largely similar,' he said. 'There’s just some differences in basic admin of the pod, turning it on and off, those things are a little bit different, but generally speaking, employment and operation is similar.' Because the new jammers pods were still going through operational testing, Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 9 (VX-9) designated VAQ-133 as 'adjunct testers' as they began fielding the AN/ALQ-249, Rueter said. 'So 133 was able to do that, and VX-9 was able to leverage any data from 133 to help augment operational tests,' he said. Sending the NGJ-MB out into the fleet provided invaluable feedback to the Navy regarding how the new pods hold up to the stressors of a combat deployment, Rueter added. 'It’s just the pure number of flight hours,' he said. 'We put a lot of hours on in test, but we cannot do what the fleet does. The fleet probably puts more hours on in a month than we do in a year in developmental and operational test.'

(U.S. Navy) Deploying the NGJ-MB aboard a flattop in a combat environment for the first time presented its own unique challenges, according to VAQ-133 CO Dente. 'Saltwater environment, being out to sea, how do these things live on an aircraft carrier with us?' he said. 'It takes adaptation … because not only do we have to worry about the safety challenges that are always presented by new equipment being stored on an aircraft carrier, but we also have to learn how to keep the system itself safe from bumps, bruises, scuffs and normal day-to-day hazards that operations on an aircraft carrier present.' Sailors remove chocks and chains from an EA-18G Growler armed with NGJ pods. (U.S. Navy) While ALQ-249 now has its first deployment under its belt, the latest Director, Operational Test & Evaluation (DOT&E) Pentagon report released this month highlighted challenges the service has faced with ALQ-249 development in the past year. 'Technical challenges were significant during the course of all testing in FY24,' the report states. 'Specifically, reliability has been a clear challenge during the course of the program development, to the point of affecting suitability and the ability to assess the performance of the system overall. Early reliability issues were predominantly hardware related, but after further development and implementation of fixes, the remaining issues appear to be mostly software centric. Although data are still insufficient to fully assess the reliability of the system, data trends have been markedly improving, suggesting the potential for a strong positive reversal in the future.' Rueter called the DOT&E assessment 'fair,' and said that previous development programs have followed such a progression. 'The hardware failures, or the hardware things, kind of mask the software,' he said. 'So the first thing you do is get the hardware reliable, then you start working on the software. And like [DOT&E] said, we have seen great improvements in our reliability over the last year.' EA-18G Growlers attached to Electronic Attack Squadron (VAQ) 133, arrive home to Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Washington, in December. (U.S. Navy) The decision-making calculus remains unclear regarding the Navy choosing to deploy the new jammer pods despite this initial testing and evaluation not being completed. Naval Air Forces officials did not answer TWZ questions about the decision to send the capability into the hectic skies over the Red Sea, where the Navy has battled Iran-backed Houthi rebel missile and drone barrages for more than a year. Rueter deferred questions about sending the pods out with VAQ-133 to the fleet, but noted how the squadron got their first pod set during pre-deployment workups and chose which pods to affix to the jet depending on the mission. Growlers can carry both at the same time. 'The midband pods are carried on the wings, and then the ALQ-99 are on centerline,' he said. Sending a system out for some real-world application before testing is completed is 'happening more and more,' Rueter said. As TWZ previously reported, the latest DOT&E report also showcased how the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier undertook its first full deployment in 2023, even as multiple systems aboard that first-in-class flattop had yet to be fully assessed. 'I won’t speculate as to why it’s happening more and more, but yeah, I think we are seeing more and more systems that are fielded by the services before all initial operational tests are complete,' Rueter said. 'I think the days of having a large, dedicated [Initial Operational Test & Evaluation (IOT&E)] period, that we wait until that whole period is done, those days are probably behind us, and we need to get a much more agile, continuous operational test cycle.' While not a program office function, Rueter said the squadron’s air crew was calling back to stateside testers for technical questions as they planned different operations. Another unidentified Growler squadron has also received the new jammer. Under an existing agreement, the Royal Australian Air Force’s (RAAF) No. 6 Squadron is also slated to get the NGJ 'in the near future,' he said. A Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) E/A-18G Growler. (RAAF) 'They’ve already completed maintenance and air crew training, and they’re getting ready to accept the ship set,' he said. 'The program now, one part of it is production and fielding, along with, we’ve got a continual improvement development program.' Rueter wants to get the NGJ to a point where the Navy can send out four software updates a year, to keep the system more reliable, add new capabilities and mitigate software anomalies that pop up. 'I tell the team here, look at ALQ-99, it’s been flying for 50-plus years,' he said. 'You need to have the mindset that ALQ-249 is going to fly for 50 years, and you’re going to continually upgrade it so we can continue to pace and stay ahead of the threat.' Meanwhile, Rueter said his team is looking hard at getting electronic warfare to a place where systems leverage 'cognitive electronic warfare' and can be updated in real time, or close to it. 'I can't talk about specific systems or anything, but I'll say, as an electronic warfare practitioner for going on 27 years now, I think that is definitely one of the areas we need to move in,' he said. 'Artificial intelligence and machine learning brings a lot of capabilities that we haven't really had access to before, and one of our charges here in the program office is to figure out what do they bring that we didn't have before, and how can we use that to give the fleet better tools.' A VAQ-133 Growler assigned to the USS Abraham Lincoln with the AN/ALQ-249 Next Generation Jammer-Mid Band (NGJ-MB) pods under its wings. (U.S. Navy) Since the Air Force retired the EF-111A in 1998, the Navy has been the only disclosed operator of dedicated fast-jet tactical electronic warfare capability within the U.S. military, and is therefore tasked with providing such support across the branches. Rueter said he welcomes any collaboration with other platforms or services that helps him put the 'fog' into the fog of war when it comes to airborne electronic attack (AEA). 'While a majority of the systems we work on fly on a Growler today, I want to be the center of excellence, if you will, for all offensive electronic attack,' he said. 'Another platform, whether it's an [unmanned aerial drone], whether it's a different manned aircraft, whether it's a surface vessel, I'd like to think if they want to project some sort of electronic attack effect, they could come to us. We've already got a long lineage of people developing jammer techniques. Other people might refer to them as electronic warfare skills. So we've got a lot of experience and are happy to build payloads for whoever wants to do AEA.' The NGJ has now deployed, contributed to combat operations and returned home. Meanwhile, the importance of such capabilities will only continue to grow in a warscape that places an increasingly imperative on dominating the electronic spectrum.

French Fighters Downed 'Nearly A Dozen Drones' In Red Sea Combat	French Air and Space Force Mirage 2000-5F and Rafale fighters shot down 'nearly a dozen drones' in recent combat operations over and around the Red Sea, the head of that service has confirmed. The announcement comes soon after the first French-supplied Mirage 2000-5Fs arrived in Ukraine, where they will be expected to face similar threats, in the form of Russian-operated long-range one-way attack drones. 'In the Air and Space Force, both the Mirage 2000-5 and the Rafale recently demonstrated their effectiveness against Shahed-type suicide drones, against which Ukrainian pilots will have to fight,' Jérôme Bellanger, the Chief of Staff of the French Air and Space Force wrote on LinkedIn yesterday.

Photo by DAPHNE BENOIT/AFP via Getty Images DAPHNE BENOIT Bellanger continued: 'I salute our combat crews engaged in operations, who recently destroyed nearly a dozen drones, notably in the Red Sea. The quality of our weapons systems and the expertise of our crews have once again demonstrated their operational effectiveness.' Bellanger also posted a brief video from the head-up display of a French Rafale, showing the close-range interception and engagement of a Houthi drone using an air-to-air missile. (Note that in the caption for the video below, the fighter is misidentified as a Mirage 2000, but the electro-optical sensor characteristic to the Rafale is visible when illuminated by the missile’s motor). The exact total of Houthi drones that were downed by the French fighters was not disclosed and TWZ has approached the French Ministry of Defense for more details, including the dates of these incidents. The French Air and Space Force has a permanent detachment of Mirage 2000-5F fighters in Djibouti, on the Horn of Africa, from where they would be ideally positioned to intercept drones over the Red Sea. Meanwhile, Rafales have been deployed on a rotational basis at Prince Hassan Air Base in Jordan, as well as at Al Dhafra in the United Arab Emirates, both of these primarily in support of Operation Chammal, the French contribution to the anti-ISIS mission in Iraq and Syria.

Both fighters also have cannon armament, with the Mirage having a pair of 30mm DEFA weapons and the Rafale being armed with a single GIAT weapon of the same caliber. The Iranian-backed Houthis began launching drone, missile, and other attacks against foreign warships and commercial vessels in and around the Red Sea, as well as targets in Israel, in October 2023, and fighters from various nations have been prominently involved in tackling some of these threats. The fact that French fighters had been involved in shooting down Houthi drones over and around the Red Sea had been disclosed before, although the French Ministry of Defense provided very few details.

Aaron Irvin During a large-scale Houthi attack on ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden on March 9, 2024, the French Armed Forces stated that one of its warships and undisclosed French fighters shot down four combat drones that were advancing toward naval vessels belonging to the European Aspides mission in the region. A video showing the French Navy Aquitaine class frigate Lorraine during a Red Sea deployment last year: The drones presented 'an imminent threat to merchant vessels, U.S. Navy, and coalition ships in the region,' the French Ministry of Defense said in a post on social media platform X. Later the same month, the French Armed Forces released a video showing the downing of a Houthi drone over the Red Sea by a French Navy helicopter, using machine gun fire. 'On March 20, while conducting close protection under EUNAVFOR Aspides in the Red Sea, the embarked helicopter of a French destroyer shot down a Houthi UAV threatening the commercial navigation,' the official Aspides account said on X.

For a time, France was part of the international, U.S.-led task force Operation Prosperity Guardian (OPG), launched in that same month to combat the threat of Houthi missiles and drones on commercial shipping. France subsequently said it would not operate under U.S. command, amid possible strains in the relationship, as we reported previously. Since then, France has conducted its mission in the region as part of the Aspides task force. Unlike OPG, Aspides was set up as a purely defensive task force. Returning to fighters being used to counter Houthi drones, TWZ recently broke the news that U.S. Air Force F-16s have been using 70mm laser-guided rockets to down these during operations in and around the Red Sea in the past year. This involves the Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II (APKWS II) rockets, originally developed to engage targets on the ground, but now also employed as lower-cost, more numerous air-to-air weapons. So far, officials have not confirmed how many of the rockets have been used in this manner, how many Houthi drones have been shot down as a result, or when this capability was first used in combat. A pair of U.S. Air Force F-16Cs on patrol somewhere in the Middle East on January 25, 2025. The jet seen at the rear is armed with a 70mm rocket pod, as well as other weapons. U.S. Air Force The extent of the Houthis’ mass drone and missile attacks has, on occasion, seen fighters having to land to reload with missiles while threats were still flying overhead. With primary air-to-air weapons being rapidly expended, the crew of at least one U.S. Air Force F-15E was forced to switch to guns after running out of missiles but did not succeed in downing any targets. For the French Mirage 2000-5F, the combat employment against the Houthi drone threat has provided something of a proving ground for the next stage of the type’s career in Ukraine. As you can read about here, the first Mirage 2000-5Fs, taken from French stocks, arrived in Ukraine last week. The delta-winged jet is the second Western-made fighter type for Ukraine, following the arrival of the F-16, the first of which arrived in Ukraine last summer.

The Mirage 2000 can take off in a relatively short distance and has a very impressive rate of climb, as well as a top speed of Mach 1.6 even when carrying missiles and a fuel tank. With a single external fuel tank, the Mirage 2000-5F can also patrol for 1 hour and 45 minutes, provided use of the afterburner is limited. With these qualities in mind, it’s expected that the fighters will help contribute to the protection of Ukrainian cities and infrastructure against Russian drone and cruise missile attacks. In these missions, they will face Iranian-designed Shahed long-range one-way attack drones and derivatives, very similar to at least some of the drones that have been used by the Houthis. A Russian-operated Shahed drone that was brought down or crashed in Ukraine. via X Via Twitter 'The Ukrainian Air Force has new, combat-proven capabilities to carry out this air combat,' Bellanger, the Chief of Staff of the French Air and Space Force, commented, in relation to the Mirage 2000-5F transfer. While the Mirage 2000-5F continues to complement the Rafale with the French Air and Space Force and appears to have found something of a niche for itself intercepting drones in the Red Sea region, we surely won’t have to wait too long for the first reports of the venerable fighter flying combat missions with the Ukrainian Air Force, too.

The Last Mars Flying Boat Just Made Its Final Flight	The last of the Martin Mars flying boats just made its final landing, arriving in Arizona, where its eternal resting place will be the Pima Air and Space Museum (PASM). It took off earlier today from San Francisco and touched down in Lake Pleasant, Arizona. From there the iconic aircraft will be partially disessmbled and trucked to PASM for display. It will be one of more than 400 aircraft calling the 80-acre PASM museum home. Originally developed for the U.S. Navy as a maritime patrol bomber and later reconfigured as a transport ferrying supplies between Hawaii and the Pacific Islands, the Mars family of flying boats found their niche as firefighting water bombers. Philippine Mars landed in San Francisco on Sunday, making a pit stop on its way to its final destination after leaving its lakeside home in Vancouver, British Columbia. The flying boat was moored alongside the USS Hornet overnight in San Francisco Bay. The retired aircraft carrier now converted into a museum. Always a beautiful day on the USS Hornet!

(FlightRadar screencap) In 2007 Coulson Aircrane Ltd. purchased Philippine Mars and its sister aircraft, Hawaii Mars 'to expand its firefighting capabilities, establishing itself as the only operator at the time operating both fixed wing and rotary wing firefighting aircraft,' according to the company. The Martin Mars flying boats were unique aircraft. With a wingspan of 200 feet and a length of more than 117 feet, the Mars — in its ultimate configuration — tipped the scales at 165,000 pounds at its maximum takeoff weight. It was powered by four Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone radial engines, each producing 2,500 horsepower. A three-view line drawing of the Martin JRM-1 Mars, from the Bureau of Aeronautics, Navy Department, dated August 1948. (Public Domain) There were seven Martin Mars flying boats, all produced between 1942 and 1947, according to Coulson. 'The surviving fleet of four aircraft were sold in 1958 to a consortium of timber companies in British Columbia, Canada, and converted into the world’s largest waterbombers carrying 7,200 U.S. gallons per drop,' according to Vintage Aviation News. 'The Mars fleet flew cargo between Hawaii and the Pacific Islands to support the U.S. Navy during World War II,' the company explained. 'After the war, they supported the Korean War with medical air transport lifts between Hawaii and California, later transitioning to cargo lift work between Hawaii and California before being decommissioned in 1956.'

(USN) The surviving fleet of four aircraft was sold in 1958 'to a consortium of timber companies in British Columbia, Canada, and converted into the world’s largest waterbombers carrying 7,200 U.S. gallons per drop.' Coulson purchased two of the aircraft, the Hawaii Mars and the Philippine Mars, in 2007, which marked the beginning of the company’s fixed-wing air tanker operations for aerial wildfire support. The Mars water bombers 'served the Province of British Columbia from 1960-2015 and over the span of 55 years dropped over 50 million gallons each which is more water on fires than any other single firefighting aircraft in history anywhere in the world.' The aircraft were put up for sale nearly a decade ago, but nobody bought them. Eventually, they were fully retired as the cost to fly and maintain them grew. A deal was later worked out to send Philippine Mars to PASM. As we previously reported earlier this year, its sister ship, Hawaii Mars, made a two-hour flight to its new home at the B.C. Aviation Museum in Sidney on Vancouver Island. Now that Philippine Mars has arrived in Arizona, there will be no more majestic Mars flying boats to ever grace the skies again, marking the end of an aviation era.

The Ukrainian Air Force has shared some rare views of S-300V1 surface-to-air missile systems firing their 26-foot-long 9M83 interceptors. Early in the conflict, the Soviet-era S-300V1 was one of the highest-end air defense systems available to Ukraine's armed forces, and one of the few offering critical anti-ballistic missile capability, but it's unclear how many of them are still in service. Two different clips of S-300V1s firing, as well as other footage of the system in use, were included in a video montage that Ukraine's Air Force recently released. In the Ukrainian armed forces, the Air Force is the service primarily in charge of higher-end ground-based air and missile defense. And another S-300V engagement, released as part of the same video.From what I have seen, these are the third and fourth Ukrainian S-300V engagement videos released since the start of the war. pic.twitter.com/wPHnYbCQKP&mdash; OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) February 9, 2025 Should note: first tweet includes a small error on my end, it’s a 9A85 TEL firing a 9M83 interceptor, not a 9M82. pic.twitter.com/HiMU2blgh0&mdash; OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) February 9, 2025 Despite the shared nomenclature, the S-300V series is completely different from the S-300P series variants developed by the Soviet Union and then by Russia. Versions of the S-300V include self-contained tracked transport-erector-launcher and radar (TELAR) vehicles. There are also TELs without the radar, but that also feature a crane and can be used to reload other launchers. Offboard radars can also be used with the system.

George Chernilevsky via Wikicommons (Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license) Two different interceptors exist for the S-300V series, the 9M82 and 9M83, referred to by NATO as the SA-12B Giant and SA-12A Gladiator, respectively. The 9M83 has a maximum engagement range under optimal conditions of about 47 miles. The larger 9M82, which is nearly 33 feet long and that Ukraine is now known to possess, has a reach of up to 60 miles. S-300V TELARs and TELs can, depending on subvariant, be loaded with up to two 9M82s or four 9M83s. Both interceptors have the ability to engage ballistic missiles in the terminal phase of their flight under limited circumstances. S-300V1 TELARs on parade in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv in 2018. VoidWanderer via Wikimedia (Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International license) 9M82s and 9M83s are so-called cold-launched missiles that are forcefully ejected vertically from their tubes first before their main rocket motor kicks in, making launches particularly dramatic, as can be seen in the recently released clips. As noted earlier the S-300V1 was an important air defense capability for Ukraine at the time of Russia's all-invasion in 2022. The tracked TELARs also gave the system valuable mobility that could be used to set up these powerful systems near the front lines and relatively. quickly relocate as required. However, it is not clear how many S-300V1s many may still be available. The Soviet-era systems were reportedly pulled out of storage and refurbished following Russia's illegal annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014. As TWZ has highlighted in the past, the global S-300V operator base has always been small and the only source for new production missiles has been the original manufacturer in Russia. As such, even if Ukraine still has a significant number of V1s that are still functional, stocks of interceptors for them can only have been dwindling in the past three years.

Marcus Yam / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images In fact, the video the Ukrainian Air Force recently released showing the S-300V1s in action is centered on an interview with an air defense officer, identified only as Dennis, who was originally trained on the system, but has since transitioned to the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS). Developed by defense contractors in the United States and Norway, NASAMS can fire AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles, AIM-9X Sidewinders, and IRIS-T missiles. NASAMS has been a major boon for Ukraine, and in no small part because of the many sources of missiles for it to fire, but it is not intended for use against incoming ballistic missiles.

Patriots can be and have been used by Ukrainian forces against non-ballistic targets, as well. Just in January, Israel reportedly began sending additional stocks of PAC-2 interceptors to Ukraine following its retirement of its Patriot systems last year.

Defense Industry of Ukraine Russia's ballistic missile arsenal, now bolstered by imports from North Korea, remains a serious threat to Ukraine and could grow further if much-reported deliveries of additional examples from Iran materialize. Though aging and increasingly difficult to support, any S-300V1s that remain operational in Ukraine would offer a still valuable mix of capabilities.

China’s J-20 Fighter Is Now Flying In ‘Beast Mode’	New imagery has appeared showing the Chinese J-20 stealth fighter carrying external air-to-air missiles, mirroring the so-called ‘beast mode’ that we’ve seen on U.S. fifth-generation fighters. The development comes as China looks at various ways of increasing the number of primary weapons that the J-20 can accommodate internally, while also working on various new longer-range air-to-air missiles. A video emerged recently showing a J-20 in flight, apparently fitted with eight PL-15 medium-to-long-range air-to-air missiles, carried in pairs on four underwing pylons. A screen capture from the same footage had begun to circulate late last year, although it wasn’t immediately clear if it was genuine. The appearance of the video would seem to put at rest most of those concerns. I think we have seen this image in a smaller version already in December (second image), but now an ever clearer, larger version and a video was leaked showing a J-20 in 'beast mode' carrying what appears to be 8x PL-15 (?) AAMs.(Image via @人畜无害遥感星 from Weibo) pic.twitter.com/hlwI5MCiFO&mdash; @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) February 10, 2025 Here an attempt to post a video of the video pic.twitter.com/EYB0rnB9q2&mdash; @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) February 10, 2025 It's meanwhile also well known that the J-20 has underwing hardpoints, since we have seen the fighter in the past carrying four large external fuel tanks, as you can read about here. #China #PLAAF #J20 #Stealth with four external drop tanks. via CDF/Deino,fxmdlr_ms pic.twitter.com/vTdUkyexSJ&mdash; 卫纳夜格.巴特 Col Vinayak Bhat (Retd) @Raj47 (@rajfortyseven) February 21, 2017 In fact, when we first became aware of the J-20 carrying drop tanks, we surmised that, in the future, the stealth fighter would likely also appear with weapons under their wings. In particular, we predicted that China’s very long-range air-to-air missile, now known to be designated as the PL-17, could end up arming the J-20, and that it would be carried externally. After all, the huge missile does not fit in the fighter’s weapons bay. Now, however, it seems that the ‘beast mode’ J-20 is carrying additional examples of the PL-15 — the aircraft’s standard medium-to-long-range air-to-air missile, reportedly able to hit targets at up to 124 miles. Already, the J-20 can carry four of these weapons in its main internal weapons bay. Close-up of a J-20 fighter carrying four inert examples of the original PL-15 in its main ventral bays. via Chinese Internet They can be supplemented by two short-range PL-10 air-to-air missiles. These infrared-guided weapons are deployed via novel side weapons bays, which allow the missiles to be exposed on the outside of the aircraft, with the doors closed behind them. You can read more about this fascinating aspect of the J-20’s design here. A J-20 with its short-range PL-10 air-to-air missiles deployed via the side weapons bays. via Chinese Internet Returning to the PL-15, this is an incredibly important component of China’s fast-developing airpower capabilities. In the past, the U.S. Air Force has publicly said that the emergence of the PL-15 was a key factor in the decision to start the AIM-260 program, which seeks to provide a new air-to-air missile with a range longer than that of the now-standard AIM-120 AMRAAM. The Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) defense and security think tank determines that the PL-15 'out-ranges the U.S.-made AIM-120C/D AMRAAM series and has a comparable maximum range to the Meteor.' This long range may be achieved through the use of a dual-pulse rocket motor, although this remains unconfirmed. The AIM-120D-3 is the latest variant of the combat-proven AMRAAM, developed under the Form, Fit, Function refresh, known as F3R. Raytheon An AIM-120D-3 sits at Raytheon’s Tucson, Arizona plant. The AIM-120D features the same clipped fins as the C model. (RTX) While we don’t know what — if anything — is in the internal weapons bays of the J-20 in the video, the potential for the aircraft to carry 12 PL-15s is very significant in terms of ‘magazine depth,’ although the penalty is the loss of the aircraft’s low-observable characteristics. This, however, is not necessarily a huge problem, if tactics are optimized to overcome it. In this way, it would be expected that a stealthy flight of J-20s (with all-internal missiles) would work in concert with a flight of J-20s in ‘beast mode.’ With the stealthy flight operating ahead, they would then call on the more heavily armed jets behind them as a force-multiplier, thereby overcoming their limited air-to-air missile carriage capability. In the same way, a J-20 in ‘beast mode’ could serve as something akin to an arsenal ship to support other tactical aircraft, including the forthcoming J-35 stealth fighter. China's Flanker-derivative series of fighters could also work in concert with stealthy J-20s in a similar fashion. Beyond the PL-15, China is also working on other air-to-air missiles that are likely to be added to the J-20’s armory. These include the aforementioned PL-17, a very long-range missile that may well be intended primarily to target high-value assets, like tankers and airborne early warning aircraft. You can read more about this still-mysterious missile here. As mentioned previously, this would only be available for external carriage on the J-20, although it’s unclear whether eight would be possible — four PL-17s underwing seems a much more likely maximum load-out with two being realistically more optimal for most missions. A 2016 image where the PL-17 first appeared. via Chinese Internet These two missiles are likely to be joined before long by another weapon, tentatively dubbed PL-16, the design of which seems to have been driven by the requirement for the J-20 to accommodate six longer-range missiles internally. The PL-16 will likely be superficially similar to the PL-15 but will be a compressed-carriage missile. It is expected to feature an active electronically scanned array (AESA) seeker, a Mach 5-plus fly-out speed, and significant resistance to jamming. This reflects similar trends in the United States, where, in addition to working on secretive new longer-range air-to-air missiles, there have been efforts to add more weapons to the F-22 and F-35, which are constrained by their internal weapons carriage — provided they are to retain their critical low-observability advantage. The F-35 can only carry four internal AMRAAMs, which led to a program to develop the Sidekick weapons bay adapter, which will boost the number of internal AMRAAMs a Joint Strike Fighter can carry to six. The current four-missile AIM-120 internal carriage configuration on the F-35. Crown Copyright In fact, the eight missiles that we see in the video would introduce the prospect of a J-20 that can eventually carry 14 medium/long-range air-to-air missiles, complemented by the pair of PL-10 shorter-range weapons, for a whopping 16 missiles in total. For comparison, the F-22 could theoretically carry a similar loadout, although this never happens in practice, nor is it clear if it that configuration has been tested. One of the F-15EXs biggest selling points is the ability to carry 12 AIM-120s today and possibly more tomorrow, as magazine depth becomes a greater concern in the increasingly complex domain of air-to-air combat. We still don't know whether this configuration is now operational or still in the test phase. It would seem likely, however, that we will learn more in due course and, at the same time, the development potentially opens up a much wider variety of external weapons carriage possibilities, too.

Russians Erect Mesh Net ‘Tunnel’ Over A Mile Long To Counter Ukra...	Russian troops have set up a 2km (1.24 mile) mesh netting 'tunnel' on a road linking Bakhmut and Chasiv Yar in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine. The mesh netting is designed to protect Russian logistics against first-person view (FPV) drones that have become a ubiquitous attack weapon for both sides. The move comes as Russian forces are launching another major push against the town of Chasiv Yar. 'To cover the supply routes of the Russian Armed Forces from FPV drones, military engineers are installing protective nets,' a Russian soldier said on a video showing the construction of the mesh net tunnel. 'Our group maintains more than two kilometers of anti-drone nets. The nets are placed on the most exposed sections of the roads to ensure the safe movement of our equipment. We strive to continuously expand the coverage area, enhancing the installation technology of the nets to set them up more quickly.' To protect themselves from Ukrainian drone attacks, the Russians have fenced off the road from Bakhmut to Chasiv Yar, creating a 2-km mesh tunnel. In this way, the Russians are trying to rescue their equipment and personnel from threats from drones. pic.twitter.com/qbtFvwrAcx&mdash; WarTranslated (@wartranslated) February 9, 2025 The video shows Russian troops unrolling a spool of mesh netting, which they then attached to 15- to 20-foot poles spaced evenly along both sides of the road. The theory is that the netting will provide a buffer to keep Ukrainian FPV drones from directly striking vehicles. 'The expectation is that the FPV drone, on the final trajectory of its attack, will simply get entangled with its propellers in the taut net or go off course, even if it manages to break it,' the Russian Military Informant Telegram channel wrote. Russian troops built a mesh net 'tunnel' to protect against Ukrainian FPV drones. (X screencap) You can see how Ukrainian FPV drones have affected Russian vehicle traffic in the following video. A road of death. Russia shows an area constantly targeted by Ukrainian FPV drones pic.twitter.com/2qZ2ZRui2b&mdash; Preston Stewart (@prestonstew_) February 5, 2025 The netting is the latest iteration of the ongoing efforts by each side to develop drone technology and ways to counter it. 'A year ago, the enemy created roads covered by electronic warfare posts,' Ukrainian drone expert Serhii Beskrestnovs, also known as Serhii Flash, wrote on Telegram about the mesh tunnel. 'Now drones have so many frequencies that it is not realistic to close them with electronic warfare (EW). And plus, drones with [artificial intelligence] and drones on fiber optic [cables] have appeared.' Yuri Podalyak, an influential Russian milblogger, suggested that the anti-FPV drone netting is a creation by troops in the field on an ad hoc basis because the Russian Defense Ministry is providing insufficient EW equipment. 'This is the ingenuity of the fighters against the bureaucrats of the General Staff who are still unable to understand that today electronic warfare is more important than tanks,' Podolyak wrote on Telegram. 'And even more so than a bunch of different expensive junk that was created for war and which is absolutely useless now. But which is still being mass-produced by our factories (and often ahead of schedule).' The anti-FPV drone system erected in Donetsk is not the first time Russians have tried to use netting on a grand scale to defeat these fast, highly maneuverable weapons. As we previously reported, the Russians used mesh nets strung between lamposts on a road near Bakhmut to try and break up and deter FPV drones. However, the Ukrainians quickly found a workaround, flying over the nets to strike targets behind them. That system, however, did not have side or top netting that would provide better, encapsulated protection. The following video shows how Ukrainian FPV drone operators overcame that netting. This morning there was a video with anti-drone nets hanging Wagner above the road near Bakhmut, and already in the evening a video testing their effectiveness pic.twitter.com/eGXVbfsrJ1&mdash; MilitaryNewsUA (@front_ukrainian) September 25, 2023 'Similar initiatives to hang anti-drone nets along roads in the Bakhmut direction have been observed since 2023. But such an extended single structure is encountered for the first time,' the Russian Military Informant Telegram channel noted. 'The downside is that such networks will need to be constantly updated, given the intensity with which the enemy uses its kamikazes against Russian logistics.' Another potential downside not addressed by Russian sources is how these nets would hold up against Ukrainian drone-dropped munitions. Those could take out not just the nets, but the poles supporting them, without exposing the drone to the mesh countermeasure. Even FPV drones with the ability to command detonate would also punch holes in these nets, allowing other FPVs to enter. Given the vast number of deadly FPV drones deployed, however, even an imperfect solution could prove beneficial. One noted Russian milblogger suggests that is already the case in Chasiv Yar, a town Russia has partially held since last July and is making another large push to capture the rest. 'Now, along the road, supplies are calmly flowing to the units liberating Chasiv Yar,' Oleg Tsarov posited on Telegram. The city, as the following video shows, has been devastated by the fighting. This is how the streets of Chasiv Yar in the Donetsk region look like now.Shots from fighters of the Donbas BSP of the 18th Slavic Brigade. Follow @blyskavka_ua pic.twitter.com/Cs5ZL6Rq1P&mdash; BLYSKAVKA (@blyskavka_ua) February 10, 2025 Still, creating a netted ‘tunnel’ of sorts will also confine Russian forces to a very narrow and well-defined corridor that can be bombarded by artillery and other means of attack. This could prove to be a far more ‘fatal funnel’ than what an open road plagued by FPV attacks would be. It will be interesting to see how successful this tactic ends up being. We will likely know more in the near future.

Indian Naval Collaborative Drone Concept Unveiled	Indian drone maker NewSpace Research and Technologies has officially unveiled a new jet-powered drone concept being pitched as a loyal wingman called Abhimanyu. The Indian Navy is now investing in the design as the basis for a future Naval Collaborative Combat Air Vehicle (N-CCAV), which it hopes to team with the service's existing carrier-based MiG-29K Fulcrums, Rafale-Ms expected to arrive in the coming years, and future domestically-developed fighters. A model of the current iteration of the Abhimanyu drone design is on display at the Aeroindia 2025 exhibition, which opened in the southern Indian city of Bengaluru earlier today. Angad Singh was generous enough to share pictures of the model, as well as renders the company has shared with journalists, with TWZ. Abhimanyu has been funded in part to date through the Indian Ministry of Defense's Innovations for Defence Excellence (iDEX) initiative, as well as internal company funding, according to Singh. iDEX has launched multiple rounds of Acing Development of Innovative Technologies (ADITI) innovation challenges since it was launched in 2018, including one centered on the Navy's N-CCAV needs. Indian defense outlet Livefist first reported over the weekend about Abhimanyu and the N-CCAV effort. A rendering of the Abhimanyu drone. NewSpace Research and Technologies via Angad Singh Details about the Abhimanyu drone itself are still very limited. The model at Aeroindia 2025, as well as the company renders, show a design with swept wings, horizontal stabilizers, and a single vertical tail. There are a pair of narrow air intakes for the drone's single jet engine, one on either side of the rear fuselage. Livefist says Abhimanyu was designed to have a low radar cross-section. A continuous chine-line that wraps around the fuselage is visible on the model and in the renders, which is a typical radar cross-section-reducting design feature. A main engine tucked away in the rear fuselage behind the low-profile air intakes would also help in this regard. The Abhimanyu's continuous chine-line is visible in this view of the model on display at Aeroindia 2025. Angad Singh As seen below, NewSpace's renderings also show what look to be trapezoidal-shaped main landing gear doors, another typical feature of stealth designs. No door for a nose wheel or weapons bays are readily visible. While the design clearly has features that reduce the aircraft's radar signature, it is not a low-observable design. NewSpace Research and Technologies via Angad Singh Placards that NewSpace has on display at Aeroindia 2025 along with the Abhimanyu model say the company is targeting a top speed of almost 300 knots (550 kilometers per hour), a 620-mile (1,000-kilometer) operational range, and a service ceiling of close to 19,700 feet (6,000 meters). This is relatively slow, short-range, and low-ceiling for a loyal wingman-type design, which does raise questions about the extent to which it will be able to directly operate together with faster-moving crewed combat jets. With proper planning, lower-performance drones can still enjoy teaming benefits, but with far less persistence and direct tactical cohesion with their high-performance fighter counterparts. It is worth noting that NewSpace has been working on the Abhimanyu project since at least 2023 and the current design differs completely from concepts the company has shown in the past. There has been talk previously of Abhimanyu being more of a group of designs rather than a single drone. The Indian Navy is now interested in a family of different versions of the Abhimanyu with increasingly diverse capabilities achieved through iterative development cycles, Angad Singh told TWZ. New design of NSRT Abhimanyu. Instead of external podded engines, the new design incorporates internally mounted engines with trapezoidal side intakes.@alpha_defense pic.twitter.com/a5gEMJW6cg&mdash; Frontliner (@FrontlinerUV) June 25, 2024 Abhimanyu drones with a mixture of capabilities might offer India's carrier air wings valuable added offensive and defensive capacity in cooperation with other crewed aircraft and forces down below. The pilotless planes could also help extend the sensor reach of a carrier strike group, including to provide better situational awareness and tactical flexibility. Depending on their exact capabilities, the Indian Navy might also be able to deploy N-CCAVs to locations ashore to support operations, which could also help make up for range and other limitations. NewSpace also promises a high degree of autonomy for Abhimanyu leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) technology. The company has already been testing AI/ML-driven autonomous capabilities as part of work on swarming technologies for much smaller drones. NewSpace also unveiled a new line of smaller uncrewed aerial systems with swarming capabilities, including kamikaze types, called Sheshnaag at this year's Aeroindia event. The company has done work in the past on so-called air-launched effects (ALE) type uncrewed systems in collaboration with the U.S. Air Force, as well. What unit cost NewSpace is targeting for Abhimanyu is unknown. 'Documents reviewed by Livefist suggest that NRT is developing the N-CCAV to be both cost-effective and expendable, with an emphasis on rapid production,' that outlet reported. That is certainly in line with the potential decoy role. There are some broad strokes similarities to the U.S. Navy's vision for 'consumable' carrier-capable Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones that could be expended as munitions or targets for training or testing purposes after short service lives measured in hundreds of flight hours rather than years. From what is known about it now, Abhimanyu is a notably lower-end concept compared to many other loyal wingman or CCA-like drone efforts globally, even those focused on lower costs and rapid production with capabilities balanced against those requirements. This includes the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) Warrior under development for the Indian Air Force's Combat Air Teaming System program. The twin-engine Warrior, a demonstrator or mockup thereof of which is also being shown at Aeroindia 2025, is understood to be much larger and heavier than the Abhimanyu. The demonstrator design, which HAL previously unveiled, also differs significantly from models and renders that had been shown in the past, especially the less stealthy configuration of the top-mounted air intake.

In 2021, it emerged that a subscale UCAV demonstrator, the Stealth Wing Flying Testbed, had flown at least once. China, India's top competitor, has also been very actively developing stealthy flying wing UCAVs. A number of other countries, including Russia, Turkey, and France, are doing the same. The U.S. military, at least publicly, very pointed abandoned work in this vein decades ago, as you can read more about here.

Yang Suping/VCG via Getty Images China and the United States, and now India, are among a growing number of countries with uncrewed naval aviation ambitions more specifically, efforts that also reflect the differing views on the future of uncrewed collaborative airpower. The Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) looks increasingly set to operate UCAVs from the decks of at least some of its aircraft carriers, as well as its new monster Type 076 amphibious assault ship, while the U.S. Navy remains more focused on its disposal CCA vision. For the Indian Navy, progress on the N-CCAV effort comes amid talk of scaling back its aircraft carrier plans. Indian media reported earlier this month that a proposed second domestically-produced flattop could ultimately replace the existing INS Vikramaditya, a heavily modified Soviet-era ship, rather than supplement it as had originally been expected. India has two carriers in service today, the other being the domestically-developed INS Vikrant. The Indian military, overall, does have a long history of upsets and resets on major defense procurement programs. It remains to be seen when any Abhimanyu drones actually begin to enter service regardless of what the country's carrier force might look like in the future. The current funding ceiling for Abhimanyu through iDEX is just around $2.85 million, according to Angad Singh. Much more funding is expected to be necessary to complete the design's initial development, as well as that of future variants with new capabilities. Abhimanyu has certainly now gotten another important vote of confidence from the Indian Navy. Special thanks again to Angad Singh for sharing the pictures of the Abhimanyu model and the renders, as well as information gleaned about the drone from Aeroindia 2025.

F-35 And Su-57 Face Off In India	A Russian Su-57 Felon next-generation fighter sharing tarmac with a U.S.-made F-35 stealth fighter is a truly unusual sight, and it has quickly become a signature image of the Aero India 2025 international airshow. With the Indian Air Force looking for new fighters, and with a complex path toward fielding its own fifth-generation combat aircraft, the rival jets have both been pitched, to some degree or another, toward emerging Indian requirements. However, it’s far from clear whether either of these advanced combat aircraft will be suitable, for varied reasons. The first-ever such meeting on the ground between Su-57 and F-35A (two of which were sent to the airshow) occurred at Aero India over the weekend. The airshow is taking place at Air Force Station Yelahanka in Bangalore, southwestern India, and is open to the public between February 10-14.

Photo by Idrees MOHAMMED / AFP IDREES MOHAMMED At the opening of the show, the Indian Ministry of Defense published a statement that made a fairly direct reference to the presence of the rival fighters.

The statement was made at the opening of Air India by Rosoboronexport chief Alexander Mikheev. Aero India 2025 at Air Force Station Yelahanka in Bangalore, seen from the cockpit of a Su-57. Photo by PJSC United Aircraft Corporation/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu Since it was first offered, the Felon has not achieved any confirmed export orders and previous plans for India to acquire it fell apart in dramatic fashion. As long ago as 2003, the Prospective Multirole Fighter (PMF) was planned as an India-specific version of the Su-57 (then still known by its T-50 prototype designation). This was intended to meet the requirements of the Indian Air Force’s Fifth-Generation Fighter Aircraft (FGFA) program. Russia and India signed a letter of intent covering the common development of the PMF, in January 2003, followed by a related inter-governmental agreement in 2007, and another contract covering the preliminary design of the aircraft in 2010.

The T-50 had made its first flight earlier the same year, on January 29. Photo by ALEXEY DRUZHININ/RIA NOVOSTI/AFP via Getty Images ALEXEY DRUZHININ The PMF would have had various new and modified systems, compared with the baseline Russian standard, including an N079 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, derived from the Russian N036. However, the project made only slow progress and was punctuated by some embarrassing incidents, including the fifth aircraft, T-50-5, catching fire on the runway at Zhukovsky, near Moscow in June 2014. This reported happened in full view of an Indian delegation. Regardless, by 2018, India had left the PMF program, as you can read about here. Nevertheless, Russia continues to push the Su-57E export version on the international marketplace. Last November, Rosoboronexport claimed that the first export contracts for the Su-57 had been signed, but, again, the buyer — or buyers — were not named. When it was first launched in 2018, Russia claimed that the Su-57E version would be 'significantly cheaper' than the F-35, although no numbers were provided. In 2019, a Su-57 was personally shown to Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan by his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, as seen in the video below, with the hope of securing Ankara’s interest in the Su-57E. Otherwise, Algeria and Egypt have been identified by analysts as possible customers, although Russia’s ostracization from much of the international community as a result of its war in Ukraine has further diminished the chances of major international arms sales. In India, meanwhile, the focus has been on the development of a homegrown fifth-generation fighter, the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA), although this is still a long way off, with the latest reports indicating it’s not planned to enter service until 2036. Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) has been officially working on the AMCA project since 2010 and, at one point, there was a stated goal of having a flying prototype by 2025. A model of the AMCA next-generation fighter. FlyingDaggers45SQUADRON/Wikimedia Commons In the meantime, the Indian Air Force faces the problem of a diminishing frontline fighter force driven by the retirement of older types, like the MiG-21 Fishbed — the Soviet-designed jet that was once the backbone of the service. This is compounded by a lack of movement on projects to buy foreign-made fighters as interim equipment, something that Angad Singh, an Indian defense journalist and contributor to this website, characterizes as 'decision paralysis.' Of course, the Indian Air Force would not have faced such problems had India’s Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Tejas program, the MiG-21’s designated successor, not suffered such lengthy delays. Currently, the Indian Air Force still has only two operational squadrons with the LCA Tejas Mk 1 and this is, in many ways a fairly limited combat aircraft — certainly when compared to fifth-generation types. Ultimately, only 40 examples are being purchased. An Indian Air Force Rafale and a Tejas Mk 1. IAF With that in mind, deliveries of the improved LCA Tejas Mk 1A are planned to start soon, allowing the Indian Air Force to finally dispose of its last MiG-21s. While more capable than the Tejas Mk 1, with more advanced radar, avionics, and weapons, the Mk 1A is still classified by the Indian Air Force as a fourth-generation type, putting it more or less on par with the South Korean FA-50, or the Saab Gripen, for example. The first series-production Tejas Mk 1A made its maiden flight from the HAL facility in Bengaluru on March 28, 2024. Hindustan Aeronautics Limited There are currently 83 Tejas Mk 1A fighters under contract, with plans to supplement this with another 97 aircraft, for a total of 180 Mk 1As. After that, 120 examples of the altogether more ambitious Tejas Mk 2 are set to be delivered to the Indian Air Force, between 2028 and 2035. Classified as 'generation 4++' fighters, these will be fitted with more powerful F414 engines and have much-improved performance as part of generally expanded capabilities. If all goes to plan, the experience with the Tejas Mk 2 should pave the way for the first of the all-new AMCA fifth-generation fighters to enter service in 2036. Currently, plans call for 120 aircraft to be procured under the AMCA program. First and only sign of the Tejas AF Mk.2&#8230;.Absolutely no talk about it anywhere or from anyone!!Strange pic.twitter.com/5xNyFnLuks&mdash; Vayu Aerospace Review (@ReviewVayu) February 10, 2025 The AMCA will feature a low-observable design, including internal weapons bays, new-generation AESA radar, and advanced avionics, and will be intended, from the outset, to operate alongside drones as part of ‘manned-unmanned’ teaming concept. Again, the AMCA is still a long way in the future and, based on prior experience, the program will likely face more delays of its own. With that in mind, and with so many different moving pieces in the Indian Air Force’s fighter puzzle, the service also launched the Multirole Fighter Aircraft (MRFA) competition. This aims to select an existing foreign-made fighter, with a total of 114 to be acquired, through a combination of off-the-shelf purchases and licensed production in India. Many might ask why India wouldn’t simply buy more Dassault Rafales, but when the 114-aircraft requirement was launched it was billed as being specifically for single-engine types, ruling out the French product. Since then, however, the competition appears to be wide open, with the F-15EX, for example, now also being offered to India, and with the Rafale and the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet also in the running. If India decides to procure another single-engine fighter, after all, the Indian-specific F-21 configuration of the F-16 is also a viable candidate.

Photo by Debajyoti Chakraborty/NurPhoto via Getty Images Debajyoti Chakraborty On the other hand, with its emphasis on a ‘non-controversial’ procurement of more ‘generation 4+’ fighters in the same class as the Rafale, the MRFA competition doesn’t appear to have a place for the Su-57, or the F-35. That brings us to the Joint Strike Fighter. In the past, there have been tentative offers of the F-35 to India, notably in 2018, when the then head of U.S. Pacific Command supposedly stated that he supported the sale of the stealth fighter to India.

It’s notable, too that, in the past Lockheed Martin hinted that India choosing its F-21 (essentially an advanced F-16, rebranded) might pave the way for the country to eventually join the F-35 program — although the company removed that claim from its official F-21 webpage shortly after it went live, as you can read about here. An artist’s impression of the F-21 that has been offered to India. Lockheed Martin For India, however, there is another potential sticking point, as Angad Singh explained to TWZ: 'Regardless of political winds in the United States, our case for the F-35 is complicated by the S-400 and the hordes of other Soviet/Russian equipment we operate.' It is worth recalling that it was the S-400 air defense system specifically that saw Turkey ejected from the F-35 program, even after the first aircraft had been built for the Turkish Air Force and with a significant industrial stake in the manufacturing effort. An S-400 air defense system during testing at Murdet Air Base near Ankara, Turkey, on November 25, 2019. Turkey purchased the weapons system from Russia over the objections of the United States, which excluded it from its F-35 program in response. Photo by Getty Images Getty Images So, while India acquiring the F-35 is by no means impossible, it would require significant negotiations, with safeguards and assurances that New Delhi might not be willing to agree to — especially if it meant giving up the S-400 or other high-end Russian-origin systems. With that in mind, could that somehow provide the Su-57 with another chance to win an Indian Air Force order? Singh is skeptical. 'The Felon, let’s be real, is probably the least-capable ‘fifth-generation’ fighter out there, and the least mature. Not a good combination. I don’t see the utility in it as a counter to Chinese fifth-generation developments.' Putting aside the respective capabilities of the Su-57 and a growing fleet of stealthy Chinese adversaries, there is also the fact that the Indian Air Force hasn’t necessarily had a good experience in the past with Russian imports — especially as regards after-sales support and maintainability. This is something that has only been exacerbated since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. 'The last thing the Indian Air Force needs is another decades-long debugging exercise like the Su-30MKI Flanker,' Singh observes. An Indian Air Force Su-30MKI during an exercise at Jodhpur in the Indian state of Rajasthan on November 8, 2022. Photo by Emmanuel DUNAND / AFP EMMANUEL DUNAND Once again, while the Indian Air Force is actively looking for new foreign-made fighters, neither the Su-57 nor the F-35 are really what the service needs and it has admitted as much in the past in terms of the aircraft that it has identified for the MRFA competition. Su57 of #Russia and F35 of #USA Sharing same airspace first time ever- Its only happened in #India. #AeroIndia Pic: @SauravChordia1 pic.twitter.com/WWTHXKsH3x&mdash; Manish Prasad (@manishindiatv) February 10, 2025 On the other hand, the Su-57 would appear to offer one clear advantage for India that the F-35 cannot compete with: the offer of local licensed production for the fighter, as HAL has done with the Su-30MKI. For India, offsets are an enormously important part of major defense acquisitions and the promise of technology transfers could also be tempting, especially as it sets to work on its own fifth-generation fighter program, the AMCA. While the appearance of the Su-57 and the F-35 together at Bangalore is certainly intriguing from the perspective of observers, it does also reinforce the urgency of the Indian Air Force’s need for new fighter equipment. With delays seemingly inbuilt for its various domestic combat aircraft programs, the need for interim fighter equipment is more obvious than ever. The Indian Air Force needs to decide on the outcome of the MRFA competition sooner rather than later. At this stage, however, the Su-57 and the F-35 both look to be outsiders.

Unprecedented New View Of BLU-109 Bunker Buster Strike That Kille...	Closed-circuit television video has emerged offering a new very up-close and personal view of the large-scale and highly-coordinated strike on Hezbollah's command bunker in Dahieh, a southern Beirut suburb and a stronghold of the militant organization, on September 27th, 2024. GBU-31/B Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) bombs with BLU-109/B bunker-busting warheads were the primary weapon used for this attack that killed Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah, as well as other top officials. It has been reported that dozens of civilians were killed and hundreds more were wounded in the attack. The decapitation strike aimed at the large bunker buried beneath a residential area was one of the key operations that sent the Iranian-backed militant group far off kilter, allowing for Israel's air and ground operations to have a far greater effect than they would have otherwise while limiting Hezbollah's ability to respond in kind. The pager and walkie-talkie sabotage operation that preceded this strike was another. Hezbollah remains heavily degraded today with the fall of the Assad regime in Syria, a key ally outside of Tehran, being another massive blow that came months later. BLU-109 with JDAM tail kits. (USAF) The video below shows what appears to be a normal day in Dahieh, with people moving about, including two motorcyclists that are shown in-frame. Then the bunker busters arrive. One is seen burrowing deep through the concrete roadway, narrowly missing one of the motorcyclists, followed by a massive subterranean explosion that 'lifts' the entire surrounding area. This is exactly the effect of a bunker buster like the BLU-109. The bomb's tough casing allows it to penetrate deep underground with its delayed fuzing detonating the warhead at a predetermined depth or even level of a reinforced compound.

Israel’s unprecedented sowing of pagers and other electronics containing small explosive charges into Hezbollah’s supply chains had already underscored its deep penetration into the group. Israel's strike is known to have involved the use of many GBU-31/Bs with BLU-109/B warheads delivered by at least eight F-15Is. Pre-strike imagery of the F-15s shows eight of them loaded to the brim with seven BLU-109/B-equipped JDAMs each, for a total of 56 bombs for the strike. Other reports put the number at over 80 bombs. ویدیویی از بلند شدن جنگنده های F-15 نیروی هوایی اسراییل مجهز به بمب GBU-31 و هسته سنگرشکن BLU-109 با وزن 2000 پوند برای حمله به مقر حسن نصرالله در بیروت روز گذشته: pic.twitter.com/Psn6BYUQ96&mdash; Awes spad (@awes_spad) September 28, 2024 IAF IAF IAF IAF It’s unclear whether or not Israel has received any BLU-116/Bs, a 2,000-pound-class penetrator featuring various improvements over the BLU-109/B, including an advanced smart fuze and the ability to punch through nearly 12 feet of reinforced concrete. The development of another 2,000-pound-class penetrator, the BLU-137/B, as a replacement for the BLU-109/B also began at least a decade ago, but to what extent that weapon is even in U.S. military service currently is not clear. Just today, the U.S. government approved the potential sale to Israel of additional JDAM kits specifically for use with the BLU-109/B, as well as precision-guided bombs and related components.

Different fuzing could have been employed to take out multiple levels of the complex and/or to ensure areas where the depth of the target wasn't known still resulted in the desired level of destruction. Layering in multiple BLU-109/Bs atop each other, allowing them to 'dig' deeper than they could if used in a singular manner, is also likely to have been used as there are reports that the bunker was located as deep as 60 feet below the surface.

'There are reports from military personnel of multiple cases of volunteers delivering mined FPV Skyzone Cobra goggles,' Razved Dozor claimed. 'The goggles contain improvised explosive devices (IED) with 10-15 grams of plastic explosive. Detonation occurs when the goggles are turned on.' Razved Dozor posted several pictures and a video claiming to show these goggles and the explosives embedded in them.

As FPV drones have played an increasingly important combat role, there have been crowd-sourced efforts by both sides to supply drones, goggles and other required equipment to front-line troops. It is unclear how many of these sabotaged goggles were sent out. Authorities intercepted several after the condition of the boxes raised suspicions. 'The boxes with the glasses themselves show weak signs of being opened,' the Russian Readovka news outlet reported on Friday. 'Only thanks to the vigilance of the military was it possible to avoid a catastrophe. Information about what happened has already been passed on to the security forces, and the perpetrator of the assassination attempt is being identified.' 'The sender is listed as a certain Roman,' Readovka noted. 'The parcels were sent via SDEK,' a large global logistics company. A box of allegedly explosive-laden FPV goggles sent to Russian troops. (Via X) Though the goggles contained only a small amount of explosives, 'the power of the explosion would have been enough to break a temple,' the popular Alex Parker Returns Telegram channel explained. 'The work was done rather sloppily, traces of opening were visible on the glasses and therefore sabotage was miraculously avoided. I am sure that this is only the beginning and further intensity of such sabotage will only increase. What a horror.' Ukrainians 'were able to repeat the trick with pagers,' Alex Parker Returns suggested in a reference to the Israeli pager and walkie-talkie attack on Hezbollah. The first wave of those explosions, on Sept. 17, 2024, targeted pagers used by Hezbollah that were triggered simultaneously. The second wave of explosions, on the following day, targeted walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah. You can read more details about how it unfolded in our reporting here. A photo taken on September 18, 2024, in Beirut's southern suburbs shows the remains of exploded pagers on display at an undisclosed location. . (Photo by AFP) While the Israeli and suspected Ukrainian plots to embed explosives in devices used by their enemies are similar, there is one big difference. The Israeli attack was far more sophisticated, with pagers and walkie-talkies triggered by a specific message command sent simultaneously to thousands of devices. It also came after years of espionage work, which included setting up front companies and an elaborate supply chain. The FPV plot just required the goggles to be powered up, meaning that if one exploded, it would likely warn other operators, reducing the number of casualties. Russian milbloggers remain concerned that this may be only the beginning of a much larger campaign. With good reason. The fact that a sabotage attempt of this nature has occurred means that any electronics that troops interface with could be at risk of similar tampering. Having to physically disassemble every device that is needed to fuel a very hot war would drastically slow down supply chains. It also causes deep psychological effects on troops who now have to wonder if any item they pickup is similarly equipped. We will have to wait and see how the Russian military reacts at scale going forward.

Chinese Tank’s Active Protection System Seen Intercepting Drone-F...	A recently emerged video shows testing of the Chinese GL-6 active protection system (APS), including against a drone-launched rocket-propelled grenade. High-angle top-down attacks are particularly threatening to tanks and other armored vehicles and can present challenges for many APSs. The footage also highlights the potential of hard-kill APSs to provide a valuable additional layer of defense against uncrewed aerial threats, including highly maneuverable first-person view (FPV) kamikaze drones, something TWZ has previously explored in an in-depth feature. The video of the GL-6 testing, seen below, first began circulating on social media yesterday after being broadcast by state-run television outlets in China. The footage shows variants of the Soviet-designed RPG-7 rocket-propelled grenade, or of the Chinese copy, the Type 69, being fired at a Type 96 tank, or at least the turret from one, fitted with the APS. The rocket-propelled grenades are seen fired from a commercial-style hexacopter drone, as well as a test fixture at ground level. One clip notably shows the GL-6 engage a top-down threat and then quickly shift to respond to one coming in laterally.

Many hard-kill APS designs on the market globally, such as the combat-proven Trophy from Israel's Rafael, use some combination of projectiles designed to destroy or at least disrupt their targets and associated sensor arrays. Israeli firms have been and continue to be particular pioneers in this space.

The GL-6 is not new, having been seen publicly displayed since at least 2022. There is evidence that it has been tested, if not fielded on several Chinese armored vehicles already. This includes the Type 99/ZTZ-99 main battle tank and a new infantry fighting vehicle capable of being air-dropped that first emerged last year, the official designation of which is not yet known. It is also being offered for export, including as an option for the VT-4A1 main battle tank. #China has modernized the Type 99 main battle tank (ZTZ-99).The tank is equipped with a new GL-6 active protection system against anti-tank missiles and high-explosive fragmentation shells.

Within this, there has also been work to expand the ability of APSs to tackle threats with specialized top-down-attack capabilities, as well as typical lateral attack profiles. A prime example of the former is the U.S. TOW 2B anti-tank missile, which has a tandem warhead that detonates downward as it passes over its target. There is also just the danger of enemy forces using high ground to launch high-angle top-down attacks, especially in dense urban environments. The tops of tanks and other armored vehicles are typically their most vulnerable points and their crews often have limited situational awareness even in open field conditions, especially if they are buttoned up inside the hull for added protection. In addition, as noted, the new GL-6 testing footage highlights the additional role defensive systems could play against similarly expanding dangers posed by uncrewed aerial systems. Drones, especially highly maneuverable maneuverable FPV kamikaze types, can be used to conduct both top-down and lower-angle attacks. Though the threat of drone attacks, including on armored vehicles specifically, is not new, something TWZ regularly highlights, the ongoing war in Ukraine has been instrumental in thrusting that reality into the public consciousness. Both Russian and Ukrainian forces now make daily use of FPV kamikaze types, as well as weaponized commercial designs capable of dropping small munitions. Various tiers of armed uncrewed aerial systems are now a common feature in hotspots globally and new advances driven by artificial intelligence and machine learning promise to make them even more deadly, as you can read more about here.

Copes cages first appeared on Russian tanks in the immediate lead-up to the all-invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and have now become commonplace on both sides of that conflict. Such screens have been increasingly showing up on vehicles elsewhere around the world. Cope cage-type armor has popped up on platforms beyond ground vehicles, too.

In our feature last year, TWZ noted that there were already examples of defense contractors adding anti-drone capability to their APSs or at least looking to do so. This past October, Israel's Rafael notably announced that it had added new functionality to the Trophy systems specifically to enable it to defeat drone attacks. It is important to note that hard-kill APSs, even just against ATGMs and other infantry anti-armor threats, are not a silver bullet solution in themselves. Modern armored vehicle design is defined by continually evolving layers of defensive capabilities. The new GL-6 testing footage is the latest evidence of the general trend toward hard-kill APSs becoming not just valuable, but essential additions to tanks and other armored vehicles. This only looks set to be increasingly the case if systems like this can also demonstrate their ability to provide added protection against drones.

Germany Kicks Off Work On Leopard 3 Main Battle Tank	Germany has moved a step closer to building a new main battle tank — already dubbed Leopard 3 — with a contract issued for technical studies of 130mm ammunition, as well as a powerplant, protection systems, and other equipment. The resulting systems are expected to find their way into an interim tank that will be operated by the German military pending the arrival of an all-new Franco-German main battle tank. This more advanced tank may well also end up using some of the same equipment now being studied. The German Armed Forces procurement office, the BAAINBw, published details of the technical studies on TED, the European online procurement platform. The announcements were first reported in the media by the German defense and security website hartpunkt. These reveal that technical studies have been commissioned to cover three different areas: firepower, mobility, and protection. So it seems Germany might be developing a Leopard 3 tank. Recent contracts announced by the BAAINBw point to the following developments: - Ammunition for the @RheinmetallAG 130 mm gun- New engine from @Liebherr - Improved protection from @hensoldt - And improvements to the… pic.twitter.com/a87dE9mtpz&mdash; Sam Cranny-Evans (@Sam_Cranny) February 6, 2025 All of these new technologies are intended to be compatible with the existing Leopard 2 main battle tank. However, should they eventually be integrated into a single platform, the result will be a significantly different tank. This will likely be designated Leopard 3 — although it has also been described as the Leopard 2 AX or 'the bridge solution.' The study for 130mm ammunition will be conducted by Rheinmetall. This reflects a broader interest in moving to increased-caliber tank armament and the gun itself is something that Rheinmetall has been working on for some time now. A size comparison of Rheinmetall’s original 120mm gun, its extended L55 variant, and an earlier, proposed 140mm type. The new 130mm design is shorter than the 120mm L55. Rheinmetall This work is broken down into three components, for three different ammunition types: the DM13 rounds that will be used as qualification ammunition for trials; DM11 multifunctional high-explosive ammunition; and DM23 kinetic-energy anti-armor ammunition. It was previously known that a large-caliber 130mm main gun was being planned for the Main Ground Combat System (MGCS) a Franco-German project that seeks to field an advanced new main battle tank as well as a ‘system of systems’ of other crewed and uncrewed vehicles. The tank component is expected to ultimately replace Germany’s existing Leopard 2s, as well as France’s Leclercs. Rheinmetall’s 130mm gun has also been around for some time. The smoothbore gun, with 52 caliber lengths, was first revealed in prototype form in 2016. At the time, Rheinmetall said that the new gun would offer a 50 percent increase in kinetic energy compared with the 120mm gun used on the Leopard 2. While this is significant, in terms of penetration power, the larger gun is also notably heavier and bulkier than the 120mm weapon. When it was unveiled, Rheinmetall said the 130mm gun weighed more than 7,700 pounds, compared with around 6,600 pounds for the 120mm gun. At the same time, the larger projectiles fired — each of which weighs more than 66 pounds and is around 4.2 feet long — require an automatic loader within a turret of revised design. Rheinmetall’s 130mm tank gun. Note the difference in the size of the ammunition, at left, compared to a standard 120mm round. Rheinmetall Rheinmetall has already carried out firing demonstrations with the 130mm gun, as well as extensive simulations and studies. Meanwhile, Liebherr will be responsible for the study for a new engine, known as OLYMP. Like the 130mm main gun, this will be tailored for the ‘interim’ Leopard 3, but it could potentially have other applications too. In the past, Liebherr has developed and produced engines for the Marder 1 infantry fighting vehicle as well as its successor, the Lynx KF41. The BAAINBw description specifies a complete engine block, comprising the combustion engine itself as well as steering, manual gearbox, cooling system, combustion air filtration, and exhaust system. Also required are engine mounts to attach the power pack to the chassis, side gears, and connections to the control system and fuel supply. The study calls for the use of as many existing components from the Leopard 2 as possible. Hensoldt and KNDS Deutschland are the two companies commissioned to study the increased level of protection for the Leopard 3. This calls for the development of a 'significantly more combat-capable variant of the MUSS,' a reference to Hensoldt’s existing Multifunctional Self-Protection System. This may result in a further enhancement of the MUSS 2.0 the company presented last year, for use on the Puma infantry fighting vehicle and other platforms. The MUSS 2.0 installed on a Puma infantry fighting vehicle. Hensoldt The current MUSS 2.0 is a lighter-weight and lower-profile system than the original MUSS. It essentially consists of four passive sensors located around the vehicle. Each of these sensors combined a missile and laser warning sensor, as well as a laser-based infrared jammer and an infrared countermeasures dispenser. The system is designed to defend against anti-tank guided missiles, but it can also detect tracer rounds, muzzle flashes, projectile fire, and low-power lasers. The MUSS 2.0 is able to detect different threats simultaneously, prioritize them, and then counter them, in semi- or fully autonomous modes. The threat database can also be regularly updated, to deal with new and emerging threats. Finally, two further technical studies have been awarded to Hensoldt and to KNDS Germany, calling for work in a field adjustment system. This is required to compensate for the effects of barrel bend, a phenomenon that is caused by changes in temperature and which can affect the accuracy of the main gun. In the Leopard 2, a manual system is used for field adjustment, which is the responsibility of the gunner. The BAAINBw wants a new system to be fully automated so that regular manual adjustment is no longer necessary. The interim main battle tank, if development continues, will provide the German Armed Forces with a tank that will serve at least until the introduction of an all-new fighting vehicle, being developed under the MGCS project. The report from hartpunkt, which cites unnamed defense insiders, suggests that the interim Leopard 3 (provided it receives this designation) will be 'adapted to the current threat level in terms of performance and will have additional capabilities compared to the Leopard 2A8.' The latter is currently the most advanced production version of the Leopard 2. The report adds that the interim tank should start to enter service in the 2030s — if the German government gives it the go-ahead. The tank should then serve for around 25 years. A Leopard 2A8 tank. KNDS At this stage, the final specifications of the Leopard 3 are still to be determined, and they will likely be refined after these three technical studies are completed. The German Armed Forces procurement office expects this work to be finished by the end of 2026. It’s unclear where the new technical studies will leave the Leopard 2 A-RC 3.0 version of the Leopard 2, which was rolled out by Franco-German defense conglomerate KNDS last summer, as you can read about here. This new version of the Leopard 2 features a completely uncrewed turret that can be armed with an even larger 140mm main gun. The tank also features a built-in anti-tank guided missile launcher and a remote weapon station armed with a 30mm cannon optimized for engaging drones, a threat that has now fully emerged thanks to the war in Ukraine. The Leopard 2 A-RC 3.0. The pop-up missile launcher is visible on top of the turret. KNDS KNDS wants to offer the Leopard 2 A-RC 3.0 for sale but also expects it to be a key stepping stone to the next-generation MGCS. Last year, KNDS announced it would establish a new joint company with Germany’s Rheinmetall and Thales in France specifically to work on MGCS. As for Rheinmetall, this company also unveiled its own next-generation tank, the KF51 Panther, back in 2022. The KF51 also has a 130mm main gun — as specified for the new interim tank — in a more traditional crewed turret. That turret also features a built-in launcher for missiles or drones and the option to install a remote weapon station on top. You can read more about the Panther’s design and capabilities here. An artist’s concept of the KF51 Panther. Rheinmetall It had previously seemed likely that the Leopard 2 A-RC 3.0 would find itself in direct competition with the KF51 and, while that may be the case for sales outside Germany, the latest technical studies suggest that the BAAINBw is eyeing a different solution. While this will be broadly based on the Leopard 2, it will be a more ambitious project than the Leopard 2 A-RC 3.0, which does not — as far as is known — include a new powerplant. Regardless, it’s notable that Germany is once again very active in tank development, something that reflects wider trends. After years during which many tank operators either reduced their fleets or removed them altogether, armored warfare is now experiencing something of a renaissance, spurred, in no small part, by the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. While France and Germany remain committed to the MGCS, the German Armed Forces clearly see a requirement for a main battle tank that can be introduced to service before this next-generation fighting vehicle becomes available. In the meantime, these German studies for an interim main battle tank — whatever it might be called — look like they could also provide a pointer to what the future MGCS tank could look like.

Iran’s Wacky Aircraft Carrier Has Entered Service	Iran has finally shown a drone taking off and landing on – in the latter case with the help of arresting gear – the deck of the country's unusual new 'drone carrier,' the Shahid Bagheri. Newly emerged imagery also shows various drones and crewed helicopters on the flight deck, which has a ski jump at the bow end, including the appearance of 'drones' styled after the infamous Qaher 313. Officially touted as a sea base-like ship, Shahid Bagheri has now been shown launching a small missile boat and is armed itself with cruise missiles along with weapons for self-defense. The new pictures and videos of the Shahid Bagheri were released around a ceremony earlier today marking its formal entry into service with the naval arm of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). The conversion of the 'carrier' from a commercial container ship reportedly started in May 2022 and it began sea trials in its new configuration in November of last year. The imagery from today's ceremony includes footage showing a modified Ababil-3 drone with an arresting hook, which does not appear to retract or otherwise be capable of being stowed during flight, launching from the Shahid Bagheri's 590-foot (180-meter) flight deck. What is presumably the same drone is seen in another clip recovering on the deck by catching an arresting wire with its hook. The Ababil-3 also has two small turbojet engines installed, one under each wing, which could provide valuable additional performance for operations from a short flight deck without the aid of a catapult 2.

(@mhmiranusa) February 6, 2025 How permanent the 'carrier' modifications to the Ababil-3 might actually be and whether a more refined design is in the works are unknown. At its core, the Ababil-3 is otherwise a well-established Iranian design in active service in Iran, as well as other operators in the Middle East, including Iranian-backed proxies in the Middle East. The drone is capable of performing surveillance and reconnaissance missions and employing small precision munitions. Video clips show small remote control plane-esque 'drones,' styled on Iran's Qaher 313 aircraft taking off and landing on Shahid Bagheri's deck, as well. Larger drones, or mock-ups thereof, with a design in line with the Qaher 313 are also seen on the deck. There are unconfirmed reports that the larger and smaller types are 60 and 20 percent of the size of the original Qaher 313, respectively. Both are seen marked JAS-313 and one of them is seen in a clip being lifted up to the flight deck on an elevator. What their actual capabilities they might have are unknown. 2 new drones derived on the Qaher-313 project were unveiledThe first, is a 60% scaled version dubbed JAS-313, which likely serves as an armed strike droneLikely has some kind of internal bay for smaller missiles/PGMs pic.twitter.com/PDnXdhRtmv&mdash; Iran Defense|نیروهای مسلح جمهوری اسلامی ایران (@IranDefense) February 6, 2025 Another photo of the Iranian JAS-313 drones onboard the IRGCN drone carrier Shahid Bahman Bagheri.Looks like they ran out of the exhaust covers and covered the left one's exhaust with glue tape and plastic cover. pic.twitter.com/mEqahSz8oa&mdash; Mehdi H. (@mhmiranusa) February 6, 2025 The Qaher 313, also known as the Q-313 and F-313, which first appeared publicly in 2013, is itself a dubious and widely ridiculed design that has never flown. Iranian media has shown imagery in the past of a remote control plane-like subscale model of the design, as seen in the video below. In 2023, media outlets in Iran reported that an uncrewed variant or derivative was in development. Subsequent reports claimed that a Qaher 313-derived drone had made its maiden flight last year. Other types of drones are also seen on Shahid Bagheri's deck in the imagery from today's ceremony. This includes the Mohajer-6, another popular Iranian design in service in Iran and many other places globally, including now with the Russian armed forces. American-designed Bell Model 206 and Model 212 helicopters, as well as Russian-made Mi-17 Hips, are seen operating from the ship's flight deck. Despite the aforementioned clip of the aircraft elevator, no views have yet emerged of any internal aircraft hangars. 9.

Using small boats armed with missiles and other weapons in swarms has long been a signature tactic of the IRGC's naval arm. There are claims that the ship can be used to launch uncrewed surface vessels *(USV) and underwater vehicles (UUV). Government of Iran Pictures that have now emerged, as seen below, also show one of Shahid Bagheri's boat launching ports being used as a way to connect, via a ramp, to a smaller landing craft-like vessel alongside. In this way, the 'carrier' could more rapidly load and unload personnel and materiel, including for onward movement ashore. Government of Iran Government of Iran The Shahid Bagheri has its own onboard armament, including launchers at the aft end that look to be for anti-ship cruise missiles and a turret with what appears to be an automatic cannon at the bow. The ship otherwise has a large open area at the aft end behind its main superstructure that could be used for various purposes, including as an additional flight deck for helicopters and vertical takeoff and landing capable drones, as well as additional missile launchers, especially containerized types. Iranian officials claim the ship has short and medium-range air defenses, as well as electronic warfare and intelligence-gathering capabilities, but any clear evidence thereof is less visible from the imagery that has now emerged. A look at Shahid Bagheri from the rear. Launchers that look to be for anti-ship cruise missiles are seen behind the ship's main superstructure. Government of Iran A close-up of Shahid Bagheri's bow showing the cannon turret. A pair white-colored systems are also visible on either side of the ski job, but their exact purpose is unclear.

Soccer pitch of the IRGCN drone carrier Shahid Bahman Bagheri. pic.twitter.com/QyZNArXGDn&mdash; Mehdi H. (@mhmiranusa) February 6, 2025 Major questions about Shahid Bagheri's capabilities do remain. As TWZ has noted in the past, the retention of the original container ship's main superstructure toward the aft end immediately creates an unusual flight deck arrangement. After images of the ship largely completed emerged last year we wrote: 'The fact that the Shahid Bagheri retains the original superstructure, which spans the entire width of the deck, means that a conventional flattop configuration cannot be adopted. Instead, an angled flight deck provides the requisite runway length, presumably for launch and recovery. Adding the angled deck — which extends all the way to the bow ramp — involves the construction of a prominent overhang or flare on the left-hand side of the vessel. In contrast to the satellite image seen below, the angled deck now has white-painted markings applied, showing the margins, which extend to the end of the ramp, as well as the centerline.' &#8230; 'The dimensions are very tight and the superstructure is located immediately next to the angled deck area, meaning that recovering aircraft, if indeed they plan on recovering aircraft, could hit the superstructure even with a small error in its flight path.' 'If the angled deck is used, and aircraft don’t make a full stop after touching down, they will head up the ski jump again, but will they have the power to actually fly off for another attempt? It’s also unclear if the vessel will use arresting wires to bring drones to a stop, or perhaps a barrier recovery system for some type.' We now know that at least some level of arresting gear has been fitted, though it remains unclear if the installation was temporary in nature for the commissioning events and whether more refinements may be coming. So far, the modified Ababil-3 and the smaller of the two JAS-313s are the only fixed-wing craft we have seen use the ship's flight deck, as well. Government of Iran How Iran might employ the ship remains an open question, though what we have now seen is entirely in line with our past assessments. TWZ previously wrote: 'The question of what aircraft will fly from this odd ship is key to understanding the goal of its design. Medium-altitude, long-endurance types seem like ideal candidates, as do vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) drones and many of the one-way attack munitions Iran currently fields. Jet-powered, higher-performance drones could potentially call the carrier home, which would help explain some of its features. In this way, the vessel could also be used to launch heavier and longer-range drones, including one-way attack types, which would be an advantage. We just don’t know at this time.' 'Regardless, there is ample space on the side opposite the angled deck extension for many types of drones and other modular weaponry. The aft deck behind the superstructure could field helicopters or smaller catapult and net/line-recovered drone types too. Cruise missiles launched from containers on trailers or trucks are another option and something that Iran already has experience of using.' &#8230; 'While it wouldn’t necessarily be expected to launch its drones against U.S. and allied warships and other assets in the region in some sustained manner, the Shahid Bagheri could conceivably wreak havoc on commercial shipping, including more opportunistic attacks against poorly defended targets, even for a brief period.' &#8230; 'Having the ability to launch drones, especially one-way attack drones, from a dedicated drone carrier could be beneficial in some scenarios against some enemies, as well as for ‘gray zone’ attacks. It remains very questionable, however, how long the Shahid Bagheri would survive were it to be used in an offensive capacity like this. The fact that it can deploy these capabilities, potentially anywhere around the globe, also gives it a unique place in Iran’s military portfolio. While it may not survive long after doing so, being able to threaten targets far beyond its current reach using weapons launched from its own country or by its proxies certainly seems like an asymmetric play Iran would go for, regardless of its actually tactical relevance.' Government of Iran The Shahid Bagheri does also join a number of other one-off sea base-like ships with aviation and other capabilities already in service with the IRGC and the regular Iranian Navy. Iran has also used modified commercial vessels as covert motherships to coordinate attacks, including by regional proxies, and to conduct intelligence-gathering missions. In addition, Shahid Bagheri carries significant symbolic value for Iran, which regularly rails against U.S. Navy carriers and other warships operating near the country in the Persian Gulf. In turn, Iranian officials have increasingly sought to mount long-distance naval deployments, including in the Western Hemisphere. It is claimed that Shahid Bagheri has an operational range of 22,000 nautical miles, which, while dubious, is in line with these more global ambitions. Whatever actual capabilities Shahid Bagheri offers, it does also reflect a real global trend toward the construction of new big deck warships heavily focused on drone operations, as well as the conversion of existing vessels into differing degrees of 'drone carrier.' Countries that operate traditional flattops, including the United States, are increasingly looking to expand the uncrewed components of their carrier air wings, as well. With Shahid Bagheri now officially commissioned into IRGC service, we are likely to start seeing more of what it can actually do and how the Iranians intend to employ it.

Ukraine Launches New Offensive Push In Russia’s Kursk Region	Ukraine has staged a new offensive in Kursk, according to the Russian Defense Ministry (MoD) and mibloggers. However, its scale and objective remain unclear at the moment and Ukrainian officials have yet to comment. Ukraine first invaded this Russian region six months ago to the day. Most accounts say that Ukrainian forces are attacking southeast of Sudzha, their main stronghold in the salient. There are differing assessments of the success of that advance.

'Units of the North group of forces thwarted an attempt by the Ukrainian Armed Forces to conduct counteroffensive actions in the direction of the settlements of Cherkasskaya Konopelka and Ulanok in the Kursk region,' the MoD stated on Telegram. 'All attacks were repelled.' The MoD claimed that Ukraine launched eight waves of attacks with 'up to two mechanized battalions in infantry fighting vehicles and armored combat vehicles, supported by tanks and obstacle clearing vehicles.' The Kremlin-connected Rybar Telegram channel offered a different view a few hours earlier. Ukrainian formations, claimed Rybar, continued attacks in the direction of Ulanok and Russkaya Konopelka. Those villages are about four miles south and five miles east respectively of Sudzha. 'Based on objective control footage, the enemy was able to pass through Cherkasskaya Konopelka, but two armored fighting vehicles were hit by UAV strikes from the 177th separate air defense regiment on the highway north of Fanaseyevka,' Rybar wrote. 'Information about the status of Fanaseyevka itself is still not clear, but the loss of Cherkasskaya Konopelka by Russian troops is confirmed. Most of the footage so far appears from the roads right near this settlement.' That village is about two miles southeast of Sudzha. Rybar suggested that the appearance in this advance of mine-clearing equipment and tank recovery vehicles pointed to Ukraine trying to make a major push. The Telegram channel noted that video emerged on social media showing such vehicles being destroyed. One was a U.S.-donated M1150 Assault Breacher Vehicle (ABV). A variant of the M1A1 Abrams, it is one of the world’s most capable combat mine-clearing vehicles.

At the moment, the nature of those plans remains unclear. The only mention of Kursk in the latest Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff battlefield assessment is a terse sentence: 'Five clashes have occurred in the Kursk direction since the beginning of the day.' One Russian milblogger posited that the operation could be a 'diversionary maneuver' to draw forces from other directions. 'The next few days will be extremely tense in the entire Kursk direction,' well-known milblogger Roman Alekhine wrote on Telegram. 'So to those who are helping in this direction, continue to help your units!' BBC Russia painted a gloomy picture of Ukraine’s prospects for advancing much beyond the 500 square miles of the existing salient, which is about half what it was at its peak. 'This section of the front does not look promising for the Armed Forces of Ukraine - it is an impassable and sparsely populated area, and the main cities of the Kursk region are located in other directions, to the north of Sudzha,' the outlet explained. One likely goal 'is to push the Russian units that have advanced closer to the regional center to the east, and to remove the threat of its assault,' BBC postulated. 'In the case of the loss of control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine over Sudzha, the retention of the rest of the territory of the Kursk region loses its meaning.' Ukraine invaded Kursk on Aug. 6, 2024 and both sides have suffered a large number of casualties and lost equipment. The importance of this region to both sides was highlighted by North Korea's decision to send some 12,000 troops to the region, about a third of which are said to have been killed or wounded.

(Photo by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's Social Media / Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images) Anadolu While Ukrainian military officials have remained quiet about what’s happening in Kursk today, Ukrainian President Voldodymry Zelensky talked about the importance of holding on to the territory it captured. 'The aggressor and criminal can and should be fought in their own home,' Zelensky said on X earlier on Thursday. 'The occupier can and should be confronted on their own territory. And this is not only fair, but also effective—for protecting lives in our country and across Europe. The Kursk operation clearly demonstrates the essence of the ‘peace through strength principle.'

Next week, three major meetings of world political and military leaders will take place in Europe. The future of this nearly three-year-old war will be the main focus. Next Wednesday, U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey will lead a meeting of Kyiv’s allies under the Ukraine Defense Contact Group format, a coalition of some 50 nations brought together to help arm Ukraine. It was the brainchild of former U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, but now the U.K. is taking charge, the British Ministry of Defense said on Thursday. 'The meeting is scheduled ahead of a summit of NATO defense ministers in Brussels, but the Ukraine grouping, also known as the Ramstein Format, is far bigger, including more than 50 allies,' Politico noted. In addition, the Munich Security Conference will take place between Feb. 14 and 16. The announcement that U.S. President Donald Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia will be attending set off speculation that a peace plan would be unveiled there. However, Keith Kellogg shot that suggestion down. 'The only guy that can do that in the world, and bring this to a conclusion, is Donald J. Trump,' Kellogg told Newsmax.

F-15EX Nails Pentagon Test Campaign, Survivability Concerns Remai...	In its latest annual report, the Office of the Director, Operational Test & Evaluation (DOT&E) provides an absolutely glowing assessment of the F-15EX Eagle II, the latest fighter to enter U.S. Air Force service. However, the assessment also offers a note of caution, especially when it comes to the survivability of the fighter when faced with potential future threats. In the report, the Pentagon provides an update on the status of the F-15EX, which was approved for full-rate production in June of last year. It also reinforces the fact that, at present, the two-seat F-15EX is primarily an air superiority platform, despite its multirole capability. An F-15EX arrives at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. The aircraft is the first in the Air Force to be tested and fielded from beginning to end through combined developmental and operational tests. The 40th Flight Test Squadron and the 85th Test and Evaluation Squadron personnel are responsible for testing the aircraft. U.S. Air Force U.S. Air Force photo/1st Lt. Karissa Rodriguez The F-15EX could potentially take on a multi-role missions once it’s established in service, but for now, the air-to-air mission is the priority. Specifically, the report notes, this includes missions such as offensive counter-air, cruise-missile defense, and defensive counter-air capabilities, including escort of high-value airborne assets. At this point, the F-15EX has only 'a limited capability to employ precision-guided, air-to-surface munitions.' With that in mind, the DOT&E report outlines the results of tests that assessed the F-15EX primarily against the kinds of threats it might encounter in the air-to-air part of its mission set. Here, the Eagle II appears to have passed with flying colors. 'Against the level of threat tested, the F-15EX is operationally effective in all its air superiority roles, including defensive and offensive counter-air against surrogate fifth-generation adversary aircraft, as well as basic air-to-ground capability against the tested threats,' the report notes. The reference to the F-15EX’s effectiveness against fifth-generation threats is especially notable. While it's unclear exactly what kinds of threats are being referred to, a fifth-generation fighter will typically have a low-observable design, advanced 'sensor fused' avionics, and generally high performance, among other attributes. Prior to the F-35, the fifth-generation rubric often included extreme agility and supercruise, but definitions for generations of fighters are highly subjective and change with the times. You can read more about this reality here. An F-15EX undergoes testing at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. Jamie Hunter Jamie Hunter Critics of the F-15EX have, in the past, suggested that the aircraft would not be able to compete on level terms with fifth-generation types, since it’s after all a heavily upgraded fourth-generation design, the first prototype of which flew in 1972. Regardless, the report seems to put such concerns aside, at least in the air-to-air arena, and based on the currently available test data. Furthermore, 'The F-15EX was able to detect and track all threats at advantageous ranges, use onboard and off-board systems to identify them, and deliver weapons while surviving,' the report continues. While it has clearly excelled in simulated air-to-air combat, the F-15EX also wins plaudits from the Pentagon on account of meeting 'all its reliability, availability, and maintainability requirements,' and achieving 'nearly all objectives although maintenance technical orders were still immature.' This is a huge achievement as the reliability of modern fighters has become nearly as big of a concern as their basic capabilities, with fifth-generation types struggling in this regard. Compared with the ‘legacy’ Eagle, the F-15EX boasts a much-enhanced cockpit, including a large touchscreen display, which you can read more about here. The crew are each provided with Digital Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing Systems (D-JHMCS). The cockpit of an F-15 with the new Large Area Display and low-profile head-up display. Boeing The cockpit environment is singled out for praise in the report, with survey data assessing human-systems interactions indicating that the pilots had positive opinions of F-15EX cockpit usability. However, the report does highlight some potential concerns that were raised during the initial operational test & evaluation (IOT&E). Here, the Pentagon notes that, while adequate for the current F-15EX mission set, the threat level was not representative of some of the kinds of higher-end threats that the aircraft may encounter in the future. 'The mission-level testing did not include some advanced, longer-range threat weapons becoming operational at the time of F-15EX fielding.' As a result, the report continues, follow-on testing will be required 'to assess the system against higher threat levels in more complex mission scenarios.'

(U.S. Air Force photo by Tech. Sgt. John Raven) More details weren’t provided, although the 'advanced, longer-range threat weapons' would appear to be a reference to one or more of the new Chinese air-to-air missiles currently coming online or poised to do so. China is known to be working on further-reaching air-to-air missiles, including the big PL-17, a very long-range missile that may well be intended primarily to target high-value assets, like tankers and airborne early warning aircraft. You can read more about this still-mysterious missile here. A Chinese J-16 fighter armed with the very long-range PL-17 missile. Chinese Internet As well as the more specialized PL-17, there is also another new Chinese air-to-air missile, currently dubbed PL-16, the design of which seems to have been driven by the requirement for the Chinese J-20 stealth fighter to accommodate six longer-range missiles internally. In the past, Douglas Barrie, the Senior Fellow for Military Aerospace at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) think-tank told TWZ that the PL-16 will likely feature 'an active electronically scanned front end, Mach 5-plus fly-out, a lot of very capable onboard software, and be very resistant to jamming.' There’s no doubt that China is making rapid progress in air-to-air missiles, with even the relatively well-established PL-15 thought to out-range the U.S.-made AIM-120C/D AMRAAM series. Indeed, the Air Force has publicly said that the emergence of the PL-15 was a key factor in the decision to start the AIM-260 program to provide a longer-range AMRAAM successor. Four dummy PL-15 missiles in the weapons bay of a J-20. Chinese Internet It's notable, too, that the F-15EX has also been earmarked as a potential platform for the carriage of new and larger long-range air-to-air missiles, as you can read about here. The report points out that some of the difficulty in obtaining the required test data for the F-15EX has resulted from the limitations in existing open-air range infrastructure. This is something that will only become more acute as missile ranges increase — not to mention the need to conduct these kinds of tests away from the prying eyes of potential adversaries. With this in mind, the F-15EX test campaign may, in the future, make use of the Joint Simulation Environment (JSE). This is a facility offering a so-called 'software battlespace environment,' for testing and training that cannot currently be conducted on the Pentagon’s major physical test and training ranges. An artist’s rendering showcases a Joint Simulation Environment station. U.S. Air Force graphic illustration courtesy of 412th Electronic Warfare Group With the F-15EX now in Air Force service, the generally highly positive results of its operational testing thus far will be a significant confidence boost for the service and for manufacturer Boeing. Time will tell how the F-15EX copes with the kinds of 'advanced, longer-range threat weapons' that it hasn’t currently been pitted against in test simulations. But provided it continues to excel, this could be another strong argument for the Air Force looking to acquire more than the 98 F-15EX aircraft that it now plans to buy.

Navy Develops Highly Persistent Undersea Hydrophone System Powere...	The Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) has helped develop an autonomous underwater float that can monitor and transmit oceanographic and underwater acoustic data near-indefinitely, and in near real-time. Known as the Persistent Smart Acoustic Profiler (PSAP) Voyager, it is powered by temperature differences in the ocean, providing enough energy to run its instrumentation for far longer than other non-wired undersea eavesdropping hydrophones currently in operation. Such an innovation could have big implications for undersea sensing and detection. Capabilities like PSAP Voyager could prove doubly useful if operationalized for tactical means at a time when the U.S. Navy fleet is being eclipsed by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN). Providing a highly flexible and rapidly deployable hydrophone system that can persist for long periods without any infrastructure could prove invaluable in this context. The Navy announced PSAP Voyager’s milestone this week. Neither the service nor Seatrec, the manufacturer, responded to questions about the drone by TWZ’s deadline Thursday. Researchers prepare the Persistent Smart Acoustic Profiler (PSAP) Voyager for initial testing in Monterey Bay, California, in a photo released by the Navy this month. (Seatrec) PSAP Voyager generates enough electricity via 'ocean energy thermal conversion' to power onboard computing capabilities for processing the reams of data picked up by its passive acoustics, according to the company, which partnered with NPS in 2022 for the Voyager effort. 'The new PSAP Voyager’s ability to generate power leapfrogs previous generations of autonomous profiling floats that are limited by battery power and enables acoustic data to be collected in real time anywhere in the world’s oceans nearly indefinitely,' the company said last month. PSAP Voyager testing off Hawaii late last year delivered troves of oceanographic and passive acoustic data that NPS undersea warfare, meteorology and oceanography students are now combing through, according to the school. The Navy’s announcement did not say whether Voyager will be put into operational use anytime soon. It remains unclear whether the Navy’s underwater monitoring force already relies on such thermal power conversion for any of its systems, and the silent service is generally secretive about its capabilities. Seatrec’s website indicates that it is working on projects for harvesting thermal energy for 'low power Arctic sensors and data communications' for the Office of Naval Research (ONR), as well as long-endurance, fast-profiling floats for the Pentagon’s futuristic Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Researchers test the Persistent Smart Acoustic Profiler (PSAP) Voyager off Monterey Bay earlier this month. (Seatrec) A system like PSAP Voyager could be of big help to the undersea warfare community when it comes to persistent underwater surveillance. While it remains unclear precisely how far the PSAP Voyager can transmit its data or how it does so at all, crews could conceivably drop off a hydrophone at various locations, allowing the Navy to monitor underwater activity without a ship, submarine, or drone having to tend to the system regularly or without elaborate infrastructure on the seafloor. 'Passive acoustic listening has many operational and research applications in the Navy,' John Joseph, the principal investigator and faculty associate for research at the NPS, said in a statement last month. 'The autonomy and long endurance of Seatrec’s PSAP Voyager provides an unprecedented opportunity to collect acoustic data in real-time for very long periods in remote areas without the expense and logistical tail of ship support.' Traditional hydrophones are positioned in a towed array and dragged by a submarine or surface ship through the water. Others are situated at depth by a ship, or are placed on the seafloor and connected via fiber optic cable to ashore stations. But such deployments require dedicated vessels and other infrastructure to carry maintain those missions. A Navy rendering of its Surveillance Towed Array Sensor System (SURTASS), used to detect and track submarines at long ranges, primarily by deploying a towed array of hydrophones behind a surface ship. (U.S. Navy) 'Theoretically, PSAP can be deployed once, communicate its acoustic information to remote operators in near real time for limitless periods without requiring retrieval to offload data … swapping batteries or data storage, or replacement,' Joseph said. 'These characteristics greatly reduce lifecycle costs of a continuous acoustic monitoring effort.' PSAP Voyager’s arrival comes as the Navy has in recent years poured money into unmanned undersea vehicles and buoys, as well as networked communications and data sharing infrastructure, to support enhanced monitoring of environmental changes in the Arctic. But aside from such scientific needs, similar systems could also help the Navy monitor adversaries in the increasingly strategic region. The Navy has also sought to develop other fixed, persistent, deep-water active anti-submarine surveillance systems. While the service has not provided many details about such efforts, the Affordable Mobile Anti-Submarine Warfare Surveillance System, (AMASS) would involve large sonar arrays attached to buoys that ships could drop in the ocean from inside a standard shipping container. A TWZ rendering of the Navy's assorted Arctic surveillance efforts. (TWZ.com) Go here to read TWZ’s reporting on those efforts, which have come as Navy brass continue to warn about increasing submarine activity from potential adversaries, particularly Russian subs operating more regularly off the East Coast of the United States. Meanwhile, China has in recent years also developed undersea sensor networks that Beijing says are for scientific purposes, but that could be used to track foreign submarine activity in the South China Sea and East China Sea. As previously reported by TWZ, the Chinese plan envisioned a number of unspecified sensors dwelling on the ocean floor. But unlike PSAP Voyager, those sensors were to be connected via optical cables to a monitoring and processing facility in Shanghai. The devices will be able to provide 'real-time, high-definition, multiple interface, and three-dimensional observations,' state-run outlet CCTV reported in 2019. The U.S. had its highly classified SOSUS network of hydrophones on the seafloor around the globe during the Cold War, with elements of the program now being used for scientific research. Similar modernized systems remain and operate under classified programs today. Regardless, the possibility that buoys based on PSAP Voyager's technology could help the Navy rapidly deploy persistent underwater listening networks wherever they are needed is clearly and highly promising proposition.

Trump Receives Golden Pager Gift From Netanyahu	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave U.S. President Donald Trump an unusual gift when he visited the White House. The Israeli leader presented Trump with a golden pager, according to published reports. The gift was meant to commemorate Israel's campaign targeting Hezbollah operatives through the use of thousands of explosive pagers and walkie-talkies. You can read more about that in our reporting here. 'The Prime Minister’s Office acknowledges that Benjamin Netanyahu gave a golden pager as a gift to US President Donald Trump during their meeting on Tuesday,' the Times of Israel reported Thursday morning. 'The gift ‘symbolizes the Prime Minister’s decision that led to a turning point in the war and the starting point for breaking the will of the terrorist organization Hezbollah,’ says Netanhayhu’s office.

Since returning to office, Trump has repeatedly vowed to support Israel and signed an Executive Order 'restoring maximum pressure on Iran.' On Tuesday, he shocked the world suggesting the U.S. will take over the war-torn Gaza Strip. 'I do see a long-term ownership position, and I see it bringing great stability to that part of the Middle East, and maybe the entire Middle East,' he said. 'We’re going to take over that piece and we’re going to develop it, create thousands and thousands of jobs. And it will be something that the entire Middle East can be very proud of.'

Massive Ordnance Penetrator Bunker Buster Grows More Potent Thank...	The U.S. Air Force quietly fixed a problem with the integration of the 30,000-pound class GBU-57/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) bomb onto the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber last year. This is especially significant given that the B-2 is the only aircraft currently certified to operationally employ the MOP, a huge precision bunker buster specially designed to penetrate very deeply buried and fortified targets. As part of the integration work, the service also conducted an important test of a new 'smart fuze' for the MOP to help improve the weapon's effectiveness, even when the exact depth and positioning of the buried target are not definitively known. The Pentagon's Office of the Director of Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) included an update on developments regarding MOP in its most recent annual report, which covers work on various programs conducted during Fiscal Year 2024. The exact size of the current MOP stockpile is unknown, but it is understood to be relatively small. As of 2015, prime contractor Boeing had delivered at least 20 of the bombs, according to the Air Force. There have been reports of additional orders over the years and a story from Bloomberg in 2024 said that a facility in Oklahoma was being expanded to help triple or even quadruple the annual output of these bombs. A GBU-57/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb. USAF The Air Force's stock of MOPs has been upgraded multiple times over the years already and at least five variants are known to exist, the latest of which is the GBU-57F/B. Also, while the B-2 is the only platform approved for employing the bombs operationally, B-52 bombers have dropped the bombs during tests. 'The Air Force conducted two full-scale tests in FY24 to verify fixes to a B-2 integration issue,' DOT&E's latest annual report, which was released last week, says. 'The second of the two full-scale test events also used the LPSF [Large Penetrator Smart Fuze] in a full-scale testbed.' A MOP mock-up sits inside a training device that simulates a B-2 bomb bay in 2007. USAF 'The Air Force established the LPSF Quick Reaction Capability program in August 2018 to respond to a validated urgent operational need, to integrate and qualify a smart fuze capability into the MOP that had been previously fielded as the Enhanced Threat Response [ETV] weapon modifications,' the report adds 'This upgrade, known as MOP Modification, provides the capability to hold at risk additional high-value HDBTs [hard and deeply buried targets] with limited threat intelligence.' When it comes to bunker bombs, especially when employed against subterranean targets, effectiveness is not just about hitting the right mark, but also about detonating at the most optimal moment after burrowing down into the ground. Available intelligence about the target's exact depth and general layout underground may be limited, as well. All of these issues are further magnified when it comes to the MOP, which is designed to penetrate especially deep, up to at least 200 feet (60 meters), according to publicly available data. A graphic showing the potential penetration capabilities of the MOP from very early in the program. This shows a 60-foot penetrating depth, shallower than the 200-foot capability that has been reported since. What the weapon’s capabilities are currently are unknown. DOD via GlobalSecurity.org What specific capabilities LPSF offers are unknown, but the U.S. military has publicly invested significant resources in the development of advanced void-sensing fuzes for smaller 2,000 and 5,000-pound class bunker buster bombs. A void-sensing fuze is designed to trigger when it detects a sufficiently large open space, such as a room in an underground facility. This can be further combined with a delay element to allow the bomb to break deeper into the target before detonating for maximum effect. A graphic from the Hard Target Void Sensing Fuze (HTVSF) program, which focused on the development of advanced fuzes for bunker buster bombs smaller than MOP. DOD LPSF could offer additional features to improve the overall effectiveness of the MOP. DOT&E's new report further highlights the challenges involved in testing new capabilities for the MOP even against subscale targets, let alone full-size threat representative ones. 'Due to program funding reprioritization, Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) contract challenges that affected the ability to construct targets to support testing, and modifications to the delivery platform, the MOP Modification program was unable to execute planned testing in FY21 and FY22,' per the report. 'The Air Force rescheduled the test events into FY23 and FY24.' A MOP test article in a tunnel at the U.S. Army's White Sands Missile Range in 2007. DOD 'Changes made by DTRA to expedite the contracting and test plan review process have resulted in no material headway, and delays continue. While significantly delayed, the program was able to execute testing at the end of FY23 and in FY24,' it continues. 'Despite the delays in test execution and reductions in subscale testing, the program is proceeding with key performance milestones.' 'Subscale lethality testing was reduced in scope (by approximately 50 percent) due to funding redirection from the Air Force and test execution cost growth within DTRA. The reduced subscale test effort concluded in September 2024,' the report adds. 'The DoD has limited test locations that allow for subscale and full-scale testbed construction, leading to high-demand and expensive, long-lead time, and custom-tailored testbed.' A MOP seen right before hitting the ground during a previous test. DOD The general value of having a non-nuclear, very deep-penetrating weapon like MOP in the U.S. military's arsenal is only increasing. America's near-peer competitors China and Russia continue to build new hardened and/or underground facilities, including bases with deep caverns for aircraft and submarines, which would be important to be able to hold at risk in the event that a high-end conflict erupts. Just last week, the Financial Times published a detailed report on a new 1,500-acre command center complex with a major subterranean component that the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) is building in the western end of the country's sprawling capital Beijing. 'China’s military is building a massive complex in western Beijing that US intelligence believes will serve as a wartime command centre far larger than the Pentagon…military experts assess will house large, hardened bunkers to protect Chinese military leaders during any conflict… pic.twitter.com/mCHGS946s9&mdash; Michael Sobolik (@michaelsobolik) January 30, 2025 Other smaller potential adversaries, especially Iran and North Korea, have been increasingly pushing critical facilities underground in no small part because of the threat of strikes from countries like the United States. A report from The Association Press in 2023 notably highlighted concerns that new underground additions to Iran’s Natanz nuclear site could be out of the reach of MOP. Last year, Israeli forces also conducted a dramatic commando raid that destroyed an underground missile production facility in Syria that had been built with Iranian assistance, which you can read about more here. That operation underscored the challenges of neutralizing these kinds of deeply buried and hardened sites and signaled, especially to Iran, Israel's willingness and ability to take such steps to do so. MOP, in combination with the stealth B-2, also gives the U.S. military a unique option for prosecuting deeply buried and hardened targets located in very heavily defended areas. The forthcoming B-21 Raider stealth bomber will offer even more capability in this regard. The Air Force has also been looking at adding new 5,000-pound class GBU-72/A bunker buster bombs to the B-2's arsenal in the meantime. The Pentagon explicitly highlighted all of this in a statement following B-2 strikes on 'hardened underground weapons storage locations in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen' last October, which stressed 'the United States’ ability to target facilities that our adversaries seek to keep out of reach, no matter how deeply buried underground, hardened, or fortified.' As TWZ noted at the time, the use of B-2s in this case was clearly meant to send signals beyond Yemen, particularly to Iran. All of this underscores the importance of the LPSF and other upgrades to the MOP, as well as ongoing testing to validate those improvements.

First Mirage 2000 Fighter Has Arrived In Ukraine	The first Dassault Mirage 2000 fighter for the Ukrainian Air Force has arrived in the country, according to statements from the defense ministries of France and Ukraine. With this development, Ukraine gets its second Western-made fighter type, following the arrival of the F-16, the first of which arrived in Ukraine last summer. In a statement on X today, the French Minister of the Armed Forces Sébastien Lecornu confirmed the arrival of the first Mirage 2000 in Ukraine. Lecornu recalled that French President Emmanuel Macron had announced plans to transfer an undisclosed number of the fighters to Ukraine, on June 6 last year, as TWZ reported at the time. Le 6 juin 2024, @EmmanuelMacron avait annoncé la livraison à l’Ukraine de Mirage 2000 français.Les premiers d’entre eux sont arrivés aujourd’hui en Ukraine.Avec à leur bord les pilotes ukrainiens formés pendant plusieurs mois en France, ils participeront désormais à défendre…&mdash; Sébastien Lecornu (@SebLecornu) February 6, 2025 'With Ukrainian pilots trained for several months in France on board, they will now be helping to defend the skies over Ukraine,' Lecornu added.

France had also announced that the aircraft would receive new air-to-ground capabilities ahead of the deliveries. The undisclosed modifications that will allow them to fly air-to-ground missions are being carried out at Cazaux in southwest France, alongside the introduction of new electronic self-defense equipment. When rumors of secondhand Mirage 2000s being provided to Ukraine first emerged, it was unclear if the aircraft in question were the more modern Mirage 2000-5F versions currently operated by France, or the older Mirage 2000C variants, the last of which were retired in June 2022, as you can read about here. A French Mirage 2000-5F prepares to receive fuel from a tanker. U.S. Department of Defense U.S. Air Force photo by Staff Sgt. Devin M. Rumbaugh Macron later referred specifically to the transfer of the Mirage 2000-5 version, suggesting that the airframes could have been sourced from Greece, Qatar, or even Taiwan — given the timeline, among other factors, this seems unlikely. On the other hand, until we have substantial photographic or video evidence of the aircraft in question, we likely won’t know for sure the identity of their original operator. Meanwhile, most reports point to the Mirage 2000-5F version, around 30 of which are currently available, based at Luxeuil in France, with a detachment in Djibouti on the Horn of Africa. The French-operated Mirage 2000-5F fleet was converted from existing Mirage 2000Cs, but emerged as far more capable jets, although they were almost entirely restricted to air-to-air operations, at least in their basic form. A French Mirage 2000C, ahead of the type’s retirement. Paul Crouch/RAF Brize Norton Photographic Section Crown Copyright The key features of the Mirage 2000-5F include a mechanically scanned pulse-Doppler radar, known as the RDY, which has a look-down/shoot-down capability. The radar can track up to eight targets simultaneously and also has some air-to-ground functionality. The new radar is combined with a much-modernized cockpit, including three multifunction color displays. In its standard air defense ‘fit,’ the Mirage 2000-5F is primarily armed with the MICA family of beyond-visual-range air-to-air missiles, which can be fitted with either radar-homing or infrared seeker heads. The MICA, which is also available in ground-launched form, is a missile type that has so far not been provided to Ukraine. Perhaps most intriguing is the Mirage’s new air-to-ground capability. We don’t yet know what types of offensive munitions will be added after the upgrade work, although we have previously noted the two most obvious candidates. The first of these is the stealthy SCALP-EG cruise missile, which has been integrated on other Mirage 2000 versions and which is already used by Ukrainian Su-24 Fencer strike aircraft. A French-supplied SCALP-EG cruise missile under the wing of a Ukrainian Su-24 Fencer strike aircraft. Ukrainian Ministry of Defense screencap The other notable option is the Hammer rocket-assisted precision-guided bomb. While the Hammer is not known to have been integrated on the Mirage 2000 previously, the French-made weapon is also used by Ukraine, with France having promised to deliver significant numbers, initially for use on Soviet-era combat aircraft.

Ukrainian Air Force screencap Ukrainian Air Force screencap Also interesting is the new electronic self-defense system that’s being integrated into the Mirages. Again, as we have discussed in the past, one possibility is the ICMS Mk 2 system, which is already used on export Mirage 2000-5s. This is a fully internal suite that includes radar warning receivers, jammers, and chaff and flare dispensers, meaning that external stores stations remain available for weapons and fuel tanks. More advanced still is the ICMS Mk 3, a fully digital electronic self-defense system, used on the Mirage 2000-9 export version. Whatever the equipment, it’s notable that the Mirages — like the Ukrainian F-16s — are being provided with a more robust electronic warfare suite, a reflection of the extremely high level of risk posed by Russian air defense systems anywhere close to the front lines. How quickly Ukraine might be able to use the Mirage in combat will depend primarily upon the level of training that the pilots and mechanics have received. Reports in the French media state that the country has agreed to train an initial 26 Ukrainian pilots and the first cohort completed Alpha Jet training in France last September.

Photo by Christophe ARCHAMBAULT / AFP CHRISTOPHE ARCHAMBAULT While the F-16 seems to have been introduced to combat primarily in an air defense capacity, especially in the defense of cities and infrastructure against Russian drone and cruise missile attacks, the Mirage might be first employed for strike missions. After all, Ukrainian personnel are already familiar with the SCALP-EG and Hammer munitions, and the latter, at least, has been made available in very significant numbers.

This has impacted the timeline for the handover of F-16s promised by Belgium, specifically. The Belgian government had hoped to deliver the first batch of F-16s to Ukraine by the end of 20254, but this has been held up by a lack of trained Ukrainian pilots and spare parts, according to the Belgian Ministry of Defense. Today it was reported that a batch of former Dutch F-16s had also arrived in Ukraine. These may well be the first from this source to touch down in the country, as opposed to going to the training center in Romania.

As regards other Western fighters, the long-discussed plan to transfer Swedish Gripen C/D jets is still apparently on the table. There was confirmation today from the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Oleksandr Syrskyi, that talks are ongoing.

While we wait to see the first imagery of the Mirages in Ukraine, as well as the first reports of operational sorties, today’s development provides a much-needed boost to the country’s air defense and standoff strike capabilities.

Ukrainian Minerals For Arms Deal Complicated By Russian Control O...	Both U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky say they are interested in a deal that would swap American arms for Ukrainian minerals. While Ukraine has trillions of dollars worth of minerals, including lithium and titanium, any such deal would have to overcome the fact that a lot of those resources exist is in territory captured by Russia or too close to the front lines to mine. 'I want to have security of rare earths,' Trump told reporters in the Oval Office earlier this week. 'We're putting in hundreds of billions of dollars. They have great rare earths. And I want security of the rare earths, and they're willing to do it.' Trump's interest is spurred by the vast amount of such resources China possesses. REPORTER: What you said about Ukraine earlier — the rare earth. Do you want them to give the rare earth to the United States?TRUMP: Yeah pic.twitter.com/LdTT5H7Yri&mdash; Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) February 3, 2025 What Trump meant by 'rare earths and other things' remains unclear. Ukraine has deposits of 20 of the world’s critical minerals and metals like titanium and lithium, the Kyiv Independent reported. Titanium is used in the aerospace and defense industries and lithium is an essential component of microchips and electric vehicle batteries. 'Ukraine also possesses rare earth elements — under which titanium and lithium do not fall — such as cerium, yttrium, lanthanum, and neodymium,' the publication stated. 'Demand for these materials has jumped in recent years as the world shifts to renewable forms of energy. Rare earth elements are crucial for making the powerful magnets used in wind turbine generators.' The Russian Federation has taken control of up to 70 per cent of Ukraine's minerals: the most minerals are in Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk and Luhansk regions, Forbes has calculatedTheir value is $15 trillion. pic.twitter.com/iItfAO0Nhl&mdash; Clash Report (@clashreport) February 4, 2025 Having floated the idea to U.S. officials last year, Zelensky said it would be 'fair' to give U.S. companies access to the minerals as Washington has helped Kyiv fend off Russian forces, according to the Kyiv Post. 'I would like U.S. business&#8230; to develop this field here,' Zelensky said, according to comments published by his office. 'We are open to the fact that all this can be developed with our partners, who are both helping us to protect our land and pushing the enemy back with their weapons, and sanctions packages — and this is absolutely fair.' Ukraine is ready to mine rare earth metals together with partners, - Zelensky.'Allies help protect our land, push the enemy back with their weapons, presence, sanctions.

'If we call things as they are, this is a proposal to buy help — in other words, not to give it unconditionally, or for some other reasons, but specifically to provide it on a commercial basis,' Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters Tuesday. 'It would be better of course for the assistance to not be provided at all, as that would contribute to the end of this conflict,' he added. Dmitry Peskov's objection to Trump's proposal reflects the classic Russian refrain that if NATO countries stopped arming Ukraine, the war would endSo its entirely expected rhetoric Samuel Ramani (@SamRamani2) February 4, 2025 Wanting a deal is one thing, but getting access to some of the minerals will prove challenging. ​​A little more than half of Ukraine's mineral resources, valued at over $7.5 trillion, are contained in the four regions Russian President Vladimir Putin illegally annexed in September 2022, and of which his army occupies a considerable swathe, The Independent reported on Wednesday. That includes Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, though Kherson holds little value in terms of minerals, the publication added. The Crimean peninsula, annexed and occupied by Russian forces in 2014, also holds roughly £206 billion (about $258 billion) worth of minerals. Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, which borders the largely occupied regions of Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia and is threatened by the advancing Russian army, 'contains an additional $3.5 trillion in mineral resources,' The Independent explained. Infographic showing Ukraine, the territory under Russian control as of February 4, 1830 GMT, and the approximate locations of Ukrainian reserves of selected minerals: graphite, lithium, titanium, zirconium and rare earth metals (Photo by Sylvie HUSSON and Sabrina BLANCHARD / AFP) SYLVIE HUSSON; SABRINA BLANCHARD Not only is a huge amount of Ukraine's mineral resources in Russian hands, a lot of it is so close to the front lines that mining, processing and transporting it would be virtually impossible. For example, a major lithium reserve 'is within 10 miles of the front line in the Donetsk region,' The Washington Post noted. 'Analysts have estimated that Moscow has already managed to seize control of more than $12 trillion worth of Ukrainian energy assets, metals and minerals.' Given all the challenges, this is a deal that may never come to pass. If it does, however, it could greatly benefit both countries. The Latest Russian efforts to advance on several towns in the Donetsk region have been temporarily blunted, while the pace of fighting is picking up in Luhansk Oblast. Here are some of the key takeaways from the latest Institute for the Study of War (ISW) assessment. Kursk: Russian forces continued offensive operations in the Ukrainian salient in Kursk Oblast on February 4 but did not make any confirmed advances. Kharkiv: Russian forces continued limited ground attacks toward Kharkiv City on February 4 but did not advance. Luhansk: Russian forces advanced toward Kupyansk on February 4. They attacked near Lyman, but did not advance. Donetsk: Russian forces tried to push toward Chasiv Yar, Toretsk, Pokrovsk, Siversk, Kurakhove and Velyka Novosilka but did not make confirmed advances. Zaporizhzhia: Russian forces continued limited ground attacks in the Dnipro direction immediately east of Kherson City near Antonivka and Prydniprovske on February 3 and 4 but did not advance.

That assessment is in contrast to what the head of Ukraine’s spy agency told us last week. 'The National Intelligence Service (NIS) disclosed the intelligence, confirming a recent report from The New York Times that North Korean soldiers who fought alongside Russian troops in battle against Ukraine have been pulled from the front lines in mid-January due to heavy casualties citing Ukrainian and U.S. officials,' the South Korean Yonhap News Agency wrote on Tuesday. 'The spy agency echoed the news report, saying that heavy casualties appear to be one reason for the absence of North Korean troops, adding that efforts are underway to determine the exact reason.' Last week, Lt. General Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR), told us that there were still about 8,000 North Korean troops on the front and that they were still fighting. At the time, he called reports about their withdrawal from the front lines 'wrong.' On Wednesday, Budanov told us that his assessment is still different than what was reported by the Times, but it has been updated. There are now fewer than 4,000 troops there, he told us, but are no longer fighting. 'We don’t see a full withdrawal of North Korean troops,' Budanov told us, adding that GUR is conducting further assessments of the situation. 'They are not conducting any infantry operations right now, but they are regrouping.' BREAKING: South Korean intelligence confirms the temporary withdrawal of North Korean forces from Kursk frontlines&mdash; Samuel Ramani (@SamRamani2) February 4, 2025 Zelensky made a rare acknowledgment that Russia will likely hold onto land it has seized, at least in the near term. 'We cannot return all our territories,' Zelensky told broadcaster Piers Morgan in a wide-ranging interview released Tuesday. 'We have adequate people. We cannot lose millions of people for the result that - and it is not yet clear - that it will happen as of today.' While seemingly resigned to the fact that Russian forces won’t be dislodged anytime soon from the 20 percent of Ukraine it now occupies, Zelensky said that 'we will never recognize these territories as Russian.' 'This is not the question of a compromise or non-compromise,' he added. 'There can be no compromise in the sovereignty of the state.' Zelensky once again complained about a lack of support from allies, saying it was 'insufficient for us to push Putin fully out of our territories. However, through a combination of military action and diplomacy, 'we will bring back our land because we are right and we did not violate any aspect of international law and morally anyway, we are absolutely right in this situation.' When asked by Morgan if he could sit down with Putin 'given how you feel about him,' Zelensky answered that he would as part of a four-party negotiation involving the warring countries, the U.S. and European Union. 'If that is the only setup in which we can bring peace to the citizens of Ukraine and not lose people, definitely, we will go for this setup for the meeting with these four participants,' he said. 'Does it matter what is my attitude to him? I will not be kind to him. And I believe that I considered him an enemy. And to be honest, I believe he considered me an enemy as well.' Zelensky also broached the topic of nuclear weapons, rhetorically asking whether they would be provided to Ukraine. 'If the process of Ukraine joining NATO is taking a decade not because of us, but because of our partners, then we have a legitimate question: what will protect us from this evil?' he queried.

The move involves about 50,000 troops or roughly 20% of those on the front lines. The 'sweeping reform' to replace the Ukrainian Armed Forces (AFU) 'often-haphazard regional command structure into a modern warfighting machine' was ordered by commanding general Oleksandry Syrsky on Monday,' the Kyiv Post reported on Tuesday. Syrsky announced that the Ukrainian army 'will convert its frontline formations into corps-sized command groups built around some of the AFU’s most effective combat brigades.' Initial orders for the restructuring had gone out and 'a reported six corps headquarters would take over direct control of sectors of the front, and that each would be assigned five combat brigades, on paper giving each corps formation a front-line strength of 12-15,000 men and around 700-900 heavy weapons like tanks, armored personnel carriers or artillery,' according to the Kyiv Post. 'Ukrainian military media on Tuesday confirmed initial orders for the restructuring had gone out and a reported six corps headquarters would take over direct control of sectors of the front, and that each would be assigned five combat brigades' Michael Kofman (@KofmanMichael) February 5, 2025 In his evening television address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the deep changes to AFU headquarters structure and fighting unit chains of command would improve combat efficiency and make possible rotations of units to rear areas for rest and recuperation. Those troops are sometimes deployed to the fighting line for more than a year, the publication noted. 'A common and longstanding complaint by Ukrainian frontline commanders and troops is a three-year-old AFU policy of juggling hundreds of small units in and out of deployments along a 1,000-kilometer-long (621-mile-long) front, without a centralized local command,' the Kyiv Post explained. A large motivation for the reorganization is that there is minimal replenishment of units from the training centers, according to Ukrainian Pravda (UP). The publication, citing a Ukrainian military source, added that this move is not related to potential negotiations or freeze of the front lines. 'He said the Ukrainian army would be able to carry out rotations in the face of a major war,' UP stated.

According to a flight-tracking website, the jet took off from RAF Mildenhall and flew about 200 miles southeast of Ukraine, doing several orbits over the Black Sea between occupied Crimea and Turkey. Those orbits would allow the spy plane to gather information about Russian radar, and communications over all of Crimea and parts of Kherson Oblast and southeastern Russia, X user @MeNMyRC1 whose bio includes being a former Rivet Joint crewmember, told us. 'The orbit over the Black Sea gives them much more range than they had flying solely over Romania,' said @MeNMyRC1. While this was reportedly the first USAF Rivet Joint flight over the Black Sea in nearly three years, jets operated by the U.K. Royal Air Force have flown over the body of water since.

'We (Russians) have a general problem with organizing any proactive combat work on specific tasks on a systematic basis,' said the milblogger. 'A sad systematicity is observed in the practice of poorly organized attacks, which, due to some misunderstanding, are considered offensive actions.)' Another big problem is that Ukraine has a large advantage in the number of drones on the battlefield.

New Details About T-7A Red Hawk Jet Trainer Ejection System Woes ...	New information about serious and potentially dangerous deficiencies with the emergency ejection system on the U.S. Air Force's new T-7A Red Hawk jet trainer has been released. Environmental testing of the Red Hawk last year also exposed new problems that need to be addressed. The Air Force has been working with manufacturer Boeing to fix or otherwise mitigate a host of issues with the T-7A, which have already led to significant delays and prompted a recent shakeup of the overall plans for the program. The Pentagon's Office of the Director of Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) provided new updates on T-7A program in its most recent annual report, which it released last week. The report covers work done on various programs during Fiscal Year 2024, which ended on September 30 of last year. TWZ has reached out to the Air Force and Boeing for any information on additional developments since then related to the Red Hawk's ejection system, the problems uncovered in the environmental testing, and other issues. You can read more about what has previously been disclosed about T-7A testing in this recent TWZ feature. The T-7A flew for the first time in 2023 and, as of December 2024, the Air Force had taken delivery of five pre-production test jets. The final T-7A #RedHawk engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) jet, APT-5, has been delivered to the @USAirForce.Check out all fab five T-7A EMD jets taking off! pic.twitter.com/BVYQLvPxGW&mdash; Boeing Defense (@BoeingDefense) December 20, 2024 Regardless, what DOT&E's newest report has disclosed now is concerning. 'As reported in the FY22 and FY23 Annual Reports, the T-7A emergency escape system does not meet minimum safety requirements for the Air Force’s airworthiness certification and is currently operating with high-risk acceptance for air worthiness,' according to DOT&E. 'A February 2024 sled test showed improvement at medium-speed ejections for the ejection seat sequencing.' However, 'the program executed a high-speed test in June 2024 where the seat sequenced correctly, but a seat hose interfered with the seat sequencer switch, which could lead to an incorrect ejection mode,' the new report adds. 'In the same test, the redesigned canopy fracturing system pattern did not function properly. The program must successfully complete seven more sled tests before the escape system can be certified for airworthiness and IOT&E [initial operational test and evaluation].' The two-seat T-7A features ACES 5 ejection seats from Collins Aerospace, a subsidiary of Raytheon (now formally called RTX). Previous testing had uncovered problems with the complete emergency egress system that presented serious safety risks, especially for smaller and lighter female pilots, and during ejections at speeds under 250 knots. As DOT&E notes in its latest report, work has already been ongoing to address these deficiencies, which have been a key driver in delays to date. 'In February 2024, the program completed initial cold and hot weather testing at the McKinley Climatic Laboratory in Eglin, Florida. This initial round of testing revealed several problems that require a second test event at the McKinley Laboratory in 3QFY25 [third quarter Fiscal Year 2025, which begins in April],' DOT&E has also now disclosed. The report does not provide any specific details about the problems encountered in the environmental testing. The Air Force did publicly announce the environmental testing at McKinley last year and said one of the T-7As had been subjected to temperatures as low as negative 25 degrees and as high as 110 degrees, both in Fahrenheit, as well as extreme humidity. The service made no mention of any problems at that time. The T-7A undergoing hot temperature testing at the McKinley Climatic Laboratory. USAF Samuel King Jr. The T-7A seen frozen during the cold temperature portion of the environmental testing at the McKinley Climatic Laboratory. USAF Samuel King Jr. Other additional issues have been dogging the T-7A, but efforts continue to address or mitigate them. 'The [Red Hawk] program office also continued to make progress on the T-7A OBOGS [On-Board Oxygen Generation System]. The draft T-7A OBOGS test plan calls for 46 data points collected over 10 ground and 100 hours of flight test events, including high and sustained-g maneuvering,' DOT&E's new report says. 'The integrated test team will continue to collect OBOGS test data during future IOT&E, as system components age and approach regularly scheduled maintenance and replacement. DOT&E will evaluate OBOGS performance in accordance with the current military standards document (MIL-STD-3050A), which incorporates lessons learned from several fighter aircraft mishaps.' As alluded to here, several U.S. military aircraft types have suffered from OBOGS-linked issues in recent years, some which have contributed to fatal mishaps, as TWZ has covered extensively in the past. 'AGCAS [Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System] is another known suitability limitation [for the T-7A]. Fighter aircraft employ AGCAS to prevent loss of life during sustained high-g maneuvers, which can cause the pilot to lose consciousness,' according to DOT&E. 'While the formal requirements for APT [the Advanced Pilot Training program] did not include AGCAS, the program office is developing a strategy to start AGCAS integration in FY26.' Furthermore, 'the majority of test points in the government DT [developmental test] test plan remain untested. These events include structural loads, subsystems, tanker formation, crew systems, On-Board Oxygen Generation System (OBOGS), mission systems, and high angle-of-attack testing, which have the potential to drive further software and flight control changes,' DOT&E highlights in latest report. That being said, 'the program appears to have a clear pathway to resolving known effectiveness issues, such as limited sortie duration and flight characteristics at high angles-of-attack.' One of the pre-production T-7As. USAF USAF In 2021, Boeing said it resolved an issue involving wing-rock at high angles of attack, in part through the use of digital engineering processes. DOT&E's report indicates that additional testing was still needed to validate that fix as of the end of Fiscal Year 2024. It's also worth noting here that the T-7A has been a poster child for the benefits of digital engineering and design tools, which Boeing has notably touted as making it easier to address issues uncovered during developmental testing. However, a significant consensus has emerged that these technologies have not shown themselves to be as revolutionary as hoped, as you can read more about here. Whether or not the issues highlighted in DOT&E latest report had been further addressed or mitigated in any way in the past four months, the T-7A program is already substantially delayed. The Air Force had hoped to reach initial operational capability with the Red Hawk in 2024, but that has now slipped to 2028. The service does not now even expect to order its first production T-7As until 2026. Earlier this month, the Air Force announced major changes to the overall T-7A program plan, including its intention to purchase four more pre-production examples to support ongoing testing. Boeing has also been using two demonstrator aircraft to support work on the Red Hawk. The demonstrators were originally built as part of the company's winning submission for the T-X jet trainer competition. A pre-production T-7A, at rear, flies together with one of the T-X demonstrators, at front. USAF Christian Turner 'Procuring these PRTVs [Production Representative Test Vehicles] in FY25 also allows the Air Force and Boeing to improve manufacturing readiness prior to entering the production phase for the entire run of over 350 T-7As,' Andrew Hunter, then-Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, said in a statement on January 15. 'Decreasing overlap between development, testing, and production lowers the likelihood of potential costly retrofits of a significant number of aircraft.' All of this presents serious concerns for the Air Force's already strained pilot training pipelines. The T-7As are in line to replace the service's T-38 Talon jet trainers, the core design of which dates back to the 1960s and that are only becoming harder and harder to sustain. Problems with the T-7A program, for which Boeing has a fixed-price contract, have led to financial trouble for the company, as well. Earlier this month, Boeing announced that its Defense, Space & Security division had suffered another $500 million loss on T-7A tied, at least in part, to higher-than-expected costs associated with the planned start of production in 2026. The company has previously reported more than a billion dollars in losses on the program since winning the Air Force's T-X jet trainer competition in 2018. 'Air Education and Training Command is actively working with our acquisitions partners to develop cutting edge training capabilities at the speed of need,' Air Force Lt. Gen. Brian S. Robinson, head of the Air Force's top training command, said in January around the announcement of the Red Hawk program restructuring. 'The T-7A will propel the Air Force’s pilot training pipeline into the future of aviation, enabling the Air Force to continue producing world-class pilots who meet the challenges of the future.' No matter what the current state of the T-7A's emergency ejection system is or what other work has been done since the end of Fiscal Year 2024, more work is clearly still needed before pilot trainees can start using the Red Hawks to get their wings.

Airbus A321 Airliners To Be Modified Into 'Flying Frigate' Patrol...	Airbus Defense and Space has begun a risk-assessment study for France’s future maritime patrol aircraft (MPA), to be based on an Airbus A321 airliner platform. Billed as a 'flying frigate' by the company, the new MPA is intended to replace the French Navy’s Dassault Atlantique 2 fleet but emerges at a time when NATO nations are increasingly adopting the in-production Boeing P-8 Poseidon for their maritime patrol requirements. Airbus yesterday announced a contract for further risk-reduction studies of the new maritime patrol aircraft. The contract was awarded by the Direction Générale de l’Armement (DGA), France’s defense procurement agency, with Airbus Defense and Space as prime contractor, in partnership with European defense corporation Thales. The contract runs for two years and follows a previous architecture and feasibility study launched at the end of 2022. The new A321 MPA will be based on the long-range A321XLR version of the airliner. The prototype is seen here in Hamburg, Germany. MarcelX42/Wikimedia Commons The latest contract is intended to prepare for the full-scale development of a new MPA that could start at the end of 2026, followed by the production launch. It will involve the first wind tunnel tests as well as work out technical specifications, so the various onboard systems can be chosen. It will also look at the economic and industrial conditions involved in the program. Significantly, the latest study specifies a maritime patrol variant of the A321XLR airliner, known as the A321 MPA. The earlier study had looked at building an MPA version of either an unspecified version of the A320 family or the Dassault Falcon 10X business jet An earlier Airbus concept for a multi-mission A320neo family, including an AEW&#038;C version with conformal radar arrays, a SIGINT platform, and a VIP jet. Airbus While Airbus had considered the shorter A320neo as a potential platform for a new MPA, the longer fuselage of the A321 means that it can accommodate additional fuel and a larger payload bay, as well as having an increased capacity for sensors and other mission systems. The basic A321XLR airliner has a range of 4,700 nautical miles (around 5,400 miles). 'The A321 MPA has all the assets to become a true flying frigate capable of responding to the wide range of missions entrusted to the French maritime patrol,' said Jean-Brice Dumont, Executive Vice President, Head of Air Power at Airbus Defense and Space, in a company statement. 'Airbus offers a sovereign solution that provides the autonomy, availability, and reliability required to contribute to the oceanic component of the nuclear deterrence.' Interestingly, Dumont referred specifically to one of the current Atlantique 2’s missions, namely protecting the French Navy’s nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) fleet as it heads out on patrol, or returns to its base, as a cornerstone of France’s strategic deterrent. The French Navy SSBN Le Terrible heads out on a patrol. Wmeinhart/Wikimedia Commons Other missions outlined for the A321 MPA at this stage include anti-submarine and anti-ship warfare, 'from low to high intensity,' as well as intelligence gathering. The turboprop-powered Atlantique 2 in service today was originally developed with anti-submarine warfare as its primary mission, but subsequently increasingly took on an anti-surface warfare role against enemy warships. More recently, it’s been mainly used for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and even strike missions overland. Indeed, embracing operations overland, including taking part in counter-insurgency campaigns in the Middle East and in West Africa, has been the most remarkable change in the Atlantique 2’s mission profile. A French Navy Atlantique 2 MPA. Dassault Aviation At this stage, however, the A321 MPA is being developed primarily for the overwater role, reflecting the return to prominence of anti-submarine warfare, as well as maritime patrol more generally, especially to counter Russian activities, conventional or otherwise. The mission equipment for the A321 MPA will be provided, to a significant degree, by Thales, and will include an active electronically scanned array (AESA) search radar and acoustic systems, including passive and active sonobuoys, for anti-submarine warfare. Like the Atlantique 2, it will also have a magnetic anomaly detector for acquiring submerged submarines. It will be fitted with self-protection equipment and satellite communications and will almost certainly also feature electronic support measures (ESM) to intercept radio-frequency transmissions. Triangular-shaped fairings scabbed on the side of the A321 MPA in the artist’s rendering at the top of this story may well contain ESM. The same rendering of the A321 MPA also shows a sensor turret below the forward fuselage. After various upgrades, the Atlantique 2 has two separate sensor turrets: a forward-looking infrared (FLIR) camera under the nose and an MX-20 turret that contains four different cameras and is primarily employed during overland missions, including for ISR. The MX-20 sensor turret under the rear fuselage of an Atlantique 2. Dassault Aviation 'The aircraft’s large cargo bay and the open architecture of its mission system give it a great capacity to evolve throughout its lifecycle to meet the emergence of new threats,' Airbus says of the A321 MPA. The weapons for the A321 MPA will include anti-submarine torpedoes as well as anti-ship missiles, some of which will be carried in the bay behind the wing, although wing pylons will likely also be provided. In particular, the aircraft is expected to be armed with the new anti-ship missile that’s being developed under the Future Cruise/Anti-Ship Weapon (FC/ASW) program that is run jointly by France, the United Kingdom, and Italy. FC/ASW plans to field two different missiles: a low-observable cruise missile and a highly maneuverable supersonic missile. While the former will replace the Storm Shadow/SCALP air-launched cruise missiles, the latter will be the successor to the Exocet and Harpoon anti-ship missiles and will arm the A321 MPA. An artist’s concept of the two missiles in the FC/ASW program: a low-observable cruise missile below, and the highly maneuverable supersonic anti-ship missile above. MBDA The Anti-Ship Weapon component of FC/ASW is expected to be a ramjet-powered missile, which will be much faster and more agile than previous-generation Western air-launched anti-ship missiles. Although being optimized to engage heavily defended naval targets, it’s also expected to have a secondary defense-suppression capability and there have even been indications it could have an air-to-air role for use against high-value airborne assets (HVAAs) at long ranges. At the same time, there may be potential for the A321 MPA to be armed with the new land-attack missile, too. The potential of aircraft in this class to provide useful additional long-range strike capacity, especially in the context of adversaries’ anti-access capabilities, is something TWZ has considered in the past. Notably, Airbus also points to the A321 MPA having a 'high-maneuverability capability, including at low altitude.' This seems to point to traditional concerns around using jet-powered aircraft for the MPA mission, rather than their slower- and lower-flying turboprop brethren, which are more efficient in this regime. The same issue applies to the P-8, which was also planned to prosecute underwater targets from high altitude. Previously, the P-8 had to drop down to release a standard Mk 54 torpedo, but it has now added the High-Altitude Anti-Submarine Warfare Weapon Capability (HAAWC) folding-wing kit to the same weapon, meaning it can also launch them from higher levels. It’s not clear if a similar solution will be developed for the A321 MPA. An artist’s conception of a HAAWC-equipped Mk 54 torpedo. Boeing Current plans call for the MPA to replace the French Navy’s fleet of aging Atlantique 2s sometime in the 2030s or 2040s. Currently, the French Navy has 18 Atlantique 2s upgraded to the latest Standard 6 configuration and, in the past, the service has said it will retain these until 2035. They are stationed at Lann-Bihoué naval air base in northern France. As for the A321, this has, so far, seen limited uptake for special-mission military applications. At one time, the A321 was envisaged as the platform for NATO’s Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS) system, which provides the alliance with reconnaissance capabilities, including synthetic aperture radar. However, this capability was eventually fielded on NATO’s fleet of five RQ-4D Phoenix uncrewed aerial vehicles, specialized versions of the Global Hawk. Early concept artwork showing an A321 equipped with NATO’s Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS) system. NATO Since then, India has selected the A321 as the platform for its future airborne early warning and control aircraft, the Netra Mk 2. Originally, it appeared that A320s would be chosen for this program, as you can read about here, but New Delhi eventually settled on the stretched fuselage, longer-range A321, buying six former Air India airframes for conversion. Returning to the MPA mission, the A321 MPA continues the French tradition of locally developing aircraft to meet this requirement. Ultimately, France pursued the Atlantique 2 alone and the aircraft failed to secure any export orders. Should full-scale development and production of the A321 MPA follow as planned, the aircraft will enter a very competitive marketplace in which the U.S.-made P-8 Poseidon appears to have already secured most of the obvious orders. In terms of NATO forces alone, the P-8 has been ordered by Canada, Germany, Norway, and the United Kingdom, and close ally Australia has been operating the Poseidon for years now. The fact that the German Navy opted for the U.S. product is a particular blow for France, which had previously been working with Germany on a joint program to develop a new MPA — the Maritime Airborne Warfare System (MAWS). Only yesterday, the German Ministry of Defense published photos of its first P-8 taking shape with Boeing in Seattle. The first P-8A for the German Navy. Boeing The first P-8A for German Marineflieger received its paintjob in Seattle, WA. Deliveries for eight aircraft on order are to start in August this year. Via Bundeswehr WhatsApp-channel (sigh).&mdash; Alex Luck (@alxluck.bsky.social) 2025-02-04T15:27:14.715Z The P-8 has also been ordered by India, New Zealand, and South Korea further reducing the potential MPA market share for the A321 MPA, which looks like it will offer a very similar set of capabilities. Perhaps France might have better luck offering the A321 MPA to potential customers in the Middle East where it has traditionally had a strong footprint. Meanwhile, there is a growing demand for maritime surveillance in the Asia Pacific region, particularly around the South China Sea. This strategically important waterway links the Indian and Pacific Oceans and China claims large swathes of it, leading to frequent tensions and standoffs. Here, Chinese submarine activity is a particular concern, as you can read about here. While the A320 family has been an undoubted success as an airliner, it remains to be seen whether the A321 MPA will achieve positive results. However, unless France also decides to buy the P-8 — which seems politically highly unlikely — there are few other obvious options to replace its hard-worked Atlantique 2 fleet.

USS Gerald R. Ford Was Still Struggling With Its Dual Band Radar ...	The dual-band radar (DBR) aboard the Navy aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78), the ship's primary sensor system, struggled to perform during a pre-deployment exercise and suffered failures as it grappled with the constant need for radar coverage. It remains unclear whether DBR's issues impacted Ford’s operations during its first full deployment, which began in May 2023 and was extended before ending in January 2024, but the Navy is now seeking to replace Ford's DBR entirely. These findings are part of the Pentagon's Director Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) annual report released last week. The document contains revelations regarding what the Navy will need to do to continue using the DBR, which was only installed aboard Ford and a truncated version of it exists in the three ships of the USS Zumwalt (DDG-1000) class. The full DBR suite was supposed to equip these ships before being scaled back significantly a decade ago, mainly due to cost concerns. In addition to DBR, the latest DOT&E report also offers fresh insights into the state of the Navy’s newest carrier, how it performed during deployment and the potential for rough seas ahead. (USN) (U.S. Navy) 'DBR availability declined during the FY23 [composite training unit exercise] with the continuous demand for radar coverage and an intermittent failure observed during operations,' the report states. Service officials did not respond to TWZ questions on the report’s findings by deadline, and this article will be updated when those answers come in. Prior DOT&E reports have blamed subpar DBR performance on 'the operational expectation of continuous radar coverage.' Due to DBR only being installed on the Ford and a version of it and its combat system on three Zumwalt class ships, supporting DBR and its assorted maintenance, software and upgrades is a pricey proposition for the Navy, which is very heavily invested in the proven Aegis Combat System and associated sensors. The Navy is also considering replacing Zumwalt’s radar with a SPY-6 variant and Aegis Combat System to help with sustainment and commonality across the fleet. The DOT&E notes both DBR's rarity and the challenges the Ford may face in keeping it up and running as it awaits the installation of a variant of the AN/SPY-6 radar. A rendering of how an AN/SPY-6 radar variant would look on a Ford class aircraft carrier. (Video screenshot/RTX) The specific version of the SPY-6 destined to supplant the DBR on Ford is a subvariant of what is also known as the Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar (EASR) and will include three separate fixed antenna arrays installed around the carrier's island instead of the DBR's six arrays. All subsequent Ford class carriers will be built with EASR, leaving just Ford as the only carrier ever have fielded the DBR. TWZ has previously unpacked the capabilities of the complete SPY-6 family, which currently includes four different variants, and the potential payoffs of fielding such an advanced and scalable active electronically scanned array radar system across the fleet. In addition to Ford class carriers, the Navy plans to install versions of the radar onto various new surface combatants, carriers and amphibious ships going forward, and plans are underway to back-fit it into existing destroyers as well. The various variants of SPY-6 radars. (RTX) It remains unclear precisely when the Ford will get EASR and the new DOT&E report warns that relying on the DBR until then will be challenging. For now, the Navy has asked manufacturer Raytheon to continue providing engineering efforts in support of the DBR program, Military + Aerospace Electronics reported in November. Raytheon did not respond to a TWZ request for comment on its DBR efforts by deadline Tuesday. The DOT&E report's data cutoff date was Oct. 1, 2024, and it remains unclear what progress, if any, has been made on correcting the ship's issues, including problems with the DBR, since then. 'Due to the one-of-a-kind nature of the DBR, its availability will depend on the Navy’s access to replacement parts throughout the remaining life of the system,' the DOT&E report states. 'The Navy should acquire sufficient DBR replacement parts for the interim period prior to the scheduled replacement of DBR with EASR.' DBR was billed as the service's first radar system capable of operating simultaneously on the S-band and X-band frequency ranges. It combines the functionality of the X-band AN/SPY-3 multifunction radar and the S-band SPY-4 volume search radar (VSR) for detecting and tracking targets. It and its underlying combat system was billed central nervous system of the Ford class. Sailors at work on the deck of the USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) in October. (U.S. Navy) But citing costs and the fact that it might be more radar than a carrier needed, given the capabilities of carrier strike group (CSG) destroyers and cruisers, the Navy opted to replace DBR back in 2016 Military Aerospace + Electronics’s John Keller reported. Continued reliability issues and it having zero commonality with the rest of the fleet were also huge concerns. Cost was also a factor, and officials said that moving to the EASR for the Ford class’s second carrier, the future USS John F. Kennedy (CVN-79), would save the service up to $120 million. The future aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy (CVN-79) under construction in 2019. (U.S. Navy) Even with last year’s extended deployment under its belt, the Ford continues to suffer a host of other problems across various ship systems beyond the DBR. Insufficient data has been gathered to determine the carrier’s operational effectiveness due to initial operation and testing evaluations remaining incomplete, according to the DOT&E. In some ways, the tardiness of Ford’s testing is to be expected, according to Bradley Martin, a retired Navy surface warfare officer and senior policy analyst at the RAND think tank. 'Many things about the Ford are unusual, and a starting point is that it was delivered late,' Martin told TWZ. The Ford was delivered in 2017, after roughly 15 months of delays. Its first cruise was pushed back several years as well. 'It’s not exactly that the Navy’s operational needs scuppered the testing cycle as much as the ship being delivered late meant that the operational schedule had already been perturbed,' he said. TWZ has extensively covered the trials and tribulations of the Ford over the years, and the DOT&E’s new report provides added insight into the struggles the Navy has long faced in fixing problems like advanced weapons elevators (AWE), subpar sortie generation rates, and other issues. At one point lawmakers derided the ship as little more than 'a $13-billion nuclear-powered floating berthing barge.' TWZ has also covered Ford’s engineering advancements, from its new island design to a novel video system offering 360-degree situational awareness. While Ford has suffered a variety of missteps over the years, few ship failures have attracted more scrutiny than the AWEs. Billed as a next-generation breakthrough, it took the Navy roughly four years after accepting the Ford to make all 11 of its weapons elevators work. Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Mike Gilday watches USS Gerald R. Ford’s (CVN-78) advanced weapons elevators (AWE) during a visit to the ship in 2019. (U.S. Navy) The Navy reported to DOT&E that Ford’s weapons department conducted 11,369 AWE runs during its May 2023 to January 2024 deployment, moving more than 1.8 million pounds of ordnance to the flight deck. Still, the report notes that these rates fall short of what these AWEs are supposed to move. 'Of note, the crew is reliant on off-ship technical support for correction of hardware and software failures,' the report states. During its deployment, the Ford maintained fighter jet sortie generation rates 'that were sufficient to meet combatant commander operational taskings.' But during carrier qualifications and other evolutions, sortie generation rates have fallen short of the program requirements, a baseline that is not listed in the report. The DOT&E blames these shortfalls on continuing issues with the 'reliability and maintainability' of the carrier’s electromagnetic aircraft launch system (EMALS) and advanced arresting gear (AAG). Ford is the first carrier to feature a catapult system not powered by steam, and issues have plagued EMALS for years. The DOT&E report warns that problems with EMALS and AAG 'continue to adversely affect sortie generation and flight operations.' The report states that the EMALS catapult and AAG arresting gear system completed 8,725 launches and arrested landings during Ford’s deployment. DOT&E did note that it hasn’t received enough data from the Navy to update the reliability statistics laid out in last year’s report. A sailor performs a prelaunch inspection on an Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) on the flight deck of the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) in September. (U.S. Navy) It also warns of 'AAG reliability degraders,' and how challenges continue to exist when it comes to obtaining AAG replacement parts. The service continues to have to rely on 'off-ship technical support' to address AAG problems as well. The Navy is also considering whether it should retrofit a fourth AAG engine on the carrier class. It was originally incorporated into Ford’s design, but not installed 'as a cost savings measure,' the report states. 'The fourth engine would improve the reliability and availability of AAG, improve the pilot boarding rate, and restore a redundant capability to rig the barricade in the event of AAG engine failure, which the current configuration does not support,' the report states. When it comes to EMALS in particular, DOT&E noted that 'reliability has not appreciably changed from prior years and reliance on off-ship technical support remains a challenge. NAVAIR is continuing development on improvements.' Fiscal Year 2024 saw the Navy make improvements to how it collects EMALS reliability data, and a similar effort for the AAG is underway. But work remains to be done. 'The Navy has not yet shown progress for data collection on the other shipboard systems, but has implemented procedural changes designed to improve data collection within shipboard work centers in support of the FY25 scheduled test events,' the report states. Meanwhile, the sea service continues to update its test plan for areas like sortie generation rate, self-defense, and cyber survivability. The aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78), sails in formation with the Japan Maritime Self Defense Force (JMSDF) Kashima class training ship, JS Kashima (TV-3508), middle, and Hatakaze class guided missile destroyer JS Shimakaze (TV-3521) in the Atlantic Ocean in September. (U.S. Navy) Ford’s berthing for its crew and carrier air wing are also lacking, the DOT&E warns. TWZ has already reported on sailor quality-of-life issues like clogging toilets, and the new report indicates that sailors could be sardined together in ever-tighter quarters. The prospect of Ford being overcrowded runs counter to the carrier class’s original vision, which entailed design changes that would reduce manning to 15 percent below a Nimitz class carrier’s force of 3,000 sailors. An embarked carrier air wing brings a Nimitz class carrier to about 5,000 in all. New ships are supposed to feature growth allowances that would allow for an extra 10 percent of the ship’s company, allowing for extra racks for crew turnover, visitors, and personnel temporarily assigned to the vessel. 'However, sufficient berthing is not installed for the Ford class to conduct combat operations with all hands assigned a bed, due to a lack of berthing capacity for embarked units,' the DOT&E found. 'If the ship and its embarked units were each at 100 percent manning, the ship would have a shortfall of 159 beds. These berthing shortfalls will affect quality of life onboard and could reduce the Navy’s operational flexibility in employing the ship across its full spectrum of missions and logistical support roles for the CSG.' Such rack shortfalls could increase as the carrier’s air wing diversifies to host the CMV-22B Osprey, the MQ-25 Stingray aerial refueling drone, and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, none of which are currently part Ford's carrier air wing (CVW). The Stingray is not yet in service, and TWZ reported last month on other changes Navy brass has planned for CVWs. The Navy's MQ-25 Stingray aerial refueling drone. (U.S. Navy) Original test plan timelines for gauging other aspects of Ford were delayed due to 'the Navy’s operational requirements,' the report notes. The Navy and Pentagon faced a difficult choice with Ford. They could have waited for all the testing to be completed, or they could have sent it east from Norfolk as a contributing member of a carrier fleet that is already stretched thin, Martin noted. 'As of its deployment, it was capable of doing most of the things aircraft carriers need to do in the environment as it exists,' he said. 'Waiting for all those to be tested might have resulted in years of delay in getting the ship out to where it could take at least some of the pressure off the operational force.' 'Were all its systems tested to the point of readiness? No,' Martin said. 'Was the ship capable of doing the job of an aircraft carrier? Yes.' The next carrier in the Ford class, the future USS John F. Kennedy, is scheduled for delivery later this fiscal year and will be capable of supporting F-35 operations. The future USS Enterprise (CVN-80) is running 18 months behind its original delivery date and is scheduled to be delivered to the Navy in Fiscal 2029, according to the DOT&E. 'This delay is due to complications with material availability and industry/supply chain performance,' the report notes. The Navy will take possession of the future USS Doris Miller (CVN-81) in Fiscal 2032, according to the report. The following two Navy carriers, CVN-82 and CVN-83, will be named after presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, respectively. Ford’s first full cruise was an operational win for the Navy’s priciest and arguably one of its historically most troubled acquisitions programs. But the DOT&E report indicates that, at least up to the cutoff date for data available in the report, much work remained to be done on the Ford to ensure that it is the high-tech, capable power projector that it has been billed as since it's inception. Clearly, there has been some progress, but some of the ship's issues require major changes or physical additions, and those don't come quickly when it comes to massive warships.

Russia’s Modernized Nuclear Battlecruiser Finally Powers Up Its R...	The hugely delayed effort to return the Russian Navy’s nuclear-powered battlecruiser Admiral Nakhimov to service is finally yielding some tangible results, according to Russian reports. Russian state media states that the 28,000-ton battlecruiser’s two nuclear reactors are now online, with claims that the warship should go back to sea for trials starting this summer. It remains to be seen whether that timeline proves anywhere remotely accurate, with the warship’s return to service having been delayed multiple times in the past. 'Last Sunday, the second nuclear reactor was physically launched on the Admiral Nakhimov cruiser,' an unnamed source in Russia’s defense-industrial complex told the state-run TASS news agency. The same outlet reports that the warship’s first reactor went online at the end of December 2024. A July 20, 2024, satellite image from the berth at Sevmash shipyard shows the Admiral Nakhimov in the water, but with much work still to be done before it can start sea trials. Google Earth 'The consecutive physical launch of the cruiser’s two reactors demonstrates the readiness of the entire nuclear powerplant of the ship for operation in all modes,' TASS reported today, noting that the Admiral Nakhimov is currently in the Sevmash shipyard in the port city of Severodvinsk on the White Sea. First launched in 1986, the Admiral Nakhimov is part of the class of warships known in Russia as the Project 11442, which is codenamed Kirov class by NATO. In its modernized form, the battlecruiser has the revised designation Project 11442M. Admiral Nakhimov, which was originally named Kalinin, photographed in around 1991, just three years after being commissioned into service. DoD For years, the Admiral Nakhimov was in dry dock undergoing a deep refit, with the original promise being that the warship would eventually emerge as basically new, with a whole range of new weapons and sensors. While those ambitions have been scaled back, adding another Kirov class vessel to the Russian Navy would be a powerful statement, both in terms of capabilities and, more significantly, prestige. Currently, the Russian Navy operates a single Kirov class battlecruiser, the Pyotr Veliky (Peter the Great), which serves with the Northern Fleet having undergone only minor modernization. As a result, it still relies primarily on its Soviet-era weapons and sensors. At one time, it was planned that the Pyotr Veliky would undergo the same in-depth rework as the Admiral Nakhimov, once the work on the latter had been completed. The status of those plans is now very uncertain, with reports that the Russian Navy may retire the battlecruiser altogether and concentrate on the Admiral Ushakov. #NavalNews SEVMASH shipyard continues upgrading the Project 11442/Kirov class heavy nuclear-powered missile cruiser Admiral Nakhimov (ex. Kalinin) to Project 11442M mod. I wonder when (and if) this decades long upgrade saga will end.Video released in November 2022 by SEVMASH. pic.twitter.com/T2zqFxDaNn&mdash; Saturnax (@Saturnax1) December 12, 2022 Two earlier hulls, the Admiral Ushakov and the Admiral Lazarev have been out of service for many years and have since been consigned to scrap. While there have been many interruptions to the effort to get the Admiral Nakhimov back to operational status — not least the turmoil as a result of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine — it should be recalled that this was never going to be a straightforward undertaking. The Admiral Nakhimov seen in the the Sevmash shipyard in 2017, totally stripped and with a green and red base coat applied. YouTube screencap After all, the Admiral Nakhimov had sat idle for over a decade in the frigid White Sea, with work only really starting to progress in 2014. Since then, the planned delivery date has also been pushed back repeatedly. Originally the project was going to be completed around 2018. Then it was pushed back to 2019, and then 2020. As of 2017, TASS was reporting that work on the battlecruiser should be completed by 2021. Then, in 2021, it was reported that the warship wouldn’t return to service before 2023, while in 2022 the Sevmash shipyard stated that service re-entry had now been pushed back to 2024. It’s certainly not the case that the shipyard has been idle, however. Previous images from Severodvinsk have shown huge portions of the warship entirely gutted, with the expectation that they will accommodate new weapons and sensors. The ambition of thoroughly remodeling the battlecruiser has certainly been evident, although it remains to be seen exactly how thorough this has been, once the warship finally goes back to sea. The Admiral Nakhimov surrounded by scaffolding, in the the Sevmash shipyard in 2017. YouTube screencap Originally, the refit was set to provide the Admiral Nakhimov with no fewer than 174 vertical launch tubes — which would provide it with more than any other surface combatant or submarine in the world. Plans called for 80 of these tubes to accommodate various modern Russian cruise missiles, including the subsonic Kalibr, the supersonic Oniks, and supposedly the hypersonic Zircon. The former location of the Granit (SS-N-19 Shipwreck) missile farm in the hull of the Admiral Nakhimov during its refit. Now, vertical launch cells should fill the space where 20 angled Granit launch tubes were previously found. YouTube screencap As far as Russia has claimed, Zircon has to date only been deployed on Russian Navy Admiral Gorshkov class frigates, although there is compelling evidence that the missile has also been combat tested in Ukraine. Previously, there were public announcements that the Kirov class would be the first operational launch platform for the hypersonic weapon, although any such plans would have been superseded by the delays with the modernization of the Admiral Nakhimov. Meanwhile, for air defense, other tubes would reportedly be filled with surface-to-air missiles associated with the S-300FM Fort system, derived from the land-based S-300 system. While these were part of the previous armament, they would have been bolstered by eight Pantsir-M combined gun/missile systems for short-range air defense. Other reports in the past have suggested that missiles from the land-based S-400 air defense system may be incorporated, as a further evolution of the S-300FM, which would provide a more robust anti-ballistic missile capability. Alongside these new weapons, the Admiral Nakhimov was at one time set to have almost every item of combat-related equipment replaced with more modern successors as part of a wide-ranging systems overhaul. A video gives some idea as to how extensive the work on the Admiral Nakhimov has been (starts at 4:45): If the Admiral Nakhimov does emerge with the promised full set of new weapons and sensors — and that’s a big question — it will provide the Russian Navy with its most powerful surface combatant. The modernized warship — together with the less-capable Pyotr Veliky — will then be available as the centerpieces of Russian flotillas. Their value will be greater since the prospect of the aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov returning to service — at least, any time soon — remains unclear. With the Russian Defense Ministry meanwhile prioritizing the war in Ukraine, as well as modernization of the strategic arsenal, the Russian Navy may well consider itself lucky to be able to put a major surface combatant into service, albeit a reworked one. This is especially relevant since plans to develop a new class of ‘super-destroyer’ have long since been shelved, with current construction programs focusing on more modest frigates and corvettes, as well as new-generation submarines. A model of the Project 23560 Lider class nuclear-powered destroyer, work on which appears to have been suspended indefinitely. Artem Tkachenko via Wikimedia It’s worth noting that the Kirov class represents the last nuclear-powered surface combatant in service anywhere in the world, with the U.S. Navy having retired the last of its nuclear-powered cruisers in the 1990s, primarily on cost grounds. Once again, whatever the final configuration of the Admiral Nakhimov once it returns to service, this impressive warship will be a very significant symbol of Russian naval power and one that could potentially serve for many more years to come.

RC-135 Rivet Joint Surveillance Jet Just Flew Unprecedented Missi...	A U.S. Air Force RC-135V Rivet Joint conducted a highly unusual flight in the Gulf of California between Mexico's Baja Peninsula and the rest of that country yesterday, according to online flight tracking data. The strategic intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) plane looks to have done the same today. The Rivet Joint is one of America's most capable intelligence-gathering assets and the appearance of one off the Mexican coast is a significant development. This comes amid a major increase in U.S. military support to operations along the border with Mexico under President Donald Trump and talk of unprecedented direct action by American forces against drug cartels, which you can read more about in this separate TWZ feature. Flight tracking software shows RC-135V serial number 64-14845 flew southwest from Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska to the skies over southern California on February 3. Offutt is home to the 55th Wing, which oversees the bulk of the Air Force's Rivet Joint fleet along with an array of other ISR and highly specialized command and control aircraft. The jet then hooked south along the Pacific coast of the Baja Peninsula before flying up into the Gulf of California. The aircraft subsequently returned to Offutt following the same route, but in reverse. USAF RC-135V Rivet Joint operating in the Gulf of California.

There are no indications that 64-14845 ever entered Mexican national airspace in the course of any of these flights. When queried about 64-14845's activity off the coast of Mexico, the U.S. Air Force redirected TWZ to U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM). We have also reached out to the Mexican Embassy in Washington, D.C. A stock picture of an RC-135V/W Rivet Joint. USAF It is worth noting up front that the use of RC-135V/W Rivet Joints to support operations in the Western Hemisphere, especially counter-drug missions, is not necessarily well known, but is also not new, something TWZ has highlighted in the past. Rivet Joints flying sorties tasked to NORTHCOM, specifically, is something that occurs on a somewhat regular basis, as well.

From there, 64-14845 could listen into the northwestern corner of Mexico, an area that largely falls under the influence of the infamous Sinaloa Cartel. Whose boss?

The aircraft can also geolocate and categorize the emitters sending out those signals, from radios to radars. On a typical mission, an RC-135V/W's crew consists of more than two dozen individuals, which includes linguists, electronic warfare officers, and other intelligence specialists who can immediately begin analyzing the information the SIGINT suites collect. The Rivet Joint also has an extensive communications array that allows data to be passed in near real-time to nearby units in the field and/or to nodes globally for further exploitation and dissemination. An Air Force briefing slide offering a breakdown of a typical Rivet Joint crew. The note at the bottom refers to the plane’s ability to perform 'processing, exploitation, and dissemination,' or PED, of intelligence data on board and then send that information along in near-real time. USAF Intercepting and geolocating communications chatter, together with other intelligence, can help establish so-called 'patterns of life' for a select individual or group of individuals. That information, in turn, can be used to help further refine intelligence gathering strategies or even plan and execute targeted ground raids or strikes. Similarly, data provided by Rivet Joints can also help in the creation of what are known as electronic orders of battle detailing the disposition of enemy or potentially hostile forces, especially air defense units and command and control nodes, in a given area. However, this is not applicable to the flights off the coast of Mexico. Rivet Joint flights in the Gulf of California could provide a valuable additional stream of intelligence on cartels operations and other illicit activities, as well as just better situational awareness about what is happening in a critical cartel activity area. That would be in line with official statements from the Pentagon about its expanded presence around the southern border since President Trump took office in January. 'We anticipate that overall, on the southwest border, [active-duty personnel] will provide real-time situational awareness of persons, vehicles, vessels and aircraft; and they'll work with [U.S. Customs and Border Protection] on operator-level maintenance, movement and staging of [CBP] assets,' a senior U.S. military official said last month. 'We also anticipate that there could be some additional airborne intelligence, surveillance, and support assets that would move down to the border to increase situational awareness.' USNI News reported yesterday that U.S. Navy P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol planes are now conducting flights along the border with Mexico as another example of increased U.S. military ISR support. P-8As also have extensive SIGINT capabilities, as well as turrets with electro-optical and infrared video cameras. US Navy personnel assigned to Patrol Squadron 40 (VP-40) onboard a P-8A during a flight along the southern border on January 31, 2025. USN Petty Officer 2nd Class Andy Anderson Intelligence that RC-135V/Ws, as well as other ISR aircraft, collect could be passed along to other U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies, including to support interdiction operations on land and at sea. The U.S. military has an established history already of providing near real-time information from aerial surveillance platforms about suspected drug smuggling and other illicit activities to law enforcement agencies along the border, as TWZ has explored in detail in the past. Certain intelligence might also be passed to authorities in Mexico to support their counter-drug and other operations. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum pledged to deploy 10,000 troops on her country's side of the border to help combat drug trafficking yesterday as part of an ostensible deal to try to stave off a trade war with the United States. Sheinbaum's predecessor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, had similarly agreed to send 10,000 troops to the border back in 2021 as part of an earlier agreement struck with former President Biden's administration. The appearance of a Rivet Joint in the Gulf of California also comes amid open discussion about the possibility of the U.S. military taking direct action against drug cartels in Mexico, including targeted strikes. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said in an interview on Fox last Friday that 'all options will be on the table,' but added that any such decision to act would rest with President Trump. Pete Hegseth on possible military strikes in Mexico: 'All options will be on the table.' pic.twitter.com/O2nxPYoksG&mdash; Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) January 31, 2025 The capabilities that the Air Force's RC-135V/Ws offer mean its presence could be a precursor to such an operational intent, dramatically increasing the quality and volume of available intelligence collection. Rivet Joints are used regularly in this general role in the lead-up to larger operations. As just one example, Rivet Joints flew regularly off the coast of Syria in the lead-up to U.S.-led missile strikes on multiple targets in that country in April 2018 during President Turmp's first term in office. At the same time, they RC-135V/Ws are also used to collect regular intelligence from a standoff distance all over the world. So, it is important to stress that there are no indications at the time of writing that any such direct military activity is imminent or even planned. In addition, even if the flights were conducted with the explicit approval of the Mexican government, pursuing that course of action would have far-reaching ramifications. TWZ has published a feature just today exploring these issues, which you can find here. Still, openly conducting Rivet Joint sorties in the Gulf California, together with the rest of the expanding U.S. military presence around the southern border, does already send broader signals to Mexico's cartels across the region.

Pentagon Still Unsure About Lethality Of Dark Eagle Hypersonic Mi...	The U.S. Department of Defense has disclosed that it’s still unclear about the lethal effects of the hypersonic missile that’s at the center of the Army’s Dark Eagle Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW) and which will arm the Navy’s Zumwalt class stealth destroyers and future Block V Virginia class submarines. The surprising knowledge gap comes after the Army achieved the long-delayed first test-firing of a Dark Eagle missile from its trailer-based launcher, something you can read more about here. The latest updates on the progress of the in-development Dark Eagle are provided by the Office of the Director, Operational Test & Evaluation, in its latest Annual Report. An M983A4 tractor truck towing a Dark Eagle launcher trailer. U.S. Army The report outlines the test program for the Dark Eagle in FY24, which began in the first quarter with an Army/Navy risk-reduction campaign, followed in the third quarter by integrated launch sequence testing, intended to iron out problems encountered in earlier flight tests. In the past, the Army had specifically pointed to issues with the launcher for causing significant delays in the planned fielding of the weapon system. In 2023 alone, the Army scrubbed three planned launches. The third quarter of FY24 also saw a successful launch of the Navy’s prototype All-Up-Round (AUR) — the actual missile component for the Army’s Dark Eagle and the Navy’s Intermediate-Range Conventional Prompt Strike (IRCPS) program, but that made use of a different ground-based launch apparatus. In the final quarter of FY24, the Army planned to conduct a missile test from a prototype transporter-erector-launcher (TEL), but this was shelved. A photo from the successful test launch of the common AUR in the third quarter of FY24. DOD Finally, in December 2024, there was a successful test launch from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, as TWZ reported at the time, although this is outside the scope of the latest report. This was the second successful end-to-end flight test of the AUR in the course of 2024, but was the first live-fire event involving the missile as well as a battery operations center (BOC) and TEL. Here is one of my iPhone videos of the LRHW test launch from Cape Canaveral this morning. pic.twitter.com/ZCKF3lTEuU&mdash; JohnCn (@JConcilus) December 12, 2024 As we’ve discussed in the past, the Dark Eagle is a prototype surface-to-surface long-range strategic fires system, which consists of one TEL and two Navy-designed AURs that are loaded in Army AUR canisters (known as AUR+C). In its initial form, each Army battery will have four TELs, each with two AUR+C, plus a BOC. A slide from an earlier Navy briefing providing a visual overview of the Intermediate-Range Conventional Prompt Strike (IRCPS) program and related systems, including elements of the Army’s Dark Eagle/LRHW effort. U.S. Navy Looking at the AUR specifically, this comprises two main components: a two-stage rocket booster with an unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicle, known as the Common Hypersonic Glide Body, on top. Under the CPS program, the same AUR will be launched from canisters on the Zumwalt class and the Block V Virginia class. A graphic giving a general breakdown of the common missile for the Dark Eagle/LRHW and IRCPS systems, as well as the division of labor between the Army and the Navy. GAO The two-stage rocket brings the conical ‘glide vehicle’ to an optimal speed and altitude before releasing it, after which it glides down to its target at hypersonic speeds, defined as anything above Mach 5, and along a relatively shallow, atmospheric flight path, maneuvering erratically along the way. The Army has previously said the weapon’s peak speed is at least Mach 17 and its maximum range is in excess of 1,725 miles. A close-up look at the common missile fired during the first successful test involving the Dark Eagle launcher. DOD Returning to the test program, what’s especially notable is that it has so far yielded insufficient data 'to evaluate the operational effectiveness, lethality, suitability, and survivability of the LRHW system,' the report states. Essentially, although it has been test-fired, the Pentagon is not able to 'make an adequate determination of AUR lethality,' noting that 'uncertainty in weaponeering tools could result in excessive employment requirements or failure to meet warfighter objectives.' In this context, excessive employment refers to multiple examples of the missile being required to destroy certain targets. This would be a significant drawback, especially given the limited number of missiles in each Dark Eagle battery not to mention the huge costs of hypersonic weapons. A U.S. Army infographic showing the basic components of the LRHW, as well as a notional firing battery. U.S. Army In the meantime, the Navy has tested the warhead for the AUR, but independent of the missile. An arena test for the warhead was carried out in the first quarter of FY24, followed by a sled test in the second quarter of FY24. The Pentagon says that this sled test 'included some threat-representative targets,' but also notes that results are still being processed. Earlier sled and flight tests 'did not include operationally representative targets and consequently provided no direct validation of the weapon’s lethal effects,' the Pentagon adds. While the Director, Operational Test & Evaluation (DOT&E) was due to provide an independent assessment of the operational effectiveness and lethality of the missile based on the FY24 tests, it’s notable that the Navy is also looking at other methods to obtain effectiveness and lethality data, by using representative targets in future flight tests. One of the first Dark Eagle launchers delivered to the U.S. Army, loaded with an inert missile canister. U.S. Army As well as lingering questions about the lethality of the missile, there is also still a lack of data about the weapon’s own survivability, the Pentagon says. 'The Army has not yet evaluated the effects of a full-spectrum (kinetic, non-kinetic, electromagnetic, cyber) threat-contested environment on the performance of the AUR, TEL, or BOC,' the report states. As of the end of FY24, there had been no end-to-end cyber survivability testing, something that’s required to better understand potential vulnerability and to better assess its likelihood of defeating a defended target. For a missile that’s meant to defeat high-value and time-sensitive targets, this would seem to be a glaring omission. In the meantime, the report adds, the Army is relying on the Navy’s data gathered via modeling and simulation, component testing, and hardware-in-the-loop evaluations to better evaluate the AUR’s full-spectrum survivability. For the future, the DOT&E report outlines the requirements for the evaluation of operational effectiveness, lethality, suitability, and survivability, as follows: 'The test strategy should include the following considerations: a concept of employment consistent with the expected operational and threat environment; an operational demonstration that includes strategic-level mission planning; test and evaluation in a full-spectrum contested environment, including representative targets; and validated modeling and simulation, combined with ground and subscale test data…' Another view of a Dark Eagle launcher. U.S. Army Ultimately, the Army 'needs to incorporate representative targets and environments into flight tests and other live lethality and survivability tests,' this portion of the report concludes. While it’s to be expected that the lethal effects of a new missile system won’t be known until the requisite end-to-end testing has been completed in an operationally realistic environment, somewhat more surprising is the relatively compressed timescale the program is otherwise working to. The Army plans to complete the rapid fielding of the Dark Eagle under a so-called Middle Tier of Acquisition (MTA) effort by FY27. This calls for the fielding of two additional batteries. These will follow the initial Dark Eagle unit — Battery B, 5th Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery (Long Range Fires Battalion), part of the 1st Multi-Domain Task Force (MDTF) — that has already been activated at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington State. Last month, we got our first look at the four new launch tubes for hypersonic missiles installed on the USS Zumwalt. The other two ships in the Zumwalt class are also set to get the same array of tubes. At the same time, the ships are losing at least one of their 155mm Advanced Gun Systems (AGS), the advanced ammunition that the Navy previously determined would be too expensive to buy. A slide from a presentation at the 2025 Surface Navy Association symposium, which also details the timeline for installing the new launch tubes onto the USS Zumwalt. U.S. Navy Should the next phase of tests reveal that the lethal effects of the hypersonic missile, or its survivability fall short of what is required, that leaves precious little time to make modifications — provided that is even possible. At the same time, the importance of the Dark Eagle and Intermediate-Range Conventional Prompt Strike within the Pentagon’s strategic fires portfolio is only increasing. Following the apparent cancellation of the U.S. Air Force’s AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW) program in 2023, it appeared that Dark Eagle would become the U.S. military’s first operational novel hypersonic weapon. At this stage, there’s still some uncertainty surrounding ARRW status and there could still be plans for a follow-on effort.

This picture was taken ahead of the last publicly known planned live-fire test, which occcured the following month. USAF Regardless, the U.S. military is now doubling down on developing and fielding hypersonic boost-glide vehicle weapons, as well as air-breathing hypersonic cruise missiles. With a growing focus on the potential future high-end conflict in the Pacific against China, these kinds of weapons are seen as critical to successfully prosecute a range of targets both on land and at sea. Also, America's most capable adversaries have already fielded similar systems, at least to a degree, putting the U.S. in the position of playing catchup. Meanwhile, increasing tensions between Russia and NATO have resulted in plans for 'episodic deployments' of ground-based hypersonic and other long-range missile systems to Europe. With their combination of speed, maneuverability, and altitude, hypersonic missiles should offer a highly survivable means of rapidly defeating time-critical, heavily defended targets. That remains the goal of Dark Eagle and the Navy’s Intermediate-Range Conventional Prompt Strike program. Based on the currently available test data, however, the Pentagon will have to wait a little longer to confirm whether the novel missile used in these systems fully meets these aspirations.

How Trump Could Use Military Force Against Cartels In Mexico	President Donald Trump, who has frequently suggested he might use U.S. military force against the cartels in Mexico, currently has options to do so. However, even with the new executive order he signed designating cartels as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTO), Trump would still face several legal and policy hurdles, as well as geopolitical considerations, before he could broaden the scope of any actions across the border, according to former military, intelligence and government officials we spoke with. Such a move would be unprecedented - the U.S. military has never directly attacked cartels in Mexico, some of those former officials told us. The most recent indication of Trump administration's intentions came last week when Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was asked if he would use the military to combat cartels. 'All options will be on the table if we're dealing with what are designated to be foreign terrorist organizations who are specifically targeting Americans on our border,' he told Fox News. Hegseth did not provide any specifics because he didn’t want to get ahead of Trump on the issue. The president has yet to publicly divulge his plans. Pete Hegseth on possible military strikes in Mexico: 'All options will be on the table.' pic.twitter.com/GJ548lc9fl&mdash; AlexandruC4 (@AlexandruC4) January 31, 2025 However, a number of actions have to take place before we see anything like the scene depicted in the 1994 movie Clear and Present Danger, in which a U.S. Navy F/A-18 Hornet carries out a missile strike on a Colombian cartel leader. 'Presidents - and especially this President - assert very broad power to use force unilaterally, at least up to a certain level, without congressional authorization' under Article II of the U.S. Constitution, Matthew C. Waxman, Liviu Librescu Professor of Law at Columbia University, told us. 'The claim is generally that as commander in chief and chief executive, the president has power to military force to defend the United States.' A direct attack by cartels north of the border would give Trump the widest latitude for responding with military force inside Mexico, Javed Ali, who worked in the National Security Council’s (NSC) counterterrorism unit during the first Trump administration, told us on Monday. There is already reported chatter about that, with claims that cartels are discussing using weaponized drones against U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CPB) and law enforcement personnel along the border. In addition to spurring Trump to invoke Article II, such an attack would allow him to respond under United Nations Article 51’s self-defense provisions, noted Ali, now an associate professor of practice at the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan teaching courses on counterterrorism and domestic terrorism, cybersecurity, and national security law and policy. Trump could also invoke the War Powers Act, which would give him 60 days to carry out military operations before seeking Congressional approval, Ali explained. Meanwhile, the new executive order on cartels, which has yet to be enacted, would not greatly open the aperture on U.S. military actions in Mexico, Waxman stated. That executive order is one of several Trump signed to deal with the problems of drugs, unchecked immigration, and human trafficking. After signing an executive order designating Mexican cartels as Foreign Terrorist Organizations, Trump says he could send U.S. Special Forces into Mexico to liquidate the cartels.Claudia Sheinbaum won’t be happy hearing that… pic.twitter.com/ruTK1cddHm&mdash; Visegrád 24 (@visegrad24) January 21, 2025 'Designating cartels as FTOs has some legal effects and some political ones,' said Waxman, who served in senior positions at the State Department, Department of Defense, and National Security Council during the George W. Bush administration. As a National Security Council aide, he was involved in the White House response to the attacks on September 11, 2001. 'Legally, [the executive order] triggers a range of criminal law enforcement and immigration authorities, as well as financial measures, that can be used to squeeze them and cut off support for them. Politically, it can help elevate their threat by treating them like other grave national security threats, and thereby lay some groundwork for future actions. However, FTO designations do not directly trigger authorities to use military force.' The designation, for instance, would not automatically give Trump the ability to carry out special operations forces raids against cartels akin to the U.S. Navy SEAL Team 6 Operation Neptune Spear mission that killed Osama Bin Laden in Pakistan on May 1, 2011. However, there is an existing law that could make such an action against cartels possible. President Barack Obama invoked Title 50, the U.S. law permitting a president to carry out clandestine operations in foreign countries, to justify that operation. Osama Bin Laden's compound in Pakistan raided by U.S. Navy SEALS. AFP PHOTO/ AAMIR QURESHI (Photo credit should read AAMIR QURESHI/AFP via Getty Images) AAMIR QURESHI 'Every president has a powerful tool under Title 50 in which military operations could be approved and conducted against a priority U.S. target in a foreign country, but without the consultation or coordination of the foreign government in which the target is located,' explained Ali. 'It's possible that the president could authorize and notify to the congressional intelligence committees a covert action program against the cartels,' under Title 50, Waxman noted. 'I don't know if Trump or a previous president has done so, or what the parameters are of such a covert action program. The intelligence oversight statutes allow the president quite broad authority to initiate covert action programs, subject to certain special procedures and reporting requirements.' There are other precedents for using force against terror groups on foreign soil. U.S. drone strikes like those that killed ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi in 2019, the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps leader Qassem Soleimani in 2020, and the airstrike carried out last week against ISIS leaders in Somalia were all conducted against terror groups. You can see the latest attack in the following video. pic.twitter.com/PK1V8YklhY&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2025 However, those actions were justified under the Authorization for the Use of Military Forces (AUMF) against Islamic terror organizations enacted in the wake of Al-Qaeda’s 2001 attack on New York and Washington D.C. The 2001 AUMF was enacted to allow then-President George W. Bush to go after that operation's planners and those who aided and harbored them. Another AUMF was authorized in 2002 to give Bush the authority to invade Iraq and subsequent administrations used it to justify actions against Islamic terror groups around the world. At present, cartels are not considered to be directly connected in a significant scale to these Islamic terror groups. Should Trump want to launch an airstrike, a special operations forces raid or even a wider military strategy against cartels in Mexico, he would likely need a new AUMF specifically tailored for those organizations, Ali posited. Waxman, however, had a different take, suggesting that Trump would not need a new AUMF to go after cartels, but might want one 'to make his legal arguments stronger.' Either way, a cartel-designated AUMF is something that has been considered before. In a piece he co-authored for Lawfare, Waxman noted that in 2023, some Republican House members introduced an AUMF against fentanyl-trafficking cartels. Current U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz was one of the co-sponsors when he was in Congress. The measure never passed. West Coast-based Naval Special Warfare (NSW) operators prepare to enter a building while conducting nighttime direct action raid training at Fort Irwin. (DoD) Petty Officer 2nd Class Charles Propert While a Title 50 operation in Mexico would not require an AUMF, such a mission would likely be a one-off, Ali suggested. 'Using the 2011 [Bin Laden] raid as an example, given the risky cross-border nature of that kind of operation, the U.S. would probably only do that once under Title 50 versus a new AUMF from Congress that would authorize a longer pattern of military operations similar to the campaign against AQ and the Taliban in Afghanistan or against ISIS in Iraq and Syria in the mid-2010s,' stated Ali. There is another option at Trump’s disposal. CIA Special Operations Group (SOG) teams could conceivably target cartel personnel. 'This would require a presidential finding and compliance with covert action oversight laws, and because assassinations are barred by an executive order, the CIA would need to argue that this is not a political killing but is something else,' Waxman explained.

(Photo by Shaul Schwarz/Edit by Getty Images) Shaul Schwarz Regardless of whether he followed required authorizations or not, Trump’s first option would likely be airstrikes — with drones and/or standoff weapons being the most likely option — for several reasons. As we have previously reported, Mexico’s increasingly well-armed drug cartels pose a serious threat to external forces. Some cartel units are extremely well-equipped and have adopted some of the latest features of warfare. They have been using drones to attack enemies for years now, for instance. This is terrifying. Video released by the Mexican cartel and paramilitary group CJNG show the extent of militarization of their special forces. Scores of armed & kitted out fighters in standardized uniforms line a large convoy of up-armored troop transport vehicles and technicals pic.twitter.com/Kffz6UYwIX&mdash; Hugo Kaaman (@HKaaman) July 18, 2020 These organizations also often move around in increasingly well protected so called 'narco tanks.' Cartels can also have defacto control over large areas with lots of support at the ready. Inner circles around key drug lords are among the most heavily defended and fortified positions in these areas, which makes them challenging targets. But the same 'find and fix' tactics that have been used to take out terrorists in the Middle East, especially with the help of drones, could potentially be brought to bear to help solve that problem. Unless Mexico agrees to their employment, they would not be operating in totally permissible airspace. While Mexico's air defenses are extremely rudimentary, this could still be an issue. Any sort of ground raid without prior authority from Mexico raises the concern that any U.S. troops inadvertently left behind or otherwise captured could be without legal protection. That’s why U.S. military deployments frequently take place with Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs) giving military personnel and civilian contractors protection from being subject to unfair criminal or civil justice systems. 'This is important not only to protect the rights of U.S. service members and to vindicate the United States’ interest in exercising disciplinary jurisdiction over U.S. uniformed personnel, but also because U.S. willingness to deploy forces overseas – and public support for such deployments – could suffer significant setbacks if U.S. personnel were at risk of being tried in an inherently unfair system, or at any rate, in one that departs fundamentally from U.S. concepts of basic procedural fairness,' according to the U.S. State Department. While far less risky to U.S. troops, the downside of relying solely on airpower is the loss of valuable intelligence U.S. forces could gather on the ground to rapidly exploit, as they did in Afghanistan and Iraq. MQ-9 Reapers were America's weapon of choice when it comes to finding and targeting nefarious actors during the Global War on Terror. Many of those same lessons learned could apply to a fight against the Cartels, but there are hurdles to such a plan, as well. (USAF) Either way, whether an airstrike or a raid, the U.S. directly attacking the cartel in its own bastion would be a huge escalation and could spark and wider, sustained crescendo of hostilities, especially along the U.S.-Mexico border. Even cartel reprisal actions inside the U.S. are possible. Beyond direct military action, designating FTOs as terror organizations would also not necessarily increase the ability to collect intelligence against them, a former senior U.S. intelligence official told The War Zone. 'As long as they're not a U.S. person, you can collect on all you want,' said the former official, speaking on condition of anonymity. 'Drug traffickers would certainly fall into that category.' In one example of that underway already, a U.S. Air Force RC-135V/W Rivet Joint surveillance jet on Monday was spotted by an online flight-tracking site executing an unprecedented set of mission through the narrow Gulf of California. This is directly adjacent to notorious cartel hotspots. The use of U.S. military surveillance aircraft in the counter-narcotics role is far from new, but placing one of America’s most capable strategic aerial collection platforms right in the Mexican cartels’ backyard certainly is.

That does not seem to be forthcoming from the Mexican government at this point. This would be another complicating factor for any assault, even if a one-off operation, as it could end up with the Mexican military confronting U.S. soldiers if things go deeply awry. Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum recently said that Trump’s executive order would only be applicable if there’s close coordination between the two governments, The Associated Press reported. Mexico would defend its sovereignty and independence while seeking coordination with the U.S. in the wake of the order, she stated on Monday. 'We all want to fight the drug cartels,' Sheinbaum said at her daily press briefing. The U.S. 'in their territory, us in our territory.' A member of the National Guard in Bavispe, Sonora State, Mexico, on January 12, 2020, (Photo by Alfredo ESTRELLA / AFP) (Photo by ALFREDO ESTRELLA/AFP via Getty Images) ALFREDO ESTRELLA A retired special forces officer we spoke with noted that there have been times in the past when the U.S. was kicked out of a country by its leadership. He pointed to Bolivia as one example. 'If you don't have the host nation backing, it will get bad,' he said. 'We had a situation with [then president] Evo Morales in Bolivia. He was upset and asked the DEA to leave. We had traditionally sent two SF teams there since 1986. We had a good relationship with them.' While there is a lot of conjecture about what could take place, the U.S. military has a long history of efforts to counter cartels in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America. These have been advise and assist missions to help host nations conducted by the U.S. Army Special Forces, better known as Green Berets. As part of their Foreign Internal Defense (FID) mission, Green Berets help host nations fight cartels without taking direct action themselves. These missions have traditionally fallen to the 7th Special Forces Group, the experts we spoke with explained. That’s because that group, headquartered at Eglin Air Force Base in the Florida panhandle, has Latin America as its area of responsibility and many members are fluent in Spanish and knowledgeable about the region and its customs. Special Forces Operational Detachment Alpha, 7th Special Forces (Airborne), executes a Demo and live fire exercise at Camp 'Bull' Simons , Fla., June 29, 2023. The exercise keeps SFODA’s current on training in order to execute missions across the globe. (DoD) 'They would be the right guys,' said the retired SOF officer, who spent a dozen years assigned to the U.S.-led Plan Colombia. That was the counterinsurgency/counternarcotics fight against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), a guerilla group heavily involved in the drug trade that undermined security and the rule of law in Colombia and across Latin America. 'During the Plan Colombia period that I participated in from 1999 to 2011, the 7th Special Forces trained the 3,500-man Colombian Army Counterdrug Brigade, the 600-man Junglas (Police Airmobile Antinarcotics Unit), the Colombian Army special forces units: the Lancero Battalion and the Commando Battalion,' said the expert. 'They organized the instructor cadre for the Police Mobile Carabinero Squadrons (80 x 120-man police units that operate in rural areas), and they trained the 80-man national unit, the AFEU.' The 7th Special Forces Group conducting marksmanship training with the Colombian Army on the range at Tolemaida. (U.S. Army Special Forces) The expert foresees similar efforts with Mexico's special military and law enforcement units who take the lead in the fight against cartels. They also noted that these are law enforcement missions, and these special units are employed when greater force, advanced military skills, and special equipment are needed to provide the decisive edge in confronting the heavily armed cartels. He laid out several steps that have already been taken. 'US Special Operations Forces (Army, Navy, Marines) can train Mexico’s special military and police units in operations planning and execution,' he stated. SOF liaison officers, known as LNOS, 'are assigned to the Embassy Working Group. They meet with the Mexican special units to assist in planning and provide the US Embassy with situational awareness.' 'All of these missions (border and Mexico) have been done by the U.S. military in the past,' he explained. 'They can be implemented quickly and with no foreign or domestic controversy.'

(Photo credit should read YURI CORTEZ/AFP via Getty Images) YURI CORTEZ The chances of Trump ordering some sort of unilateral action against the cartels in Mexico may have somewhat diminished as of yesterday. He reached a deal with Mexico to delay the imposition of a 25% tariff on goods imported from there over what he perceived as that government’s unwillingness to stop the flow of drugs and people across the border. Meanwhile, Sheinbaum announced a series of steps she is taking. 'We had a good conversation with President Trump with great respect for our relationship and sovereignty,' she stated on X. '&#8230;Mexico will immediately reinforce the northern border with 10,000 members of the National Guard to prevent drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States, particularly fentanyl' while 'The United States is committed to working to prevent the trafficking of high-powered weapons to Mexico.' Both nations, she added, 'will begin working today on two fronts: security and trade.' Sostuvimos una buena conversación con el presidente Trump con mucho respeto a nuestra relación y la soberanía; llegamos a una serie de acuerdos:1.México reforzará la frontera norte con 10 mil elementos de la Guardia Nacional de forma inmediata, para evitar el tráfico de drogas…&mdash; Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo (@Claudiashein) February 3, 2025 While this moment of detente may seem encouraging, and the results could help slow the flow of drugs and human trafficking across the border further, the cartels remain. Strangling their cash flow, which can often lead to turf wars amongst themselves, certainly is a critical aspect to any fight against them. But if Trump really plans on going after the cartels directly, it will take more than that, and what that could look like remains to be seen. But clearly, he does have options.

VH-92 Patriot Fully Taking Over Marine One Duties Has Slipped To ...	The U.S. Marine Corps transition to the VH-92A Patriot as its only helicopter for use in the 'Marine One' role shuttling the president, the vice president, their families, and their closest advisors around at home and abroad, is still underway and now we know it won't be done till 2030, at the earliest. That is seven years later than the last plan for the VH-92's ascendency laid out. Aging VH-3Ds currently used for the mission are set to be retired completely next year. However, the service does expect to keep flying its VH-60Ns through at least 2030 because of their particular ability to operate in hot and/or high-altitude environments. The existing plan that was disclosed in 2021, declared that the Marines would divested all of the VH-3Ds and VH-60Ns by 2023. One of HMX-1's VH-60N helicopters. US Army New information about the Marine Corps presidential helicopter fleets, all of which are assigned to Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), are contained in a new Aviation Plan the service released today. A VH-3D assigned to HMX-1. USMC The 2025 Aviation Plan does not say how many VH-3Ds or VH-60Ns are still in service currently. As of 2022, when the Corps put out its last public Aviation Plan, HMX-1 had 11 VH-3Ds and eight VH-60Ns. The U.S. Navy, in cooperation with the Marines, accepted the delivery of the 23rd and final VH-92 in August 2024. Former President Joe Biden became the first American head of state to fly on one of the Patriots that same month. Then President Joe Biden disembarks from a VH-92A in Chicago in August 2024, the first time one of the helicopters had been used in the Marine One role. BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images 'The U.S. Marine Corps declared initial operational capability for the VH-92A in December 2021 and HMX-1 began its introduction into operational missions in 2022 following White House commissioning events,' according to the 2025 Aviation Plan. 'HMX-1 currently has 10 VH-92As to support mission tasking,' it adds. 'Once fully transitioned and divested of legacy aircraft, HMX-1 will operate 16 VH-92As.' Two of the 23 VH-92As are known to be dedicated test aircraft. If HMX-1 is ultimately expected to operate just 16 of the helicopters, it is unclear what will happen to the remaining five airframes. TWZ has reached out to the Marine Corps for more information. Regardless, 'HMX-1 is currently conducting an in-stride transition from legacy VH-3D and VH-60N aircraft to the VH-92A,' per the new aviation plan. 'Both [the VH-3D and VH-60N] aircraft have been through a Service Life Extension Program and have sufficient hours to support the mission through full transition to the VH-92A. Aircraft will be retired as they reach airframe hours limits and as the VH-92A takes on more of the mission. VH-3D aircraft are anticipated to continue serving through 2026. Due to their unique capabilities in high/hot environments, the VH-60N aircraft are anticipated to continue serving through 2030 before being fully retired.' A VH-60N parked on the ground with a VH-92A flying in the background. USMC Very hot temperatures and/or high altitudes degrade the performance of helicopters, in general, potentially to a dangerous degree. Types that offer particularly good hot-and-high performance therefore provide clear advantages in those environments over ones that don't. In line with this, VH-60Ns have been regularly seen over the years supporting presidential visits to relevant locales, including Afghanistan, Somalia, and even the Swiss Alps, among many others. The retention of at least a portion of the VH-60N fleet through 2030 specifically for its hot-and-high performance does raise questions about whether the VH-92 will be able to sufficiently meet that need in the future if the new helicopters cannot adequately do so now. 'No major upgrades are currently planned for either [the VH-3D or VH-60N] aircraft,' the 2025 Aviation Plan notes. 'However, minor communications upgrades may be necessary to ensure the remaining legacy aircraft are operationally relevant until the squadron has completely transitioned to the VH-92A.' Communications systems issues were one of the hurdles the VH-92A itself had overcome on its long road to reaching operational service. Sikorsky won a rebooted competition to replace the VH-3D and VH-60N in 2014. That followed the cancellation of plans to acquire the Lockheed Martin VH-71 Kestrel, a derivative of the Anglo-Italian AW101 from AgustaWestland (since subsumed into Leonardo), due to delays and cost growth. Lockheed Martin has since acquired Sikorsky. The first VH-71 prototype seen arriving at Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland in 2005. USN Other issues beyond extremely reliable and secure communications, a critical requisite for the Marine One mission, held up the operational employment of the VH-92A. This notably included the helicopter's exhaust system scorching the White House lawn. Whether changes have been made to the exhaust system to rectify or mitigate that particular problem is unclear. 'The VCD [verification of correction of deficiencies] operational test conducted in FY24 found that 30 open deficiencies had been adequately corrected, 1 has been mitigated through changes to the standard operating procedures, and 1 is no longer applicable due to a WHMO [White House Military Office] policy change regarding the system design,' according to the most recent annual report on the VH-92 program from the Pentagon's Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E), which was released last Friday. DOT&E did not provide specific details about the deficiencies that were addressed. The course does now seem increasingly clear for the VH-92A to take over as Marine One. At the same time, while the VH-3Ds are not scheduled to head off into retirement next year, the VH-60Ns, with their hot-and-high capabilities, have years of service still ahead of them.

Imaging Infrared Seeker For APKWS Guided Rockets Is In The Works	Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II, better known simply as APKWS, is slated to be demonstrated with a passive infrared seeker. The news came in the 2025 Marine Aviation Plan, which states that 'Additional demonstrations are also in [the] work[s] with the Army and Air Force to determine [the] feasibility of adding additional guidance methods to the APKWS family, including passive infrared seekers.' While little is known about this initiative, such a capability could potentially offer a far cheaper solution with independent targeting capabilities compared to existing missiles, while also increasing magazine depth on certain platforms dramatically. BAE Systems' APKWS takes 70mm Hydra unguided air-to-ground rockets with various warhead configurations and fits them with a small laser guidance section between the motor and the warhead. The employment concept is simple, put the laser on the target and fire the rocket within its engagement parameters and it will fly to that target with incredible precision and detonate. They can take out individuals in doorways and vehicles rushing across a roadway, for instance. They also do this at a fraction of the cost of traditional missiles, coming in at around $15,000 to $20,000 apiece for the guidance kit and a few grand more for the warhead and rocket motor. This is compared to hundreds of thousands of dollars, or more, for traditional missiles.

Now, as any sort of cost-per-shot ratio advantages are top of mind in the Pentagon, the precision-guided rockets are seen as a cheap way to take out targets on the ground and, increasingly, in the air, as well. This has led to APKWS' adaptation into a surface-to-air effector, which has seen great success in Ukraine, and now as an air-to-air weapon in its own right.

For an F-16, a seven-shot pod of the rockets more than doubles its air-to-air missile magazine depth while just occupying a single pylon. Still, there are real limitations to APKWS in the anti-air role, whether fired from the ground or the air. It is generally usable against slower-flying drones and some cruise missiles, both of which are largely non-reactionary, non-hard-maneuvering targets. They also require the target to be lased (laser-designated) throughout the rocket's flight. In other words, this is not a 'fire-and-forget' weapon, it needs to have its target illuminated until the warhead detonates. This limits the rapidity of multiple engagements and, especially for air-to-air applications, makes engagements tricky. For the latter, having one aircraft lasing and one firing would help with these limitations, especially considering that the rocket has limited range and speed, and the firing aircraft has to clear any blast fragmentation area quickly in order to not be struck by its own weapon's effects.

This would allow it to lock on before launch and fly to its target autonomously. This means multiple targets could be engaged far faster and, in many cases, in a safer manner. It also means that radar could be used to help initially acquire the target and point the seeker at it prior to firing, both in ground and air-based applications. Think of it as firing a cheaper, shorter-range AIM-9 Sidewinder missile that has a use case not against other high-performance, hard-turning fighters, but for engaging drones and cruise missiles, which mainly fly in straight lines or maneuver at slower speeds and lower g-rates. Costs could be cut by providing a simplified, staring imaging infrared seeker, potentially using commercially available off-the-shelf components. It would not need the range and counter-counter-measure capabilities of the AIM-9X, nor its high-off boresight capabilities. It is also possible that an infrared seeker could be pursued for use in air-to-ground or surface-to-surface applications, as well. This would allow for targets to be engaged passively, without the use of a laser, which can be detected, and is another potential failure point and complication in the targeting process. It would also allow for vehicles to employ the rockets without a laser designator. How exactly an imaging infrared seeker would be fitted into the APKWS is unclear as the small laser seekers are mounted on the forward fins that are part of the guidance section. Maybe small, very basic infrared sensors could be mounted similarly, but it's more likely that putting single seeker in the traditional spot, on the nose, would be the solution, although it may increase expense and limit modularity. In fact, a similar seeker system was already built and tested by the Navy a decade and a half ago. Low-Cost Imaging Terminal Seeker (LCITS) focused on engaging surface targets, especially swarming small boats. So it's not like this hasn't been done before and imaging infrared sensor technology has come a long way in the last 15 years. LCITS ended up becoming something of a joint U.S.-South Korean program that continued development through to today under the Low-cost Guided Imaging Rocket (LOGIR) program primarily intended as a coastal defense system. You can read more about this here. The U.S. could adopt a version of LOGIR system and even work to apply it in the counter-air role, or at least adapt technology it has gleaned from it to APKWS. The bottom line here is that this could be a huge boost, especially in the anti-air role, for APKWS at a time when exactly this kind of cheaper, more plentiful solution is so badly needed to counter drones and lower-end cruise missiles. But even in the surface-to-surface and air-to-surface role alone it could be an exciting development. We will let you know more about the initiative if we hear back from BAE Systems.

Navy HELIOS Laser Aboard USS Preble Zaps Drone In Latest Test	The Navy has disclosed that the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Preble successfully test-fired its High-Energy Laser with Integrated Optical Dazzler and Surveillance (HELIOS) system to take out an aerial target drone in Fiscal Year 2024. It was the latest major demonstration of the surface fleet's shipboard laser ambitions, even as other U.S. military laser efforts have faced a reality check in recent years. Preble's drone zapping was 'to verify and validate the functionality, performance and capability' of HELIOS, and this latest step toward moving shipboard lasers into a fully operational state was revealed in the Pentagon’s annual Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOTE) report that was released Friday night. Little else was disclosed in the DOTE report regarding where and when Preble, a Flight IIA Arleigh Burke subvariant, fired its laser. The warship shifted homeports from San Diego to Japan in September, just a few days before the end of FY24. TWZ has reached out to the Navy for more information on the test and where HELIOS currently stands, and this report will be updated when that information comes in. A rendering of the HELIOS system in action aboard a Navy destroyer. (Lockheed Martin) Either way, it’s a capability that Navy brass has been increasingly clamoring for, especially in the past year, as Navy warships shoot down an at-times daily barrage of drones and missiles fired by Iran-backed Houthi rebels over the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. Those battles and other global flashpoints have raised continued concerns about the Navy draining its finite missile stocks, as the pacing threat of China looms on the horizon. TWZ has reported on several aspects of the Navy’s battle against the Houthis, including a tally of ordnance expended during more than 400 engagements against the Houthi arsenal of aerial drones, anti-ship cruise missiles, and anti-ship ballistic missiles. 'When I was in Bahrain as [the Destroyer Squadron 50 commanding officer] 10 years ago, the afloat staging base USS Ponce had a laser on it,' Naval Surfaces Forces commander Vice Adm. Brendan McLane told reporters in early 2024, before the Surface Navy Association conference. 'We’re 10 years down the road, and we still don’t have something we can field?' Indeed, the 60-kilowatt HELIOS and other long-promised directed-energy weapons have been a long time coming for the surface fleet. As TWZ previously reported, it was first spotted aboard Preble in 2022. Its debut predates the Houthi fight, but is the type of system that would seem primed to help, at least to a limited degree, ease missile expenditures during similar operations. The High-Energy Laser with Integrated Optical Dazzler and Surveillance (HELIOS) laser directed energy weapon installed on the Navy destroyer USS Preble, with an inset showing a rendering of the system. (U.S. Navy/Lockheed Martin) TWZ’s past reporting on HELIOS points to why it would be so useful for taking out drone attacks and disabling or destroying small boats. both manned and unmanned, with nefarious intent. It can also serve as a 'dazzler' to blind or confuse optical seekers on incoming missiles and drones. The dazzler can limit an opponent’s general situational awareness by denying their sensors the ability to surveil the ship. HELIOS also sports its own optical sensors, which can serve a secondary intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) role. On Preble, HELIOS sits on the warship’s main forward pedestal that hosted the Mk 15 Phalanx Close-In Weapons System (CIWS) on earlier Arleigh Burke class destroyer variants. Flight IIA destroyers currently have only one CIWS installed above the hangar bay. Outside of the handful of destroyers modified to the ‘Rota configuration,’ which feature SeaRAM and Phalanx, Flight I Arleigh Burkes feature two CIWS, front and rear. The Phalanx Close-In Weapons System (CIWS). (U.S. Navy) Lockheed Martin received its first contract from the Navy for work on HELIOS in 2018, but the system builds on a much longer history of directed energy research and development at the company. The system is particularly powerful when paired with the Aegis Combat System. Rich Calabrese, Director of Surface Navy Mission Systems for Lockheed Martin, expounded on HELIOS and Aegis during a broader interview with The War Zone in 2021: 'We’re continuously upgrading the multi-source integration infusion capability of the Aegis weapon system and looking to bring in new weapons and sensors and do coordinated hard kill and soft kill. Directed energy weapons… We’re really already integrating the HELIOS Laser Weapon System with the Aegis Weapon System CSL [Common Source Library] in our lab here in New Jersey. In fact, we’ve… The guy who’s now managing the laser program… He let me know the other day that we recently fired a laser here under the control of the Aegis Weapon System computer program. So, we’re building in the capability to do that weapon coordination and to do the hard kill, soft kill coordination in an automated fashion working with the HELIOS Weapon System.' The HELIOS laser system sits on a pedestal in front of the USS Preble's bridge. (U.S. Navy) Petty Officer 2nd Class Malcolm Kelley Lockheed Martin is contracted to deliver at least one more HELIOS system for an Arleigh Burke. Company officials said they designed the system with future capability growth in mind as well, including increasing the system’s maximum power up to 150 kilowatts. Such a power level would allow HELIOS to more rapidly down smaller drones at longer ranges and take on bigger and more complex threats, such as anti-ship cruise missiles and even enemy aircraft, albeit still at relatively shorter distances. The Navy and Lockheed Martin demonstrated the ability of a solid-state laser directed energy weapon to successfully shoot down a target drone acting as a surrogate for a subsonic cruise missile in 2022, using a weapon called the Laser Layered Defense (LLD) system during a test at the U.S. Army’s White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. HELIOS constitutes one facet of the Navy’s directed energy ambitions, which are now set to eventually include high-power microwave-based systems as well. Fellow destroyers, including the USS Dewey and USS Stockdale, are now equipped with the less powerful Optical Dazzling Interdictor, Navy (ODIN). Unlike HELIOS, ODIN’s laser can only be used as a dazzler, but it also has secondary surveillance capabilities. In late 2021, the year before HELIOS debuted aboard the Preble, the San Antonio class amphibious transport dock ship USS Portland engaged a static surface target with its laser directed energy weapon in the Gulf of Aden. That system, known as the Laser Weapon System Demonstrator Mk 2 Mod 0, was placed aboard Portland in late 2019, which The War Zone was first to report, and subsequently used to knock down a small drone in a demonstration in the Pacific Ocean in 2020. All told, the Pentagon is spending an average of $1 billion annually to develop such weapons for ships, aircraft and ground vehicles, Navy Times reported last year. But figuring out how to develop, procure and field such technology has proven challenging, according to a 2023 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report. The Navy amphibious transport dock USS Portland uses a laser to strike a static surface target in 2021. (U.S. Navy) The Defense Department has struggled to get 'these technologies out of the lab and into the field' for a number of reasons, including difficulty in determining how the force would use them during missions, according to the federal watchdog. 'Without early transition planning and drafting transition agreements, the Navy risks developing technology that is misaligned with operational needs,' the report warned. The realities of actually deploying and sustaining advanced laser weapons in the field, and just how effective they can be at this time, are also becoming clearer. These revelations have led to the DoD stepping back from some key, long-touted, laser weapons programs recently. The U.S. Air Force scrapped plans to flight test a laser directed energy weapon on an AC-130J Ghostrider gunship. (U.S. Air Force) Generally, laser weapon systems are chronically over-hyped, especially in the mainstream media, compared to what they can realistically achieve. Laser weapons can only engage one target at a time and they need to dwell on that target steadily for a prolonged period to have an effect, especially lower power-class examples that are fielded today. They also have power and thermal limitations which impact how many shots they can fire back-to-back. Their range is limited and impacted by atmospheric conditions and their components are delicate and hardening them for hash military use is an ongoing process. So, even in a naval sense, while they still are a very attractive capability, they are for low-volume point defense cases against very limited target sets for the foreseeable future. The Navy destroyer USS Preble arrives at its new homeport in Yokosuka, Japan, in October. (U.S. Navy) Those realities haven't stopped Navy brass from continuing to hammer the need for shipboard lasers. U.S. Fleet Forces Command head Adm. Daryl Caudle lamented the glacial pace of laser development at last month's Surface Navy Association annual symposium, Breaking Defense's Justin Katz reported. 'There’s been many a thesis and dissertation written on building lasers on ships, but we’ve not transitioned that into a place where that’s an acceptable way to actually take out missile systems,' Katz quoted Caudle as saying. 'These things are based on renewable energy, so I can recharge the system … I don’t have to worry about payload [or] volume with directed energy. All those things are appealing to a navy, [but] we just haven’t really matriculated that into a place … that’s ready for prime time,' Caudle continued. Even as the Navy proceeds with shipboard laser programs like HELIOS, the timing as to when they will actually become a widespread and robust capability remains unclear. Still, recent events are likely to only increase pressure to make shipboard laser weapons a commonplace reality within the U.S. Navy.

F/A-18’s Infrared Search And Track System Has 'Significant Reliab...	The U.S. Navy’s podded Infrared Search And Track System, or IRST, planned for its F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighters, has 'demonstrated significant reliability problems during operational testing,' according to the Pentagon. The ASG-34A(V)1 IRST Block II, seen as a key part of the Navy’s ability to retain its air-to-air advantage over potential adversaries, was first flown on a Super Hornet in late 2019 and TWZ had previously reported on delays caused by production quality issues with the system. The Office of the Director, Operational Test & Evaluation, in its latest Annual Report, provides an update on the status of the IRST Block II pod, which completed operational testing in the fourth quarter of FY24. These tests involved Infrared Optimized Configuration (IROC) pods, described as 'operationally equivalent' but designated for flight test. A Lockheed Martin infographic showing different applications for its IRST2 1 sensor, including the podded version for the Navy F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. Lockheed Martin While finishing up operational testing is a significant milestone, it’s tempered by the fact that, according to the report, 'operational test events were adversely affected by IRST Block II system reliability failures.' Data analysis is ongoing. As we have discussed before, including with the Super Hornet program manager, the centerline-mounted F/A-18E/F IRST pod provides the aircraft with a long-wave infrared sensor — the Lockheed Martin-developed IRST21 — that can search, detect, and track airborne targets. Very importantly, it is an ideal tool for detecting stealthy targets, which are proliferating. The IRST sensor assembly is installed in the front portion of a redesigned FPU-13/A centerline fuel tank. A conceptual diagram of how the IRST sensor is mounted in the fuel tank for the Super Hornet. Lockheed Martin Very importantly, the IRST pod provides an entirely passive capability, relying exclusively on the infrared spectrum to detect and track airborne targets, including those at far beyond visual range. With no radio-frequency emissions, the target won’t be alerted to the fact that they’ve been detected and are being tracked. At the same time, the IRST does not give away the location and presence of the host platform. This kind of sensor also provides a vital companion to the Super Hornet’s AN/APG-79 radar, functions of which may well be compromised in a heavy electronic attack or radar-denied environment. At the same time, the IRST Block II pod still contains fuel to extend the Super Hornet’s range, although this is trimmed from 480 gallons to 340 gallons once the sensor is fitted. In terms of the timeline for the system, developmental testing was conducted during FY23 and FY24, followed by initial operational test and evaluation (IOT&E) between April and September 2024, with the IROC pods, in support of full-rate production. In the meantime, however, earlier iterations of the pod had already been deployed on operations, carried by Super Hornets in the Middle East, with photos emerging of this in late 2020.

U.S. Air Force photo by Staff Sgt. James Merriman Staff Sgt. James Merriman When it comes to the suitability of the pod for full operational fielding, the report provides the following comments: In an operational context, the report notes that the IRST pod is seen as a complementary sensor to the AN/APG-79 'to support the guidance of beyond-visual-range air-to-air missiles,' either operating autonomously or in combination with other sensors. The missiles mentioned are the AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) and the AIM-9X Sidewinder Block II. 'IRST Block II demonstrated significant reliability problems during operational testing. Throughout the test period, IRST Block II suffered from hardware and software deficiencies, which required the aircrew to restart the pod multiple times. Troubleshooting and repair often exceeded the abilities of Navy maintenance crews and required assistance from Lockheed Martin. Many of these problems were discovered during integrated and operational test after the Navy completed a minimal developmental test program with the representative hardware. Additional details will be provided in DOT&E’s classified IOT&E report.' Despite these problems, the report notes that the test events were 'adequate to provide an assessment of the long-range detection and tracking capability, suitability, and cyber survivability' of the pod. Specifically, test events saw the pod being used against 'operationally relevant targets' at 'tactically relevant detection ranges.' Here, the pod demonstrated that it could translate long-range target detections into stable system tracks that would be suitable for weapons employment. The Lockheed Martin IRST21 sensor, as used in the Navy Super Hornet IRST pod. Lockheed Martin However, there is clearly still work to be done, with the report adding that the Navy 'must continue to improve the F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet’s operating software and address existing deficiencies to effectively integrate IRST into aircraft fire control solutions.' The Pentagon hopes that the Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) pods, which were planned to be delivered starting in September 2024 'may have increased reliability' and will 'improve lethality and survivability in air superiority missions against advanced threats.' As well as the reliability deficiencies outlined in this latest report, the Pentagon also notes that more work needs to be done to address IRST Block II and Super Hornet operating software deficiencies that had been recommended in the last such document, in FY23. Previous issues with the pod were also highlighted by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), in its 2023 Report to Congressional Committees. This earlier report noted that 'between 20 and 30 percent of the manufactured components [in the IRST pod] failed to meet performance specifications due to microelectronics issues.' These problems persisted more than four years after limited manufacturing had begun and served to delay the launch of developmental and operational testing. The 2023 report also highlighted the fact that 'staffing challenges' at a critical software development contractor were also leading to holdups in the program.

James Merriman Staff Sgt. James Merriman In the past, we have looked extensively at the advantages the IRST Block II pod will bring to the Super Hornet community and the Navy’s tactical aviation branch as a whole. The key arguments in favor of the Navy introducing an IRST capability on its Super Hornets are worth recalling. In particular, with China identified as the ‘pacing’ military threat, such capabilities will be fundamental to any future conflict in the Pacific theater. China is making rapid developments in stealth technology and advanced electronic warfare, two areas that make the introduction of an IRST sensor all the more compelling. These kinds of infrared sensors are immune to radar-evading stealth technology and are not affected by electromagnetic jamming and other electronic attacks. The Chinese diamond-shaped, stealthy, heavy tactical combat aircraft design, tentatively known as the J-36, which surprisingly appeared late last year. via X As well as being used as a targeting sensor, an IRST can also considerably enhance the flight crew’s situational air-to-air ‘picture’ in conjunction with more traditional sensors. The delays and problems with the Navy’s IRST pod are all the more alarming considering that the Air Force has already put equivalent sensors on its F-15Cs and F-16Cs. It should be noted, however, that the reliability of the Air Force’s IRST pods isn’t entirely clear at this point. The Legion IRST pod on a U.S. Air Force F-16: Even the contractor-operated adversary community is increasingly flying fast jets with IRST sensors. This is before we come to potential adversaries, such as China and Russia, which operate tactical fighters such as the Su-35 and Su-30 Flanker series that incorporate IRST sensors as standard. The Navy will be hoping that problems with its IRST pod are overcome sooner rather than later, as there’s little doubt that a system of this kind is now badly needed.

Escalating Trade War Raises Questions Over Canada’s F-35 Future	With Canada and the United States now locked in a rapidly escalating trade war, questions are being asked about the effect this could have on Ottawa’s plans to buy the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, as well as how the broader program could be impacted, bearing in mind the not inconsiderable involvement of Canadian industry. Looking first at the background to the trade war, U.S. President Donald Trump announced last week a 25 percent levy on Canadian and Mexican imports to the United States (as well as an additional 10 percent on China). Almost all goods will be affected, with Trump citing his concerns about illegal immigration and drug trafficking as the basis for the move. At the same time, Trump has also lambasted trade imbalances and unfair trade practices as major drivers behind this policy. U.S. President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on January 31, 2025. On this occasion, Trump spoke to reporters about tariffs against China, Canada, and Mexico. Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla In response, Canada announced its own retaliatory tariffs against the United States, putting a 25 percent levy on a range of U.S. goods. 'We don’t want to be here, we didn’t ask for this,' Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said. He added that he would 'not back down in standing up for Canadians,' while warning that the tariffs would impact people’s lives on both sides of the border. To give an idea of the deeply interconnected nature of the economies of the three North American countries, around $2 billion worth of manufactured goods are estimated to cross their borders each day. Trump has said he’s willing to increase the duties further if the countries in question retaliate to his tariffs, as Canada has done. What’s unclear at this point is whether the tariffs will affect the F-35 — as well as a raft of other military items that are sold between the United States and Canada. There have already been suggestions, however, that Canada might want to look elsewhere for its new fighters, in a snub to the United States. The future of Canada’s P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft procurement has also been questioned. An artist’s concept of a P-8A Poseidon in Canadian colors. Boeing In a comment provided to TWZ, Russell Goemaere, Public Affairs Officer at the F-35 Joint Program Office said: 'At this time, we are assessing impacts of any tariffs and will work with the government and our industry partners on the way forward.' When asked this weekend about the prospects of a rethink on of the acquisitions of the F-35 and P-8, David Eby, the premier of British Columbia, said: 'The prime minister will speak for the national approach… For major defense expenditures, which I know is a priority for the Americans, for the president, he wants to see Canada putting additional money into defense, well, we are all happy to do that work together, but these tariffs will force Canada into procuring from other countries.' But an exit route from the F-35 program will be far easier said than done for Canada. Canada finalized a deal with the U.S. government and Lockheed Martin for the procurement of 88 F-35As in January 2023, with the expectation that these would start to be delivered in 2026. You can read our report from March 2022 on Canada’s original selection of the F-35 to replace its fleet of aging CF-18 Hornets, as part of the Future Fighter Capability Project, here. Infographic outlining the key features of Canada’s future F-35As. RCAF The finalization of the deal appeared to bring to an end a long and fraught procurement process. Back in 2010, Canada’s Conservative government announced plans to buy 65 F-35As. Then, once Trudeau’s Liberal Party took power in 2015, an F-35 buy looked to have been ruled out. Amid very public criticism of the choice of the Joint Strike Fighter, Trudeau also made a pre-election promise that he would not purchase the F-35 if he was elected. For a while, it seemed that the F-35 was excluded from the Future Fighter Capability Project and plans were drawn up to buy a smaller number of F/A-18E/F Super Hornets as 'interim' fighter jets instead. At that point, an earlier trade dispute between the Canadian government and Boeing led to the F/A-18E/F being kicked out of the competition in December 2021. By this stage, the only other contender in the competition was Saab’s Gripen E, which the Swedish company had offered to build in Canada, in an effort to secure support for its bid. Saab Gripen E. Saab Two other European candidates, the Eurofighter Typhoon, and the Dassault Rafale, both left the competition before it had begun, complaining that the process unfairly favored U.S. companies. Finally, in March 2022, the F-35 was announced as Ottawa’s preferred selection. The Canadian government has said it expects to invest $19 billion in the F-35 project, a figure that has steadily climbed (in March 2022 the estimate was put at between $12 billion and $15 billion). Canada has been a part of @thef35 program from the very beginning.Today, we're honoured to share the official selection of the #F35 and mark a new era of partnership and prosperity with Canadians as the program strengthens opportunities for continued economic growth.&mdash; Lockheed Martin Canada (@LMCanadaNews) January 9, 2023 While the first F-35 for Canada is not scheduled to be handed over until next year, Ottawa has already invested heavily in the program. At the time that the Future Fighter Capability Project was launched in 2017, Canada had long been paying into the F-35 program as an industrial partner. Canada has been a member of the F-35 program from the very start, initially as a Level 3 industrial partner, without a firm commitment to buy any actual aircraft. Indeed, between 1997 and 2021, Canadian investment in the Joint Strike Fighter amounted to $613 million. All this helped Canadian firms secure dozens of contracts related to the F-35’s development and production. By 2019, these contracts had already brought a combined total of more than $1.3 billion into the Canadian economy. Furthermore, Canadian companies are eligible to bid on F-35-related contracts throughout the service life of the aircraft. Lockheed Martin Ultimately, it was this major industrial stake in the F-35 that meant the stealth fighter was also expected to be the front-runner in any formal competition in Canada. It’s a dynamic, which, in turn, makes it singularly difficult for Canada to extract itself from the F-35 program. However, there is a precedent. Turkey, which also had a significant industrial stake in the Joint Strike Fighter, found itself removed from the program over its refusal to give up a planned purchase of Russian-made S-400 air defense systems. Canada has already made significant investments in new infrastructure to accommodate the F-35, including the construction of fighter squadron facilities at 3 Wing in Bagotville, Quebec, and 4 Wing in Cold Lake, Alberta. This, taken together with industrial aspects, as well a major need for the aircraft makes it seem unlikely that Ottawa will scrap its plans to buy F-35s, despite previous flip-flopping on the issue. No other aircraft available today offers the same package of capabilities as the F-35, either. Last week, in a post on LinkedIn, the Canadian Association of Defense and Security Industries (CADSI) warned that 'any U.S. tariffs applied to Canadian defense exports would have a significant negative impact on our members, and on the highly integrated Canada-U.S. defense industrial base.' A U.S. Air Force F-35A performs during the 2023 Abbotsford International Airshow in British Columbia, Canada, on August 12, 2023. Photo by Liang Sen/Xinhua via Getty Images Xinhua News Agency More than a hundred Canadian companies provide components for the F-35, with one of them — the Ottawa-based Gastops — being a sole-source supplier, responsible for Oil Debris Monitor (ODM) engine sensors. This means that Gastops products are found in every single F-35 that is built. Other Canadian manufacturers supply F-35 components, on a non-sole-source basis that include wing bulkheads, keel beams, horizontal tails, landing gear, circuit cards, electro-hydraulic actuation systems, weapons bay door inserts, power and thermal management system controllers, and more. Ultimately, the F-35 is just one example of a U.S. defense program that Canada benefits from in terms of defense exports, which will not be hit by the new tariffs. There are many more such programs. Canada does not provide metrics for military exports to the U.S. annually, but estimates put it well over $1B a year. The potential removal of F-35-related revenues from this total would be a significant blow, but the loss of Canada's fighter business to the U.S., as well as disruptions in its supply chain that could also occur, would be of a higher monetary value. On the other hand, Trudeau’s tariffs launched in response to those from the United States will not immediately impact defense industries. The first raft of Canadian tariffs apply to U.S.-made consumer products like liquor, vegetables, clothing, household appliances, furniture, and sports equipment.

Consideration has also been given to legislation that would prevent U.S. companies from bidding on government contracts, which could effectively shut off the Canadian market to U.S. defense contractors. Overall, it remains unclear exactly how the F-35 program let alone the wider defense-industrial relationship between Canada and the United States will be affected by the current trade war. What’s clear is that the CF-18 badly needs replacement and any further holdup in the Future Fighter Capability Project would be very unwelcome news for the Canadian military. Were Canada to abandon its plans to buy the F-35, it would derail its fighter replacement timeline and a new effort would need to be restarted yet again. There is also a significant symbolic value for Canada, which is spending billions on a stealth fighter from a country that is actively fighting a trade war with it and which has the potential to crash its economy. There is also the issue of the supportability of the F-35. Canada is investing hugely in a strategic resource that needs constant support from its U.S. supplier, and this could be disrupted suddenly at the whim of the U.S. government, should it so wish. All these actions are also being watched closely by other U.S. arms customers overseas. Trump is threatening to enact the same tariffs on at least some of its European allies, as well.

But the longer the tariffs remain in place, the stronger the responses will be as political pressures mount.

Hunt For A MV-22 Osprey Successor For The Marines Has Begun	A newly released U.S. Marine Aviation Plan shows the service is now looking at a successor to its MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotors actively enough to give it a name: the Next Generation Assault Support (NGAS) aircraft. The Marines have previously said that they expect the Osprey to serve into the 2060s, but have left the door open for that to change depending on other developments. The V-22 series has long been a controversial aircraft with sporadic limitations imposed on its operations, but has been facing notably increased scrutiny following a three-month-long grounding last year prompted by a fatal crash of a U.S. Air Force CV-22. The U.S. Marine Corps released its latest Aviation Plan, the first it has put out publicly since 2022, earlier today. As of March 2024, the Marines had a total of 348 MV-22s in inventory and the service's objective fleet size is 360 aircraft. Marine Ospreys are currently assigned to units in the United States, as well as ones forward deployed in Japan and Djibouti. A US Marine Corps MV-22 Osprey. USMC 'Configuration, inventory, and supply chain management remain the top areas of focus as the MV-22B Osprey fleet right-sizes to meet future requirements and challenges,' the Osprey second the 2025 Aviation Plan says. The document highlights various ongoing modernization efforts, including plans to integrate new electronic warfare, communications, survivability, and Degraded Visual Environment (DVE) flight capabilities. It also notes continued safety and reliability-related work, including improvements to the proprotor gearbox that was at the center of the crash that led to last year's fleet-wide grounding. A larger Renewed V-22 Aircraft Modernization Plan (ReVAMP) 'will ensure platform relevance until the end of its service life and the development and fielding of the Next Generation Assault Support (NGAS) aircraft,' the new aviation plan adds. The Marines announced last year that they had begun initial studies into what ReVAMP might entail, including the potential for the total replacement of major structural components like wings and engine nacelles, as well as other upgrades and modifications. The Marine Corps does not appear to have previously disclosed the existence of the NGAS effort and the 2025 Aviation Plan provides no further details. TWZ has reached out to the Marines and to the U.S. Navy's Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), the latter of which serves as the central manager for major aviation programs for both services, for more information. NAVAIR also leads the V-22 Joint Program Office (JPO) overseeing the entire U.S. military Osprey family, which includes Air Force CV-22s and Navy CMV-22s. The JPO supports foreign Osprey operators, of which Japan is currently the only one, as well. A Japanese MV-22 (in the foreground) flies together with a US Marine Corps Osprey (at rear). USMC However, the basic fact of the existence of NGAS is still notable given that the Marines have pushed back when asked about planning for a V-22 successor in the past. 'It has a service life for many more years. &#8230; we're approaching in the next couple of years service-level decisions on what we do at kind of a mid-life of the V-22,' Marine Brig. Gen. Richard Joyce, Assistant Deputy Commandant for Aviation, said during a press call in March 2024 in response to a question from this author on what might come after Osprey. 'There is no taking our eye off of V-22 and the years of service like what it has in front of us.' The Marines had made Brig. Gen. Joyce available to speak TWZ and other reporters at that time about the lifting of the three-month-long grounding of V-22s following the fatal CV-22 crash, which had occurred off the coast of Japan in December 2023. A pair of US Air Force CV-22 Ospreys. USAF 'We are not having conversations right now about anything that replaces V-22. We're always thinking deep, 2040 and beyond right now, for sure. And then we are acutely focused on our V-22,' Joyce added. 'We're not talking about replacing V-22. We're thinking deep and we're focused on V-22 at mid-life.' 'ReVAMP is kind of the next cycle of this thing. So, you're going to see V-22s darkening the skies for, you know, the next 30 or 40 years without question,' Marine Col. Brian Taylor, then head of the V-22 Joint Program Office, also told TWZ and other attendees at the Modern Day Marine exhibition in April 2024. 'There is a ton of life left in this platform, and there is a ton of mission left in this platform.' Still, 'once we do this [the initial ReVAMP studies], the other question kind of goes back to the service of 'hey, is this where you want to invest? Or is there something completely different?'' Taylor added. 'So, you know, I'm a little bit biased, I would love to see the V-22 stay in service, you know, for the next 100 years. But if there's a better thing that we need to pivot to that's really kind of up to the services.' Tyler explicitly mentioned the High-Speed Vertical Takeoff and Landing (HSVTOL) program, which is a U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) effort exploring future VTOL concepts offering significant speed and range capabilities. HSVTOL is paired with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Speed and Runway Independent Technologies (SPRINT) program. Aurora Flight Sciences, a Boeing subsidiary, and Bell are currently developing demonstrator designs for SPRINT. A rendering of Aurora Flight Sciences SPRINT demonstrator, at left, alongside a larger design concept based on the same technology, at right. Aurora Flight Sciences A rendering of design concepts based on technology Bell has been developing for SPRINT and HSVTOL. Bell For its part, Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) has long lauded the unique capabilities its CV-22s offer, but also has made no secret of its view that the Osprey is an increasingly dated design. A Bell/Boeing team started the development of the Osprey back in the 1980s and there were suffered numerous serious setbacks before the Marines finally became the first service to start flying them operationally in 2007. 'The CV-22, it's been a unique capability that the special operations enterprise has always needed,' Air Force Gen. Tony D. Bauernfeind, then head of AFSOC, also told TWZ and other reporters at the time of the lifting of the grounding last March. At the same time, 'the V-22 is still 1980s, first-generation tilt-rotor technology. And we're in 2024.' Increased range, as well as greater speed to help get across those distances faster, will be key considerations for the Marine's NGAS effort, especially with an eye toward a future high-end in the Pacific against China. The Corps has touted its ability to conduct long-range and long-endurance MV-22 operations in the Pacific Region, but this presents significant challenges and resource requirements, especially when it comes to aerial refueling, as you can read more about here. Those issues would only be magnified in an actual conflict against an opponent with substantial anti-access and area denial capabilities. The same kinds of considerations have been driving SPRINT/HSVTOL and also played a major role in the U.S. Army's decision to pick a design based on Bell's advanced V-280 Valor tilt-rotor as the winner of its Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) competition. The V-280 already incorporated significant lessons Bell learned from the V-22, as you can learn more about in this past TWZ feature. FLRAA aircraft are now set to replace a substantial part of the Army's H-60 Black Hawk fleets, including special operations MH-60 variants in service with the elite 160th Special Operation Aviation Regiment (SOAR). There has been talk about a potential Marine variant or derivative of FLRAA in the past, which could be another route to an MV-22 successor in addition to leveraging SPRINT/HSVTOL. At the same time, the MV-22 currently offers features important to the Marines, such as a folding main wing and rotors to meet shipboard space requirements and a rear ramp that helps with the loading and unloading of larger cargoes, not found on the FLRAA design. It could be complicated to incorporate those and other elements into a Marine version. It's also worth noting that the Marines have looked at the V-280's smaller uncrewed cousin, the V-247 Vigilant, to meet separate requirements to provide additional strike and other capabilities. Since at least 2021, the Navy has been exploring options for replacing at least a portion of its H-60 Seahawk variants, along with its MQ-8B/C Fire Scout drone helicopters, as part of an effort called Future Vertical Lift-Maritime Strike (FVL-MS), as well. Any Marine discussions about the future of the MV-22 now also come amid serious new scrutiny of the entire Osprey program following last year's grounding, including from members of Congress on both sides of the political aisle. Much of the Osprey fleet was just grounded again briefly in December following another mishap involving a CV-22. 'As the backbone of Marine Corps combat assault transport capability, MV-22B squadrons have conducted a total of 109 operational deployments and flown over 588,000 flight hours since 2007. The MV-22B flies approximately twice as many flight hours per year as any other Marine Corps rotary-wing aircraft,' the Marine Corps 2025 Aviation Plan does note, reiterating long-standing talking points about the checked record. 'The MV-22 maintains mishap rates on par with other Marine Aviation assets. As of 1 August 2024, the MV-22’s 10-year (2014-2024) Class A mishap rate is 3.15 per every 100,000 flights [sic] hours, lower than the Marine Corps average of 3.24.' There is considerable uncertainty around the general outlook for U.S. defense spending under the new Trump administration, as well. Though much remains to be learned about the Marine Corps NGAS plans, the service is now formally looking ahead to what comes after the MV-22. Update: 2:30 PM EST – The U.S. Marine Corps has now provided additional information about the NGAS plan and the future outlook for the service's MV-22s. 'The Next Generation Assault Support (NGAS) will fit within Project Eagle, which is Marine Aviation’s strategic approach over the next three Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) cycles to feed the Requirements and Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) process. The Capability Development Document (CDD) development phase for the NGAS is forecasted for the early 2030s, which will guide Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) and prototyping beginning in the mid-2030s,' a spokesperson for the Marine Corps' top headquarters at the Pentagon told TWZ. 'Early material solution analysis is ongoing as Marine Aviation closely follows the Army’s Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) program and considers technology development initiatives within the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and across industry. Digital engineering, open architectures, and a modernized acquisition approach will underline Headquarters Marine Corps (HQMC) and Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Experimental Modernization and Advanced Development Team (XMA-ADT)’s strategy towards capability development and fielding of NGAS.' 'The V-22 Osprey is anticipated to remain in service through 2055. This extended operational timeline is supported by ongoing modernization efforts aimed at addressing specific capability and reliability requirements,' the Marine spokesperson added. 'These efforts include component replacement, system redesign, and predictive maintenance initiatives to enhance platform reliability and support the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) and Joint Force in future operating environments. Modernization initiatives will ensure that the V-22 continues to meet the evolving needs of the Marine Corps, providing critical medium lift assault support capabilities well into the future.'
