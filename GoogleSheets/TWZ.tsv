Crisis Brewing Over Air Force’s Future Air Dominance Plans Which ...	The future outlook for the U.S. Air Force's top modernization efforts is even more uncertain after the service's civilian boss openly questioned the affordability of buying any combination of new stealth fighters, advanced aerial refueling tankers, and highly autonomous drones. A deep review of plans to acquire a new sixth-generation crewed stealth combat jet is already underway, the results of which are set to have much broader ramifications. Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall made deeply concerning pronouncements about the state of the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative, as well as the Next Generation Air Refueling System (NGAS) effort, at the Airlift/Tanker Association's (ATA) annual symposium last Friday. The Air Force's sixth-generation combat jet program, also referred to as the NGAD or Penetrating Counter-Air (PCA) 'platform,' and its Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drone program, sit under the larger NGAD umbrella.

Collins Aerospace 'You may also have heard that the Department of the Air Force is reconsidering the Next Generation Air Dominance platform, the NGAD platform, our sixth-generation fighter. This isn't entirely accurate, or at least it is incomplete,' Kendall said during a keynote address at the ATA gathering. 'We are actually looking hard at the combination of the Next Generation Air Dominance platform, the Increment Two uncrewed Collaborative Combat Aircraft, and the Next Generation Aerial Refueling System, all in an Agile Combat Employment context.' The Air Force is currently running the CCA effort in incremental development cycles. General Atomics and Anduril are currently developing designs as part of Increment 1. Requirements for Increment 2, which could be dramatically different, are still being finalized. The stated plan previously was to launch the Increment 2 CCA competition sometime in Fiscal Year 2025, which began on October 1. A model of General Atomics’ CCA design. Jamie Hunter A model of Anduril's Fury design, which it is now developing under Increment 1 of the CCA program. Jamie Hunter When it comes to NGAS, the Air Force has consistently described it as a 'system of systems,' a core component of which has long been expected to be a new stealthy crewed tanker. Agile Combat Employment (ACE) collectively refers to a set of concepts of operations the Air Force has been developing in recent years that focus heavily on being able to deploy and redeploy forces quickly and in irregular ways, including to far-flung operating locations. The central objective behind ACE is to make it difficult for opponents to predict the movement of friendly forces and target them, while also reducing reliance on large established bases that are expected to be top targets during any future high-end fight. 'These three potential new designs and platforms are all tied together, both operationally and from an affordability perspective. We are working through a sprint of about four months of effort to determine the best combination of capabilities to pursue at various investment levels,' Kendall continued in his keynote. 'The variable that concerns me most as we go through this analysis and produce a range of alternatives is going to be [the availability of adequate resources.] &#8230; to pursue any combination of those new designs.' 'Right now, given our commitments, our resources, and strategic priorities, it's hard for me to see how we can afford any combination of those new designs,' Kendall added bluntly. Cost is already well known to be the central driver behind the review of the NGAD combat jet, which the Air Force hopes will wrap up before the end of the year. Initial estimates had put the unique cost of the aircraft in the region of $300 million or more. Kendall has repeatedly expressed a desire to cut that by a whopping two thirds, closer to that of a current generation F-35 stealth fighter, possibly by refocusing the design around a much more limited set of roles and missions, especially acting as a forward controller for CCA drones. You can read more about what that could look like in this past War Zone feature. It's also worth remembering that Chief of Staff of the Air Force Gen. David Allvin, the service's top officer, showed an artificial intelligence-generated rendering of a notional light stealth fighter, seen below, ostensibly a thought exercise, during a presentation at the Global Air and Space Chiefs Conference earlier this year. At the more recent 2024 Military Reporters & Editors (MRE) Conference last month, Allvin said that the B-21 Raider stealth bomber taking on a greater 'air dominance' role depending on the outcome of the NGAD combat jet review had not been 'taken &#8230; off the table,' as well. YouTube capture The Air Force also previously disclosed the intersection of the NGAD combat jet, Increment 2 CCA, and NGAS plans, which was not surprising to begin with. The NGAD 'fighter' has long been presented as an important future 'quarterback' for CCAs, but there has also been some uncertainty around exactly how those drones will be utilized, in general. The Air Force recently pushed back on assertions from Lockheed Martin that the Increment 1 CCAs would likely be more experimental than operational in nature. Lockheed Martin was notably not chosen to proceed in the initial phase of the CCA program, having, by its own admission, proposed an advanced, but also extremely costly design. At the same time, in the past year or so, the Air Force has notably walked back its language about its plans for the CCA fleets, especially their size. When the program was first announced, the Air Force's stated goal was to buy as many as 1,000 of those drones, if not many more. It has since been clarified that this figure reflects the expected CCA fleet size across all increments. In April, Secretary Kendall said that he expected there to be just around '100 [aircraft] on order or delivered' under Increment 1 by the end of the decade, at which point the hope is that they will have entered operational service. Chief of Staff Allvin has also since put forward a 150 airframe figure for Increment 1. How many more drones from subsequent increments may also be on hand or on the way by 2030 is unknown. In addition, the final design of the NGAD combat jet, as well as that of future CCAs, will have clear and direct implications for what it will take refueling-wise to support their operations. When it comes to future tankers, The War Zone has already been highlighting for years the increasingly critical need for more survivable refueling platforms, especially to support stealthy aircraft operating in highly contested environments. A rendering of a notional stealth tanker refueling an F-35. Lockheed Martin Skunk Works 'Essentially the threat, China again, has reached out with new counter-air systems that could threaten our aircraft, especially tankers, at longer ranges, beyond the ranges which we normally would refuel fighter planes,' Kendall said at the ATA symposium. 'This put our whole tanker acquisition strategy in question. It is still in question, but we are working to resolve the uncertainty as quickly as possible.' Operational range considerations have long been shaping up to be especially central factors in air combat planning around a potential future large-scale conflict in the Pacific against China, including for CCA drones, some of which may or may not ultimately have aerial refueling capability. 'You have to understand the geography, the nature of the environment within which you would use' CCAs, Chief of Staff Allvin said at the MRE conference in October, highlighting the particular 'tyranny of distance' involved in any operations in the Pacific. Earlier this year, the Air Force's top officer detailed plans for a new large-force exercise next summer focused heavily on just testing the service's ability to get forces where they need to be in the region relatively rapidly. A map relating to the planned REFORPAC large-scale exercise set to take place in summer 2025. Note the deployment timelines measured in days, underscoring the challenges of rapidly pushing forces forward in the region. USAF via Hudson Institute 'We must have a more resilient tanking capability. There are a number of ways to accomplish this,' Kendall added in his keynote last week. 'A new design, purpose-built tanker – NGAS – is one of them. Unfortunately, any new design cannot be fielded for several years at best, even if affordable.' Any new stealthy tanker design might also be pilot-optional or even entirely uncrewed. Crewed and uncrewed tankers of various kinds could also deliver fuel to receivers via a hub-and-spoke concept, with more survivable aerial refuelers ferrying gas to areas closer to the tactical edge. The Air Force is also exploring new ‘buddy store’ podded aerial refueling systems compatible with aircraft that use the boom method, which is the service's preferred way for getting gas into aircraft in flight. This might allow for even existing fighter-sized aircraft to help support refueling operations. 'Other options include various ways of increasing the resilience of the current force,' Kendall continued. 'The need for improved connectivity and some degree of enhanced self-protection measure[s] appears to be attractive from both an affordability and cost-effectiveness perspective. It is also something that can be accomplished in relatively short time frames at relatively low cost.' The Air Force, as well as the U.S. Navy, has been eying new defensive and situational awareness upgrades for tankers and other larger support aircraft for years now. Fielding dedicated loyal wingman-like drones to help protect those platforms is also being actively explored. A variety of other modernization efforts for the non-stealthy KC-135 and KC-46 tankers in the Air Force's inventory are also on the table, including a potential pathway to turning them into optionally crewed aircraft. Those aircraft could also see their roles and missions expanding, including through the addition of the ability to act as motherships for swarms of drones.

From front to back, a KC-135, a KC-46, and a KC-10. USAF There is also the matter of next-generation airlift capabilities, which Kendall stressed the importance of in his ATA keynote address. However, plans for a future Next Generation Airlift (NGAL) system of systems are even further away on the horizon than NGAS and face the same affordability challenges. The Air Force has been warning about the impacts of at best largely flat defense budgets in the coming years, too. The service has other priorities it needs to pay for, as well. Most prominent among those demands at present is the new LGM-35A Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile and its associated infrastructure work, the costs of which have skyrocketed. Air Force officials have repeatedly said that they remain committed to the NGAD initiative broadly, as well as to finding ways to dominate the air superiority space going forward no matter what the specific combination of future platforms might look like in the end. That being said, concerns have been steadily growing about the shrinking size of the service's tactical jet fleets now. Kendall himself has said that the Air Force's current budgetary situation has been more and more apparent for some time now, raising additional questions about why the service is only wrapping up the review of its modernization plans now. Overall, the prospect that one or more top-tier modernization programs, such as the NGAD combat jet, might end up seriously truncated or even canceled seems to be steadily growing. The current NGAD platform discussions, specifically, in many ways evoke the memory of what happened to plans for the F-22 Raptor in the late 2000s. At least one retired Air Force official has since said that the service sacrificed its dream of a larger Raptor fleet in order to save what evolved into the B-21. *tens (typo, argh!!)&mdash; Gareth Jennings (@GarethJennings3) November 5, 2024 Whatever happens to the NGAD combat jet program in the coming months, it is clear that the impacts will be much wider spread across the Air Force's modernization priorities. Serious questions have now emerged about what it will take for the service to be able to afford any next-generation aircraft fleets, including future tranches of CCA drones and stealth tankers.

Navy Posts Its First AIM-174 Missile-Armed F/A-18F Super Hornet ‘...	The U.S. Navy has now released its first official images of one of its F/A-18F Super Hornets with a very heavy air-to-air missile loadout that includes four of its new AIM-174Bs. We now know for sure that the jet from Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Nine (VX-9), the 'Vampires,' with its distinctive gloss-black retro-scheme, was taking part in a new iteration of the Gray Flag test and evaluation exercise. The War Zone posited this was likely the case when the first images of the AIM-174B-armed aircraft first emerged back in September. The pictures from Gray Flag 2024 also show the F/A-18F flying together with a Navy F-35C Joint Strike Fighter, also assigned to VX-9, as well as a U.S. Air Force F-15E Strike Eagle. Marine Corps and Army personnel, as well as representatives from unspecified allies and partners, also took part in the exercise. Naval Test Wing Pacific and VX-9 hosted the event from their main base at Point Mugu in California. A U.S. Navy F/A-18F and F-35, both assigned to Air Test and Evaluation Squadron (VX) 9, fly over the Point Mugu Sea Range in Southern California with a U.S. Air Force F-15 during Gray Flag 2024 on Sept. 24, 2024. (U.S. Navy photo by Lt. Cmdr. Kory Hughs) (U.S. Navy photo by Lt. Cmdr. Kory Hughs) (U.S. Navy photo by Lt. Cmdr. Kory Hughs) In addition to the AIM-174s, the VX-9 F/A-18F's Gray Flag loadout included a trio of medium-range AIM-120 AMRAAMs and a pair of short-range AIM-9X Sidewinders. The aircraft also had an infrared search and track system (IRST) in a modified drop tank on its centerline, as well as an ATFLIR targeting pod on its left cheek station. This very heavy air-to-air loadout would be an unlikely one, at least in most situations, for shipboard operations due to restrictions on the jet's weight when returning to the ship, but could possibly prove very useful for land-based missions. The first image of the F/A-18F Super Hornet with four AIM-174 missiles emerged in September. (point_mugu_skies) 'Gray Flag 2024 was an opportunity to bring together a diverse group of participants from different branches of the military, academic partners, science and technology leaders, and allied partners,' Navy Capt. David Halpern, head of Naval Test Wing Pacific, said in a statement. 'The broad scope of participants allowed us to test and evaluate our systems and how they interact with one another in an operationally relevant environment.' The inclusion of the AIM-174 in Gray Flag 2024 is notable, but not at all surprising. These exercises regularly feature new and improved munitions and other capabilities, including ones still in development or of an experimental nature. The AIM-174B first truly broke cover in July at the biennial Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise, at which point the Navy also disclosed that it was in at least limited operational service. The War Zone had already been closely tracking signs pointing to the existence of the weapon, an air-launched version of the highly capable surface-launched multi-purpose SM-6 missile. The War Zone has previously explored in detail how the AIM-174B is set to be central in the Navy's future air combat planning, especially around potential high-end conflict with China in the Pacific. The missile offers important new ways to leverage emerging kill webs and challenge ever-evolving enemy ones, as you can read more about here and check out our video feature on it below. With this in mind, it is interesting to note that Gray Flag 2024 'was the most expansive interoperability event to date, with the data captured informing requirements, tactics, techniques, and procedures for future kill chains,' according to Naval Test Wing Pacific's Capt. Halpern. The AIM-174 looks set to continue being an extremely important feature in future exercises and operational deployments.

China’s J-35A Stealth Fighter Officially Breaks Cover	China has publicly unveiled the Shenyang J-35A, a land-based stealth fighter that has been under development for some time but which had previously only been seen in unofficial and frequently poor-quality imagery. While we now have a good look at the aircraft, many questions remain, especially about the People’s Liberation Army Air Force’s (PLAAF) plans for it, since the base design was previously understood to be under development primarily for export and latterly also for carrier-based service with the PLA Navy. The first official photo of the J-35A was released today, ahead of its planned debut at the China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition, better known as Airshow China, held at Zhuhai Airport in Guangdong province, in southern China. The show opens on November 12. The front three-quarter view of the jet, seen taxiing, reveals several new details and sheds more light on features that were previously more hidden. It also provides a very useful comparison with earlier versions of the J-35 and FC-31, as well as with rival fifth-generation fighters. Also will have export variant J35E/J31 as I have said countless times Here compared with FC31 demonstrator pic.twitter.com/kPAnJBRcZk&mdash; Húrin (@Hurin92) November 5, 2024 Much has been made of the similarities between the J-35/FC-31 and the U.S.-made F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, fueling claims that China copied its American counterpart or at least that it made use of stolen data to directly inform the aircraft's development. While there is no doubt that China has obtained classified data on a range of sensitive Western military programs, and the F-35 program in particular, it doesn't mean the jet was 'copied.' In fact, China cannot copy the F-35, it is one of the world's most complex machines. It can emulate its overall design and knock-off components and certain technologies that it can reproduce and has the data to do so, but the idea that it is a direct copy is blatantly false and a common trope when it comes to comparing foreign military hardware with U.S. designs. Critical outright differences exist, including its twin-engine powerplant compared to the F-35's large single turbofan engine. While the F-35 was designed from the start to accommodate a short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) version, this requirement is absent from the Chinese design. There are clearly many elements that were at least heavily inspired if not cribbed from the F-35, including its DSI inlets, canopy, and basic configuration. Even the name isn't trying to hide that reality. But overall, despite key similarities, the Chinese design is sleeker and more slender looking than the F-35. This is largely in part thanks to not having a STOVL requirement, but it also raises questions about its internal fuel capacity and its range, as well as the available volume for internal stores. Above all else, just because a fighter looks similar doesn't mean it performs anywhere near the same. This is especially true when it comes to what lays on and under the aircraft's skin — specially in terms of avionics and data fusion, sensor technology, and low observable (stealth) structures and coatings. The engines technology is also a major factor. Maybe the best comparison to the J-35A pic.twitter.com/RVS2okIunk&mdash; @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) November 5, 2024 Evolution pic.twitter.com/IfHqip7t0Q&mdash; Húrin (@Hurin92) November 5, 2024 Notable details that we can see in the new photo include an electro-optical targeting system, apparently equivalent to the EOTS found on the F-35, and similarly mounted under the nose, as well as a wide-angle head-up display in the cockpit. There is also what appears to be a radar-reflective Luneburg lens below the fuselage, designed to remove the stealthy jet’s radar-evading qualities when desired. The PLA has also now confirmed the J-35A designation for the land-based version of the fighter, with the carrier-based version being the J-35, and the initial prototypes having the export-centric FC-31 name. Based on that last designation, a land-based version of the jet for the PLAAF had been tentatively — and apparently unofficially — referred to as the J-31. Ever since the first two FC-31 prototypes appeared in land-based form, there had been speculation that as well as for export, a version might also be in the works for the PLAAF, likely as a lighter and more cost-effective complement to the Chengdu J-20. The first FC-31 prototype taxis after a flight at Airshow China 2014 in Zhuhai, on November 11, 2014. JOHANNES EISELE/AFP via Getty Images The first of the FC-31 prototypes took to the air in October 2012. Like the J-35A, the FC-31 also made its public debut at Airshow China, appearing at Zhuhai in 2014. Then followed, in 2016, a thoroughly reworked and greatly refined version of the FC-31, which we discussed in detail at the time. Two photos of the refined second FC-31 prototype. Chinese Internet Work on the land-based FC-31/J-31 was then seemingly scaled back, suggesting a lack of official interest and, before long, the design was significantly reworked for carrier operations, as the J-35. A mockup of the FC-31 stealth fighter is showcased at Airshow China 2022 on November 6, 2022, in Zhuhai, China. Photo by VCG/VCG via Getty Images It was only toward the end of last year that a land-based version of the fighter for domestic use came back into the frame, while progressively clearer photos of one of the prototypes appeared to reveal key features different from those found on the carrier-based J-35. It seems this prototype flew on or around September 26, 2023. Compared to the naval version, the prototype seen in unofficial imagery toward the end of last year appeared to have a smaller overall wing surface area, a characteristic that is also found on the land-based F-35A, in contrast with the bigger wing of the carrier-based F-35C. A comparison of the wing platforms of the first two prototype land-based FC-31 prototypes, a naval J-35 prototype, and what appears to be the land-based J-35A. via Andreas Rupprecht That prototype also appeared to have different landing gear, with a single nose wheel, not the twin wheels found on the naval jet. This feature can now be seen in much better detail in the photo of the J-35A released today. At the same time, the catapult launch bar is also deleted. While there had been a previous announcement of official Pakistani plans to acquire a land-based version of the jet, today’s publication of a photo of the J-35A also brought confirmation that the PLAAF is interested in getting its own examples, a significant development in itself.

PAF Facebook page What we don’t yet know is how far advanced the PLAAF’s plans for the J-35A might be, but the aircraft as publicly revealed wears Air Force insignia on the nose, a service-style overall gray color scheme, and is emblazoned with markings on the tailfins that commemorate the service’s 75th anniversary. Compared to the naval J-35, the tailfins are also of a different design on the J-35A, as well as being larger. Just translated: The J-35 officially announced that the hanging tail 75 is painted to celebrate the birthday of the Air Force! @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) November 4, 2024 A first interesting difference between the new J-35A and the J-35 naval version is the different rudder size & configuration on the Air Force version. pic.twitter.com/LBPegP7LPX&mdash; @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) November 4, 2024 Otherwise, it’s not clear whether the J-35A is a new prototype, one that has been seen before, or perhaps an earlier test aircraft that has been reworked according to PLAAF specifications. Of course, it may also be the same aircraft sighted in the latter half of last year. As for the PLA Navy’s J-35, this is very clearly intended to equip its fast-growing aircraft carrier fleet. While optimized for the latest carrier Fujian with its electromagnetic catapult launch system, there are growing signs that the J-35 will also go to sea in some capacity aboard the earlier carriers Liaoning and Shenyang, which have ‘ski-jump’ takeoff ramps. J-35 (right) and J-15 (left) carrier fighter mockups on the aircraft carrier Liaoning. Chinese Internet Chinese internet via X Turning to the PLAAF, this has so far focused on introducing the J-20, but, as we have explored in the past, complementing this ‘heavy’ stealth fighter with the smaller J-35A could make a good deal of sense. J20 vs J35 pic.twitter.com/Gvy7uhCmYy&mdash; 彩云香江 (@louischeung_hk) November 5, 2024 The service’s recent modernization has been spearheaded by the J-20 alongside the Flanker-derived Shenyang J-16 multirole fighter, as well as the lighter, homegrown Chengdu J-10. With the J-10 very likely approaching the end of its development potential and with the first of these aircraft already getting long in the tooth, the J-35A could be a very suitable replacement for the medium-weight segment of the PLAAF’s fighter force. A PLAAF J-10C fighter. PLAAF Chinese Military The J-35A is also going to be cheaper than the J-20 to procure and operate, meaning it can be fielded in greater numbers to enhance ‘combat mass’ in a way that would simply not be affordable with the bigger Chengdu stealth fighter. There is also an industrial incentive to procure the J-35A for the PLAAF, since it will keep Shenyang engaged in building fighters and will also likely help attract export orders. After all, the South Korean KF-21 Boramae and Turkish TF Kaan programs indicate that there is a market for a medium-weight fighter with low-observable characteristics. The Chinese design also has the major advantage of being immune to the tight export restrictions that typically apply to Western designs in the same class, with Beijing likely to grant export licenses to countries that might be prohibited from buying a South Korean or even a Turkish design, especially since both use U.S.-licensed engines. This export potential has long been the central focus of the meandering FC-31/J-35 program and it could greatly help break China farther out into higher-end fighter marketplace — especially if it is offered at an attractive price. If Pakistan does indeed order the jet it would also offset further development costs and lower production costs. If the PLAAF joins it in large numbers, the price could fall even farther. For now, there are many more questions about the J-35A and some of these might still be answered at Airshow China once it opens next week. In the meantime, the official unveiling of the J-35A, and confirmation of PLAAF interest, a little over a year since it was first spotted, once again demonstrates the pace of development in China’s military aerospace industries.

Suspected Russian Airplane Sabotage Plot Sparks Call For NATO Act...	An advisor to Lithuania’s president is demanding NATO action after claims emerged that the country was the nexus of a Russian sabotage plot to attack U.S. and Canada-bound aircraft by shipping camouflaged incendiary devices on them. This marks the latest in a series of allegations regarding Russian sabotage plots in Europe. 'The Presidency confirms that Russian military intelligence is behind the transport of incendiary packages,' Lithuanian presidential adviser Kęstutis Budrys told the Lithuanian Ziniu radio station on Tuesday. 'We are telling our allies that it's not random, it's part of military operations. This requires a NATO response.' Budrys was referring to a recently divulged Russian plot that originated in Lithuania over the summer, according to Reuters. The scheme, in which German officials say a plane crash was narrowly avoided, is believed to be part of an effort to bring the war home to Ukraine's Western allies. (Reuters) - Russia is behind explosive parcels sent from Lithuania to European countries, a Lithuanian presidential adviser said on Tuesday, amid alarm amongst NATO countries that sabotage organised by Moscow nearly caused an air disaster.Western governments and intelligence…&mdash; Phil Stewart (@phildstewart) November 5, 2024 'Explosive parcels…caused fires in courier depots in Britain, Germany and Poland in July,' the Polish Gazeta Wyborcza daily newspaper reported last month, Reuters noted on Tuesday. Officials say disaster was narrowly avoided when one of the packages ignited in a courier depot in Germany before it could be placed on a plane. Western security officials say 'they believe that two incendiary devices, shipped via DHL, were part of a covert Russian operation that ultimately aimed to start fires aboard cargo or passenger aircraft flying to the U.S. and Canada, as Moscows steps up a sabotage campaign against Washington and its allies,' according to The Wall Street Journal, which broke the story Monday. European security officials 'have linked suspected Russian operatives to a plot to smuggle incendiary devices onto a cargo plane in Germany, in what investigators believe may have been a trial run for future attacks targeting North America-bound aircraft,' The Washington Post reported on Tuesday. An international probe 'that began after one of the devices caught fire prematurely in July determined that the plotters also sent packages without the flammable contents to U.S. and Canadian addresses, in an apparent test to see if the parcels could be successfully delivered,' the publication reported, citing European security officials. Polish authorities say 'four people were charged in connection with camouflaged explosives that ‘detonated during land and air transport’ in the U.K. in July, according to ABC News, citing a statement from the country's prosecutor's office. 'The group's activities consisted of sabotage and diversion related to sending parcels containing camouflaged explosives and dangerous materials via courier companies to European Union countries and Great Britain, which spontaneously ignited or detonated during land and air transport,' the Polish prosecutor's office said in a statement. 'The group's goal was also to test the transfer channel for such parcels, which were ultimately to be sent to the United States of America and Canada.' Western officials 'believe the fires originated in electric massage machines containing a ‘magnesium-based' substance,’' the BBC reported. Russia suspected of targeting logistics infrastructure including airplanes bound for the U.S.,Canada, Britain, EU. with incendiary devices hidden in massagers.Here’s CCTV footage of the device and how it started a fire within seconds in Birmingham pic.twitter.com/NqYn8t9sY6&mdash; Bojan Pancevski (@bopanc) November 5, 2024 As the Post proffered, this scheme is being seen 'as a provocative and particularly dangerous escalation in an alleged sabotage campaign directed by Moscow against NATO countries helping Ukraine defend itself against a Russian military invasion.' Who ordered it remains unclear. Three European security officials told the newspaper that it is unknown whether this was directed by the top of the Kremlin or by lower-level intelligence officials. Overall, there many questions that still need to be answered about this bizarre plot and its perpetrators. Top among them is why would Russia take such a risk? What is the ultimate objective? How does potentially killing large numbers of people in the air or on the ground advance Moscow's ambitions while still avoiding a direct conflict? Above all else, what is the evidence that this actually came from the Russian government? Having parcels exploding on civilian aircraft carrying cargo could have major repercussions during a time of war, where those logistical capabilities would be critical and disruptions would have major battlefield impacts, but such timing doesn't seem to fit with the operations observed. Whatever the case may be, government and civilian officials are paying attention. 'We are aware of two recent incidents involving shipments in our network,' a DHL official said in a statement. 'We are fully cooperating with the relevant authorities to protect our people, our network and our customers’ shipments.' 'The U.S. continues to be vigilant against threats to the aviation and air cargo systems,' a U.S. official told The War Zone, citing the 2025 Homeland Threat Assessment. 'We work closely with industry to take steps to protect against any potential threats whenever they emerge. At this time, there is no current active threat targeting U.S.-bound flights.' 'We continually adjust our security posture as appropriate and promptly share any and all relevant information with our industry partners, to include requirements and recommendations that help them reduce risk,' a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) official said in a statement. 'Over the past several months, as part of a multi-layered security approach, TSA worked with industry partners to put additional security measures for U.S. aircraft operators and foreign air carriers regarding certain cargo shipments bound for the United States, in line with the 2021 TSA Air Cargo Security Roadmap. We greatly appreciate the cooperation and collaboration with industry as together we work to ensure the safety and security of air cargo.' TSA Canadian officials say they are aware of the plot and are concerned about its implications. 'The Government of Canada is aware of and deeply concerned with Russia’s intensifying campaign, from cyber incidents and disinformation operations to sabotage activities,' Zarah Malik, a spokesperson for Public Safety Canada said in a statement to The War Zone. 'Canada has expressed this concern directly to Russian officials and unequivocally stated that any threat to the safety and security of Canadians is unacceptable.' 'While there is no imminent threat to Canadians at this time, Canadian national security and law enforcement agencies are working in close cooperation with our allies on this serious matter to keep Canadians safe,' Malid added. 'The Government of Canada will continue to monitor the situation very closely and will take whatever action is necessary to protect Canadians.' Russia denies being behind acts of sabotage, according to the BBC. 'But it is suspected to have been behind other attacks on warehouses and railway networks in EU member states this year, including in Sweden and in the Czech Republic,' the network noted. There have been other suspicious incidents of sabotage in Europe. As we reported in August, Norway revealed that one of its most strategic air bases was the target of sabotage. That announcement came as other European NATO air bases — namely in Germany — reported incidents - one of which remains unexplained. A critical communications cable associated with Evenes Air Station in northern Norway, home of F-35A fighters, was reportedly cut in an act of sabotage. (Norwegian Air Force) There were also reports about troubling drone activity over critical infrastructure. These incidents came amid increasing warnings about nefarious Russian activity on the continent, part of an apparent wave of ‘hybrid warfare’ as the conflict in Ukraine further stokes East-West tensions. While there is no evidence at the moment that Russia is behind the incidents in Norway and Germany, this all came as NATO has increasingly warned of the risk of an expanding campaign of sabotage, including cyberattacks, across Europe, in a new wave of hybrid warfare masterminded by Russia. In the last few months, there has been a spike in reported incidents of this kind, suspected to be connected to Russia, if not orchestrated directly by Moscow. As well as Germany and Norway, these incidents have been reported in other NATO countries including the Czech Republic, Poland, and the United Kingdom. In July, intelligence officials expressed concern about possible sabotage attacks by Russian-backed actors so acute it saw U.S. military bases across Europe placed on a heightened state of alert, 'for the first time in a decade,' according to CNN. Beyond the question of what Russia's goals would have been for such a flagrantly escalatory operation is if NATO will respond to this provocation and how. This clearly depends on what evidence actually exists that the Russian government was involved and to what degree. Considering its own sensitivities to escalation, it is possible that the alliance could take a wait-and-see approach. Though this plot seems to have been disrupted before anyone was hurt, such actions in the future could prove devastating and they could be used to cripple logistics at a time when they are needed most.

Full Retirement Of Ticonderoga Cruisers On Hold, Trio To Remain I...	The U.S. Navy has partially reversed course on its controversial plans to decommission the last of its Ticonderoga class cruisers by 2027, with three of the ships now set to continue serving further out toward the end of the decade. The new decision regarding the Ticonderogas is part of an ambitious Navy-wide strategy that includes a call to substantially increase the readiness of warships and other key assets within the next three years. This also follows the announcement last week that 12 of the oldest Arleigh Burke class destroyers will see their service lives extended. The Navy announced the life-extension plans for the USS Gettysburg, USS Chosin, and USS Cape St. George, yesterday. There are six more Ticonderoga class cruisers in service now that are still slated for decommissioning in the next two years. The Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Gettysburg. USN The new 'decision adds 10 years of cumulative ship service life from fiscal year 2026 to 2029,' according to a Navy release. 'All three cruisers received extensive hull, mechanical and engineering, as well as combat system upgrades as part of an extended modernization program.' It is worth noting that USS Cape St. George, which is also the youngest still-serving Ticonderoga (commissioned in 1993), is actually still going through this upgrade process and is expected to return to the fleet sometime in the current fiscal year, which started on October 1. The modernization program includes improvements to the ship's Aegis Combat System, a new AN/SPQ-9B radar and upgrades to the existing AN/SPY-1B, an updated SQQ-89A(V)15 sonar suite, modifications to the Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) arrays to expand their capabilities, and a host of other work, according to Navy budget documents. The USS Cape St. George, another one of the three Ticonderogas that are seeing their service lives extended. USN The Navy's original plan was to put 11 of its Ticonderogas through this upgrade program, with the modernized ships then serving into the 2030s. However, growing costs and delays, coupled with worsening cracking and other structural issues, had led it to reassess those plans. In 2022, the service announced its intention to decommission all of the remaining cruisers – including ones right in the middle of being upgraded like Gettysburg and Chosin – by 2027. Two other modernized Ticonderogas, the USS Vicksburg and USS Cowpens, were decommissioned earlier this year. The entire modernization program has already cost the Navy billions of dollars. As already noted, the Navy's original decision to send the Ticonderogas into mothballs was highly controversial. Beyond the sunk cost of the upgrade work, there continue to be serious questions about capability and capacity gaps, which the service has downplayed for years. Each Ticonderoga has 122 Mk 41 VLS cells. For comparison, Flight I and II Arleigh Burke destroyers have 90 Mk 41 cells, while more recent Flight IIA and III ships in that class have 96. The planned decommissioning of the Navy's four highly in-demand Ohio class guided missile submarines, which can loaded with up to 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles apiece, before the end of the decade has only compounded concerns about dwindling missile launch capacity service-wide. It's interesting to point out here that USS Chosin was chosen to be the ship at the center of a test last month of the Transferrable Reload At-sea Method (TRAM) system for restocking Mk 41 VLS cells on ships at sea, which you can read more about here. Whether or not TRAM enters widespread service, at-sea reloading capabilities have emerged as a critical need for the Navy, especially in the context of planning for a potential future high-end fight, such as one in the Pacific against China. An empty missile canister is transferred to USS Chosin as part of a test of the Transferrable Reload At-sea Method (TRAM) system in October 2024. USN Eric Osborne The Ticonderogas were also designed from the outset as air and defense command and control platforms. The ships feature substantial capabilities in that regard that notably leads them to continue to be central components of Navy carrier strike groups. The service's stated plan is for new Flight III Arleigh Burkes, of which it currently has one, to take over this role. Questions have been raised in the past about the long-term viability of this 'maxed out' subclass of Burkes serving in this capacity. The Navy is working toward a true successor to the Arleigh Burke, currently referred to as DDG(X), but the first of those new warships is not expected to enter service until 2032 at the earliest. Previous plans for a direct replacement for the Ticonderogas evolved into the Zumwalt class of stealth destroyers, of which the Navy ultimately acquired just three. There continues to be ambiguity around the expected roles and missions of the Zumwalt class ships, as well as their overall future. A graphic from 2022 depicting a notional DDG(X) design and its features. USN 'As a former cruiser Sailor, I know the incredible value these highly-capable warships bring to the fleet and I am proud of their many decades of service,' Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro said in a statement about the life-extension plans for the Ticonderogas. 'After learning hard lessons from the cruiser modernization program, we are only extending ships that have completed modernization and have the material readiness needed to continue advancing our Navy's mission.' The Navy is facing larger hurdles when it comes to increasing its overall fleet size, as well as maintaining the warships and submarines it has now. Its new Constellation class frigates are also mired in delays, cost growth, and other issues, as you can read more about here. With all this in mind, just last week, the service also announced it would be extending the service lives of a dozen more Flight I Arleigh Burkes into the 2030s to help maintain overall operational capacity. Earlier this year, Adm. Lisa Franchetti, Chief of Naval Operations, unveiled a new service-wide 'navigation plan,' also known as Project 33, which included a prominent goal to be able to surge deploy 80 percent of all naval vessels and combat aircraft, if required, by 2027. 'We are shooting for very high, very tough stretch goals here, and I know that, but the only way we’re going to get there [is] if you set those goals that high,' Franchetti said in September. The new change in plans for the Ticonderoga class is significant. At the same time, the fact that just three of these still highly capable cruisers are getting a relatively short reprieve, and at a high cost, underscores the significant challenges the Navy still faces in meeting its very ambitious readiness and operational capacity goals.

We Finally Get A Clear Look At The Su-57 Felon’s Side Weapons Bay...	The arrival of two Su-57 Felon prototypes for the upcoming Airshow China has provided a good look at many details on Russia's most advanced fighter, although the most interesting has been a first close-up view of its small wing-root weapons bays. At TWZ we have previously examined this feature as well as the air-to-air missiles that are understood to be accommodated in the bays. While long known about, the weapons bays' details had remained something of a mystery and it remains unclear exactly how they function. The photo of the Su-57 showing the starboard-side wing-root weapons bay can be seen in the tweet embedded below, together with a close-up of the same image: First ever clear photo of Su-57's mysterious side weapon bayphoto by 万全@wanquanphoto pic.twitter.com/L1nNy8U2Rm&mdash; Fighterman_FFRC (@Fighterman_FFRC) November 5, 2024 The first Su-57 for Airshow China arrived at Zhuhai Jinwan Airport in South Central China’s Guangdong province on November 3, flying from Russia with a fuel stop at Taiyuan Wusu International Airport in northern China. This aircraft is the fourth prototype, or T-50-4, coded ‘054 Blue.’ The second Felon for the exhibition — the seventh prototype, T-50-7, ‘057 Blue’ — arrived at Zhuhai in a disassembled state aboard an An-124 cargo aircraft and it will be used as a static exhibit only. The Felon is making its debut at Zhuhai, its first foreign airshow appearance.

It should be recalled that this is an early prototype aircraft, with a lower standard of finish than production examples and, moreover, that the Su-57 is not designed to have anywhere near the same degree of stealth as Western fifth-generation fighters. Indeed, its overall design philosophy — which is highly influenced by Russia's low observable design and material science limitations — is very different, as we have discussed at length in the past. A pre-production Su-57. The triangular, canoe-like wing-root weapons bays are visible outboard of the aircraft’s engine intakes. Vitaly Kuzmin Returning to the wing-root weapons bays, one of these was seen during the reassembly of the T-50-7 at Zhuhai. The bays take the form of triangular-section fairings that are intended for quick launch — the clamshell-like doors popping open for a missile to be released and rapidly closing, to help maintain the jet's radar signature. These bays are in addition to the two large internal weapon bays that are arranged in tandem between the engines and which can carry much larger stores. Back in 2020, the Russian Ministry of Defense published a video showing a short-range missile launch from a pre-production Su-57’s wing-root bay, but no details of the bay itself could be seen. A sequence showing the launch of an air-to-air missile from one of the Su-57’s two small wing-root weapons bays. Russian Ministry of Defense Capture The missile launch clip begins at approximately 1:19 in the runtime of the video below: Even with the photo from Zhuhai, it’s still not possible to determine exactly how missiles are launched from these bays, although a trapeze mechanism, broadly similar to the one the U.S. Air Force’s F-22 Raptors use to launch AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles from their cheek bays, likely extend the missile outward at an angle into the Su-57’s slipstream. The missile launch video also appears to support this hypothesis. While the LOAL mode wouldn’t be required if the missile can be extended on a trapeze before launch, it would still be a very useful feature to call upon. An F-22’s side weapons bay with its launch rail carrying an AIM-9X extended. U.S. Air Force There is no evidence that the Su-57 wing-root bay doors can close or partially close with the missile extended, similar to the novel design found on China’s J-20. A J-20 with a pair of PL-10 air-to-air missiles deployed on the outside of the jet’s side weapons bays and with the main under-fuselage weapons bay also open. via Chinese Internet In the Su-57, each of the wing-root bays is understood to carry a single infrared-guided air-to-air missile, namely the K-74M2 (also known as the izdeliye 760) for close-air combat, produced by the Vympel missile design bureau. The K suffix denotes a missile that is still in the development phase, with the production version of the izdeliye 760 being the R-74M2. For now, its exact service status is unclear. In early 2021, the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) think tank suggested that the K-74M2 was 'in the final stages of testing.' As we have discussed before, the K-74M2 is optimized for internal carriage by the Su-57, with reduced dimensions and it also adds a new infrared seeker from the Russian Azov AOMZ company. Other changes over the earlier R-73 and R-74 missiles include a rocket motor with increased burn time, for longer range and a higher end game energy state. Published specifications for the K-74M2 include a maximum range of 31 miles, compared to 25 miles for the R-74, and 18.6 miles for the R-73. Missile range figures are often dubious at best and the K-74M2’s true real-world range will differ based on the flight profile of each engagement and the target's behavior, which can vary considerably. For example, if a lot of maneuvering energy is needed to reach the target, that impressive range figure could be reduced to a handful of miles. Importantly, the K-74M2 can reportedly also be fired in lock-on-after-launch (LOAL) mode, which means the seeker head can remain concealed within the bay during the target acquisition phase. Using LOAL, the missile begins its flight under inertial control, with a datalink allowing the launch aircraft to provide target updates during missile flight, before achieving an in-flight lock-on. It’s also worth noting that, in 2019, images emerged of what appeared to be a new, compact Russian air-to-air missile, derived, at least in part, from Vympel’s medium-range R-77 series. Its overall size and other design elements suggested it could potentially also be intended to fit inside the Su-57’s wing-root bays, although it was not the K-74M2, which was ultimately revealed to be much closer in form to the R-73 and R-74 from which it was derived. A display of missiles at the Vympel design facility. From top to bottom, the missiles are, an unconfirmed new design, an R-74/R-74, and an R-77, as well as a gray launch rail. Anton Novodereshkin/TASS Since then, it was reported that Russia was pressing ahead with an all-new ‘clean-sheet’ short-range missile to supersede the R-73 and R-74 series, the original design of which dates back to the Cold War. This new missile is the izdeliye 300M, also from Vympel, which is likely to be a continuation of an earlier advanced short-range air-to-air missile program, the izdeliye 300, which was canceled in the 1990s in favor of further development of the tried and tested R-73. It’s not clear whether the izdeliye 300M will also be scaled to fit the Su-57’s wing-root weapons bays, but that would seem possible, provided that its development continues. As well as the K-74M2, there are other air-to-air weapons tailored for internal carriage in the Su-57, albeit in its larger under-fuselage weapons bays, including the beyond-visual range R-77M (izdeliye 180) and the very-long-range-range (estimated at 186 miles) izdeliye 810 missiles. These are also based on existing designs, the R-77 (AA-12 Adder) and the R-37M (AA-13 Axehead), respectively. New versions of the R-77 spotted on a four Ship #Su57 ‘Felon’ formation on Russian TV for the first time. The second aircraft carries the newer version of the K-77M (Izdeliye 180) and possibly a ramjet powered K-77ME (Izdeliye 180-BD)?@Firezstarter1 @zone5aviation @hvtiaf pic.twitter.com/izpdFsP4WK&mdash; Sameer Joshi (@joe_sameer) October 5, 2020 While there is still more to learn about the Su-57’s wing-root weapons bays, it’s meanwhile clear that Russia is busy exploring the integration of new weapons on the aircraft. This has very likely also included combat trials of weapons in Ukraine, on a more extensive basis than was the case during the Felon’s very brief operational, or semi-operational deployment to Syria. The appearance of the Su-57 at Airshow China is also notable, with Russia clearly trying to drum up export interest in the fighter, which has so far secured only 76 orders from the Russian Ministry of Defense. Plans to jointly develop a version of the Felon for the Indian Air Force collapsed when India dramatically walked away from the program in 2018. Since then, the Su-57 has been pitched unsuccessfully to Turkey, while Algeria, Egypt, and Vietnam — as traditional buyers of Russian military technology — have all been suggested as possible customers. Securing a foreign customer is very likely a prerequisite for Sukhoi completing the development of the improved Su-57M version, which is planned to be fitted with more powerful engines for enhanced performance. In the meantime, continued weapons testing is helping move the Su-57 closer to a true operational capability. Whatever way they work, it appears the wing-root bays will be a fundamental part of the Felon’s frontline armory, providing a valuable boost to its overall weapons capacity and possibly introducing a capable new short-range air-to-air missile in the process.

Russia Firing Record Number Of Shahed-136s At Ukraine	Russian forces are launching about 10 times as many Shahed-136 drones against Ukraine as they did last fall, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Telegram Monday. Moscow 'has ramped up drone strikes on Kyiv and the rest of the country, while decreasing the use of more powerful and harder-to-intercept cruise and ballistic missiles,' the Kyiv Independent reported. 'We must fully counter them,' Zelensky said following the meeting with top Ukrainian officials. russia is now using about ten times as many 'Shaheds' as last fall, – Zelenskyy said after the Headquarters meeting.Key reports: strengthening air defense in the regions that need it most; development of new solutions in the fight against guided bombs; reinforcement… pic.twitter.com/dvV33Fu9oz&mdash; BLYSKAVKA (@blyskavka_ua) November 4, 2024 On Nov. 3, the Ukrainian Air Force said that Russia 'attacked with one Kh-59/69 guided air missile from the airspace of the Kursk region and 96 Shahed drones. Meanwhile, as they increase their use of Shahed drones, the Russians are 'stockpiling missiles and have begun to use more decoys,' according to Ukrainian military and political analyst Oleksandr Kovalenko. 'In total, over the past month, the enemy used 84 missiles of various types, which is almost two times less than in September (151),' he stated on Telegram. 'At the same time, 15 were intercepted (versus 48 missiles in September).' Last month, 'the Russian occupiers did not carry out massive missile strikes on Ukraine - as, in general, in September,' he noted. 'But there were regular single strikes - with frequent use of Kh-59/69 and 9M723 missiles.' During October, 'not a single launch of the 9M728 Iskander-K OTRK [cruise missile] was recorded, while the enemy regularly used the 9M723 Iskander-M/KN-23 OTRK [ballistic missiles],' Kovalenko added, noting that there was a similar pause in the use of Kh-101/555 air-launched cruise missiles and the Kalibr sea-launched cruise missiles. 'But this does not mean that the Russian occupation forces have run out of them, but indicates their accumulation,' he posited. Russia is very likely saving its missiles for massive attacks on Ukraine's already-imperiled electrical grid during the cold winter months when they will have the most effect on morale. Russia did not attack Ukraine with Kh-101 missiles for 61 days: they are stockpiling until winter, - TrackingDuring this period, they could produce at least 120 missiles of this type; At the 'Olenya/Engels-2' - 15 Tu-95MS. pic.twitter.com/ancoaI0e3F&mdash; MAKS 24 (@Maks_NAFO_FELLA) November 4, 2024 Zelensky pointed out that there are a large amount of foreign components in these drones. 'Such a massive number of Shaheds requires over 170,000 individual components that should have been blocked from reaching Russia,' Zelensky commented. 'They come from companies in China, Europe, and America—lots of small but constant contributions to Russia’s terror.' This ongoing supply chain 'highlights, yet again, the urgent need for the world to step up export controls on special components and resources,' he added. 'Russia must not be allowed to circumvent sanctions that were imposed long ago in response to this war. Sanctions must increase and be effective. Every scheme to bypass sanctions is a crime against people and the world. These very schemes also enable Russia to strengthen regimes in Iran and North Korea. This is a global threat, and only global, unified pressure can overcome it.' Russia is gradually ramping up its daily attacks with Shahed drones and missiles, still using Western components to do so. In October alone, over 2,000 Shaheds were launched against Ukraine—almost every single day. Such a massive number of Shaheds requires over 170,000 individual… pic.twitter.com/sCBt5crgQU&mdash; Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa) November 2, 2024 Last month, Russians used 2,023 'Shahed' drones as well as those 'of an unspecified type' on civilian and military facilities in Ukraine, the Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff claimed on Telegram last week. 'Of them, 1,185 were destroyed/suppressed by Ukrainian defenders and another 29 UAVs left the controlled airspace of our country. In general, since the beginning of 2024, the enemy launched 6,987 attack UAVs on the territory of Ukraine. Mostly enemy drones targeted the civilian and critical infrastructure of Ukraine.' While having 29% of all long-range one-way attack launched at Ukraine this year fired in the past month is a stunning figure, Kovalenko suggested that number also included some decoys. The 'professionalism and skill of the servicemen of the Defense Forces' saved 'thousands of lives of our people from the Russian air terror, to protect hundreds of homes of Ukrainian citizens and important state objects from destruction,' the General Staff explained. I’ve been in #Kyiv for the last week of October - the sleep-robbing Shahed attacks are relentless. While most are shot down, the psychological impact is like living with a malevolently colicky (and occasionally lethal) baby waking you up several times a night - with no cuddles. Roman Waschuk (@WaschukCanUA) November 1, 2024 Overnight into Monday, Russia launched 80 Shaheds, according to Ukrainian Member of Parliament Lesia Vasylenko.

'Starlink can be needed by the enemy in order to transmit intelligence, for example, collected by radio equipment regarding the positions of Ukrainian air defense,' the publication surmised. 'Or, in the case of equipping the drone with cameras - images. And thanks to Starlink, the Russian Federation can use Shahed as an extremely long-range [drone] with the possibility of reconnaissance, due to an additional camera, and defeat even moving targets.' The use of enhanced Shaheds to hunt and kill even moving targets far behind the front lines is something we first discussed back in February. We contacted SpaceX for comment and will update this story with any pertinent response provided. ‘Ukraine Discovers Starlink on Downed Russian Shahed Drone: Report’ Hans de Vreij (@hdevreij) October 28, 2024 As we previously reported, Russia is using densely packed waves of Shaheds to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses. Now one of Russia's new long-range Gerbera drones, likely serving as a decoy during a mass Shahed drone attack, was captured on video being intercepted by a Ukrainian drone. Like the Shahed, the new drone has a relatively large delta wing, although with prominently cranked leading edges. Rather than vertical stabilizers on the wingtips as on the Geran, the Gerbera has a conventional single vertical tailfin, located just ahead of the single pusher propeller driven by an internal combustion engine.

'Counter-intelligence of the Security Service detained an enemy henchman who worked for the military-industrial complex of the Russian Federation in Kharkiv,' SBU claimed. 'He turned out to be a 72-year-old scientist-mechanic who, on the order of the Rashists, developed drawings for the improvement of Shahed-type kamikaze drones. In particular, he worked on the modernization of engines and catapult installations.' According to the investigation, 'the suspect remotely transferred technological developments to his acquaintance, the general director of one of the Russian machine-building plants, which produces units for drones.' Since 2023, that company has 'been closely cooperating with the Russian company, which is engaged in the production of shock drones of the ‘Shahed’ type, which the Russians label under the name ‘Geran-2.’' The suspect 'used e-mail and a popular messenger to communicate with Russian accomplices. At the same time, he disguised cooperation with the occupiers under the guise of preparing scientific papers in the field of UAVs,' SBU avered. 'As the investigation established, the scientist involved in the project worked with his former student, who fled from Kharkiv Oblast to the Russian Federation at the beginning of the full-scale war. There he got a job at the Moscow University of Technology, where he develops drones for the Russian Armed Forces.' During the search, 'computer equipment, a mobile phone and flash drives with evidence of subversive activities in favor of the Russian Federation were seized from him,' according to SBU. The suspect 'is in custody. He faces 12 years in prison with confiscation of property.' Initially, Russia received its Shahed drones from Iran. Last month, Ukraine said it hit a warehouse storing about 400 Shaheds that exploded in the attack, according to Radio Liberty. Earlier this year, we told you about the new factory in Russia producing Shaheds. The increasing waves of these drones used to attack Ukraine may be an indication of that facility's output. What remains unclear is what components are still be sourced through Iran and if Israel's air strikes would hamper the delivery of those subsystems if they are indeed still coming from Iran. The Latest On the battlefield, Russian forces continue to press deeper into Ukrainian defenses. The latest Institute for the Study of War (ISW) assessment offers details about these advances. Kursk Oblast: Russian forces reportedly recently advanced in the main Ukrainian salient in Kursk Oblast amid continued fighting on November 3. Speaking to reporters Monday afternoon, including from The War Zone, the Pentagon's top spokesman Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Russia hasn't made any significant gains in Kursk. Kharkiv Oblast: The Russians continued limited offensive operations northeast of Kharkiv City near Vovchansk and Hatyshche (northwest of Vovchansk) on November 2 and 3 but did not advance. Luhansk Oblast: Moscow’s troops recently advanced west of Svatove and northwest of Kreminna amid continued offensive operations along the Kupyansk-Svatove-Kreminna line on November 3. 'Geolocated footage published on November 3 indicates that Russian forces recently advanced on the eastern outskirts of Andriivka (west of Svatove) and in northern Terny (northwest of Kreminna),' according to ISW. Donetsk: Russian forces recently launched a battalion-sized mechanized assault southeast of Siversk and marginally advanced. 'Geolocated footage published on November 2 shows Ukrainian forces repelling a Russian battalion-sized mechanized assault involving around 120 Russian servicemen, seven tanks, 13 infantry fighting vehicles (BMPs), and two MT-LB amphibious armored personnel carriers northeast of Vesele and south of Ivano-Darivka (both southeast of Siversk),' ISW reported. The geolocated footage 'indicates that Russian forces marginally advanced in the areas northeast of Vesele and south Ivano-Darivka. Russian forces reportedly continued assaults in Chasiv Yar and south of Chasiv Yar near Predtechnyne on November 2 and 3 but did not advance. They also continued offensive operations north of Kurakhove near Novoselydivka, Novodmytrivka, and Kreminna Balka; northeast of Kurakhove near Hostre, Vovchanka, and Illinka; and east of Kurakhove near Maksymilyanivka. Russian forces recently advanced northeast and northwest of Vuhledar amid continued offensive operations on November 2 and 3. 'Geolocated footage published on November 3 also shows that Russian forces seized Katerynivka (northeast of Vuhledar) and advanced towards a bridge east of Yelyzavetivka (northwest of Katerynivka),' ISW explained. Zaporizhzhia Oblast: Russian forces reportedly marginally advanced during localized ground attacks in western Zaporizhia Oblast on November 3.

He provided no details or any visual proof. Ryder on Monday said he could not corroborate that or the veracity of an image showing a North Korean soldier reportedly killed in action in Kursk which you can see below. This photograph shows a North Korean soldier killed fighting Ukrainian troops in Russia's Kursk region. There are about 10,000 North Korean troops currently in Kursk, Ryder said. That's an increase from the 7,200 Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Directorate, told us were there last week. Pyongyang, as we were the first to report, has sent some 12,000 troops to aid Russia’s fight against Ukraine, according to Budanov. In another sign of the burgeoning Moscow-Pyongyang relationship, Russian President Vladimir Putin met with North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui in the Kremlin on Monday, Moscow announced. Choe has been in Russia for a week and has pledged that North Korea would stand by Russia until its 'victory' in Ukraine, according to The Moscow Times. 'President Putin received the foreign minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Choe Son Hui,' the Kremlin said in a statement, publishing a video of the pair shaking hands ahead of talks. That statement comes on the heels of one Choe made last week, saying: 'From the very beginning of the war, our esteemed comrade Kim Jong-un instructed us to consistently and powerfully support and assist the Russian army in their holy war.'

One North Korean soldier surrendered to the Ukrainians.&mdash; InsideNK/GeoPolitics (@inside_nk) October 30, 2024 The presence of so many North Korean troops in Russia has sparked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to call for greater intelligence sharing with South Korea. 'There is only one conclusion,' Zelensky said he told South Korean President Yun Seok-yeol on Sunday. 'This war is internationalized and goes beyond the borders of two states.' In addition, the two leaders 'agreed to strengthen the exchange of intelligence and expertise, to intensify contacts at all levels, including the highest, in order to develop an action strategy and a list of countermeasures in response to escalation,' Zelensky stated. In addition, he called for both nations 'to involve mutual partners in cooperation. Within the framework of this agreement, Ukraine and the Republic of Korea will soon exchange delegations to coordinate actions.' Last week, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Russian forces 'have trained the North Korean soldiers in artillery operations, unmanned aerial vehicle operations and basic infantry tactics to include trench clearing.' The Kremlin, he added, 'has also provided these [North Korean] troops with Russian uniforms and equipment, and all of that strongly indicates that Russia intends to use these foreign forces in frontline operations in its war of choice against Ukraine.' 'Make no mistake,' Austin posited. 'If these North Korean troops engage in combat or combat support operations against Ukraine, they would make themselves legitimate military targets,' the secretary said. Just days after complaining that Ukraine has received only 10% of the military aid promised by allies, President Volodymyr Zelensky offered some positive news on that front. 'There are important developments in the matter of supply from partners for the front - we are recording an increase in supply according to support packages,' Zelensky said Monday on Telegram. 'The results in the supply of artillery became better.' Volodymyr Zelenskyy reported on important developments in the matter of supplies from partners for the front.

CIA Has Secret 'Nonviolent' Way To Disable Large Ships: Report	The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency reportedly has at least one mysterious system capable of 'covertly (and nonviolently)' disabling ships, including very large ones. The secret system is said to have been considered for use against fuel tankers sailing between Venezuela and Cuba during President Donald Trump's term in office. A mention of the CIA ship-disabling system is included in a detailed exposé about the Trump administration's unsuccessful efforts to overthrow dictatorial Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro that Wired published on October 31 and is worth reading in full. The report describes a host of efforts that the U.S. government and foreign partners undertook to try to unseat Maduro between 2018 and 2020. This includes a cyber attack on the payroll system for Venzeuzla's armed forces, sabotage raids by Colombian operatives targeting the Venezuelan Air Force's Russian-made Sukhoi Su-30 fighters, and support for opposition leader Juan Guaido's attempt to overthrow Maduro's government. President Donald Trump, at left, and Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, at right, at the White House on February 5, 2020. Mark Wilson/Getty Images 'Cuba relies on oil from Venezuela. In return, US officials believe, the Cuban security services have helped protect Maduro, essentially serving as an on-the-ground praetorian guard for the embattled socialist autocrat,' per Wired's report. 'The Trump administration thought if the US could somehow intercept or sabotage the oil ships sailing from Venezuela to Cuba, it could strike a blow against both regimes.' 'At least one option involved the CIA, which had a mobile system that could covertly (and nonviolently) disable ships. Trump administration officials wanted the agency to move the system near Venezuela, to hit some of its fuel tankers,' the story continues. 'The agency balked. CIA officials explained that it only had one of these systems, that it was currently in another hemisphere, and they didn’t want to move it to the northern end of South America. The idea was shelved.' An oil tanker and other ships are seen off the coast of Venezuela in January 2024. GUSTAVO GRANADO/AFP via Getty Images No specific details about the CIA's ship-stopping system, including its 'nonviolent' method of function, are provided in Wired's piece, but there are some clear possibilities. What comes to mind first is the possibility that the system in question creates the intended effects by pumping out bursts of high-power microwave (HPM) energy. This could allow for the destruction, disabling, or disruption of key systems, such as radars, computerized navigation gear, communications suites, steering systems, and electronic engine control systems, in turn stopping a vessel, but also leaving its crew unharmed. 'HPM weapons create invisible beams of electromagnetic energy within a specific spectrum of radio and microwave frequencies that can cause a range of temporary or permanent effects on electronic targets. Examples include non-kinetic disabling of computer systems, damaging targeted electronics, disrupting security and industrial control systems, etc,' a 2023 press release related to a U.S. Air Force/U.S. Navy program called High-power Joint Electromagnetic Non-Kinetic Strike (HiJENKS) explains. 'Electromagnetic energy from an HPM weapon can couple to an electronic target directly through a transmit or receive element (like an antenna), or indirectly, through an aperture or cable points of entry (e.g., cracks, seams, external wires). Currents and voltages can be induced in target circuitry, resulting in erroneous signals, system lock-up, system failure, and/or physical damage.' Publicly available details about HiJENKS remain limited, but this capability was successfully demonstrated at least once during a live-fire test event at the Navy's sprawling China Lake test center in 2022. HiJENKS also follows on from the similarly secretive Counter-Electronics High-Power Advanced Microwave Project (CHAMP) missile containing an HPM generator payload, which Boeing is understood to have delivered at least a small number of to the Air Force. The U.S. military is also known to have at least funded work in the past on lower-tier HPM systems designed to stop smaller watercraft, as well as vehicles, including ones rigged up as suicide bombs, on land. A 2016 briefing slide discussing HPM 'vehicle and vessel stopper' work at that time and plans for future developments. USN via FOIA An HPM-based system could require getting the source relatively close to the target, which might also be difficult to do covertly. Employing uncrewed aerial or maritime platforms, or disguised 'civilian' ones, configured to launch an 'attack' of this kind would potentially offer ways to reduce the chance of detection and/or attribution. A nuclear submarine-based capability is also possible. The CIA's ship-stopping system might also be capable of launching some other kind of highly-targeted electronic or cyber warfare attack to produce broadly similar effects. An electronic attack that blinds key sensors and communications could stop or slow a vessel. A cyber attack could disable key industrial control systems on a ship, bringing it to a halt, but it would require a vector to breach those systems externally from the vessel. All of this evokes the memory of still unsubstantiated reports of the U.S. government's use of less-than-lethal 'stun bombs' in Libya in 2011 and 'electricity bombs' in Syria in 2017. The War Zone previously explored the potential legitimacy of those claims, including as evidence of novel directed energy and/or electronic/cyber warfare attacks, as well as other possibilities, in detail. 6/ When plane wants to drop electricity bomb, we are told to drop anything metal that we carry. Otherwise we also burn like ISIS fighters.&mdash; Jenan Moussa (@jenanmoussa) July 7, 2017 Some kind of physical mode of attack, such as one that causes an obstruction to certain features of ship, including elements of its propulsion system and rudders, and that doesn't cause permanent damage, could be another option. Systems designed to slow or stop a vessel by fouling its propellers do exist, as seen in the video below, though they are generally intended for use against smaller watercraft. Prop foulers have been used to disable larger ships, but usually during harassment activities with a ship towing a long chain with floaters on it or other improvised obstruction mechanisms. It's possible an unmanned craft could be adapted for this, but those are very dynamic operations that require a lot of situational awareness to pull off successfully. Innocuous accidents involving ship propellers getting tangled up in a fishing net also do just happen. A system designed to initiate a physical less-than-lethal attack sufficient enough to hamper the movement of a large ship like an oil tanker, and doing so covertly, seems less likely than the aforementioned, less physically invasive options. Getting an obstructing device of some kind successfully in place discreetly, especially in front of or on a vessel in motion, could present significant challenges. It's unknown whether or not the CIA has expanded its inventory of the system that Wired reported on in recent years or has any other similar ones in its toolkit now. The fact that there was just one, at least at the time, points to a somewhat exotic and/or experimental capability. The CIA is certainly well-known at this point for developing or supporting the development of novel means of targeting adversaries, lethally and non-lethally. For instance, the Agency had a hand in the development of the specialized low-collateral damage AGM-114R9X version of the Hellfire missile, which features an array of pop-out knife-like blades rather than a high-explosive warhead. The details from Wired's story that the CIA 'only had one of these systems, that it was currently in another hemisphere, and they didn’t want to move it,' are also very interesting regardless of how the reported ship-stopping capability works. This would seem to point to the system in question being forward deployed outside of the Western Hemisphere already, and possibly with a very specific target set in mind. This might also indicate a reticence to potentially expose what this system can do absent an especially serious crisis or very high priority, clandestine operations. An oil tanker sits just off the coast of Venezuela in 2019. A fisherman is seen in the foreground working with a net. JUAN BARRETO/AFP via Getty Images Regardless of its specific mode of function, it is not at all hard to see how a covert and less-than-lethal ship-stopping capability would be highly attractive. For instance, it could be of great use for visit, board, search, and seizure (VBSS) operations. Stopping a ship, and even possibly cutting off its sensors and power, could make boarding and seizing control over it much easier. In areas where a VBSS or other special operations boarding teams are not present and will take too much time to there, such a system could stall the ship in preferred waters until critical capabilities arrive. Beyond just making a raid easier and safer, this all could be especially useful for responding on very short notice to top-priority actionable intelligence, such as alerts about the smuggling of particularly worrisome cargoes like nuclear material. There are many other applications, as well. When used against military vessels, we are talking about taking the ship offline, or at least stopping it from moving and leaving it more vulnerable without firing a shot. Altogether, while Wired's report provides limited details, the ship-stopping capability described therein would make good sense for the U.S. government to have up its sleeve.

German Navy Confirms Its Supersized Frigate Will Avoid The Red Se...	A German Navy warship is returning from an extensive deployment to the Indo-Pacific region via the Cape of Good Hope, avoiding a potentially hazardous passage through the Red Sea, a German Ministry of Defense spokesperson has confirmed to The War Zone. The frigate Baden-Württemberg, together with the replenishment ship Frankfurt am Main, will take the long route around Africa, due to the dangers in the Red Sea — primarily the ongoing anti-shipping campaign by Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi militants. German Air Force Eurofighter EF2000s fly over the frigate Baden-Württemberg off the coast of Hawaii during the joint exercises Pacific Skies 2024 and Pacific Waves, on July 30, 2024. Bundeswehr/Francis Hildemann Francis Hildemann The German Ministry of Defense spokesperson told The War Zone that German Minister of Defense Boris Pistorius decided last week to reroute the two German Navy vessels that form the Indo-Pacific Deployment Task Group, 'based on a comprehensive assessment of the threat situation in relation to the air defense capabilities of both ships.' 'Due to the fact that Baden-Württemberg is not designed as a major air defender combat vessel, she is not able to provide an air defense umbrella for extended self-defense against air-breathing threats and to efficiently protect the supply vessel which is in company,' the same spokesperson added, before confirming that both ships had recently departed India. #MaritimePartnership #BridgesofFriendship#INSDelhi of the #SunriseFleet, Frigate Baden-Württemberg and Tanker Frankfurt Am Main of the #GermanNavy undertook their maiden #Maritimepartnership Exercise in the Indian Ocean including cross deck flying operations, underway… pic.twitter.com/9ByPKIjj2c&mdash; Eastern Naval Command (@IN_HQENC) October 24, 2024 While the German news magazine Spiegel had reported last week that the vessels would reroute, the source was not revealed and TWZ is, as fas as we know, first to get confirmation direct from the German Ministry of Defense. Taking the much longer route around the Cape of Good Hope will avoid potential attack by Houthi cruise missiles, aerial and maritime drones, and (non-air-breathing) ballistic missiles, but it also paints a concerning picture about the ability of the German Navy — and the allied task forces in the region — to provide adequate defenses. The German Navy does not currently have a unit in the Red Sea that could provide escort for the two ships, a situation that has existed since the F124 Sachsen class frigate Hessen departed the Red Sea for Germany in April, after two months deployed as part of the European Union’s Aspides mission. You can read more about that here. For air defense, the Sachsen class is armed with 32 Mk 41 vertical launch system (VLS) cells that are typically loaded with 24 SM-2 Block IIIA and 32 RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) surface-to-air missiles. There are also two RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) launchers for close-in defense, a single dual-purpose 76mm gun, and a pair of 27mm MLG 27 cannons. The frigate Hessen prepares to pull alongside the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman during a simulated fueling-at-sea, in the Mediterranean Sea in 2018. U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Kaysee Lohmann/Released MC3 Kaysee Lohmann In contrast, the air defense weaponry of the F125 Baden-Württemberg class frigate consists only of two RAM launchers, two 27mm MLG 27 cannons, and several heavy machine guns. Both F124 and F125 frigates can embark up to two Sea Lynx helicopters, which could potentially also be used to intercept drones in the air, something we have already seen happen in the Red Sea campaign.

As we have noted before, these odd destroyer-sized ships are built for 'stabilization, crisis management, conflict prevention, and international intervention operations.' 'What’s critically lacking here is any sort of area air defense capability,' we wrote back in 2017. 'For such a large surface combatant, lacking some sort of air defense capability beyond close-in weapon systems seems outright bizarre, especially considering the ship’s capable sensor suite.' Germany has managed to build a €650 mil, 10.000t frigate that is essentially useless for any but the most benign of operational environments. Anything above a Somali pirate skiff and the F-125 is in trouble. Georg ‘Tenured Maverick’ Löfflmann (@gloefflmann) October 29, 2024 The Type 702 Berlin class replenishment ship, of which Frankfurt am Main is one of two, has an anti-aircraft armament of four 27mm MLG 27 cannons, several heavy machine guns, plus provision for FIM-92 Stinger man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS), which are not known to be regularly carried. The Type 702 Berlin class replenishment ship Frankfurt am Main. Bundeswehr/Schönbrodt With that in mind, it’s certainly true that the two vessels of the Indo-Pacific Deployment Task Group are entirely inadequately protected against cruise missile and drone threats at any distance beyond the roughly 5.6-mile range of the RIM-116 RAM. While this close-in weapon system could potentially deal with these kinds of threats within this engagement range, it would be too risky to wait for the missile or drone to get so close to the ships before having the option to engage. This would be even more hazardous in an attack involving multiple cruise missiles and/or drones. Meanwhile, the two ships are entirely defenseless against ballistic missiles, including the anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBMs) that the Houthis began to use earlier this year. The Barbados-flagged, Liberian-owned bulk carrier M/V True Confidence after being hit by a Houthi anti-ship ballistic missile (ASBM) while transiting the Gulf of Aden, on March 6, 2024. The multinational crew reported three fatalities, at least four injuries, and significant damage to the ship. CENTCOM With no German Navy warship in the Red Sea that would be able to offer an enhanced level of air defense protection, it seems the decision was taken to avoid the area, although that does also raise questions about the availability of other allied warships there to provide the required air defense capabilities. According to the Spiegel, 'other nations operating with warships [in the Red Sea] reported that escort was currently not possible.' Two separate international task forces have been set up to defend Red Sea shipping. The U.S.-led Operation Prosperity Guardian, which The War Zone was the first to write about, was established last December. The European-led Operation Aspides followed two months later. The frigate Baden-Württemberg takes part in an ADEX (Air Defense Exercise) during its latest Indo-Pacific deployment, on May 31, 2024. Philipp Schäfer/Bundeswehr Philipp Schäfer This latest development does, however, suggest that these missions are less resourced overall than they were in the past. A contributing factor may also be the increased focus on Iran, especially for the United States right now. These operations have been broadly a tactical success, but there have also been questions about their long-term viability, also in relation to the prolonged stress that kinetic engagements put on stocks of precious weapons. In the meantime, the Houthi attacks have not stopped and the militants continue to be armed by Iran, while international shipping remains disrupted. While coalition vessels have been credited with shooting down numerous Houthi cruise missiles, drones, and ballistic missiles — using a very wide variety of weapons and non-kinetic systems to do so — there have also been incidents when these warships’ air defenses haven’t worked as well as planned. The Hessen 'repelled four attacks by the Houthi rebels,' according to the German Armed Forces, and also carried out 18 close escort missions, guiding '27 merchant ships with a total tonnage of 1.3 million tons safely through the danger zone.' Accompanied by a Sea Lynx helicopter, the frigate Hessen enters the port of Wilhelmshaven after its mission in the Red Sea, on May 5, 2024. Photo by Lars Penning/picture alliance via Getty Images picture alliance But as well as shooting down two Houthi drones using its 76mm gun and RIM-116 RAM, the frigate also accidentally fired on an American MQ-9 Reaper drone while confused about its identity. More embarrassing was the performance of the Royal Danish Navy, whose frigate Iver Huitfeldt suffered radar and air defense missile system failures during a Houthi drone attack. In particular, it was reported that the warship was unable to fire its RIM-162 ESSM for a half-hour period, while 'up to half' of the rounds fired from the twin 76mm guns detonated too early and close to the ship. Nevertheless, the Iver Huitfeldt was able to shoot down four of the incoming drones, while the remainder were tackled by other vessels. The Danish warship also saw its deployment cut short and contributed to the sacking of the head of the Danish Armed Forces.

Photo by Ida Marie Odgaard / Ritzau Scanpix / AFP / Denmark OUT IDA MARIE ODGAARD These incidents demonstrate the very real challenges of countering the Houthi anti-shipping campaign, something that is also putting considerable demands on available weapons stocks. At the same time, while the losses inflicted on shipping by the Houthis have been limited, their campaign has continued, and it has forced many commercial shipping companies to avoid the Red Sea route. This has knock-on effects on the global supply chain, driving up costs and adding delays. The Houthis have even extended the scope of their campaign, with new tactics and an extended radius over which they can launch their attacks. This only increases the burden on the multinational task forces, which require more warships and munitions to counter the militants’ attacks. The War Zone recently examined reports that the Houthis are also receiving help from Russia in their attacks. After sailing from there toward South Africa and then heading north, the Baden-Württemberg is expected to enter the Mediterranean, to join the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon or UNIFIL peacekeeping mission, while Frankfurt am Main will return to Germany. German Minister of Defense Boris Pistorius on board the German frigate Baden-Württemberg during the U.S.-led military exercise Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise earlier this year. Photo by Soeren Stache/picture alliance via Getty Images picture alliance In the meantime, Germany is continuing to participate in the European-led Operation Aspides mission in the Red Sea, with a contingent of staff at the Force Headquarters and on board the Italian flagship. In addition, Germany is providing an undisclosed aircraft for long-range reconnaissance in support of the Aspides mission. The aircraft is flown by a civilian company but operated partly by military personnel. 'Germany will continue to make substantial contributions to Aspides,' the spokesperson from the German Ministry of Defense told TWZ. 'The contribution of warships at Aspides must be weighed against other operational commitments of the German Navy and is closely coordinated with our partners and the European Union. This process is ongoing and has not yet been finalized.' The same concerns that TWZ and others have raised about the missing air defense capability of the F125 Baden-Württemberg class have driven the decision for one of these frigates to avoid the Red Sea. As well as once again challenging the logic of the design of this warship, this is another reminder of the continuing threat posed to vessels of all kinds as the Houthis continue their anti-shipping campaign.

Ukrainian Defenses In The East Are Buckling, Russian Advance Is A...	Ukraine’s defenses in the Donetsk region are continuing to crumble. In the past week alone, the Russians have gained more land than at any point this year. 'The gain of more than 200 square kilometers (77 square miles) adds to territory taken in a grinding summer offensive that’s involved huge losses of Russian troops and equipment,' Bloomberg News reported, citing maps compiled by the DeepState open-source intelligence group's map service maintained in cooperation with the Ukrainian Defense Ministry. 'Russia has captured 1,146 square kilometers in Ukraine since Aug. 6, about a quarter more than in the first seven months of the year.' Russian Army advances in Ukraine this year (2024). pic.twitter.com/Gy1Jva4Biv&mdash; Clash Report (@clashreport) October 29, 2024 The Russians are chewing up large chunks of Donetsk in a move to capture the key logistics hub of Pokrovsk which could lead to a further breakout west toward Dnipropetrovsk and south toward Zaporizhia. Having captured the town of Selydovo earlier this week - its biggest regional prize since seizing Avdiikva - Russian forces are now pushing toward Kurakhov. Sitting astride the N-15 highway, the settlement is just south of a mile-wide stretch of the Vovcha River and supports the movement of troops and materiel in the region. As such, it is a bulwark on a Russian advance toward Pokrovsk about 20 miles to the north. Russian forces are now less than three miles from Kurakhov, according to DeepState. Control of that city is key to a pocket of Ukrainian-held territory that Russia is pushing toward from the north, east and south. A Russian mechanized column 'has already pushed into the city’s eastern outskirts..,' the independent Russian Meduza media outlet reported. 'Additional Russian units are pressing in from the north (from the direction of Selydove), and from the south (from the direction of Vuhledar),' which as we previously reported was captured early last month. 'Ukrainian defenses to the south of the city appear especially weak,' Meduza added. 'After a chaotic retreat from Vuhledar, the brigades seem worn out, and even reinforcements sent from Zaporizhzhia haven’t been enough to help.' As Meduza and other media outlets have noted, the advances 'are not without [Russian] equipment losses along the way.' Defenders managed to hold the encroachment at bay in part because of a line of dragon’s teeth that impeded the Russians, according to the Ukrainian Militarnyi outlet. A Russian armored convoy tried to break through this line of fortifications, but Ukrainian paratroopers of the 46th Separate Airmobile Brigade stopped it, the outlet reported, citing the brigade’s Telegram channel. The Russians were trying to bypass the road through a field from occupied Maksymilianivka towards Kurakhov. The brigade claimed that four Russian armored vehicles and two tanks in the assault were destroyed by 'artillery fire, FPV-drones, and remote-mining means.' Russian armor destroyed attacking Kurakhove. (46th Separate Airmobile Brigade screencap) Still, the defense of Kurakov is becoming increasingly difficult. 'The situation is really tense,' Orest Drymalovsky, a representative of the press service of Ukraine’s 79th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade said on national television, according to Radio Liberty’s Telegram. 'The enemy is trying to probe our defense every day. Every day they strike, every day they attack to break through the defense of the 79th Brigade and to encircle the city of Kurakhov even deeper.' Drmyalovsky added that the Russians 'are sending entire columns of equipment and personnel in the direction of the village of Konstantinovka near Kurakhov, and they are not sparing either soldiers or equipment.' 'Apparently, it is very important for the occupiers to straighten the front line in the Kurakhov direction, to push through the defense of the 79th Paratroopers in the area of ​​the villages of Konstantinovka, Antonovka, Yekaterinovka, where the enemy has not had success for a long time,' Drymalovskiy noted about settlements less than seven miles south of Kurakhove. 'And without this success, the occupiers will not be able to advance closer to the city of Kurakhov.' Russian sources, however, claim that at least part of that area has been captured. Ukraine 'has been knocked out' of Ilyinka,' according to noted Russian milblogger Yuriy Podolyak. That is a small settlement less than a half-mile north of Yekaterinovka. 'We are waiting for confirmation,' he added. 'What a great day. Kurakhov is quickly losing its significance for Ukraine.' 'According to preliminary information, Ilyinka and Stepanovka have been liberated by the Russian Army as part of the Russian Armed Forces' advance north of Kurakhov,' the Russian Warrior Kitten Telegram channel posited. Despite the Russian claims, the latest DeepState map shows that all five of those towns remain in Ukrainian hands. 'Fighting in the Kurakhov direction continues,' the Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff stated on Facebook. Near 'Ostrivsky, Illinka, Novoselidivka, Kremínnoí̈ Balka, Novodmitrivka, Vovchenko, Maximilyanivka, Dalnyi, Antonivka and Katerinivka, 24 combat clashes took place during the day, 13 attacks by the occupiers are ongoing.' There have been two dozen battles near Kurakhove today with more than half ongoing, according to the Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff. (Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff) Regardless of exactly where Russian troops are on the southern end of their push toward Kurakhov, their objective of taking the town appears to be gaining traction. Its fall would mark the latest in a string of defeats Ukraine has experienced in Donetsk against an increasingly overwhelming adversary that is willing to sacrifice large amounts of troops and equipment in the process. The Russian push is not limited to Pokrovsk. It is attacking all across Donetsk to press its advantage in personnel. Moscow is recruiting about 30,000 troops a month, according to The Economist, citing a NATO official. 'That is less than government targets, but is still enough to cover even the gargantuan losses of recent months,' the publication noted. 'On manpower, too, Russia remains solvent. Its army is recruiting around 30,000 men per month, says the nato official. That is not enough to meet internal targets, says another official, but it is adequate to cover even the gargantuan losses of recent months.'… pic.twitter.com/HAL6LcRtm4&mdash; Rob Lee (@RALee85) October 30, 2024 In addition to increasing the number of its own troops, Russia is seeing an influx of North Korean soldiers. As Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, head of the Ukrainian Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR) told us, there are some 12,000 North Korean troops in Russia, a figure that we noted could expand. Of those, about 7,200 are now in Kursk, Budanov told The War Zone on Friday. It is unclear at the moment how many North Korean troops might be sent into Ukraine or if more might be sent to bolster Russia's fight. Ukraine too is seeking to quickly bolster its forces. 'A further 160,000 people are to be drafted into the Ukrainian armed forces, which will raise the manning of units to 85%, National Security and Defense Council Secretary Oleksandr Lytvynenko said on Oct. 29 during a session of the Ukrainian parliament,' the Kyiv Independent reported. Ukraine's parliament adopted an updated mobilization law in mid-April to ramp up mobilization amid Russia's ongoing war, according to the outlet. 'The new law simplifies the process for identifying eligible conscripts and includes additional penalties for those dodging the draft. According to Lytvynenko, 1,000,050 citizens have been drafted into the military so far since the beginning of martial law.' Ukraine is set to mobilize around 160,000 troops over the next three months. pic.twitter.com/a9jxt8iXEq&mdash; Clash Report (@clashreport) October 29, 2024 With the speed and scope of this push picking up, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has increased the urgency of his complaints about Western support. 'Ukraine has received only 10% of the aid package approved by the U.S. Congress in 2024,' he said. 'This isn’t funny. The issue isn’t money, it’s bureaucracy and logistics.'

North Korea’s New ICBM May Have Biggest Transporter-Erector-Launc...	North Korea has tested an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that it claims is its longest-ranged so far — and which is carried on an absolutely enormous transporter-erector-launcher (TEL) vehicle. The announcement of the test of the Hwasong-19 comes amid large-scale U.S.-South Korean military maneuvers during which their aircraft have bombed mock-ups of North Korean ballistic missile launchers. These same exercises have also seen, for the first time, U.S. and South Korean drones working together to hunt targets — something that would be critical in a full-scale war to find and knock out North Korean missile launchers as quickly as possible. VIDEO: North Korean state media published footage of the launch of a new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) model called the 'Hwasong-19' on Thursday.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in front of the Hwasong-19 transporter-erector-launcher (TEL). KCNA KCNA Launch of the Hwasong-19. KCNA The size of the TEL is immediately impressive. With 11 axles, it’s notably longer than the nine-axle TEL used in the previous Hwasong-18, indicating that the missile is proportionally longer, too. Moreover, the relatively narrow driver cabs at the front of the Hwasong-19 vehicle also point to a larger-diameter missile. While North Korea has used an 11-axle TEL before, for its Hwasong-17, this missile was a less advanced liquid-fuel missile design. That TEL also didn't feature the smaller cab for the wider missile body as seen in the Hwasong-19's TEL setup. One of the notably narrow driver cabs at the front of the Hwasong-19 TEL vehicle.

Kim was again accompanied by his daughter to observe the launch, according to North Korean state media. Personnel involved in the missile test pose in front of the Hwasong-19. KCNA South Korean reaction to the test was swift, with Seoul imposing new sanctions on 11 North Korean individuals and four entities, which it says have contributed to missile and nuclear development, including by channeling illegal foreign funds into the country. North Korea has already demonstrated ICBMs with long enough range to hit targets almost anywhere in the United States, but the appearance of the Hwasong-19 demonstrates that the country is continuing to develop and refine these weapons — as well as use them to signal its military might. At the same time, it should be noted that questions still remain over the reliability of North Korean reentry vehicles and nuclear warheads. There is also the question of just how survivable the Hwasong-19 would be, simply due to its size. Its colossal dimensions mean there is only a limited number of places, including tunnels and some structures, where it can hide and the vehicle itself will be harder to maneuver than smaller TELs. Typically, super-heavy ICBMs of this kind are based in fixed silos, rather than being road-mobile. Reportedly, North Korea will field the Hwasong-19 alongside the previous Hwasong-18, which was its first solid-fuel ICBM, with analysts suggesting that the new missiles will offer an expanded capacity within a larger payload section. This would imply plans for it to carry larger warheads and multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs). The Hwasong-18 ICBM was first tested in April 2023. KCNA As we have discussed before, solid-fuel ICBMs, in general, offer huge advantages over previous liquid-fuel designs developed by North Korea. A solid-fuel missile can be brought into action far more quickly since it doesn’t need to be fueled before being launched, drastically reducing reaction time from receiving the order to launching. It also makes the missile much more survivable, dramatically reducing the window in which it could be targeted by a preemptive strike. The latest test not only confirms the continued maturation of North Korea’s strategic missile forces, and with it a growing deterrent capability, but also appears calculated to send a message to the United States, in particular. The timing of this messaging is notable for several reasons. Most immediately, the U.S. military and South Korean armed forces have been engaged in maneuvers in which aircraft — including drones — have been used to attack simulated North Korean targets. For the first time, these exercises have also involved drones from both countries. Today, the South Korean armed forces announced live-fire drills that saw U.S. Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drones drop GPS-guided munitions on targets while a Republic of Korea Air Force RQ-4B Global Hawk drone carried out intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR).

ROK Air Force As we have discussed in the past, any military campaign launched by the South against its neighbor would see extensive involvement by drones, which would be especially valuable for scouting for mobile targets, especially missile launchers, as well as keeping tabs on North Korean military movements on the ground. Meanwhile, U.S. and South Korean fighters also took part in the simulated bombing of North Korean targets — including ballistic missile launchers — on October 30, with 110 aircraft reportedly involved in the Freedom Flag 24-1 maneuvers. 'Through this large-scale joint air training exercise, we have demonstrated the South Korea-U.S. combined defense capability and posture to overwhelm the enemy in response to North Korea’s nuclear and missile threats,' South Korea’s joint chiefs of staff said in a statement.

ROK Air Force A simulated static target explodes after being struck by a GBU-12 lase-guided bomb during combined South Korean and U.S. air forces precision strike training as part of Freedom Flag 24-1. ROK Air Force Meanwhile, North Korea finds itself even more ostracized from the international community due to its support for Russia in its war in Ukraine, which now includes the direct involvement of soldiers from the Korean People’s Army. Neither Pyongyang nor Moscow have denied that North Korean soldiers are now fighting on the front lines in Ukraine, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has slammed his allies for having made 'zero' response to the development. North Korea’s deepening support for Russia’s war in Ukraine — which has also seen it transfer millions of rounds of artillery ammunition and short-range ballistic missiles — has sparked concerns that sensitive military technology could flow back to Pyongyang from Moscow in return. In particular, there have been suggestions that North Korea might gain further advantages in its ballistic missile program, aided by Russia.

Photo by Denys Glushko /Gwara Media/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images Global Images Ukraine Perhaps not surprisingly, given that the Hwasong-19 will have been in development for some time, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said that the Pentagon did not have 'any indication at this point that there was Russian involvement' in the latest ICBM test. However, Austin did note that the U.S. Department of Defense was still at a very early point in its assessment of the missile test. It is perhaps also no coincidence that the Hwasong-19 comes as the United States prepares for its presidential election, on November 5. Earlier this year, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said that his personal connection with Kim would be an advantage that he would use if elected. 'Now North Korea is acting up again, but when we get back, I get along with him,' he said. 'He’d like to see me back, too. I think he misses me.' Returning to the peninsula, the missile test comes during a period of overall worsening tensions between North and South Korea. Most recently, TWZ reported on North Korea’s accusations that South Korea has been using drones to scatter propaganda leaflets over Pyongyang. That development follows waves of excrement and trash-filled balloons that North Korea has launched into the South, a campaign that started this summer. A photo released by the North Korean state news agency KCNA that claims to show a South Korean drone used to drop propaganda leaflets over the North Korean capital last month. KCNA Last month, the North said it said it would sever road and railway access to the South to ensure the two countries are 'completely separate.' A string of incidents and a continued war of words has served to raise tensions and, with them, the risk of an overreaction or a misunderstanding leading to a much more serious escalation. With that in mind, the test of the Hwasong-19 is a sobering reminder of the growing strength of the North Korean strategic arsenal, which has continued to develop despite longstanding sanctions and international pressure.

Army Coyote Drone Hunting Drones Have Scored 170 Combat Kills	The Army has racked up 170 kills with Coyote counter-drone interceptors in operational deployments globally. This underscores Coyote's centrality in the service's arsenal of systems to help tackle growing threats posed by uncrewed aerial systems. Army officials highlighted Coyote's achievements at the Falcon Peak 2025, a counter-drone capabilities demonstration at Peterson Space Force Base in Colorado this week, which The War Zone and reporters from other outlets observered. The service currently has Coyotes deployed at 36 unspecified sites outside of the United States. A Coyote Block 2 interceptor. Raytheon 'So we're in [the] CENTCOM region, AFRICOM, [and] EUCOM,' Army Maj. Alyssa Tallmadge from the service's Program Executive Office for Missiles and Space told The War Zone's Howard Altman on Wednesday, referring to the top U.S. military commands in the Middle East, Africa, and Europe. 'As we're over there for Coyotse, we're at 170 successful kills in all those regions.' At Falcon Peak 2025, Tallmadge did not provide a more specific breakdown of kills per region or whether Coyotes have scored kills everywhere they have been deployed. The War Zone has reached out for more information. Operational use of these interceptors, which defense contractor Raytheon produces, in the Middle East has been previously reported. Coyotes were also notably among the defensive capabilities deployed to protect a temporary pier attached to the shore of the Gaza Strip that the U.S. military briefly operated to try to help get more humanitarian aid into the enclave earlier this year. The primary versions of Coyote that the Army currently employs in the counter-drone role is the jet-powered Block 2 variant and its subtypes, which use a high-explosive warhead to destroy their targets. The service has also been looking to acquire Block 3 versions based on the original electric motor-driven pusher propeller design carrying unspecified 'non-kinetic' payloads, which might include electronic warfare systems or high-power RF pulse payloads. The interceptors are part of a larger system of systems in Army service collectively referred to as the Low, Slow, Unmanned Aircraft Integrated Defeat System (LIDS), which includes mobile (M-LIDS) and fixed-site (FS-LIDS) components. The mobile end of LIDS currently includes multiple configurations of 4×4 M-ATV mine-resistant vehicles, including ones armed with Coyotes and 30mm XM914 automatic cannons, as well as radars and other sensors. The Army is now pursuing a new M-LIDS platform that consolidates all of the existing capabilities onto a single 8&#215;8 Stryker light armored vehicle. FS-LIDS includes palletized Coyote launchers and sensor systems that can be rapidly emplaced, including at remote and austere forward locations. A promotional shot showing the FS-LIDS launcher and radar components, as well as an M-LIDS vehicle in the middle. Raytheon The LIDS system of systems can be integrated into larger air and missile defense ecosystems using various network architectures. The FS-LIDS components at Falcon Peak 2025 were linked to additional sensors via a Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2) system and other networks during the demonstration. It's worth noting here the Army is also in the process of fielding a new over-arching air and missile defense-focused network called Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS), which is expected to eventually subsume many existing systems like FAAD C2, as you can read more about here. A graphic showing a general concept of deploying M-LIDS and FS-LIDS in combination with other sensors, effectors, and networking capabilities. US Army A graphic showing a general concept of deploying M-LIDS and FS-LIDS in combination with other sensors, effectors, and networking capabilities. This also highlights the kinds of threats the Coyote-based counter-drone systems are mean to defend against. US Army As noted earlier, it has already been clear that Coyote, together with the rest of LIDS, occupies a central place in the Army's current counter-drone arsenal, and that this only looks set to grow in the near term. Last year, the service disclosed plans to buy as many as 6,000 Block 2 and 700 Block 3 Coyotes, as well as hundreds more launchers and radars, between Fiscal Years 2025 (which started on October 1 of this year) and 2029. Earlier this year, the Army further announced plans to establish nine new dedicated 'counter-small UAS (C-sUAS) batteries' as part of a broader force restructuring focused heavily on expanding air and missile defense capabilities and capacity. How those batteries might be equipped is unclear, but giving them combat-proven Coyote interceptors and the rest of LIDS would be obvious potential options. At the same time, the Army has stressed the importance of taking a broader, layered approach to defeating drone threats that requires a wider array of capabilities. 'When I was at the Joint Counter-UAS Office, we&#8230; helped field some of the Coyote interceptors,' Army Lt. Gen. Sean Gainey told The War Zone and the other reporters at Falcon Peak 2025 this week. 'But also we fielded directed energy type of systems [that] work very well in the counter-UAS space, anywhere from 10 kilowatt systems all the way up to 50 kilowatt systems. And we are employing those type of systems globally right now.' Gainey is currently head of the Army's Space and Missile Defense Command (SDMC). It is important to point out here that Army officials have publicly acknowledged significant issues with certain counter-drone laser directed weapons that have been deployed to date. Still, the service has remained publicly very interested in this kind of capability. An 8&#215;8 Stryker-based laser directed energy weapon, one of a number of such systems in limited US Army service now. US Army One of the Army's initial prototype DE M-SHORAD vehicles. US Army 'There are also low-collateral interceptors, which I was pretty excited about in that [in] my previous capacity,' Gainey continued. 'And these are interceptors that would have some sort of onboard net capturing system, or streamers, or whatever, to be able to take down some of your smaller UAS. Again, part of the layer, not the sole system, to help you be able to get after several different [threat] systems.' Limitations with drones that fire nets or streamers have emerged, as well. Gainey also highlighted ongoing work to develop and field high power microwave directed energy weapons for counter-drone use, as well as 'soft kill' options, such as electronic warfare jamming. A rendering of a Stryker armed with a high-power microwave directed energy weapon. GDLS The Army is also known to be fielding or at least exploring a variety of other counter-drone capabilities, including containerized systems that fire 70mm laser-guided rockets and gun-armed 'robot dogs' and other uncrewed ground platforms. The service also recently demonstrated the ability of its AH-64 Apaches to engage uncrewed aerial threats with radar-guided AGM-114L Hellfire missiles. . @USArmy Soldiers engage an unmanned aerial system (UAS) from an AH-64 with upgraded Hellfire missile during Red Sands training exercise in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. @usarmycentral pic.twitter.com/HG9ChuWxt6&mdash; U.S. Central Command (@CENTCOM) September 30, 2024 Loitering counter-drone interceptors are increasingly entering the picture, as well. Defense contractor Anduril just announced earlier this month that it had received major new U.S. miltiary contracts to ramp up deliveries of its jet-powered Roadrunner-M, which can also be reused if it doesn't execute an intercept. Regardless, 'you have to have a system of systems approach, in layers, where you have the ability to not only have RF [radiofrequency electronic warfare jamming], but also sensor/detectors, and also a complement of some type of kinetic effector, to give you the ability [to respond] across a range of threats,' Lt. Gen. Gainey stressed. 'Obviously, adversaries are looking for opportunities to outpace what we're producing. So if you employ capability in a layered approach, [it] is where you see the best opportunities for success.' It's worth noting that Gainey's comments here came as other U.S. military officials at Falcon Peak 2025 stressed that they are not interested, at least for now, in using kinetic effectors, such as surface-to-air interceptors or gun-based systems, or directed energy weapons to defend domestic facilities and assets against uncrewed aerial systems. This is despite a steady stream of glaringly concerning drone incidents over and around U.S. military bases, training ranges, and warships offshore, along with critical civilian infrastructure. Often confusing authorities and policies for deploying and employing anti-drone capabilities within the U.S. homeland, as well as concerns about collateral damage, have a significant impact on the current domestic counter-drone landscape. You can read more about these issues and their broader implications in other recent War Zone reporting from Falcon Peak 2025 here. As The War Zone has highlighted many times in the past, the U.S. military continues to very much be playing catch-up to drone threats, which are not new and continue to rapidly evolve, even when it comes to protecting forces deployed down-range. The ongoing war in Ukraine, where various tiers of drones are employed on a daily basis on both sides, together with crises in and around the Red Sea and elsewhere in the Middle, have provided significant new emphasis for the already urgent need for more defensive capabilities. In the meantime, Coyote interceptors do continue to prove their worth overseas as part of a counter-drone arsenal the Army is still working to expand capabilities.

Lasers, Microwaves, Missiles, Guns Not On The Table For Domestic ...	The U.S. military isn't currently interested in fielding kinetic and directed energy capabilities, such as laser and high-power microwave weapons, surface-to-air interceptors, and gun systems, for defending domestic bases and other critical infrastructure from rapidly growing and evolving drone threats. Instead, the focus is on electronic warfare and cyber warfare, and other 'soft-kill' options, at least for the time being. Still often confusing legal and regulatory hurdles that limit how and when counter-drone systems of any kind can be employed within the homeland are key drivers behind the U.S. military's current plans. Concerns about risks of collateral damage resulting from the use of anti-drone capabilities factor in heavily, too. This all, in turn, raises questions about the potential for serious gaps in the currently allowable but still largely non-existent domestic drone defense ecosystem. U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) Deputy Test Director Jason Mayes spoke yesterday about these plans and related issues with a small group of reporters including from The War Zone at Falcon Peak 2025, a counter-drone experiment at Peterson Space Force Base. NORTHCOM is headquartered at Peterson, as is the U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), and the two share the same commander. 'We are focused on [counter-drone] technologies that have potential, not saying they're completely approved yet, but potential for use in the homeland, specifically,' Mayes explained. 'So we're not bringing out stuff that's&#8230; like the kinetic kill [capabilities]&#8230; that you're seeing over in CENTCOM [U.S. Central Command] and AFRICOM [U.S. Africa Command].' A system designed to detect drones via the radiofrequency signals they put out and hijack the control link between them and their operators on display at Falcon Peak 2025. Howard Altman Various tiers of drones present ever-growing threats on and off traditional battlefields. This is a reality that is not at all new at this point, but that has finally been rammed into the mainstream discourse thanks in large part to the ongoing war in Ukraine, as well as various crises in and around the Middle East. A series of still-unexplained drone incursions over Langley Air Force Base in Virginia over the course of several weeks in December 2023, which The War Zone was first to report on, is a particularly prime example of the potential dangers all of this poses to the U.S. homeland. We have reported for years now on other glaringly concerning incidents in and around the United States impacting military bases, training ranges, and warships offshore, as well as critical civilian infrastructure. Several companies brought counter-drone systems to demonstrate at Falcon Peak 2025, many of which center on defeating or at least disrupting targets via jamming GPS and other RF signals. There are also others that utilize more novel capabilities, including systems designed to hijack line-of-sight control links between a drone and its operator and drones that can fire nets or stringy streamers at other uncrewed aerial systems in flight. While potentially deployable within the current regulatory framework, these systems have very clear limitations. This counter-drone system from Leidos demonstrated at Falcon Peak 2025 includes a drone that fires stringy streamers at other uncrewed aerial systems. Howard Altman It is useful here to step back and think about the current counter-drone ecosystem from the perspective of tiered capabilities (and associated rules of engagement) starting at the very lowest end with systems intended to increase situational awareness, typically through passive signal detection and tracking. This is where a drone is detected and tracked via its own electronic emissions. The next step up is active sensors, generally radars, that can track the drone regardless of it emitting radio frequency energy or not. Both passive and active systems are often paired with electro-optical and infrared cameras to help with positively identifying targets. Moving further up the capability ladder, there are non-kinetic 'soft kill' defense options like electronic warfare, followed by directed energy weapons like lasers and high-power microwaves, and finally more traditional kinetic effectors like drone-hunting drones, anti-aircraft guns, and surface-to-air missiles. There are some outlier systems like drones that might fire things like nets, streamers or goo, or use electronic pulses to disable a drone, which fall somewhere near the same category directed energy. 'There are kinetic options&#8230;. They're just not here,' NORTHCOM's Mayes said. 'Many of them [existing counter-drone systems] do have the ability to integrate with a kinetic type [of capability]. &#8230;. But again, it's not something we were super interested in that regard.' He highlighted the 20mm Vulcan cannon-armed Centurion C-RAM (Counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar) and the Coyote counter-drone interceptor as being among such capabilities in U.S. military service now. 'They're not appropriate for the homeland,' Mayes added. When it comes to discussions about domestic drone defense within the borders of the United States, the point here about appropriateness is perhaps more important than any discussions about specific capabilities. A multi-faceted layered defensive architecture featuring various components from the aforementioned tiers would be the best for providing a broad scope of coverage against uncrewed aerial threats. 'So that's the obstacle, right? The policies and the legalities of being able to use the systems, absolutely,' Mayes said. 'Net capture would be a fantastic asset on an installation,' he continued, using that capability as one example. 'But it's semi-autonomous, flying over top of people, capturing drones&#8230; and then you get into the engagement authorities for all that stuff when you talk 130i and all that, right?' '130(i)' here refers to that subsection of Title 10 of the U.S. Code (10 USC 130i), which covers current authorities for the 'protection of certain facilities and assets from unmanned aircraft.' Under 130i, the U.S. military has the authority to take 'action' to defend against drones including with measures to 'disrupt control of the unmanned aircraft system or unmanned aircraft, without prior consent, including by disabling the unmanned aircraft system or unmanned aircraft by intercepting, interfering, or causing interference with wire, oral, electronic, or radio communications used to control the unmanned aircraft system or unmanned aircraft' and the 'use reasonable force to disable, damage, or destroy the unmanned aircraft system or unmanned aircraft.' A full list of the kinds of 'action' authorized under 10 USC 130i. Cornell Law School At the same time, the statute as it currently exists stipulates that 'the Secretary of Defense shall coordinate with the Secretary of Transportation and the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] before issuing any guidance or otherwise implementing this section if such guidance or implementation might affect aviation safety, civilian aviation and aerospace operations, aircraft airworthiness, or the use of airspace.' There are notable caveats about the 'covered facility or asset[s]' the law applies to, as well. A specific list provided in the statute is focused largely on top-tier national security sites and assets, including those related to nuclear deterrence, protecting the President and Vice President, the nation's air and missile defense networks, and space launch activities. The U.S. military does also reserve its inherent right to act outside of this authority in self-defense. 'Covered facility or asset' as defined by 10 USC 130i Cornell Law School Despite efforts in recent years to expand domestic counter-drone authorities across the U.S. government, 10 USC 130i, as well as other legal and regulatory frameworks, continue to impose significant limitations on how and when assets can be deployed and employed. U.S. Air Force Officials at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina specifically cited 10 USC 130i as impacting their decision to explore installing entirely passive physical counter-drone defenses. Authorities at Langley Air Force Base are also looking into improving their defenses against uncrewed aerial systems by adding nets to open-ended sunshade-type shelters. The War Zone was first to report on both of these developments. A graphic offering general details about the sunshade-type shelters at Langley that could now be in line to receive anti-drone nets. USAF NORTHCOM's Mayes highlighted how these issues are impacting plans to expand the use of even electronic warfare capabilities. 'Given the impact of GPS denial, just across infrastructure and all that stuff, it is a very, very difficult capability to get permissions to utilize' even for limited and heavily structured test events like Falcon Peak 2025, Mayes explained. Planners for the experiment were presented with the need to provide 30 to 45 days of lead time to unspecified agencies to get the required approval. 'Once we started talking to them and telling them, you know, if this were a real-world scenario where we are actively trying to get capability into an installation in a prolonged incident of some sort, right, we don't have 30-45 days,' Mayes said. 'And we said, this is a data point that we're actually trying to collect in the process &#8230; how quick can we move this through, so that an installation commander that has concerns over what's happening has the ability to flip the switch on some of these GPS denial capabilities to protect his assets, right?' 'I think, in real-time, we would probably be able to do it very quickly,' he added, but also highlighted the importance of increased coordination with agencies outside of the Department of Defense on counter-drone issues, which NORTHCOM says it is working on. The drone incursions over Langley last December, especially, have highlighted the importance of being able to rapidly respond to such incidents. There are other past incidents that provide evidence of difficulties in quickly reacting to potentially malicious domestic drone activity. For instance, we know authorities were still in the process of approving the deployment of a domain awareness-type counter-drone system days after multiple still-unexplained drone incursions over the Palo Verde nuclear power plant in Arizona in 2019. The FAA also only imposed temporary flight restrictions around Air Force Plant 42, a top hub for advanced aerospace development work including on the B-21 Raider stealth bomber, in August of this year after months of drone incursions there. These are events that The War Zone again was first to report on. Mayes also stressed the need for greater clarity on existing authorities to make sure U.S. commanders know what options are available to them and are willing to employ them without fear of inadvertent repercussions. 'There's a lot of policy, and there's some, you know, I wouldn't call them gaps, per se, but there's some areas where you've got one policy saying one [thing], another policy saying another, and the parts where they cross over get a little blurry.. and just confusing,' Mayes said, noting that this applies to internal U.S. military policies, as well. 'So I think we need to solidify all that.' A trailer-mounted Sentry Tower domain awareness system from Anduril at Falcon Peak 2025. Howard Altman 'I think we need to clarify it [the policies] a little bit and establish a better understanding of that at the installation commanders level, who's responsible for this, right, so that they feel, you know, a little more comfortable in telling their troop[s], yes, we need to pull that [drone] down,' he added. Even if counter-drone policies are clarified and solidified, and authorities get expanded, there are still other concerns at play, especially when it comes to collateral damage. Shooting something down with a gun-based system or a surface-to-air missile carries inherent dangers of projectiles or interceptors, or debris from them, falling onto innocent bystanders below. The aforementioned Centurion C-RAM fires specialized self-destructing ammunition to reduce these risks. The drone, or what is left of it, which could include undetonated explosive warheads or other potentially hazardous payloads, would also fall to Earth in an uncontrolled manner after any such engagement. Maybe even more importantly is that these weapons do fail and they are packed with high explosives and traveling at high speed, which could cause very unpredictable harm to people and property in a large potential impact area. Then there is the idea that you have to know exactly what you are shooting at, and that can be harder than it sounds when dealing with strange objects in the sky, especially in populated areas where civilian air traffic is dense. Making the call to shoot down an object over the U.S. is an incredibly complex task that never actually occurred until recently. The U.S. military's decision to shoot down a Chinese spy balloon in 2023 only after it had passed out over the Atlantic, as well as the downing of three other still-unidentified objects that year in U.S. and Canadian airspace over water or very sparsely populated areas on land, underscores these risk assessment considerations. The War Zone highlighted these issues at the time. It is worth noting here that the U.S. military does have traditional gun-based air defense and surface-to-air missile systems arrayed around Washington, D.C., as well as various counter-drone systems. Details about the rules surrounding their employment are limited, but might help provide something of a model for deploying and employing expanded domestic anti-drone defenses. The U.S. military has also at least explored the idea in recent years of re-establishing a network of traditional surface-to-air missile sites to defend the homeland from various air and missile threats, which would have had to have touched on many of the same kinds of policy questions. At the same time, even lower tiers of counter-drone weapons, such as lasers and high-power microwave systems, can create dangerous or otherwise serious collateral effects. 'I think that we could get to a point where we have approval for that here in the homeland,' Mayes said of laser directed energy weapons for counter-drone use. 'The biggest thing right now is the impact of the laser when it moves beyond its target. You know, how far is it going? What's that going to do? How long does the laser need to remain on target before it begins to inflict damage and so on, right?' Mayes raised questions about whether the laser beam could impact aircraft or even satellites passing by, as well as things on the ground like 'hikers up on a hill.' The video below shows a test of a U.S. Navy shipboard laser directed energy weapon capable of being employed against drones. 'You have issues sometimes, when it comes to [high-power] microwaves, that, you know, emitting those out into an area, especially a populated area, it could become a problem, even if it's physically okay for the population,' he added. Omnidirectional electronic warfare jamming, whether of GPS or other RF signals, presents its own issues. It has the potential to disrupt nearby communications and RF-based instrumentation, including ones that drone defenders themselves might be utilizing to try to coordinate and do their job. Civilian frequencies could also be impacted, causing unwanted disruptions. Counter-drone jamming 'guns' that offer highly directional fields of fire have proven popular in part because of this reality, although their efficacy is spotty. A US Marine wields a counter-drone jamming 'gun' during training. USMC All of this in turn prompts questions about the potential for gaping capability and capacity gaps in the kinds of drone defense architecture the U.S. military is looking at currently. Even under the best circumstances, essentially relying on electronic warfare alone as the means of actually defeating or disrupting potentially hostile drones presents clear limitations. GPS guidance is already passive, presenting RF detection and engagement challenges, and further advances in autonomy, which are steadily proliferating, could further limit the utility of certain electronic warfare capabilities. Even today, commercial drones can be programmed to fly a certain route to a precise set of coordinates without anyone controlling them and they can remain aloft even when GPS is disrupted. This makes detecting and countering them with electronic warfare tactics very problematic if not impossible in certain scenarios. Looking for novel low-collateral options, such as the net or streamer-launching drones, to avoid using more traditional kinetic effectors or directed energy weapons is already proving challenging. Mayes said that low-collateral drone-on-drone capabilities currently seem best suited to tackling what he described as 'the careless and clueless,' or targets that, for whatever reason, keep a steady and relatively slow flight profile. 'Anytime that you are flying anything that's potentially chasing something else, if the other thing is faster or more agile, you're not going to catch it, right?' NORTHCOM's Mayes said today. 'Once you start getting into some of the faster [uncrewed aerial systems] like your FPV drones, your first-person view drones, these racing ones that are [capable of getting up to] 150-200 miles an hour, or drones that have been outfitted to be very agile, just the systems themselves are not able to keep up with that.' 'The demo that we did&#8230; [at Falcon Peak 2025] was more of a what we call defense mode, so kind of a point-point solution, like protection of a specific area or defending an area defending a point so the defense, defense mode allows the drone hunter to position itself much like a hockey goalie, soccer goalie, and keep a target from achieving its final destination,' Spencer Proust, Executive Vice President of Solution Engineering at Fortem Technologies, told The War Zone in response to related questions about the performance of the company's net-launching DroneHunter uncrewed aerial system. Attack mode would be much more like a dog fight, where it will chase its target, shoot it down, but when I say shoot it down, it actually has this particular system has two net guns on the front of it,' Proust added. 'It is not designed to chase down FPV drones, but that's why we have the [intercept-focused] defense mode.' Fortem does also say right on its website that DroneHunter is more of an 'effective back up layer to any antiaircraft missile defense systems' when it comes to faster and/or higher-flying threats. It's also worth noting that drone-on-drone combat has become commonplace in the conflict in Ukraine and there are claims that new defensive countermeasures are already emerging.

At the same time, these issues are not new, nor are the threats, and the U.S. government-wide lag in addressing them only continues to be more pronounced. Underscoring this is the fact that Falcon Peak 2025 is in no way the first such demonstration of potential capabilities. They have been going on for many years, often featuring very similar systems, with action even for the U.S. military's deployed forces only really ramping up once drones were raining down on allied fighters in Iraq during the battle of Mosul. You can read more about this glaring oversight here and here. In the meantime, drone threats continue to proliferate globally among state and non-state actors, including organized criminal groups. The barrier to entry to acquiring and employing armed drones, especially weaponized commercial types, is and has been low. To reiterate, these threats are real now and already exist in forms that could relatively easily overcome the limited array of drone defenses the U.S. military is currently looking at deploying domestically, especially if employed in large groups to say nothing of truly networked swarms. As already mentioned, the world also now looks to be on the verge of major new technological milestones in the lower-end uncrewed aerial system space, particularly when it comes to more autonomous targeting, driven heavily by advances in artificial intelligence, as you can read more about in this War Zone feature. Some of the responsibility for addressing these issues certainly falls to Congress, action from which would be required to alter things like 10 USC 130i or to establish new counter-drone legal frameworks. Legislators are clearly aware of this and a number of relevant legislative proposals have been put forward just in the past few months. The work NORTHCOM is doing through Falcon Peak 2025 is clearly meant to reflect a new push to address now long-standing demand for counter-drone defenses within the homeland. However, the event has also underscored significant barriers that remain in fielding these critical capabilities domestically, to that point that lasers, high-power microwaves, and other kinetic effectors are not even on the table, at least for the time being.

Final Conclusions On Bizarre Crash Of ‘Zombie’ F-35B That Flew Wi...	The USMC has released its final conclusions regarding its investigation into the bizarre loss of an F-35B that crashed in South Carolina on September 17th of last year. The Marines say that the mishap was caused primarily by pilot error, stating that 'the pilot incorrectly diagnosed an out-of-controlled flight emergency and ejected from a flyable aircraft, albeit during a heavy rainstorm compounded with aircraft electrical and display malfunctions.' The jet went on to continue flying without a pilot for over 60 miles before slamming into a field. Thankfully, nobody was injured as a result of the incident. You can read our last in a number of reports on the F-35B's 'ghost ship'-like mishap here. The release from the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing summarizes the circumstances of the crash as they are now known: 'On the afternoon of Sept. 17, 2023, a U.S. Marine Corps F-35B Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, assigned to Marine Fighter Attack Training Squadron (VMFAT) 501, 2nd MAW, crashed in South Carolina. The pilot safely ejected from the aircraft while attempting to execute a climbout during a missed approach in instrument meteorological conditions and heavy precipitation near Joint Base Charleston, South Carolina. The aircraft continued to fly unmanned for 11 minutes and 21 seconds before impacting in a rural area approximately 64 nautical miles northeast of the airfield in Williamsburg County, South Carolina. &#8230; The investigation concluded the pilot’s decision to eject was ultimately inappropriate because commanded-flight inputs were in progress at the time of ejection, standby flight instrumentation was providing accurate data, and the aircraft’s backup radio was, at least partially, functional. Furthermore, the aircraft continued to fly for an extended period after ejection.' F-35B in STOVL configuration. (USAF) The release goes on to describe other issues that contributed to the loss of the F-35B, including a cascade of systems failures throughout the jet: 'Contributing factors to the mishap included an electrical event during flight, which induced failures of both primary radios, the transponder, the tactical air navigation system, and the instrument landing system; and the probability that the helmet-mounted display and panoramic cockpit display were not operational for at least three distinct periods. This caused the pilot to become disoriented in challenging instrument and meteorological conditions. This electrical malfunction was not related to any maintenance activities. All preventative, scheduled, and unscheduled maintenance conducted on the aircraft was correct and in keeping with established standards. The pilot was qualified and current to conduct the scheduled flight. The flight was scheduled, planned, briefed, and conducted properly, professionally, and in accordance with applicable orders and directives. The forecasted and observed weather at the time of the mishap supported the decision to land back at Joint Base Charleston. The investigation concludes the mishap aircraft’s extended unmanned flight was due to stability provided by the F-35’s advanced automatic flight-control systems. The loss of positive radar contact with the mishap aircraft resulted from a failed transponder caused by the electrical malfunction and the aircraft’s eventual descent below the air-traffic control radar horizon. The loss of positive contact could also be partially attributed to the F-35B’s low-observable technology.' To go along with the ATC audio put together by Aeroscout, here's the full radio traffic from Charleston County EMS/Fire for the #F35 pilot ejection beginning from the initial dispatch until they cleared the scene.

Engine fan, landing gear, and other debris found at the area where the F-35B impacted the ground.

You can check out the initial detailed report on the crash published earlier this year here. So there you have it, finally we get the USMC's conclusions to what was a the time a very strange mishap that thankfully ended up with just the loss of an aircraft, albeit a prized and very expensive one.

Two New Versions Of China’s J-15 Carrier Fighter Now Appear To Be...	The Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy, or PLAN has for the first time conducted dual-carrier operations in the South China Sea. The drills, involving the country’s first two in-service carriers, the Liaoning and Shandong, as well as at least 11 other vessels, also showcased the PLAN’s fast-growing air wing. This revealed that both the upgraded J-15B single-seat multirole fighter and probably also the J-15D two-seat electronic warfare jet are likely now in operational service. Between them, these new versions of the J-15 Flanker carrier-based fighter point to the rapid progress made by the PLAN in developing more advanced aircraft that operate from its expanding aircraft carrier fleet. 等了近5年的双航母编队 pic.twitter.com/6ph4cWyZbU&mdash; 逆袭 (@horobeyo) October 31, 2024 Photos and a video of the dual-carrier maneuvers were recently released by Chinese state media, although it’s unclear exactly when they date from. While clearly engineered for public consumption — including a flyby conducted by a dozen J-15s overhead the flotilla — the photo opportunity also points to how the PLAN is developing its wider blue-water capabilities, including the vessels required to support carriers on long, out-of-area deployments. At the same time, the similarity between this photo exercise (PHOTEX) and the kinds staged by the U.S. Navy — including in the Indo-Pacific region — is remarkable. The dramatic overhead formation of J-15 fighters — something that is also familiar from U.S. Navy PHOTEXes involving carriers — includes a group of 12 jets, also seen separated into six-ship flights. Meanwhile, another 18 J-15s were visible on the deck of the Shandong at the time of the flyby, with at least two more spotted on the Liaoning. - J-15B has light grey radome, are the CATOBAR compatible, 4.5th gen (new weapons, avionics AESA etc) variant, marked red- J-15/A has dark grey radome, STOBAR production/old version, 4th gen, marked greenIn flight I see 9 J-15B, 2 J-15A, but happy for other opinions. pic.twitter.com/4Hgl43P9bq&mdash; Rick Joe (@RickJoe_PLA) October 31, 2024 The fighters include both the original J-15 versions, which are equipped for short takeoff but assisted recovery (STOBAR) operations, and the more modern J-15B, which can also conduct catapult takeoff but assisted recovery (CATOBAR) operations. Bearing in mind the J-15B wasn’t known to be in operational service, the number of these particular versions involved (at least 15) makes it all the more notable. What do you think about this J-15-count? I see 16 regular J-15, 13 J-15B and maybe 2 J-15D! pic.twitter.com/g7KFRhXiue&mdash; @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) October 31, 2024 The J-15B is significantly more capable than the earlier J-15 and J-15A. Its CATOBAR features were first tested on the J-15T prototype, which added a strengthened nose landing gear with an accompanying catapult launch bar. The series-production J-15B also has a new active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar (under a darker-colored radome, with no pitot tube) and a more modern cockpit. While most J-15Bs still retain the tried and tested AL-31F engines, this version has also been tested with domestically produced WS-10 turbofans. This could be another major surprise The PLAN Naval Aviation converted at least one J-15 to WS-10B engines replacing the standard Russian AL-31F, so after only a few prototypes tested it in the early phase, this is eventually a hint that the WS-10 is ready for the J-15 too. pic.twitter.com/sTwdVnQU2k&mdash; @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) November 23, 2022 Less obvious, however, are the two J-15D electronic warfare jets, broadly similar to the U.S. Navy’s EA-18G Growler, but likely also possessing a secondary strike mission. These are seen parked immediately alongside the island on the Shandong. While they appear to be distinguished by their tandem two-seat cockpits and humped forward fuselages, we cannot entirely rule out the possibility that these are single-seaters. Reports suggest that the prototype J-15D first flew in late 2016. Like the land-based J-16D, this variant is characterized by large wingtip electronic warfare pods and it has the standard infrared search and track (IRST) sensor and cannon removed. Additional conformal and blade antennas are located around the airframe and further EW pods can be carried under the wings and below the fuselage.

Instead, the PLAN’s first two carriers use a ‘ski-jump’ takeoff ramp to launch fixed-wing aircraft.

This ships can be identified are three Type 055 Renhai class destroyers, four Type 052D Luyang III class destroyers, one Type 054A Jiangkai II class frigate, and two Type 901 Fuyu class fast combat support ships. Twelve J-15s over the PLAN dual-carrier group. Chinese Internet via X Two support vessels were at the rear of the flotilla. Chinese Internet via X Typically, the Liaoning and Shandong go to sea with air wings made up of up to a maximum of 24 J-15 fighters. These are generally supported by around two Z-18F anti-submarine warfare helicopters, two Z-18JA airborne early warning helicopters, and a pair of smaller Z-9 helicopters for plane-guard and general utility duties. It should be noted that the Liaoning and Shandong have been at sea simultaneously before but have never been seen in such close proximity. There were also reports last month that the PLAN put three aircraft carriers to sea at the same time, although one of these, the Fujian, is not yet operational, while the Liaoning and Shandong were operating a significant distance apart: in the Philippine Sea and off Hainan Island, respectively. The aircraft carrier Liaoning at the front of the flotilla. In this photo, the censor has removed the pennant number from the front end of the flight deck. Chinese Internet via X The fact that these recent maneuvers were documented in the highly strategic South China Sea is also no coincidence. Beijing claims almost all of these waters as its own, resulting in numerous disputes and standoffs with other nations in this region, and these kinds of naval drills are very much in keeping with China’s military signaling here. Looking at the development of the carrier-based Flanker versions in more detail, the J-15 is the Chinese equivalent of the Soviet-designed Su-33 Flanker, a prototype of which China secured from Ukraine to assist in reverse engineering it. Unlike the Su-33, the J-15 has a multirole capability, since it incorporates avionics from the land-based J-11B fighter, although it retains the Russian-made AL-31F turbofans, unlike other Chinese Flanker versions now in production. The J-15A designation is sometimes applied to a slightly improved later-production version, with some additional precision-guided weapons options. As for the new J-15B, as well as its enhanced capabilities, this provides the PLAN with its first experience of CATOBAR operations, which will be fundamental to getting the most out of its future carriers, starting with the Fujian, which is equipped with an electromagnetic aircraft launch system (EMALS), something that remains a relatively new and complex technology. In the meantime, the J-15B and J-15D can clearly also be operated in STOBAR mode, which provides the air wings of the Liaoning and Shandong with a more capable fighter compared to the original J-15. It should be noted that the PLAN is also exploring other carrier-based Flanker versions, to further expand the mission spectrum and capabilities of its carrier air wings. These include the two-seat J-15S, which some analysts assume will be initially used as a trainer, but which will likely also inform the development of a two-seat carrier-based multirole strike and electronic warfare platform, which may be designated J-17. A multirole-capable two-seater would also be relevant for other more complex missions, including long-range air defense or even working as a command and control platform for combat drones. Taken from a TV news report, this image shows an operational J-15S in its PLAN colors, parked alongside a single-seat J-15. Chinese Internet via X Ultimately, however, the CATOBAR-capable J-15 and other new Chinese carrier-based Flanker versions will likely be a stepping-stone toward the more advanced capabilities that will be offered by the PLAN’s next carrier fighter, the stealthy J-35, developed from the land-based FC-31. While the J-35 was designed from the ground up for CATOBAR operations, aboard the Fujian and subsequent carriers, there are also signs that it, like the J-15B and J-15D, might also eventually embark on the Liaoning and Shandong. A close-up view of mockups of the J-35 and a J-15 variant aboard the Liaoning earlier this year. Chinese Internet via X As we have discussed before, having the J-35 join the air wing of the Liaoning and Shandong would be a significant boost. In addition to its low-observable characteristics, it’s assumed that the production aircraft will feature an advanced AESA radar among a host of modern sensors and very capable weaponry. The downside, as with putting the J-15B aboard the Liaoning and Shandong is that all these aircraft would have to launch off the bow ramp, limiting their payloads. However, as we’ve pointed out in the past, the J-35, which is intended to carry more limited stores internally, may be less dramatically affected than other types. A J-35 carrier-based stealth fighter prototype. Chinese Internet via X The navalized J-35 — this time not a mockup. Chinese internet Perhaps most importantly, integrating the CATOBAR-capable J-15B and J-15D and perhaps also the J-35B into the air wings of China’s first two carriers will provide very valuable experience for pilots, maintainers, and the wider PLAN. After all, the PLAN’s carrier aviation arm is still very much in its infancy, but it has bold ambitions. As well as the Fujian, which is now under test, and the J-35, the PLAN is looking forward to introducing the KJ-600 carrier-based radar plane, which will play a role analogous to the E-2 Hawkeye as a critical force-multiplier. The size and weight of the KJ-600 will preclude it from going to sea aboard the Liaoning and Shandong. Carrier-based drones, including unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs), are also a growing area of interest for the PLAN and it’s now widely expected that the Fujian, at least, will eventually embark a low-observable UCAV that will offer strike, surveillance, and targeting capabilities. An artist’s concept of a future Chinese aircraft carrier. Chinese internet via @HenriKenhmann After the Fujian, China is also widely expected to introduce more fully locally designed carriers, perhaps even with nuclear propulsion rather than the conventional powerplants used in its first three flattops. In the meantime, the recent photo opportunity showing the PLAN’s dual-carrier operations and the expanding capabilities of its air wing, provide yet another indication of China’s expanding naval presence, especially in terms of its steadily growing carrier force.

Oldest Arleigh Burke Destroyers Get Reprieve, Service Extended In...	The U.S. Navy plans to keep 12 more of its Flight I Arleigh Burke class destroyers in service beyond their originally 35-year expected service life. Some of the ships, which could also be in line for important upgrades to their defensive and offensive capabilities, are now set to keep sailing into the 2030s. The life extension decision is part of an ambitious Navy-wide strategy rolled out earlier this year that includes a major focus on increasing the readiness of warships and other key assets. The Navy announced the new decision regarding the Flight I Arleigh Burkes, which Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro approved, in a press release today. At present, the service has 73 Arleigh Burke destroyers in service, in total. This includes 21 Flight I ships, as well as a mixture of Flight II, IIA, and III types with successive improvements. The USS John Paul Jones, one of the Navy's Flight I Arleigh Burke class destroyers. USN The Navy has been eyeing Arleigh Burke service life extensions since at least 2018. In March 2023, it announced that the USS Arleigh Burke would remain in service into 2031. Last August, the service disclosed additional plans to stretch out the service life of four more Flight I Burkes, the USS Ramage, USS Benfold, USS Mitscher, and USS Milius to between 2034 and 2036. The Navy did not name the ships included in the latest life extension plans. 'The decision, based upon a hull-by-hull evaluation of ship material condition, combat capability, technical feasibility and lifecycle maintenance requirements, will result in an additional 48 ship-years of cumulative ship service life in the 2028 to 2035 timeframe,' the Navy said today in regard to the new life extension announcement. 'The Navy has proposed DDG service life extension funding in the FY26 budget request, and will update the shipbuilding plan accordingly.' 'At the Secretary’s request, the Navy conducted a thorough evaluation of each DDG-51 Flight I ship (DDG 51-71) over the past ten months, and determined the 12 destroyers could and should remain operational beyond their expected service life,' the service's release adds. 'The final determination of each ship’s service life is based on maximizing the service life of each ship before it required another extensive and costly docking availability.' The decision by the Navy to extend the service life of more Flight I Burkes is not necessarily surprising. Arleigh Burke class destroyers currently make up the plurality of the service's surface warfare fleets. The Flight I Burkes, which entered service in the 1990s, are still very capable ships. Each one notably has 90 strike-length Mk 41 Vertical Launch System cells that can be loaded with a variety of missiles, including Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles and SM-2 surface-to-air missiles. Flight I Burkes have already received multiple upgrades over the years and are now in line to receive new updates to their defensive capabilities in the form of new launchers for RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM). This is part of a broader plan to replace the Phalanx Close-In Weapon Systems (CIWS) on all Arleigh Burke class destroyers with different kinds of RAM launchers depending on subvariant, as you can read more about here. At least eight Arleigh Burkes already have SeaRAM systems, which they received along with additional electronic warfare capabilities, as part of what is known as the ‘Rota’ configuration developed for destroyers in this class forward based at Rota, Spain. In addition, the Navy is exploring the possibility of adding new stealthy Naval Strike Missile (NSM) anti-ship cruise missiles, which also have a secondary land-attack capability, to the Flight I Burkes' arsenal. The USS Fitzgerald has already been armed in this way and demonstrated this capability as a proof of concept that the service says will inform decisions going forward. The USS Fitzgerald fires a Naval Strike Missile (NSM) cruise missile during the 2024 Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise. USN Petty Officer 2nd Class Jordan Jennings The centrality of the Arleigh Burke class overall and the value of the Flight I ships specifically, especially their VLS cells, is only set to increase in the near term, especially with the impending retirement of the last of the Ticonderoga class cruisers. Each Ticonderoga has 122 Mk 41 VLS cells. Navy plans to decommission the four heavily in-demand Ohio class guided missile submarines, which can be armed with a maximum of 154 Tomahawks, before the end of the decade will only further diminish the service's overall missile launch capacity at a very inconvenient time. The importance of Arleigh Burkes has already been on full display in the past year or so in operations in and around the Red Sea and in the defense of Israel. The USS Arleigh Burke and USS Carney, another Flight I type, were among the U.S. ships that helped knock down Iranian missiles and drones heading toward Israeli targets in April. By that time, Carney had already been heavily engaged in the Red Sea against threats launched by Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen. The Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Carney sailing in the Red Sea fires a surface-to-air missile at Houthi threats on October 19, 2023. USN The Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Carney fires a surface-to-air missile at Houthi threats on October 19, 2023. USN 'Extending these highly-capable, well-maintained destroyers will further bolster our numbers as new construction warships join the Fleet,' Secretary of the Navy Del Toro said in a statement today. 'It also speaks to their enduring role in projecting power globally, and most recently in the Red Sea, their proven ability to defend themselves, as well as our allies, partners and friends from missile and drone attacks.' The mention here of 'new construction warships' is particularly significant given the major delays with the Constellation class frigate program, which you can read about in more detail here. The first of those frigates may now not enter service until 2029, nearly a decade after the award of the initial production contract. A true successor to the Arleigh Burke class, currently referred to as DDG(X), is still far off on the horizon, as well. As it stands now, the Navy is not expecting the construction of the first of these new warships to even start until 2032. A graphic from 2022 depicting a notional DDG(X) design and its features. USN On top of all of this, concerns about at best relatively flat defense budgets in the coming years have been increasingly sending shockwaves across the entire U.S. military and forcing serious rethinking of even top-priority modernization efforts. Future shipbuilding plans, which can be costly and require significant lead time under the best circumstances, could easily be impacted. There have been serious questions about overall U.S. shipyard capacity for new production naval vessels, as well as repair work, for years now. The Navy has been looking at ways to rectify these deficiencies, including through the use of foreign companies. An Office of Naval Intelligence briefing slide from circa 2023 comparing U.S. and Chinese shipbuilding capacity. USN USN 'Today’s budget constrained environment requires the Navy to make prioritized investments to keep more ready players on the field,' Navy Adm. Lisa Franchetti, Chief of Naval Operations, the service's top uniformed office, said in a statement today around the Flight I Burke life extension announcement. 'The Navy is actively pulling the right levers to maintain and grow its Battle Force Inventory to support the United States’s global interests in peace and to win decisively in conflict.' Franchetti rolled out a new 'navigation plan,' also known as Project 33, for her service earlier this year that prominently included a call to get to a place by 2027 where it would be possible to surge deploy 80 percent of all naval vessels and combat aircraft, and do so relatively quickly, if necessary. This would represent a huge increase over current readiness rates and it remains to be seen if the Navy will be able to get anywhere near that goal in the next three years. 'We are shooting for very high, very tough stretch goals here, and I know that, but the only way we’re going to get there [is] if you set those goals that high,' Franchetti said in September. 'That is what we need to do.' The decision now to keep more Flight I Arleigh Burkes in service through the 2028-2035 timeline will at least help the Navy keep its total warship inventory up as it tries to meet its broader and highly ambitious goals.

Cause Of Fire At UK’s Critical Nuclear Submarine Shipyard Still U...	A blaze has ripped through the BAE Systems’ nuclear submarine shipyard in Cumbria, England, a unique facility of major strategic importance where the U.K. Royal Navy’s Astute class nuclear-powered fast attack submarines and Dreadnought class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines are being built. While the cause of the fire is yet to be determined, it comes at a time of increasing concern about Russian-inspired sabotage activities across Europe. The 'significant' fire at the Devonshire Dock Hall (DDH) building, at BAE Systems’ complex in Barrow-in-Furness, in the northeast of England, started overnight. Three Astute class submarines under construction at BAE Systems’ Devonshire Dock Hall located in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, England. BAE Systems Footage posted to social media shows long flames reaching into the sky and smoke billowing above the DDH building, one of the largest of its kind in Europe. A woman living nearby, Donna Butler, 36, said: 'My son came and got me and said that the BAE alarms were going off, so we went. When I opened the front door, we just saw a lot of black smoke. It was a lot of black smoke, like really thick black smoke, and it was very loud.' At the time of the incident, around 200 people were working on the night shift.

Two colleagues were taken to hospital having suffered suspected smoke inhalation and have both since been released.' 'At this time there are no other casualties and everyone else has been evacuated from the Devonshire Dock Hall and are accounted for,' the police said. Although residents of the local area were told to stay indoors, the police said there was no radiation risk associated with the blaze. The police later said that residents should keep doors and windows closed, likely due to the risk of particles, especially from metals and other construction materials. At this stage, the cause of the fire is unclear, although different naval sources and investigators have so far sought to play down the possibility that it might have been started deliberately. A U.K. Ministry of Defense spokesperson said it was working closely with both BAE Systems and the emergency services and added: 'We would like to thank the emergency services for their swift response and wish those who have required hospital treatment a quick recovery.' The Cumbrian fire and rescue service also said an investigation into the cause of the fire was underway. In the meantime, BAE Systems confirmed that work is continuing as normal elsewhere at the facility. Reports suggest that, at the time of the incident, the nuclear-powered attack submarine (SSN) HMS Agincourt was in the DDH building, where it is being completed as the last of the seven-strong Astute class.

The completion of the boat is expected in 2026. Once the Astute class attack submarines are completed, the DDH building will be the center of production for the new Dreadnought class SSBNs. The Dreadnought class is scheduled to enter service starting in the early 2030s at a total estimated cost of around $43 billion. Armed with Trident submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), the Dreadnoughts will replace a similar number of Vanguard class SSBNs now in Royal Navy service.

The first of these is planned to be delivered to the United Kingdom by the late 2030s, with the initial example for Australia being handed over in the early 2040s.

U.K. Ministry of Defense illustration As of today, non-essential staff working at the DDH building have been told to work from home on Wednesday and there is a report from the BBC that staff who did arrive at the site were confused as to which parts of the site were still accessible. The DDH building is 167 feet tall and has internal working dimensions of 850 feet by 190 feet, providing a total area of 270,000 square feet. Built in the first half of the 1980s, the building provides a fully protected working environment for nuclear submarine construction, without the need for slipways, and it also keeps sensitive construction activities hidden from intelligence-gathering satellites. Only last month, plans were submitted for the further development of the site, with a new facility to be built, to serve as a pre-paint outfitting facility.

SteveMi/Wikicommons At this early stage, there is nothing to point to the blaze having been started deliberately, but the current security situation in Europe should also be considered. There has been a recent spike in reports of sabotage at various military and defense-related installations across Europe. Some of these have been confirmed as being deliberate, while others have ultimately proven to be false alarms. In April, for example, one of Norway’s most strategic air bases had a critical communications cable severed, with local police confirming this was deliberate.

Photo by Roberto Pfeil/picture alliance via Getty Images All these incidents come amid increasing warnings about nefarious Russian activity on the continent, part of an apparent wave of ‘hybrid warfare’ as East-West tensions continue to build, ramped up by the war in Ukraine. Earlier this year, two German-Russian nationals were arrested in Germany on suspicion of plotting bomb and arson attacks, including on U.S. military facilities in the country, underscoring the reality of the threat. Whatever the cause of the fire at the nuclear submarine shipyard in the United Kingdom, it’s a stark reminder of the potential vulnerability of critical military infrastructure, all the more relevant as NATO prepares itself for what is expected to be an expanding campaign of sabotage across Europe, a new wave of hybrid warfare masterminded by Russia. As for the Devonshire Dock Hall, this is a gigantic and strategic facility for the United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defense and the industry it depends on and is vital for the future of the country’s strategic deterrent and submarine programs. Any kind of longer-term disruption to its activities will be keenly felt.

How The Army Will Use Its Super Integrated Air Defense System	Developed in partnership with Northrop Grumman, the Integrated Battle Command System, or IBCS, is the beating heart of the U.S. Army’s future air and missile defense architecture. Calling IBCS transformative is an understatement – its capabilities have the potential to totally transform how the U.S. Army defends the skies, enhancing both legacy and new weapons systems. Northrop Grumman’s William 'Bill' Lamb, a former U.S. Army air defense officer, acquisition official, and now the company’s operating unit director of Global Mission Command and Control, sat down to give us an expansive inside look at the latest IBCS developments, explaining how the system works and about its evolving capabilities. But first, a quick overview of IBCS and why it’s so critical to the Army’s future ability to modernize air and missile defense. What is IBCS? The IBCS command and control system is designed from the ground-up to deal with the complexities of the modern battlespace, where warfighters must sift through critical data and make rapid engagement decisions. This system networks with current and future sensors and weapons platforms – regardless of source, service, or domain – to create an integrated fire control network that identifies and engages air and missile threats. Its modular, open and scalable architecture allows users a sensor-fused, highly accurate, rapidly actionable ‘picture’ of the full battlespace. IBCS tackles evolving air and missile threats, from incoming drone swarms to hypersonic weapons, while creating a ‘any sensor, best shooter’ strategy. This enables operators to select the optimal effector for the situation. Since 2015, the IBCS program has successfully executed multiple developmental and operational flight tests under increasingly realistic conditions, including early engineering to integrate the U.S. Navy’s Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) to the IBCS Integrated Fire Control Network (IFCN). The joint multi-domain command-and-control provided by IBCS, along with its data integration and distribution capabilities, make it a pillar of the U.S. Department of Defense’s Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) vision. IBCS’s capability to fuse data from joint service sensors to create and distribute a single integrated air picture is particularly key. Follow-on operational test and evaluation (FOT&E) of IBCS is planned for 2025, before deployment to active-duty Army units. A configured IBCS station. U.S. Army TWZ: IBCS pulls in a multitude of information, forms a common picture, neutralizes multiple threats. Can you walk us through its design and capabilities? Lamb: Let me start off with a description of the threat and how it's continuing to evolve, because that lays the groundwork for how IBCS is designed and why it's designed the way it is. Today’s battlespace is complex, ranging from ground-based threats like rockets, mortars, and artillery, collectively called RAM, to low-flying fast attack aircraft and cruise missiles that employ terrain avoidance and maneuver to avoid detection. We’re also seeing the prolific employment of drones, as seen in Ukraine, posing new challenges in countering drone swarms. You also have ballistic missiles that are flying inside and outside of the atmosphere, and then increasingly there’s the threat from very fast hypersonic missiles. The challenge lies in detecting and optimally engaging these diverse threats with all available defense systems. Over the years, the U.S. Army has made significant investments in systems like Patriot, which is a medium-range air defense system, and THAAD, which is a system for intercepting short, medium, and intermediate-range ballistic missiles. These systems were traditionally designed to be tightly coupled between the command-and-control [C2], the sensors, and the effectors, making interoperability with other systems very difficult. IBCS’s big idea is a network-enabled, Modular Open System Approach [MOSA]-designed command-and-control architecture, which essentially componentizes systems like Patriot. Meaning you remove the command and control – and then adapt the sensor [the Patriot radar] and adapt the launcher effector onto an integrated fire-control network. The IBCS architecture integrates various sensors and effectors into a unified network. It is capable of collecting data from across the domains of ground, air, maritime, and space, to create a single integrated air picture that identifies all inbound threats. An IBCS Engagement Operations Center is unloaded from a C-5 Galaxy transport aircraft. U.S. Army TWZ: Just to follow up on that, around the small unmanned aerial system (UAS) threat and the means to defeat that, is it something that can easily be added to IBCS? Lamb: The architecture absolutely supports this level of integration. To be clear, it's not currently a capability that IBCS features, but the Army plans to integrate all of its available sensors and effector systems onto this single fire-control network over time. For example, FAAD C2 [Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control] is a Northrop Grumman system that’s in the Army inventory and is deployed for short-range air defense in U.S. Army divisions is not yet fully integrated with IBCS, but the Army plan is to migrate that capability such that Army Air Defense Forces operate and employ IBCS as a single C2 system. That command-and-control capability for engaging small UAS' resides within FAAD C2, and it’s not currently resident in IBCS but it will come under IBCS and FAAD C2 convergence. One of the really powerful aspects of IBCS is that once fully fielded to the Army, new soldiers entering the service will be trained on the system and will be able to go their entire career and not have to retrain on other air and missile defense systems because IBCS will be the single C2 system for Army air missile defense. I would add that there's still work that the Army has to do surrounding integration of sensors for that short-range air defense mission and the counter-UAS mission. If you have a drone inbound that you've acquired and detected with a sensor, you don't want to shoot that $500 drone down with a multi-million dollar Patriot interceptor, it needs an effect that’s more tailored to that threat. There is a lot of work being done with lasers and RF [Radiofrequency] energy to defeat those kinds of threats more economically. TWZ: Is IBCS able to link with other systems, like the SM-6 medium-range missile? Lamb: On Northrop Grumman investment, we are currently working with Raytheon on the engineering to integrate the SM-6 with IBCS and have successfully demonstrated simulated engagements during tests and exercises. The Army’s Medium Range Capability (MRC) program incorporates the SM-6 missile for strike. The IBCS open systems architecture is designed to be scalable and extensible, such that with additional development and investment it could perform both defensive and offensive missions. We are continuing to invest in research and development to explore these adjacent missions. TWZ: How does IBCS work, what is the basic layout, and how does it link to other systems and have them on its network? Lamb: There are essentially three major equipment items in IBCS. There’s the Engagement Operations Center [EOC], which you can think of as a shelter that mounts on the back of a five-ton truck and it's got an antenna mast and has the communications onboard. The EOC is where the soldiers plan and fight the battle. This remotes into something that we call the Integrative Collaborative Environment [ICE], which is essentially a standard Army AirBeam tent. The ICE is where soldiers plan and fight the air battle. IBCS provides for remoting up to 10 operator workstations into the ICE. Within the EOC, you have two operator workstations which affords the capability for operators to employ and fight the system while the ICE is being established. Inside an IBCS Integrative Collaborative Environment. U.S. Army The Army plans to deploy IBCS with six EOCs in a battalion and 12 mobile fire control network relays. The IFCN relay forms the network and serves as the interface point for adapting sensors and weapons to the network. The Army's force structure provides for 12 per battalion that are distributed across the battlefield. Each fire control network relay has a large 30-meter antenna mast, radios, and computing power. The network architecture is resilient and robust. It is designed such that every EOC on the network maintains the same air picture, and so if you lose one or more of the EOCs on the network, you can continue to fight the battle. Today, with a standard U.S. Army Patriot, if you lose the Engagement Control Station at the battery level, then that battery is out of action. So culturally, this is a big change. Patriot was designed in the 1970s and was fielded in the 1980s, so employment thinking is still dominated by experience with Patriot. IBCS genuinely changes the paradigm for deploying whole battalions through its network architecture design that enables tailoring to enable employment of air and missile defense task forces. This means that rather than deploying a complete Patriot battalion, a commander could deploy a task force encompassing multiple types of sensors and effectors tailored for a specific mission. This provides commanders with a high degree of operational flexibility. It’s also worth underlining the power of this open systems architecture. Traditionally, to perform a PAC-3 missile engagement, the uplink to the missile has to be performed through the radar. That’s very limiting because it means you have to deploy launchers in a position where they're in proximity to the radar to be able to affect that uplink. This means you’re effectively constraining the range of the missile and the battlespace for performing engagements. The Army has developed a capability called Remote Interceptor Guidance 360, or RIG-360, which is essentially an antenna uplink device that can be positioned at various locations on the battlefield. It removed the need to physically tether launchers and effectors to the location of the radar, so it’s an additional decoupling and dependency from a sensor. To give you a sense of how powerful that is, in a U.S. Army test at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, in November 2023, the Army employed a cruise missile surrogate target against a test architecture encompassing IBCS integrated with three Sentinel short-range surveillance radars, a PAC-3 launcher and missile, and RIG-360. The Sentinel radar was not designed to work with the Patriot system but has been integrated with IBCS. It is important to note that there was no Patriot radar in the architecture to support the engagement. IBCS leveraged the data from the three Sentinel radars to develop the fire-control solution to perform a successful PAC-3 missile intercept of the cruise missile with an uplink from the RIG-360. That’s really powerful. Northrop Grumman's connected battlespace, where all domains, services, and coalition partners engage together. Northrop Grumman TWZ: How does IBCS connect and share data with other C2 systems to form an even larger network?. Lamb: IBCS is designed to communicate with other platforms and command-and control systems across a number of data links to include Link 16 datalink and MADL [Multifunction Advanced Data Link]. In flight testing, IBCS has demonstrated the capability to integrate with F-35. In addition, one of the engineering initiatives the Army has pursued with the Missile Defense Agency, and which we have supported, is a bridging technology known as the Joint Track Management Capability, or JTMC bridge. The U.S. Navy has a very similar kind of system like IBCS called Cooperative Engagement Capability [CEC]. CEC takes data from multiple platforms, such as SPY-6 radar on AEGIS-class ships, E-2D Hawkeye, U.S. Marine Corps’ G/ATOR radar [AN/TPS-80 Ground/Air Task-Oriented Radar], and and integrates the data to create a high-fidelity quality track that is distributed across the network. The bridge enables the passing of data back and forth between the two networks to create a single integrated air picture. TWZ: How does IBCS physically connect to the distributed systems at long ranges, and how might it plug into JADC2 in the future? Lamb: IBCS is capable of being connected over long distances via fiber optics and satellite communications. We’ve demonstrated its ability to link with airborne platforms and sensors across various domains, with data displayed in command centers thousands of miles away. JADC2 is aimed at joint force integration, and IBCS is the Army’s contribution to this vision. Operators at work inside an IBCS Integrative Collaborative Environment. U.S. Army Darrell Ames TWZ: IBCS is Poland’s choice for its NAREW short-range air defense program and phase two of the WISŁA medium-range air defense program, which provides one of the most potent air and missile defense capabilities in Europe, as well as interoperability with U.S. forces. Are you seeing more international interest in IBCS? Lamb: Global conflicts are fueling recognition for the need to meet the increasing complexity of the air and ballistic missile threat and the need to defeat drones and other new, emerging threats. When you think of all the countries that have acquired the venerable U.S. Patriot system, which is up to around 19 nations now including the U.S., the way that this system can be upgraded is through the acquisition of the latest PAC-3 missile, or with IBCS as the command-and-control system. We are seeing significant interest in IBCS from allies and partners that have acquired and employ Patriot within their armed forces. We’re also working with Diehl Defence in Germany on the IRIS-T SLM. We can integrate with Germany’s legacy command-and-control system and with IRIS-T, and, and then obviously with Patriot that they also operate. Poland was an early adopter of IBCS. They made a decision to acquire it in 2017 and we were on contract in 2019 as part of a project for IBCS and Patriot, and we're fully delivered. We anticipate that they'll declare Initial Operational Capability for IBCS this year. In February 2024, they also decided to acquire IBCS for their short-range air defense program and they are buying the MBDA CAMM [Common Anti-air Modular Missile] missile system for that mission. We completed some work with MBDA a few years ago performing prototype integration of IBCS with CAMM. Overall, Poland is a large acquisition, targeting five squadrons of IBCS and Patriot for WISŁA and something on the order of 23 batteries for their NAREW short-range air defense system, equating to the largest air missile defense force within NATO when it’s fully delivered. Poland recognized the transformational capability of network-enabled open systems architecture that IBCS affords. Low-Rate Initial Production major end items for IBCS. Northrop Grumman TWZ: Can you provide an update on the overall status of the IBCS program? Lamb: We have been delivering low-rate initial production MEIs [major end items] since December 2023, and they are manufactured at our Huntsville manufacturing facility. We were just placed on contract a few months ago for full rate production and we're in the process of developing the proposal for a production program in 2025 as part of the Army’s annual procurement of IBCS. The LRIP MEIs will be fielded initially to a U.S. Army battalion that is designated to support U.S. Army testing of IBCS and other systems in development. Fielding to the U.S. Army Air Defense Artillery School at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, is planned for 2025 as is the start of fielding of the three IBCS battalions to the active force. Follow-on test and evaluation [FOT&E] is planned for the summer of 2025. That will be a full blown operational test incorporating the same testing methodology used during initial operational test and evaluation in 2022. They test a fully-trained IBCS unit that can employ and maintain the system, and that is trained on the tactics, techniques, and procedures to use it. It includes live air testing and integrated flight tests. The Army is also increasing their research and development [R&D] investment in their 2025 budget submission. That’s unusual for a major defense program like IBCS to be approved for production and then see R&D investment go up, and this is because of the additional systems and capabilities that the Army wants to integrate. For example, over the last year or so we've been integrating the Army's Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor, known as LTAMDS. The Army also has plans to integrate the latest Sentinel A4 radar, and it announced plans to integrate THAAD [Terminal High-Altitude Air Defense]. There’s also a budget for deeper integration of the F-35 fighter as well as with passive sensors. IBCS is a revolutionary command-and-control system that unifies current and future systems regardless of source, service, or domain. Through its network-enabled, modular, open and scalable architecture, IBCS gives warfighters capabilities they never had before by fusing sensor data for a single actionable picture of the full battlespace. This ready-now capability gives warfighters more time to make decisions on how best to defeat threats and is a foundational element for enabling joint and coalition, multi-domain operations.

Israeli F-16I Shown Loaded-Up With Four Rampage Stand-Off Missile...	The Israeli Air Force (IAF) has released a rare picture of an F-16I fighter armed with four Rampage missiles, an adaptation of a ground-launched precision-guided artillery rocket. The image was used to with an announcement about Israel's killing of Mustafa Ahmad Shahdi, a top Hezbollah commander, though it is unclear if Rampages were used to deliver that strike. Rampage is part of a growing arsenal of Israeli air-launched ballistic missiles and other similar aerial munitions, the significance of which has come into sharp relief this year, especially in recent retaliatory strikes on targets in Iran. 'ELIMINATED: Deputy Commander of Hezbollah’s Radwan Forces, Mustafa Ahmad Shahdi,' an IAF social media post accompanying the picture reads. 'Shahdi advanced numerous terrorist attacks against Israel and oversaw attacks against IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers in southern Lebanon.'

He was also previously responsible for the Radwan Forces' operations during… pic.twitter.com/kAalSpxmFX&mdash; Israeli Air Force (@IAFsite) October 30, 2024 Hezbollah's Radwan Force is typically described as the Lebanese terrorist group's most elite formation and has been employed to conduct various highly specialized missions over the years, including infiltrations into Israeli territory. The IDF has dramatically stepped up operations targeting Hezbollah's top leadership, as well as attacks on more rank-and-file members and its missile and other capabilities, since September. This includes the killing of Hassan Nasrallah, the long-time head of Hezbollah, and the group's number two official Hashem Safieddine. Naim Qassem, previously Hezbollah Deputy Secretary General, was just named as its new leader this week. 'He [Shahdi] was also previously responsible for the Radwan Forces' operations during combat in Syria in 2012-2017,' the IAF social media post continues. 'Eliminating Shahdi is part of the effort to degrade Hezbollah’s Radwan Forces' capabilities to direct and execute terrorist activities against IDF troops and communities in the northern border, in particular the 'Conquer the Galilee' plan.' The post does not explicitly say that Rampage-armed F-16Is were used to strike Shahdi, who was reportedly targeted near the city of Nabatieh in southern Lebanon, which sits around 20 miles north of the border with Israel. It would seem curious for a relatively advanced standoff munition to have been employed against a target relatively close by above which Israeli aircraft operate over regularly. Still, since it first emerged publicly in 2018, the Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) missile has been pitched as an ideal tool for carrying out short-notice strikes on time-sensitive and well defended high-value targets, and doing so with significant stand-off range, reducing risks to the launching aircraft. The weapon's supersonic speed presents challenges for any air defenses attempting to intercept it, as well. That could also help them burrow deeper into hardened targets. It's worth noting here that IAI does not explicitly define Rampage as an air-launched ballistic missile. However, the line between large-caliber guided artillery rockets like the one Rampage is derived from, which do follow ballistic trajectories to their targets, and what are more traditionally considered short-range ballistic missiles (SRBM) is increasingly blurry. The U.S. military notably includes guided artillery rockets with diameters as small as 122mm in its current definition of close-range ballistic missiles (CRBM), a subset of SRBMs with ranges under 186 miles (300 kilometers). Beyond Israel, India is also known to have purchased Rampages and there have been reports that Greece is looking to do so, as well. Whether or not Rampages were used to strike Hezbollah's Shahdi, the importance of it and other air-launched ballistic missiles in Israel's inventory cannot be understated. At least three other aeroballistic missiles have been identified as being available to the IAF now, including the Rafael Rocks and the IAI Air LORA. A recently leaked U.S. intelligence document mentioned an Israeli air-launched ballistic missile called Golden Horizon, as well as Rocks, but provided no details. An IAF F-16I wearing a rare gray scheme carrying a Rocks air-launched ballistic missile. This is the only known image of Rocks. IAF Air-launched ballistic missiles were used in Israel's strikes against Iran in April and there is visual evidence of this from debris recovered in Iraq afterward. The wreckage also pointed to the weapons being fired from well outside of Iranian airspace, underscoring the aforementioned stand-off range benefits that weapons like Rampage, Rocks, and Air LORA offer. That range is doubly important for Israel, which has limited aerial refueling capabilities that it can use to extend the combat radius of launch platforms like the F-16I. It also allows for attacking highly defended targets at distance without major support packages traditional required to enable those kinds of strikes as well as all the risk of executing such an operation inside hostile airspace. Compared to cruise missiles, air-launched ballistic missiles are more survivable in many circumstances and hit much harder.

Evidence of their use has again emerged from debris subsequently found in Iraq.

A picture of an F-16 that the IAF released after its October 2024 strikes on Iran. IAF Altogether, Israel's employment of an increasingly diverse array of air-launched ballistic missiles only looks set to grow and we could get more glimpses of these capabilities as a result.

Battle-Proven NASAMS Air Defense Systems Approved For Taiwan	Taiwan is lining up to become the next customer for the combat-proven National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS) air defense system after the United States approved its sale to the country. The introduction of the system would be a considerable boost to Taiwan as it seeks to bolster its air defenses in the face of the growing and increasingly advanced nature of the threat posed by Chinese aircraft, missiles, and drones. As is typically the case for major U.S. arms sales, the Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) announced the State Department’s approval of the NASAMS package for Taiwan last week. The possible Foreign Military Sale could be valued at up to $1.16 billion. The proposed deal consists of three NASAMS systems, each of which includes an AN/MPQ-64F1 Sentinel radar. Other related hardware comprises an undisclosed number of fire distribution centers (FDC), canister launcher systems (CLS), electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) systems, and tactical control center (TCC) systems. The systems will be provided with up to 123 AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles-Extended Range (AMRAAM-ER). Designed specifically for NASAMS, the AMRAAM-ER combines elements of the RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) and newer versions of the AIM-120 AMRAAM. The resulting missile offers a significant boost in maximum range and engagement altitude over a standard AIM-120 fired from a NASAMS launcher. You can read more about the AMRAAM-ER and its capabilities here. Armed with standard AMRAAMs, NASAMS is capable of engaging targets from relatively close ranges to up to roughly 20 miles away and from around 1,000 feet to 50,000 feet, making it notably flexible. Leveraging the ESSM’s motor and control section reportedly increases the engagement range by about 50 percent and increases the ceiling by 70 percent. AMRAAM-ER undergoing wind tunnel testing. Raytheon However, NASAMS can also fire other missiles, too, as we will discuss in a moment. Related equipment in the package includes Multifunctional Information Distribution Systems (MIDS) and MIDS Link 16-capable radios, radar communication nodes, IPS-250X High Assurance Internet Protocol Encryptions (HAIPE), KIV-77 identification friend-or-foe (IFF) systems; AN/PSN-13 Defense Advanced Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers (DAGR), and more. It should be noted that approved foreign arms sales announced through DSCA are not final and are subject to change, including as a result of negotiations between the country in question and relevant defense contractors. According to a statement from the DSCA, 'The proposed sale will improve the recipient’s capability to meet current and future threats by contributing to the recipient’s abilities to defend its airspace, provide regional security, and increase interoperability with the United States through its NASAMS program.' AMRAAM-ER undergoing a test firing from a NASAMS box launcher. Kongsberg 'This proposed sale serves U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient’s continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability. The proposed sale will help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance, and economic progress in the region,' the DSCA adds. As we have examined in the past, in relation to the transfer of NASAMS to Ukraine, this is a medium-range air defense system that can engage a variety of aerial threats. The system is especially useful for intercepting cruise missiles and one-way attack drones, weapons that China would use if it were to conduct strikes against targets in Taiwan. It also has a very limited capability against short-range ballistic missiles under certain circumstances. NASAMS has a modular architecture that allows for the use of a number of different radars and other sensors, as well as launchers, in a single battery, depending on the variant, all tied to a central fire distribution center. The system can be integrated into a larger integrated air defense system (IADS) consisting of disparate sensors and weapons, which is especially useful for Taiwan and its demanding requirements vis-à-vis the Chinese threat. Another huge advantage of NASAMS, and one we have discussed in great detail before, is its ability to fire ubiquitous AMRAAMs. A NASAMS launcher firing an AMRAAM-ER missile. Raytheon In fact, the primary armament for NASAMS is the exact same AIM-120 AMRAAMs used around the world by fighter aircraft in air-to-air applications. There is no requirement for a special AMRAAM variant or major modifications to existing missiles. In this way, Taiwan’s NASAMS can also be provided with ‘effectors’ direct from the existing stocks of missiles used by Republic of China Air Force (ROCAF) F-16 fighters. In addition, NASAMS is able to fire infrared-homing AIM-9X Sidewinder and IRIS-T missiles, the former of which is also used by the ROCAF’s upgraded F-16V fighters.

Photo by SAM YEH/AFP via Getty Images SAM YEH While the ability to use missiles from existing stocks in NASAMS is clearly a big advantage for Taiwan, it should also be noted that there have been concerns in the past that the number of AMRAAMs available to the ROCAF is much too small to offer resilience in any kind of protracted conflict with China. According to reports, the ROCAF has around 300-400 AMRAAMs to arm its F-16s, insufficient to counter the huge Chinese aerial threat. With a fleet of around 140 F-16s, this would provide for just over two missiles per aircraft. In times of particular tension, therefore, Taiwan would be expected to place emergency orders with the United States for more AMRAAMs and other critical munitions. But could those weapons even reach Taiwan in time if a major conflict were to erupt?

The first batch of AIM-120C-5s had been delivered by late 2003, with another sale of AIM-120C-7s being approved in 2007. Should China and Taiwan go to war, there exists the possibility, at least, to feed the NASAMS using a vast global stockpile of AMRAAMs to support the kind of high-intensity conflict that this would involve. NASAMS is far from a total solution for Taiwan, especially with just three systems currently in the country’s sights. Once procured, it will form part of a multi-layered integrated air defense system that is an absolutely fundamental component of Taiwan’s ability to defend against an aerial attack from China should Beijing ever go on the offensive against the island, which it sees as a breakaway province. A Taiwanese F-16 fighter shadows a cruise-missile-carrying PLA Air Force H-6K bomber that had approached the island of Taiwan. Military News Agency, ROC Among the key Chinese threats that NASAMS could help defend against are land-attack cruise missiles, which could be launched from bombers, submarines, and surface combatants, as well as from ground-based launchers. They would likely be used to try and knock out Taiwanese air bases and other key military infrastructure across the island. Then there is the growing threat posed by Chinese drones. These are increasingly being tested in swarms, which would be a huge challenge for Taiwan’s defenses. As well as being used for one-way attack missions, drones would likely also be used for surveillance missions, locating targets for stand-off strikes, as well as employing electronic warfare jammers, or even systems able to launch cyber attacks to confuse and overwhelm the island’s defenses, or simply harass Taiwanese forces.

The Tien Kung I has a maximum range of 63 miles and can only engage aircraft targets but can be deployed in vertical-launch silos at fixed sites and on mobile trailer launchers. The Tien Kung II offers around twice the range and can also engage cruise missiles but is only deployed in silos. Finally, the Tien Kung III has a reported range of 125 miles and is primarily an anti-ballistic missile (ABM) system, broadly equivalent to the U.S.-made Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system. Taiwan also operates U.S.-supplied Patriot Advanced Capability 2 and 3 (PAC-2 and PAC-3) systems, which provide additional ABM capabilities and long-range air defense against a broad range of threats.

SAM YEH/AFP via Getty Images SAM YEH Most likely, Taiwan’s NASAMS would be deployed around major population centers to provide area air defense in the most critical areas. In particular, it would be expected to offer improved defense against low-flying cruise missiles and drones, which are challenging targets to reliably intercept. Ultimately, the mix of capabilities and advantages that NASAMS offers may well see it go on to become a more fundamental cornerstone of Taiwan’s integrated air defense system, which faces an enormous challenge in terms of the number and variety of threats it faces.

Here’s What NORAD’s Commander Just Told Us About The Langley AFB ...	The incursions of mystery drones over Langley Air Force Base in Virginia - which we were the first to report back in March - has sparked a lot of questions about who flew them and how the U.S. military responded to them and will do so in similar instances in the future. Drone flights over sensitive military installations, warning areas, naval warships, and critical national infrastructure sites is a major issue The War Zone has raised for years. Today we had a chance to ask the general responsible for defending America's airspace about the issue and the Langley incursions, in particular. Speaking to The War Zone along with a small group of reporters at Peterson Space Force Base in Colorado Springs, the commander of U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) and the joint U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) Air Force Gen. Gregory M. Guillot offered few specifics about the incursions but talked about some of the steps NORAD is taking in the wake of those incidents. A satellite image of Langley Air Force Base. Google Earth 'The only thing I can tell you about the Langley drones is roughly the number and roughly the altitude,' he said when we asked him about the exact characteristics and configurations of those drones. He did not elaborate. However, earlier this month, Air Force Gen. Mark Kelly told The Wall Street Journal that at least one of the drones was 'roughly 20 feet long and flying at more than 100 miles an hour, at an altitude of roughly 3,000 to 4,000 feet. Other drones followed, one by one, sounding in the distance like a parade of lawn mowers.' Replying to our question, Guillot told us he did not know if they were tracked back to their recovery point or whether they could have been launched by a vessel off the coast. The Langley incursions were among more than 600 reported over U.S. military installations since 2022, NORAD stated Tuesday. In the wake of the rash of drone activity over Langley AFB, NORAD was tasked by the Joint Chiefs of Staff to look at drone incursions across the U.S., Guillot said. 'I saw that NORAD’s responsibility for countering UAS was very limited to something that would be an attack of national consequence,' he explained not the small drones as seen over Langley and elsewhere. NORTHCOM, meanwhile, has no responsibility or authority to take action, because the services are charged with securing their facilities. As part of his assessment, Guillot examined the defensive capabilities Langley had at the time, what was brought in, 'and then how could they operate in that system.' That led to the creation of a counter-drone experiment this week called Falcon Peak 2025, in which several companies will offer their solutions to counter these incursions. We will go into more detail on these possible solutions after we see some of the systems in use on Wednesday. After taking the reins at both commands in February, Guillot initiated a 90-day assessment of what role they could play in dealing with the kind of small drones that flew over Langley, That situation formed the centerpiece of his assessment, he testified before Congress in March. Air Force Gen. Gregory M. Guillot, commander, U.S. Northern Command and North American Aerospace Defense Command, testifies during the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on the Review of the Defense Authorization Request for Fiscal Year 2025 and the Future Years Defense Program. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) Tom Williams One finding he talked about Tuesday was that NORAD should coordinate the military and government’s response to small drone incursions. 'I want to make sure that we have a solid foundation for the DOD and the interagency, and I also want to put an umbrella over the top where someone's looking out to share best practices and ensure machine-to-machine linkage, so we can share that type of information,' Guillot remarked. In addition, he wants to 'work with industry to make sure that we're building the right kind of systems that we need to defeat the threats that we're seeing, not only now, but expect to see into the future.' Guillot said that he 'coordinates frequently' with the recently formed All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), the Pentagon’s unit tracking what used to be known as UFOs. In addition, he remains confident that the incursions reported over installations are small drones as opposed to something that can't be identified. As we have frequently reported, there have been unidentified drone incursions for years over U.S. military installations, warning areas, and critical government facilities. Among them were a very similar repeated rashes of claimed drone sightings in Colorado in 2020 in an area where many of America’s ICBMs are based. Another took place at the Palo Verde nuclear facility in Arizona in 2019. Also in 2019, drones swarmed over a U.S. Navy exercise taking place 100 miles off the coast of California, raising concerns that an adversary was trying to suck up critical intelligence, including very sensitive electronic and signals emissions of America's most advanced air defense and command and control systems. The Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Paul Hamilton had a series of encounters with unidentified drones off the coast of southern California in 2019. USN More recently, we were the first to write about drone flights over the highly-secure Plant 42 in Palmdale California that were so concerning a temporary flight restriction was issued for the airspace over the facility. Asked about why the military is taking this matter more seriously now, Guillot suggested the reason is technology-based. 'We have more systems that can detect and track them with fidelity that shows the range and altitude that they are near either critical infrastructure or a base.' Guillot did acknowledge systems have been in place to detect and track objects for years and that there were lessons learned from the Chinese surveillance balloon that passed over parts of the United States and Canada in February 2023 before being shot down 'For years, we've had clutter reduction capabilities, moving target indicators that can find something moving in clutter that's very important to us,' he told another reporter at the roundtable. 'And I think, as we saw with the balloon, what the clutter gate is, you know, so you could reduce anything below a certain speed, where we have that set, and then, the elevation, how high we look, is certainly something that I think we've learned over the last several years.' You can read more about NORAD's admission that its radars were not properly configured to spot and track non-traditional aircraft following the Chinese balloon incident here and here. While he expressed confidence in the ability to detect and track larger drones and crewed aircraft, Guillot said there is a need to improve those capabilities for smaller ones. '&#8230;the purpose of this demonstration is to improve our ability to detect and track the Group One and Group Twos, which are much smaller, fly lower, which puts them in that clutter range&#8230; ' We also asked about whether the U.S. is still considering installing surface-to-air missile defense systems around military installations and critical locales (beyond Washington D.C.) and whether the umbrella provided almost entirely by a relatively small cadre on-alert fighter aircraft is still the best way to protect American skies. The 142nd Fighter Wing is one of the world’s premier air F-15 Eagle units. USAF An F-15C from the 142nd Fighter Wing. USAF The military has to take a 'layered approach' because the 'threat is layered,' Guillot enunciated. 'I think there's certainly a role for fighters. There's a role for non-kinetic or low-collateral kinetic capabilities that would be at the smaller end. And then I'm a big proponent for advances in directed energy, laser and high power microwave. So those non-kinetic capabilities that bring a kinetic result of bringing down the systems, and I think it has to be layered in today's today's threat.' 'The challenge that we see today is that it's not a single competitor or adversary that threatens us,' Guillot added. 'It's not a single domain that threatens us, and it's not a single avenue approach. So the only way to get after multiple potential adversaries or competitors in all domains from all avenues of approach is to have a layered system that includes all of the things that you talked about.' Despite all the evidence that we have brought up over the years that points to foreign actors using drones to collect intelligence about U.S. military tactics, techniques, and procedures, Guillot insisted he does not know of any 'organized or unorganized foreign nexus.' He answered 'no,' when we asked him if he is seeing patterns and joint activity around military installations and in warning areas that point to a systemic and ongoing operation by an adversary. '&#8230;but that is something that we look very closely at,' he declared. 'I haven't seen it yet, but I think one of the responsibilities of this job is to always look for or assume the worst, the biggest, the most likely course of action and the most dangerous course of action. So I'm always looking for any sort of foreign nexus. But I have not seen [and] I do not know of any organized or unorganized foreign nexus.' Underscoring the myriad aerial threats his command must handle, Guillot cut the interview short and literally ran out of the room to deal with an immediate situation. The reason, we later learned, was a civilian aircraft violated temporary flight restrictions imposed over Baltimore for the visit of VIP, NORAD spokesman John Cornelio told The War Zone. It turns out the VIP was President Joe Biden. Given the damage that small weaponized drones can do and their extremely rapid proliferation, as we have seen in Ukraine, the Middle East, and even near our own borders from cartels, combatting these threats will take up an increasing amount of resources and investment. Case in point, the Air Force is now seeking extra protection for its aircraft on the ground from such attacks using shelters and other physical countermeasures, and especially at Langley AFB.

North Korea Gaining Modern Combat Experience Fighting Ukraine Is ...	Ever since the possibility of North Korea assisting Russia in its war effort emerged in the Summer of 2022, quantifying exactly what that would look like and its downstream effects have been challenging. Now, as indications point to North Korean troops wading into the direct fighting, one aspect of this major geopolitical shift beyond how it impacts Ukraine couldn't be more clear — North Korea getting real-world combat experience on a modern battlefield alongside a well-versed ally is a very unwelcome development for South Korea and the United States. The experience aspect of North Korea's involvement in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is one we have stressed repeatedly, but it's often overlooked, with the focus being more on the immediate impact an influx of troops could have for the Kremlin's cause. This is understandable as Russia has experienced heavy losses and Ukraine has as well. Any major infusion of able bodies into the fighting from an external source could erode either side's ability to compete on the battlefield. Kim inspects a group of soldiers during training. (NK State Media) KCNA Amongst notorious resource scarcity, one thing North Korea has plenty of is troops and laborers. While it is now widely understood that over 10,000 North Korean troops are preparing to fight on behalf of Russia - including some from North Korea's brutal special operations units - that could just be the start. With one of the largest standing armies on the planet and the need for cash, energy, and technological know-how for weapons development, North Korea has excess supply to offer when it comes to exporting fighting men in exchange for what it needs and wants. Add security guarantees from the world's largest nuclear power and technological assistance in advanced weapons manufacturing and it's clear that Kim Jong Un has every reason to provide Russia with whatever manpower it thinks it needs to turn the tide on the battlefield. But the fact that under such an arrangement North Korea also gets real-world combat experience is an offering Russia could not provide the Hermit Kingdom during a time of relative peace. North Korea's isolated forces could use this experience badly. North Korean special operations forces march during a parade. (PHOTO BY ED JONES / AFP via Getty Images) The last time North Korea fought substantially in an all-out modern war was nearly 75 years ago, although since then it has taken part in more limited conflicts around the globe sporadically in varying, often shadowy capacities. In addition, international training, and especially participation in advanced war games, has been extremely limited for North Korean military units, and the fidelity of the country's organic training efforts pales in comparison to those of South Korea. The massive and as 'realistic-as-possible' combat exercises South Korea executes alongside its American partners are far more advanced and actually combat representative than anything North Korea is capable of emulating. This is on top of the relatively poor standards of combat training for North Korean regular forces as a whole. So, being able to train with Russian forces and then fight in a real war with the threat of things like standoff guided weaponry, kamikaze drones, electronic warfare, night vision and thermal optics, and so much more, against a very battle-hardened enemy ground force, is arguably a priceless opportunity. The fact that the Ukrainian battlefield has direct similarities with what would exist during a war on the Peninsula is an even bigger plus.

(Photo by Jung Yeon-je / AFP) JUNG YEON-JE And yes, this means many North Koreans will die, and quite rapidly one would think, especially if Russia uses them as they have some of their conscripts and contracted forces in archaic 'meat assaults,' but in some ways that's the point. While paid for in blood, the learning curve will be very steep and likely well-documented. As brutal as it may be, lessons come quickly when they emanate from massive losses of lives on the battlefield. What North Korea learns firsthand the hard way, and from their Russian counterparts who have years of combat experience, can be incorporated into doctrine, training, and especially its weapons development endeavors, which Russia is likely assisting with, at least in some ways. Once again, sacrificing large numbers of your countrymen to get a clear view of the realities of modern combat is a very dark endeavor, but it is what it is in this case. PHOTO BY VLADIMIR SMIRNOV/POOL/AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES It remains to be seen how effective North Korean soldiers will even be and large hurdles such as language, foundational training, and equipment needs clearly exist when it comes to incorporating Pyongyang's forces into Russia's war machine. How exactly these will be overcome, especially in the near term, is unclear. It may turn out that North Korean troops are more trouble than they are worth and consume already scarce materiel and logistical support without the gains needed to justify the investment. There is also the real possibility of mass defections. But this doesn't change the benefit the North Korean army will get from combat operations regardless. Just how deep North Korea's involvement will end up being is also a huge question mark. If it is limited to what we think it is today — providing some weapons like ballistic missiles, millions of artillery shells, and around 10,000 troops — then its impact won't shift the realities of the battlefield that are already established. There are indications that, beyond small groups possibly already deployed to Ukraine, this initial cadre will be used to help boot Ukraine out of Russia's Kursk region, thus their deployment will be limited to Russia's own soil. If these troops end up being in any way effective and North Korea injects far greater numbers into the fight, not just to fight in Kursk but in Ukraine itself, it could be a massive problem for Kyiv which is struggling with holding ground as it is. Maybe just as concerning is that the impact of North Korea sending tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine would stem far beyond the reaches of Eastern Europe. North Korean troops raid a beach during training. (NK State Media) North Korea becoming a direct fighting player in this war greatly internationalizes the conflict. South Korea is already mulling jumping in with advisors and providing weaponry, the latter of which it has a large inventory of and the ability to quickly deliver more. Escalation could also come from Ukraine's allies who may see the arrival of a foreign regular fighting force in Ukraine as a reason to escalate by sending its own troops or expanding other forms of support or lifting restrictions on where and how advanced weapons can be used. But above all else, no matter how badly its troops do in combat, North Korea will walk away from this conflict with a new understanding of the demands of modern warfare from a battlefield that has similarities to the one that could erupt on the Korean Peninsula. It will exploit these lessons to the max. This, along with Russia's cash, energy, and weapons development resources, as well as intelligence, will result in a more robust, ready, and deadlier North Korean military.

Our Best Look At Taiwan’s New Drone Submarine	New imagery of Taiwan’s homegrown Huilong uncrewed underwater vehicle (UUV) — also known as the Smart Dragon — reveals more details of this intriguing craft, including what appears to be a pair of torpedo tubes, pointing to an expanded kinetic potential for the type. At this stage, it seems this relatively large drone submarine is intended as a testbed, rather than for an operational role, but its development does point to the growing ambitions of the Taiwanese Navy in terms of underwater warfare and the design, and certainly elements of it, could end up in a production form. In recent days, imagery has appeared showing the Huilong both out of the water and undergoing at-sea trials. Photos of the Huilong in a dry dock, still surrounded by scaffolding, provide a good view of the front end of the UUV, with the characteristic twin torpedo tubes at the front. Ahead of the apertures are yellow-painted cradles of the kind used to maneuver and load torpedoes and possibly torpedo-sized UUVs. A look at the rear end of the vessel, meanwhile, reveals an X-shaped rudder and tail fin arrangement, as well as a 5-bladed bladed propeller with raked tips.

Estimated specifications for the UUV include a length of around 30 meters (98 feet), a width of height of around 3.6 meters (11.8 feet), and a height of around 6 meters (19.7 feet) including the conning tower. The Huilong is thought to have a displacement of approximately 100 tons. The Huilong’s test role was reiterated in recent statements by the Taiwanese minister of defense. They said that the UUV is primarily meant for trials of sonar and underwater mines and apparently said that it doesn’t have its own propulsion system. Instead, during sea trials, it will be towed by a support vessel, the minister said. Bearing in mind the configuration of the Huilong, including propeller and tailplanes, the craft should at least have the potential to manuever under its own power, although this might only happen after initial towed trials and even then, towing it in and out of port will probably be necessary. While there has been some speculation that the Huilong might also have an operational role, there’s so far no confirmation of this. Taiwan's 'Smart Dragon' UUV is equipped with 2 torpedoes tubes. pic.twitter.com/vmeMJPjpV8&mdash; Taiwan Military (@TaiwanMilitary) October 23, 2024 More likely, it seems that technologies will be proven using the Huilong and will be ported over to follow-on UUVs, which cold include a production version of the test submarine. There are unconfirmed reports that the Huilong is intended to lead to a UUV that can be deployed from the backs of crewed submarines, although if this is possible due to its size is unclear. The design would seem to suggest it would be suitable for operating out of ports, as well. Other reports suggest that the Huilong is designed to deploy smaller UUVs, suggesting that there are ultimately plans for drone submarines that can potentially launch both torpedoes as well as UUVs that could be used for surveillance, target acquisition, and perhaps also strike operations. Laying mines is also a likely mission set. There are even conflicting accounts of whether the Huilong is a true UUV, or whether there is also provision made to carry some crew, with some reports suggesting the UUV has space for two to four people. Perhaps, a crew will be embarked in a test capacity, before moving to fully uncrewed operations. While many questions about the Huilong remain unanswered, there’s meanwhile no doubt that Taiwan is investing in its underwater capabilities. Earlier this year, TWZ reported about Taiwan’s first domestically made submarine, the Hai Kun, which entered the water for the first time in February, after being launched in September 2023. Taiwan’s first domestically made submarine, the Hai Kun (SS-711). CSBC Corporation The diesel-electric boat is the first of eight planned to provide a much-needed upgrade for Taiwan’s antiquated submarine force. While an initial assessment of the Hai Kun suggests an unusual combination of some fairly advanced features, it also potentially has a quality of finish that leaves something to be desired. The fact that Taiwan has, for many years, struggled to acquire foreign-made submarines spurred the development of the Hai Kun. But as the submarine fleet of the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) rapidly grows, the potential of UUVs to at least help address the imbalance is likely to make them an attractive option for Taiwan. In the past, Taiwanese officials have boldly stated that its new crewed submarines will be a 'strategic deterrent,' that could maintain a 'lifeline' to the Pacific in times of crisis, such as a Chinese naval blockade. That ambition seems less realistic when we take into account the fact that the PLAN submarine fleet numbers at least 60 boats, of all types, with the production of different designs and the development of new ones continuing at a rapid pace. The modern Type 039C, with its distinctive sail that is very likely intended to improve the boat’s stealthy characteristics, typifies the rapid pace of innovation in Chinese submarine design. via X While Taiwan will never be able to challenge China in terms of submarine numbers, UUVs — especially ones that can operate alongside crewed submarines — could play a very useful role. The fact is not lost on Beijing, either, with the PLAN also increasingly exploring the potential of UUVs as well as uncrewed surface vessels (USVs). Taiwan’s future submarine doctrine will be based around modern diesel-electric submarines that will likely exploit their advantages for ‘asymmetric’ warfare. This could involve setting ambushes for Chinese vessels. These same kinds of missions could potentially also be taken on by future UUVs, with torpedo-armed ones being especially suitable for ambushes. As well as launching torpedoes, the UUVs could also lay sea mines, a growing area of interest for the U.S. Navy, as well. As well as operations around Taiwan, the country’s submarine fleet could also venture further afield, including into the so-called ‘first island chain,’ where it could disrupt PLAN activities in major chokepoints like the Bashi Channel and the Miyako Strait. Again, UUVs could be of particular value here, with their small size making them proficient for shallow-water operations. A Pentagon graphic showing the geographic boundaries of the First and Second Island Chains. U.S. Department of Defense At the same time, both UUVs and crewed submarines would be prime targets for the PLAN during a conflict, in which China’s growing anti-submarine warfare capabilities would be targeting these as a matter of priority. But flooding the battespace with drones of all types is increasingly seen as a potential decisive factor in a battle across the Taiwan Strait. UUVs are definitely going to be an increasingly critical part of this tactical equation. Operational Taiwanese UUVs may still be some way off, but there’s no doubt that the country needs to urgently modernize and expand its submarine fleet. As you can read about here, this currently consists of two Hai Lung class boats, built in the Netherlands in the mid-1980s but subject to a mid-life upgrade that began in 2016. There are also two veteran Hai Shih class boats, which were originally built as Tench class and Balao class submarines during World War II, but these are understood to no longer go to sea. Faced with the threat of China’s fast-growing underwater armada, Taiwan’s interest in UUVs is understandable and it will be interesting to follow their development as it continues to upgrade its submarine force.

Ukraine Strikes Chechnya With Long-Range Drones For The First Tim...	The Kremlin-appointed Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov has vowed to avenge a Ukrainian drone attack that struck a military training facility in Chechnya. The raid, which appears to be the first of its kind to hit the southern Russian republic, is one of the longest-range drone strikes that Ukraine has attempted. The target was a special forces training center, but the attack also carries significant symbolic value, due to the high level of support of local strongman Ramzan Kadyrov for Russia’s war in Ukraine. Imagery posted to social media shows the apparent aftermath of the drone strike, on the military training academy in the town of Gudermes, 22 miles east of Grozny, the Chechen capital. As we have discussed in the past, Kadyrov was directly responsible for the creation of the Russian University of Special Forces — also known as the University of Spetsnaz — in Gudermes in 2013.

'In the very near future we’ll show them the kind of vengeance they’ve never even dreamt of,' he added. A satellite image of the Russian University of Special Forces in Gudermes. Imagery from today shows the large, boomerang-shaped building close to the center of the facility on fire. Google Earth As is typical for drone strikes of this kind, there was no immediate comment from officials in Kyiv. The privately run training academy’s glitzy website describes it as a 'professional educational institution,' that offers 'unique training grounds, methodology, and teaching staff that have no analogs in Russia.' The website features prominent testimonies from both Kadyrov and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The academy instructs both soldiers and civilians in a variety of combat tactics, including gunnery, drone operating, battlefield first aid, and parachute landing.

Russian University of Special Forces More than 47,000 troops deployed to the front line in Ukraine have been trained in Gudermes, according to the Kremlin. Meanwhile, a report from the Russian state news agency TASS claims that over 19,000 volunteers have been trained at the university before going to fight in Ukraine. Ukraine has been regularly using long-range drones of various types to strike targets in Russia, including hitting targets many hundreds of miles behind the front lines. Gudermes is around 780 miles from Odesa and around 650 miles from Kharkiv. As far as we know, this is the first time a Ukrainian drone strike has been launched against Chechnya, which is led by Kadyrov, a close ally of Putin who has frequently played on his warlord credentials to help bolster support for the war in Ukraine. Last month, Kadyrov garnered press coverage due to his claim that Tesla CEO Elon Musk had 'remotely disabled' his machine-gun-armed Cybertruck, which he had sent to the front line in Ukraine, where he said it had been 'performing well in combat.' 'What Elon Musk did was not nice. He gives expensive gifts from the heart and then remotely switches them off,' Kadyrov said, before noting that another pair of Cybertrucks had since been sent to the Ukrainian battlefield. More significantly, Kadyrov has contributed thousands of his own Chechen paramilitary forces to support the full-scale Russian invasion, since the very beginning of the operation. | At the special order of Ramazan Kadyrov, about 10,000 #Chechen National Guard departs to support the #Russia|n invasion of #Ukraine. - Local resources -pic.twitter.com/rUtUNmJ9hq&mdash; EHA News (@eha_news) February 25, 2022 Chechen servicemen from a Rosgvardia spetsnaz unit in Hostomel raising the Russia flag over a Ukrainian national guard base. pic.twitter.com/ceQjZ2Tgia&mdash; Rob Lee (@RALee85) February 26, 2022 Reportedly video of Chechen fighters headed to Ukraine on a transport aircraft. pic.twitter.com/rHUChT2ZeT&mdash; Rob Lee (@RALee85) March 13, 2022 While Kadyrov presents an image of staunch loyalty to Moscow, his position has also seen him emerge as one of the few political figures in Russia who speaks out about the way the war in Ukraine is being fought. Kadyrov has not held back from criticizing the Russian Armed Forces leadership when Ukrainian forces have made advances or offered tougher-than-expected resistance and he has suggested in the past that Putin might not be fully aware of the real situation on the ground in Ukraine. Earlier this year there were signs that the Kremlin might be looking to appoint a new Chechen leader, amid rumors that Kadyrov was seriously ill with pancreatic necrosis. The leader responded by publishing a workout video to counter claims of his deteriorating health. 'Remember that taking care of your health is an investment in your future,' a caption to the video read, while footage showed Kadyrov bench-pressing, lifting weights, and wrestling with a sparring partner. Interestingly, Kadyrov also moved to shore up his position as a staunch Putin supporter after the death of Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner mercenary group who launched a brief armed mutiny against Russia’s leadership in the summer of 2023, before being killed in a plane crash, the details of which remain murky. A day after Prigozhin’s funeral, Kadyrov — who had previously suggested that he could provide an alternative to the Wagner boss — described himself as Putin’s foot soldier and said he was ready to die for the Russian president. There were also suggestions Kadyrov might be lining himself up as Prigozhin’s successor, with his claims that former Wagner Group mercenaries were training in Chechnya with his forces.

Photo by Vyacheslav PROKOFYEV / POOL / AFP VYACHESLAV PROKOFYEV With repeated accusations of human rights violations, including torture and extrajudicial killings, as well as sanctions in multiple countries to his name, Kadyrov remains a very visible and highly active supporter of the Russian war effort. The fact the territory he rules over has come under long-range drone attack shouldn’t be too much of a surprise as Ukraine continues to expand its drone programs. There is a possibility that Russia’s failure to defend Kadyrov’s republic against drone attacks will lead to more criticisms leveled toward the Russian Ministry of Defense. Ever since Ukraine began its campaign of long-range drone strikes, there have been questions asked about the efficiency and preparedness of Russian air defenses to counter these threats. At the same time, depending on the damage that was inflicted, targeting the Russian University of Special Forces may also serve to disrupt the operations at what is, by all accounts, an important training center feeding both Russian soldiers and volunteers to support the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine. But above all else, this was a symbolic strike, although it could be the first of many more to come.

Next-Gen M1 Abrams Tank’s Active Protection System, Autoloader De...	The U.S. Army pushed back the start of work on a new integrated active protection system (APS) and autoloader for its planned next-generation iteration of the M1 Abrams tank, or M1E3, into the current fiscal year. The service announced last year that it had axed plans for another incremental upgrade for the M1 in favor of a major rework of the design focused heavily on new advanced capabilities, reduced weight, and increased fuel economy. The disclosure of 'the decision to delay the start until FY 2025 of the Integrated Main Battle Tank System effort which is specifically focused on the maturation of the autoloader and the active protection system' was included in a Pentagon budget document detailing various so-called reprogramming actions. The U.S. military has to, by law, seek approval from Congress to reallocate funds from one part of its budget to another. The Pentagon document, which is dated September 11, does not say exactly when the Integrated Main Battle Tank System work is expected to start, if it hasn't already. Fiscal Year 2025 began on October 1. A US Army M1 Abrams tank fires its main gun during training. US Army 'This decision maps with the schedule for the related program of record,' the reprogramming document says, as well as that the action helped free up $1.451 million for other priorities. General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS), the current prime contractor for the Abrams, received a preliminary M1E3 design contract last year. An APS that is not just an add-on system, but deeply integrated into the design, as well as an autoloader, are currently key planned elements of the future M1E3. 'That’s going to be substantially better than what we had with the installed Trophy system, which gives us great capabilities, but it’s not integrated,' Army Brig. Gen. Geoffrey Norman, head of the service's Next-Generation Combat Vehicle Cross Functional Team, told an audience at a Maneuver Warfighter Conference in September 2023, according to Breaking Defense. The Army has been integrating the Israeli-designed Trophy onto a portion of its existing Abrams tanks since 2017. Trophy is a hard-kill APS designed primarily to protect against anti-tank guided missiles, as well as other types of infantry anti-armor weapons, such as shoulder-fired rockets and rocket-propelled grenades. The system uses an array of small radars positioned around the vehicle it is installed on to detect threats and cue pre-loaded launchers. The launchers use a small explosive charge to expel a burst of kinetic projectiles to defeat or at least disrupt targets through force of impact. Trophy's manufacturer Rafael just recently unveiled a new version of the system that adds additional capabilities against top-down threats, including drones. An APS that is better optimized specifically for M1E3 and more streamlined into the design overall could have benefits both for the tank's physical structure and when it comes to auxiliary power and weight requirements. Add-on APSs like Trophy are often characterized by the addition of bulky and heavy protrusions around a vehicle, as well as sometimes onerous additional power demands. These issues have stymied Army attempts to add APSs to its Stryker light armored vehicles in recent years. Hard-kill APSs are only expected to become more important for tanks and heavy armored vehicles going forward. The new version of Trophy also underscores how these systems could help provide a critical additional layer of defense against growing threats posed by uncrewed aerial systems, something The War Zone previously explored in an in-depth feature. A US Army Abrams tank equipped with the Trophy APS. US Army via Leonardo An M1 Abrams tank with the Trophy APS installed. U.S. Army via Leonardo An autoloader for the main gun, a feature the U.S. military has historically eschewed on main battle tanks, is also set to be a key element of the M1E3's design. 'Are we looking at autoloaders for the tank to potentially reduce the crew size or allow for members to do different tasks? The short answer is absolutely, yes,' Brig. Gen. Geoffrey Norman said at the Maneuver Warfighter Conference last year. 'What that solution looks like, is one of those series of experiments that’s ongoing right now.' The autoloader will allow the tank to be operated by just three individuals, rather than the four currently required to crew existing Abrams variants. An auto-loading main gun and reduced crew also offer an avenue to make substantial changes to the tank's internal and external physical architecture, especially when it comes to the turret, which could help lower its profile and trim weight. It is worth noting here that autoloaders have been developed for the Abrams in the past, but have not been integrated onto any fielded variants of the tank to date. Whether the M1E3 might also come along with a new larger caliber or otherwise advanced main gun in place of the 120mm type found on Abrams today remains to be seen. 2/5 The magazine is double-row, closed-loop carousel of canisters that are cycled to place the requested round into a feed position, meaning you don't need the current big blast doors, instead just a small port (which is how most autoloaders with protected carousels work). pic.twitter.com/gEI9qVNG8P&mdash; Jon Hawkes (@JonHawkes275) October 22, 2024 4/5 The loading mechanism's 'operational swept volume does not encroach into any useable space within the turret', allowing you to keep all 4 crew (loader would do something else now). A few concept tanks have played with that 4th person becoming a systems operator for UAS/LM etc&mdash; Jon Hawkes (@JonHawkes275) October 22, 2024 Significantly reduced weight and a more economical hybrid propulsion system in lieu of the Abrams' existing fuel-hungry gas turbine powerplant are also expected to be key features of the final M1E3 design. Brig. Gen. Norman told Defense News that the goal weight-wise was to get the next-generation tank down to around 60 tons. With a full combat load, the latest M1A2 SEPv3 version tips the scale at around 78 tons. 'That might be a little aggressive, but we’re pretty ambitious,' Norman said. 'In order to do that, we anticipate having to change the crew configuration, potentially looking at opportunities to go to a remote turret or an optionally manned turret in order to save the space under armor.' GDLS has already presented one vision for what a future lighter-weight, hybrid-powered, autoloader-equipped, and otherwise redesigned Abrams might look like with its AbramsX demonstrator, which it rolled out in 2022. More broadly, the M1E3 effort, and lead-in work on APSs, autoloaders, and other systems, comes at a time when the Army is looking at a future where tanks, in general, might have a very different and de-emphasized role on the battlefield. While the ongoing war in Ukraine has underscored the continued relevance of heavy armored vehicles, the Army also expects the growing anti-armor threat ecosystem to present ever-more substantial challenges going forward, especially in any future high-end conflict. A slide from a briefing accompanying an Army Science Board report published in 2023 that gives a general overview of existing and emerging threats the M1 Abrams is facing. Army Science Board A slide from a briefing accompanying the Army Science Board's report that gives a general overview of existing and emerging threats the M1 Abrams is facing. Army Science Board 'Based on our findings, The M1 Abrams will not dominate the 2040 battlefield. All of the M1’s advantages in mobility, firepower, and protection are at risk,' an Army Science Board study published last year declares. 'The M1A2 SEP V3&4 upgrades will improve effectiveness but will not restore dominance. Near transparency in all domains will significantly increase the lethality our forces will experience. China and Russia have studied our forces and doctrine and are fielding countermeasures.' You can read more about that study and its findings here. With all this in mind, risk reduction work on key systems like APSs and autoloaders, which the Army is now scheduled to start this fiscal year, will be important as the service presses ahead in firming up its requirements for its next-generation Abrams tanks.

New Chinese Mystery Flattop Emerges	An example of an entirely new class of Chinese vessel with a large open flight deck has emerged at a shipyard in the southeastern end of the country. From what can be seen in satellite imagery, the ship has features in line with a light aircraft carrier or a big-deck amphibious assault ship, but there are some indications that it might be a first-of-its-kind ostensibly civilian ocean research vessel. China does have a long history of developing and fielding new maritime scientific research capabilities with clear potential military applicability. A satellite image of Guangzhou Shipyard International taken on October 23, 2024, showing, among other things, what looks to be a new class of Chinese ship with a large flight deck. PHOTO © 2024 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Tom Shugart, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) think tank, was among the first to spot the new ship under construction at Guangzhou Shipyard International (GSI) on Longxue Island just southeast of the city of Guangzhou. Shugart's attention had been drawn to the yard first by the appearance there of what looks to be a new high-speed trimaran uncrewed surface vessel (USV) that has reportedly been under construction in Guangzhou since at least 2022. An earlier Chinese trimaran USV design, which evoked the design of the U.S. Navy’s highly successful Sea Hunter, had previously emerged back in 2020. So it just jumped out to me that next to the possible new Chinese USV is what looks like might be&#8230;possibly a new aircraft carrier or amphibious assault ship of some sort? Appears to be about 200m long, with a beam of about 40m, and two islands on one side of the deck. pic.twitter.com/oHhMWYWQFZ&mdash; Tom Shugart (@tshugart3) October 28, 2024 From what can be seen in satellite imagery The War Zone has obtained from Planet Labs, the new large deck ship is around 656 feet (200 meters) long and some 131 feet (40 meters) at its widest. It looks to have a larger main island on the right side of the center of the deck, as well as a smaller one further toward the bow. In speaking with The War Zone, Shugart said there are also what might be exhaust stacks on the right side of the deck toward the stern. He further highlighted what looks to be an angular mast structure on top of the main island of a kind often seen in warships as a mount for radars and other sensors. Overall, the ship's size and what can be seen of its configuration are in line, at least in broad strokes, with many existing light aircraft carriers and big deck amphibious assault ships, such as Japan's Hyuga class and China's own Type 075. The new big deck ship at GSI also looks to have been built very quickly. There is no clear sign of it in high-resolution satellite imagery of GSI's yard from May, but it is visible in a drydock there in August and looks to have been launched sometime between September 10 and October 9. A satellite image taken on October 23, seen earlier in this story, shows further progress, including what appears to be work to finish the surface of the flight deck. A satellite image taken on September 10, 2024, showing the new big deck ship still in dry dock at GSI's yard. The trimaran USV being built there is also visible at bottom right. PHOTO © 2024 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION The carrier-esque ship's appearance at GSI's yard is curious in itself. The shipbuilder is best known, at least publicly, for constructing larger commercial vessels, such as oil tankers, ore carriers, roll-on/roll-off cargo ships, and semi-submersible heavy lift types. Floating cranes and dry docks, and even marine wind turbines, are seen in past imagery. At the same time, GSI's work does have a clear military dimension. Previous satellite images show numerous Soviet-designed Zubr class heavy hovercraft, which China has built examples of domestically under license. Also visible are what CNAS' Shugart says look to be large naval auxiliary type ships for the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), along with the new trimaran USV. Visible in the satellite image of the GSI yard taken on August 8 are a pair of Zubr class hovercraft (toward top right), a floating dry dock (toward the center), a floating crane (at bottom right), as well as the new big deck ship under construction dry dock (toward upper left) and and the apparent trimaran USV (at center). Also just visible at bottom right is one blade belonging to a maritime wind turbine. PHOTO © 2024 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION 'I was really surprised to see it,' Shugart told The War Zone about spotting the new big-deck ship in Guangzhou. 'It all depends on&#8230; what's kind of the bigger plan for the PLA Navy,' Shugart added when asked about what this might mean for GSI's portfolio going forward. 'Are they [the PLAN] continuing to grow? Are they growing at a rate that they need to start using some other shipyards?' It is certainly no secret that the PLAN's fleets have been growing substantially in recent years and continue to do so on the back of the country's substantial shipbuilding capacity, as The War Zone has explored in detail before. Work to expand the size and scope of the PLAN's battle force includes the production of new aircraft carriers, large amphibious assault ships, advanced submarines, and more modern surface combatants. Fujian, China's first catapult-assisted takeoff but arrested recovery (CATOBAR) configured carrier, and the first example of a new uniquely large big-deck amphibious ship that also features a catapult, commonly known as the Type 076, are prime important of the new naval capabilities the country has on the immediate horizon. A satellite image of the first Type 076 under construction at a different shipyard in China taken on September 27, 2024. PHOTO © 2024 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION. Fujian out finally Smoke is visible, lets see If itd for Trials this time pic.twitter.com/R6VFqEgeFl&mdash; Húrin (@Hurin92) April 29, 2024 A new class of light aircraft carrier, amphibious assault ship, or even a sea base-type vessel could offer the PLAN valuable additional operational capacity. A simpler design built more to commercial standards, and with an air component centered on crewed helicopters and drones, could also make a lot of sense for supporting certain missions. This might include presence operations, particularly in and around the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. Such a ship could be useful for supporting anti-submarine warfare and amphibious operations, too. Just being able to build these ships at an additional shipyard could help the PLAN further accelerate its expansion of naval aviation and other capabilities. At the same time, there may also be another uniquely Chinese explanation behind the appearance of the new vessel with its large flight deck in Guangzhou. Since at least 2022, a screenshot said to be from a Chinese government tender has been floating around the internet. A machine translation of its Chinese-language text shows a call for a 'large-scale special deck operation' ship for maritime survey and other test/research activities with some kind of flight deck featuring a 'double-island superstructure.' There is also a demand for a 'through-type straight deck' and a 'dock compartment' at the stern, which could refer to a floodable well deck like those found on many amphibious warfare ships. Stated requirements include that the vessel be 200 meters long, have a flight deck 25 meters wide, have a displacement of 15,000 tons, be capable of hitting a top speed of at least 16 knots, have a range of 5,000 nautical miles at a cruising speed of 12 knots, and a maximum at-sea endurance of 40 days. The provenance of this apparent tender is unclear and, at the time of writing, neither CNAS' Shugart nor The War Zone has been able to readily verify its source independently. Still, some Chinese netizens have taken this in the past to be evidence of potential plans for an ostensibly civilian oceanographic research 'carrier.' China's New Toy-Scientific Research Aircraft Carrier pic.twitter.com/wetiUq8VMS&mdash; 彩云香江 (@louischeung_hk) September 14, 2022 As already noted, the lines between civilian and military assets in China, especially when it comes to the maritime domain, are often at best blurry. The War Zone has highlighted this reality on multiple occasions in the past specifically with regard to ships and other capabilities ostensibly tasked with underwater survey, oceanographic research, and other ostensibly scientific missions. A non-military vessel configured like an amphibious assault ship – something no country in the world currently operates – would be able to employ aerial drones and crewed helicopters, and watercraft (crewed and uncrewed) to conduct scientific or other civilian missions. At the same time, it would inherently be capable of serving as a dual-use platform to support military missions like those previously described if called upon. Another possibility could be that whatever is being built in Guangzhou is some kind of bespoke military training and/or test platform. The Chinese already have a number of unusual naval platforms, including ones capable of launching and recovering vertical take-off and landing capable drones, primarily designed to fulfill such roles. Earlier this year, Naval News reported on the appearance of what looks be another such ship at the Jiangsu Dayang Marine shipyard near Shanghai. The vessel in question, which is around 328 feet (100 meters) long and has an open flight deck on top, was spotted alongside two catamaran drone mini-carriers that The War Zone was the first to report on in detail. Correction: the earlier drone carrier was more like 100m in length - still much smaller.&mdash; Tom Shugart (@tshugart3) October 28, 2024 CNAS's Shugart told The War Zone that the big deck vessel under construction at GSI looked too large, in his opinion, to have a similar test and/or training role. Given the speed with which the large deck ship looks to be being constructed in Guangzhou, it may not be long before a fuller picture of its configuration and intended purpose now emerges.

Israeli Strikes Knocked Out All Of Iran’s S-300 Air Defense Syste...	Iran is likely still tallying the costs of the Israeli airstrikes launched on Saturday in retaliation for Tehran’s massive October 1 missile barrage on Israel. Among the targets that Israel appears to have gone after are Iran’s prized Russian-made S-300 air defense systems, according to U.S. and Israeli officials. Putting the Iranian S-300s out of action leaves the door open to follow-up strikes by Israel, including larger-scale direct attacks. As we noted on Saturday, this serves as both a contingent opportunity for the Israel Defense Forces and a deterrent against a response from Iran. Among the critical Iranian military infrastructure destroyed on Saturday were its three surviving S-300 long-range surface-to-air missile systems. This is the assessment of unnamed U.S. and Israeli officials speaking to the Wall Street Journal. Iran’s only other S-300 system was already hit by Israel earlier this year. Elements of an Iranian S-300 air defense system during the annual military parade marking the anniversary of the outbreak of the 1980-1988 war with Iraq, in Tehran on September 21, 2024. Photo by ATTA KENARE / AFP ATTA KENARE The same officials disclosed that Iran managed to bring down 'few if any' of the missiles that Israel launched from around 100 jet fighters, during Saturday’s raid, codenamed Operation Days of Repentance. The officials’ statements tally with assessments from the U.S. think tank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), including descriptions of Israel inflicting 'serious damage to the Iranian integrated air defense network.' 'The IDF struck three or four S-300 sites, including one at the Imam Khomeini International Airport near Tehran,' the ISW adds. The think tank states that at least some of the air defense sites targeted were protecting critical energy infrastructure in western and southwestern Iran and identifies sites being hit at the Abadan oil refinery, the Bandar Imam Khomeini energy complex and port, and the Tang-eh Bijar gas field.

(1/7) pic.twitter.com/hhhh9srJ3N&mdash; Institute for the Study of War (@TheStudyofWar) October 28, 2024 'Degrading the air defenses around these sites could leave them more vulnerable to future strikes,' ISW contends. While the S-300 has been steadily updated since it was first introduced by the Soviet Union in the late 1970s, it is now an aging system and one that has proven vulnerable in Ukraine. Nevertheless, it remains a significant threat, especially if used as part of a layered air defense system, and these surface-to-air missile systems were the most capable of their kind available to Iran. Tehran was the recipient of one of the more modern iterations of the S-300, namely the S-300PMU-2 Favorit (known to NATO as the SA-20B Gargoyle), which was introduced in 1997 and which has improved anti-ballistic missile capabilities. It should be noted that, over the years the IAF has trained against the specific S-300 threat in several multinational air exercises, making use of S-300PMU-1 systems operated by Greece and S-300s in the U.S., and refining its tactics in the process.

Costas Metaxakis/AFP via Getty Images Replacement of Iran’s S-300s, at least in the near term, is hardly straightforward. Russia currently needs as much air defense equipment as it can produce, for the war in Ukraine, so the transfer of systems from its own stocks to Tehran seems less realistic. There’s also likely to be a long wait for new-production Russian air defense systems in the same class, like the more capable S-400. One option might be the deployment of one or two Russian batteries, as has happened before in Syria, but this would be more symbolic than anything else, and it is still less likely due to the strain on Russia’s own air defenses.

We also don't know the state of Iran's other air defense systems and networking architecture, which could have been attacked non-kinetically, especially using cyber tactics. There are unconfirmed reports from Israel that some kind of follow-up operation might already have been prepared, with claims that government targets and infrastructure could be next, although Iranian nuclear facilities will apparently be spared for now. Considering how Saturday’s airstrikes included significant softening up of Israeli air defenses, it is almost inevitable that Israel has several follow-up options already planned should Iran respond with another barrage. Israeli Channel 13, quoting military officials: We do not rule out that the Air Force will be forced to carry out another military operation in Iran.Any further attack on Iran will focus on government targets and infrastructure.We will not strike any Iranian nuclear targets…&mdash; Clash Report (@clashreport) October 28, 2024 Reports now indicate that the Israeli strikes on Saturday targeted around 20 military bases and facilities, across Iran, including missile and drone manufacturing sites, as well as the S-300 air defense systems. The attack killed at least four soldiers. As well as targeting air defense sites, including the S-300 systems, the Israeli attack was calculated to disrupt Iranian production of missiles and drones, something that should have a knock-on effect on Tehran’s proxies, such as Hezbollah and the Houthis, as well as for Russia. One of the missile production facilities appears to be the Shahroud factory in Semnan province, with evidence of damage there seen below. Although Shahroud is best known for its role in the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) space program, it is also assessed to be an important center for the large-scale production of short- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles, too.

In particular, the Israeli airstrikes appear to have targeted parts of the facility that were used for the production of the solid fuel that powers newer Iranian ballistic missiles. ISW predicts that Iran 'will likely need months or possibly a year or more' to acquire the equipment needed to replace these losses at Parchin. Since the raids, more footage has emerged showing apparent destruction at another Iranian site, namely at Shams Abad, near Arak, which is understood to be home to a major drone production facility.

It still remains unclear if any IAF aircraft flew into Iranian airspace, but some reports claim they did. Even using only standoff munitions, this may have been necessary in order to reach targets in eastern Iran, although they may not have had to penetrate far. At the same time, these weapons provide a combination of high accuracy and significant destructive power and are a major challenge to intercept. There are still differing accounts as to the number of munitions launched by the IAF. The deputy commanding officer of the Iranian Army’s Southwestern Command, Mohammad Mokhtari-far, today claimed that more than 600 missiles were launched by Israeli aircraft. Bearing in mind multiple reports suggesting around 100 Israeli aircraft were involved, this figure seems vastly inflated. On the other hand, it remains very likely that Israel also employed other means to degrade Iranian air defenses, including potential cyber-attacks.

In a protest letter sent to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the U.N. Security Council, Iraq condemned 'the Zionist entity’s blatant violation of Iraq’s airspace and sovereignty by using Iraqi airspace to carry out an attack on the Islamic Republic of Iran on 26 October.' We now also know a little more about some of the IAF aircraft and units that were involved in the strikes. Pilots from various units are quoted in a Jerusalem Post article, which references 119 Squadron and 201 Squadron, which both fly the F-16I Sufa, a long-range strike specialist. 'It was an honor to fly through the dark desert, knowing every moment in the air was a step toward a new dawn for Israel,' said Lt. Col. 'Y.,' commander of 119 Squadron. 'It was an honor to fly through the dark desert, knowing every moment in the air was a step toward a new dawn for Israel,' Lt. Col. Y., said of the mission that marked Israel’s largest strike on Iran in decades. The Jerusalem Post (@Jerusalem_Post) October 27, 2024 From the Iranian side, threats of retaliation continue. Maj. Gen. Hossein Salami, the chief of Iran’s IRGC, warned Israel it would face 'bitter consequences' after its attack on Saturday, according to local media reports. Salami was quoted today as having said that Israel had 'failed to achieve its ominous goals,' describing the airstrikes as symbolic of 'miscalculation and helplessness.' At the same time, however, there is debate in Iran about what kind of response Tehran should formulate. Iran now has to make a call as to whether to not respond at all, or at least with a direct attack like that on October 1, or whether to prepare some kind of retaliation that is seen as proportionate to the Israeli airstrikes — which were more limited than many expected.

'We do not seek war, but we will defend the rights of our nation and country,' Pezeshkian told a cabinet meeting yesterday. 'We will give an appropriate response to the aggression of the Zionist regime,' he added. Meanwhile, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said that Tehran will 'use all available tools' to respond to Israel’s attack, although provided no more details on how it would 'deliver a definite and effective response to the Zionist regime.' Finally, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said yesterday that the attack should not be 'exaggerated or downplayed' but also did not vow immediate retaliation. Meanwhile, there are reports that Khamenei is gravely ill, and the search for a potential successor could lead to a power struggle with possible repercussions on the conflict with Israel.

To reinforce the deterrence effect, Israeli officials now appear to be ramping up their threats of potential follow-up strikes. Time will tell if that Israeli calculation pays off.

Dozens Of AH-64, UH-60, and CH-47 Helicopters Were Damaged In Sto...	A total of 44 U.S. Army helicopters suffered various degrees of damage during a burst of extreme weather at Fort Carson in Colorado earlier this year. This includes AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, Black Hawk utility and medical evacuation types, and Chinook heavy lifters. The service has sought at least $29.3 million to help repair the aircraft, which represent a significant portion of the fleet assigned to the 4th Infantry Division's 4th Combat Aviation Brigade. The details about the scale and scope of the damage to helicopters at Fort Carson's Butts Army Heliport come from a Pentagon document detailing various so-called budgetary reprogramming actions approved in Fiscal Year 2024, which ended on September 30. By law, the U.S. military has to get approval from Congress to reallocate funding from one part of its budget to another. 2/ pic.twitter.com/jLQ8y1xr9O&mdash; Lord Bebo (@MyLordBebo) August 3, 2024 Butts Army Heliport was hit by what the Pentagon reprogramming action described as a 'severe microburst weather event' on August 1. The National Weather Service defines a microburst as 'a localized column of sinking air (downdraft) within a thunderstorm and is usually less than or equal to 2.5 miles in diameter.' 'Funds are required for Army helicopter repairs that were damaged&#8230; at Fort Carson, CO,' the Pentagon reprogramming document, which is dated September 11, says. 'The damaged helicopters are as follows: six AH-64D; seven AH-64E; seven CH-47F; nine UH-60M; ten HH-60M; and five UH-60L.' UH-60 Black Hawks assigned to the 4th Combat Aviation Brigade. US Army The approved reprogramming put an additional $29.333 million into the Army's Operation and Maintenance account for repairs. Whether this reflects the total assessed damage to all 44 helicopters or if any additional funding to help repair them has come from other sources is unknown. Whether any of those helicopters have already been repaired and returned to service is also not known. The War Zone has reached out to Fort Carson for more information. A stock photo of some of 4th Combat Aviation Brigade's CH-47 Chinooks. US Army 'A variety of aircraft are damaged to include Apaches, Chinooks, and Black Hawks,' authorities at Fort Carson had said in a statement back on August 2. 'Facilities on the heliport have minor damage. Currently, there are no environmental impacts reported. There will be a thorough investigation to assess the damage.' 'This weather event had a significant impact to our fleet. I am grateful there were no injuries,' Army Col. Nicholas Ploetz, commander of the 4th Combat Aviation Brigade, also said in a statement at the time. 'Our Soldiers are resilient and will do what is necessary to recover our equipment and continue to perform our mission.' How many helicopters of all types the 4th Combat Aviation Brigade had assigned to it on August 1 is unclear. At least as of 2010, a typical Army Combat Aviation Brigade had around 48 AH-64s, 38 UH-60s, 12 HH-60s, and 12 CH-47s, according to one official document. The extreme weather at Fort Carson came at the tail end of a fiscal year, which began on October 1, 2023, that had also seen a notable uptick in other kinds of Army aviation accidents. This includes the crash of a 4th Combat Aviation Brigade AH-64 back in March, which caused a temporary grounding of all aircraft at the Colorado base. That was one of four Apache mishaps in the space of two months. A pair of AH-64s assigned to 4th Combat Aviation Brigade. US Army A pair of AH-64 Apaches assigned to the 4th Combat Aviation Brigade. US Army In April, Army officials ordered a service-wide aviation safety 'standup' in the wake of 12 total crashes and 10 fatalities in the preceding six months. The service had suffered just nine Class A aviation mishaps in all of Fiscal Year 2023, according to Task & Purpose. At the time of writing, the U.S. military currently defines a Class A mishap as one in which the total assessed damage is $2.5 million or more; a crewed aircraft is deemed completely 'destroyed, missing, or abandoned'; at least one fatality or total permanent disability occurs; or some combination thereof. 'Of the numerous accidents we had this year, there was, there was not a single finding like 'this is the problem we have in aviation.' It's multifaceted,' Brig. Gen. Matthew Braman, Director of Army Aviation within the service's headquarters at the Pentagon, said earlier this month. '[The] majority of those findings are things that reside down at the unit level, where unit commanders can enforce policy existing policies that work.' Braman comments came during a panel discussion at the Association of the Army's main annual conference (AUSA) in Washington, D.C. 'There's also Army-level fixes that we're looking at. So, some of those are material fixes&#8230; certainly on the Apache side they're looking at ways to make improvements on certain aspects,' Braman added. A potentially serious issue with electrical power generators on Army AH-64s notably emerged last year, which service officials have said since they have been looking for long-term solutions to resolve. Braman also highlighted unspecified training and other materiel factors. The aftermath of another one of this year's Apache mishaps, this one occurring on February 13 and involving a Utah Army National Guard AH-64D.

There are no indications one way or the other currently that what happened at Fort Carson in August was the result of any negligence. We do now have a much fuller picture of just how significant the damage at Butts Army Heliport that left dozens of helicopters impacted.

Israel’s Reprisal Strike Carefully Calculated, Unclear If Jets Ev...	Israel's retaliation strike on Iran targeted air defense positions and long-range weapons facilities. Carried out primarily by the Israeli Air Force, it was a limited attack meant to weaken Tehran's offensive and defensive capabilities and to highlight Israel's deep strike capabilities. The strikes on air defense sites, in particular, made Iran more vulnerable to a larger follow-up strike, a clear deterrent against further escalation. By sticking to strictly military targets with few reported casualties, the operation also fell within the guidelines suggested by the Biden administration, and the threshold Iranian officials had previously suggested would result in no further kinetic actions. The strikes were in retaliation for the massive Oct. 1 Iranian ballistic missile barrage on Israel. Some 20 targets were hit, 'including the S-300 air defense of Imam Khomeini International Airport which provides defense cover for parts of the sprawling capital,' The New York Times reported, citing two Iranian officials, including a member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp (IRGC). 'In Tehran Province, at least three Revolutionary Guards missile bases were attacked, the officials said,' according to The Times. 'In a second round of Israeli strikes, the officials said, Israeli drones targeted the secretive Parchin military base in the outskirts of Tehran and one drone hit the base while others were shot down, they added.' It is unclear exactly what drones would have been used or if the weapon type stated is indeed accurate. U.S. and Israeli officials 'reported that three waves of airstrikes took place on Saturday morning local time, later named Operation Days of Repentance, the Jerusalem Post reported. 'The first wave targeted Iran’s air defense system, while the second and third focused on missile and drone bases and weapons production sites.' Satellite images emerged on social media purporting to show damage to a facility in Khojir as well as Iran's new solid-propellant rocket motor plant in Parchin, about 950 miles east of Israel. The plant was opened in 2021, according to Fabian Hinz, a Research Fellow Defense and Military Analysis at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. It is reportedly associated with the production of fuel for Scud, Fateh 110, and Zelzal ballistic missiles, we previously reported. In October 2014, there was a massive explosion at Parchin, which many believed was the result of sabotage by Israeli or American intelligence services.

Source: @ArmedForcesJO @Petranews ⁦@AlMamlakaTV⁩ Dana Zureikat Daoud دانا زريقات (@DanaZkat) October 26, 2024 As expected, Israel launched munitions over Iraq. Video and images emerged on social media purported to show a spent booster from an Israeli air-launched ballistic missile that was found in Iraq. The last and only time Israel struck Iran directly using traditional airpower came last Spring after Iran sent a barrage of drones and missiles at Israel. Following that Israeli response, it became clear an air-launched ballistic missiles were used to do so. A booster for one of these weapons, which Israel has an impressive and growing portfolio of, was found in a field in Iraq close to the Iran-Iraq border. TWZ did a breakdown on exactly what was found and its implications you can read here. Yesterday we posited that more of these would show up in this area today. These weapons, which include Rocks and Air LORA, allow the IAF to strike deep into another country from great standoff distances and do so with a weapon that hits very hard with high-accuracy and is extremely challenging to intercept. Another Missile Booster was found in Samarra city, western Salah Alden. #Iraq pic.twitter.com/QETVOGmDKo&mdash; Tammuz Intel (@Tammuz_Intel) October 26, 2024 Missile booster was found in Salah Alden Governorate, northern #Iraq, that was used in last night's attack on Tehran. #Iran pic.twitter.com/T1LzB7yuOY&mdash; Tammuz Intel (@Tammuz_Intel) October 26, 2024 Lots of spent air launched ballistic missile boosters near the Iran-Iraq border will likely show up on social media tomorrow.&mdash; Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) October 26, 2024 The question still remains if any IAF crewed assets ever even entered into Iranian airspace. Standoff munitions, especially air-launched ballistic missiles, could have been responsible for striking the limited target sets that were hit. This would have several critical advantages. First, doing so would result in a far less complex, lower-risk operation that could be executed and finished in a number of hours not days, with much fewer assets needed over a much shorter timeframe. It would also not necessitate the U.S. being directly involved in the operation, especially in a support role, such as providing aerial refueling. Second, the risk of losing a crew and having to attempt a rescue would also be far less of an issue as it would be only limited to Syria and Iraq, where Israel already operates and has long-standing contingency plans for. While Jordan and Saudi Arabia, if their airspace was used, have better diplomatic ties with Israel to deal with such an occurrence, and still CSAR could be able to cover those areas as well. The distance and hostility related to Iran makes doing so a much more risky and complex affair. Third, using standoff weapons, once again especially ALBMs, the suppression/destruction of enemy air defenses campaign could also be drastically reduced, if needed really at all. Many special capabilities, such as electronic warfare and cyber attacks, could be withheld for future contingencies. It's still possible that unmanned platforms were used even if manned ones were not, potentially including clandestine ones with penetrating capabilities. These are just some key points, there are others including adhering to U.S. demands as far as the mission's scope and risk for rapid escalation. The IDF released images and video showing F-15 and F-16 fighters that took part in the attack. One of those F-15 Bazs, marked 957 'Sky Blazer,' has an interesting history. 'It was involved in a mid-air collision with an A-4 during a training exercise over the Negev in 1983, according to Times of Israel reporter Emanuel Fabian. 'The F-15 managed to land safely and was later repaired.' Over the years, 'Sky Blazer has downed 4.5 Syrian planes (half because another F-15 was involved in shooting down a Syrian MiG-23 in 1985, and it was unclear which one launched the missile that ultimately caused the plane to be shot down),' he added. 'The same F-15 also participated in September's strikes on the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen.' Fun fact about the F-15 marked 957 'Sky Blazer' seen in this video.

They are heavily laden with fuel, with the F-15 packing three tanks and the F-16 packing three as well, including two 600-gallon wing tanks — the largest any F-16 can carry — as well as the F-16Is standard conformal fuel tanks. The question of if and how Tehran will respond looms large over the region. 'It is too soon to say,' an administration official told The War Zone Saturday. On Saturday, U.S. President Joe Biden 'convened a call with Vice President Kamala Harris and their national security team to receive a briefing and discuss the latest developments in the Middle East following Israel’s precise response to Iran’s ballistic missile attack on October 1st,' according to the White House press pool. 'President Biden directed that every effort be taken to protect our forces and help defend Israel against any potential responses from Iran and its proxies.' 'I was on with the intelligence community for the last half hour,' Biden said. 'It looks like they didn’t hit anything other than military targets. I hope that this is the end.' Iranian authorities 'strongly condemned' the attack, saying they reserved the right to respond. However, they downplayed the results, a possible indication that they may not. Iran’s Foreign Ministry on Saturday decried yesterday’s attack against military targets 'as a clear violation of the international law, the UN Charter, and the article on the prohibition of threat or use of force against the territorial integrity and sovereignty of states, according to the official Tasnim news agency.

To that end, it Israeli officials contacted Iran before the attack and said what they would and would not hit, according to the Jerusalem Post.

'You played with the lion's tail,' warned Hesamoddin Ashena, adviser to former Iranian president Hassan Rouhani. '&#8230; This is Iran.' In what may be an indication of the government’s intentions, Iranian state media messaging dismissed the Israeli attack. They said it caused little damage and no upheaval to civilian life. Officials said air defenses downed most of the incoming missiles, no oil refineries or nuclear facilities were hit, and that casualties were limited to four soldiers who were killed. Outlets like Tasnim and IRNA portrayed a return to calm in Iran, with markets bustling, streets filled with traffic, and aircraft arriving and departing from Imam Airport in Tehran.

B-21 Taking On Some Of NGAD Fighter’s Missions On The Table Air F...	The U.S. Air Force has not ruled out expanding the roles and missions of the B-21 Raider stealth bomber as part of its ongoing reassessment of plans for a new crewed sixth-generation stealth 'fighter.' This is not the first time the service has at least alluded to the possibility of an air-to-air combat role for the Raider. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin talked about the B-21 and the future of the sixth-generation combat jet that has been under development as part of his service's Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative earlier today at the 2024 Military Reporters & Editors (MRE) Conference. The plans for the NGAD aircraft, also sometimes referred to as the Penetrating Counter-Air (PCA) platform, are currently undergoing a deep review. Concerns about very high expected costs – individual fighter-like NGAD aircraft potentially costing $300 million or more apiece – have been cited as the central driver behind the reassessment. The first pre-production B-21 Raider. USAF The first pre-production B-21 Raider at Plant 42 ahead of its first flight. USAF 'We intend to have that by December,' Allvin said when asked about the timeline for when the NGAD combat jet review is expected to be finished. 'We also want to be able to influence the&#8230; [proposed] budget submission in February. So, obviously, all that has to go through DOD [the Department of Defense]. So we're looking to have the results in December.' 'As the NGAD review goes forward, like, is it possible that what that ends up with could be the B-21 taking a larger role?' Defense News' Stephen Losey asked Allvin later in his talk. 'We have not taken that off the table,' the Air Force's top officer said in response. Allvin did not elaborate on what this might mean for the B-21, but as already noted, this is not the first time the possibility of an 'air dominance' role for the Raider has come up. 'If we were to characterize it [NGAD] as a fighter, we would be… thinking too narrowly about what kind of airplane we need in a highly contested environment,' then-Air Force Maj. Gen. Scott Pleus, told what was then Air Force Magazine back in 2019. 'A B-21 that also has air-to-air capabilities' and can 'work with the family of systems to defend itself, utilizing stealth – maybe that’s where the sixth-generation airplane comes from.' At the time, Pleus was Director of Air and Cyber Operations for Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), the Air Force's top command in that region. Now a lieutenant general, he is currently Director of Staff at the Air Force's Headquarters at the Pentagon. It remains unclear whether Pleus' 2019 comments explicitly reflected an idea for employing the B-21 in air-to-air combat, or if he was referring to a similarly sized and/or otherwise capable aircraft. Renderings of very stealthy tailless designs, like the one below from Lockheed Martin, have historically been used to illustrate discussions about the NGAD combat jet. Lockheed Martin At the same time, as The War Zone has explored in detail in the past, the B-21's size, long range, high-altitude ceiling, broadband low-observability (stealthiness), and other capabilities could actually make it well suited to supporting certain forms of air-to-air combat. The Raider has the potential to serve as a launch platform for air-to-air missiles, especially outsized very long-range types. Its payload capacity would give it the ability to carry a large volume of smaller air-to-air missiles, as well. B-21s could also employ air-to-ground munitions in support of the suppression and destruction of enemy air defenses mission (SEAD/DEAD), which is also part of the air superiority equation. Maybe most significantly, the B-21s could also act as airborne nerve centers in support of counter-air missions, especially for controlling drones like the Air Force's planned fleets of Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA), and have the ability to do so even in the most heavily contested of airspaces. Uncrewed aircraft, in turn, could feed targeting data back to Raiders with air-to-air loadouts. B-21s might even be able to launch some of those drones themselves. The video below from Collins Aerospace offers a good visual depiction of how CCA-type drones might work together with crewed aircraft in an air-to-air combat scenario, including by extending the sensor reach of the entire force. 'What is the role, if any, of a CAA in consonance with the B-21 as it’s fielded?' then-Air Force Lt. Gen. James Slife, at the time Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, asked rhetorically at the annual Defense News Conference last year. 'We should we should keep our options open for how we employ them going forward.' Gen. Slife is now Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force. Labeling the B-21 as simply a bomber is already something of a misnomer. 'The B-21 is multi-functional,' Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said at the roll-out ceremony for the first pre-production Raider in December 2022. 'It can handle anything from gathering intel to battle management.' The first pre-production B-21 in flight. USAF How any increased role for the B-21 might impact broader plans for the Raider is unclear. Allvin took the time today to push back on comments this week from Kathy Warden, CEO of Northrop Grumman, the prime contractor for the B-21, about possible changes on the horizon to the planned Raider force structure. The Air Force's publicly stated plan remains to buy 100 of these aircraft. 'I can see that being something in the future [that changes]. &#8230;we do not currently have a plan to do that in the next month or two,' Allvin said. 'I think we'll understand more about it [as testing proceeds] that will give us more confidence [about fleet size].' 'But there's also going forward to understand the capability, the capabilities that are bearing out, along with the price point,' the Air Force Chief of Staff continued. 'So far, the program has been run very well, and so the usual price ballooning we haven't seen.' 'We do not have that on the front burner right now to re-evaluate' the planned B-21 fleet size, he added. In April, Allvin had also told members of Congress that 100 B-21s was still the plan, as well as that his service was already looking ahead to augment the Raiders with new capabilities. Photo courtesy of Jonathan Case, Northrop Grumman It is important to stress that the reassessment of the NGAD combat jet plans is ongoing and we know it is intended to be exhaustive. Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall has talked repeatedly now about how the service is also considering a significantly cheaper (and similarly less capable in certain regards) crewed stealth aircraft focused primarily on the drone controller mission as another alternative. You can read more about what that plane could look like here. With the Air Force hoping to have the completed review of its NGAD 'fighter' plans in hand before the end of the year, it might not be too long before more details about its conclusions, and how they may or may not relate to the B-21, start trickling out.

NATO Flexes With Simultaneous Nuclear Strike And Naval Warfare Ex...	Steadfast Noon, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s annual tactical nuclear weapons exercise in Europe, was completed yesterday, having been run simultaneously with the British-led Strike Warrior large-scale maritime maneuvers, centered around a British Carrier Strike Group. The combined drills sent a powerful message to Russia, not just in terms of NATO’s enduring nuclear strike potential in Europe but also in regards to its diverse conventional military capabilities spread across the continent. This year’s Exercise Steadfast Noon began on October 14 and ended on October 24. In a statement, the alliance confirmed that 'more than 60' aircraft took part, as well as around 2,000 military personnel from eight air bases. #steadfastnoon24 is a two week EX conducted in the area of Western Europe. The main purpose is to train the Allies in Nuclear deterrence. For the first time, the F35-A is showing her abilities. #strongertogether @NATO pic.twitter.com/gkPIf16NPw&mdash; NATO JFC Naples (@JFC_Naples) October 23, 2024 Steadfast Noon is concerned entirely with nuclear deterrence and involves training flights over Western Europe each fall. The aircraft that take part are nuclear-capable but there are no live warheads used in the exercise. In the past, we have explored exactly what procedures are likely practiced in Steadfast Noon and how these drills are a cornerstone for ensuring readiness to launch a nuclear attack during a crisis. Under the NATO nuclear-sharing arrangement, U.S. B61 nuclear gravity bombs are understood to be housed in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Turkey, and can be employed by tactical jet aircraft from approved member states. Turkey notably hosts B61s, but is not among the countries that could employ them. Non-strategic NATO combat jets currently capable of carrying nuclear weapons include the F-15E, F-35A, F-16, and Tornado. They are referred to as Dual-Capable Aircraft (DCAs) in NATO parlance, and you can read more about them here. A frontal view of four B61 nuclear gravity bombs on a bomb cart. Defense Department photo by SSGT PHIL SCHMITTEN 'Nuclear deterrence is the cornerstone of allied security,' NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said, ahead of this year’s exercise. 'Steadfast Noon is an important test of the Alliance’s nuclear deterrent and sends a clear message to any adversary that NATO will protect and defend all allies.' The host countries for this year’s Steadfast Noon were Belgium and the Netherlands (Kleine Brogel and Volkel air bases, respectively), with most training flights taking place over these nations, as well as over Denmark, the United Kingdom, and the North Sea.

A notable feature of this year’s nuclear exercise was the involvement of Royal Netherlands Air Force F-35As, for the first time since these were declared ready to perform nuclear roles, with the B61-12 thermonuclear bomb. You can read more about this development here. An F-35A drops an inert B61-12 bomb during a certification test flight. U.S. Air Force B-52s have been involved in Steadfast Noon before. Although Steadfast Noon is a tactical nuclear exercise and the Stratofortress is a strategic platform, the exercise also involves a range of aircraft working in packages to get the Dual-Capable Aircraft into the target area. Such scenarios could include B-52s delivering conventional weapons. For some time now, the only nuclear weapons available to the B-52 are cruise missiles – currently AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missiles (ALCMs) that are set to be eventually replaced by new AGM-181 Long Range Stand-Off (LRSO) types. Supporting these nuclear strike platforms were various fighter escorts, aerial refueling tankers, airborne early warning, and electronic warfare aircraft.

Matthews, JADTEU In all, 13 NATO nations took part on some level. According to reports ahead of Steadfast Noon, other countries involved comprised the Czech Republic (with Gripen multirole fighters), Denmark (F-16), Finland (F/A-18), Greece (F-16), Poland (F-16), Romania (F-16), Turkey (F-16), and the United Kingdom (F-35B and Typhoon). Meanwhile, non-nuclear-capable Eurofighter EF2000s from both Germany and Italy were also listed as participants.

The country applied to join the alliance in May 2022, along with Sweden, in response to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Poland, meanwhile, is not currently a member of NATO’s nuclear weapon-sharing program but has expressed an interest in at least hosting weapons in the past. This policy position has been underscored by concerns over Russia’s decision last year to forward-deploy nuclear weapons in Belarus in cooperation with that country’s military.

In particular, the think tank notes that there has been significant recent modernization of infrastructure at nuclear-tasked air bases in Europe. 'This modernization involves security upgrades to the underground vaults that store the U.S. nuclear weapons, underground cables and nuclear command and control systems, and facilities needed for the new F-35A nuclear-capable fighter-bomber,' FAS states in its related report.

Public Domain/WikiCommons Modernization has included special loading pads at Kleine Brogel in Belgium, Ghedi in Italy, and Volkel in the Netherlands to receive U.S. Air Force C-17 airlifters that transport nuclear weapons and service equipment. Kleine Brogel has also received major upgrades to its weapons maintenance facilities, where nuclear weapons are stored and worked on. At Volkel, FAS has identified the construction of a new wall in front of an aircraft parking area, to keep this hidden from spotters and other observers outside the base. NATO's annual tactical nuclear weapons exercise Steadfast Noon begins today. Here is a backgrounder including what is happening at the different nuclear bases: pic.twitter.com/4aAX7SvDEu&mdash; Hans Kristensen (@nukestrat) October 14, 2024 In Germany, Büchel air base is midway through an upgrade that is adding, among others, a service area for Germany’s future nuclear-capable F-35As and a refurbished runway. There is also evidence here of security upgrades for the nuclear weapons area and a possible loading pad for C-17s. One other NATO air base in particular has come under extensive scrutiny in recent months. This is RAF Lakenheath in England, used by the U.S. Air Force, where the nuclear mission is expected to return after a long absence. The base is home to the 48th Fighter Wing, part of U.S. Air Forces in Europe, which includes squadrons of nuclear-capable F-15Es and F-35As. One of the first F-35As for the 48th Fighter Wing (specifically, the constituent 495th Fighter Squadron) touches down at RAF Lakenheath in December 2021. U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Koby I. Saunders However, there is still a degree of mystery around the nature of the nuclear mission at the U.K. base. Since 2022, Lakenheath has been listed as one of the NATO bases undergoing nuclear upgrades. The Pentagon has remained tight-lipped about this, but construction work on new aircraft shelters and underground vaults to store nuclear weapons has been confirmed by satellite images. Whether nuclear weapons will be permanently stored at Lakenheath is unclear and it remains possible that the facilities here are intended as a backup for the other air bases in Europe with a NATO nuclear mission. The total number of aircraft in Steadfast Noon appears to have been a modest increase over the number of aircraft involved in last year’s drill ('up to 60') but more significant is the fact that NATO air forces in Europe were simultaneously engaged in Exercise Strike Warrior. The U.K.-run Strike Warrior maneuvers took place primarily off the coast of Scotland over the same timeframe and had the main role of confirming that the U.K. Royal Navy’s Carrier Strike Group, centered around the aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales, is ready for operations.

Russia’s Iskander-M short-range ballistic missile can carry a nuclear or a conventional warhead and is among the country’s available tactical nuclear weapons. Vitaly Kuzmin via Wikimedia The rhetoric from Moscow has included repeated threats by President Vladimir Putin to use nuclear weapons, as he seeks to thwart NATO support for Ukraine and, especially, to try and ensure that limits remain on Ukraine’s use of Western-supplied long-range weapons to strike targets within Russia’s recognized borders. Moscow has also held its own high-profile tactical nuclear exercises. These drills have been accompanied by the announcement of possible changes to Russia’s nuclear doctrine. These have included the suggestion that the Kremlin’s threshold for the potential use of nuclear weapons may have been lowered, although the exact permutations of this — and whether it really constitutes a significant change — have been subject to some debate. NATO has always reiterated that the Steadfast Noon isn’t targeted toward any nation, in particular. A NATO video published yesterday described a 'fictitious red adversary,' although the identity of the alliance’s primary nuclear foe has always been clear. #SteadfastNoon24 showcases NATO's nuclear deterrence in today’s world.

In that context, exercises that put to the test the nuclear and conventional might of the alliance, like those carried out in recent days, have become especially relevant.

Our First Look At The Ghost Shark Uncrewed Submarine Underwater	We have now gotten our first look at the Ghost Shark extra-large autonomous undersea vehicle (XL-AUV) operating submerged thanks to the Autonomous Warrior 2024 maritime autonomous capabilities demonstration in Australia. The Royal Australian Navy (RAN) is the first known customer for the highly modular Ghost Shark, which manufacturer Anduril is now pitching elsewhere, including to the U.S. Navy. The Australian Department of Defense released a video montage, seen below, from Autonomous Warrior 2024 that includes clips of Ghost Shark below the waves this week. The event took place predominantly in and around Jervis Bay on Australia's eastern coast over a period of three weeks earlier this month. There are two separate clips of the Ghost Shark in the Autonomous Warrior 2024 video, captures from which are seen at the top of this story and below. In both cases, the top of the mast at the front of the drone submarine appears to be blurred out. Australian Department of Defense capture Ghost Shark's mast, which is distinctly lower profile than what is typically found on other uncrewed underwater vehicles (UUV), is a particularly notable feature of the design. Otherwise, what can be seen in the Autonomous Warrior 2024 video looks to be in line with imagery of the drone submarine that has been released since it first broke cover in April. 'We don’t have big masts running down the backbone of our vehicle that a lot of other designs do that then preclude the ability for the payloads to come out in different directions… of the payload module itself,' Dr. Shane Arnott, Senior Vice President for Engineering at Anduril and the company’s maritime lead, told The War Zone in an interview back in August. 'So we have… in effect, unlimited flexibility in this design, just the way that we’ve configured the vehicle and the payload bay itself could be almost anything within a size configuration that you can dream up. We haven’t encountered crazy idea yet from a customer that … we can’t fit.' Australian Defense Force Australian authorities have said they expect to use their future fleet of Ghost Sharks for 'persistent intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance [ISR] and strike,' but have provided no additional details so far about how the drone submarines might be configured to perform those missions. Anduril has also declined to provide more specific information about the UUV's capabilities, including its maximum range and endurance. You can read more about what is known about the design to date here. Regardless, events like Autonomous Warrior 2024 offer important opportunities for the RAN and Anduril to further test and refine Ghost Shark capabilities, as well as explore how they can be alongside other crewed and uncrewed platforms. Anduril announced earlier this year that it had brought a Ghost Shark to the United States for the first time as part of efforts to expand its capacity to test the UUV, as well as demonstrate it to prospective customers. 'There’s just a lot of test points for us to hit. So, having the ability to have multiple Ghost Sharks, and particularly in different waters around the world, such that we can burn down those test points and just grow our trust and the customer’s trust by testing and ‘show me, don’t tell me,’ is kind of a really big part of why we’ve done this [bringing the UUV to the United States,' Anduril's Arnott explained to us earlier this year. A Ghost Shark drone submarine being lowered into the water during previous testing. Australian Defense Force Ghost Shark was not the only uncrewed platform involved in Autonomous Warrior 2024, which is part of a larger Australian maritime autonomy initiative called Maritime Big Play (MBP) and is also tied in with the 'advanced capabilities' Pillar II of the trilateral Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS) defense cooperation agreement. Pillar I of the AUKUS agreement centers on the RAN's acquisition and fielding of a nuclear-powered submarine force and assisting with that effort. Maritime Big Play also has links to the U.S. military's Technology Readiness Experimentation (T-REX) effort and NATO's Robotic Experimentation and Prototyping Augmented by Maritime Unmanned Systems (REPMUS) exercise series, according to the Pentagon. The U.S. Navy has also been conducting a growing number of large-scale uncrewed-focused maritime exercises and demonstration events in recent years. Also seen in the Australian Department of Defense video are Greenough Advanced Rescue Craft (GARC), Swiftships Sea-Stalker, and Ocius Bluebottle uncrewed surface vessels, as well as a REMUS-series UUV. Ocean Aero's Triton hybrid UUV/USV and at least one other larger UUV design are visible at points in the montage, too, as are various uncrewed aerial systems and high-altitude balloons. GARC (at left) and Sea-Stalker USVs in use at Autonomous Warrior 2024. Australian Department of Defense capture A trio of Ocius Bluebottle USVs sail together during Autonomous Warrior 2024.

Australian Department of Defense capture There are two clips showing the apparent launch of a payload from the hull of what may be a docked RAN Collins class submarine based on a flag seen in the background. What is being fired and why is not entirely clear, but it has a torpedo-like outward appearance and could be an expendable countermeasure of some kind. The U.S. Navy and others have also been actively working on submarine-launched aerial drones and UUVs, including types small enough to be launched from existing countermeasures launchers. A screen capture showing the payload launch. Australian Department of Defense capture Another view of the payload launch. Australian Department of Defense capture 'A versatile and robust software-defined network architecture called Multi-Domain Uncrewed Secure Integrated Communications (MUSIC) was tested for its ability to enable seamless communication and coordination across diverse unmanned systems and operational environments' during Autonomous Warrior 2024, according to a Pentagon press release. 'The Common Control System (CCS) was also featured in the exercise, built on an open architecture to provide uncrewed vehicles hardware and software that works across several different systems. This effort supports future work to create an AUKUS-wide Common Control System, fusing [the] best elements of the three countries’ existing systems.' The three AUKUS partners increasingly see uncrewed maritime platforms above and below the waves, as well as aerial drones, as not only important, but critical for providing increased sensor coverage, wider and more resilient communications networks, and other capabilities, and for doing so in cost-effective manners. The U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps, in particular, are envisioning future fleets of UUVs and USVs that can carry out kinetic attacks and employ electronic warfare and other non-kinetic effects, as well as emplace mines. The US Navy envisions its future Orca UUVs, the first of which is seen here with its top-mounted mast deployed and a payload module installed with a top-opening bay, as being uncrewed mine layers, at least initially. USN Evidence continues to grow from wargames carried out by the U.S. military and other organizations that uncrewed aerial and maritime capabilities could have especially decisive impacts in a future high-end fight across the broad expanses of the Pacific against China, especially one over Taiwan. With this in mind, America's armed forces have been helping Taiwan with a plan to defend the island against an invasion from the mainland by turning the airspace and waters into a 'hellscape' full of uncrewed platforms, as you can read more about here. 'Autonomous Warrior/Maritime Big Play creates a unique opportunity for our three countries to work together, which will ultimately improve operational efficiency and allow us to work more cohesively against common threats,' Heidi Shyu, Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, said in a statement about Autonomous Warrior 2024 this week. 'This collaborative approach enables us to reduce acquisition, maintenance, and training cost by creating economies of scale.' It's worth noting here that members of the Japan Self-Defense Forces observed Autonomous Warrior 2024, which was the first time members of that country's armed forces had been present at a Maritime Big Play event. Australian military officials brief their Japanese counterparts during Autonomous Warrior 2024. Australian Department of Defense 'All of this together underpins a more strategic approach to ensure that AUKUS and like-minded partners can operate new autonomous uncrewed systems more effectively as a coalition force from the start,' Madeline Mortelmans, the U.S. official currently performing the duties of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy, Plans and Capabilities, also said in a statement about Autonomous Warrior 2024 this week. The AUKUS triumvirate is now reportedly considering increasing Japan's involvement in Pillar II activities. This is in line with broader and largely U.S.-led efforts to create a more unified front among allies and partners in the Pacific to challenge Beijing. 'AUKUS partners have long histories of working together on defense and security issues, and have deep, enduring partnerships based on shared values,' Under Secretary Shyu said. 'By investing in novel and innovative capabilities directly aligned to AUKUS mission priorities, as well as making future advancements in emerging technologies like AI [artificial intelligence] and Quantum [computing], we support a more stable region — one where all nations are empowered to make their own sovereign decisions free from coercion — a world that centers on hope for the opportunity and prosperity of the future.' Ghost Shark, which we have now finally seen plying its way underwater, and the platforms involved in Autonomous Warrior 2024 all reflect this broader vision of the coming uncrewed ecosystem.

Germany Plans To Buy Advanced New Taurus Cruise Missiles: Report	Germany has announced plans to acquire 600 examples of a new version of the Taurus air-launched conventional cruise missile, which would provide a major boost to the country’s long-range strike capabilities. Unclear is whether the Taurus Neo purchase might finally see approval for the transfer of older Taurus KEPD 350 weapons to Ukraine, with Berlin so far having blocked such a move despite Kyiv’s requests for them. Even if Ukraine gets its wish, it will be a long time before the Taurus Neo comes online, potentially freeing up older KEPD 350 versions. The German Minister of Defense Boris Pistorius wants to buy advanced versions of the missiles, but has yet to secure funds from the government, according to a report in the Spiegel magazine. A Taurus KEPD 350 cruise missile is loaded onto a German Tornado strike aircraft. MBDA MBDA The same source states that the 600 new missiles would cost around $2.3 billion and could see the first deliveries in 2029. Pistorius plans for the Taurus Neo to be included as an option in the 2025 budget, which would require a starting investment of around $379 million. The Luftwaffe or German Air Force already received 600 of the original Taurus KEPD 350 missiles, which have a range of more than 500 kilometers (311 miles). In German service, these are launched from the Tornado swing-wing strike fighter. Although they have also been tested from the Eurofighter EF2000, the Luftwaffe doesn’t currently use the more modern fighter as a Taurus delivery platform. A German Eurofighter EF2000 jet seen carrying a pair of Taurus cruise missiles, but the capability to employ them from EF2000s was never fully developed. Philipp Hayer/Wikimedia Commons It’s unclear what platform the Taurus Neo would be launched from, but the upcoming retirement of the Tornado fleet makes this much less likely. That would leave the Eurofighter as the most likely option. Potential integration on the F-35A stealth fighter, which Germany has also ordered, seems highly unlikely, with the missile needing a significant redesign to even fit in the internal weapons bay on the U.S.-made jet. Looking further ahead, Germany could plan to add the Taurus Neo to the crewed fighter that will be at the center of the next-generation combat aircraft program being pursued by Belgium, France, Germany, and Spain, known as the Future Combat Air System, or FCAS. The original Taurus KEPD 350 was designed to destroy high-value targets deep behind enemy lines, including command bunkers, ammunition and fuel dumps, airfields, and bridges. A Taurus missile in flight. Photo by South Korean Defense Ministry via Getty Images Designed to penetrate air defenses via a very low-level terrain following flight, the turbojet-powered Taurus missile carries a 1,060-pound dual-stage warhead, known as MEPHISTO. This uses a precursor charge to punch through hardened structures followed by the main change that can be fuzed for penetration mode when required, meaning it detonates after breaching the target. The MEPHISTO warhead can also be programmed to detonate on a specific pre-selected floor of a given building. The missile guidance system is based on an inertial navigation system (INS) that is continuously provided with GPS updates. There is also an image-based terrain reference sensor, which provides the capability to attack what the manufacturer describes as 'semi-stationary targets.' There are so far no details available about the improvements planned for the Taurus Neo, although potential changes could involve extended range, more destructive warhead, low-observable features, a new seeker, or a combination of these. Less likely, but also potentially under consideration could be increased speed, perhaps combined with defensive countermeasures to better defeat advanced air defense systems. Other modifications to improve the chances of penetrating hostile air defenses could include electronic support measures (ESM) to autonomously avoid the highest-threat areas. There’s also the possibility of a new-production version of the missile with relatively minor changes compared with the original KEPD 350. Speaking this summer, Thomas Gottschild, the managing director of MBDA Deutschland GmbH, which makes the missile, confirmed that although not currently in production, the assembly line could be reactivated at short notice. 'What we need is an order to activate our supply chain, a good dozen suppliers contribute to a complex missile like Taurus. These suppliers only start working for us with an order,' Gottschild said. However, the high costs involved in the program suggest that the Taurus Neo will likely feature several enhancements over its predecessor. Two quick points: First, 2029 is obviously a long way off, with even more time until the order is fully completed—if it reaches that scale.Second, funding has yet to be secured, and hopefully, they will manage to source the necessary budget. In my view, this should be an…&mdash; Fabian Hoffmann (@FRHoffmann1) October 25, 2024 The news of Germany’s Taurus Neo plans comes just two days after the signing of a landmark defense agreement between Germany and the United Kingdom, which you can read more about here. The two countries agreed to work together to 'rapidly develop' new extended deep strike weapons. Although no more details were provided, such weapons are planned to fly further and attack targets with greater precision than the Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missile used by the U.K. Royal Air Force. That agreement followed the announcement at the NATO Defense Ministers meeting in Brussels last week that the United Kingdom was joining the European Long-Range Strike Approach (ELSA) initiative, a French-led effort that involves Germany, Poland, and Italy. Previous announcements state that ELSA envisages a missile with a range of between 1,000 and 2,000 kilometers (621 and 1,243 miles) and that it should be in service by the 2030s. The will join the European long-range Strike Approach. Working alongside international allies, including our key ally , we will develop new long range missile capabilities to meet a critical NATO capability priority and bolster European security.#StrongerTogether UK Defence in France (@UKDefenceFrance) October 18, 2024 Exactly how the Taurus Neo would fit into either of these programs is unclear, but it provides more evidence of the growing interest in long-range strike weapons in Europe. The United States and Germany have also announced that U.S. long-range missiles will be stationed in Germany on an 'episodic' basis starting in 2026, including the SM-6 multi-purpose missile and Tomahawk cruise missile as well as 'developmental hypersonic weapons,' which is a likely reference to the Dark Eagle, which is due to be fielded soon, and others. The renewed focus on long-range strike has been driven, above all, by developments in Russian tactical nuclear missiles, which are being fielded in increasingly advanced and long-reaching forms. New types of missiles and new deployments have been accompanied by repeated nuclear threats from President Vladimir Putin as well as suggestions that Russia’s threshold for the potential use of nuclear weapons may have been lowered. The Taurus KEPD 350 is broadly similar to the Storm Shadow and SCALP-EG cruise missiles, which have been supplied to Ukraine by the United Kingdom, France, and Italy. A donated British Storm Shadow cruise missile carried under the wing of a Ukrainian Su-24 strike aircraft. via X Twitter screencap However, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has repeatedly denied requests by Ukraine to supply it with the Taurus. The German government has cited its concerns over Ukraine using the missile to strike targets deep inside Russia. The Storm Shadow and SCALP-EG were supplied to Kyiv on the understanding that they wouldn’t be used for such missions, though there have been reports that these restrictions might have been at least partially relaxed. The fact that Germany has decided it needs air-launched cruise missiles at this point may well also be another factor against Ukraine getting older Taurus KEPD 350 weapons. With a clear demand for weapons in this class, the current stocks of KEPD 350s are only likely to be retained longer, pending the introduction of the Taurus Neo. Of the original 600 Taurus KEPD 350s reported once in the German inventory, as many as half of these are said to be not ready for operational use after their certification expired. Stocks will also have been depleted over the years through examples being expended in tests or exercises, reducing the number that would be available to Ukraine. Should the German Ministry of Defense receive the funds it needs for the Taurus Neo program, it would ensure that the country’s air-launched long-range conventional strike capabilities keep pace with broader developments in air warfare. While it could allow the Taurus KEPD 350 to be phased out, along with the Tornado that carries it, it won’t necessarily see the older missiles approved for transfer to Ukraine, which is something that Berlin has stubbornly resisted so far.

Russians Helped Houthis Target International Shipping: Report	During its nine-month deployment to the Middle East, the USS Dwight D Eisenhower carrier strike group (IKECSG) fired off nearly 800 munitions fending off attacks on its ships and commercial vessels from the Houthis. Now a new report claims Russia gave the Yemeni rebel group targeting data in large measure to keep the U.S. entangled in the region and draw resources and attention away from Moscow's grinding war in Ukraine. The Houthis began attacking shipping in October of 2023 in support of Gaza and 'eventually began using Russian satellite data as they expanded their strikes,' The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. The publication cited 'a person familiar with the matter and two European defense officials.' The data 'was passed through members of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), who were embedded with the Houthis in Yemen,' one of the people told the Journal. Breaking: Russia provided satellite targeting data for Houthi rebels as they attacked Western ships in the Red Sea with missiles and drones earlier this year The Wall Street Journal (@WSJ) October 24, 2024 There is no indication in the Wall Street Journal’s report exactly when the data was supplied or if it contributed to any of the successful attacks on shipping. Regardless, the publication said it highlighted Russian President Vladimir Putin’s interest in undermining what the Pentagon keeps referring to as the U.S.-led 'rules-based order.' Responding to discussions about the U.S. and allies allowing Ukraine to strike deep into Russia with its donated weaponry, Putin threatened to send long-range weapons and military support to 'regions' around the world where they could be used for strikes against Western targets. 'For Russia, any flare-up anywhere is good news, because it takes the world’s attention further away from Ukraine,' Alexander Gabuev, director of Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, a think tank based in Berlin, told WSJ. Houthi attacks on shipping sucked up a lot of U.S. and allied resources. In addition to the IKECSG’s ships and aircraft, several other American and allied sea and air assets took part in defending shipping. They swatted away missiles and drones and blew up uncrewed surface vessels. They also attacked Houthi targets in Yemen. As we reported last week, B-2 Spirit stealth bombers, along with other U.S. forces, conducted a strike on Houthi underground weapon storage sites in Yemen. Land-based aircraft and other assets also took part in the fight. Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro disclosed at a Congressional hearing in April that his service alone had already expended at least $1 billion worth of munitions in operations against the Houthis since October 2023 and in the defense of Israel that month. The Navy was reported to have hit the 100 Standard Missiles fired mark by February of this year. The Dwight D. Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group expended 770 missiles and other munitions at Houthi targets over the course of its nine-month deployment. Capt. Chris 'Chowdah' Hill/USN There were also two international task forces created to defend Red Sea region shipping. The U.S.-led Operation Prosperity Guardian, which The War Zone was the first to write about, was stood up last December. The European-led Operation Aspides launched two months later. Despite all these assets deployed to the region, the Houthis kept up their attacks. Since launching this campaign a year ago, the militants attacked more than 100 ships, sinking two, damaging others, and hijacking another, the Journal noted. The following video shows the November 2023 Houthi hijacking of the Bahamian-flagged Galaxy Leader. NEW VIDEO: Yemen’s Houthi rebels hijack a cargo ship in the Red Sea over the weekend pic.twitter.com/pkkUJpbe5c&mdash; Trey Yingst (@TreyYingst) November 20, 2023 Those attacks disrupted global shipping, forcing companies to shift from passing through the Suez Canal to taking much longer, and more expensive routes around the Cape of Good Hope on the southern tip of Africa. 'Almost 1-in-10 barrels of oil shipped every day worldwide transit through Bab al-Mandab, the strait that separates the Red Sea from the Indian Ocean,' the Journal noted. 'The tanker traffic through that route was 77% lower in August 2024 compared with October 2023, according to Windward, a maritime-intelligence company.' Russian oil tankers have been hit by the Houthis as well, but they are part of a 'ghost fleet' created to circumvent international sanctions. Concerns about Russian assistance to the Houthis go beyond providing targeting data. The U.S. has been worried that Russia could further exacerbate the situation by providing the Houthis with its anti-ship or anti-air missiles as well as other weapons. Those arms could hinder efforts to protect shipping and place U.S. and allied forces at greater risk. However, there is no evidence that such transactions have occurred. Such a move would provide a huge boost to the large arsenal of anti-ship missiles already possessed by the Houthis, who became the first in the world to fire anti-ship ballistic missiles in anger. In addition to helping the Houthis, Russia may also be aiding Hezbollah in its fight against Israel. Last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israeli forces had found 'state-of-the-art' Russian weapons in searches of Hezbollah bases in south Lebanon. However, those weapons could also have been transferred by Iran or obtained by other means. Some of those weapons are on display in the following video.

We reached out to the National Security Council and the Pentagon for comment about the claim that Russia provided the Houthis with targeting data and if so, what they might do in response. We will update this story with any pertinent information provided.

Marines Testing Counter-Drone Rifle Aiming System With Automatica...	The U.S. Marines are testing a system for standard service rifles that automatically fine-tunes the point of aim with the help of a powered buttstock as a new option to help shoot down drones. The service is in the midst of a broad push to acquire new capabilities to help every Marine better protect themselves from ever-growing uncrewed aerial threats. The 3rd Marine Division in Hawaii released pictures today from a live-fire demonstration of a 5.56x45mm M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle (IAR) equipped with the ZeroMark Fire Control System (FCS). ZeroMark is a New York-based startup that was founded in 2022 and that says it has 'deep roots in Israel.' The company announced a new infusion of $7 million in venture capital funding to support the ongoing development of its counter-drone FCS back in May. A Marine fires an M27 IAR equipped with the ZeroMark FCS during a recent live-fire demonstration in Hawaii. USMC 'The ZeroMark FCS is an AI [artificial intelligence]-powered tool that enhances aim accuracy and counter-drone capabilities, providing Marines with a portable, real-time threat detection and response tool,' a caption for one of the pictures from the 3rd Marine Division says. C-UAS in soldiers’ hands.AI-powered accuracy.It’s coming. pic.twitter.com/hh38ON9Lfa&mdash; ZeroMark (@zeromarkinc) November 16, 2023 ZeroMark's system is not the first automated small arms targeting system the Marines have looked into in recent years with a particular eye toward helping engage drones. The service has also at least been evaluating SMASH 2000-series computerized optical sights from Israeli firm Smart Shooter. SMASH-series sights have the ability to detect and lock onto targets of interest, even ones on the move, and calculate an optimal aim point for the shooter. Depending on how the system is configured on a particular gun, it can even prevent the trigger from being pulled until the weapon is properly aimed at the target. The targeting system in ZeroMark's FCS is similar, in some very broad strokes, to that of the SMASH family. It uses an array of sensors, including electro-optical cameras and LIDAR, coupled with machine vision and advanced software algorithms, to acquire targets, according to the company. Where ZeroMark's offering differs most substantially is in its motorized articulating buttstock, which uses the data from the sensors to help physically move the gun's point of aim. This, in turn, helps the shooter engage the target with greater precision and speed. Screen captures from a ZeroMark promotional video seen earlier in this story showing how the buttstock is designed to articulate vertically (for evaluation) and laterally (for windage). ZeroMark captures '[The mechanized buttstock] doesn’t move the soldier’s arm, it creates a virtual pivot between shoulder pad and handheld positions that creates angular change of the bore axis (ultimately where the gun’s pointed),' ZeroMark CEO Joel Anderson said in an interview earlier this year, according to TechCrunch. 'The control systems for it are modeled to compensate for all the human factors (proprioception, noise, movement, torque, etc.) as well as the drone’s movement. So if you point in the general direction of the drone such that you’d be in the vicinity of a drone, the system does the rest.' Zeromark says it is also easy to install and uninstall as required on a wide variety of different rifle types. A promotional video seen earlier in this story shows prototypes or mock-ups of the system installed on rifles in the AK-47/AKM, AR-15/M16, and Tavor families, as seen below. ZeroMark captures Overall, ZeroMark says its FCS 'makes hitting a small drone at 200 yards as easy as hitting a 60-foot-diameter circle' at the same range, per TechCrunch. At least for now, the company has said work on its targeting system is focused on the counter-drone role, but has acknowledged that its system could be adapted for use against a wider array of target types in the future. The Marine Corps' interest in new ways to neutralize drones that it can add to its existing rifles and other small arms is certainly no secret. The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) put out a broad request for information (RFI) back in July that included a call for proposals for 'a rifle / rifle optic capable of tracking and defeating small UAS [uncrewed aerial systems],' as well as rifle-mounted electronic warfare jammers, specialized ammunition types, and other counter-small UAS (CsUAS) capabilities. 'The Joint CsUAS Office (JCO) has identified dismounted CsUAS capabilities as a vulnerability to the joint force. The Marine Corps Warfighting Lab (MCWL) identified the need for dismounted CsUAS throughout multiple experiments,' the RFI explained. 'Additionally, Tactical Training and Exercise Control Group (TTECG), Infantry Officer Course (IOC), both Schools of Infantry (SOI), and other units continue to fly threat UAS against Marine units during field exercises and training events. Each experiment and training exercise shows Marines are vulnerable to threat UAS and require the ability to defend themselves from the threat.' A US Marine with a standard M27 IAR. USMC This followed the Corps unveiling a three-tier plan to improve the ability of units at all levels to shield themselves from drones earlier this year. 'The threat is evolving in real time,' Lt. Col. Robert Barclay, the Marines’ ground-based air defense advisor for aviation expeditionary enablers, said at the Modern Day Marine expo in May. 'We were playing a cat-and-mouse game a lot of times, and that quite frankly gets a little cumbersome, and you don’t want to be behind the power curve.' The threat posed by various tiers of uncrewed aerial systems, including highly maneuverable first-person view (FPV) types turned into kamikaze drones and other weaponized commercial designs capable of dropping small improvised munitions, is not new. This is something The War Zone routinely highlights and the threat ecosystem looks to be on the verge of taking another major step forward thanks in large part to advances in artificial intelligence. The ongoing war in Ukraine, where both sides employ FPV and other drone types on a daily basis, has been especially central to finally thrusting the reality of drone threats into the mainstream consciousness. A global explosion of demand for counter-drone capabilities, including ones that individual personnel can carry, has followed.

Whether Marines or any other part of the U.S. armed forces ultimately adopts ZeroMark's FCS remains to be seen, but capabilities to help individual shooters engage drones and other targets faster and more accurately are increasingly becoming a top prioritiy.

U.S. Pushes Back On Claim Israel Delaying Iran Attack Over Docume...	The U.S. is pushing back against a claim made by The Times of London that Israel is delaying its expected retaliation strike against Iran because of the leak of a U.S. assessment of its war plans. 'We have no indication that Israel is delaying any action because of the document leak,' a U.S. official told The War Zone Thursday morning. 'Would steer you away from that.' Top secret documents leaked from the U.S. National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA) appeared last week on a pro-Iranian Telegram channel. They offered details about Israel’s advanced preparations for a large-scale strike in retaliation for the Oct. 1 Iranian missile barrage. The U.S. has not disputed their authenticity. It is possible Iran has obtained other documents not yet disclosed and it could signify a longer-term leak of information that remains unquantified, at least publicly. 'The leak of the American documents delayed the attack due to the need to change certain strategies and components,' an 'intelligence source with knowledge of Israeli deliberations' told The Times of London. 'There will be a retaliation, but it has taken longer than it was supposed to take.' Many factors can play into a military operation's timeline, especially an unprecedented one that would be highly complex and stretch Israel's long-range strike abilities. More basic elements are also important, including weather and moon states that are favorable to the operation and NEW: Israel has delayed its retaliatory strike against Iran because of a leak last week of potentially sensitive military information from the US The Times and The Sunday Times (@thetimes) October 24, 2024 Israel 'is concerned the leak could help Iran predict certain patterns of attack,' according to the publication. 'It has been forced to develop an alternative plan, one that requires detailed war gaming before any order is given, The Times understands.' The Netanyahu government has told the U.S. it won't strike Iran's nuclear facilities or oil infrastructure, the Washington Post reported. Instead, it will likely strike military targets. The Biden administration is working feverishly to tamp down tensions. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday that Israel's retaliation should not lead to greater escalation. Unlike the last rounds of attacks the two nations carried out against each other, an Israeli strike against Iran is likely to receive a quick response, setting off what could be a prolonged direct conflict between the long-time enemies.

More than 1,200 Israelis were killed in that attack and more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed during Israel's massive military response. Blinken said Israel had accomplished its objective of 'effectively dismantling' Hamas, and that negotiations over a cease-fire and the release of dozens of Israeli hostages would resume in the coming days, The Associated Press reported. Speaking to reporters in Qatar, which has served as a key mediator between Israel and Hamas, Bliken said negotiators would reconvene 'in the coming days,' AP reported. 'What we really have to determine is whether Hamas is prepared to engage,' he said on his 11th visit to the region since the start of the war. The U.S. 'hopes to renew the negotiations after Israeli forces killed top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza last week, but neither side has shown any sign of moderating its demands from months of negotiations that sputtered to a halt over the summer,' the wire service stated. Blinken also announced an additional $135 million in U.S. aid to the Palestinians, while again urging Israel to allow more assistance to enter the territory.

The Associated Press (@AP) October 24, 2024 Al Jazeera said it conducted an investigation showing the extent to which the U.S. and U.K. have gone in support of Israel. The news outlet said an analysis of open-source flight tracking data showed over 6,000 military flights in a year, with hundreds transporting arms to Israel. Israel conducted only 20% of the 1,600 reconnaissance flights, while the U.K. was responsible for nearly half using Shadow R1 surveillance aircraft. The U.K. also provided targeting data during 645 flights. 'More than 1,200 military cargo flights made up the airlift over a year several bases in Europe were used with hundreds of flights from each from the UK, Germany, Italy, Cyprus and Greece,' Al Jazeera claimed. 'It is this air bridge, together with a vast number of surveillance flights and air-to-air refueling that has sustained Israel's brutal war on Gaza and how to expand its operations into southern Lebanon.' The U.K. MoD said it is not participating in the Israel-Hamas war. 'Our mandate is narrowly defined to focus on securing the release of the hostages only, including British nationals, with the RAF routinely conducting unarmed flights since December 2023 for this sole purpose,' the MoD told us in a statement. 'As a matter of principle, we only provide intelligence to our allies where we are satisfied that it will be used in accordance with International Humanitarian Law, and in this instance only information relating to hostage rescue is passed to the Israeli authorities.' The surveillance flights in question 'only operate over Israel, Gaza and in international airspace and all data collected is solely used to support hostage rescue,' according to the MoD. 'No RAF flights have transported lethal cargo to the Israeli Defence Forces. We will not comment further on detailed intelligence matters to protect operational security.'

'It has been forced to develop an alternative plan, one that requires detailed war gaming before any order is given, The Times understands.' The Netanyahu government has told the U.S. it won't strike Iran's nuclear facilities or oil infrastructure, the Washington Post reported. Instead, it will likely strike military targets. The Biden administration is working feverishly to tamp down tensions. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday that Israel's retaliation should not lead to greater escalation. Unlike the last rounds of attacks the two nations carried out against each other, an Israeli strike against Iran is likely to receive a quick response, setting off what could be a prolonged direct conflict between the long-time enemies.

More than 1,200 Israelis were killed in that attack and more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed during Israel's massive military response. Blinken said Israel had accomplished its objective of 'effectively dismantling' Hamas, and that negotiations over a cease-fire and the release of dozens of Israeli hostages would resume in the coming days, The Associated Press reported. Speaking to reporters in Qatar, which has served as a key mediator between Israel and Hamas, Bliken said negotiators would reconvene 'in the coming days,' AP reported. 'What we really have to determine is whether Hamas is prepared to engage,' he said on his 11th visit to the region since the start of the war. The U.S. 'hopes to renew the negotiations after Israeli forces killed top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza last week, but neither side has shown any sign of moderating its demands from months of negotiations that sputtered to a halt over the summer,' the wire service stated. Blinken also announced an additional $135 million in U.S. aid to the Palestinians, while again urging Israel to allow more assistance to enter the territory.

The Associated Press (@AP) October 24, 2024 Al Jazeera said it conducted an investigation showing the extent to which the U.S. and U.K. have gone in support of Israel. The news outlet said an analysis of open-source flight tracking data showed over 6,000 military flights in a year, with hundreds transporting arms to Israel. Israel conducted only 20% of the 1,600 reconnaissance flights, while the U.K. was responsible for nearly half using Shadow R1 surveillance aircraft. The U.K. also provided targeting data during 645 flights. 'More than 1,200 military cargo flights made up the airlift over a year several bases in Europe were used with hundreds of flights from each from the UK, Germany, Italy, Cyprus and Greece,' Al Jazeera claimed. 'It is this air bridge, together with a vast number of surveillance flights and air-to-air refueling that has sustained Israel's brutal war on Gaza and how to expand its operations into southern Lebanon.' The U.K. MoD said it is not participating in the Israel-Hamas war. 'Our mandate is narrowly defined to focus on securing the release of the hostages only, including British nationals, with the RAF routinely conducting unarmed flights since December 2023 for this sole purpose,' the MoD told us in a statement. 'As a matter of principle, we only provide intelligence to our allies where we are satisfied that it will be used in accordance with International Humanitarian Law, and in this instance only information relating to hostage rescue is passed to the Israeli authorities.' The surveillance flights in question 'only operate over Israel, Gaza and in international airspace and all data collected is solely used to support hostage rescue,' according to the MoD. 'No RAF flights have transported lethal cargo to the Israeli Defence Forces. We will not comment further on detailed intelligence matters to protect operational security.'

'These provide unequivocal proof that these individuals serve as military operatives for the terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip.' They 'serve as proof of the integration of Hamas terrorists within the Qatari Al Jazeera media network,' the IDF added. 'Most of the journalists that the IDF has exposed as operatives in Hamas's military wing spearhead the propaganda for Hamas at Al Jazeera, especially in the northern Gaza Strip.' The War Zone cannot independently verify the veracity of those documents. 'Al Jazeera has strongly rejected a claim by the Israeli military that six of its journalists based in Gaza are members of the Palestinian groups Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ),' the network said in response to the allegations.

B-21 Raider Fleet Size Under Review	The expected size of the U.S. Air Force's B-21 Raider fleet could change as part of an ongoing force structure review, according to the bomber's manufacturer Northrop Grumman. The company is also expecting to get another B-21 low-rate production contract by the end of the year, which follows steadily progressing ground and flight testing work. Kathy Warden, Northrop Grumman's CEO, talked about the present state of the B-21 program and her company's expectations for the future during a quarterly earnings call earlier today. The Air Force's publicly stated plan has long been to buy at least 100 Raiders, but there have been discussions for years now about the possibility of the service acquiring significantly more of the bombers. 'I think that's exactly what the Air Force is looking at,' Warden said. 'They are undertaking a force structure design review and the Secretary [of the Air Force Frank Kendall] has been open about looking at the various options they have for increasing their force size, and has talked specifically about NGAD, and we know that B-21 is in the mix, as well.' Warden was responding to a question about how any fallout from the Air Force's reassessment of its plans for a new crewed sixth-generation stealth 'fighter' as part of the larger Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative might impact the B-21 and other programs. The NGAD combat jet effort's future is now very uncertain amid a deep re-examination of what the aircraft might be expected to do as a part of efforts to drive down costs, as you can read more about here. Broader concerns about the outlook for U.S. defense budgets in the coming years, as well as increasing costs for other top-priority efforts, especially the ballooning price of the LGM-35A Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile program, have also factored into the NGAD review. Northrop Grumman notably voluntarily withdrew from the competition to develop the NGAD combat jet, at least as a prime contractor, last year. A rendering of various existing advanced Northrop Grumman aircraft designs and future concepts, including a notional crewed stealth combat aircraft at left. Northrop Grumman 'It would be premature for me to suggest where that force structure review will end up,' Warden added during the call today. 'I do think in the coming months, we may get a better indication from the Air Force as to how they're thinking about B-21 quantities in the long run.' The War Zone has reached out to the Air Force for more information. New questions about the Air Force's expected B-21 fleet size had already emerged earlier this year. Gen. David Allvin, the service's Chief of Staff, caused a stir at a Congressional hearing in April when he declined to commit to buying more than 100 Raiders and talked about his service already looking to future capabilities to augment the bombers. A key known requirement for the B-21 already is the ability to operate in a pilot-optional mode. 'It [the B-21] certainly is the future of our bomber force. … 100 is the program of record,' Allvin said at the time. 'I think we’re not going to reach that number until probably the mid-2030s and beyond. And before we commit to that as being the platform beyond that, I think there are other technological advancements that we would see to be able to augment that and have a better mix.' The War Zone has previously explored in detail how the Air Force looking beyond the B-21 now makes good sense. The air combat realities that the entire U.S. military has to contend with continue to rapidly evolve, especially when it comes to future planning around a potential high-end fight, such as one in the Pacific against China. Advances in the uncrewed aviation and artificial and machine learning sectors are particularly significant factors in these broader developments. Photo courtesy of Jonathan Case, Northrop Grumman It is worth noting here that there is the potential that a review of the B-21 force structure plans, especially in relation to what could happen with the NGAD combat jet, might actually lead to an increase in Raider acquisitions. The possibility of B-21s, or a variant or derivative of that design, supporting NGAD-related air dominance missions is something The War Zone and Air Force officials have raised in the past. 'In the short run, we may remain very focused on delivering them optionality, the performance that we are delivering gives them a capability that is in production now that is well below the cost targets for the platform, and we believe that that's the role of industry to get the government options as they think about their force structure,' Northrop Grumman's Warden also said during today's earnings call. Northrop Grumman has delivered at least one of six pre-production B-21s and has begun work on the first low-rate initial production (LRIP) lot of Raiders. The company is expecting to get a contract for the second LRIP lot in the fourth quarter of 2024. 'We have no change to pricing,' Warden said today. 'We are continuing to perform&#8230; in alignment with the plan that we have laid out for the B-21 and I'm very proud of that team. It's quite a remarkable accomplishment.' In January, Northrop Grumman had disclosed a loss of nearly $1.2 billion on the B-21 program and its expectation that it would take a financial hit on each of the first five LRIP lots. 'Macroeconomic disruptions,' which could include higher-than-expected inflation and other broader economic factors, were cited as the cause of the losses. Though the exact current estimated unit cost of the Raider is unknown, Northrop Grumman continues to say it is under the Air Force's target of $550 million in Fiscal Year 2010 dollars, or around $793 million when adjusted for inflation. The first pre-production B-21 landing at Edwards Air Force Base in California after a flight test. USAF 'The B-21 program has also made solid progress in achieving ground and flight testing milestones on the development contract, and is continuing to execute the aircraft production contract in line with our estimates,' Warden added today. Northrop Grumman and the Air Force had already provided a substantial update on B-21 testing activities, including work using two non-flying ground test articles, around the Air & Space Forces Association's main annual conference back in September. Officials at that time highlighted how the tempo of flight testing using the initial pre-production Raider had increased to two flights per week. The Air Force's publicly stated goal remains to begin fielding B-21s operationally before 2030, with Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota slated to be the first base to host combat-coded Raider squadrons. Additional B-21 squadrons are set to be based at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, the current home of the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber fleet, and Dyess Air Force Base in Texas. There are now new questions about exactly what the full B-21 force layout might look like, even as testing and initial production of the bombers are expanding.

Poland’s F-16s Cleared For Major Upgrades	Poland has taken the next step in the modernization of its air force, with U.S. approval given for a major upgrade of its fleet of F-16 fighters. The program will bring the jets to the F-16V standard and also suggests new weapons may be introduced, too. The Viper Midlife Upgrade is announced as Poland awaits F-35s and considers buying F-15EXs, while making significant investments in its armed forces across the board, to meet the threat from Russia. As is typically the case for major U.S. arms sales, the Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) announced the State Department’s approval of the F-16 package for Poland yesterday. Poland’s Viper Midlife Upgrade would be valued at around $7.3 billion. Under the proposed deal, the full fleet of 48 Polish Air Force F-16C/D Block 52+ jets would be upgraded, receiving a considerable boost in capabilities. A Polish Air Force F-16C with conformal fuel tanks (CFTs) fitted. Polish Air Force Polish Armed Forces/Piotr Łysakowski It is important to stress that approved foreign arms sales announced through DSCA are not final and are subject to change, including as a result of negotiations between the country in question and relevant defense contractors. Nevertheless, at the center of the upgrade is the Northrop Grumman AN/APG-83 active Scalable Agile Beam Radars (SABR), an electronically scanned array (AESA) radar which you can read more about in detail here. A Northrop Grumman AN/APG-83 SABR radar installed on an F-16. U.S. Air Force USAF / Bobbi Zapka This will be combined with a new Modular Mission Computer as well as a Next Generation Mission Computer or equivalent. The pilots will be provided with Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing Systems (JHMCS II), an upgraded and improved version of the original JHMCS that Poland already uses. Other avionics include Embedded Global Positioning System (GPS) Inertial Navigation Systems (INS), AN/APX-126/127 Advanced Identification Friend or Foe (AIFF) with combined interrogator/transponder, and AN/ARC-238 radios (or equivalent). In terms of self-protection equipment, the upgraded F-16s would be fitted with either the AN/ALQ-254V(1) Viper Shield or AN/ALQ-257 Integrated Viper Electronic Warfare Suite (IVEWS), which aligns with reports earlier this year that Northrop Grumman and L3Harris were facing off to provide the central electronic warfare component of an expected upgrade package for the Polish jets. Other self-protection gear outlined by the DCSA announcement comprises Passive Airborne Warning System (PAWS-2) missile warning systems and AN/ALE-47 countermeasures dispensers. The offensive weapons outlined in the package are all test and training versions and comprise three AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) captive-carry flight test vehicles, three GBU-53/B Small Diameter Bomb II (SDB II) guided test vehicles, eight SDB II captive-carry reliability trainers, and two GBU-39(T-1)/B Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) guided test vehicles. Notably, neither the GBU-39/B nor the GBU-53/B, the latter of which is also known as the StormBreaker, are currently in the Polish arsenal. There are also two AIM-9X Block II Sidewinder special air training missiles and two AIM-9X captive air training missiles. A U.S. Air Force F-16D carrying a load of StormBreakers during a test. Raytheon F-16D carrying a load of StormBreakers during a test. (Raytheon) With no operational weaponry included so far, these stores will be used for developmental test of the F-16V for Poland. They provide a fairly good indication of some of the munitions that are likely to be procured by the Polish Air Force in the future. The DSCA statement on the approved sale also references MS-110 reconnaissance pods, although the number is not disclosed. Polish F-16s already fly with the dual-band DB-110 tactical reconnaissance pod, the precursor to the current MS-110, which adds a multi-spectral imaging (MSI) capability. 'The F-16 Viper mid-life upgrade will bolster Poland’s air defense and surveillance capabilities, support national security, and strengthen Poland’s defense and contributions to NATO,' the DSCA states. No timelines for Poland’s potential Viper Midlife Upgrade were announced. Upgrading the F-16 — known locally as the Jastrzab, or Hawk — makes a lot of sense for Poland, with the 48 examples (36 single-seat F-16Cs and 12 two-seat F-16Ds) set to be Poland’s most important combat aircraft for some time to come. These fighters currently serve with three squadrons, two of them based in Poznan-Krzesiny and one at Łask. These aircraft are already highly capable and among the most potent F-16s of any NATO operator. A Polish F-16 preparing for a night flight at Trapani Air Base, Italy, during the Trident Juncture 15 exercise. Antonio Valentino/Wikimedia Commons OR9 Antonio VALENTINO_ITA_AF_50th Wing Piacenza The jets can be configured with conformal fuel tanks (CFTs) and are armed with AIM-120C-5/7 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) and AIM-9X Sidewinder that can be fired off-boresight using the JHMCS. Current offensive stores include the AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missile, AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW), and AGM-158A/B Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), as well as Paveway laser-guided bombs, and Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM). The aircraft are fitted with Sniper targeting pods. Once upgraded, Poland’s F-16s will remain highly viable until the F-35s become fully operationally capable and will be able to fight alongside those jets after. Furthermore, as has been pointed out in the past, the F-16V upgrade should also help the Polish Air Force integrate the F-35, with some significant commonality in terms of avionics, especially the radars. The urgency of keeping the Polish fighter force at the top of its game — through new acquisitions and modernization programs — has been driven by the changing security situation in Eastern Europe, especially since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. This has accelerated plans to replace Poland’s Cold War-era fleet of Soviet-made MiG-29 Fulcrum and Su-22 Fitter combat aircraft. A pair of Polish MIG-29s take part in a NATO exercise at Łask Air Base, Poland, in October 2022. Photo by Omar Marques/Getty Images Omar Marques Today, just 14 MiG-29s remain in service, after the transfer of a similar number to Ukraine in 2023, to restock its Fulcrum fleet that has been ravaged during the war with Russia. Poland is expected to retire its last MiG-29s in 2027. Meanwhile, the last of the aging Su-22 Fitter swing-wing ground-attack/strike aircraft are now scheduled for withdrawal next year. The new security situation has also led to Poland considering the possibility of arming its future F-35s with U.S. B61-12 thermonuclear bombs in the future, as you can read about here. Outfitting F-16s with these weapons also remains a possibility, although the stealth fighter offers many more advantages in the nuclear strike role. Poland will start to receive its new fifth-generation fighters soon. The first F-35A from an order for 32 was officially rolled out in August in a ceremony at Lockheed Martin’s Fort Worth, Texas plant. The first pair of F-35s — locally named Husarz, or Hussar — are scheduled to be delivered in December. Poland’s first F-35A was officially rolled out on August 28 in a ceremony at Lockheed Martin’s Fort Worth, Texas plant. Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin There is also the possibility that Poland might further increase its fighter inventory, adding another new type in the shape of the F-15EX, the latest version of the Eagle. Boeing made an announcement about its pitch to sell an unspecified number of F-15EXs to Poland in September last year, as we wrote about at the time. As we noted then, even a relatively small F-15EX buy could be very useful for Poland, providing a platform with some niche capabilities that the F-16 and the F-35 can’t necessarily provide. In particular, the Eagle II offers significantly greater range and payload capacity that could be particularly useful for Poland when it comes to protecting the country’s airspace, where stealth would not necessarily be as critical, and increasing its capacity to conduct standoff strikes against surface targets. The ability to carry future hypersonic weapons could also be attractive as Poland seeks to further develop its long-range strike capabilities. A U.S. Air Force F-15EX armed with 12 AIM-120 AMRAAMs. U.S. Air Force SSgt. Blake Wiles Poland has also recently introduced yet another warplane, the South Korea-made FA-50 light combat aircraft. In July last year, Warsaw signed an agreement with Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) to buy 48 FA-50s, as part of a huge arms transfer from South Korea to Poland. The jets are being rapidly delivered to backfill combat aircraft numbers after the transfer of 14 MiG-29s to Ukraine and the forthcoming retirement of the Su-22. To speed up the deliveries, Poland is receiving the FA-50s in two discrete configurations. The first 12 FA-50s, in Block 10 standard, were delivered to Poland in mid-2023. The next batch of 36 aircraft will be in the more advanced Block 20 configuration, including active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, Sniper targeting pod, Link 16 datalink, and AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles. Deliveries of the Block 20 aircraft are due to begin next year. Recently, there has been some criticism of the FA-50 buy and, especially, the lack of certain weapons for these aircraft. Mariusz Blaszczak, Poland’s Minister of National Defense during the presentation of the first FA-50 for the Poland, at Minsk Mazowiecki Air Base, Poland, on August 21, 2023. Photo by Foto Olimpik/NurPhoto via Getty Images NurPhoto NurPhoto In a parliamentary speech last month, Poland’s Deputy Minister of Defense Cezary Tomczyk derided the FA-50s as 'a training-combat aircraft that is for training but not for combat.' The main point of concern is the integration of AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles, which were expected for the Block 20 version, but which KAI now says could take much longer — if it’s even feasible. '[AMRAAM integration] requires U.S. approval,' Chongho Yoon, the vice president of KAI, told Defense24.com. 'A feasibility study is underway; all is to happen in three to four years. Technically this is doable, but other areas need to be addressed. KAI is currently working on such research and the matter is to be clarified in two to three years.' Whether or not the FA-50s eventually receive AMRAAM, they will at least benefit from being compatible with other weapons used by the F-16. Should Poland buy more weapons for its upgraded Vipers, these could also be used to arm the FA-50 fleet. Polish F-16s with Sniper pods on their engine intakes. Photo by RADOSLAW JOZWIAK/AFP via Getty Images RADOSLAW JOZWIAK As well as new combat aircraft, Poland is also investing in its broader air defense architecture, notably receiving U.S. approval to purchase elements of a new airborne early warning system based on an aerostat — a type of uncrewed tethered airship. You can read more about that intriguing project, which has parallels with the canceled American system known as JLENS, in this previous article. While not unexpected, the announcement of the proposed Viper upgrade for Poland is yet more evidence of the country’s efforts to strengthen its air force as it seeks to provide a more effective deterrent to possible Russian aggression as well as a more capable bulwark should Moscow make a move against Poland or another NATO state in the region, something that officials are increasingly concerned about. This military expansion is reflected across the Polish Armed Forces and has been aided by a hike in defense expenditure, with Warsaw now spending 4.23 percent of its GDP on its armed forces, more than double the NATO target of two percent. The All in all, Poland’s increasingly powerful air force reflects the country’s defense-spending spree, as fears of Russian aggression grow in the wake of the all-out invasion of Ukraine. With Poland spending 4.23 percent of its GDP on its armed forces, more than double the NATO target of two percent, the forthcoming F-35 fleet will be one of the most potent — and capable — symbols of the country’s rapid military modernization.

French Mirage 2000s Destined For Ukraine Will Fly With Storm Shad...	France announced it will deliver three of its Dassault Mirage 2000 multi-role aircraft to Ukraine in the first half of 2025, according to the Ukrainian Defense Post news outlet, citing French media. It is the first tranche of an undisclosed number of the jets France said it will give to Ukraine. 'The Mirage 2000s that will be delivered to Ukraine will be equipped with new equipment,' French Armed Forces Minister Sébastien Lecornu said in an interview with Bordeaux-based news agency Sud Ouest,' Defense Post reported. 'This transformation operation will take place at the Cazaux base in Gironde. The aim is to equip them with air-to-ground combat capabilities and strengthen their electronic warfare system.' Three French Mirage 2000 fighters are scheduled to arrive in Ukraine by next March. (Photo by ludovic MARIN / AFP) (Photo by LUDOVIC MARIN/AFP via Getty Images) As we suggested back in June, it's now confirmed that the jets will be armed with versions of the MICA beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile, as well as the stealthy SCALP-EG cruise missile and the Hammer rocket-assisted precision-guided bomb, according to the French La Tribune news outlet. This is in addition to their 30mm cannons. 'But the most important thing is the training of pilots and mechanics, which is continuing in Nancy,' Lecornu added. An unknown number of Mirage 2000s are being upgraded right now for Ukraine, which will also include enhancements to their electronic warfare suite. Earlier this month, we reported that France announced details of its plans to put surplus Mirage fighters into Ukrainian hands. The delta-winged jet is set to become the second Western-made fighter to be provided to Kyiv, following the F-16, the first of which arrived in Ukraine this summer. The Latest On the battlefield, Russian troops have recently made limited advances in Kursk and eastern Ukraine, but the two sides are largely logged in a stalemate across much of the 800-mile front lines, according to the latest assessment from the Institute for the Study of War (IWS).

'Geolocated footage published on October 21 indicates that Russian forces advanced in fields south of Sheptukhovka (southeast of Korenevo) during two platoon-sized mechanized assaults,' ISW stated. Kharkiv: Russian forces continued limited offensive operations in northern Kharkiv Oblast on October 22 but did not make any confirmed advances. Luhansk: Russian forces continued offensive operations along the Kupyansk-Svatove-Kreminna line on October 22, but did not make any confirmed advances. Donetsk: Russian forces recently advanced east of Kurakhove and southwest of Donetsk City near Vuhledar. However, there were no changes to the front lines near Pokrovsk, southeast of Siversk, or near Chasiv Yar and Toretsk. Zaporizhzhia: Russian forces continued assaults northeast of Robotyne near Mala Tokmachka on October 21 and 22, but there were no confirmed advances. Kherson: Russian forces continued attacks on the eastern bank of the Dnipro RIvert on October 21 but did not make any confirmed advances.

It is the first tranche of an undisclosed number of the jets France said it will give to Ukraine. 'The Mirage 2000s that will be delivered to Ukraine will be equipped with new equipment,' French Armed Forces Minister Sébastien Lecornu said in an interview with Bordeaux-based news agency Sud Ouest,' Defense Post reported. 'This transformation operation will take place at the Cazaux base in Gironde. The aim is to equip them with air-to-ground combat capabilities and strengthen their electronic warfare system.' Three French Mirage 2000 fighters are scheduled to arrive in Ukraine by next March. (Photo by ludovic MARIN / AFP) (Photo by LUDOVIC MARIN/AFP via Getty Images) As we suggested back in June, it's now confirmed that the jets will be armed with versions of the MICA beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile, as well as the stealthy SCALP-EG cruise missile and the Hammer rocket-assisted precision-guided bomb, according to the French La Tribune news outlet. This is in addition to their 30mm cannons. 'But the most important thing is the training of pilots and mechanics, which is continuing in Nancy,' Lecornu added. An unknown number of Mirage 2000s are being upgraded right now for Ukraine, which will also include enhancements to their electronic warfare suite. Earlier this month, we reported that France announced details of its plans to put surplus Mirage fighters into Ukrainian hands.

But they are also so close together it is something of a liability because one interceptor could potentially take out multiple craft.

New Ways To Stretch F/A-18 Super Hornet’s Range Sought By Navy	The U.S. Navy is asking for new ideas about how to increase the unrefueled range of its F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighters and EA-18G Growler electronic warfare aircraft. The service axed plans to give its Super Hornets range-extending conformal fuel tanks (CFT) nearly four years ago, citing technical and other issues. The Navy's MQ-25 Stingray tanker drone program has also experienced significant delays, as well as cost growth. Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) put out a contracting notice asking for information about potential 'innovative concepts' for extending the range of its Super Hornet and Growler fleets earlier today. From top to bottom, an F/A-18E, an F/A-18F, and an EA-18G. Boeing 'The intent of this RFI [request for information] is to provide&#8230; initial insight into the existence of such concepts, their potential capability to extend platform range, how the concept could be integrated into naval TACAIR [tactical aircraft], and any considerations with respect to reliability and suitability for carrier-based flight operations,' the notice says. 'It is meant to provide respondents with broad latitude to submit concepts across multiple engineering disciplines that could provide extended range capability.' 'Example areas these concepts may address include, but are NOT limited to, methods to increase lift, reduce drag, increase fuel available, reduce fuel usage on the deck, increase engine performance; and/or adjustments to subsystem integration and/or architecture or advanced flight controls,' it adds. NAVAIR's website puts the F/A-18E/F's maximum combat range at 1,275 nautical miles (2,346 kilometers), but with a loadout of just two AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. Boeing, the Super Hornet's manufacturer, has said in the past that the jet's range is around 1,188 nautical miles (2,200 kilometers) when carrying two AIM-9X Sidewinders, two AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM), two 2,000-pound-class precision-guided bombs, and a 480-gallon drop tank on the centerline station. The EA-18G's combat range when carrying three AN/ALQ-99 jamming pods, two AIM-120s, two radar-busting AGM-88-series missiles, and two 480-gallon drop tanks is over 850 nautical miles (1,574 kilometers), per NAVAIR. An EA-18G carrying three AN/ALQ-99 pods and a pair of drop tanks, as well as an Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation (ACMI) pod under its right wing. USN As already noted, Boeing has developed CFTs for the F/A-18E/F offering greater range and performance over loadouts using traditional draggy drop tanks. The two conformal tanks, designed to be installed on either side of the Super Hornet's spine on top of the jets’ center 'barrel' section, can hold 515 gallons of fuel in total. The company has previously said the tanks could extend the range of Super Hornet loaded with a pair of AIM-9Xs, a pair of AIM-120s, a pair of 2,000-pound precision-guided bombs, and the centerline drop tank, to 1,428 nautical miles (close to 2,645 kilometers). The CFTs could also free up the stations previously taken up by drop tanks for other stores. Boeing The Navy had originally planned to include the CFTs along with other improvements on new-production Block III Super Hornets and older jets brought up to that standard – an upgrade effort that is still underway. There had also been the potential for adding the CFTs to the EA-18Gs down the line. A Navy F/A-18F with conformal fuel tanks (CFT) installed during testing. USN However, in January 2021, the Navy halted work on the CFTs for the Super Hornet citing, in part, still largely unexplained technical hurdles tied in some way to carrier-based operations, as you can read more about here. Cost growth and delays were also a factor. It is certainly possible that the Navy could now revisit the matter of CFTs. At least new-production Block III Super Hornets all still have provisions for the ones Boeing has designed already. New, low-drag drop tanks might be another option. NAVAIR's mention of 'increase engine performance' as another possible avenue to increasing F/A-18E/F and EA-18G range recalls previous discussions about re-engining the jets. An Enhanced Performance Engine (EPE) configuration of the existing General Electric F414s that power Super Hornets and Growlers now has been proposed in the past. The F414-EPE was projected to offer a 20 percent increase in thrust (which could translate to greater range) and a one percent reduction in fuel burn rate. A look at the specifications of the previously proposed F414-EPE engine. General Electric How cost-effective and otherwise viable any other potential changes to the jet's physical structures, including the placement of subsystems, another potential range-extending avenue NAVAIR mentioned in its contracting notice today, might be is unclear. The Navy's existing Super Hornets have already been going through costly and time-consuming life-extension and upgrade programs in recent years. New-production jets are rolling off a line Boeing plans to shutter completely in 2027. At the same time, relatively small individual efficiency gains from more modest changes, such as vortex generators and drag-reducing techniques, coupled with improved computer-controlled flight systems and new tactics, techniques, and procedures, could all up when it comes to fuel economy and range. What is clear is that the Navy still has a significant interest in finding on-aircraft ways to extend the range of its F/A-18E/Fs and EA-18Gs. This comes amid an expanding air defense and anti-ship threat ecosystem that presents growing challenges to carrier-based aircraft and the ships in carrier strike groups. China's ever-more-capable arsenal of air-to-air, surface-to-air, and anti-ship missiles, as well as other anti-access and area-denial capabilities, is of particular concern to the U.S. military. This reality can only contribute to lengthening distances between where carriers will have to launch their aircraft to reduce vulnerability and where those planes are expected to operate. We have already seen this translate to significant aviation-related developments within the Navy, particularly the development and now fielding on at least a limited level of the AIM-174B air-launched derivative of the multi-purpose Standard Missile-6 (SM-6), which you can read more about here. F/A-18E/Fs are currently the only known launch platform for the notably large, heavy, and draggy AIM-174Bs, underscoring the value of new range-extending option, especially as alternatives to traditional drop tanks. Super Hornets are also set to be at least the initial launch platform for the Navy's Hypersonic Air-Launched Offensive Anti-Surface Warfare (HALO) hypersonic anti-ship cruise missile, another weapon that is expected to be relatively large. Heavier stores loadouts translate to increased fuel burn, as well as less margin for carrier-based aircraft to bring them back to the ship. There is also the matter of the Navy's work to introduce new infrared search and track (IRST) sensors in modified centerline drop tanks with reduced fuel capacity. IRSTs are an increasingly important capability for tactical jet fleets across the U.S. military. The Navy is also in the process of fielding a new family of next-generation electronic warfare pods for the EA-18G. GAO has reported in the past that Raytheon's ALQ-249(V)1 Next Generation Jammer-Mid Band (NGJ-MB) pods produce more drag than the existing AN/ALQ-99s and reduce range as a result. Weight and drag issues may also have contributed to the Navy's decision to choose an entirely separate design for the NGJ-Low Band (NGJ-LB) pod from L3Harris and Northrop Grumman rather than an NGJ-MB-derived proposal from Raytheon. A VAQ-133 Growler assigned to the USS Abraham Lincoln with AN/ALQ-249(V)1 Next Generation Jammer-Mid Band (NGJ-MB) pods under its wings. USN When it comes to extending the reach of its carrier air wings, the Navy is also still pursuing a fleet of uncrewed MQ-25 Stingray tankers, another Boeing product, to help increase the range of its carrier-based tactical jets. Core requirements for the Stingrays include the ability to offload at least 14,000 pounds of fuel (and potentially up to 16,000 pounds) up to 500 nautical miles (926 kilometers) away from the carrier. The MQ-25s will also have a secondary intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capability, and could take on other missions, including stand-off strike, in the future. At the same time, a series of delays have pushed back the timeline for the very first of the MQ-25s to begin entering operational service until at least 2026. Cost growth on the MQ-25 program also continues to be a major concern. As of August 2023, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), a Congressional watchdog, estimated the total Stingray program cost to be close to $15 billion, including the planned purchase of 76 drones. Past GAO estimates that also include associated construction work at various bases have put the program's expected price tag at around $16.5 billion. Just today, Boeing announced a $2 billion loss across various programs in its defense portfolio, including the MQ-25, during the third quarter of 2024. This was part of a nearly $6.2 billion loss for the entire company in the third quarter, adding to billions of dollars of already reported financial losses this year. Boeing's earnings report&#8230;$6.17b net loss in 3Q, $7.98b so far in FY. Beyond the $2b charges on KC-46, VC-25, T-7, MQ-25 and commercial crew, there's 'unfavorable performance on other programs.'&mdash; Brian Everstine (@beverstine) October 23, 2024 The aforementioned threat ecosystem means that fuel-hungry U.S. tactical jets will have to contend with how the evolving battlespace will limit access to traditional aerial refueling support, the capacity of which is expected to be strained by operational demands to begin with. This has put renewed emphasis on smaller tankers, crewed or uncrewed, such as C-130-based types, which could make use of a wider array of operating locations, as well as more novel capabilities. The Navy's carrier air wings are in an important transition period more broadly. The service plans to add a new F/A-XX sixth-generation crewed stealth combat jet and Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) loyal wingman-type drones to its carrier-based fleets in the coming years. The Navy has a now long-standing goal to have carrier air wings be sixty percent uncrewed in the future. Drones typically have greater range than their crewed tactical jet counterparts, and increasing the ratio of uncrewed platforms could also help extend the reach of carrier air wings by hundreds of miles. At the same time, Super Hornets and Growlers are expected to continue being workhorses of the Navy's carrier air wings for the foreseeable future. As such, finding ways to extend their reach to expand their operational flexibility and reduce vulnerability clearly remains of great interest, if not critical importance.

North Korean Troops In Russia Finally Confirmed By NATO, U.S.	After a week of saying they had no evidence of North Korean troops in Russia, officials at the White House, Pentagon and NATO have now gone on the record to say Pyongyang has indeed deployed a significant number of soldiers. 'We know that thousands of DPRK troops are in Russia to be trained,' a senior Biden administration official told The War Zone Wednesday morning. 'We don’t know what their mission will be or if they’ll go on to fight in Ukraine. But we do know that if they do this, it signals President Putin’s growing desperation in his war against Ukraine. Russia is suffering extraordinary casualties on the battlefield every day. If Russia needs to turn to DPRK for manpower, that’s a sign of desperation – not strength – on the part of the Kremlin.' Traveling with reporters in Rome, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin offered similar insights. 'Our analysts … continue to look at this,' he said, according to The Washington Post. 'Now we are seeing evidence that there are North Korean troops that have gone to … Russia.' Well that's a new one.

'What exactly they’re doing is left to be seen. But, yes, there is evidence that there are DPRK troops in Russia,' he added, using the abbreviation for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Asked about the intent of North Korea’s deployment, Austin said the United States is still trying to determine that. 'If they’re co-belligerents, if their intention is to participate in this war on Russia’s behalf, that is a very, very serious issue,' he said. 'It will have impacts, not only in Europe. It will also impact things in the Indo-Pacific as well.' In Brussels, NATO spokesperson Farah Dakhlallah also noted the presence of North Korean troops in Russia. 'Allies have confirmed evidence of a DPRK deployment to Russia,' she said, according to a tweet from Voice of America national security correspondent Jeff Selden. 'If these troops are destined to fight in Ukraine, it would ​ mark a significant escalation in North Korea's support for Russia's illegal war and yet another sign of Russia’s significant losses on the front line.' NATO is 'actively consulting within the alliance on this matter,' Dakhlallah added. 'The North Atlantic Council will receive a briefing from the ROK (South Korea) and further discuss this matter soon.' NEW: @NATO confirms #NorthKorea has troops in #Russia 'Allies have confirmed evidence of a #DPRK troop deployment to Russia' per @NATOpress spox Farah Dakhlallah&mdash; Jeff Seldin (@jseldin) October 23, 2024 We have been reporting for more than two weeks about the presence of North Korean troops deployed to Russia to bolster its fight against Ukraine. Yesterday, Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, head of GUR, told us that the first of those troops were expected to be on the battlefield in Kursk today. We have asked him for an update on that claim and will report any pertinent details he provides. While Budanov told us that there are nearly 12,000 North Korean troops in Russia, South Korean intelligence officials on Wednesday said there are about 3,000 at the moment with a total of 10,000 expected, the country’s Yonhap News Agency reported Wednesday. About 1,500 are elite special operations forces. 'After the first batch arrived in Russia from Oct. 8-13, an additional 1,500 soldiers have been sent there,' Rep. Park Sun-won of the main opposition Democratic Party told reporters, citing a report by National Intelligence Service (NIS) Director Cho Tae-yong. The troops have yet to arrive at the front and are instead stationed at military facilities in Russia where they are adjusting to their new circumstances, the publication reported. Last week we reported that the NIS released its assessment of the situation, which included satellite images purporting to show North Korean troops training in Russia's far east. However, the number of troops and if they are even North Korean cannot be confirmed by the satellite imagery provided. You can see one of those images below. A military facility in Ussuriisk, Primorsky Krai that South Korea’s spy agency says shows an estimated 400 North Korean personnel gathered on a parade ground. (NIS) 'The soldiers are undergoing special training on how to use military equipment and fly unmanned aerial vehicles, among other things,' Yonhap stated. A North Korean soldier receives around US $2,000 monthly for the service to Russia, NIS said. 'Russian instructors believe that North Korean soldiers are fit both physically and mentally, but they lack the understanding of modern warfare, such as drone attacks,' Yonhap reported. '‘They also expect multiple casualties among the North Koreans,’ the NIS was quoted as saying by the lawmaker.' At least six of Pyongyang’s forces, as we previously noted, have already been killed in Ukraine. All this comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin submitted a draft law to the Russian State Duma recently seeking ratification of a strategic partnership between Moscow and Pyongyang, hammered out in June. It calls for each side to provide military assistance to each other in the event of war. The exchange is not out of the goodness of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un’s heart. Moscow is providing him with nuclear weapons technology in return, Budanov told The Economist. 'Budanov describes the secret provisions of the agreement as a quid pro quo,' the publication reported. 'Russian hard cash and know-how in return for Korean men and missiles. Russia is helping North Korea circumvent sanctions and ‘strengthen’ its nuclear capabilities.' In particular, Budanov said Russia 'is transferring some technologies for low-yield tactical nuclear weapons and submarine missile-launch systems.' However, The Economist noted, 'there is no independent corroboration of this alarming claim.' More serious than troops: 'According to Mr Budanov, [North Korean] shipments that began as long ago as in late 2022 have reached 2.8m shells a year, just 100,000 short of Russia’s own annual production at 2.9m shells.' Shashank Joshi (@shashj) October 23, 2024 Officials at the White House, Pentagon and NATO have yet to say how they would respond if North Korean troops engage on a large scale in battles with Ukrainian forces. As we noted yesterday, U.S. officials, East Asian diplomats and congressional aides are saying there is not much the U.S. to stop North Korea from sending troops to Russia. 'They concede that Washington has made little to no progress in slowing North Korea’s rogue nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, and if it can’t do that, it can only do so much to halt North Korean troop deployments to Russia, too,' those sources told Politico. The presence of even 12,000 North Korean troops may not drastically alter the outcome of the fight even if about 1,500 of them are said to be elite special operations forces. However, with plenty more at his disposal, Kim could eventually increase the supply of troops to Russia dramatically.
