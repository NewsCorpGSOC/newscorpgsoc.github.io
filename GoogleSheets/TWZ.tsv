Navy’s Cruiser Modernization A Lesson In How Not To Run Such A Pr...	A government watchdog report released Tuesday highlights problems in the U.S. Navy’s yearslong, multi-billion dollar Ticonderoga class cruiser modernization program. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) report sheds new light on the systemic issues that have plagued the effort, such as lax contractor oversight and a lack of understanding regarding what kind of work the ships would need before they could return to the fleet. At the same time, the GAO report highlights the corrosive effect of deferred maintenance and warns that the Navy hasn’t sufficiently codified reforms to prevent such a boondoggle from happening again, particularly as it embarks on an ambitious $10 billion modernization program for 23 ships in its Arleigh Burke class destroyer fleet. The U.S. Navy spent nearly $4 billion modernizing seven of its aging Ticonderogas over the past decade, according to the GAO. But only three of the large surface combatants will complete the modernization process, and none of those will gain an extra five years of service life as originally envisioned. Nearly half that money spent, $1.84 billion, was 'wasted' modernizing four cruisers that never returned to sea and were retired by the Navy. A graphic from a Government Accountability Office report on Navy cruiser modernization showcases how few cruisers the Navy has actually modernized. (Government Accountability Office) For the cost and relatively short extra service life of its three modernized cruisers, the service could have nearly bought two brand-new destroyers. 'While it is too late to salvage the cruiser modernization effort, failure to learn critical lessons poses risk to the future of the Navy’s surface fleet as it begins significant modernization efforts for other ship classes,' the report states. 'This is particularly true for DDG Modernization 2.0 and the amphibious ship service life extension and modernization. While some issues were unique to the cruiser effort, we observed shortfalls that span across the planning and execution of Navy ship maintenance and modernization periods.' The Ticondergoas carry Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAM) and serve as air and defense batteries and command and control platforms. They are also equipped with Harpoon anti-ship missiles, MH-60R Sea Hawk helicopters and execute anti-submarine warfare operations. They were built in the 1980s and early 1990s and act as the central node in the carrier strike group’s air and missile defense architecture, with their unique capacity to host the air defense commander of the strike group. The Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Cape St. George (CG-71) fires a missile. (U.S. Navy) There are nine cruisers still serving in the Navy today. Six are slated to be decommissioned in the coming years, while the other three–USS Gettysburg (CG-64), USS Chosin (CG-65) and USS Cape St. George (CG-71)-have been modernized or are close to finishing modernization and will serve out toward the end of the decade. As TWZ reported last month, modernization has included Aegis Combat System improvements, a new AN/SPQ-9B radar and upgrades to the existing AN/SPY-1B, as well as an updated SQQ-89A(V)15 sonar suite, Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) modifications, and other work. Gettysburg entered the Middle Eastern waters of U.S. Central Command this week along with the rest of the USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75) carrier strike group, where it will perform air defense functions in a region that has been plagued by Iranian-backed Houthi rebel missile and drone attacks for the past year. The Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75) underway in 2022. (U.S. Navy) Chosin completed modernization and sea trials in early 2024, and the Navy plans to deploy it once more before its planned retirement in Fiscal 2027. Work on Cape St. George continues, with the Navy planning sea trials for this fiscal year, which began Oct. 1. 'Like USS Gettysburg and USS Chosin, the Navy currently plans to deploy USS Cape St. George at least once before divesting the ship in fiscal year 2027, according to senior Navy officials,' the report states, adding that the Navy now plans to decommission all three ships by Fiscal 2030. The Navy has been working to have Flight III Arleigh Burke class destroyers take on the air defense command role of cruisers, but to date, the service only has one Flight III destroyer, and questions have been raised about the viability of having a 'maxed out' subclass of destroyers serving in such a capacity, TWZ previously reported. The GAO notes that the new Flight IIIs are facing 'significant delivery delays,' with some ships falling more than two years behind schedule. The U.S. Navy's first Flight III Arleigh Burke class destroyer, USS Jack Lucas (DDG-125). (U.S. Navy) TWZ has covered the fits and starts of the Navy’s cruiser modernization program, and Tuesday’s GAO report highlights the broader systemic failings that led to it. The Navy plans to divest its three modernized cruisers 'without fully assessing the implications to its force structure, including costs, benefits and risks,' according to the GAO, and the service will look to squeeze one more deployment out of those three ships before they are mothballed. But that decision, according to the GAO, 'is not based on the full knowledge of the condition of the ships and associated operational implications because the Navy has not completed a comprehensive assessment of costs, benefits and risks of divesting the ships, as well as of ship conditions.' Navy officials told the GAO that 'they do not see the value the cruisers bring to the fleet,' because they are unreliable and suffer longstanding issues such as hull cracking, while also being less capable in some regards than more modern destroyers. But those same officials also acknowledged that they have not conducted inspections to understand the reliability and condition of the modernized ships. Cruiser modernization dates back to 2012, when the Navy first sought to retire multiple Ticonderogas due to budget constraints. Congress rejected such proposals and funded the modernization effort, and the sea service planned a phased approach that would give 11 cruisers five years of extra service life each. But the Navy did not fully understand the condition of its cruisers before they entered modernization, and officials told GAO that the ships were in worse condition than they realized. This was due to the Navy cancelling maintenance periods for their ships earlier in their service lives, allowing problems like fuel tank cracks to fester and balloon into major problems by the time modernization commenced. The Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Gettysburg (CG-64). (U.S. Navy) 'For example, according to OPNAV officials, the Navy deferred cruiser maintenance periods during the 2000s due to the operational need for the cruisers during the Global War on Terror,' the report states. 'Then, Navy officials told us the Navy canceled maintenance periods for the cruisers between 2011 and 2014, because the Navy was planning to divest the cruisers.' The Navy tried to better understand the cruisers’ conditions after Congress funded the modernization, and while these surveys were 'comprehensive and robust,' the high volume of unplanned work that emerged 'indicates that these efforts to gain information were unable to make up for years of not tracking ship condition and deferring maintenance,' the GAO report states. Officials told the GAO that the service is getting better at tracking required maintenance, helping ensure that ships can meet their service lives. 'However, these improvements are more impactful as a preventive measure on newer ships that have yet to fall behind than for older ships where the Navy has already deferred significant maintenance and lost track of condition, as happened with the cruisers,' the report states. Under its so-called 'Phased Modernization Plan,' the Navy inactivated the seven cruisers and cut manning from 350 billets to a 45-sailor caretaker crew, to save costs. Midway through each cruiser’s modernization, the ships force was supposed to be brought back to a normal size to help reactivate the ship, a decision the GAO called 'unusual.' 'A ship going through maintenance or modernization typically would not have its crew significantly reduced or be inactivated, according to Navy officials,' the GAO report states. This led to a host of problems when it came time to turn a given cruiser back on. 'Inactivating the ships and reducing the crew made it more difficult for program officials to understand the condition of and maintain the ships, thus inhibiting accurate planning for the modernization effort,' according to the GAO. 'For example, according to Navy officials, it was hard to assess the condition of inactivated ship systems. Further, because the ships had reduced crews of 45 sailors and the systems were turned off, these systems further deteriorated.' The GAO’s report–which involved interviewing more than 100 officials–also found that the Navy 'did not effectively plan the cruiser effort,' leading to a high amount of unplanned work that resulted in schedule delays and cost growth, including 9,000 contract changes. 'The Navy has yet to identify the root causes of unplanned work or develop and codify root cause mitigation strategies to prevent poor planning from similarly affecting future surface ship modernization efforts,' the report states. Once work began on the cruisers, the Navy at times struggled to provide the proper level of oversight, the GAO report states. A 2018 decision 'restricted officials from assessing monetary penalties to contractors without senior leadership approval,' according to the GAO. And in 2020, leadership reduced inspections of contractor work by nearly 50 percent, actions taken 'to maintain strong working relationships with the contractors because of the Navy’s dependence on them to modernize its fleet.' A graphic in a Government Accountability Office report on the Navy's cruiser modernization efforts shows how contractor oversight was reduced. (Government Accountability Office) 'Despite widespread instances of poor-quality work during the cruiser modernization effort, [Naval Sea Systems Command] senior leadership discouraged [Regional Maintenance Centers] and contracting officials from fully using key quality assurance tools to maintain the industrial base and a positive working relationship with the ship repair industry,' the report states. 'This reduced the RMC’s ability to ensure that contractors were producing quality work. Further, Navy guidance does not set forth clear roles that enable coordination among several key stakeholders within the Navy, which further inhibited effective oversight of work.' The GAO highlights several ships in the dwindling cruiser fleet and their persistently subpar state, even after years of modernization work. The USS Cowpens (CG-64), decommissioned in August 2024, went through eight years of modernization and still needed roughly $88 million and three more years of work as of June 2022, according to GAO, and photos from the following year reveal rust and corrosion on the deck plate, as well as holes in its flooring. An image from the Government Accountability Office's report on Navy cruiser modernization showcases the sorry state of the USS Cowpens' (CG-63) deck. (GAO) Another, USS Vicksburg (CG-69), was decommissioned in July 2024. Officials estimated in 2023 that it would require an additional $100 million, which did not include the cost to dry dock the ship and fix its sonar dome. The combat information center aboard the Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Vicksburg (CG-69) after years of modernization work. (Government Accountability Office) Even cruisers that have completed modernization are having issues, according to the GAO. The deployed Gettysburg completed its modernization and sea trials in February 2023, and the Navy’s Board of Inspection and Survey ruled that the ship met the minimum standard for going to sea. But a year later, in January 2024, the same board identified 'several outstanding issues during an inspection of the ship’s condition.' 'For example, several elements of the weapons systems were inoperable or degraded and there were structural issues throughout the ship,' the report states. The Navy addressed several of these issues after that inspection, and the cruiser completed 18 days at sea in June 2024, including a successful missile launch and intercept using its updated combat systems software. But before Gettysburg deployed in September 2024, the ships force told GAO of problems with steering gear and hydraulic power unit parts, among others, and that the Navy cannibalized parts from already-decommissioned cruisers. 'According to the ship’s crew, propulsion plant and electric system failures were key concerns for the USS Gettysburg deployment,' the report states. Cruisers that entered modernization all suffered 'widespread contractor performance and quality issues,' with Navy Regional Maintenance Centers issuing 1,400 corrective action requests to contractors to fix their incorrect work, the report states. One contractor used 'unauthorized materials such as plastic wrap, tape with common store bought glue, expanding foam and and as seen on television sealant products' to fix large sonar dome cables on a cruiser not identified by name in the GAO report. Shoddy work aboard a Ticonderoga class cruiser that the U.S. Navy was modernizing. (Government Accountability Office) A sonar dome rubber window damaged by a contractor during a U.S. Navy cruiser modernization effort. (Government Accountability Office) In another instance, contractors installed gun foundations at an incorrect height, requiring them to be removed and reinstalled, which led to a four-month delay. 'In addition, the gun could not fire without hydraulic fuel leaking,' the report states. 'Ship’s crew officials told us that they did not discover this issue until combat systems sea trials. The Navy has since corrected these issues.' A main gun aboard a U.S. Navy Ticonderoga class cruiser. (Government Accountability Office) On another ship, quality assurance officials noted five contractor personnel in three separate areas of the ship using incorrect welding methods in a single day. The Navy also failed to ensure that contractor work was sequenced properly. This led to delays in contractors installing equipment, and incomplete cabling and electrical distribution, aboard Vicksburg, the ship’s crew told GAO. 'They also told us that these issues led to 22 tons of electronic equipment sitting idle with no air conditioning,' the report states. 'Officials said a lack of temperature control caused problems preserving the computer equipment used to operate the Aegis Combat System aboard USS Vicksburg and that most likely a large portion of the electronic equipment is not salvageable. As another example, crew aboard USS Chosin told us that a modernization team contractor was unable to test a key system because the ship’s ventilation was not working. This caused a delay in ensuring that all key systems were operational.' The GAO report points out how unusual it is for a ship in maintenance to be transferred from Naval Surface Forces to Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) and back, and Navy officials noted that transferring ownership should not happen again. Navy officials concurred with the GAO that such lessons should be codified, but also told the watchdog that the Navy could need to inactivate a ship, reduce its crew size and transfer ownership to save money 'in a budget constrained environment.' 'They also stated that Navy leadership needs to retain flexibility,' the report states. 'However, doing so would likely significantly increase the risk of the Navy experiencing poor outcomes, as occurred with the cruiser modernization effort.' The Navy faces other challenges to increasing its overall fleet size, as well as maintaining its current warships and submarines. The new Constellation class frigates are also mired in delays, cost growth, and other problems, which you can read more about here. This is what led the service to announce last month that it would be extending the service lives of a dozen more Flight I Arleigh Burkes into the 2030s to help maintain overall operational capacity, according to past TWZ reporting. The Navy is relying on modernization efforts to maintain fleet size. And while service officials express confidence that the destroyer modernization program will not repeat the cruiser mistakes of the past, GAO’s findings indicate that such pitfalls remain a possibility.

Satellite Imagery Shows Ramp-Up In Russian Forces Massing At Base...	New satellite imagery shows large numbers of Russian vehicles and other materiel amassed at its Khmeimim Air Base and Tartus naval base in Syria. The active withdrawal of forces from Khmeimim is also continuing. This all comes despite continued insistence from authorities in Moscow that they are still looking to strike a deal to keep these highly strategic and prized facilities following the fall of the Assad regime. The War Zone obtained the new imagery of both Khmeimim and Tartus, which was taken today, from Maxar. The company also provided an additional image of Khmeimim from December 15 that highlights the significant departure of Russian forces from the base even by that point. The latest image of Khmeimim, seen below, shows dozens of vehicles and other equipment arranged in rows on an open apron at the northwest corner of the base, along with an Il-76 Candid cargo aircraft. Assets are often arrayed in this way on the tarmac at air bases ahead of their loading onto aircraft. Two smaller An-26 Curl turboprop transport aircraft, as well as a jet-powered An-72 Coaler, are also seen in nearby revetments. Satellite image ©2024 Maxar Technologies Russian forces have already been withdrawing from Khmeimim. This is now further underscored by Maxar's December 15 image of a portion of the northeastern end base, which notably shows the S-400 surface-to-air missile system site that had been deployed there for years has now been completely dismantled. Work to withdraw to the S-400, as well as other air defense assets, had already been observed at Khmeimim. Satellite image ©2024 Maxar Technologies Four Il-76s and Yak-40 small airliner are also seen on an open apron there. One of the Il-76s, as well as the Yak-40, belong to Syrian Airlines and there is the possibility that this Candid may have been one that went missing in the final chaotic moments of Assad's regime, are you can read more about here. There are also multiple helicopters visible, some of which appear to be missing their rotor blades. This could be a sign that they are being broken down to be loaded into transport planes. It appears that this Mi-8 is currently in the process of being taken apart for transport. It is missing its main rotor which was present on the image from a few days ago.Them dismantling helicopters is a very good sign that the base will cease to exist pic.twitter.com/xMMbbkUr47&mdash; Oliver Alexander (@OAlexanderDK) December 17, 2024 At Tartus, the Maxar imagery shows dozens of vehicles and other equipment clustered at the end of one of the piers.

A Ropucha class landing ship was also seen departing the Baltic last week and the Ivan Gren, another amphibious warfare ship, may be headed in the same general direction.

'They have ceased flight operations over the country.' 'It appears to us that they're [the Russians] taking the steps that would be necessary if they were planning to retrograde their forces from there,' the official added. 'We don't know if they've reached the decision to do that, or if they are in discussions on whether they need to do that or not, but that force consolidation that would enable them to depart has certainly happened.' From 'a naval perspective, they have sent their fleet that was in Tartus out into the eastern Mediterranean,' the official continued. 'It’s not in port in Tartus, or wasn't the last time I looked. And so, again, it looks like they're setting conditions to depart. And as I mentioned, they have ceased military operations there as best we can tell.'

Izzettin Kasim/Anadolu via Getty Images Though there is no doubt that Russia is significantly drawing down its military presence in Syria, as the senior defense official noted, it still remains unclear whether it plans to withdraw from Khmeimim and Tartus for good. There continue to be reports that Russian authorities are negotiating with representatives of the new rebel-led transitional government about the future of the bases. Officials in Moscow have consistently insisted that no final decision on the status of the facilities has been made. There are also unconfirmed reports that the Russian military may have been ordered to leave entirely within a month and that the Kremlin could now be looking to expand its presence in Libya as an alternative. As The War Zone has continued to stress, being ejected from Khmeimim and Tartus would be a huge loss for the Kremlin with ramifications extending well beyond Syria. The Russians have poured significant resources into expanding these bases, which Assad had essentially gifted to them through a 49-year 'lease' deal in 2017. The facilities offer uniquely strategic locations to project air and naval power into the Mediterranean and Africa. Any talks the Russians are having with rebel authorities in Damascus now can only be complicated by Moscow's instrumental and active role in keeping Assad's brutal regime in power over the past decade or so. Russian forces were still striking the very same rebels just days before they ousted Assad. The Kremlin also says that it helped Assad flee the country and that they have granted him asylum. Assad has remained out of the public eye for more than a week now. A report today from Politico says that some members of the European Union are pushing the bloc to actively pressure Syria's new government to force out the Russians. French authorities re-raised the country's flag at the embassy in Damascus today, which had been shuttered for the past 12 years, in the latest sign of Western powers looking to reengage post-Assad.

This includes an Israeli campaign of strikes on former regime military assets and ground intervention in the south, as well as an offensive by Turkish-backed rebels against U.S.-backed Kurdish groups in the north. The U.S. military itself remains a major player in the country, as well. Earlier today, the head of the U.S.-backed predominantly Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) offered major concessions, including turning the city of Kaboni into a demilitarized zone, as part of a proposal to end fighting Turkish-supported groups. He suggested American forces could help enforce such an arrangement.

'I think we all have a vested interest in ensuring that groups in the region capitalize on the situation here to enable the people of Syria to be able to have a better life than they did under the Assad regime.

Secretive Bladed AGM-114R9X Hellfire Missile Looks To Have Reemer...	A new targeted strike involving the use of the secretive AGM-114R9X Hellfire missile looks to have occurred in northwestern Syria. The R9X variant features an array of six pop-out sword-like blades rather than a traditional high-explosive warhead. This comes amid a flurry of foreign strikes, including U.S. military ones targeting ISIS, across the Middle Eastern country where the airspace is now permissive following the fall of long-time dictator Bashar Al Assad. American officials have been open about their fears that terrorist groups could exploit the current situation. As yet unconfirmed reports say that three missiles in total were fired at a vehicle in Syria's Idlib region near the border with Turkey. Who may have been inside the vehicle and who the intended target or targets may have been are unknown. Pictures now circulating online do show what looks to be the blade arrays from at least two AGM-114R9Xs, as well as other distinctly Hellfire debris. A *Unknown drone* went after a high ranking person in Idlib (north of Armanaz; close to the Turkish borde) - as of now it is unknown who it is.

This version of the Hellfire was developed explicitly as a way to prosecute targeted strikes while minimizing the risk of collateral damage to an extreme degree. The bladed version of the Hellfire, also nicknamed the 'ninja bomb' and 'the flying Ginsu,' has also been employed in multiple targeted strikes against vehicles in northwestern Syria in the past. MQ-9 Reaper drones tied to the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) are also understood to be the launch platform of choice. In fact, the first known instance of the R9X's use was in a 2017 strike that killed Al Qaeda’s then-number two leader, Abu Khayr Al Masri, as he traveled by car in Idlib. The War Zone was the first to call attention to the clear use of a mysterious new munition in that case.

As noted, American authorities have made no secret of their concerns about the chaotic situation in Syria following the downfall of Assad, as well as the drawdown of Russian forces in the country, providing new space for terrorists to regroup. American forces have launched dozens of strikes targeting ISIS in the past week or so. As The War Zone has highlighted in the past, the collapse of the Syrian military, as well as the ongoing pullback of Russian forces, has substantially reduced risks to U.S. and other foreign aircraft operating over the country. Strikes in the western half of Syria, in particular, had previously been carried out only by drones and through the use of stand-off munitions. 'U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) forces conducted precision airstrikes targeting known ISIS camps and operatives in Syria, Dec. 16, killing 12 ISIS terrorists,' CENTCOM said in a statement just yesterday. 'The strikes against the ISIS leaders, operatives, and camps were conducted as part of the ongoing mission to disrupt, degrade, and defeat ISIS, preventing the terrorist group from conducting external operations and to ensure that ISIS does not seek opportunities to reconstitute in central Syria. These recent strikes are in former Regime and Russian controlled areas ensuring pressure is maintained on ISIS.'

The United States has also launched targeted strikes against members of other groups, including Hurras al-Din (Al Qaeda's current Syrian franchise) and Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), in that corner of the country in the past. HTS, which claimed to have broken from Al Qaeda in 2016, was at the forefront of the ouster of Assad and is now leading the effort to create a new government in Damascus. The U.S. government has confirmed it has been in contact with HTS since the fall of the Assad regime, despite it, along with others, still officially designating the group as terrorists. The apparent R9X strike also underscores the ongoing fluidity of the situation throughout Syria and the sheer number of actors, internal and external, who remain very actively involved. Israeli and Turkish forces have been carrying out their own strikes across the country in pursuit of their own national security aims. Israel has been focused on preventing former Assad regime military assets from being used by other groups, while Turkey has been targeting Kurdish groups in the north, including U.S.-backed forces. Those countries have also been taking advantage of the newly permissive airspace above Syria. U.S. strikes in Syria, whether they involve R9Xs or not, as well as those by other foreign powers, only look set to continue amid the ongoing power vacuum in the country.

Multiple Drone Incursions Confirmed Over Marine Corps Base Camp P...	Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton in southern California experienced multiple drone incursions over its airspace over the past several days, a facility spokesman told The War Zone on Tuesday morning. Between Dec. 9 and 15, 'there were six instances of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) observed entering Camp Pendleton’s airspace, with no threat to installation operations,' Capt James C. Sartain, a base spokesman, told The War Zone in response to our query on the matter. Sartain could not immediately provide details about how many drones flew over the installation, their origin, what actions were taken in response and if any air or ground operations were affected as a result of the incursions. We have asked for these details and will update this story should any be provided. Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton Located in north San Diego County, MCB Camp Pendleton is the Marine Corps’ major west coast training facility. It is home to the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, 1st Marine Division, 1st Marine Logistics Group, elements of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, and several other tenant units including Marine Corps Air Station Camp Pendleton, ACU-5, Naval Hospital, the Marine Corps Tactical Systems Support Activity (MCTSSA), Weapons Field Training Battalion, Naval Weapons Station Fallbrook, and the Deployment Processing Command Reserve Support Unit - West). A map of the sprawling Camp Pendleton facility located on the SoCal coast. (USMC) This is just the latest in a growing string over incursions reported over U.S. military installations at home and abroad. News about MCB Camp Pendleton follows a drone incursion over Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio forcing the closure of its airspace Friday night into Saturday morning. The War Zone was the first to report that incident. On Tuesday, Wright-Patterson officials announced that there were additional incursions over the facility. 'Small unmanned aerial systems were spotted in the vicinity of and over Wright-Patterson AFB’s Area A and Area B during the late evening and early morning of Dec. 16 and Dec. 17th,' the 88th Air Base Wing said in a statement. 'Installation leaders have determined that none of the incursions impacted base residents, facilities or assets. The Wright-Patterson AFB airspace was not affected by the incursions.' 'The number of systems has fluctuated, and they have ranged in sizes and configurations,' the release added. 'Our units continue to monitor the airspace and are working with local law enforcement authorities and mission partners to ensure the safety of base personnel, facilities and assets. We request individuals in the area to contact either local police or Security Forces if they see anything suspicious, to include sUAS's or drone activity.' The sprawling Wright-Patterson AFB complex. (Google Earth) This all comes amid a growing frenzy about drones that began when they appeared over Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey on Nov. 18, which we were the first to report. Since then, the FBI said more than 5,000 reports of drone sightings came into its drone hotline, of which fewer than 100 merited further investigation. On Monday night, the Pentagon, FBI and Department of Homeland Security issued a statement that they have 'not identified anything anomalous and do not assess the activity to date to present a national security or public safety risk over the civilian airspace in New Jersey or other states in the northeast.' The full statement is below: 'There are more than one million drones lawfully registered with the FAA in the United States and there are thousands of commercial, hobbyist and law enforcement drones lawfully in the sky on any given day. With the technology landscape evolving, we expect that number to increase over time. FBI has received tips of more than 5,000 reported drone sightings in the last few weeks with approximately 100 leads generated, and the federal government is supporting state and local officials in investigating these reports. Consistent with each of our unique missions and authorities, we are quickly working to prioritize and follow these leads. We have sent advanced detection technology to the region. And we have sent trained visual observers. Having closely examined the technical data and tips from concerned citizens, we assess that the sightings to date include a combination of lawful commercial drones, hobbyist drones, and law enforcement drones, as well as manned fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and stars mistakenly reported as drones. We have not identified anything anomalous and do not assess the activity to date to present a national security or public safety risk over the civilian airspace in New Jersey or other states in the northeast. That said, we recognize the concern among many communities. We continue to support state and local authorities with advanced detection technology and support of law enforcement. We urge Congress to enact counter-UAS legislation when it reconvenes that would extend and expand existing counter-drone authorities to identify and mitigate any threat that may emerge. Additionally, there have been a limited number of visual sightings of drones over military facilities in New Jersey and elsewhere, including within restricted air space. Such sightings near or over DoD installations are not new. DoD takes unauthorized access over its airspace seriously and coordinates closely with federal, state, and local law enforcement authorities, as appropriate. Local commanders are actively engaged to ensure there are appropriate detection and mitigation measures in place.' DHS, @FBI, @FAANews, and the @DeptofDefense released the following joint statement on the ongoing response to reported drone sightings. pic.twitter.com/ihGcGbjOEy&mdash; Homeland Security (@DHSgov) December 17, 2024 However, public furor has become so concerning that the FBI and New Jersey State Police last night issued a plea for people to not fire lasers or bullets at anything in the sky. 'We are seeing an increase of pilots of manned aircraft being hit in the eyes with lasers as people on the ground think they see a drone,' cautioned Nelson Delgado, the Acting Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Newark Field Office, which is leading the drone investigation. 'We are also concerned that people will take matters into their own hands and fire a weapon at an aircraft. Not only is this act against the law, but it poses an incredible danger to the pilots and passengers on those aircraft.' 'Whatever your beliefs are,' Delgado added, 'putting someone else's life in danger is not the answer.' pic.twitter.com/ELgIo1gnOt&mdash; FBI Newark (@FBINewark) December 16, 2024 The FBI warning came after pilots of 15 fixed and rotary wing aircraft from Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst reported being struck by lasers from the ground since Dec. 7, Capt. Kitsana R. Douglomachan told The War Zone. One of those pilots had to seek medical treatment but was quickly released. All aircraft landed safely, he said, adding that officials do not know who fired the lasers. NJ.com was the first to report these incidents. Monday night, Hill Air Force Base became the latest installation experiencing drone incursions. 'We can confirm that unmanned aerial systems were spotted in the vicinity of Hill AFB recently,' a spokesperson told KUTV-2 news Monday night. 'To date, unmanned aerial systems have not impacted Hill AFB operations and all appropriate measures are being taken to safeguard Hill AFB personnel, assets, and infrastructure.' An amazing elephant walk of F-35s at Hill Air Force Base. USAF U.S. officials are still trying to discover the origin of drones that appeared over four U.S. Air Force bases in the U.K., another story we first broke. They’ve been spotted over RAF Lakenheath, RAF Mildenhall, and RAF Feltwell, all within close proximity, and RAF Fairford, about 130 miles to the west. A few days earlier, Ramstein Air Base in Germany joined the growing list of places registering unknown drone overflights. TWZ has been on the leading edge of covering this topic for years and has broken multiple stories now about drone incursions over key U.S. bases and training ranges, as well as uncrewed aerial systems, harassing American forces off the coasts of the United States and making worrisome overflights of important non-military sites. A spate of drone incursions over Langley Air Force Base in Virginia in December 2023, which TWZ was the first report on, has now become a particular focal point of concern about these instances. While authorities are downplaying the majority of public drone sightings, they acknowledge a real concern about those flying over military installations, which as we have noted, forced the closure of airspace over one of those facilities.

Russian General Accused Of Using Chemical Weapons Assassinated By...	The Security Service of Ukraine has claimed responsibility for the assassination of a Russian general, the most high-profile killing of its kind since the start of the Kremlin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, the commander of Russia’s radiation, chemical, and biological defense troops, known as the RKhBZ, was killed in an explosion, along with his assistant, in Moscow early this morning, a day after Ukrainian state prosecutors charged him in absentia with the alleged use of banned chemical weapons. Sources within the Security Service of Ukraine, or SBU, told various news agencies that the killings were a 'special operation' by the organization. 'The liquidation of Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, chief of the Russian Armed Forces’ radiation, chemical, and biological defense troops is a special operation by the SBU,' one source told AFP. A view of the scene after Lt. Gen.

'We were involved in the operation,' the source said. Kirillov and his assistant were killed outside a Moscow apartment, when a bomb hidden in an electric scooter went off, according to Russia’s Investigative Committee, which probes serious crimes.

Kirillov had been listed on the Ukrainian Myrotvorets (Peacemaker) website, an unofficial database of people considered to be enemies of the country. As of this morning, a photograph of Kirillov on the website had the word 'Liquidated' overwritten in red letters. While other senior members of the Russian Armed Forces as well as civic and industry leaders, and pro-Kremlin figures, have been targeted in assassination attempts, especially in Crimea and Russian-occupied areas elsewhere in Ukraine, this incident is especially notable. Not only was Kirillov, who was 54, the most senior Russian military officer to be assassinated inside Russia by Ukraine, but authorities in Kyiv immediately claimed responsibility for the action. Previously, such targeted killings have often been left unclaimed. A view of the scene after the explosion outside a house on Moscow’s Ryazansky Prospekt, Moscow, on December 17, 2024. Photo by Sefa Karacan/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, now the deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, has said that Moscow will avenge the killing, threatening Ukraine’s military and political leadership with an unspecified imminent response, according to the state-run RIA news agency. 'Realizing the inevitability of its military defeat, [Ukraine] launches cowardly and despicable strikes in peaceful cities,' Medvedev added, according to RIA. As for the RKhBZ, the role of this organization is often misunderstood in the West. Officially known as the Troops of Radiological, Chemical, and Biological Defense of the Russian Armed Forces, its primary task is to provide protection for Russian military units, allowing them to fight in conditions of nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) contamination. In addition, the RKhBZ is tasked to enhance the survivability of the Russian Armed Forces against other weapons on the battlefield, for example by laying smokescreens. Traditionally, the RKhBZ has also been responsible for the Russian Ground Forces’ TOS-1A, a multiple-launch rocket system (MLRS) that fires a thermobaric rocket payload. Soldiers of an RKhBZ unit from the Russian Western Military District decontaminate a BTR-82A armored personnel carrier during a training camp run by the 20th Guards Army. Russian Ministry of Defense Of course, the RKhBZ would be involved in protecting Russian troops both against the NBC contaminants that they use, as well as those deployed by a potential enemy. Accordingly, Ukrainian prosecutors charged Kirillov in absentia with the use of banned chemical weapons in Ukraine, only yesterday. According to the SBU, there have been more than 4,800 cases of such weapons being used by Russia since the start of the full-scale invasion, leading to over 2,000 Ukrainian service members having been hospitalized. In May of this year, the U.S. State Department determined that Russian forces had used chloropicrin — a toxic choking agent that has a disorientating effect — in Ukraine. This was 'probably driven by Russian forces’ desire to dislodge Ukrainian forces from fortified positions and achieve tactical gains on the battlefield,' the State Department concluded. A World War II poster describes the effects of chlorpicrin for the benefit of U.S. servicemen. National Museum of Health and Medicine As we have discussed in the past, the exact definition of what constitutes a chemical weapon is complicated. However, chloropicrin is classified as a choking agent by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and its battlefield use is expressly banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which Russia also signed. In October, the United Kingdom put sanctions on Kirillov and the RKhBZ, in response to Russian forces’ use of chemical agents on the battlefield. Russia has denied having used chemical weapons. Meanwhile, Russian claims also extend the blame for such violations to Kyiv’s Western allies, although no independently verified evidence of this has ever been presented. Kirillov was also part of Russia’s attempts to rebuff Ukrainian claims that it had used chemical weapons in Ukraine. He appeared in the past on Russian state TV giving briefings, in which he accused Ukraine of violating nuclear safety protocols as well as implicating the West in various alleged crimes. In this grab from AFPTV footage, Igor Kirillov speaks at a briefing over an alleged chemical attack on the Syrian city of Douma, at the Patriot Park in the Moscow region on June 22, 2018. Photo by AFPTV / AFP AFPTV In a tribute to Kirillov, Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for Russia’s Foreign Ministry, said that he had worked 'fearlessly' for 'the Motherland' to expose what she said were the West’s chemical weapons-related and other crimes, including in Syria. While Kirillov might well be the most senior Russian Armed Forces figure to have been assassinated since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, there has been a series of high-profile killings, targeting, in particular, those who Kyiv considers guilty of war crimes. In 2022, Darya Dugina, the daughter of the Kremlin-linked far-right ideologue Alexander Dugin, was killed by a car bomb in the Moscow region. In 2023, pro-war blogger Vladlen Tatarsky was killed when the St. Petersburg cafe he was in was bombed. Tatarsky, who was born in the Donbas region of Ukraine, and had fought with pro-Russian separatist forces, had become one of Russia’s most outspoken and ultranationalist military bloggers. Municipal workers clean up the debris in the aftermath of the April 2, 2023, bomb blast in a cafe in Saint Petersburg, which killed military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky. Photo by OLGA MALTSEVA/AFP via Getty Images OLGA MALTSEVA Also last year, Stanislav Rzhitsky, a Russian submarine commander, accused of war crimes by Ukraine, was shot dead while jogging in the southern Russian city of Krasnodar. While Ukrainian authorities do not claim responsibility for all such assassinations, they have said that targeted killings are a legitimate tool in the war with Russia. Russian promises of revenge for Kirillov’s killing are nothing new, of course, but the high-profile nature of this latest assassination may prompt other reactions from the Kremlin. After all, the killing will likely have sent shock waves through the Russian Armed Forces leadership, in particular, raising questions about the safety of its senior officers even on the relative safety of home soil. A review of security protocols for leading Russian military personnel would seem to be an immediate priority. 'The killing of a lieutenant general will be a shock for many,' a former senior Russian defense official told The Guardian, speaking on conditions of anonymity. 'This will definitely cause a stir,' the former official added. Bolstering the security details assigned to figures like Kirillov would be one obvious response. However, relevant units of the Russian Armed Forces and internal security forces are already heavily engaged in Ukraine, with an ever-present threat of assassinations and sabotage in Russian-occupied areas. For now, the assassination of Kirillov appears to be a win for Ukraine, which will see his elimination as justice for his involvement in the alleged use of banned chemical weapons. It is also perhaps the most powerful signal so far of the potential vulnerability of even the highest-ranking Russian military officers, wherever they might be. At the same time, it could result in a renewed focus by the Kremlin in targeting Ukrainian leadership.

The Mystery Of The Syrian IL-76 Cargo Jet That Went Missing As As...	There is growing, but still circumstantial evidence that a Syrian Airlines Il-76 Candid cargo plane currently at Russia's Khmeimim Air Base in Syria is one that appeared to go missing in the final chaotic moments of Bashar Al Assad's regime. Rumors and claims swirled that the aircraft had been carrying Assad and was shot down after it disappeared from online flight tracking sites. The Syrian dictator fled the capital Damascus for Khmeimim, and then to Moscow, according to the first statement attributed to him in more than a week that was put out earlier today. A Syrian Airlines Il-76 is seen at Khmeimim Air Base on December 15, 2024. Izzettin Kasim/Anadolu via Getty Images The statement said to have been from Assad was posted through a channel on the Telegram social media network linked to the now-defunct Syrian regime earlier today, but it is unclear whether or not he actually drafted it and/or put it online. The deposed Syrian dictator has not been seen publicly in more than a week, despite Russian officials saying they have offered him asylum. You can read more about the overall current situation in Syria, which remains very fluid, in our past reporting here. Assad relocated to Khmeimim via unspecified means and with Russia's assistance on December 8, according to the statement. It also claims the Syrian strongman had initially intended to continue commanding the fight against rebel forces from the Russian base. So far there is no independent corroboration of this assertion. The War Zone has noted in the past that the Russian air base would be the safest place in the country for Assad in a crisis. 'With no viable means of leaving the base, Moscow requested that the base's command arrange an immediate evacuation to Russia on the evening of Sunday 8th December,' the statement adds. 'This took place a day after the fall of Damascus, following the collapse of the final military positions and the resulting paralysis of all remaining state institutions.' The basic timeline outlined in the statement aligns with online flight tracking data that showed a Syrian Airlines Il-76 with the Syrian registration YK-ATA fly north from the Damascus area early on December 8. The tracking data for that flight cut out just after it passed the city of Homs, which rebel forces had taken control of on December 7. That, combined with data showing a pronounced left turn and a precipitous drop in speed and altitude, all the way down to 1,625 feet and 130 knots, had quickly sparked rumors that the aircraft had been shot down. Last night we tracked a Ilyushin Il-76T flight over Syria.The flight took off from Damascus and the signal was lost near the city of Homs.* We can confirm that flight took place.* The aircraft was old with an older transponder generation, so some data might be bad or… pic.twitter.com/uCGUnVeug0&mdash; Flightradar24 (@flightradar24) December 8, 2024 Publicly available data from NASA’s Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS), which is primarily intended to help monitor wildfires and other blazes sparked by natural disasters, had also shown a 'hot spot' exactly in the area where the aircraft dropped off radar. The War Zone has been working to obtain high-resolution imagery of this location, but we have not received a clear picture yet. No imagery has otherwise emerged to date showing any apparent Il-76 wreckage in Syria.

'With that in mind, analyzing the raw ADS-B data received from YK-ATA shows positional and speed data that strains credulity.' It's also worth noting here that YK-ATA's trip north was unusual, to begin with, based on flight tracking data from ADS-B Exchange that The War Zone reviewed. In the months leading up to Assad's fall, the plane was very active, but was observed flying routes to and from locations in Africa. Flightradar24's December 12 blog post also says that 'in recent months the aircraft has visited Benghazi, Libya on a regular basis.' There are now reports that Russia may be looking to make any losses to its presence in Syria by expanding its posture in Libya, though there are no indications that is tied to YK-ATA recent flight history. An example of a typical flight track for YK-ATA in the months leading up to the fall of Assad's regime. This particular flight occurred on December 3. ADS-B Exchange Furthermore, it has now been confirmed that a Syrian Airlines Il-76 is parked in one corner of an open apron at the northeast end of Khmeimim. Satellite imagery The War Zone has reviewed from Planet Labs show the Candid at its current position by December 9. An Il-76 was seen parked between the runways the day before and was not there on December 7. A Syrian Airlines Yak-40, a passenger plane that is between a large business jet and a small airliner size-wise, also appeared at the base on December 8. The Yak-40 was initially parked on a different apron, but was moved next to the Il-76 by December 13. The video in the social media post below, which was taken via a drone and that Turkey-based Syria TV put out last week, clearly shows a Syrian Airlines Il-76 at Khmeimim at multiple points in its runtime.

The Il-76 could have been used to help spirit other assets, including regime riches, to Khmeimim and then out of the country. It would have been a top priority for Assad to get physical assets, including gold and currency reserves, to a safe place. The Assad family has already been reportedly squirreling away vast wealth overseas for years. There are reports that other former regime officials have been fleeing to the Russian base in order to get out of the country with the Kremlin's help, as well. However, it remains unknown for sure whether or not it is YK-ATA at the Russian base. Syrian Airlines has four Il-76s in its inventory and no imagery has emerged so far clearly showing the registration on the example at Khmeimim. There is still a possibility that YK-ATA went elsewhere or came down. Questions very much remain about what might happen to the Khmeimim Air Base, including the Syrian Airlines aircraft there, as well as Russia's naval base at Tartus. The air and naval facilities are highly strategic facilities for the Kremlin that support operations beyond Syria. A substantial withdrawal of Russian forces from the country is underway, but it remains unclear whether or not they are leaving for good. Russian officials insist that they are still trying to hold on to their two prized bases, but there are unconfirmed reports that they could be ordered to vacate the country within a month. You can read more about what is known now about these deliberations in reporting here. The end of Assad's regime has already provided the opportunity for unprecedented views of Khmeimim. Maybe now clearer imagery will emerge showing the Syrian Airlines Il-76's registration code to settle the question of whether this is the 'missing' jet for good.

North Korean Troops Launched Large-Scale Combat Operations In Kur...	North Korean troops began conducting large-scale assault operations against Ukrainian forces in Russia’s Kursk region last week, the head of the Ukrainian Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR) told The War Zone on Monday. That timeline was later confirmed by the Pentagon. While there have been about 12,000 North Koreans in Kursk for months to help Russia push back the Ukrainian invasion there, they only recently began to attack in larger numbers, Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov told us. His comments followed those by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who on Saturday said that 'the Russians have begun to use North Korean soldiers in their assaults—a significant number of them. The Russians include them in combined units and use them in operations in the Kursk region. So far, only there. But we have information suggesting their use could extend to other parts of the frontline. There are also already noticeable losses in this category.'

One of their positions in Kursk was 'effectively covered' by first-person view (FPV) drones.

'Language barrier remains a difficult obstacle to management and coordination of actions,' GUR explained. As a result, North Korean soldiers fired on vehicles belonging to the Akhmat battalion of Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov. At least eight of those fighters were killed in the incident, GUR claimed. On Saturday and Sunday, at least 30 North Koreans were killed or wounded in fighting near three villages - Matrynovka on the easternmost portion of the Ukrainian salient, Plekhovo in a contested area about 10 miles to the south, and Vorobzha, which is about nine miles to the southeast in Russian-held territory. The War Zone cannot independently verify Ukraine's casualty claims. The North Koreans suffered losses fighting near Martynovka in Russia's Kursk Oblast, Ukraine claims. Google Earth image 'Due to losses, the assault groups are being replenished with fresh personnel, in particular from the 94th separate brigade of the DPRK army, to continue active combat operations in the area,' GUR explained, using the official Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) acronym for North Korea. The Pentagon’s top spokesman on Monday confirmed GUR's claim that the North Koreans are now fighting alongside Russians. They entered combat alongside Russian troops 'about a week ago,' Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters at a Pentagon briefing. 'We do have indications that they have separate casualties, both killed and wounded,' he said. 'I don't have specific numbers to provide for you, but that is obviously something that we continue to monitor. And as we've said all along, those forces are legitimate military targets for the Ukrainians, given that they are engaged in active combat.' North Korean and Russian troops are now fighting together in Kursk officials say. (Via Twitter) Via Twitter After launching the Kursk invasion in August, Ukraine captured about 500 square miles of what was initially lightly defended territory. Russia has since mounted two counter-operations, including one in September that saw upwards of 60,000 troops recapture about half of what it had lost by the end of November. Since then, there haven’t been any major territorial gains or losses by either side as the fight has bogged down in the frigid December weather. Having 12,000 North Koreans in the mix is certainly a boon for Russia, even with language and command and control issues. As we have noted before, as Moscow and Pyongyang continue to cement their relationship, many more troops could be on the way given that manpower is North Korea's greatest resource. There are many other facets to this relationship. In addition to potentially receiving air defense systems and energy supplies from Russia in exchange for the troops in Kursk and assorted weaponry, including millions of artillery shells, North Korea is reportedly going to receive fighter aircraft as well. Russian Su-27 (Dmitry A. Mottl/Wikimedia Commons) There have also been concerns that Moscow might provide North Korea with technologies to help accelerate its nuclear and long-range ballistic missile programs. Russia would also be a prime candidate to assist North Korea in pushing forward its submarine program, which also includes a growing family of submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) as well as increasingly advanced submarine technologies. PHOTO BY VLADIMIR SMIRNOV/POOL/AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES On Monday, the Foreign Ministers of Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the High Representative of the European Union issued a joint statement condemning the burgeoning North Korea-Russia relationship. Those nations also raised concerns that this is inflaming tensions on the Korean peninsula. 'Direct DPRK support for Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine marks a dangerous expansion of the conflict, with serious consequences for European and Indo-Pacific security,' the statement read in part. 'The DPRK’s export of ballistic missiles, artillery shells, and other military materiel to Russia for use against Ukraine and Russia’s training of DPRK soldiers involving arms or related materiel represent flagrant violations of United Nations Security Council resolutions 1718 (2006), 1874 (2009), and 2270 (2016). We are deeply concerned about any political, military, or economic support that Russia may be providing to the DPRK’s illegal weapons programs, including weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery, which would exacerbate the already tense environment on the Korean Peninsula.' Ukraine's investment in Kursk comes as it continues to lose ground in the eastern part of its own country. As we have continuously highlighted in the past, Kursk is a bargaining chip. With Donald Trump set to return to the White House on Jan. 20, both sides are trying to grab as much territory as possible ahead of any future peace negotiations or any plan implemented by the new administration. The Latest Elsewhere on the battlefield, Russia continues to make gains in the east, particularly in Donetsk Oblast. Their push toward Pokrovsk continues but has yet to succeed. These are the key takeaways from the latest Institute for the Study of War assessment. Russian forces conducted a roughly battalion-sized mechanized assault in the Siversk direction following a recent reported command change of the Russian forces operating near Siversk. The recent Siversk assault indicates that Russian forces appear to be learning to conduct more effective assaults but remain far from restoring maneuver to the battlefield. North Korean forces are reportedly facing expected struggles with high casualties and poor communication with Russian forces in Kursk Oblast, likely disrupting coordination between North Korean and Russian personnel and undermining Russian military operations. Russian forces recently advanced near Siversk, Toretsk, Pokrovsk, and Vuhledar.

The sniper 'was actually on the same terrain level with the Russian occupier, aimed in the harsh Ukrainian December, fired while standing in a trench at the enemy, who was moving in a landing - and hit with the first shot,' GUR stated on its website. '‘In the conditions of modern warfare, you do not have the opportunity to climb out of a trench, lie down in a landing, etc. Enemy drones do not allow you to shoot from classic positions,’' the scout explained.' The shot was 'a masterful job that will definitely go down in the history of our struggle for freedom,' Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov said in a statement on the GUR website. 'Hitting a moving target at such a distance is a huge achievement; evidence of high professionalism and concentration, which snipers of Ukrainian military intelligence are famous for. We continue the fight to destroy even more Russian occupiers!' To make the shot, Lecturer said he fired a .338 Lapua Magnum (8.6mm) round from a Sako TRG M10 sniper rifle. 'But if I had a choice: to choose one rifle and one cartridge, I would take the Cadex Kraken and the .338LM caliber,' noted 'Lecturer.' The confirmed record for this caliber belongs to the British sniper, Corporal of the Royal Guards Regiment 'Blues and Royals' Craig Harrison.

Future Of Russia’s Bases In Syria Remains In Flux, Libya Possible...	While the Russian military continues to withdraw equipment and troops from Syria, Israel has continued its air raids, intended to further degrade what is left of the former Syrian Armed Forces’ fighting capacity. Israel bombarded Syria overnight with what was described by a U.K.-based war monitor group as 'the heaviest strikes' in the area in more than a decade. Meanwhile, there are varied reports suggesting that Russian forces might vacate Syria within days, or within a month, although officials on both sides have stressed that negotiations are ongoing. Overnight Israeli strikes on the Syrian coastal Tartus region targeted various sites including air defense units and surface-to-surface missile depots, according to the war monitor group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The same group said these were 'the heaviest strikes in Syria’s coastal region since the start of strikes in 2012.'

Photo by Bakr ALKASEM / AFP BAKR ALKASEM Outside of the Tartus region, Israel is also reported to have targeted missile launchers in the Hama area and radars at the military air base at Deir ez-Zor. The ongoing campaign of Israeli strikes is designed to destroy regime weapons stockpiles to prevent them from falling into the hands of Islamist groups. Last week, the Israeli military said it had conducted 350 strikes in Syria, destroying 80 percent of the strategic military capabilities left behind by the Bashar al-Assad regime. The Israeli bombardment has led to protests from the new Syrian administration, led by a rebel coalition. The administration has also lodged a complaint with the U.N. Security Council about Israeli incursions into Syrian territory in the Golan Heights. Israeli troops and military vehicles cross in and out of Syria through a gate in the boundary fence near the Druze village of Majdal Shams on the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights, on December 15, 2024. Photo by Mati Milstein/NurPhoto via Getty Images Mati Milstein Mohammed al-Jolani, the leader of the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) Islamist group that led the offensive against the Assad regime, said the Israeli strikes 'crossed red lines' but conceded that Syria was in no fit state to seek further conflict. 'Syria’s war-weary condition, after years of conflict and war, does not allow for new confrontations. The priority at this stage is reconstruction and stability, not being drawn into disputes that could lead to further destruction,' Jolani said in an interview with Syria TV. Some more details have come to light on Assad’s rapid departure from Syria earlier this month. In a statement published on the Syrian presidency’s Telegram channel, Assad claimed he left Russia's Khmeimim Air Base for Moscow on December 8. He claims that he was evacuated from the air base as it came under drone attack, having left Damascus the same morning as opposition fighters closed in on the capital. The comment was Assad’s first in public since he was toppled from power by the rebel offensive. Recent activity at Khmeimim Air Base and the Russian naval base at Tartus, in satellite imagery. PHOTO © 2024 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Having propped up the Assad regime, Russia is continuing to withdraw military equipment and troops from Syria. TWZ has already reported on apparent Russian evacuations from Khmeimim Air Base in Syria. These movements have now been confirmed by different Western officials — including two from the United States. However, those same officials, speaking to CNN, described the Russian withdrawal as 'large-scale and significant,' but said it was unclear if the evacuation would be permanent. With HTS now effectively in control in Syria, the fate of the Russian facilities — including Khmeimim Air Base and the naval base at Tartus — will be dependent on some kind of negotiated settlement between the rebel group and Moscow.

At the same time, an aerostat has also appeared over the base, to provide additional surveillance. A surveillance balloon, belonging to the Russian military, over Khmeimim Air Base on December 15, 2024. Photo by Izzettin Kasim/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu Other recent aircraft movements have involved the evacuation of Russian diplomatic personnel in Damascus as well as Belarusian and North Korean diplomats, using Russian Air Force flights out of Khmeimim. 'We don’t feel unsafe, we are hoping to make friendly relations with the new government as soon as it becomes a legitimate government,' a representative of the Russian military at Khmeimim told The Guardian today, in a rare interview. 'Neither side is making provocations and things have been fine,' the Russian military representative added. There is also now growing evidence of Libya’s support for the Russian military exodus from Syria. At least some of the Russian naval assets have been moved from Tartus to Libya, while there are reports that Moscow is stepping up pressure on Libyan National Army commander Khalifa Haftar to allow Russia access to a port in Benghazi. This would provide Russia with an alternative naval installation on the Mediterranean, the importance of which we have discussed in the past. At least one Syrian-registered Il-76 Candid airlifter has also been noted in recent days operating between Syria and Libya, and other locations in Africa. Should Russia end up leaving Syria altogether, Libya could well provide an alternative hub for the Russian military to provide access to the Mediterranean and as a transshipment point for other Russian interests in Africa. Officially, at least, Russia says it’s still to decide on the fate of its military bases in Syria. The Kremlin today said it was in contact with those in charge of the country.

This was confirmed today by Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder. Among the key systems that have departed are S-400 long-range surface-to-air missile systems previously based at Khmeimim. 'One of the big factors that has changed in Syria is the airspace, in the sense that previously you had Syrian regime and Russian air defenses, which would preclude in many cases our ability or desirability to go into those areas' to conduct anti-ISIS operations, Ryder told reporters. 'It is a much more permissible environment now, in that regard.' Since the fall of the Assad regime, the U.S. military has flown several rounds of airstrikes targeting ISIS camps and operatives in Syria. For now, it remains to be seen what kind of presence the Russian military will have in Syria longer-term. These are very much still early days in a tentative relationship being established between Moscow and the new administration in Syria; after all, Russian forces bombed HTS and other rebel groups, as well as much of the Syrian population for nearly a decade. However, should basing options in Syria fall through, it may be the case that Libya is on hand to provide some alternatives for the Russian military to retain its presence in the region.

China Launches Hypersonic Test Planes From Drones, Balloons	A video and pictures have emerged showing testing of Chinese high-flying and high-speed uncrewed air vehicles, including aerial releases from a TB-001 drone and a high-altitude balloon. The air vehicle designs are related to the MD-22, ostensibly a hypersonic testbed, which first broke cover two years ago. The bulk of the new imagery comes from the video clip seen in the social media post below. Additional pictures have also appeared online. A machine translation of the audio accompanying the footage shows an apparent focus on the life and inspiration of Qian Xuesen, rather than the MD-series vehicles. Qian did pioneering aerospace work in the United States, including co-founding NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, before being caught up in the Red Scares of the 1950s. He was subsequently placed under partial house arrest before being deported to China, where he became instrumental in the country's ballistic missile and space programs. 中国临近空间宽域飞行器研制试验首次公开披露！ pic.twitter.com/mLkCQQ5zX1&mdash; DS北风（风哥） (@WenJian0922) December 16, 2024 Still, the video does offer very interesting new looks and insights into the MD-22-related air vehicles. Examples are seen marked MD-19 and MD-21, as well as one where only 'MD-2' is visible. The MD-19 sports the logos of the Institute of Mechanics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (IMCAS) and CAS itself on the rear left side of its central fuselage. The development team behind the MD-22 includes IMCAS, as well as the Guangdong Aerodynamic Research Academy (GARA). IMCAS and CAS logos, as well as a read hexagon and illegible writing, are seen here at the rear of the left side of the MD-19's fuselage. Chinese Internet via X An air vehicle marked MD-21 is seen here in the background. Chinese Internet via X Only 'MD-2' is visible marked on the side of this air vehicle. Chinese Internet via X In the video, the MD-19, MD-21, and 'MD-2' all look to have the same general overall layout as the MD-22 with its wedge-shaped main fuselage, delta wings, and twin canted vertical tails. The MD-19 has retractable tricycle landing gear, a feature also depicted on the mockup of the MD-22 that first broke cover at the Zhuhai Airshow in 2022. The MD-22 design has been stated to be close to 35.5 feet (10.8 meters) long, had a wingspan of nearly 15 feet (4.5 meters), an empty weight of one ton, a maximum takeoff weight of four tons, a peak speed of Mach 7, and a maximum range of 4,970 miles (8,000 kilometers). The War Zone noted at the time that the range figure seemed, at best, highly aspirational and could reflect further iterations or evolutions of the design under development. A mock-up of the MD-22 on display the Zhuhai Airshow in 2022. Chinese Internet What kind of propulsion systems the MD-22 or any of these related vehicles use remains unclear. However, the new imagery further points to the core design being based around a single air-breathing main engine, possibly flanked by a pair of rocket motors. This, in turn, could indicate the use or planned use of advanced high-speed engines like dual-mode ramjets or scramjets, which do not work effectively at subsonic speeds. Platforms that use those engines therefore require some kind of initial boost, typically from one or more rocket motors. Aerodynamic fairings are seen in place at the rear of the MD-19 and 'MD-2' vehicles in the newly emerged imagery, which could break away when the various engines/motors start.

Chinese Internet via X The video and other images show the MD-19 being released from a TB-001 drone and then landing on a traditional runway. Whether this was a powered flight test or if the vehicle glided back down to Earth is unclear. The MD-19 also looks to be between one-third and one-quarter of the length of the nearly 33-feet-long (10-meter-long) TB-001, or between roughly eight and 11 feet (2.5 and 3.35 meters). This is notably shorter than the MD-22. A view of the MD-19 being released from the TB-001. Chinese Internet via X A low-resolution view of the TB-001 with the MD-19 under its wing. Chinese Internet via X Tengden's TB-001 is a now well-established design, versions of which are in operational service with China's People's Liberation Army (PLA). Though the TB-001 has been shown with various weapons and other stores loaded on pylons under its wings in the past, this appears to be the first time it has been seen launching another uncrewed platform of any kind in flight. A stock image of a TB-001 with various munitions, or mock-ups thereof, under its wings. VCG/VCG via Getty Images The newly emerged footage separately shows the 'MD-2' vehicle, which also appears to be smaller than the MD-22, being loaded into a payload adapter, which is then carried aloft by a high-altitude balloon and released. It's unclear if the vehicle's subsequent flight was powered at any point and how or if it was recovered afterward. China actively uses high-altitude balloons for various research and development and test and evaluation activities, as well as intelligence-gathering purposes and other military purposes. This includes past hypersonic testing, as well as use as aerial launch platforms for drone swarms and other payloads with a clear eye to future operational capabilities as The War Zone has previously explored in depth. Screen captures from the video showing the 'MD-2' being loaded into the payload adapter (at left) and after release (at right). Chinese Internet via X There is the potential that the 'MD-2' and MD-21, the latter of which is seen in the background at one point in the video, are one and the same, or at least examples of the same design. Given the known existence now of the MD-19, MD-21, and MD-22 vehicles, another possibility could be that the one released from the balloon was the MD-20. Whether the various MD-series vehicles are all testbeds and/or test articles supporting the development of a single design or are differently scaled members of a family of designs, and whether there are any additional related types, are unknown. In April, a grainy image emerged showing a Chinese H-6 bomber variant carrying a still unidentified dark-colored aerospace vehicle, seen below, which may have been an MD-22 or a related design, under its fuselage. Versions of the H-6 are used operationally as launch platforms for the WZ-8 rocket-powered supersonic spy drone. Chinese Internet via X Past descriptions have presented the MD-22 as a platform intended to support the development of hypersonic technologies more broadly. The Chinese government has been investing heavily in hypersonic capabilities in general in recent years and continues to do so, and those developments certainly require an array of specialized test assets and associated infrastructure. Various testbeds, including Stratolaunch's Talon-A, which is similar in some broad strokes to the MD types, but is larger and not air-breathing, are part of the U.S. military's hypersonic development plans for the same reasons. At the Zhuhai Airshow this year, the same GARA that worked on the MD-22 notably displayed a concept for an unpowered hypersonic boost-glide weapon called the GDF-600 designed to be loaded with various submunitions. Launching payloads of any kind from a platform traveling at hypersonic speed presents significant technological challenges because of the physical and thermal stresses involved, particularly during separation. The MD-series vehicles could be useful for proving out such a capability. It remains unclear whether there are any plans to operationalize the MD-series vehicles directly, but it would not be hard to see potential interest in doing so. An MD-series platform used to demonstrate how a high-altitude hypersonic air vehicle could perform missions like kinetic strike or intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), would be a clear stepping stone to an operational capability. Even smaller, shorter-range variations could be used in a similar role as the WZ-8 or even as missiles. Combining rocket motors with a high-speed air-breathing main propulsion system would also offer a valuable self-contained solution that could allow for multiple launch options, as is seen in the newly emerged video. Being able to air-launch the vehicles could extend their reach and otherwise provide additional flexibility in a real-world context.

M1A2 Abrams Tanks Arrive In Taiwan	Taiwan has received its first batch of M1A2T Abrams main battle tanks as it continues its drive to modernize its armed forces, which face an expanding military threat from Beijing. While the upgrade for the Republic of China Army (ROCA) — which was still operating 1950s-era M41A3 Walker Bulldog light tanks up until recently — is obvious, there are still questions about how suitable the big and heavy Abrams is for the island’s very particular defensive requirements. Heavy Armors Have Arrived!Welcome to join us!#M1A2T #ROCArmy pic.twitter.com/OTXtU7pw5h&mdash; 國防部 Ministry of National Defense, ROC(Taiwan) (@MoNDefense) December 16, 2024 Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense (MND) confirmed today that the first shipment of M1A2T tanks had arrived from the United States. On its official social media channel, the MND published imagery showing the Abrams being inspected and then loaded onto flatbed trucks for onward transport. The tanks were apparently unloaded from a ship at the port of Taipei yesterday. According to Taiwan’s state-owned Central News Agency (CNA), the initial shipment comprised 38 M1A2T tanks, at least some of which will be delivered to the ROCA’s Army Armor Training Command at Hsinchu in northwestern Taiwan. Other reports from Taiwan suggest that 10 of the new tanks will remain with the training unit, while the others will go to frontline armored brigades in Linkou District, New Taipei, and in Hukou Township, Hsinchu County. From there, they would be best positioned to help defend northern Taiwan. Part of the first shipment of M1A2T tanks is prepared for onward transport. Taiwan Ministry of National Defense In total, Taiwan has 108 M1A2T tanks on order. Citing the MND, the CNA reports that another 42 of the tanks will be delivered next year, with the remaining 28 to follow in 2026. Taiwan’s order for M1A2T tanks was approved in July 2019, in a deal valued at around $2 billion, as announced by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA). The arms package also included 250 Block I-92F Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, M88A2 armored recovery vehicles, and Oshkosh M1070A1 heavy equipment transporters. 'This proposed sale of M1A2 tanks will contribute to the modernization of the recipient’s main battle tank fleet, enhancing its ability to meet current and future regional threats and to strengthen its homeland defense,' the DSCA’s statement said at the time. 'These tanks will contribute to the recipient’s goal of updating its military capability while further enhancing interoperability with the United States and other partners.' Covered by a tarpaulin, one of the first M1A2T is transported by road. Taiwan Ministry of National Defense The ‘T’ in the designation of the new tanks indicates that this version was specifically developed for Taiwan. Previous Taiwanese media reports also described these as 'M1A2X' tanks. Broadly speaking, the M1A2T is equivalent to the M1A2 SEPv3 version — or System Enhancement Package version 3 — which you can read more about here. Development of the SEPv3 was launched by the U.S. Army in response to lessons learned during fighting in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Changes to the tank address space, weight, and power issues, as well as enhancing overall survivability. The SEPv3 version offers increased electrical power, vehicle health management systems, upgraded armor, the ability to deploy the Israeli-made Trophy active protection system, integrated counter-improvised explosive device (IED) protection, a new auxiliary power unit, and embedded training aids. The U.S. Army describes it as 'the most reliable Abrams tank ever produced.' A U.S. Army M1A2 SEPv3 main battle tank. U.S. Army The M1A2T specifically features a reconfigured turret and various unspecified modifications to improve its survivability, as well as a modified electrical system and auxiliary power unit, and a new ammunition datalink — used when firing programmable munitions. Taiwan’s requirement for new armor is reflected in the fact that the last tanks to be delivered from the United States were M60A3s, orders for which began to be received in 1994. Since then, the ROCA has relied on M60A3s as well as locally upgraded CM11 and CM12 Brave Tiger tanks. A Republic of China Army CM11 Brave Tiger tank. 玄史生 via Wikimedia Commons The CM11, which first appeared in 1990, is something of a hybrid, combining the turret from older U.S.-supplied M48A3 Pattons with the chassis of the M60A3. This tank also features a fire-control system derived from that found on the M1A1 Abrams, making it more accurate, including on the move. Taiwan also obtained a significant number of additional fire-control upgrade kits and installed them on some of their remaining M48A3s, resulting in the CM12. A Republic of China Army CM12 tank prepared for transport. 玄史生 via Wikimedia Commons Until 2022, the ROCA also used the M41A3 Walker Bulldog light tank, a type first delivered to the U.S. Army in 1951, which saw Cold War-era combat with the U.S. military during the Bay of Pigs invasion and later in Vietnam. Taiwan introduced it back in 1958 but later used it for training. An M41A3 in Republic of China Army service. Youth Daily News Nevertheless, much-reworked M41D tanks, based on the original M41 but with a new diesel engine, re-armed turret, and thermal imaging equipment, remain in use in small numbers. Even discounting the antiquated M41, the M1A2T is a much more modern and capable proposition than any of the ROCA’s other tanks. The M60A3, CM11, and CM12 are all armed with 105mm main guns that are outclassed by the larger 120mm cannons on modern Chinese main battle tanks, for example. The M1A2T uses a 120mm main gun complemented by a Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS) that combines a sensor suite with a machine gun. Facing the threat of a People’s Liberation Army (PLA) invasion, Taiwan’s defensive strategy means that every single tank and armored vehicle would have to count toward the island’s defense, were it to go to war. With Beijing continuing to claim Taiwan as its territory and with repeated threats to invade and seize control of the island by force if necessary, this has driven the retention of even obsolescent equipment. This is something that the M1A2T deliveries go some way to address. ROCA tanks and other assets take part in Combat Readiness Week maneuvers in 2020: On the other hand, the Abrams is a big, heavy, expensive, and maintenance-intensive machine. Even sustaining these tanks in combat is a big ask, their gas-turbine engines placing significant demands on fuel, especially. I think we need to mention sustaining these in a fight, including keeping them fueled, is an issue While there’s no doubting its firepower and performance, as well as very high levels of protection, it’s not invulnerable — as Ukraine’s experience has demonstrated. At the same time, the weight of the Abrams — especially the SEPv3 version — is such that it is not always able to negotiate softer ground or more basic roads. When Australia ordered the SEPv3, it was reported that significant parts of the north of that country — where much military training takes place — is too swampy and the roads too rudimentary to support the new tanks. The Trophy active protection system alone is said to add around 5,000 pounds of weight, with an overall weight, in combat, of 73.6 tons. It’s unclear if Taiwan will receive Trophy for its Abrams, but the equipment would provide a very useful additional layer of protection against various threats — including potentially drones. The Abrams is also arguably not best suited to the kinds of urban warfare that the ROCA might have to engage in if it meets a PLA invasion — something that it already regularly trains for in just these kinds of settings. These kinds of scenarios pose a particular challenge for main battle tanks. A ROCA M113 armored personnel carrier concealed under a bridge during an urban combat exercise. ROC Military News Agency More generally, there are questions about the utility of heavy armor in potential conflicts in the Indo-Pacific region. Most such scenarios are expected to heavily feature air and sea platforms, as well as missiles. These concerns have also led to a resurgence in interest in light tanks, including the U.S. Army’s new M10 Booker, which you can read all about here. A U.S. Army M10 Booker light tank. U.S. Army The M10 Booker. US Army In fact, the particular advantages of the M10 for Taiwan are something we have discussed in the past, speaking to an armor expert: 'The Booker would prove a valuable platform in a Taiwan ground fight … About two-thirds of the island is mostly rugged mountains. It features flat to rolling plains in the densely populated west, which faces mainland China. The M10’s smaller size compared to an Abrams would allow it to better maneuver through the tight, restricted urban areas where much of the fighting would take place. It would be able to pass over bridges an Abrams might not be able to cross due to weight concerns and operate … with a much lighter logistical footprint. The smaller 105mm main gun on the M10, the same expert added, 'is powerful enough to handle most Chinese equipment.' Nevertheless, for the time being, the ROCA is focused on the M1A2T and the major advantages in firepower and protection that it will bring compared with its predecessors. It’s also important to note that these tanks are just part of a multilayered defensive strategy for the ROCA, which also includes AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, long-range artillery, and multiple-launch rocket systems, as well as coastal defense missiles that would hope to create havoc among an invasion fleet before it even managed to land any troops and supporting armor. The nature of the modern battlefield and its myriad threats means that tank-on-tank warfare is not as probable nowadays as it once was, although Ukraine has shown the tank is not a dead concept by any means. But should it happen that the Republic of China Army has to face Chinese tanks in such a situation, the M1A2T Abrams at least offers a much higher level of capabilities than the tanks otherwise in Taiwanese service.

Drone Incursions Closed Wright Patterson Air Force Base’s Airspac...	The sprawling Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio is the latest military installation to report mysterious drones flying over its airspace, The War Zone has learned. 'I can confirm small aerial systems were spotted over Wright Patterson between Friday night and Saturday morning,' base spokesman Bob Purtiman told The War Zone on Sunday in response to our questions about the sightings. 'Today leaders have determined that they did not impact base residents, facilities, or assets. The Air Force is taking all appropriate measures to safeguard our installations and residents.' The drones 'ranged in sizes and configurations,' Purtiman said. 'Our units are working with local authorities to ensure the safety of base personnel, facilities, and assets.' The sprawling Wright Patterson AFB complex. (Google Earth) After the drones were seen over Wright Patterson, a Notice To Airman (NOTAM) was issued closing the airspace between Friday night and Saturday morning. The airspace has since been reopened, Purtiman said.

It's home to the Air Force Research Lab, Air Force Material Command, the 655th Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Wing, the National Air and Space Intelligence Center, the 445th Airlift Wing and the host 88th Air Base Wing, among other base tenants. The confirmation of drones over Wright Patterson came a day after the FBI, Department of Homeland Security, Federal Aviation Administration, and Defense Department (DoD) held a joint press conference to address the growing concern about sightings over the U.S., mostly in the airspace above New Jersey. The War Zone was the first to report the confirmation of drones being spotted over Picatinny Arsenal in that state. Since then, there has been a flood of mostly unconfirmed and erroneous reported sightings throughout New Jersey. Of more than 5,000 tips called into a national hotline set up to deal with these sightings, fewer than 100 generated leads 'deemed worthy of further investigation,' an FBI spokesman told reporters, including from The War Zone, on Saturday The overwhelming majority of these sightings, as we have previously reported, are crewed aircraft, the official reiterated on Saturday. 'Most of the reports of UAS have originated from the ground, with very, very few reports of UAS activities from pilots of manned aircraft,' said the FBI official, speaking on condition of anonymity. 'Overlaying the visual sightings reported to the FBI with approach patterns for Newark-Liberty, JFK, and LaGuardia airports - the density of reported sightings matches the approach patterns of these very busy airports, flights coming in throughout the night. This modeling is indicative of manned aviation being quite often mistaken with unmanned aviation or UAS.' Still, as we have reported in the past, there are several confirmed drone sightings in New Jersey reported by trained observers at Picatinny and Naval Weapons Station Earle in New Jersey. A Coast Guard vessel off New Jersey also had a recent encounter with drones. U.S. officials are still trying to discover the origin of drones that appeared over four U.S. Air Force Bases in the U.K., a story we first broke. They’ve been spotted over RAF Lakehheath, RAF Mildenhall, and RAF Feltwell, all within close proximity, and RAF Fairford, about 130 miles to the west. A stock picture of a 'No Drone Zone' sign and other warnings along the perimeter of RAF Lakenheath. Mark Kerrison/In Pictures via Getty Images Though the origin of these drones remains a mystery, DoD officials continue to claim that they are neither dangerous nor actions by foreign adversaries. 'We have no intelligence or observations that would indicate that they were aligned with a foreign actor or that they had malicious intent, but just kind of simply tell you we don't know. We have not been able to locate or identify the operators who are the points of origin,' the DoD official told reporters on Saturday. 'The main point is to deter the activity using some of our electronic means that can respond to most of these small commercial systems and deny them access to the airspace over our bases. We don't know what the activity is. We don't know &#8230; if it is criminal. But I will tell you that it is irresponsible. Here on the military side, we are just as frustrated with the irresponsible nature of this activity.' Such ambiguity is wearing thin on the public as people are increasingly demanding clarity from the federal government on the issue. Wright Patterson is just the latest in a long string of drone sightings over sensitive facilities and military capabilities. A few days ago, Ramstein Air Base in Germany joined the growing list of places registering unknown drone overflights. The U.S. Air Force has confirmed that there were drones seen over Ramstein Air Base in Germany. (Boris Roessler/picture alliance via Getty Images) TWZ has been on the leading edge of covering this topic for years and has broken multiple stories now about drone incursions over key U.S. bases and training ranges, as well as uncrewed aerial systems harassing American forces off the coasts of the United States and making worrisome overflights of important non-military sites. A spate of drone incursions over Langley Air Force Base in Virginia in December 2023, which TWZ was the first report on, has now become a particular focal point of concern about these instances. Most of the New Jersey drone sightings were misidentified, so it is notable that the ones spotted over Wright Patterson, as with the other U.S. military installations, were seen by trained observers that are equipped with high-end gear to maintain security and to discriminate between friend and foe. We will continue to provide additional details on the Wright Patterson AFB incident and the larger drone incursions story as we get them.

Bunker Talk: Let’s Talk About All The Things We Did And Didn’t Co...	Welcome to a belated Bunker Talk. This is a weekend open discussion post for the best commenting crew on the net, in which we can chat about all the stuff that went on this week that we didn’t cover. We can also talk about the stuff we did or whatever else grabs your interest. In other words, it’s an off-topic thread. Also, a reminder: Prime Directives! If you want to talk politics, do so respectfully and know that there’s always somebody that isn’t going to agree with you. If you have political differences, hash it out respectfully, stick to the facts, and no childish name-calling or personal attacks of any kind. If you can’t handle yourself in that manner, then please, discuss virtually anything else. No drive-by garbage political memes. No conspiracy theory rants. Links to crackpot sites will be axed, too. Trolling and shitposting will not be tolerated. No obsessive behavior about other users. Just don’t interact with folks you don’t like. Do not be a sucker and feed trolls! That’s as much on you as on them. Use the mute button if you don’t like what you see. So unless you have something of quality to say, know how to treat people with respect, understand that everyone isn’t going to subscribe to your exact same worldview, and have come to terms with the reality that there is no perfect solution when it comes to moderation of a community like this, it’s probably best to just move on. Finally, as always, report offenders, please. This doesn’t mean reporting people who don’t share your political views, but we really need your help in this regard. The Bunker is open!

Cockpit Video Of Ukrainian Su-27 Lobbing GBU-39 Small Diameter Bo...	A recently released video from the cockpit of a Ukrainian Air Force Su-27 Flanker provides an unprecedented close-quarters view of the fighter lobbing a salvo of GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs (SDB) toward a Russian target. The U.S.-supplied weapon is part of an armory of Western precision-guided munitions integrated on the Soviet-era Su-27, others including the AGM-88 High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile, or HARM, and the Joint Direct Attack Munition–Extended Range, or JDAM-ER. Remarkable cockpit footage of a Ukrainian Air Force Su-27 Flanker launching a salvo of four US-supplied GBU-39 SDB glide bombs at a Russian target. The Ukrainian Flanker tosses the glide bombs while in a 60+ degree climb. pic.twitter.com/EBhPsFjQyc&mdash; OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) December 13, 2024 The footage shows the Su-27 — painted in a ‘digital’ camouflage scheme — launching a salvo of four of the U.S.-supplied glide bombs, while in a climb, at an angle of around 60 degrees. This maneuver has the effect of increasing the standoff range of the weapon while helping to keep the launching aircraft exposed to air defense threats for a minimal amount of time. It’s something that we’ve come to see regularly over the battlefield, performed by fixed-wing tactical jets and helicopters. An accompanying video purports to show the impacts of the munitions, although it cannot be verified that these are the results of the same engagement. While Ukrainian Su-27s have been employing SDBs in combat for some time, they have only rarely been seen with the weapons attached, using the BRU-61/A rack, designed to hold up to four of these 250-pound-class weapons.

In previous images of MiG-29s carrying SDBs, we’ve also been able to observe a special pylon with what may be a white-colored antenna or sensor, mounted at the front. It appears the Su-27 in the latest video lacks that feature on the pylon, or it might only appear under the opposite wing. In the past, we surmised that this could be connected with an electronic countermeasures system, seen in the photo below, which you can read more about in this previous feature. A GBU-39/B-armed MiG-29. Three SDBs are loaded on a standard BRU-61/A rack, which is designed to hold up to four of these 250-pound-class weapons. @air_winged via X The Ukrainian military first disclosed it had begun employing air-launched SDBs in May. In terms of integration of the weapon, the SDB, in common with other Western missiles and precision-guided bombs, is combined with an iPad, or similar tablets-like device, mounted in the cockpit to actually employ the weapon. In addition to SDBs and the JDAM-ER, Ukraine’s glide-bomb arsenal includes French-made rocket-assisted AASM-250 Hammers, which you can read more about here. Ukraine’s use of the SDB, as well as other Western standoff precision weapons, mirrors Russia’s extensive employment of glide bombs of various types. While Russian standoff bombs have been a particular problem for Ukrainian air defenses, recent reports suggest that their effectiveness has started to drop off. A Russian UMPK-series glide bomb strapped on a Su-34 Fullback strike fighter. Russian Ministry of Defense According to the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Russian attacks against Ukraine using guided aerial bombs have fallen by half, since Western partners allowed Kyiv to strike targets deep within Russia using long-range missiles. As a result, Russian tactical airpower has increasingly been pushed back to bases further from the front lines, impacting maintenance, sortie rates, and flight hours, which in turn reduced the number of sorties of this kind. As for the SDB, this continues to provide Ukraine with a powerful tool for attacking targets at standoff ranges of up to around 46 miles with high accuracy. In the scenario shown in the video, with a pop-up launch at lower altitude, the range would be much reduced.

At the same time, individual aircraft can be loaded with multiple SDBs, allowing more targets to be struck per sortie — as in the latest video. Earlier reports suggested that the SDB has also proven notably resilient to jamming. According to an article in The Washington Post earlier this year, citing confidential internal Ukrainian assessments, 'nearly 90 percent of dropped [Small Diameter Bombs] struck their target.' An SDB immediately before hitting a mock hardened aircraft shelter during a test. U.S. Air Force The bombs are designed to penetrate semi-hardened static targets. They have been tasked heavily in support of the Kursk operation, especially for destroying bridges, including temporary ones. Another major advantage is the significant stocks of the weapon held by NATO allies. With that in mind, more insights into the Ukrainian Air Force’s operations with the Small Diameter Bomb, used by both the MiG-29 and Su-27, may well emerge in the future.

There’s A Growing Market For Counter-Drone Systems For Superyacht...	While aerial drone attacks on maritime vessels have thus far focused on commercial and naval ships, there is growing concern that quarter-billion dollar-plus superyachts, and the VIPs who own and cruise in them, may be vulnerable. Similar small unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) used by ambitious paparazzi to photograph the vessels and people of the superyacht scene for over a decade have proven deadly when weaponized in Ukraine and elsewhere as The War Zone has frequently chronicled. This reality has created a small, but growing market for counter-UAS (CUAS) systems for superyachts. Over the last five years, a number of firms have begun to offer CUAS capabilities for ultra-luxury vessels, including London/Monaco-based MARSS, which recently completed the installation of its NiDAR CUAS systems on an undisclosed 400-foot (120m) superyacht and its 230-foot (70m) 'support vessel.' The installation cost approximately $4M and builds upon four previous NiDAR systems integrated by the company on new-build and existing superyachts in 2023. As costly as such systems are, a small, but increasing number of owners figure they’re worth it. (MARSS) Their calculus is set against the broader superyacht business, which is down slightly this year, but that has boomed over the last several years as global wealth has continued to concentrate and the global pandemic attached new value to both seclusion and seizing pleasure while one can. According to a feature in The New Yorker, the number of private yachts over 250 feet (76m) in length climbed from less than ten in 1990 to well over 120 in 2022. The largest of them (sometimes called megayachts or gigayachts) rival or exceed naval destroyers in length with hulls longer than 500 feet (152m). To go with their size, superyachts are owned by people with pull – business moguls, royals, top celebrities, and oligarchs. These people host equally high-profile and some very powerful but lower-profile individuals aboard their lavish vessels. Some of these figures can be major targets. In addition, these yachts have to travel through tough global neighborhoods to reach their destinations and they are clearly prime targets, even symbolic ones, themselves.

(Photo by Peter Fox - Formula 1/Formula 1 via Getty Images) JK SPORTSPHOTOGRAPHY So needless to say, security is already top of mind. This has long been the case in the Middle East where superyachts owned and operated by royal families or governments blur the line between private and state capabilities. The VIP/force protection for some yacht owners in the region has seen military capabilities deployed as part of standard protection. Lower-profile owners commonly employ highly experienced security teams for their superyachts. Such teams offer direct protection, risk mitigation planning, and the kind of threat assessment expertise that may convince an owner to acquire a counter-drone system. Privacy Or Protection MARSS’ end-to-end, detect to defeat CUAS solution is offered for fixed-site land and mobile applications, pairing the firm’s proprietary AI-enabled NiDAR command/control software, and user interface with vendor-supplied sensors (radar, electro-optical/thermal), countermeasures, and effectors. It has been available for several years and gained major market share in the Middle East according to MARSS vice president of business development, Josh Harman. In fact, the company’s NiDAR platform was integrated into the recent joint U.S./Saudi Arabia Red Sands 24.2 CUAS exercise as the central C2 and sensor fusion software in a layered defense. MARSS offers its scalable NiDAR solution for CUAS needs, which can incorporate various sensors and effectors based on the threat requirements. (MARSS) MARSS’ maritime CUAS features the same NiDAR C2 and sensor fusion but with an important difference. While it employs radar, optical, and passive radio frequency (RF) sensors along with software infused with AI to detect and classify UASs, it does not include any ‘soft-kill’ or kinetic drone-defeat countermeasures. That’s because such mitigation features aren’t explicitly legal for private vessels, Frederik Giepmans, managing director for MARSS Maritime told TWZ in an interview. While international maritime conventions like the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) or the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) currently say little about the permissibility of drone-defeat systems on commercial vessels or yachts, the laws of the respective flag-countries under which they operate generally prohibit passive or active drone defenses on these platforms. Laws within different territorial waters come into play as well. However, the prohibitions on drone mitigation have not prevented the emergence of a superyacht CUAS market. Giepmans acknowledges that owners are reluctant to discuss the threat of airborne drones to the privacy or safety of their vessels but they have been quietly buying systems from MARSS, United Kingdom-based Drone Defence, and CACI among others. NiDAR C2 interface in action. (MARSS) MARSS maritime counter-drone system can utilize Echodyne radars, Aaronia passive RF sensors, and Current Science Corporation EO/IR cameras to detect small to midsize UAS at ranges out to about 12 miles (20km). MARSS points out that its NiDAR system is sensor agnostic so detection ranges will vary depending on what sensors are installed with the chosen suite. It’s worth noting that MARSS seeks to offer comprehensive threat awareness for superyachts with its NiDAR 4D suite which, in addition to airborne drones, detects surface and underwater threats (UUVs/divers) using a variety of radar, optical, thermal, and sonar sensors. (MARSS) NiDAR’s proprietary AI handles UAS classification using video/radar/passive RF behavior pattern recognition, object data points, event history analysis, and other inputs. Once an airborne target is detected and identified, alerts are relayed to the yacht’s crew via the NiDAR user interface. Responses may include getting owners and guests below decks and into safe interior spaces and notifying local authorities of drone activity. Despite the questionable legality of using drone-defeat systems, jamming or kinetic actions by a yacht with the right equipment are possible. When pressed, MARSS Maritime’s managing director acknowledged that some owners have acquired active drone-defeat capabilities to go with CUAS detection though not from MARSS he says. Simon Rowland, CEO of Veritas International, a United Kingdom-based private security firm that provides ex-military security personnel, cybersecurity, and other technical security services to the luxury yacht market, agrees. 'There are routes to installing the other half of the system, but you’ve got to find the right sort of place. There are export control issues for one, but I imagine there are creative routes to market,' he says. However, going to such lengths is rare and generally superfluous with respect to current threats Rowland asserts. For the time being, drone threats to superyachts appear to be limited to threats to privacy, not physical harm. Rowland adds that he doesn’t know of any superyacht that has experienced an aggressive physical threat from airborne drones. 'That’s not to say it hasn’t happened. I’m just not aware of anything. There’s no trend I would say.' The U.S. Coast Guard apparently hasn’t identified a trend either. In response to a query regarding reports of unwanted drone activity around large yachts, a USCG spokesman offered The War Zone a somewhat cryptic reply. 'The Coast Guard does not have any readily available data on specific ‘unauthorized small UAS’ near large recreational vessels.' In the often secretive world of superyachts, it can be difficult to divine hidden concerns but both Rowland and Giepmans told The War Zone that in their view there is as yet no collective industry acceptance that airborne drone threats will become a widely standard conversation. The super-yacht Savannah in Portland Port.(Photo by Finnbarr Webster/Getty Images) Finnbarr Webster Joshua Hutchinson managing director at Ambrey, another United Kingdom-based maritime security firm with a focus on commercial shipping, says that when the Houthi threat to shipping in the Red Sea emerged in late 2023, 'there was an initial burst of [CUAS system] inquiries, both from commercial shipping and the private yacht market.' Interest has cooled, he says, adding that Ambrey has tested several CUAS detection systems like MARRS’ in the Red Sea but has not evaluated drone defeat systems. The reason is that given the generally line-of-sight ranges at which small UAS operate, Hutchinson sees them as less of a threat to privacy or security in open water and more of an issue while commercial vessels or superyachts are in or near port. Hutchinson also points out that for less common, larger fixed-wing drones that fly at higher speeds, say between which fly at 90 to 185 mph (150-300 kph), most CUAS systems’ detection ranges (3-6 miles, 5-10km) afford only 15 to 20 seconds notice of a target and its direction, narrowing effective mitigation responses considerably. 'Your response time is extremely small and human error is vast,' he says. A Shahed-136 recorded by a perusing Ukrainian Mi-8. Fixed-wing extended-range drones can fly faster over long distances, making them harder to defeat and predict. (Ukrainian Air Force screencap) Surface threats, whether piracy or terror, with manned or unmanned vessels, have longer detection timelines, offer better visual cues, and are easier to track thanks to approach speeds generally less than 15 mph (25 kph). Vessels can identify potential surface threats more easily and take evasive action. This could include deploying armed security teams and firing warning shots, if a vessel is hosting them, or otherwise denying a surface vessel a chance to close. 'We’ve seen that with the unmanned surface vessels launched by the Houthis and with pirates,' Hutchinson attests. The implication is that counter-manned/unmanned surface systems are likely more effective for both commercial vessels and superyachts than CUAS systems. - Moment a Houthi USV struck the British oil tanker, Cordelia Moon. The security team on board missed every shot. - RN pic.twitter.com/O7ToDgUh0r&mdash; Zlatti71 (@Zlatti_71) October 2, 2024 Thus far, Ambrey has yet to see a maritime CUAS system come to market that can guarantee effective drone defeat in all circumstances for superyachts or commercial vessels Hutchinson adds, suggesting the most effective mitigation still lies in early assessment of risk and changing operational procedures (altering course, turning off AIS, limiting signal emissions) to avoid it. However, CUAS systems are being sold to private owners in part because of the operational predictability of the superyacht world. In the summer yachts flock to Monaco, the French Riviera, the Greek and Aegean islands, and other southern European locales stretching East to the Levant. In winter they migrate to a handful of popular Caribbean anchorages, to Miami, and a few locations to the north of South America. Yachts are moored at the Hercules Port in Monaco on September 22, 2021, during the 30th edition of the International Monaco Yacht Show. - The Monaco Yacht Show is considered the most prestigious pleasure boat show in the world with the exhibition of 500 major companies in luxury yachting and featuring over a hundred super and megayachts. (Photo by Valery HACHE / AFP) (Photo by VALERY HACHE/AFP via Getty Images) VALERY HACHE At each of these, they are generally within sight of land and the line-of-sight range of small drones. They’re static, at the pier or riding at anchor in a harbor, magnifying opportunities for snooping or malfeasance. They can also be located with ease. 'What people always forget about the shipping industry,' Hutchinson observes, 'is that we’ve created this culture of readily available public information. You can download an [automatic identification system (AIS)] app on your phone in 30 seconds and track 90,000 ships for free.' Or you can go online to sites like ShipLocation.com, which has a 'superyachts tracker.' The perceived vulnerabilities may be enough to convince a yacht owner to install a CUAS system. Nevertheless, Simon Rowland says he doesn’t think security firms like Veritas or yacht builders want to 'go down the route of selling fear'. 'I think there’s a reluctance to highlight a potential significant threat before that threat materializes.' But he acknowledges that the threat of drones, whether to privacy or yacht security, is rising. 'We are on a sliding scale and it isn’t [diminishing], it’s sliding up, getting greater.' The Vanity Market Even if owners are concerned about the possibility of prowling UAVs, there’s another obstacle to selling CUAS systems to the superyacht crowd, Rowland affirms. It’s how they look. 'The last thing an owner would like to do is to strap on to their beautifully-designed yacht an ugly piece of equipment to deal with a threat which may or may not materialize. There’s an element of vanity in the [yacht] market.' Aesthetic concerns are well known to MARSS and other providers who have worked in recent years to both decrease the size, weight and power (SWaP) requirements of CUAS systems and to blend them into superyacht profiles. 'This is of high importance,' Giepmans agrees. 'When it comes to placing sensors it is imperative that they fit in with the overall appearance and design of the yacht. This is done through custom mounting solutions, color schemes and placing sensors within radomes where possible.' The ball-style radomes seen on any number of superyachts built in the last decade, usually located high atop their superstructures, can sometimes accommodate additional sensors or subtly cloak sensors placed near them. Others (cameras, passive radio antennas) can be discreetly placed on the wings which often adorn masts atop the vessels. A rendering showing a CUAS sensor system on a yacht mast that incorporates EO/IR cameras with microwave radar arrays. (MARSS) There is another aspect of appearances that may carry weight. Superyacht owners exist within a culture of one-upmanship. If the yacht next to yours at Cap d’Antibes is rumored to have a sophisticated counter-UAS system, you may feel the need to acquire your own to keep pace. And when money is not an object, why wouldn’t you have that feature just like all the others on your massive yacht and, more increasingly often, the toy-packed support vessels that shadow them? The pressure to provide UAS detection and countermeasures for superyachts may eventually extend beyond the vessels themselves, Hutchinson says. 'Where do you put the pressure? Is the onus on the owner/operators or do you put it on the ports, forcing them to change their ISPS codes [International Ship and Port Facility Security Code] to say that ‘we are a secure UAV environment?'

(Photo by Sabri Kesen/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) Anadolu The odds that superyacht owners and their guests are considered important enough that they might one day enjoy drone-free zones in various ports could change the calculus for acquiring CUAS systems but it remains only a future possibility, not a given. Similarly, owners face a conundrum when considering adding drone detection to their yachts to ensure privacy or protection - should they buy today or buy tomorrow? 'Do you buy the latest tech or do you wait?' Hutchinson asks. 'Where are you operating? What’s your threat and security risk assessment? If you’re concerned, you’re going to be making a high investment into relatively new tech. But in two to three years’ time I think [CUAS acquisition] will be business as usual.' Simon Rowland takes a slightly different view, averring that decision-making based on privacy and security risks is often made by others with the general approval of superyacht owners. 'It’s a nuanced and complicated part of yacht ownership. For the most part, owners farm these discussions away to other people&#8230; within the build process or within the organization that’s overseeing the build.' Giepmans says that yacht builders are slowly integrating CUAS systems into the construction process of their vessels, consulting with firms like MARSS when owners specify inclusion.

(Photo by Valery HACHE / AFP) (Photo by VALERY HACHE/AFP via Getty Images) VALERY HACHE There’s one thing that MARRS’ Giepmans, Veritas’ Rowland, and Ambrey’s Hutchinson all agree on. One publicly acknowledged UAS attack on a yacht would change everything, rapidly propelling the market. 'I think the market for counter-UAV is just starting,' Hutchinson concludes. 'Especially in the private market, these kinds of systems will be built-in. There’ll be an expectation that you can have jamming, that you can protect privacy as well as security.' The transformation that UAS have wrought on the battlefields of Ukraine, Gaza, Lebanon, the Red Sea, and elsewhere is spilling over to many other areas of modern security, creating both risks and fortunes. The direct technology and enabling technologies that have made it a reality have been shepherded by some of the very people who have acquired superyachts in the last few years. A slowly growing group of them are buying CUAS systems for their vessels. 'The irony is inescapable,' Rowland observes.

Russian Forces Appear To Be Pulling Out Of Prized Syrian Air Base	There are clear signs that Russian forces, including an S-400 surface-to-air missile system, are withdrawing from Khmeimim Air Base in Syria. At the same time, authorities in Russia continue to insist that no final decisions have been made about the future of their presence at Khmeimim or their naval base in Tartus since the fall of their long-time ally Bashar Al Assad last weekend. These are highly strategic and irreplaceable locations the Kremlin uses to project military power well beyond Syria. Satellite imagery taken today of Khmeimim (also written Hmeimim) that The War Zone obtained from Maxar provides the latest evidence that a withdrawal of at least some Russian forces from the base is underway now. As seen at the top of this story and below, two very large An-124 airlifters are prominently visible at the base with their noses open, appearing to be ready to load cargo. There are also three Il-76 Candid cargo planes parked on a large open apron at the northeast end of the facility. Satellite image ©2024 Maxar Technologies At least one of the Il-76s presently at Khmeimim is a Syrian Airlines aircraft and a Yakovlev Yak-40 airliner, which the Syrian flag carrier also has in its inventory, looks to be parked next to it. Smaller An-72 Coaler and An-26 Curl transports, as well as a Su-35 Flanker-E fighter, are also seen in the imagery. There may be more tactical jets under the row of shelters at the northeastern end of the base. A broader look at the northern end of Khmeimim Air Base as seen on December 13, 2024. Satellite image ©2024 Maxar Technologies The Maxar images also show Russian forces are packing up the S-400 surface-to-air missile site at Khmeimim, as well as other air defense assets. What looks to be a Ka-52 attack helicopter is also seen with its rotor blades removed, likely for transport.

This pointed to plans to load it onto the aircraft for movement elsewhere. Other elements of the S-400 system at Khmeimim were still visible in their emplacements, but did not appear to be in a deployed mode. For instance, transport erector launchers were seen in travel configurations with their missile tubes down, as well. All of this is in line with what is seen in the new Maxar imagery.

As The War Zone has previously noted, moving ships out of Tartus is a prudent force protection measure given the current fluidity of the situation in Syria. Even if major rebel groups have given the Kremlin certain security guarantees, the ships would have still be huge and relatively defenseless targets sitting pierside. The Syria TV footage of Khmeimim only underscores the current unprecedented freedom of access in Syria after decades of the country being a brutal totalitarian police state, as well as the potential risks this brings to Russian bases in the country. The War Zone reports often about the ever-growing threat of drone attacks, including ones launched by actors relatively close by, especially on air bases and other critical facilities, in general. A mass drone attack on Khmeimim in 2018 was a major herald of things to come and the base has a long history of being subjected to indirect fire of various kinds by rebel forces. The departure of air defense assets from Khmeimim, especially point-defense systems, will only increase the vulnerability of that base to aerial threats. That, in turn, could point to more serious withdrawal plans. Even if Russia ultimately retains its bases in Syria, it is still very possible that its overall force posture in the country could change, as well.

Removing SHORAD from Khmeimin Air Base is only something the Russian forces would do if they are leaving the base. pic.twitter.com/VA7mg4QpcI&mdash; Oliver Alexander (@OAlexanderDK) December 13, 2024 As The War Zone has stressed before, Russia losing Khmeimim and Tartus would be a huge blow to Russia with ramifications well beyond Syria. Assad has essentially gifted the facilities to the Russian government through a 49-year 'lease' deal in 2017 and the Kremlin has invested considerable resources in expanding them since then. The bases offer highly strategic nodes for projecting air and naval power into the Mediterranean, including along NATO's southern flank, and into Africa, as well as elsewhere in the Middle East. Tartus is especially significant because it is the Russian Navy's only current warm-water port facility with direct access to the Mediterranean, but Khmeimim is also a uniquely positioned operating location for the country's air force. The Russians are starting to get very nervous… They write that the loss of Syria as a refueling and logistics point undermines all of Russia's efforts on the African continent. pic.twitter.com/s4h5hWVgBk&mdash; MAKS 24 (@Maks_NAFO_FELLA) December 9, 2024 Bloomberg reported earlier today that Russia's Foreign Ministry 'believes it has an informal understanding' with the new transitional government emerging in Damascus, which rebel group Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) is leading, about keeping Khmeimim and Tartus. There have been previous reports that Russian authorities secured guarantees of access to both facilities, at least for some amount of time, during talks with various regional actors about the political transition ongoing in Syria. 'The bases are still there, where they were on Syrian territory,' Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov told reporters earlier this week, according to the country's Interfax news agency. 'No other decisions have been made for the moment.' 'They [the bases] were there at the Syrians' request with the aim of fighting terrorists from the Islamic State [IS]. I am proceeding on the basis of the notion that everyone agrees that the fight against terrorism, and what remains of IS, is not over,' Bogdanov added. '[That] requires collective efforts and in this connection, our presence and the Khmeimim base played an important role in the context of the overall fight against international terrorism.' Though Bogdanov's remarks here about the purpose of Russia's presence in Syria, which was central to keeping Assad safe from rebel groups not aligned with ISIS, are farcical, it does raise the possibility of the Kremlin trying to rebrand its role as part of a pitch to keep the bases. There have already been reports that Russian authorities are softening their tone toward HTS. Russia, as well as the United States, the United Kingdom, and others, have formally designated HTS as a terrorist group. The U.S. government still has a $10 million bounty out on HTS leader Ahmed Hussein Al Shar’a, better known by his nom de guerre Abu Mohammad Al Jolani (or simply as Jolani), as well. HTS leader Ahmed Hussein Al Shar’a (aka Abu Mohammad Al Jolani) addresses a crowd at the capital's landmark Umayyad Mosque on December 8, 2024. Aref TAMMAWI / AFP via Getty Images As The War Zone has noted in its previous reporting, Russia's position is complicated by its very active support for Assad. The Russian military's invention starting in 2015 was critical to saving the regime from rebels, including those that evolved into HTS, and keeping it in power. Russia's forces were still launching strikes on the same HTS-led forces it is now negotiating with just days before the regime's final collapse. Assad is also said to be in Russia, but he has not been publicly seen anywhere in more than a week now. Overall the situation across Syria is extremely complex, with multiple rebel factions jostling for control of different regions amid a lack of present centralized authority. U.S.-backed Kurdish forces are now openly fighting with Turkish-supported groups, with American authorities reportedly trying to mediate the situation. There are separate growing fears about ISIS and other terrorist groups exploiting the chaotic situation. At least for now though, there are clear indications that at least some Russian forces are leaving the country and that others are getting in position to withdraw.

U.S. Air Force Confirms Drone Sightings Over Ramstein Air Base In...	Germany is the latest country to report mysterious drone activity over an air base on its territory, specifically the sprawling U.S. facility at Ramstein, alongside similar incidents over critical industrial sites. The developments follow previous suspicious drone flights reported over infrastructure in Germany and a spate of security incidents at other air bases in the country earlier this year. Since then, U.S. Air Force facilities in England have also reported multiple drone incursions, which so far remain unexplained, while the United States is now deep into a wave of drone hysteria after similar reports out of bases on the East Coast. 'Possible spy drones' have been noted 'several times' flying over Ramstein Air Base, the main U.S. Air Force hub in Western Europe, according to a story today published by the Spiegel news magazine, citing a confidential report by German security authorities. Other similar incidents have been reported in the vicinity of the chemical company BASF, headquartered in Ludwigshafen, and the defense firm Rheinmetall. These companies are based in Rhineland-Palatinate, southwestern Germany — the same state in which Ramstein is located.

The Ramstein incidents have been confirmed by the U.S. military, with a spokeswoman for the base telling the Spiegel: 'In early December, there were several sightings of small unmanned aerial systems in the area and over Ramstein Air Base, they had no impact on the residents of the base and on the facilities and military equipment there.' The spokeswoman confirmed that the base is now 'in close coordination' with the German authorities regarding the incident. Ramstein Air Base in Germany. Google Earth As for Rheinmetall, this company has been at the forefront of German defense support for Ukraine since the full-scale invasion by Russia in 2022. The firm describes itself as 'Ukraine’s most important defense industry partner in the fight against Russian aggression.'

However, there have been reports of unexplained drone activity in Germany dating back to this summer. In particular, there were reports from the north of Germany, including over an industrial park in Brunsbüttel, northwest of Hamburg, which is home to a major floating liquid natural gas (LNG) terminal. At the time, prosecutors in Germany said they considered it likely the drone flights were related to 'espionage activity for sabotage purposes' and also cited 'repeated' drone flights over 'critical infrastructure.' Reports of drone flights over Brunsbüttel began on August 8 and it’s been claimed that the craft have proven difficult to track due to their high speeds —reportedly around 60 miles per hour — and their approach from the sea.

Photo by Axel Heimken/picture alliance via Getty Images picture alliance The local public prosecutor’s office launched an investigation into the Brunsbüttel incidents, on suspicion of 'agent activity for sabotage purposes.' The same topic was discussed by the German Interior Ministry, but they were unable to agree on a joint approach to countering the spy flights, the Spiegel. Other unusual activity in Germany in recent months includes a security alert at Geilenkirchen Air Base in August, which you can read more about here. This was due to fears of a possible Russian drone attack, according to a German media report. An unnamed source within German intelligence confirmed that the security scare at Geilenkirchen was caused by signs 'of preparatory actions for a likely Russian act of sabotage' using a drone, the Deutsche Presse-Agentur reported today. The tip-off reportedly came from an undisclosed foreign intelligence service.

'The word Russia was never mentioned. We talked about a threat caused by drones,' a NATO spokesperson at Geilenkirchen told Reuters. The drone scare at Geilenkirchen followed a security alert the previous week, in response to reports of an attempted trespassing incident at the base. This came at the same time as fears of possible sabotage of the water supply at nearby Wahn Barracks. A full sweep was made of the premises at Geilenkirchen without finding any trespassers, while the Wahn Barracks incident proved to be a false alarm. While there has been no evidence of Russia being behind these incidents in Germany, they have all led to speculation about possible Kremlin involvement. This comes amid growing concerns of Russian-inspired aggression against Germany, including drones, but also involving various other ‘hybrid warfare’ tactics. Meanwhile, however, there’s no doubt that Germany — and its military bases — have been directly targeted. In April of this year, two German-Russian nationals were arrested in Germany on suspicion of plotting sabotage attacks, including on U.S. military facilities in the country. One of those individuals was accused of making plans to carry out bomb and arson attacks on military facilities and had allegedly taken photos and videos of military transports and equipment. The sabotage attacks appear to have been a direct response to the war in Ukraine, in which Germany has been a key backer of Kyiv, alongside the U.S. military in Germany, which uses bases there for transshipment, as well as training Ukrainian soldiers there. One of the targets of the sabotage attacks was the U.S. Army’s Grafenwoehr base in the southern state of Bavaria, where Ukrainian soldiers are trained to use U.S.-supplied M1 Abrams tanks.

Photo by Matthias Merz/picture alliance via Getty Images picture alliance In the wake of these arrests, U.S. military bases across Europe — including in Germany — were placed on a heightened state of alert, 'for the first time in a decade,' according to CNN. This move was said to be in response to intelligence concerns about possible sabotage attacks by Russian-backed actors. For its part, NATO has issued explicit warnings about the risk of an expanding Kremlin-backed campaign of sabotage, including cyberattacks. Speaking in June, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg outlined what he said was evidence of 'a surge of sabotage, cyberattacks, instrumentalized migration, and other hostile actions by Russia.'

Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images Kevin Dietsch TWZ has previously examined exactly why a hybrid warfare campaign might be especially attractive for Russia. Above all, this kind of warfare can be waged at a relatively low cost and with reduced risk — at least to the Kremlin. Undertaken in Europe, it would very likely be intended to undermine support for Ukraine by creating disruption and sowing fear. Especially important is the fact that, as long as proxies are being used, such activities are very difficult to be directly traced directly back to the Kremlin. Using relatively low-cost drones to cause disruption or even outright destruction of assets at air bases is by now a well-established tactic in conflict zones including the Middle East and the war in Ukraine. We have seen now even short-range drones, launched from fairly close to an air base, can have a significant impact. NATO air bases in Germany (and the United Kingdom) are also very poorly defended against these kinds of threats and regulatory/legal issues stand in the way of using available active defenses in many circumstances. A graphic showing elements of the United Kingdom’s Orcus counter-drone suite, as offered to the U.S. Air Force to help defend air bases and other facilities in England. Crown Copyright As for the situation in the United States, recent reports of drone sightings highlight what is very much a credible national security issue, although the situation there has been clouded by patchy government messaging and frenzied responses both from social media accounts and much of the mainstream media. With relations between Russia and the West still in a very precarious state and hybrid warfare very much in the ascendancy, air bases and other critical infrastructure in Europe could become the front lines of a new kind of war being fought in parallel to the conflict in Ukraine.

Army’s Dark Eagle Hypersonic Missile Finally Blasts Out Of Its La...	The U.S. Army has finally test-fired its Dark Eagle hypersonic missile from its trailer-based launcher, something it has been attempting to do so for some two years now. The service has explicitly blamed problems with the launcher for causing major testing woes that have pushed back plans to field the weapon system by years. The Army's Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office (RCCTO), together with the U.S. Navy Strategic Systems Programs, conducted the test launch from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, according to a Pentagon press release this evening. The missile at the core of Dark Eagle, also known as the Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW), is the same one the Navy plans to arm its Zumwalt class stealth destroyers and future Block V Virginia class submarines with. The two services have been working together to develop their respective systems. You can read more about the Navy's progress on its Intermediate Range Conventional Prompt Strike (IRCPS) weapon system here. A close-up look at the common missile fired during the first successful test involving the Dark Eagle launcher. A fairing of some kind is visible along the side toward the nose end. DOD 'This is the second successful end-to-end flight test of the [common] All Up Round (AUR) [missile] this year and was the first live-fire event for the Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon system using a Battery Operations Center and a Transporter Erector Launcher,' according to the Pentagon release, which does not explicitly say when the test occurred. A Dark Eagle launcher seen at a previous training exercise. US Army However, spotters were able to use publicly available warning notices, flight tracking data, and NASA camera feeds from Cape Canaveral to catch the launch occurring earlier today. Online flight tracking shows that one of NASA's WB-57F aircraft, a Navy NP-3D range support plane, and two specially modified High Altitude Observatory (HALO) Gulfstream business jets operated by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) were airborne at the time. All of these aircraft regularly make appearances during hypersonic and other missile testing, among other research and development and test and evaluation activities.

'This test marks an important milestone in the development of one of our most advanced weapons systems. As we approach the first delivery of this capability to our Army partners, we will continue to press forward to integrate Conventional Prompt Strike into our Navy surface and subsurface ships to help ensure we remain the world's preeminent fighting force,' Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro said in his own statement. 'This test is a demonstration of the successful Navy and Army partnership that has allowed us to develop a transformational hypersonic weapon system that will deliver unmatched capability to meet joint warfighting needs,' Navy Vice Adm. Johnny R. Wolfe Jr, Director, Navy's Strategic Systems Programs, which is leading work on the common AUR, added. The common missile, or All Up Round (AUR), being developed for Dark Eagle and IRCPS consists of two main components, a two-stage rocket booster with an unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicle on top. As designed, the missile gets the conical 'vehicle' to an optimal speed and altitude before releasing it, after which it glides down to its target at hypersonic speeds, defined as anything above Mach 5, and along a relatively shallow, atmospheric flight path, maneuvering erratically along the way. The Army has previously said the weapon's peak speed is at least Mach 17 and its maximum range is in excess of 1,725 miles (2,775 kilometers).

GAO A graphic giving a general breakdown of the common missile for the Dark Eagle/LRHW and IRCPS systems, as well as the division of labor between the Army and the Navy. GAO 'Hypersonic systems… provide a combination of speed, maneuverability, and altitude that enables highly survivable, medium and intermediate-range, rapid defeat of time-critical, heavily-defended targets,' a U.S. defense official told The War Zone after another test event earlier this year. 'The services common hypersonic AUR supports the National Defense Strategy and will provide combatant commanders with diverse capabilities to sustain and strengthen integrated deterrence and to build enduring advantages for the Joint Force.' While firing a missile from the Dark Eagle launcher is a major milestone, the fact that it has only come now underscores the problems that have been dogging the system's development for years now. The Army scrubbed three planned launches last year. The Pentagon did announce a successful end-to-end common AUR test in June, but that had made use of a different ground-based launch apparatus. A picture from the successful test launch of the common AUR in June. DOD 'The U.S. Army and Navy recently initiated a test of a conventional hypersonic system at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida,' a U.S. defense official told The War Zone in a statement in July, but offered no further details at the time. Thanks to today's Pentagon press release, which says the test involving the Dark Eagle launcher was the 'second successful end-to-end flight test of the All Up Round (AUR) this year,' we now at least know whatever happened in July did not involve an end-to-end demonstration of the common Dark Eagle/IRCPS missile. As noted, the Army has blamed past Dark Eagle testing woes on unspecified issues with the launcher rather than the missile. When Dark Eagle might actually enter service is still an open question. 'Based on current test and missile production plans, the Army will not field its first complete LRHW battery until fiscal year 2025,' the Government Accountability Office, a Congressional watchdog, said in a report released in June. Fiscal Year 2025 began on October 1. The Army had previously hoped to have a prototype battery start live-fire testing of Dark Eagle in Fiscal Year 2022 and field, at least on a limited level, in Fiscal Year 2023. The initial Dark Eagle unit – Battery B, 5th Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery (Long Range Fires Battalion), part of the 1st Multi-Domain Task Force (MDTF) – has already been activated at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington State. Another view of a Dark Eagle launcher. US Army Capt. Ryan DeBooy After the ostensible cancellation of the U.S. Air Force's AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW) program last year, Dark Eagle had looked set to be the U.S. military first operational novel hypersonic weapon. There is still some uncertainty surrounding ARRW status and there may be plans for a follow-on effort, if it hasn't already begun in the classified realm. The U.S. military as a whole has and continues to stress the importance of developing and fielding hypersonic boost-glide vehicle weapons, as well as air-breathing hypersonic cruise missiles, to ensure its ability to successfully prosecute various targets set on land and at sea going forward. These capabilities are seen as especially critical for success in a potential future high-end fight in the Pacific against China. There are also now plans for 'episodic deployments' of ground-based hypersonic and other long-range missile systems to Europe. The Navy hopes to begin at least live-fire testing of its IRCPS system from the USS Zumwalt, which is in the final stages of being modified to fire the missiles and just recently returned to the water after months in dry dock (as seen below), in the current fiscal year. It remains to be seen now if Dark Eagle's path to an operational capability is more clear-cut following its first successful launch using the trailer-based launcher, but it certainly is a good sign that the program can move forward toward fielding.

White House Says None Of The New Jersey Visual Drone Sightings Ha...	Federal, state, and local authorities have not been able to corroborate any claimed visual sightings of mysterious drones over New Jersey, according to a top White House spokesperson. In addition, authorities have assessed that many of the purported uncrewed aerial systems spotted overhead are actually innocuous crewed aircraft like airliners. At the same time, the U.S. government does not appear to have collected any imagery of its own of reported drones in the skies above the state and cannot conclusively categorize all of the reported sightings. All of this underscores The War Zone's previous reporting about how there may still be a credible national security issue unfolding, but the discourse around the situation has been blurred heavily by hysteria fueled by poor government messaging, as well as social media accounts and major part of the mainstream media that are propagating sightings of typical aircraft and labeling them as mysterious drones. John Kirby, White House National Security Communications Advisor, spoke directly about the reported drone sightings over and around New Jersey at a routine press conference today. John Kirby on drone activity in and around New Jersey: 'We have no evidence at this time that the reported drone sightings pose a national security or a public safety threat or have a foreign nexus&#8230; We have not been able to&#8230;corroborate any of the reported visual sightings.' pic.twitter.com/xfxFaJQUaN&mdash; CSPAN (@cspan) December 12, 2024 'We have no evidence at this time that the reported drone sightings pose a national security or a public safety threat, or have a foreign nexus. The Department of Homeland Security and the FBI are investigating these sightings, and they're working closely with state and local law enforcement to provide resources using numerous detection methods to better understand their origin,' Kirby said. 'Using very sophisticated electronic detection technologies provided by federal authorities, we have not been able to – and neither have state or local law enforcement authorities – corroborate any of the reported visual sightings.' 'To the contrary, upon review of available imagery, it appears that many of the reported sightings are actually manned aircraft that are being operated lawfully,' he continued. 'The United States Coast Guard is providing support to the state of New Jersey and has confirmed that there is no evidence of any foreign-based involvement from coastal vessels, and, importantly, there are no reported or confirmed drone sightings in any restricted airspace.' 'I'm not aware that we have U.S. government-produced imagery ourselves, but as I said in my opening statement, we have certainly done a thorough analysis of the existing imagery,' Kirby did add later on in the press conference in response to follow-up questions. 'The analysis, thus far, in an investigation that is ongoing, has not revealed any national security or malicious intent or criminal activity.' White House National Security Advisor John Kirby says the US does not have any of its own imagery of the drones over NJ and NY. He claims the White House is adequately investigating the drones situation and there is no national security threat. pic.twitter.com/y9OnJRbILy&mdash; UAP News (@HighPeaks77) December 12, 2024 What other data U.S. authorities may be examining in their ongoing investigation, beyond that collected using the aforementioned 'sophisticated electronic detection technologies,' is unclear. The full scope of capabilities being employed to try to detect and identify possible drones over New Jersey is unknown, as are how those assets as being specifically tasked in response to individual reports. It's worth noting that basic counter-drone systems use electronic surveillance measures to detect the radio emissions from drones to detect, classify and, in some instances, geolocate them. More advanced but common systems use microwave radars with the ability to also detect non emitting drones and provide better location data. All systems are often tied with an infrared/electro-optical camera system for visual identification and to help searching for drone targets, as well. 'I would remind you, we're at the beginning here, not the end,' he acknowledged. 'There's a lot more work to be done, and we're working closely with state and local authorities to gain more information.' 'I can also tell you that if the President, as Commander in Chief, believed, based on the information that he'd been given that there was a national security threat at play here, or even a public safety threat at play here, he would issue the appropriate directives to not only law enforcement, but perhaps even the military, if that was needed,' Kirby stressed. 'I can't tell you definitively. I cannot characterize for you definitively what these sightings are.' The DHS and FBI also issued a joint statement, seen below, today roughly to the same effect. Today, the @FBI and DHS jointly issued a statement on reported drone sightings in New Jersey pic.twitter.com/kzbmTzjvkr&mdash; Homeland Security (@DHSgov) December 12, 2024 Reports of possible drone sightings in the skies above various parts of New Jersey, which The War Zone was first to report on, have been coming in since November 18. However, Kirby's comments follow a particularly fever-pitched past 48 hours that included a member of Congress claiming on national television that the drones were coming from an 'Iranian mothership' offshore, as you can read in our past reporting here. The Pentagon had already shot down that particular assertion yesterday. There has already been considerable and clear evidence, such as the picture of what is obviously an airliner in the social media post below, that the vast majority of the reporting drone 'sightings' have actually been people spotting commercial aircraft and other completely regular air traffic over New Jersey. An avalanche of these videos and images have been spread on social media with ridiculous claims attached to them. Large drones have been hovering in formation over northern New Jersey, officials say, leading to 'unnerved' residents wondering what's behind these bright, unidentified flying objects appearing almost every night in the sky. NBC News (@NBCNews) December 3, 2024 Kirby's statements, although still guarded in terms of drawing conclusions, are clearly a meant to try to add some clarity to the malestrom of information swirling around in the media and on social channels. The muddled messaging from the U.S. government to date on the New Jersey sightings has drawn public criticism and push-back from officials, especially those within the state. As The War Zone's editor-in-chief Tyler Rogoway wrote on X yesterday: 'The main stream media has no clue what they are talking about on this issue, none, and most outlets largely don't seem to care. Local officials are very poor sources in terms of quality info on this issue. This is not a dig on them at all, it's just there is not an in-house knowledge base there that understands it, just facets of it, not anywhere near a whole picture. This is a very complex issue with many technological facets. You don't just call in a 'drone guy' and get briefed. We have ran into this issue many times.' 'The U.S. gov messaging on this has been so absurdly poor and frankly dangerous &#8230; but that isn't all that surprising. This has been the way it has been for years, but at least the denials have finally evaporated.' 'Nearly every video I have seen has pointed to mass hysteria not a drone invasion of massive scale, with airliners, private jets, and helicopters being portrayed as mysterious objects. These videos are peddled for engagement by a growing number of online accounts. This is very unfortunate, because there does seem to be something going on here, but zero critical thought, even on a most basic level of the 'evidence' only fuels rumors and fear. It also clogs the channels for relevant evidence to break through. This is true on a public consumption and governmental/investigative level. It also puts aircraft in danger.' Mailbox/DMs etc full of people asking why we are not reporting on the drone stuff considering we broke all this over many years. We are! But we have not been doing a play by play as the story has totally gone off the rails with reality and major news stories have developed…&mdash; Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) December 11, 2024 In addition, lawmakers in Washington have expressed their concern over the ongoing drone scare. 'As you know, since late November, communities in the New York City area and northern New Jersey have reported several incidents of unattributable drone sightings at night, alarming both residents and local law enforcement. According to public reports, residents have reported that some of these drones are larger in size compared to other commercially available drone technology,' Senators Cory Booker, Chuck Schumer, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Andy Kim, wrote in an open letter FBI, DHS, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) today. The four lawmakers, who are all Democrats, collectively represent New Jersey and New York in the Senate. 'Some of these drones have been observed maneuvering near critical infrastructure and sensitive locations, including reservoirs and military installations,' that letter, which called for additional briefings on the situation, added. 'In addition to potential privacy concerns raised by these aerial systems, we are also especially concerned about how these drones may harm public safety, especially given recent reports that a medevac helicopter was prevented from transporting a seriously injured patient for care because of the presence of these drones.' Kirby said he stood by his statement, including that there have been 'no reported or confirmed drone sightings in any restricted airspace,' when asked about this portion of the letter. John Kirby, White House National Security Communications Advisor, seen at one point during today's briefing. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images At his press conference today, Kirby was still quick to acknowledge that no matter what is or is not being seen in the skies over New Jersey, it highlights worrisome gaps in the U.S. government's ability to respond to ever-growing drone threats. 'While there is no known malicious activity occurring, the reported sightings there do, however, highlight a gap in authorities,' he said. 'So we urge Congress to pass important legislation that will extend and expand existing counter drone authorities so that we are better prepared to identify and mitigate any potential threats to airports or other critical infrastructure, and so that state and local authorities are provided all the tools that they need to respond to such threats, as well.' The War Zone has written extensively about the often obtuse maze of laws, regulations, and rules that govern who can take what kind of action against uncrewed aerial threats within the U.S. homeland and when. This topic just recently came to the fore again with the roll-out of a new Pentagon-wide counter-drone strategy meant to, in part, streamline the U.S. military's ability to act within the authorities it has already and better interface with other federal, state, and local partners. Counter-drone systems on display at the U.S. military's Falcon Peak 2025 demonstration event at Peterson Space Force Base in Colorado in October 2024. DOD At the same time, as The War Zone has been sounding the alarm for years, the dangers posed by ever-more capable drones are not new, and the U.S. government as a whole has been slow to acknowledge this and continues to lag in taking steps to address the threats. As we also highlight regularly there has been and continues to be substantial overlap in reported sightings of what are now often called unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and drones. Many purported UAPs have been later assessed to likely be uncrewed aerial systems. Overall, as already noted, the bulk of the U.S. government messaging to date on the New Jersey sightings has been, at best, muddled and has already drawn public criticism and push-back from officials, especially those within the state. Kirby's comments today, although brief, do offer important additional details about what is understood to have been going on over New Jersey, but many questions still remain.

Littoral Combat Ships To Sail With Mk70 Vertical Launchers Strapp...	In a significant step toward finally giving the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) fleet greater offensive capabilities, Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro announced Wednesday that 'many' LCS ships will receive the modular Mk 70 Payload Delivery System, allowing the beleaguered LCS to field the type of substantial firepower that has long eluded them. The Mk 70 is a containerized launch system based on the Mk 41 Vertical Launching System (VLS) in use on many American and foreign warships. It can accommodate a variety of missiles, including the versatile Standard Missile-6 (SM-6) and the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM). USS Savannah (LCS 28) conducts a test-fire of a SM-6 missile from a Mk 70 modular missile launcher in 2023. (U.S. Navy) Mk 70 will give the LCS fleet 'tremendous firepower and even more tactical advantage over our adversaries,' Del Toro said during the U.S. Naval Institute’s 2024 Defense Forum in Washington, D.C. Once billed as a critical multi-role component of the Navy's future fleet, the pricey LCS program has involved mission modules that were never fielded, as well as hull crack issues and class-wide propulsion problems that impacted the Independence and Freedom classes, respectively. Such ships have also had limited operational employment. Del Toro's comments this week suggest the sea service is bullish on what the Mk 70 can do to reverse the LCS's fortunes and finally get the ships ready for a higher-end fight, even as questions remain about the LCS's survivability if they are indeed dispatched 'aggressively,' as Del Toro noted. 'LCS is back, Freedom class and Independence class, and we have every intent to deploy them aggressively everywhere around the globe, and the Persian Gulf, obviously, with the mine-sweeping capability and everywhere else it’s needed, particularly in the Pacific with these added capabilities,' Del Toro said. USNI News’ Sam Lagrone was the first to report Del Toro’s remarks. TWZ has reached out to the Navy to get more information on the timeline for the upgrades, and which LCSs will be involved. Such a capability would allow LCS to fire smaller volumes of several types of missiles, and would be particularly important in a Pacific war with China, where larger surface warships outfitted with the Mk 41 would be in high demand. These vessels would defend against air and missile threats, and to help prosecute stand-off strikes against a large number of sea and shore targets. Del Toro’s announcement follows the Navy’s successful test-firing of a SM-6 missile from a Mk 70 launcher placed aboard the Independence class LCS USS Savannah (LCS-28) in October 2023 in the Eastern Pacific Ocean. The SM-6’s striking of a designated target 'demonstrated the modularity and lethality of Littoral Combat Ships and the ability to successfully integrate a containerized weapons system to engage a surface target,' the Navy said at the time. A rendering of the Mk 70 Mod 1 Expeditionary Launcher. (Public Domain) Savannah employed a form of the Mk 70 Mod 1 Expeditionary Launcher for the test, TWZ previously reported. In addition to the SM-6, the system can fire land-attack, anti-ship optimized and other Tomahawk variants. Mk 70 launchers are related to the U.S. Army’s ground-based Typhon system, which fires SM-6s and Tomahawks as well. The Navy has also test-fired a SM-6 from a Mk 70-series launcher aboard the experimental large uncrewed surface vessel Ranger, and has previously demonstrated such launchers in a trailer-mounted configuration during an exercise in Denmark. Lockheed Martin announced in May 2024 that it had successfully test-fired a Patriot PAC-3 MSE interceptor from such a containerized launcher and used it to down a mock cruise missile. A US Navy Mk 70-series launch system mounted on a trailer deployed during an exercise in Denmark in September 2023. (U.S. Navy) TWZ previously laid out what the Mk 70 would offer after the Navy announced Savannah’s successful test-fire: 'The Mk 70 family does offer a relatively simple way to increase the firepower on a wide variety of ships with suitable deck space. This includes smaller surface combatants with helipads like Independence class LCSs, various amphibious warfare, and certain auxiliary support ships, including commercial designs. The containerized launcher provides immense flexibility just with its ability to fire SM-6s and Tomahawks, and its Mk 41 VLS heritage means more munition options could definitely be integrated in the future.' The multi-purpose SM-6 can be used against a variety of air and surface targets, with some existing variants even able to engage more novel hypersonic threats , as well as traditional ballistic missiles in their terminal stages of flight, TWZ previously reported. An enlarged version of the SM-6 is being developed that is expected to offer greater range and hypersonic peak speed. The destroyer USS John Paul Jones (DDG 53) launches a Standard Missile-6 (SM-6). (U.S. Navy) Loading a Mk 70 launcher with Tomahawk missiles would drastically increase the LCS’s capabilities, allowing the class to strike land and sea targets within an area extending roughly 1,000 miles in all directions, which would help hold targets in areas with substantial Chinese defenses. The Tomahawks can also loiter over a target and have their target changed mid-flight. The Savannah test-fire wasn’t the first time we’ve glimpsed such a setup aboard a LCS. TWZ previously reported on a photo taken during the 2022 Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise in Hawaii that showed the USS Tulsa (LCS-16) similarly equipped, although the Navy did not disclose anything about the loadout or whether Tulsa fired any missiles using the system during the exercise. The littoral combat ship USS Tulsa (LCS-16) at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii during the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise in 2022. (U.S. Navy) Del Toro did not mention what sort of sensors would accompany Mk 70 launchers on a LCS. But for SM-6 and Tomahawk, remote sensor and targeting data from external platforms — including those in the air, at sea, on land, and in space — that is datalinked to the ship would likely be the most feasible option considering the LCS's limited sensor suite. This concept of distributing missiles across more vessels and locales and decentralizing their fire control and targeting has long been of major interest to the Navy. But strapping on other sensors is a possibility too. For instance, ship spotters picked up what appeared to be a trailer-mounted AN/TPQ-53 radar on Savannah’s flight deck when it left San Diego for the test-fire last year. That radar is primarily designed to spot and track incoming rockets and artillery rounds, and then determine their points of launch so friendly forces can launch so-called counter-battery strikes, TWZ reported, and it also has demonstrated an ability to detect and track drones. TWZ previously laid out what else such a radar, also known as the Counterfire Target Acquisition Radar, would contribute, including the improved ability of Mk 70-equipped ships to spot and engage targets independently, regardless of a ship’s built-in capabilities. It offers an example of how systems could be lashed to the ship's deck to help expand its sensor capabilities for tailored mission sets. Del Toro also noted Wednesday that 'numerous' LCS are now equipped with the Naval Strike Missile (NSM), an anti-ship cruise missile that is very capable, but nowhere near as flexible as the SM-6 or as long-reaching as a Tomahawk. The Navy continues to push ahead with plans to place the NSM aboard its entire LCS fleet by Fiscal Year 2032, Inside Defense previously reported. Go here to read more about NSM aboard the LCS. The Naval Strike Missile (NSM). (U.S. Navy) But while the Mk 70 launcher and NSM give the LCS fleet some added firepower, there are tradeoffs, as TWZ has reported: 'With regard to the Navy’s LCSs, it is worth noting that using the rear flight deck as a place to mount a Mk 70-series launcher and other associated equipment eliminates their ability to launch and recover helicopters. The service has long touted the ability of the ships to carry MH-60R Sea Hawk helicopters, as well as MQ-8C Fire Scout drone helicopters, as key to helping the ships find and engage targets at extended ranges, defend against close-in threats like small boat swarms, and just provide increased situational awareness.' An airborne MH-60R Sea Hawk helicopter. (U.S. Navy) Such a tradeoff would be a massive one for the LCS as its flight deck and embarked aviation capabilities are highly prized and greatly expand the ship's flexibility and independence of operations. Giving up that capability for just four missiles per Mk70, presumably at least three systems can be carried, is a big concession. It is possible that Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles (RIM-162s) could be quad-packed into each cell like they are on Navy Mark 41 systems. This would offer the LCS 16 missiles per launcher, but those would be used for self defense and up to medium-range area air defense, that is if the LCS's sensors can support their employment. The data-link equipped RIM-162 Block II could be key to making that a reality. It would give the LCS a massive upgrade in air defense capabilities and survivability in higher-end threat environments. The Navy currently operates 25 LCS, and it has decommissioned seven ships since 2021, including some with less than five years of service, a move that the Navy framed as a way to save money for investing in more promising systems. Will Mk 70 help redeem the acquisition boondoggle colloquially referred to by some as the 'Little Crappy Ship,' even as questions remain about how quickly the system can be fielded and the LCS’s survivability in a full-blown war? Only time will tell.

Drones Over New Jersey Show Signs Of Coordination, Elude Helicopt...	Apparent drones spotted in the skies over New Jersey, some as big as six feet across, look to be operating in a coordinated manner not consistent with hobbyists, according to claims being made by state and local officials. They have also evaded attempts to detect and identify them definitively using helicopters and other sensors. Major questions remain about the reported sightings, which have occurred every day since November 18, as The War Zone was first to report on. The ongoing situation has become a national cause celebre that is skirting the line between hysteria and real national security concerns, as you can read about more in our past reporting here. The New Jersey State Police (NJSP) hosted briefings at its headquarters for mayors and state lawmakers about the drone sightings yesterday. Other state and federal officials were also present, according to attendees. The FBI is currently leading the investigation into the current situation, but is coordinating with other entities, including NJSP, the New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness (OHSP), and the U.S. Coast Guard. It is also known that the U.S. military, through U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM), has also been engaged on some level, but has not yet been asked to directly assist in responding to the sightings. First Sightings: Reported on 11/18, with sightings occurring every night since then, from dusk until 11 PM (6–7 hours),' New Jersey Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia wrote in a lengthy post on X about what was briefed. 'Frequency: Reports range from 4 to 180 sightings per night.' I just left the New Jersey State Police HQ following the briefing of New Jersey State Legislators relating to the unexplained drone sightings in New Jersey. Might I add - @GovMurphywas not present. My notes are organized following my take below on the situation.1. We know… pic.twitter.com/kPnFGd5g5u&mdash; Dawn Fantasia (@DawnFantasia_NJ) December 11, 2024 It is important to note here that reported sightings do not necessarily mean something mysterious was actually spotted. As The War Zone has previously highlighted, much, if not all of the imagery purporting to show suspected drones flying over New Jersey, such as the picture in the social media post below, is actually of airliners and other normal aircraft that crisscross the state on a daily basis. Large drones have been hovering in formation over northern New Jersey, officials say, leading to 'unnerved' residents wondering what's behind these bright, unidentified flying objects appearing almost every night in the sky. NBC News (@NBCNews) December 3, 2024 However, state and local authorities have spotted what they have assessed to be 'large drones (up to 6 ft in diameter),' according to Assemblywoman Fantasia. They appear to 'operate in a coordinated manner' and are 'not identified as hobbyist drones,' she also said in her post on X. Federal and state authorities have also categorically denied that the sightings over New Jersey have been of craft operated by government entities at any level, Michael Melham, Mayor of Belleville Township, said in a video he posted on Facebook about the 'mayors-only' briefing he had attended. Whether or not they might be carrying any particular payload is currently unknown, he added. 'They operate in a coordinated manner. The lights are usually on and they're blinking &#8230; but they do turn off at times, making it very difficult to detect. They appear to actually avoid detection by traditional methods,' according to Melham. 'So when our helicopter, our state police helicopter, has gotten close, lights go off, and they go away. Makes it very, very difficult. We do not know and make and model. We don't know anything else about them.' A picture Belleville Township Mayor Michael Melham shared on Facebook that he took during the briefing he attended at NJSP headquarters yesterday. Michael Melham/Facebook 'NJSP deployed helicopters &#8230; but could not detect drones, even with infrared cameras,' Assemblywoman Fantasia also wrote on X. 'Suspended helicopter flights to investigate drones over safety concerns.' 'We have by far the most robust equipment is what the State Police told us. The detection equipment is up, but not detecting,' Mayor Melham said in his video update without elaborating on the systems in question. 'We usually pick them up on local radar' he added. The exact mix of capabilities that authorities are currently using to provide initial detection, and whether they are following up on individual reported sightings from the public, as well as how assets like helicopters have been tasked out in response, remain unclear. Considering nearly all the videos we have seen from civilians on the ground show mundane aircraft, they are not going to find anything once they arrive based on such reports. Regardless, spotting and tracking small aerial objects using infrared video cameras on another flying platform can be challenging, especially for personnel who do not train to do so on a regular basis. This all recalls an incident The War Zone reported on in 2021 where what was described as a 'highly modified drone' flying over Tucson, Arizona eluded a U.S. Customs and Border Protection helicopter that was tracking it on their FLIR camera system. Who may be operating the apparent drones or what their intentions remain unknown, but 'one of the takeaways today was that these drones statewide are hovering and appearing to be surveilling New Jersey's critical infrastructure,' Melham added. 'It was told to us that they know where they're at, they know where they're hovering, how long they're hovering,' but 'we have no idea where they're taking off from [and] &#8230; no idea where they're landing.' The infrastructure in question includes the U.S. Army's Picatinny Arsenal, as well as reservoirs and nuclear power plants, according to Melham. He also mentioned the Trump National Golf Course at Bedminster. As The War Zone has previously reported, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) enacted separate Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs) expressly prohibiting unauthorized drone flights around Picatinny and Bedminster in November. It is worth noting again here that Iran made a veiled threat to launch a drone strike against Trump while golfing back in 2021 and the regime in Tehran stands accused of actively plotting assassination attempts against him since then. A graphic posted in January 2021 on what was then called Twitter through an account tied to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei implying a drone strike against Donald Trump while golfing. The account in question was subsequently banned. via Twitter/X 'Multiple low-altitude aircraft were observed in the vicinity of one of our vessels near Island Beach State Park, New Jersey,' the U.S. Coast Guard separately confirmed to The War Zone yesterday. 'While no immediate threats or disruptions to operations were identified, the Coast Guard is assisting the FBI and state agencies to understand the type, origin, and intent of these aircraft and address potential risks to safety and security.' Significant questions about what exactly is happening in the skies over New Jersey clearly remain. While Melham said the briefing he received was very transparent, he expressed concerns about the handling of the situation to date. Assemblywoman Fantasia and other attendees have made similar remarks. 'We learned that 'no credible threat' is kind of, almost legalese. In a legal sense, if there is a known threat that they are aware of and they know something is going to happen at a certain time with a certain object to a certain location, well that is deemed a credible threat,' Melham said. 'If they don't know what's going to happen, it's not necessarily a critical threat. It's called a potential threat. So they are saying there is a threat potential, but they were saying that there are no credible threats.' 'They keep doubling down on, ‘There’s no threat,’ but they can’t find them and track them,' New Jersey State Senator Doug Steinhardt told the New York Post after one of the NJSP briefings yesterday. 'When people are saying that there is no credible threat, I believe they are saying they don’t know if there is one. That’s concerning.' This underscores the at best muddled messaging from federal and other authorities about the sightings, which has already prompted criticism and frustration. The lack of definitive information, or at times any new information, has contributed to increasingly fever-pitched statements about the situation. Exactly what quality of information and data local authorities are receiving or can generate themselves is also questionable. As The War Zone's editor-in-chief Tyler Rogoway wrote X yesterday: 'The mainstream media has no clue what they are talking about on this issue, none, and most outlets largely don’t seem to care. Local officials are very poor sources in terms of quality info on this issue. This is not a dig on them at all, it’s just there is not an in-house knowledge base there that understands it, just facets of it, not anywhere near a whole picture. This is a very complex issue with many technological facets. You don’t just call in a ‘drone guy’ and get briefed. We have ran into this issue many times. The U.S. gov messaging on this has been so absurdly poor and frankly dangerous&#8230; but that isn’t all that surprising. This has been the way it has been for years, but at least the denials have finally evaporated.' Mailbox/DMs etc full of people asking why we are not reporting on the drone stuff considering we broke all this over many years. We are! But we have not been doing a play by play as the story has totally gone off the rails with reality and major news stories have developed…&mdash; Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) December 11, 2024 At the same time, as we have repeatedly stressed, the sightings above New Jersey do highlight real and still growing concerns about drone threats to the U.S. homeland, as well as to military forces overseas. The War Zone has been leading coverage of worrisome drone incursions for years now, including breaking the news about incidents at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia in December 2023, the Air Force's Plant 42 advanced aerospace development hub in California this past fall, and U.S. facilities in the United Kingdom last month. The U.S. military and the rest of the U.S. federal government continue to lag behind in responding to these threats, or even having coordinated ways to document and investigate sightings of what often blurs into the realm of what are now referred to as unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP). There continues to be considerable evidence that many purported UAPs are actually drones or balloons, and that foreign actors may be using those craft to surveil or otherwise harass military forces and facilities, as well as critical civilian targets, in and around the United States. 'We don't really want you to use 911. If you have a local non-emergency number for your local police department, please [use that] &#8230;,' Mayor Melham said in his video on Facebook. 'If you do call 911 &#8230; just know that we will then be redirecting that to the FBI. When we redirect that to the FBI, all it really is is a QR code. We upload a report and we never hear anything again. That's basically the way that they are logging these instances.' Whatever is being seen in the skies above New Jersey, the situation continues to be of great interest and importance within the context of very real potential threats posed by drones that are only growing and the need for better mechanisms to address them.

Northrop Grumman’s Mission Solutions Aim To Keep Fourth-Generatio...	Fourth-generation fighter aircraft continue to play critical roles in air forces around the world, even where operators are transitioning to more advanced fifth-generation platforms. The U.S. Air Force, for example, features more F-16s in its total force inventory than any other fighter aircraft type. The Viper’s future roadmap foresees it operating in an increasingly threatening battlespace and being tasked with tackling a multitude of complex mission sets. Faced with extended life-expectancy and a need to address current and emerging threats, fighters such as the F-16 are being heavily modernized in order to remain relevant, ensure their survivability, and to bridge the gap between what armed forces currently operate and aircraft types that they need for future warfare. 'Adversaries are advancing their capabilities at unprecedented rates,' says Jim Conroy, vice president, electronic warfare and targeting at Northrop Grumman. 'To maintain their operational relevance, the fourth- and fifth-generation fighter aircraft flown by the U.S. and international air forces need to consistently be updated with new capabilities over time.' A U.S. Air Force F-16C assigned to the 422nd Test and Evaluation Squadron. Jamie Hunter Northrop Grumman is continuously modernizing fourth-generation aircraft with advanced electronic warfare (EW), targeting and sensing capabilities for greater survivability, precision and resilience, while increasing interoperability across domains. They’ve developed, fielded, and iterated critical mission systems for the F-16 for more than five decades, and these upgrades have never been more relevant than they are today. Since the F-16’s inception, Northrop Grumman has been the sole radar provider for the F-16, and its electronic warfare systems have served for decades on the platform. 'F-16 operators rely on our deep-rooted experience to provide advanced capabilities that meet their future demands,' says Lindsay McEwen, vice president, combat sensors at Northrop Grumman. 'From mechanically-scanned (M-Scan) arrays to active electronically scanned arrays (AESA), and analog to digital EW systems, Northrop Grumman is no stranger to modernization, ensuring fleet sustainment and long-term operability for the F-16.' Spectrum dominance for the fourth-generation One key driver of modernization is the rapid growth in electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) warfare, where advanced electronic warfare and sensing capabilities are prerequisites for survivability and mission success. Northrop Grumman has addressed this need with their AN/ALQ-257 Integrated Viper Electronic Warfare Suite (IVEWS) and AN/APG-83 Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR). An image of a SABR during flight-testing. Northrop Grumman 'IVEWS was designed to give the F-16 capabilities on par with fifth-generation aircraft,' said Conroy. 'It provides both situational awareness and countermeasures, and its ultra-wideband architecture allows it to see and defeat more radio frequency [RF] threats.' 'SABR has been an integral part of F-16 modernization, enhancing performance and bringing agility to the platform with every variation,' says McEwen. 'SABR’s software-defined AESA technology requires fewer moving parts, providing reliability rates three-to-five times greater than traditional M-Scan radars. This translates to greater radar system availability and lower sustainment costs.' While each system is highly effective as a standalone capability, their designs are also fully interoperable, which means IVEWS is able to provide protection without interfering with SABR. For aircraft equipped with SABR, the addition of IVEWS allows for full lethality without compromising survivability. The AN/ALQ-257 Integrated Viper Electronic Warfare Suite, also known as IVEWS. Northrop Grumman Every mission begins with survivability 'With modern threats on the battlefield, it’s possible for a pilot to be in the weapons engagement zone and not be aware of it,' says Conroy. 'That is why it is so important for every platform to have robust electronic warfare protection against agile systems.' Recent operational assessment flight tests on two U.S. Air Force F-16s that have IVEWS permanently installed demonstrated the ability of IVEWS to detect such threats. During more than 50 flight hours, IVEWS performed exceptionally well against both airborne and ground-based threats in a demanding electromagnetic spectrum environment, Conroy added. Four F-16Cs seen flying during a training exercise. Jamie Hunter Critical for mission success, IVEWS provides a level of protection without interfering with the onboard AN/APG-83 SABR AESA. The two systems are digitally interoperable on a pulse-to-pulse basis, allowing for both IVEWS and SABR to operate simultaneously and at full capability during missions. In contrast, legacy systems used a blanking approach, which required one system to shut off briefly while the other operates – the electronic warfare system, for example, would be unable to detect threats while it is being blanked. Northrop Grumman has applied its expertise in ultra-wideband architectures to the other side of EMS operations – sensing via advanced AESA technology. Enhancing situational awareness to ensure air superiority In dense, fast-paced, air combat environments, where visibility is often drastically obscured, it’s nearly impossible to get a full picture of the landscape. A platform’s radar is the sole system that can pierce through the chaos. As the battlespace becomes more contested, modernizing fourth-generation fighters requires upgrading to the latest radar technology – AESA. SABR in production. Northrop Grumman 'Our industry-leading AESA technology brings SABR greater bandwidth to perform more accurately in hostile environments,' said McEwen. 'Its long-range detection, rapid scanning, and high-resolution mapping greatly enhances situational awareness, allowing warfighters to make faster and more accurate decisions.' Approximately 95 percent of SABR’s mode suite and hardware baseline design comes from Northrop Grumman’s highly successful fifth-generation AESA radars, including robust and proven electronic protection. This not only makes it a more sustainable and cost-effective platform, but the AESA software base enables interoperability with fifth-generation platforms, allowing real-time data sharing and collaboration. This is crucial in network-centric warfare where joint operations require a wider range of aircraft for mission success. Seeing farther with electro-optical/infrared systems To ensure pilots have necessary situational awareness and precise targeting capabilities throughout the spectrum, Northrop Grumman also provides the LITENING electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) targeting pod. LITENING has been in operation for 25 years with over 900 pods in service on 10 different aircraft types, now including the U.S. Navy F/A-18 Super Hornet. 'The latest variant of LITENING, known as Large Aperture [LA], has six high-definition sensors that allow the pilot to see targets and threats in color and in three infrared bands: mid-wave, short-wave and long-wave,' explains Conroy. 'The long-wave sensor will give the pod greatly enhanced air-to-air, passive targeting capabilities, and the best EO/IR situational awareness available to date.' LITENING LA provides fighters that are carrying the pod a capability which can be used to work in conjunction with the radar and other onboard sensors to better ascertain airborne threats at long distances. This means fighters carrying the pods are able to accurately identify and track even stealthy threats passively, making them better able to engage them with their weapons, at long range, without giving away their presence. A close view of the front end of a LITENING Large Aperture pod. Northrop Grumman Staying on track with jam-resistant navigation systems One threat pilots are likely to face in future conflicts is the degradation or jamming of GPS signals. Northrop Grumman’s LN-260M embedded global positioning/inertial navigation system, an upgraded version of the F-16’s current navigation system, is designed to enable aircrews to continue operations even when GPS is being jammed. 'The M-Code technology in LN-260M will give pilots a more secure, encrypted, and resilient, jam-resistant navigation signal,' says Conroy. 'This system independently knows its location without the need for GPS.' A Super Hornet carrying a LITENING pod. Northrop Grumman Maintaining fourth-generation relevance in the future fight Air forces worldwide will rely on the F-16 as a core component in combat operations into the foreseeable future. Ensuring these platforms can carry out their missions in concert with fifth- and future sixth-generation aircraft will require an ongoing commitment to maintaining the combat readiness of the fleet. By adding advanced systems that are affordable, small in size, low in weight, and efficient in power consumption (low-SWaP) and designed to leverage open architectures, fourth-generation aircraft are guaranteed to remain relevant over time. Northrop Grumman’s advanced mission solutions such as IVEWS, SABR, and LITENING are keeping the Viper and other fourth-generation aircraft secure, survivable, resilient and ready for precise operations in the complex conflict scenarios of the future, ensuring warfighters return home safely.

Ukraine’s SA-8 Gecko ‘FrankenSAM’ Adapted To Fire Air-To-Air Miss...	We have gotten our best look at a Ukrainian 9K33 Osa (SA-8 Gecko) mobile short-range air defense system (SHORADS) armed with the Soviet-era R-73 (AA-11 Archer) infrared-guided air-to-air missile. While other such systems have typically integrated Western missile armament on existing Ukrainian ground-based air defense systems — known as ‘FrankenSAMs’ — this one is notable for being a domestic initiative combining a Soviet-era SHORADS vehicle with Soviet-era air-to-air missiles. Close-up of an R-73 missile loaded on an Osa-AKM SHORADS vehicle. Come Back Alive Photos of the upgraded Cold War-era Osa were published by Come Back Alive, a Ukrainian foundation that provides support to Ukrainian Armed Forces service members, including purchasing arms and equipment and providing additional training. The photos show an Osa armed with a single R-73 missile mounted on a rail on the right-hand side of its existing missile/radar turret. While there’s capacity for another missile to be fitted on the left-hand side, this isn’t loaded in these views. In its original form, the Osa-AKM version operated by Ukraine carries six 9M33 series missiles in box-type containers, three on each side of the turret. Earlier versions of the Osa carried four missiles. Ukrainian 9K33 Osa-AKM systems on parade in Kyiv, before the full-scale Russian invasion. Віталій/Wikimedia Commons Otherwise, the upgraded Oka retains the usual fully amphibious six-wheeled BAZ-5937 transport vehicle chassis. Mounted on this, the turret of the upgraded Osa appears to have the same H-band elliptical surveillance antenna (shown in the folded position) and the J-band engagement antenna mounted at the front, which is flanked by a smaller missile tracking radar on each side. This is not the first time we’ve seen the upgraded Osa with R-73 missiles, with a previous, lower-quality photo emerging in the spring of this year, this time with two missiles loaded. At the time, it was reported that the modification involved adding the APU-73 missile rail (the usual interface between the R-73 and an aircraft pylon) and unspecified 'additional equipment.' Picture of a OSA Short Range Air Defence System using what looks to be R-73 missiles (Thanks to those here helping me ID it).A cropped version was originally posted back on 12/11/2023 ( pic.twitter.com/AaoPYwWspQ&mdash; Jeff2146 (@Jeff21461) May 18, 2024 The result was claimed to marginally increase the range of the SHORADS, compared with its original missile armament. The Osa-AKM, or SA-8B Gecko Mod-1, as used by Ukraine, originally was armed with 9M33M3 missiles that have a maximum range of 9.3 miles and a maximum altitude of up to 40,000 feet. The R-73, in air-launched form, has a maximum range of 18.6 miles against a head-on target of 8.7 miles against a tail-on target. A ground-launched application would have reduced range since the missile wouldn’t benefit from the speed and altitude parameters of the launch aircraft. In this case, it’s perhaps more relevant to look at the seeker range of the R-73, which would remain broadly the same for ground launch: 6.2-7.5 miles. While these figures seem to conflict with the claim that the surface-launched R-73 offers improved range over the original missile, it should be noted that the published performance figures for the 9M33M3 are very much under ideal conditions and in real-life engagements its range would be significantly less.

Photo by Libkos/Getty Images LIBKOS The program was said to be a response to the dwindling stocks of the original 9M33 series missiles for the Osa, which have been greatly depleted, especially in dealing with low-level Russian drones and cruise missiles. The Osa system is also used to deal with low-level fixed-wing and helicopter threats over the battlefield. On the other hand, R-73 missile rounds exist in much greater numbers, aided by the fact that important parts of the weapon — notably its infrared seeker — were built in Ukraine. As the standard close-range Soviet air-to-air missile, it was also issued to air force units in huge numbers. Today, it remains part of the standard armament for Ukrainian Air Force MiG-29 Fulcrum and Su-27 Flanker fighters. A schematic diagram of the R-73 missile. Public Domain According to the latest information published by Come Back Alive, the foundation invested over 14 million hryvnias (around $336 million) in the Osa upgrade project. Although it doesn’t reveal how many of the systems were upgraded, it notes that Osa regiments within the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine have received the upgraded systems. Adding to the flexibility of the system, the same launcher vehicle can be armed with R-73s or 9M33M3s, presumably also being configured with a mix of missiles if required. A containerized 9M33M3s missile for an Osa-AKM system. Vitaly V. Kuzmin/Wikimedia Commons In a major advantage over the 9M33 series, the R-73 uses infrared guidance, meaning it’s a ‘fire and forget’ missile. Once launched, the vehicle can move away from the firing position. Using the older missile, the vehicle needs to keep tracking the target and the missile, as well as sending guidance commands to the missile. The nose of an R-73 missile arming an upgraded Osa-AKM. The Mayak-80 infrared seeker was designed and manufactured by the Arsenal factory in Kyiv. Come Back Alive Also, as TWZ has discussed in previous coverage of the missile, the R-73 is a high-off-boresight (HOBS) weapon, with a seeker that can articulate in any direction much farther than a traditional heat-seeking air-to-air missile with a fixed non-HOBS seeker that stares directly forward. Aided by a helmet-mounted sight, the Archer can be launched in air-to-air engagements against targets with off-boresight angles of +/-75 degrees. This gives the R-73 the potential to be a particularly potent, albeit improvised threat for locking onto and engaging dynamic targets with minimal assisting sensors when used in a surface-launched form. Clearly, Ukraine has also developed a way of using this HOBS capability remotely to ensure this weapon is effective at all.

The Yemen-based Houthi militants, in particular, have adapted R-73s for surface launch against aircraft targets, and used them in combat, as you can read about here. While there are similarities with the FrankenSAM program, the fact that the upgraded Osa doesn’t require Western missiles — or other Western technical expertise — means that it can be undertaken entirely domestically. An R-73 air-to-air missile on display. Black bands on the weapon indicate an inert round. Vitaly V. Kuzmin/Wikimdia Commons While it doesn’t rely on continued deliveries of Western missiles, it’s conceivable that the Osa platform could also be configured to fire Western AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. These are fairly similar to the R-73, with the same infrared guidance principle. Examples of the Sidewinder have already been donated to Ukraine by its Western allies, for use in a FrankenSAM solution, although it’s still not clear what platform they have been integrated on. In the past, TWZ noted that the AIM-9 could lend itself to arming an upgraded Osa-based FrankenSAM. There is something of a precedent for this, with the Polish defense contractor PGZ having previously pitched a broadly similar Osa conversion with the European IRIS-T missile as its effector. Meanwhile, the first FrankenSAM system to be seen in detail in official imagery comprises a Soviet-era Buk (SA-11 Gadfly) mobile surface-to-air missile system armed with radar-guided RIM-7 Sea Sparrow missiles. However, the similar AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missile has also been provided to Ukraine and is also understood to be employed in one or more FrankenSAM versions. One of the first official photos of a so-called ‘FrankenSAM.’ It shows a tracked self-propelled Buk-M1 system which is said to have been adapted to fire the RIM-7 Sea Sparrow, a missile that previously provided point defense for numerous NATO and allied warships. Ukraine’s Operational Command East There is also understood to be a longer-range FrankenSAM that combines U.S.-designed Patriot surface-to-air missiles and their launchers with elements from existing Ukrainian air defense systems, which might include radars from the country’s S-300P (SA-10 Grumble) systems. Outside of the FrankenSAM program, it’s worth noting that Ukraine’s stocks of R-73s have also been exploited for surface launch from uncrewed surface vessels (USVs), better known as drone boats. Ukrainian USVs operating in the Black Sea have been seen armed with R-73s, to provide the USVs with protection against the Russian helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft that are increasingly being used to counter them, as well as to offer an offensive anti-air capability in the same theater. In May of this year, videos released by the Russian Ministry of Defense showed a Ukrainian USV armed with an R-73 coming under attack from a Russian Navy Ka-29 Helix-B assault helicopter. The USV performed some hard maneuvers to try and escape the Ka-29 but was eventually destroyed, apparently by gunfire.

However, more could have been lost because Oryx only tabulates losses for which it has visual confirmation.

Come Back Alive The camouflage scheme on this Ukrainian Osa-AKM suggests it might be one of those donated from Polish stocks. Come Back Alive Regardless, Ukraine clearly has enough surviving systems to make it worthwhile launching a multi-million-dollar upgrade initiative. Despite its age, the basic Osa remains effective and, within NATO, is in use with Bulgaria, Greece, Poland, and Romania. As we have noted in the past, any of these nations could potentially be willing to give up their Osa systems, especially if inventories were backfilled with more modern SHORADS systems. For now, the upgraded Osa will be a very welcome boost for the Ukrainian air defenses, with the ground-based air defense element, in particular, having been very heavily worked, especially in the face of large-scale Russian drone attacks that have struck across the country in recent months.

Plans For New Hardened Aircraft Shelters Notably Absent From New ...	Any plans the Air Force might have for new hardened aircraft shelters or other physical defenses at bases are prominently absent from a new infrastructure modernization strategy. This is despite acknowledgments that the service's facilities 'can no longer be considered a sanctuary' and that those facilities need to be better prepared to support operations 'even while under attack.' All of this comes amid a major debate that extends well beyond the Air Force about how best to defend key U.S. military infrastructure, especially from growing drone and missile threats, and with a particular eye toward a potential high-end fight with China. The Department of the Air Force (DAF; which also includes the U.S. Space Force) unveiled what is formally called the Installation Infrastructure Action Plan (I2AP) yesterday. I2AP puts heavy emphasis on modernizing and right-sizing base infrastructure across the United States and abroad, as well as improving installation resiliency against hostile attacks and natural disasters, particularly when it comes to their electrical power requirements. A picture of a new solar power array at Joint Base Pearl Harbor Hickam in Hawaii included with the I2AP rollout to underscore work already being done to improve power grid resiliency at Air Force bases. Photo courtesy of HNUEnergy/Joseph Cannon 'DAF installations can no longer be considered a sanctuary. To ensure competitiveness in a high-end conflict, DAF installations must be able to deliver combat power with enough speed and intensity to be decisive, even while under attack,' an introduction to I2AP says. 'From hypersonic technology to unmanned aerial systems to advanced cyber capabilities, our installations must meet these new challenges and effectively generate combat power.' 'Resilient installation infrastructure possesses the capability to sustain combat power projection by protecting against, responding to, and recovering from deliberate, accidental, or natural events that impede all-domain operations,' the new installation plan also says. 'They require an infrastructure foundation with near immediate ‘ability to recover’ timeframes and ensure that critical missions are capable of being carried out, despite facing threats or adversities.' 'In this current environment, the ability of our installations to be effective and project power is going to be the margin of victory in Great Power Competition. And we had better be ready,' Dr. Ravi Chaudhary, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Energy, Installations, and Environment, also said during a virtual talk yesterday on the I2AP rollout that the Air & Space Forces Association hosted. Great Power Competition is the term of art the U.S. military has used in recent years to refer to newly mounting national security challenges posed by near-peer (and even potentially peer) adversaries, particularly China. 'You take a look across our inventory, and you're like, well, there's a lot of concrete out there &#8230; Concrete scares our adversaries just as much as fifth-gen fighters [like the F-22 and F-35], because the ability to mobilize and the ability to move a force from point A to point B is going to require concrete,' Chaudhary added. 'And so when you look at what we're doing in Indo-Pacific &#8230; bringing all-new airfields like Tinian, couple other locations, and robusting places like JBER [Joint Base Elmendorf–Richardson], places like Eielson [Air Force Base], that's exactly what we need to do.' A satellite image taken on June 6, 2022, showing the beginnings of construction to expand Air Force infrastructure at Tinian International Airport. PHOTO © 2022 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION JBER and Eielson are both in Alaska. Tinian is a U.S. territory in the western Pacific that is part of the larger Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). The War Zone has reported in the past on efforts to expand air base infrastructure at these locations. Work on Tinian is explicitly intended to provide critical additional capacity to project airpower in the event that the massive and highly strategic Andersen Air Force Base on the neighboring island of Guam is put out of action for any reason. All of this makes the absence of any explicit mention of plans for new hardened infrastructure or other defensive capabilities more pronounced. As already noted, there is a major debate ongoing about the value of physical hardening as part of future base defense plans, which The War Zone has previously explored in detail. The Air Force has signaled some support for more hardened aircraft shelters and otherwise 'robusting' infrastructure as Dr. Chaudhary put it yesterday. At the same time, the service has also called into question the value of major investments in physical defenses. 'We are looking at things … [that] increase the survivability of the bases from which we operate,' Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin said at an event the American Enterprise Institute hosted back in October, according to Air & Space Forces Magazine. 'And then in the midst of a conflict, how we get the right equipment to the right place at the right time is not only a matter of protecting it with hardened shelters and maybe camouflage, concealment, and deception, but it’s also connectivity, to have that situational awareness.' 'There's two classic schools of thought for resiliency. One is armor and harden the heck out of things. And the other is go with diversity and proliferation,' Tim Grayson, Special Assistant to Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall, explained during a talk that the Air & Space Forces Association’s Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies hosted in July. 'And it's really the latter, you know, because what ends up happening is you can spend so much time and money and effort on hardening things that you start degrading your own capabilities. So without being able to go into the specifics, I think we've made huge strides of hitting resiliency, through tougher diversity and mass and quantity.' 'I’m not a big fan of hardening infrastructure,' Air Force Gen. Kenneth Wilsbach, then head of Pacific Air Forces, the service's, also said at a roundtable at the 2023 Air & Space Forces Association symposium. 'The reason is because of the advent of precision-guided weapons… you saw what we did to the Iraqi Air Force and their hardened aircraft shelters. They’re not so hard when you put a 2,000-pound bomb right through the roof.' Wilsbach is now head of Air Combat Command (ACC). A picture from a ceremony in 2020 marking the completion of construction of new hardened aircraft shelters at Kunsan Air Base in South Korea, where elements of the U.S. Air Force are forward-deployed. USAF Congress has notably pushed back on these positions, including in an open letter from 13 Republican lawmakers earlier this year that warned that 'in recent war games [conducted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank] simulating a conflict with China over Taiwan, 90 percent of U.S. aircraft losses occurred on the ground, rather than from air combat.' That missive did also acknowledge that 'constructing hardened shelters for all our air assets may not be economically feasible or tactically sensible.' The Air Force is also very actively invested in concepts of operations known collectively as Agile Combat Employment (ACE). ACE is centered on reducing vulnerability and increasing flexibility through the ability to deploy in irregular and unpredictable manners to a growing number of bases globally. New and improved Tactics, techniques, and procedures to camouflage those movements and otherwise deceive enemies are also part of the equation. It is important to stress that hardened shelters and other physical infrastructure are not answers by themselves to the multi-faceted threat ecosystem facing the Air Force. For the Department of the Air Force, broader base defense issues are also tied up in the 1948 Key West Agreement, which firmly delineated the service's roles and missions from those of the U.S. Army that it had split off from. Per that deal, the Army is in charge of defending Air Force bases at home and abroad from aerial threats. 'We know that, doctrinally, the Army has taken responsibility since the 1940s for air base air defense. We may have some questions on that,' Dr. Chaudhary said yesterday. 'We may want to enter in a broader discussion on what that's going to look like going forward, because right now, the threats are so localized and so tactical that we may want to have a broader discussion &#8230; and take on some of those mission sets going forward.'

US Army A THAAD launcher, at left, along with a Transportable Tactical Command Communications (T2C2) node, at right, among other equipment, emplaced at Rota International Airport on Rota Island during a test in 2022. US Army 'Frankly, I would be comfortable with the Department of the Air Force taking on the total defense/local defense of air bases as an organic mission, if the needed resources – human and financial, etc – were made available,' Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall had also said during a keynote speech at the Airlift/Tanker Association’s (ATA) annual symposium in November. As the I2AP strategy notes, all of this comes amid steadily expanding threats to bases across the U.S. military, at home and overseas, as well as to critical civilian infrastructure, especially from drones and missiles. Drones have become a particular hot-button issue amid a rash of worrisome and still-unexplained incidents, including incursions over Langley Air Force Base in Virginia last year and more recently multiple U.S. facilities in the United Kingdom, as well as sightings in the skies above New Jersey. The War Zone, which was the first to report on all of these events, has repeatedly pointed out over the years that the dangers posed by uncrewed aerial systems are hardly new and are still growing, and that the barrier to entry is low. The Pentagon just recently announced a new department-wide counter-drone strategy, which acknowledges these threats, but also underscores the U.S. military's continued lag in addressing them, which you can read more about here. It's worth noting here that authorities at Langley, as well as Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina, have already been looking into the possibility of erecting anti-drone nets or other passive defenses to help protect against uncrewed aerial threats. A graphic offering general details about sunshade-type shelters at Langley Air Force Base that might now be in line to receive anti-drone nets. USAF New and improved cruise and ballistic missiles, as well as novel hypersonic weapons, also present particular concerns for U.S. military bases globally. These are threats not limited to Great Power Competition, with smaller nation-states and even non-state actors increasingly fielding more capable stand-off missiles. 'I think we're going to start thinking more broadly about what contested homeland operations look like, and so look to something coming out,' Dr. Chaudhary did also say yesterday toward the end of his talk. 'Our Secretary [Kendall] has made a few statements on that, that we may be open to taking that mission [base defense] on in the future. So we're excited about this. We're going to talk about it, but, so, to come in the future.' So, more may be coming soon from the Air Force about its plans for physical hardening of bases and/or other defensive measures.

Coast Guard Ship Stalked By Unidentified Aircraft, Iran Drone Mot...	The Pentagon on Wednesday shot down a statement by a New Jersey Congressman that there is an 'Iranian mothership off the coast of the United States launching&#8230; drone incursions.' The claim by U.S. Rep. Jeff Van Drew came as more and more people are seeing things in the sky they believe to be drones, blurring the line between hysteria and real national security concerns. The War Zone was the first to report about the New Jersey sightings that have since reached a fever pitch in the national consciousness. At the same time, the U.S. Coast Guard has confirmed an incident with one of their ships off New Jersey that was followed by unidentified aircraft. 'Iran Launched a Mothership' Rep. Jeff Van Drew says very high sources told him Iran placed a ship in the Atlantic Ocean a month ago and appear to be responsible for the drone incursions over New Jersey.'This is a clear and present danger to the United States.' pic.twitter.com/RqXPDNvqwO&mdash; UAP James (@UAPJames) December 11, 2024 'There is not any truth to that,' Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters, including from The War Zone, Wednesday afternoon about Drew's claim, made during a hearing Wednesday morning on the FAA's budget. 'There is no Iranian ship off the coast of the United States, no so-called mothership launching drones off the coast of the United States.' I asked Pentagon Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh about Cong Jeff Van Drew’s assertion that the drones over NJ are coming from an Iranian mothership that he says left Tehran a month ago and that the drones are being launched from this mothership off the East Coast of the U.S.… Jennifer Griffin (@JenGriffinFNC) December 11, 2024 U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) told us it has 'no evidence or credible intelligence that any ship from either Iran or other known adversary is involved in any way with the recent reports of drone activity near the New York or New Jersey area.' The command was recently given the authority to synchronize the U.S. military's response to drone incursions. You can read more about the Pentagon's new counter-drone policies unveiled last week in our deep dive here. While officials dismissed the mother ship claim, the Coast Guard on Wednesday confirmed that 'multiple low-altitude aircraft were observed in the vicinity of one of our vessels near Island Beach State Park, New Jersey,' LT Luke Pinneo said in a statement. 'While no immediate threats or disruptions to operations were identified, the Coast Guard is assisting the FBI and state agencies to understand the type, origin, and intent of these aircraft and address potential risks to safety and security. We take any and all aircraft activity near federal assets seriously and urge the public to report any suspicious activity to local authorities.' The Coast Guard statement came in response to our questions about claims made by U.S. Rep. Chris Smith on Tuesday that a 47-foot Coast Guard ship 'was followed by between 12 and 30 of these drones as they went through the water — followed, right behind them.' Actual Jersey Shore:A Commanding Officer in New Jersey Coast Guard told Rep. Chris Smith his 47-foot ship 'was followed by between 12 and 30 of these drones as they went through the water — followed, right behind them,' Smith told FBI, DOJ & CBP officials today. pic.twitter.com/avbizOtblL&mdash; Matt Laslo (@MattLaslo) December 10, 2024 That the Coast Guard quickly confirmed unidentified aircraft flew over one of its vessels is in stark contrast to how the Navy handled drone flights over its warships off the southern California coastline. As we were the first to report from a response to our federal Freedom of Information Act query, the mysterious swarming of U.S. Navy ships off the Southern California occurred over multiple days. You can read more about that in our reporting from the time here. Though it denied the Iranian mothership claim, NORTHCOM is taking reports about drones flying over New Jersey seriously. 'We are aware and monitoring the reports of unauthorized drone flights in the vicinity of military installations in New Jersey to include Picatinny Arsenal and Naval Weapons Station Earle,' the command said. It deferred comment about what actions are being taken in response to those installations. 'U.S. Northern Command conducted a deliberate analysis of the events, in consultation with other military organizations and interagency partners, and at this time we have not been requested to assist with these events,' NORTHCOM explained. 'If these incidents require additional DoD assistance, the Secretary of the Military Department or relevant DoD component head concerned can coordinate with USNORTHCOM for an enhanced or increased response. USNORTHCOM, in conjunction with our interagency partners, will continue to assess further information and is prepared to respond when asked or should the situation escalate to threaten any DoD installations.' #USNORTHCOM Statement regarding reports of drone activity in New Jersey.

On Dec. 3 spokesman Tim Rider told us that 'Picatinny Arsenal Police Department did receive an unconfirmed report on Monday evening. Because it is an active investigation, please direct any further queries on the topic to the FBI.' U.S. Army photo Naval Weapons Station Earle confirmed to us today that there was 'at least one instance of an unidentified drone entering the airspace above Naval Weapons Station Earle,' facility spokesman William Addison told us. He declined to specify when the incursion happened, what type of drones, or how the base responded. The facility, located in Colts Neck, New Jersey about 20 miles south of New York City, 'is aware of the reports of increased drone activity in New Jersey and Monmouth County and we are actively monitoring the situation,' Addison added. 'We have received reports from our neighboring communities and law enforcement partners regarding drone activity near the installation.' The FBI, which is leading the investigation into the drone sightings, told us it had no updates on Wednesday In addition to the two military installations, authorities say spottings of drones above critical infrastructure including reservoirs, electrical transmission lines, rail stations and police departments have occurred. The issue of drone incursions has become so concerning that Congress on Tuesday held a hearing on the matter. Robert Wheeler Jr., assistant director of the Critical Incident Response Group for the FBI, testified that the bureau has few details about the incursions, which began on Nov. 18 over Picatinny and the surrounding area and have since spread all over New Jersey. 'The bureau is actively investigating the unexplained sighting of drone activity over that part of New Jersey, including proximity to sensitive sites and areas of concern,' Wheeler explained. 'We do not attribute that to an individual or group yet. I don't have an answer of who's responsible, one or more people that are responsible, but we're actively investigating.'

Phil Murphy told reporters that he has spoken with White House officials about the ‘very sophisticated’ drones over New Jersey. 'The minute you get eyes on them, they go dark… This is something we’re taking deadly seriously.' While speaking at an unrelated bill signing event in Princeton, Murphy noted there were 49 reports of drones on Sunday, mostly in Hunterdon County, according to The Associated Press. Murphy explained that those numbers 'included possible sightings and potentially the same drone being reported more than once.' 'This is something we’re taking deadly seriously. I don’t blame people for being frustrated,' Murphy said.

Responding to the spate of drone incursions, the FAA enacted two Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs) prohibiting drone flights without prior permission over Picatinny Arsenal and the Trump National Golf Course Bedminster without permission. The Picatinny TFR went into effect Nov. 25 and ends Dec. 26 while the one over Trump National was initiated Nov. 22 and slated to end Dec. 6, but was subsequently extended to Dec. 20 Officials at Trump National could not be reached for comment on Tuesday and have yet to respond to our first query when we asked about possible drone incursions over or near the facility back on Nov. 20. Drones can be operated over those locations in support of national defense, homeland security, law enforcement, firefighting, search and rescue or natural disaster response, as well as event operations and approved commercial flights, according to the TFR. Any drones violating the restriction are subject to 'the interference, disruption, seizing, damaging or destruction of the unmanned [aircraft]' by the Defense Department, Department of Homeland Security or the Department of Justice,' the TFRs note. Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFR) over Picatinny Arsenal. (FAA) Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFR) over Trump National Golf Course Bedminster. (FAA) In a statement, the FAA said last week it had 'received reports of drone activity near Morris County, New Jersey, on Monday, Nov. 18. At the request of federal security partners, the FAA published two Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs) prohibiting drone flights' over the base and golf course. It is unclear if any drones flew over the Trump golf course. 'We look into all reports of unauthorized drone operations and investigate when appropriate,' the statement continued. 'Drone operators who conduct unsafe operations that endanger other aircraft or people on the ground could face fines up to $75,000. In addition, we can suspend or revoke drone operators’ pilot certificates.' Trump has been threatened with drone attacks before. Nearly four years ago, Iran made a veiled threat of a drone strike on Trump with an image posted on social media. It depicted what appeared to be the shadow of one of Iran’s flying wing-type unmanned aircraft — designs that are supposedly derived, at least in its shape, from a captured U.S. RQ-170 stealth drone — some of which are capable of dropping small munitions, looming over a figure that seems clearly intended to represent Trump taking a swing on a golf course. That tweet, by ran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was in retaliation for the death of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani ordered by Trump. It led to his account being banned. You can see an image from the tweet below. This image in this tweet caused Twitter to ban the account of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in 2021. (Twitter sceen cap) www.twz.com Large drones 'have been hovering in formation over northern New Jersey, officials said last week, leading to 'unnerved' residents wondering what's behind these bright, unidentified flying objects appearing almost every night in the sky,' NBC News reported. In addition to the FBI, the Morris County Sheriff's Department is also actively investigating the aerial phenomenon, 'which has been an annoyance but not yet any kind of safety threat, authorities said,' according to the network. The image provided by a witness claiming to be one of those drones was in reality a commercial airliner, as you can see below. This has been the case constantly in reporting across the mainstream media space. Large drones have been hovering in formation over northern New Jersey, officials say, leading to 'unnerved' residents wondering what's behind these bright, unidentified flying objects appearing almost every night in the sky. NBC News (@NBCNews) December 3, 2024 Though the concern about drones flying over military installations and other sensitive locations is legitimate, nearly all of the videos and imagery TWZ has reviewed are of private and commercial aircraft. There is also growing speculation that many of these objects are UFOs, or what the Pentagon now refers to as unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs). However, a spokesperson for the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), the Pentagon office that handles these matters, told us that it 'received no reports of UAP in conjunction with recent drone flights or incursions in the New Jersey area.' There are a number of reasons why sightings are being misidentified. 'Nearly every video I have seen has pointed to mass hysteria not a drone invasion of massive scale, with airliners, private jets, and helicopters being portrayed as mysterious objects,' TWZ editor-in-chief explained on Twitter. 'These videos are peddled for engagement by a growing number of online accounts. This is very unfortunate, because there does seem to be something going on here, but zero critical thought, even on a most basic level of the 'evidence' only fuels rumors and fear. It also clogs the channels for relevant evidence to break through. This is true on a public consumption and governmental/investigative level. It also puts aircraft in danger.' Mailbox/DMs etc full of people asking why we are not reporting on the drone stuff considering we broke all this over many years. We are! But we have not been doing a play by play as the story has totally gone off the rails with reality and major news stories have developed…&mdash; Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) December 11, 2024 During Wednesday's press briefing, we asked Singh to tell us how the Pentagon views the legitimacy of many of these drone claims. 'The initial assessments are that these are drones, and potentially could be small airplanes. It could be a number of things that people are seeing and reporting. That's, you know, for the investigation to uncover, and so I can't speak to that more in terms of a frenzy.' 'I think it's completely right that people report these sightings and that there is an investigation into what they are seeing,' she added. 'But I think what's also important to remember is that at no time were our military institute installations, or are people ever under any threat, and if they were, of course, the base commanders have the ability to engage these drones if they do pose a threat.' There are several impediments, however, to defending against drones. Given current rules and regulations, the U.S. military isn’t currently interested in fielding kinetic and directed energy capabilities, such as laser and high-power microwave weapons, surface-to-air interceptors, and gun systems, for defending domestic bases and other critical infrastructure from rapidly growing and evolving drone threats. Instead, the focus is on systems that provide drone detection, as well as electronic warfare and cyber warfare, and other ‘soft-kill’ options, at least for the time being. You can read more about in our deep dive here. With so many agencies involved in investigating the drone incursions, the government's message has been muddled at a best. That's added to the confusion. When the drones first appeared over Picatinny, the military offered public comments. Then the FBI came in and provided no details. Elected officials began to fill the void, adding to the growing alarm to the point where Congress had to intervene. Now the Pentagon is involved. As TWZ's editor discussed in his X post earlier today, this has led to a major hysteria: 'The mainstream media has no clue what they are talking about on this issue, none, and most outlets largely don't seem to care. Local officials are very poor sources in terms of quality info on this issue. This is not a dig on them at all, it's just there is not an in-house knowledge base there that understands it, just facets of it, not anywhere near a whole picture. This is a very complex issue with many technological facets. You don't just call in a 'drone guy' and get briefed. We have ran into this issue many times. The U.S. gov messaging on this has been so absurdly poor and frankly dangerous, there is a story there we are working on, but that isn't all that surprising. This has been the way it has been for years, but at least the denials have finally evaporated&#8230;' 'But beware of the prevailing narrative and especially what you see portrayed on social media, this is now a hype train and everyone is jumping on, and many are doing so for the wrong reasons. I applaud those that are doing the opposite&#8230;' Mailbox/DMs etc full of people asking why we are not reporting on the drone stuff considering we broke all this over many years. We are! But we have not been doing a play by play as the story has totally gone off the rails with reality and major news stories have developed…&mdash; Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) December 11, 2024 The growing hysteria over this issue clouds the fact that real drones pose a significant national security threat. While the Pentagon has repeatedly claimed that there is no indication of a foreign connection to the drone incursions, a Chinese national was arrested earlier this week for flying a drone over Vandenberg Space Force Base. Yinpiao Zhou, 39, is charged with failure to register an aircraft not providing transportation and violation of national defense airspace, according to the Justice Department. Zhou was arrested on Dec. 10 at San Francisco International Airport before boarding a China-bound flight and is expected to make his initial appearance tomorrow in United States District Court in San Francisco. On Nov. 30, 'drone detection systems at Vandenberg Space Force Base in Santa Barbara County detected a drone flying over the base,' the Justice Department release stated. 'The drone systems detected that the drone flew for nearly one hour, traveled to an altitude of almost one mile above ground level, and originated from Ocean Park, a public area next to the base. Base security personnel went to the park, spoke to Zhou and another person accompanying him, and learned that Zhou had a drone concealed in his jacket – the same one that flew over the base.' After obtaining a warrant to search his drone, agents found 'several photographs of Vandenberg Space Force Base taken from an aerial viewpoint. A search of Zhou’s cellphone showed Zhou conducted a Google search approximately one month earlier for the phrase 'Vandenberg Space Force Base Drone Rules' and messaged with another person about hacking his drone to allow it to fly higher than it could otherwise.' Vandenberg is a key military installation, where ICBM and missile defense tests, as well as many other space launch activities occur, among other missions.

TWZ has been on the leading edge of covering this topic for years and has broken multiple stories now about drone incursions over key U.S. bases and training ranges, as well as uncrewed aerial systems harassing American forces off the coasts of the United States and making worrisome overflights of important non-military sites. A spate of drone incursions over Langley Air Force Base in Virginia in December 2023, which TWZ was the first report on, has now become a particular national cause celebre. The interest in these incursions is growing every day and statements like the one about the Iranian mothership drive the story to new heights, regardless of the accuracy. We will continue to cover these issues and provide the truth, in both fact and context, as best we can.

Inside T-7 Red Hawk Test Operations At Edwards AFB	The U.S. Air Force’s new advanced jet trainer aircraft, the Boeing T-7A Red Hawk, is deeply engaged in an accelerating and expanding flight test program at Edwards Air Force Base in California. The USAF’s need for the Red Hawk is acute, with aged T-38 Talons bearing a heavy pilot training burden as Air Education And Training Command (AETC) struggles to meet pilot output targets. The T-7 is designed to improve aircraft availability and it incorporates technology meant to accelerate training. 'The T-7A is a generational change over the T-38 that’s going to open up a lot of options for AETC,' says Lt. Col. Jonathan 'Gremlin' Aronoff, the T-7A Integrated Test Force director. A team of Air Force and Boeing pilots and engineers are working with the new trainer to generate sufficient data and confidence to endorse that the aircraft is ready for students and instructors to fly and that the Red Hawk meets contractual requirements that would green-light Boeing to commence low-rate initial production. One of the T-7A Production Relevant Jets, known as BTX-1, lands at Edwards AFB after a test flight. Jamie Hunter Delays in the T-7 program have compounded USAF pilot training struggles, as detailed in May 2023 by Andrew Hunter, the assistant secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. 'Due to issues discovered in the early development and test phase of the program, the Air Force is delaying its Milestone C decision to initiate the buy of T-7A production aircraft. This will shift the T-7A program’s initial operational capability [IOC] into the Spring of 2027. We are pursuing risk reduction activities to mitigate some of these schedule challenges,' Hunter said in 2023. However, significant progress is being made, with Red Hawks now flying with the Integrated Test Force at Edwards AFB, which is breeding confidence that the program is making good progress. 'Everyone here is eager for the test work so we can get the airplane to AETC as fast as possible. They need the T-7A and we want to give it to them as quickly and as safely as we can,' adds Aronoff. 'We definitely don’t have any excessive pressure on us, it’s very much about working methodically to get the Air Force something it needs, and everyone's being incredibly respectful of how we do that.' T-7A Red Hawk origin The Boeing T-7A advanced jet trainer was selected in 2018 to replace the USAF’s geriatric T-38C Talons, but the Red Hawk is already three years behind its original schedule, and is now planned to enter service in 2027. The original timeline called for Boeing to start delivering the first T-7As to the USAF at Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph, Texas, from 2023 to commence initial instructor pilot training, ahead of IOC in 2024, which is defined as being a 'fully fitted-out squadron of aircraft and training devices.' Boeing was awarded a $9.2-billion contract by the USAF in September 2018 to supply 351 T-7As and 46 associated ground-based training simulators when it won the T-X trainer competition. Initial flight-test work was conducted out of Boeing’s St. Louis, Missouri, facility using a pair of 'Production Relevant Jets,' or PRJs, that Boeing built for the T-X competition phase. Following the contract award, Boeing started T-7A production at St. Louis with a static test article (STA) and the first of five engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) aircraft. Boeing said in early 2021 that the STA would be complete in 'a couple of months' and that it featured a 'significant amount of instrumentation' that would allow it to be compared against the digital modeling and prove out the service life goal of 8,000 flight hours for each T-7A. Flight-testing at St. Louis with the two PRJs continued and revealed some widely reported handling issues, such as wing-rock at high angles of attack. Further delays have been incurred by the need to clear a wide tolerance envelope for the aircraft’s escape system, which is based around the Collins Aerospace ACES 5 ejection seat. Specifically, this relates to safe ejection for different aircrew body weights, particularly regarding lighter-weight pilots. While the T-7A was digitally designed and manufactured from digital models using a methodology called full-size determinant assembly [FSDA], this hasn’t removed the need for rigorous flight testing and certification to verify that the modeling and simulations are accurate. The all-digital approach hasn’t removed all development risk, and test work has required additional time to be allocated for re-visiting problematic items. Although the low-rate initial production decision date has been delayed beyond February 2025, a decision is still anticipated by February 2026. Edwards testing The first of five EMD T-7As arrived at Edwards on November 8, 2023. It was followed by a second EMD jet and one of Boeing’s two PRJs – taking the test fleet at Edwards to three aircraft by the time of TWZ’s visit in October 2024. 'Testing will continue until we feel we can give the end user a product that they can use,' said Aronoff. 'When the program office and AETC decide to declare Milestone C, that’s when they'll start building low-rate initial production airplanes.' 'We work for Air Force Materiel Command and the Air Force Test Center. Specifically, the T-7 Integrated Test Force comes under the Air Power Foundation's Combined Test Force. We have three ITFs under this – the T-7 ITF, the F-16/T-38 ITF, and the Emerging Technologies ITF.' The first T-7A Red Hawk assigned to testing at Edwards AFB was the second engineering and manufacturing development aircraft. USAF/Todd Schannuth Todd Schannuth 'Everything we are doing in T-7 flight test is based on proving the contract, proving out all the things that the aircraft is supposed to do, and that starts with safety of flight and building up the flight envelope – how fast, how far, how high. It’s about verifying that the airplane is doing the things it's supposed to do per the letter of the contract.' The flying at Edwards typically sees T-7As being crewed with one Boeing and one Air Force pilot, with all maintenance being conducted under contract by the manufacturer. 'We're very much hand-in-hand and integrated together,' explains Aronoff. 'We are the lead developmental test organization [LDTO] and Boeing is our partner, and we stay in lockstep with them. We make sure that when we're going to test something that they agree it’s something we should be testing, that the conditions are appropriate and that we're testing it in the correct way. It’s about making sure we are going after the right data in the right way to satisfy the contractual obligations to develop the airplane.' 'Currently, we are engaged in flight envelope expansion. We have one of the PRJ T-7s fitted with a spin-recovery parachute and we're using it to open up the high angle-of-attack envelope and fly the departure resistance type of flight testing,' Aronoff explained. 'We also have two EMD jets currently, one is instrumented for loads, noise, and vibration testing – opening up the structural envelope and understanding how the structure handles different maneuvers over time. This is about monitoring fatigue. We want to make sure that the engineering models for the T-7 are correct. We do that by measuring discrete test points – altitude, airspeed, and g-force combinations to verify that the model predictions are accurate.' 'The second EMD airplane at Edwards is our flutter test airplane. Think of the interaction between the structure of the airplane and the air around it. Think vibrations and the harmonics of the flight controls, and that's needed to open up the air speed envelope. We go to different altitudes and run flutter programs in the flight control system, which automatically shakes the airplane at different frequencies and amplitudes to try to excite a response. We can target specific amplitudes and frequencies that we are interested in and we can be very precise in how we gather data.' The second engineering and manufacturing development T-7A flies over Edwards AFB. USAF Bryce Bennett Aronoff says the T-7 work is the most precise flying he’s ever done. 'You have a control room of about 30 people watching your every move, and sometimes they tell you that what you flew wasn't good enough. You are trying something multiple times and they tell you that they need a cleaner set of data, but they can’t feel the turbulence, can't feel the heat of the mission, and they ask you to go do it again. That’s my job, to gather data for the engineers to verify the airplane is doing what it's supposed to do.' 'Right now, we're still very much building that safe envelope to operate in and flying with kid gloves. I need to be very precise in how I fly the aircraft. We’re talking plus or minus a couple of knots, plus or minus 50 feet, executing a certain amount of g, plus or minus 0.2g normally. Very tight tolerances, because we need as clean of a data set as possible. We're streaming that data in real-time to the control room so they can look at the squiggles and make sure it’s the right amplitude, the right frequency, and do real-time analysis. If it’s a good data point, we can move on to the next event.' 'With our high angle-of-attack campaign, when we do a maneuver, and see if the aircraft responds the way we thought it was going to respond? As long as it's matching our model, we keep marching along. It's when there's a slight deviation from the model we have to look at why it deviated to check that it’s within acceptable bounds. Our loads tests are conducted in the same way. When I pull 6g, is the g-distribution around the airplane matching the model? In flight testing we predict, test, validate. We predict results, we then go out and test, and then we validate the model that we use to predict.' The third EMD T-7 completed a month-long trial of extreme weather inside the McKinley Climatic Laboratory in Florida earlier this year and it's now back in St. Louis for technical order validation and verification. 'They're verifying that the manuals for maintenance are written properly and accurately. EMD four is being used right now to do some ground testing for a new flight control law that's coming out, and the fifth jet is still in production,' says Aronoff. A T-7A Red Hawk seen frozen in the McKinley Climatic Laboratory chamber at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, in early 2024. USAF/Samuel King Jr. Samuel King Jr. 'I really want to stress the partnership. We are together on this every step of the way, and drawing on Boeing’s experience and expertise that they have already built with the T-7. While the two PRJ aircraft did do a lot of really great stuff for the program, ultimately, there are changes between the PRJs and EMD jets, so we have to be very deliberate in our engineering mindset on how we develop the airplane.' Boeing implemented a number of modifications to the EMD T-7s to address lessons learned from the PRJs, and Aronoff is keen to stress that the current test effort at Edwards has earned a lot of credit for the work that Boeing did with the PRJs early on. 'The outer mold line of the airplane is essentially the same, but things like the onboard computers have changed, the software we're running is a little bit different and there are small changes throughout the airplane that are different enough that we need to verify them.' 'Manufacturing design is a very difficult time in flight testing, especially in developmental work because if you find anything wrong, you're generally going to have to stop, investigate, then come up with a fix before you continue,' Aronoff explained. 'So by nature of where we are in testing, we expect a slower schedule than anyone would really want.' 'No program has ever gone through testing on its original software. We're going to find things that need attention, and that’s our job. If I'm not finding things, I'm not looking hard enough. In general, there's always things in the operational flight program software that we can do better. The contract and the requirements are spelled out for us, and so we continue to iterate on things until it meets the contract requirement – that's the measure of performance.' 'Our duty is to get the airplane fielded as quickly as it makes sense to, so that it's safe. If you think, for example, of the worst instructor pilot and the worst student pilot combination ever, we have to make it safe enough for them. Yet we also have to make the airplane able to challenge the next Chuck Yeager, so it’s really finely tuned to suit the best of the best as well as those that need a little more help.' The changing world of military pilot training Military pilot training is evolving. Fighter aircraft have become easier to fly in some respects, but they feature increasingly complex mission systems and information flow. Holding airspeed, altitude, and heading is still important for young aviators, but the emphasis in training has evolved to include employing the weapon system effectively to help streamline the path to advanced front-line fighters. 'The T-7 is a very high-performance airplane. It’s very powerful with a lot of thrust, and it will be a great challenge for student pilots. I wouldn’t say that stick and rudder skills aren't important – they're extremely important – but they aren’t the most important thing that we need to emphasize in modern pilot training. One of the big elements that separates the T-7A from the T-38 is the ability to download mission system tasks into the cockpit,' Aronoff explains. 'Theoretically on day one of pilot training, a student could be logging onto a data link, could be setting up different screens and fighting that information overload. Ultimately, the end user [Air Education and Training Command] will tailor a syllabus to build the product, in this case the student pilot that they need. We are providing a tool that enables that.' BTX-1 and the first engineering and manufacturing development T-7A fly together over Edwards AFB. USAF Christian Turner The T-7A cockpit features a side-stick control column and a customizable large area display, or LAD. 'You can have up to four different portals up, including mini portals, and you can have a different format for each portal,' Aronoff explains. 'It’s extremely customizable, which is going to challenge the students in terms of managing all of the information. They will need to decide what’s important, and what isn’t. What size screen do they want, how will they use the HOTAS [hands-on throttle-and-stick] controls, or are they going to use their fingers, because it's a touchscreen display. How do they find the information they’re looking for, and what information do they want displayed at any one time?' 'The student can fly, for example, with a moving map on the right screen, a weapons display in the middle screen, and maybe a simulated targeting pod on the left screen. Will the display look like a Raptor display, an F-35, an F-16? No, but all the relevant data is there. That’s not to say the jet isn’t capable of doing that in the future. It just wasn’t a requirement for the T-7A to mirror any specific aircraft’s displays.' The T-7 ITF is primarily evaluating the T-7A from an Undergraduate Pilot Training, or UPT, perspective. The first step in jet training. However, it also has a keen eye on the future application of the T-7 in the follow-on introduction-to-fighter fundamentals, or IFF, which is being taken into consideration. 'Every time we fly the airplane, even now, we’re looking at how an instructor would employ it. Every time I’m in the back seat of the T-7A I’m thinking like a UPT instructor. We have a diverse team here with T-38, F-15, F-16, and F-35 guys, and as we test the T-7A we evaluate it for future profiles that we will tackle later on in the program, such as an introduction-to-fighter fundamentals profile, where a student and instructor will go and fly a BFM [basic fighter maneuvres] sortie, for example.' The T-7A is not equipped with a radar or targeting pod, and sensor data is synthetically generated in the avionics for training purposes, and can be shared via data link. The aircraft cannot carry any training weapons such as practice bombs and weapons employment in training will all be simulated. In fact, the only external store the T-7A is mandated to carry is a travel cargo pod. AETC is concurrently working closely with Boeing on development of the T-7A simulator, which will be an important part of the overall syllabus. Aronoff says that right now for every hour of live flying the team undertakes, it spends two or three hours in the simulator honing the different mission profiles. 'For all of the data-gathering maneuvers we need to fly on a sortie, we rehearse them in the simulator. At Edwards we currently just have the one simulator and we also make a lot of use of the Boeing simulator that they have in St. Louis.' USAF and Boeing test pilots are jointly undertaking test flights at Edwards AFB. Jamie Hunter 'One of the big things I always get asked about as a T-38 instructor is landing from the back seat of the T-7A. In the T-38 this is somewhat of a traumatic experience, with very limited forward visibility. I’m pleased to say that the T-7 tandem cockpit has much better forward visibility thanks to that stadium seating.' Breaking new ground Unlike the 1950s and 60s, when new military aircraft types were emerging with regularity, the T-7A program is one of the rare times in modern military aviation where a brand new aircraft type is being flight-tested. 'Almost every time we fly the T-7 here at Edwards we're doing something that's never been done in the airplane before. That’s exciting because I can say I'm the first person to go this fast or this high in the airplane. Some people look at me strangely when I tell them I'm really excited about putting this airplane out of control and doing departure suitability testing. We’re doing brand new developmental testing on a brand new airplane.' 'I like to emphasize that it can be a straight pilot training aircraft, where you fly and learn how to do aerobatics, learn how to land a jet, things like that. You can also tailor it in a live virtual constructive [LVC] environment where you have three or four actual wingmen with you fighting your classmates who are down on the ground in the simulator. The instructor can ramp up or down the scenarios, whatever the student or the training desires.' 'Fundamentally, the way we're going to produce pilots will change. They can learn how to turn on the radar on their first flight in the T-7 if they want that. Students that are doing well and flourishing are going to be able to move forward a lot quicker with the T-7.' 'Ultimately, it’s up to AETC to decide how they want to unlock all of these features, but with the T-7 we have all the right tools in place to dramatically advance military pilot training in the USAF.'

V-BAT Drone Has Proven Its Ability To Operate In Heavily-Conteste...	Shield AI’s novel vertical take-off and landing V-BAT drone is growing in stature, with steadily increasing orders, a new variant, and most notably with a recent series of successful missions flown over Ukraine. While in that war zone the drones were able to deliver reliable effects despite operating in the most dense electronic warfare combat environment in the world. V-BATs were initially tested in Ukraine in June 2024 to evaluate how they performed in the face of just this kind of enemy interference. According to a Ukrainian report the V-BATs were able to operate unhindered, even when they flew very close to Ukrainian jamming systems. A follow-up battlefield experiment in Ukraine in August saw V-BATs locate Russian surface-to-air missile (SAM) batteries before relaying targeting data back to Ukrainian forces so that M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HiMARS, could attack and destroy the SAM sites. V-BAT trials in Ukraine proved extremely successful. Shield AI The Ukraine experiments clearly demonstrated how V-BAT is able to operate in a highly complex modern battlespace, with its embedded artificial intelligence working hand-in-hand with its suite of onboard sensors. As a package, the V-BAT offers a relatively low-cost unmanned aerial system (UAS) capability with significant endurance that can take off and land nearly anywhere and can operate in cooperative swarms to tackle complex missions. These include intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and targeting tasks in higher-threat environments. Armor Harris is Shield AI’s vice president of aircraft engineering, where he leads the development of V-BAT. Harris came to Shield AI from SpaceX, where he was the responsible engineer for developing the propulsive landing capability on Falcon 9 and was also head engineer for the Starlink satellite constellation. 'In Ukraine, there has been a massive emphasis on a fourth-generation fighter capability in the form of the F-16, yet F-16s can’t get anywhere close to the front-line because of the surface-to air-missile [SAM] systems that are prevalent here,' Harris says. 'V-BAT is able to operate without GPS in a hostile communications-jamming environment. It can fly into an area, locate and identify targets, and fly missions way out ahead of fighter aircraft. Historically, the suppression of enemy air defense [SEAD] mission has been considered to be a role for fighter aircraft, but now we’ve proved in Ukraine that a V-BAT in the danger zone can team with a stand-off weapon such as HiMARS to execute the mission, which is a very effective strategy.' Shield AI's Armor Harris, pictured in the center. Shield AI The V-BAT’s ability to persist in areas where GPS isn’t reliable is a key part of its effectiveness, according to Harris. 'Part of being able to fly without GPS is about knowing where you are without GPS. If you're able to do that, you just need to refine that position estimate enough to generate target quality grids and tracks, and then pass that data back. V-BAT has a navigation system that doesn't require GPS, and a communications system that's able to operate in that highly jammed environment. We've put it up against the best jammers that Russia has, and it's been able to take those head-on.' 'We see a lot of small, one-way attack drones in Ukraine, but what makes V-BAT unique is that there’s nothing else in the theater that is comparable in its size category, that can be driven around in a truck, can launch vertically from pretty much anywhere, and carry sensors that are comparable with those carried on much larger aircraft.' The small drone with big missions Technological advances mean that mission payloads are shrinking in size. What 40 years ago may have required a U-2 Dragon Lady, or 20 years ago may have needed a large UAS to carry them, can today be accommodated by a drone as small as the 9-feet-long V-BAT. 'From a sensor standpoint, there’s a wide variety of electro-optical and infrared sensors that are carried in the nose of the V-BAT,' explains Harris. 'We can carry a couple of different models of Synthetic Aperture Radar [SAR] on the belly of the aircraft and a SIGINT [signals intelligence] payload that can be carried with antennas distributed across the aircraft. We also carry a wide area visual camera search system known as Visual Detection and Ranging, or ViDAR.' You can read more about Shield AI’s ViDAR system here. Shield AI has also developed a sensor payload known as Sentient Tracker, which combines artificial intelligence with Shield AI’s (formerly Sentient Vision Systems) moving target indicator. Its AI-enabled tracking allows operators to automatically detect moving objects within electro-optical (EO) or infrared (IR) full-motion video. 'During a recent demonstration, the Shield AI team performed a search over an area twice the size of Dallas, in about 90 minutes,' explains Harris. That demonstration enabled us to get an image file of every person and every single vehicle in that entire area. Comparing that to a moving target indicator radar image, for example, where you get loads of little dots on a map, with our system you get an actual image.' A V-BAT launches for a maritime mission. Shield AI The camera array on the V-BAT feeds raw data into a processing algorithm that's running onboard. 'The AI software sifts that data and downloads pertinent information to the ground station, along with the coordinates,' says Harris. This means there’s no requirement to transmit five different feeds of 8K video that would blow your bandwidth, you're just sending the things you really need to see. For example, you might see a vehicle driving down a street and with this system you have the resolution to decide if it’s weaponized or not.' 'While the V-BAT carries a smaller camera than some of the bigger platforms, and therefore it can't see as far, V-BAT is a one-million-dollar-class aircraft, so you can afford to procure and operate many more of them. Now you have a swarming team of four V-BATs monitoring that same area, which is a very powerful tool.' The V-BAT’s weapons capabilities elevate it from a versatile uncrewed aircraft system (UAS) to a powerful tactical asset. For example, in May 2023 during the U.S. Army Futures Command’s EDGE exercise, V-BAT successfully delivered a live glide munition known as Hatchet, a miniature precision strike weapon with GPS and laser guidance. This showcased its potential to deliver kinetic payloads with precision and efficiency. Configured with a 'belly bay' for payload delivery, and with a new generation of V-BAT being equipped with wing hardpoints for external payload carriage, the V-BAT offers the flexibility to serve as a long-range, reusable loitering munition capability, further enhancing its battlefield utility. Armor Harris inside the V-BAT production facility. Shield AI Superiority through mass Intelligent teams of drones are being developed to tackle a range of modern-day missions. A team of V-BATs not only offers a versatile range of mission roles, but also adds a level of survivability. 'There are three basic methods that we consider relevant in terms of survivability in a contested environment,' Harris explains. 'The first is to be faster than everybody else, which is what the SR-71 Blackbird did – it could outrun the interceptors. The west has also invested heavily in stealth designs to avoid a platform being targeted by radar, but that has resulted in platforms becoming dramatically more expensive over time. The third way, and part of the rationale behind V-BAT, is to be more numerous than your opponent.' Harris says if you can beat the cost curve, you can operate greater numbers of platforms, and therefore potentially operate in a denied environment just as effectively as the exquisite platforms. 'We’ve seen genuine realization that you can in many instances achieve the mission of a multimillion-dollar-class super exquisite aircraft with a team of much cheaper, more numerous, drones. Sure, some of them might get shot down, but those that survive will be able to complete the mission. There’s also the matter of getting them to where you need to launch them. V-BAT doesn’t require a huge airfield and doesn't need a complex refueling operation to get to where it needs to be.' 'In the Cold War it was all about mass. Then it evolved to be about exquisite capabilities. Now, the technology has evolved again, and we are right back at mass again, and that's really been enabled by autonomy. The fundamental limiters were cost and the number of trained pilots, and not wanting to put those highly trained pilots at risk. Today, with the ability to operate autonomous aircraft, it unlocks mass once again.' V-BATs ready to be shipped. Shield AI V-BAT on the rise Shield AI has delivered about 250 V-BATs to date, which are in service with a range of operators in the U.S. and around the world. In some cases they have replaced legacy unmanned intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) platforms of various sizes, and in others they have been used to establish completely new drone programs for customers. U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) and the U.S. Marine Corps have now been joined by the U.S. Coast Guard as a third domestic V-BAT operator. 'We will start flying with the Coast Guard in 2025,' says Harris. 'Operators are realizing that V-BAT is quite unique. It can do much of what an MQ-4 or MQ-9 can do, but they can launch it anywhere and carry it around on the back of a truck or on a ship.' 'During the recent operations in the Persian Gulf, the U.S. Navy has been launching waves of fighter aircraft, burning a lot of gas, operating fully loaded and waiting for Houthi targets to appear. They’ve been bottlenecked by the ability to find, fix, and engage these fleeting targets quickly, because they’re up against a smart adversary. The Houthis are popping up, launching, and quickly going back into hiding. You actually need a persistent, wide area search capability to pinpoint these kinds of targets fast.' 'We see the targeting mission as being extremely critical. If we can target, we can support a stand-off weapon as a far more effective combination.' V-BAT operations are highly automated, and Harris says it’s as simple as touching on a digital map where you want it to operate. 'We have settled on four aircraft as a V-BAT team, partly because of what we have seen during operations in the Red Sea. The Houthis have been able to down some of the larger drones, so four V-BATs give us some redundancy while being able to cover the same search area as a single larger Group 5 drone.' Shield AI's facility in Texas is the heart of V-BAT production. Shield AI The Batcave Shield AI manufactures V-BATs at its plant in Dallas, Texas, known affectionately as the 'Batcave,' and Harris says the company can easily build one V-BAT per day, and that the facility is capable of supporting a daily production rate of six-to-10, or more. 'We manufacture approximately half of the components in house and the other parts that are supplied to us are mainly machine parts, composites, as well as cast and forged parts. Our new generation of V-BAT that we are launching soon is the first to field a heavy-fuel [JP-5 and Jet-A] engine, where the previous engine ran on gasoline. From a logistics standpoint this will make a huge difference with integration to militaries around the world.' Harris says the new V-BAT iteration also provides fully autonomous launch and landing, which will be entirely without operator intervention. 'The current V-BAT requires a groundcrew to set it up, to stabilize it ready for launch, and to control it for initial take-off and landing. The new version does away with all of that, you can just stand it up on its small launch pad and literally press go.' 'V-BAT has a huge throttle range, which makes the powerplant pretty challenging to get absolutely right, because it’s a big beast to get vertically off the ground, but then once it’s airborne you want maximum endurance, that means burning as little fuel as possible while in the air.' V-BATs on the production line in the 'Batcave.' Shield AI The priority for V-BAT employment is to stay on station for as long as possible, which can be in excess of 12 hours. 'It actually wants to fly very slow, around 50 knots in loiter mode, but it can also dash at a faster speed,' Harris explains. 'It will also generally sit up at around 15,000 feet, which is a big advantage as it’s away from a lot of the ground threats.' 'The new variant is slightly bigger, and its take-off weight has increased from 130 pounds to 155 pounds. So, you can carry more fuel, more payload, and it has longer endurance. Having a lot more computer power onboard is also going to open up all kinds of missions that current V-BATs aren’t undertaking today.' The level of expertise and technological knowhow at Shield AI is a critical enabler of the types of advanced capability that the company is developing. It places huge emphasis on the quality of its engineers, who are working at the bleeding edge of drone and AI technology. 'In the U.S. over the last 20-30 years, too few talented young people in technology and engineering have considered working in defense. With the global situation, even a small percentage of these engineers could make a significant impact.' 'This is technology that drives the outcome of conflicts, making it critical to attract more talent to this space.

Dressing For Success At 70,000-Feet Aboard The U-2 Dragon Lady	As the U.S. Air Force’s U-2 Dragon Lady spy plane enters the twilight of its career, opportunities to get a glimpse into its critical mission and unique mode of operations are becoming increasingly sought after. In the past, TWZ has reported on civilian photographer Blair Bunting’s flight into the stratosphere in the cockpit of a two-seat TU-2S and the spectacular imagery he brought with him back to Earth. Now, Blair has followed that up with an account of his preparation for that same mission, focusing on the life-support elements that are exclusive to the Dragon Lady. Blair’s latest account, which you can read in full on his website, brings to the forefront how the U-2 mission relies entirely on the pilot’s pressure suit, also referred to as the 'spacesuit' — and the broader life-support equipment — to ensure its success. The pilot of a U-2 Dragon Lady spy plane photographed by Blair Bunting, part of the series 'Photoshoot at the Edge of Space.' Blair Bunting Blair Bunting With a rare chance to ride in the cockpit of the U-2, Blair became well acquainted with the workings of the Physiological Support Division, or PSD, as he went through the long preparations for his flight at Beale Air Force Base, California. Eight months before the TU-2S lifted off with Blair aboard, the photographer was at Beale, getting familiarized with the base, the squadrons, and especially the spacesuit. 'On the third day of my initial trip [to Beale], I was required to don the suit and sit for over an hour working through how to drink and eat, and what to do when I needed to go to the bathroom,' Blair recalls. 'I put on a brave face, but the truth is, I was scared shitless.' As for the spacesuit — or full-pressure suit in Air Force parlance — this piece of kit really is remarkably similar in concept and design to those worn by astronauts. It is made of three layers of Nomex material and weighs 90 pounds. The suits are provided in around 12 different sizes, based on pilot body size, and are further customized with adjustable panels in the torso, arms, and legs. Each Air Force U-2 pilot has two suits, and each one costs about $125,000. A U-2 pilot photographed by Blair Bunting. Blair Bunting Blair Bunting Flying in excess of 60,000 feet above the Earth, a loss of cabin pressure could be fatal for U-2 pilots, meaning ‘the suit is life’ and its upkeep is the responsibility of the physiological support division at Beale. 'If the cabin pressure fails, a controller on the suit will inflate it to an atmosphere of about 35,000 feet,' Sergeant Hawley, a launch and recovery supervisor for the 99th Reconnaissance Squadron explained in a previous Air Force media release. 'If that fails, a second system will inflate it to about 37,000 feet. As a last resort, the helmet will create an atmosphere of about 39,000 feet. That’s a high altitude, but it’s better than 63,000 feet where they can’t survive.' A two-seat TU-2S Dragon Lady of the kind that Blair Bunting flew in. U.S. Air Force One of the Air Force's two-seat TU-2S trainers. USAF After all, at 63,000 feet, human blood will boil since there’s not enough pressure to sustain oxygen in the bloodstream. Nitrogen flows out of the solution, leading to decompression sickness, or ‘the bends.’ As well as the spacesuit, U-2 pilots also breathe 100 percent oxygen for one hour before the flight to try and rid the blood of most of its nitrogen, mitigating the risk of the bends. 'It was not on the flight, but rather the day before, as I was sitting in a pressure chamber testing my spacesuit one last time, that I realized how absolute my reliance on it would be,' Blair reflects. 'I was well aware of the extreme risk to anyone who had the misfortune of being ejected from a U-2. Yet, I took solace in knowing that because of this multi-layered suit, there would at least be a chance — although small — of survival should that situation become a reality. One of the images that came from Blair’s flight in a TU-2S, Other more mundane thoughts were running through Blair’s mind at this point, such as what to do if his nose began to itch at altitude, with no way to get within the pressurized 'glass fishbowl' encasing his head. Breathing exercises and mental meditations became an important part of his preparation to deal with these kinds of psychological stresses. Meanwhile, Beale’s Physiological Support Division was responsible for preparing the suit as well as the food and drinks and would also be driving Blair to the plane and strapping him into it, connecting his suit to the generators, and making sure the seal around his face was tight. In fact, so impressed was Blair with the PSD team that he returned to Beale six months after completing his photo-shoot flight. This next assignment was all about recording the work of the men and women in the background of the U-2 enterprise, but without whom its mission would be impossible. Blair trying out his fitted pressure suit prior to the actual mission. Blair Bunting For this next photo-shoot, Blair chose to document four of the key interactions that he had had with the PSD team in the run-up to the flight: pressure checks for the suit in the chamber, suit integration, the ride to the flight line, and stepping to the plane. It’s in the chamber that the U-2 pilot starts to breathe the 100 percent oxygen and it’s an impressive space by any measure. In a black-painted room the size of a house, concealed behind a foot-thick door, is a chair for the pilot. While being fed the oxygen from a yellow bottle, they are attended to by two members of the PSD team, wearing masks and helmets. The activity is observed from a control room, behind a thick pane of glass. In a stark reminder of the dangers of depressurization, a water bottle next to the pilot’s chair shows them how bubbles would course through their bloodstream, were the worst to happen. As for the suit integration part, Blair was limited here as to what he could photograph, due to operational security, but this portion of the preparation involves donning space underwear, of the crotchless type, to accommodate a catheter (or Urinary Collection Device). Next, actually getting into the spacesuit is a process that requires 20 people (plus a media team and assorted spectators from the base). Entering the suit is a case of ‘diving’ into it, 'folding forward and pushing my head into the main O-ring,' says Blair. 'While not visible from the outside, the feet are actually part of the suit and are then covered up by a secondary external boot.' A U-2 pilot is integrated into his spacesuit. Blair Bunting Blair Bunting 'Once you are zipped up (from the crotch to the bottom of the neck), you are walked to a chair that looks like a motorized La-Z-Boy on a platform. Along the wall are gauges, tubes, and headphones. On the armrests lay thin white gloves that will serve as a barrier between your hands and the suit itself. One of the members asks if you want your air conditioning tube on the top or bottom of your wrist.' Next, the helmet is put it on and locked to the suit’s O-ring to the suit, then the gloves are slid on and attached to the suit, and the visor is closed. 'Things move quickly. The chair is promptly reclined, and five or six squadron members dive in, pulling and tugging on straps, running through checklists, taking oxygen measurements, and adjusting the suit,' Blair adds. 'The realization hits you that the operating room you just entered is your own, and these people are here to keep you alive. It is as equally terrifying as it is inspiring.' A U-2 pilot during the ride to the flight line. Blair Bunting Blair Bunting The next image shows the ride to the flight line, in a truck nicknamed the ‘bread van.’ The pilot at this point is still hooked up to the oxygen tank and the van has two more La-Z-Boy-style chairs for the pilot (or pilots, for a TU-2S mission). A U-2 pilot in the ‘bread van.’ Blair Bunting Blair Bunting Finally, Blair documented the walk to the aircraft itself. At this point, the truck drops the pilot off outside a hangar, in which ground crew are already busily getting the Dragon Lady ready for flight. Understandably, Blair’s return to Beale six months after his own flight triggered his own memories of the mission and his own ‘stepping to the jet’ for an unforgettable journey to the edge of space. Earth from (near-)space. As recorded during Blair’s U-2 flight. Blair Bunting Blair Bunting As for Blair’s incredible flight, you can read more about that in his own account. By any measure, a flight in a U-2 is a vanishingly rare occurrence for a civilian. Now, as the U-2 enters the end of its long service, such opportunities are only becoming rarer. With that in mind, it’s all the more fitting that Blair has paid homage to the iconic spy plane in such a remarkable way.

Extended Range AIM-120s, AIM-9s Eyed To Meet Future Air-to-Air Mi...	The U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy could soon be tasked with exploring whether extending the range of existing AIM-120 and AIM-9 air-to-air missiles is one path to help right-size stocks of those weapons. Congress is pushing for a broader assessment of U.S. air-to-air missile inventories amid growing concerns that obligations in the Middle East and Ukraine are eating into key munition stocks that would be especially crucial for any future high-end fight with China. An entire section dedicated to 'Assessments of Inventory Requirements for Air-to-Air Missiles' is included in the latest iteration of the annual U.S. defense policy bill, or National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), for the 2025 Fiscal Year. The text of the bill, which represents a compromise between previous House and Senate drafts, was released this past weekend. Navy sailors handle AIM-9X Sidewinders aboard a carrier. USN If passed and signed into law, the new NDAA would require the offices of the Secretaries of the Air Force and the Navy to 'develop recommendations to adjust the planned mix of missiles, including an assessment of whether extending the range or capability of existing air-to-air missiles would better support combined combatant command requirements at medium risk' no later than April 1, 2025. The air-to-air missile section would also prompt the Air Force and Navy Secretaries to do the following: 'Assess planned deliveries of air-to-air missiles through 2029 and the total available missiles by type in each year through 2029.' 'Assess combined requirements for air-to-air missiles to support operational plans of the United States Central Command, the United States Indo-Pacific Command, the United States Northern Command, and the United States European Command, at low, medium, and high risk.' 'Consider emerging requirements for surface-to-air defense and collaborative combat aircraft and how those additional missions will affect inventory requirements for air-to-air missiles.' 'Consider the sufficiency of planned acquisition for air-to-air missiles through 2029 to meet operational requirements.' 'Consider whether continuing production of the advanced medium-range air-to-air missile [AMRAAM] program of record through 2029 would enhance available inventories of air-to-air missiles.' The Air Force and Navy currently have two main air-to-air missile types in their inventories, the AIM-120 AMRAAM and the shorter-range AIM-9 Sidewinder. The two services are working together on a new longer-range air-to-air missile, the AIM-260 Joint Advanced Tactical Missile (JATM), details about which remain limited. The Navy has also fielded, at least on a limited level, an air-launched version of the multipurpose Standard Missile-6 (SM-6) called the AIM-174B, which you can read more about here. The Air Force has also been exploring other new air-to-air missile concepts, including compact and modular designs, in recent years. The possibility of further extending the range of the AIM-9 and AIM-120 is particularly notable given that U.S. officials have publicly presented AIM-260 as being intended to meet the demand for increased reach in aerial combat. The Air Force has also said that the emergence of China's PL-15 air-to-air missile was a key factor in prompting the development of the JATM, which is expected to have the same general form factor as the AMRAAM. China, as well as Russia, have been developing and fielding other even longer-range air-to-air missiles, along with airborne early warning aircraft and other capabilities that could help maximize the effectiveness of those weapons. Increasing the range of existing missiles could be another valuable option. The stated goal had been to start fielding the AIM-260 JATM by 2022, but there are no indications publicly that this has occurred despite very active testing of the missile. Whether this reflects issues with JATM's development to date is unknown. In the meantime, the latest subvariants of the current generation AIM-120D already have significantly greater reach than earlier AMRAAMs and there has been talk in the past of extending the range of the AIM-9X Sidewinder. Improved rocket motors with highly loaded propellants have been cited previously as a possible relatively low-effort way to increase the capability of existing missiles. The War Zone has explored in detail how a short-to-medium range variant or derivative of the AIM-9X, specifically, could offer a substantial boost in capability. A US Navy F/A-18E Super Hornet with a full load of AIM-120 and AIM-9X missiles. USN Building off existing designs would offer the additional benefit of being able to leverage present production pipelines and supply chains. Depending on what changes are required, older missiles could conceivably be upgraded to newer extended-range standards, as well. At the same time, the other portions in the air-to-air missile section of the latest version of the Fiscal Year 2025 NDAA underscores broader concerns about present inventories and the ability to not only replenish them, but expand their size, in the coming years. As one of the other provisions highlights, the Air Force and Navy are, at least publicly, looking to stop buying AIM-120s entirely by the Fiscal Year 2028-2029 timeframe, which might align with current plans for the AIM-260. 'Up to this year, where most of the employment of weapons were really artillery pieces and short-range weapons, I had said not at all,' U.S. Navy Adm. Samuel Paparo, head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM), said in November when asked about whether U.S. military aid to Ukraine and ongoing fighting in and around the Middle East was having a negative impact on U.S. military readiness in his part of the world. Paparo's remarks came at an open event at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, D.C. 'Now, with some of the Patriots that have been employed, some of the air-to-air missiles that have been employed, it is now eating into [our] stocks. … and to say otherwise would be dishonest,' he continued. When it comes to air-to-air missiles, AIM-120s and AIM-9Xs have been expended in the course of operations to protect friendly warships and commercial vessels from attacks by Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen and in the defense of Israel. Ukraine has been making significant use of National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems the U.S. military has helped provide, especially in combination with the AIM-120. NASAMS can also fire AIM-9Xs. A US Air Force F-15E Strike Eagle carrying AIM-120 and AIM-9X missiles flies somewhere in the Middle East. USAF This latter point highlights the additional provision in the latest version of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2025 that calls for looking at how 'emerging requirements for surface-to-air defense' will have an impact on all this. The U.S. military operates a small number of NASAMS to help defend the airspace around Washington, D.C. The U.S. Army is also in the process of fielding a new short-range air defense system called Enduring Shield, the primary interceptor for which will be the AIM-9X, at least initially. That, in turn, will create additional immediate demand for more Sidewinders. There are similar questions about what increased fielding of the AIM-174B might mean for the SM-6 pipeline, which is already under strain. A rendering of Enduring Shield launchers firing AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles. Dynetics As the latest version of the 2025 Fiscal Year NDAA highlights, questions about the mix of platforms that will be armed with air-to-air missiles in the future, including Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) type drones that the Air Force and Navy are pursuing, are another factor in these deliberations. Plans to deploy large numbers of CCAs, which the Air Force already envisions arming with AIM-120s and AIM-260s, together with crewed platforms would increase the total number of air-to-air missiles required for any single mission. The Air Force's plans for a new sixth-generation stealth crewed combat jet as part of its Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative) are now extremely uncertain, while the Navy says it is pressing ahead in the development of a similar aircraft referred to as the F/A-XX. The Air Force has also laid out much larger concerns about the affordability of a host of top-tier air combat modernization efforts. There has even been talk about the possibility of expanding the aerial combat role of the forthcoming B-21 Raider stealth bomber to help meet future requirements. However the Air Force and Navy might choose to proceed, calls to not only sustain, but increase air-to-air missile inventories are only likely to grow in the coming years, especially in the context of preparing for a potential high-end fight with China in the Pacific. Missiles like the AIM-120 and AIM-9X contain high-end and often unique components that can take months or even years to procure, which puts additional emphasis on making decision about new developments as soon as possible. 'We should replenish those [munition] stocks and then some. I was already dissatisfied with the magazine depth,' Adm. Paparo said bluntly at the Brookings event back in November. 'I’m a little more dissatisfied with the magazine depth. You know, it’s a time for straight talk.' Congress looks increasingly poised to demand the Air Force and Navy look into whether extended-range AIM-120s and AIM-9X, as well as other avenues, could help address future air-to-air missile needs.

New Syrian Prime Minister Assumes Power Amid Airstrikes, Continue...	Syrian rebels selected a new caretaker prime minister on Tuesday as the nation remains roiled by conflict after the overthrow of dictator Bashar al-Assad. Mohammed al-Bashir assumes office on an interim basis amid ongoing fighting in parts of the country and as Israel and the U.S. take advantage of the post-Assad power vacuum in the form of mass airstrikes. Bashir is a provincial leader aligned with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the former al-Qaidi-linked group that led the lightning 11-day offensive that toppled Assad. He will serve until March 1, 2025, Al Jazeera reported. His appointment was announced after meeting with members of the old Assad government. 'Today we had a meeting for the cabinet and we invited members from the old government and some directors from the administration in Idlib and its surrounding areas, in order to facilitate all the necessary works for the next two months until we have a constitutional system to be able to serve the Syrian people,' he told Al Jazeera.

Zelin (@azelin) December 10, 2024 Bashir headed the Syrian Salvation Government (SSG) in Idlib province before the rebel offensive and has close ties to HTS. A Facebook page of the rebel administration says 'al-Bashir was trained as an electrical engineer, later received a degree in sharia and law, and has also held posts in education,' Al Jazeera explained. HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Julani met outgoing Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi al-Jalali on Monday to discuss the transition to a caretaker government. However, the peace Syria will need to establish a cohesive, inclusive government seems elusive. Israel on Tuesday said it had largely completed its campaign of air and naval strikes on Syria’s air defenses, missiles and ships it dubbed internally 'Bashan Arrow.' However, Jerusalem has created what Defense Minister Israel Katz said on Tuesday was a 'sterile buffer zone' with ground troops in Syria. He later said it would be a temporary presence, though he offered no end date to the operation.

It is a roughly 400-square-kilometer (155-square-mile) section of the Golan Heights that was established after the 1973 Mideast war. The push marks Israel’s first overt entry into Syrian territory since then. New reports emerged on Tuesday claiming that Israeli forces in Syria 'have reached about 25 kilometers (16 miles) southwest of Damascus,' The Jerusalem Post reported on Tuesday, citing two regional security sources and one Syrian security source. 'The Syrian security source said Israeli troops reached Qatana, which is 10 kilometers into Syrian territory east of a demilitarized zone (DMZ) separating Israeli-occupied Golan Heights from Syria,' the publication reported. Israeli officials denied those claims, saying that they are 'completely incorrect. IDF forces are present inside the buffer zone and at defensive points close to the border in order to protect the Israeli border.' Like Katz, the IDF spokesmen offered no timeline for when Israel will withdraw its ground forces from Syria. The reports circulating in the media about the alleged advancement of Israeli tanks towards Damascus are false.

Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia have condemned Israel’s incursion, accusing it of exploiting the disarray in Syria and violating international law, The Associated Press reported. Turkey, a major backer of anti-Assad forces, also condemned Israel’s advance. The Turkish Foreign Ministry accused Israel of 'displaying a mentality of an occupier' at a time when the possibility of peace and stability had emerged in Syria. On Monday, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Israel’s incursion constitutes a violation of the 1974 disengagement agreement and called on both Israel and Syria to uphold it. Meanwhile, Israel released new details and video on Tuesday of its air and naval offensive against the remnants of Assad’s military. 'Within the last 48 hours, the IDF struck most of the strategic weapons stockpiles in Syria, preventing them from falling into the hands of terrorist elements,' the IDF said on Telegram. IAF and the Israeli Navy carried out 'over 350 strikes during the operation,' Times of Israel military reporter Emanuel Fabian stated on Twitter. The military estimates that it destroyed '70-80% of the former Assad regime's strategic weapons,' he reported. 'The waves of airstrikes carried out by IAF fighter jets and drones hit Syrian air defense systems, airbases, weapon depots, and weapon production sites in Damascus, Homs, Tartus, Latakia, and Palmyra,' he explained, 'The IDF says the airstrikes destroyed many long-range projectiles, Scud missiles, cruise missiles, coast-to-sea missiles, air defense missiles, fighter jets, helicopters, radars, tanks, hangars, and more. The Israeli Navy's strikes at the Minet el-Beida bay and Latakia port on the Syrian coast destroyed 15 Syrian naval vessels.' You can read more about the Navy's assault in our story here.

'Turkish proxies, with support from Turkish airstrikes, advanced today toward the town of Kobani,' AL Monitor reported. 'They began their push after seizing control of Karakozak, a bridge that connects the western and eastern banks of the Euphrates River, despite fierce resistance from Kurdish forces.' The attacks come as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan renewed vows to crush 'terrorist organizations such as ISIS and the [Kurdish Workers Party] PKK/PYD in other parts of the country as soon as possible,' AL Monitor explained.

The ISIS cells also arrested members who fled from the military service in the desert and Deir Ezzor after the regime of Al-Assad fell, according to SOHR. As we previously reported, over the weekend, the U.S. launched a massive series of airstrikes against ISIS, hitting over 75 targets using multiple U.S. Air Force assets, including B-52s, F-15s, and A-10s, according to U.S. Central Command.

Tice, a Marine veteran and freelance journalist, disappeared on Aug. 14, 2012, while he was reporting on the Syrian civil war. Weeks later, a short video appeared online that showed a distressed Tice blindfolded with his apparent captors. It was the last time he was seen. President Joe Biden expressed optimism that Tice could be returned to the U.S. in the wake of Assad's fall. 'We think we can get him back, but we have no direct evidence of that yet,' Biden said at the White House Sunday. 'We have to identify where he is.'

Su-57 Felon’s Two-Dimensional Thrust-Vectoring Engine Nozzle Brea...	Imagery has appeared showing Russia’s Sukhoi Su-57 Felon advanced fighter fitted with a new type of thrust-vectoring engine nozzle. The radical-looking exhaust design is intended to improve the low-observable features of the Felon, although the future of the new nozzle is far from certain. The videos and photos show the rear aspect of the second flying prototype for the Su-57 program, T-50-2, which was first flown in March 2011. It was subsequently used to test the improved AL-51F-1 (also known as izdeliye 30) turbofan, which was first flown in December 2017 — with just one of the engines installed in the aircraft, alongside one of the original AL-41F-1s. Video soon according to secretprojects forum user QuadroFX pic.twitter.com/MTIs0FjAaK&mdash; Fighterman_FFRC (@Fighterman_FFRC) December 10, 2024 What’s notable about the turbofan seen fitted in the left engine nacelle of the T-50-2 is its nozzle, which is an example of the new flattened version that is intended to equip the AL-51F1 once it’s installed in the improved Su-57M version of the fighter. So far, no orders have been placed for this variant of the aircraft. Another view of the flat version of the nozzle for the AL-51F1 (in the left engine nacelle), alongside the original three-dimensional version (right nacelle). via X The AL-51F-1 was developed as a ‘clean-sheet’ design, intended to offer increased thrust, lighter weight, and lower operating costs compared with the previous AL-41F-1. Another drawback of the earlier engine is its inability to provide the Su-57 with supercruise performance — flying over Mach 1.0 for sustained periods without using afterburners. At this point, it’s worth looking at the AL-41F-1, the original engine for the baseline Su-57, and its nozzle configuration. This turbofan is also used, in a simplified form, in the Su-35 Flanker multirole fighter. The AL-41F-1 (also known as izdeliye 117) was produced by modernizing the existing AL-31F engine used in the earlier Su-27 and Su-30 Flanker series fighters.

This is also known as three-dimensional thrust vectoring and provides pitch, yaw, and roll control. In its initial form, the AL-51F-1 also retains a similar three-dimensional thrust vectoring nozzle, but what we see in the new imagery is an alternative nozzle, this time of the two-dimensional type, which provide pitch control as well as limited roll control if engaged asymmetrically. It isn't clear if the angled installation of the nozzle is meant to provide extra control in the latter. The original three-dimensional thrust-vectoring nozzle for the Su-57, seen top, compared with the new nozzle of the two-dimensional type, seen below. via X This kind of stealthy ‘flat’ engine nozzle is also used on the F-22 Raptor, for example, and is primarily chosen to reduce radar signature compared with an axisymmetric nozzle design. It also provides infrared signature advantages, as well. A close-up view of F-22's distinctive thrust vectoring exhaust nozzles in action. Their unique 'hemispherical design' enhances F-22's stealth, even from the rear. In fact, it's said that not even the F-35 can match the F-22's rearward stealth capabilities. pic.twitter.com/9NHC8DECZQ&mdash; Air Power (@RealAirPower1) September 16, 2024 According to Yevgeny Marchukov, CEO of the Arkhip Lyulka Design Bureau responsible for the AL-51F-1, in comments reported by Aviation Week, Sukhoi was not interested in using a flat nozzle for the Su-57 when that program was launched. Only later was the two-dimensional nozzle ordered, after the Su-57 and the AL-51F-1 were flying. Since Sukhoi 'resists changes to the airframe itself,' Marchukov explained, 'That’s why we came up with a rather complex flat nozzle.' As seen in the diagram below, the nozzle has four independently controlled flaps, which work by modifying the air outlet cross-section and thrust vector. Of these flaps, which are installed at an angle, two are reportedly tailored for use in the subsonic regime and two for supersonic flight. The images also appear to show the vectoring flaps being vented, which, when combined with air forced through these areas, would help cool the exhaust and lower the aircraft's infrared signature. Two diagrams of the new nozzle from a company brochure. via X Speaking in the summer of 2023, Marchukov confirmed that the new nozzle had been successfully run on a ground testbed, including with afterburning. He added that a first flight was expected before the end of 2023, although there’s no record of whether that ever happened. For the Su-57, the flat nozzle would bring notable advantages in terms of improving its low observability from the rear aspect. The original design of the Felon optimized low observability from the frontal aspect, with less attention paid to the side and rear aspects. At the same time, the revised nozzles will reduce thrust output to some degree, but this is clearly considered a worthwhile penalty based on the improved low-observable aspects it brings, which are badly needed for the type. It’s also worth noting that another flat nozzle design has been developed for the version of the AL-41F-1 engine used in the Sukhoi S-70 Okhotnik heavy subsonic uncrewed combat air vehicle. In this case, the two-dimensional nozzle is intended to reduce the infrared and radar signatures, but it’s far simpler, without any vectoring controls. via X The Okhotnik was first flown with an interim engine, with a standard round nozzle, but the revised nozzle was fitted to the second aircraft, which was rolled out in December 2021, as you can read about here. As for the flat nozzle version of the AL-51F-1, its future rests very heavily on that of the proposed Su-57M. Work on this enhanced version of the Felon was already well underway when the Su-57 entered production and service, although, with only 76 examples of the original model under contract, it’s far from certain that it will progress further, at least in the near term. Also known as the T-50M, formal work on the ‘deeply modernized’ Su-57M began when Sukhoi received a contract from the Russian Ministry of Defense in October 2018. At one point there were reports of a T-50M prototype beginning flight tests in mid-2022, and series production by the end of 2024. Obviously, these targets have been missed, but if Russia — or an export client — does order more Felons, then this could help kickstart the Su-57M as well. At that point, we might get to see a production version of the two-dimensional thrust-vectoring version of the AL-51F-1 engine, as well.

Tilting Mark 41 Launcher Emerges During Guam’s First Aegis Ashore...	The U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA) conducted its first live intercept of a ballistic missile from the West Pacific island of Guam on Tuesday. The successful test also highlighted new details about the launchers used with the new Aegis Guam System, initial information about which The War Zone was first to report on. The test launch, dubbed Flight Experiment Mission-02 (FEM-02), is considered a key step toward providing 360-degree protection for the strategic outpost, which is on its way to becoming the most densely protected piece of land on the planet. It saw the Aegis Guam System fire a Standard Missile-3 Block IIA (SM-3 Block IIA) to intercept a mock air-launched medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM ). The target MRBM was successfully hit more than 200 nautical miles to the northeast of the island, according to the MDA and the U.S. military’s Joint Task Force-Micronesia. The U.S. Missile Defense Agency's successful intercept of a ballistic missile off Guam. (U.S. Missile Defense Agency) The Aegis Guam System fired the SM-3 Block IIA from a launcher based on the Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS). A picture released by the agency and Lockheed Martin, seen below, reveals that the launcher can actually tilt at least in one direction and can sit vertical for loading weapons and servicing. This is unlike the fixed launcher towers used in existing Aegis Ashore systems. We have reached out to Lockheed Martin, the defense contractor behind the launcher, for more information about this launch system and what benefits it offers. Tilting the launchers to the west, where threats would primarily emanate from, could potentially add a bit more range to some weapons. And every mile would count when it comes to defending the island from a multi-layered missile attack. (U.S. Missile Defense Agency) Missile Defense Agency (U.S. Missile Defense Agency) The test also marked the first end-to-end engagement utilizing the AN/TPY-6 radar during a live ballistic missile defense test, according to the agency, and is the first demonstration we’ve seen of the growing, layered and integrated air and missile defense web that will blanket the island. AN/TPY-6 is based on the same technology as the AN/TPY-7 Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR), according to manufacturer Lockheed Martin. The LRDR is currently used in Alaska, and was also planned for Hawaii, but funding has since dried up for the Hawaii effort, Inside Defense reported in 2023. Guam, about three times the size of Washington, D.C., hosts U.S. Navy combat vessels and rotational deployments of combat aircraft, along with many other capabilities, including military communications and surveillance systems. It is a central cog in the Pentagon’s strategic deterrence efforts in the Indo-Pacific region. During a crisis, the island’s port and airfields would be flooded with U.S. and allied troops and platforms. Few American missions in the region are arguably more critical than protecting Guam. As such, Beijing would place Guam and its U.S. Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps forces in the crosshairs should a full-scale conflict erupt. China’s growing arsenal of ballistic missiles pose the greatest threat to the strategic island outpost. (U.S. Missile Defense Agency) 'The future is focused on defending Guam and protecting forces from any potential regional missile threats,' the MDA said in a statement. Tuesday’s test was part of an ongoing buildup of the so-called Guam Defense System (GDS), which is also referred to in online military records as the Enhanced Integrated Air and Missile Defense (EIAMD) system. It will lean on as many as 20 new air defense sites bristling with surface-to-air interceptors, radars and other assets to counter an attack if war with China breaks out. The MDA test also showcased the joint, interlocking nature of Guam’s defense, and how that task would likely involve not only the U.S. military services, but regional allies as well. While the surrogate threat missile was tracked from Aegis Ashore, the Navy destroyer USS Milius (DDG-69) also detected, tracked and simulated engaging the ballistic missile, providing another layer of sea-based missile defense, according to Joint Task Force-Micronesia. Meanwhile, a U.S. Army Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) unit based on Guam also tracked the missile, while the Japanese destroyer JS Haguro (DDG-180) 'exercised its air defense support' as well. (U.S. Army) www.twz.com TWZ first reported on the plans for drastically beefing up Guam’s defense in August 2023, as military authorities worked to inform local residents of the effort and how it would impact their lives. The Aegis Ashore system that was used in Tuesday’s test is at the core of the Guam defense plan, but it looks very different from other U.S. Aegis Ashore sites in Romania and Poland, the latter of which was declared mission-ready in July 2024. Romania’s system has been in operation since 2016. While the final configuration of Aegis Ashore on Guam remains to be seen, the MDA has noted that it will be distributed to a far greater extent than its predecessors, and could involve certain components being placed in hardened underground facilities or road-mobile ground platforms, TWZ reported. Guam’s Aegis system differs in other ways as well, according to an October 2024 TWZ report that highlighted initial glimpses of the Mk 41 VLS there: 'Aegis Ashore is primarily designed to engage ballistic threats during the midcourse portion of their flight outside the Earth’s atmosphere using SM-3 interceptors. However, the Mk 41 is a modular launcher, meaning that additional anti-missile interceptors, such as the terminal-stage intercept and anti-air SM-6 and the forthcoming Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI), which could also be added. With its ability to take down certain incoming hypersonic threats, as well as other weapons, the GPI could be especially relevant for the defense of Guam. With additional launchers, even dispersed around the island, shorter-ranged missiles, such as the Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) Block II and even the latest SM-2s, could feasibly provide protection against air breathing threats, such as cruise missiles and drones. Patriot interceptors are now also now a possibility.' A map published by the MDA in October 2024 reveals 16 proposed sites across the island for air defense system assets, including Ritidian Point at Guam’s northern end, Naval Base Guam’s (NBG) Barrigada site in the middle of the island and a location within the Naval Munitions Site (NMS) to the south. (U.S. Missile Defense Agency) Another map shows nine radar arcs, including a comparatively larger arc projecting from Ritidian Point, which is now under the jurisdiction of the Marine Corps’ new Camp Blaz. (U.S. Missile Defense Agency) Other air systems that could engage various types of ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as fixed-wing aircraft and drones, during an attack include Patriot surface-to-air missiles, and lower-tier anti-air missile systems to include medium-range and short range (SHORAD) systems, as well as possibly directed energy weapons in the future. Go here to read more about the lower-tier capabilities that will protect Guam. Precisely when all the planned GDS pieces will be installed and ready to operate remains unclear, but officials have said they want at least some of the components operational by 2026. While much remains to be seen, Tuesday’s takedown of a ballistic missile threat underscored one way that the Pentagon plans to lock down Guam’s airspace in the event of crisis, and how it will need a panoply of systems to accomplish this vital task.

Russia Giving North Korea MiG-29s And Su-27s Isn’t That Straightf...	North Korea is set to receive MiG-29 Fulcrum and Su-27 Flanker fighter aircraft from Russia in return for Pyongyang having sent thousands of troops to fight in Moscow’s war in Ukraine. This is the assessment of the commander of the United States Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM), after much speculation about the nature of the support that might be headed to North Korea to reward that country for its growing military backing of Russia. The prospect of fighter aircraft being transferred by Russia is something that TWZ has discussed in the past but there are questions to be asked about how simple it will be to provide Pyongyang with serviceable MiG-29s and Su-27s — especially at short notice. Adm. Samuel Paparo, the USINDOPACOM commander, recently told reporters that Moscow and Pyongyang had reached an agreement on the fighter transfer. Speaking at the Reagan National Defense Forum in Simi Valley, California, Paparo notes that the aircraft involved were older, fourth-generation types, but were still 'formidable.' U.S. Navy Adm. Samuel Paparo, left, commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, gives two thumbs up after a successful strike during a joint exercise. U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Kurtis A. Hatcher Petty Officer 1st Class Kurtis A Hatcher Paparo also provided some other details about the deployment of North Korean soldiers to assist Russia in its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, as well as the counteroffensive directed against Ukrainian troops in the Kursk region. The admiral said that North Korea had provided the troops without prompting and that, although they have been deployed to combat zones, they haven’t yet seen active combat. This is contrary to other statements, including from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has said that North Korean soldiers are in engaged in combat on the front line. Regardless, providing troops — as well as significant quantities of arms, including huge numbers of artillery shells, and all the way up to short-range ballistic missiles — clearly seems to have paid off for Pyongyang. As we have discussed in the past, a Russian offer to revamp the aging Korean People’s Air Force (KPAF) would almost certainly be snapped up by North Korea. The most capable aircraft in the KPAF inventory are MiG-29 fighters and Su-25 Frogfoot ground-attack aircraft, followed by older MiG-23 Flogger swing-wing combat jets. Otherwise, its combat fleet comprises even more antiquated equipment, including Chinese-made H-5 Beagle first-generation jet bombers, Soviet-era MiG-21 Fishbeds and their Chinese F-7 equivalents, and Chinese-made F-6 Farmers — a first-generation supersonic fighter. Even F-5 Fresco jets —a license-built version of the MiG-17, which was first flown in 1950 — remain in KPAF service, although these are reportedly only now considered for suicide missions. Back in September 2023, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited the Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association (KnAAPO), based in Komsomolsk-on-Amur in the Russian Far East. This plant builds advanced fighters including the Su-57 Felon next-generation fighter and the Su-35 Flanker multirole fighter, the two highest-end single-seat fighters in Russian service today. Kim’s visit to KnAAPO led to speculation that advanced fighters might be headed to North Korea, which at that point was preparing to provide Russia with artillery shells and other materiel. At the time of the visit, Mikhail Degtyarev, regional governor of Khabarovsk Krai, where the KnAAPO facility is located, took to Telegram to provide details and the following statement: 'Our fathers and grandfathers fought together against Japanese militarism, our country supported North Korea in its fight against the United States’ imperialist ambitions in the 1950s, and today we jointly stand up to the pressure of the collective West.' Meanwhile, in our reporting of the visit, TWZ wrote: 'Clearly, the Su-35 and Su-57 jets produced by KnAAPO would represent a huge upgrade over the severely outdated equipment that North Korea’s air arm currently flies … [But] even if top-of-the-line Su-35s and Su-57s are not on the table, other less capable aircraft would still be a massive upgrade for Pyongyang compared to its existing fleet of older Russian-made jets … Almost anything available from Russia would be sought after, whether MiG-29SMTs, Su-27s, or Su-30s. Even a supply of spare parts and overhauls of its current types would be of great value to Pyongyang.' North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visits the KnAAPO aircraft factory, accompanied by Russian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry and Trade, Denis Manturov (third from right), on September 15, 2023. Photo by Gov of Khabarovsk Reg/M. Degtyaryov/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images Based on Paparo’s statements, it seems that only the MiG-29 and Su-27 are currently being lined up for transfer to North Korea, a decision that raises some important questions. After all, the presence in Russian military service of both the MiG-29 and Su-27 is now dwindling and these types are by now long out of production. Aside from a handful used for test duties and with display teams, Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) first-generation MiG-29s are now found only within one training regiment, and a frontline regiment based in Armenia. One less likely, but possible source of MiG-29s could be the aircraft that were refurbished for use by Wagner in support of the Khalifa Haftar’s forces in the Libyan civil war. These unmarked jets appeared at Russia’s Khmeimim Air Base in Syria, where we got a better look at them, before being deployed to Libya. The current status of these jets is very much unclear. An unmarked MiG-29 at Khmeimim Air Base in Syria. via @200_zoka The status of the more modern MiG-29SMT — a type that Russia inherited from a botched Algerian order — is a bit more complex. While these aircraft — which are multirole-capable — went into service at Kursk-Khalino, they have since been stored for a longer period. They would require some degree of overhaul to make them active again, were they to be transferred to North Korea. One of the former Algerian MiG-29SMT fighters seen in Russian service in 2013.

The 14th Guards Regiment used them between 2010 and 2019 at Kursk airfield, and replaced them with Su-30SMs, so the original Russian SMTs flew for just under ten years!!! pic.twitter.com/BXKiNikX3o&mdash; Eastern Order of Battle (@EasternOrbat) December 7, 2024 Russia's most advanced MiG-29s, the naval MiG-29KRs that are assigned to the country's only aircraft carrier's air wing, are an option, but also a questionable one. Handing those jets over to North Korea would mean the Admiral Kuznetsov carrier would only have aged Su-33s for its fixed wing contingent. Although the ship has not been to sea for many years and its refurbishment has been plagued with disasters and delays, it doesn't seem like Russia has given up on it, at least yet. MiG-29KR (Russian Navy) If Russia figures keeping a token carrier air wing intact is less important than keeping North Korea happy at such a critical time, the MiG-29KRs could be supplied. This would give North Korea the most capable examples of the type. Still, these jets have had their fair share of issues for Russia and the only other operator, the Indian Navy, having a rocky experience operating the type. As for the Su-27, these are also still in small numbers to test and training units and display teams, but frontline operators are now limited to four bases: Krymsk, Petrozavodsk-Besovets, Belbek in Russian-occupied Crimea, and Tsentralnaya Uglovaya. The associated units are now mainly in the process of being re-equipped with more modern Su-30 series or Su-35 Flankers. A Russian Su-27SM operated by the 4th State Air Personnel Preparation and Military Evaluation Center at Lipetsk. Dmitry Terekhov/Wikimedia Commons Overall, this doesn’t leave a huge inventory of readily available MiG-29 and Su-27 fighters for potential transfer to Pyongyang. Making these aircraft available to North Korea at short notice would leave gaps in the VKS fighter force — and potentially also eat into vital training capacity. Also, these hard-worked fighters are now very old, although that’s likely less of an issue for North Korea, used to working with vintage equipment. MiG-29s would make more sense for North Korea since the KPAF already operates them. On the other hand, there are fewer MiG-29s available in VKS use compared with the bigger and more capable Su-27, on which North Korean pilots and maintainers would require a longer period of conversion training. Two female pilots make an appearance in front of a MiG-21 fighter during North Korea’s first airshow in 2016. AP The other option would be to refurbish MiG-29 and Su-27 aircraft from the considerable numbers of these jets that are in long-term storage around Russia. This would be a long and expensive process, however, especially with Russian aerospace overhaul concerns already heavily engaged in supporting their domestic customers, especially to ensure serviceability among combat fleets for the war in Ukraine. It’s worth noting that, outside of the MiG-29 and Su-27, Russia would appear to have a readymade fleet of fighters for transfer to North Korea. A batch of more advanced Su-35s has already been built for Egypt, but that deal collapsed, apparently under U.S. pressure. A proposal to transfer to Iran some of the Su-35s has so far not materialized, which could leave them available for North Korea. On the other hand, Paparo’s statements, referring only to the MiG-29 and Su-27, would seem to rule that out and we still don’t know for sure if the Iranian deal will fall through. One of the Su-35s built for Egypt but never transferred to that country.@nskplanes Whatever the source of the MiG-29 and Su-27 aircraft apparently now headed to North Korea, they will be a welcome addition to the KPAF. But, as we have discussed before, they may well not be the only Russian defense products headed in the same direction. As well as fighters, North Korea would also almost certainly be interested in other Russian technologies, too, whether related to the modernization of other parts of its armed forces or to assist in furthering its own missile and space programs. There have already been indications that North Korea is due to receive air defense systems from Russia — potentially S-400 long-range surface-to-air missiles — and Pyongyang would very likely also covet specific other capabilities, including ballistic missile technologies, especially reentry vehicles, as well as new submarine technologies. On a broader military level, North Korea and Russia have ratified a mutual defense treaty, which calls for each side to come to the other’s aid in case of an armed attack. In addition, the growing relationship between Russia and North Korea has seen increased economic cooperation and energy shipments. Another intriguing dynamic in this affair involves the relationship between Russia and South Korea. While MiG-29s and Su-27s hardly change the power balance on the Korean peninsula, Seoul will likely be alarmed at the prospect of North Korea receiving any kind of defense aid from Russia. A spectator poses for photos before a North Korean MiG-29 during the second day of the Wonsan Friendship Air Festival in Wonsan on September 25, 2016. Photo by ED JONES/AFP via Getty Images ED JONES In the past, the South Korean Foreign Ministry has warned Russia of 'very negative impacts' on its relations with Seoul if it continues to expand its military cooperation with North Korea. This is especially ironic considering that Russia and South Korea previously had a military relationship of their own, primarily based around Moscow delivering various kinds of arms — including armored vehicles and anti-tank missiles — to Seoul as a way of paying back debts incurred during the Soviet era. For now, there are very many questions still to be answered surrounding the anticipated delivery of MiG-29s and Su-27s to North Korea. Importantly, however, these are older and significantly less capable than the more recent Su-35 and Su-57 that at one time seemed to be potentially on the table for Pyongyang. Moreover, their fairly limited presence in the Russian Armed Forces at this point means that it’s not entirely straightforward to deliver MiG-29s and Su-27s at short notice. Perhaps more importantly, however, is the symbolic value of such a transfer, further cementing the growing military partnership between Russia and North Korea, which is playing out in Ukraine and, which, before long, looks like it will also bring about a modest — but badly needed — modernization of the Korean People’s Air Force.

Israel Lays Waste To Syria’s Missile Boats	Pictures and videos have now emerged of the aftermath of Israeli strikes on the Syrian port of Latakia overnight, which destroyed at least six Soviet-era Osa II class missile boats. The targeting of Syrian Navy assets was part of a larger operation Israel launched involving hundreds of strikes aimed at preventing military assets from the now-defunct regime of Bashar Al Assad from falling into the hands of rebel factions.

Israeli ships reportedly employed unspecified surface-to-surface missiles to hit their targets in Latakia. The Israeli Navy does have a variety of corvettes and missile boats, including types capable of firing Harpoon and Gabriel anti-ship missiles, Naval SPIKE Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS), and loitering munitions. Regardless of the munitions employed, as already noted, available imagery shows at least six Syrian Osa IIs were destroyed in the Israeli operation. Also called the Project 205 missile boat, this is a 1960s-era Soviet design the primary armament of which is the equally dated P-15 Termit anti-ship missile (also known in the West as the SS-N-2 Styx). The P-15 is an active radar-guided missile with the baseline version having a range of 25 miles (40 kilometers) and the improved P-15M variant (which Syria is said to have received) extends that out to 50 miles (80 kilometers).

Syria previously acquired a mix of even older Osa I types, as well as Osa IIs, with the latter boats being the most capable surface vessels still in service in Syria to any degree prior to Assad's downfall. The available imagery shows other smaller craft were caught up in the Israeli strikes, which also damaged port infrastructure, as seen below.

Israel has also launched a ground incursion into Syrian territory, which it says is intended to provide a buffer amid the current uncertainty in its neighbor to the north. Israel's actions have drawn criticism from the United Nations, as well as from several countries in the region and the broader Middle East, including Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey. Otherwise, the situation in Syria remains extremely fluid. Various factions are now looking to consolidate their positions after one rebel coalition's lightning advance south to Damascus precipitated the downfall of Assad's brutal decades-long dictatorship this past weekend. Multiple foreign actors beyond Israel, including Russia, the United States, and Turkey, are also actively involved in the country's current affairs. Whatever happens in the coming days, weeks, and months, Israel has already delivered a significant blow to what was left of the Syrian Navy, as well as other military assets belonging to the Assad regime.

Syria’s Suddenly Permissive Airspace Prompts Flurry Of Foreign Ai...	The United States and Israel are capitalizing on the power vacuum left by the demise of the Assad regime in Syria. Israel has carried out a string of attacks that have taken out much of what's left of Assad's weapons caches, naval assets, air force, and air defense systems so they don't fall into the hands of whoever controls Syria next. Facilities tied to Assad's chemical weapons programs and advanced weapons development were also struck. This is in addition to Israeli armor moving into Syria deeper into the Golan Heights to establish a 'buffer zone.' The U.S. has also seized the opportunity to execute large-scale airstrikes across Syria against ISIS. All of this has occurred as Syrian airspace has suddenly become far more permissive than it had been. These actions come amid uncertainty about how the rebels will form a government and who it will align with given that Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) – which led the final uprising – is a U.S.-designated terror group. And considering how chaotic such transitions of power are, especially with so many competing factions in Syria, it's unknown if a wider civil war could erupt and create another even more nebulous power vacuum. It is clearly this uncertainty that the U.S. and Israel are trying to hedge against. Israel and the U.S. getting their licks in during this window of opportunity is something to see. Israel neutered Assad's legacy higher-end and 'unconventional' capabilities, U.S. went after ISIS. Mad scramble in the power vacuum.

That effort 'is a top-tier priority of ours, and making sure that anything with those types of derivatives, which is everything from chlorine to far worse is destroyed or cared for,' a U.S. official told reporters on Sunday. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, ruled out having U.S. troops on the ground in Syria to assist. 'I would not envision a scenario where we have U.S. boots on the ground for such a mission,' the official said. 'I think we have ways to take care of these things. But it is a primary focus.' The key to securing the chemical weapons is having Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) inspectors’ boots on the ground, David Adesnik of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) told us. 'The U.S. has ample incentives it can use to encourage Damascus to cooperate if its cooperation is for sale,' he said of relations with the government replacing Assad. 'We can adjust the speed at which we lift sanctions on Syria or contribute to reconstruction. Damascus also needs us to help broker a rapprochement with the Kurdish-led SDF, which is sitting on top of most of Syria’s oil and gas.' CENTCOM’s airstrikes came after President-elect Donald Trump stated on social media that America has no business in Syria, where there are still about 900 U.S. troops. Trump's reaction to the fall of Assad likely offered a preview into what could be a more hands-off approach to that country. 'There was never much of a benefit in Syria for Russia, other than to make Obama look really stupid,' Trump said on his Truth Social social media platform. 'In any event, Syria is a mess, but is not our friend, & THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT. LET IT PLAY OUT. DO NOT GET INVOLVED!' You can see that message below. '…THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT. LET IT PLAY OUT. DO NOT GET INVOLVED!' Says Donald Trump on his Truth Social about Syria while the US has its military presence in Syria. pic.twitter.com/vKUH36Q02g&mdash; Qais Alamdar (@Qaisalamdar) December 7, 2024 It should be noted that in 2017 when he was president, Trump ordered a Tomahawk missile strike on Syrian targets in response to Assad using sarin gas in an attack on Khan Shaykhun that killed hundreds. A year later, however, he decided with little warning and against overwhelming advice from his cabinet and senior advisers to rapidly withdraw all personnel from Syria and end combat operations in the country overall. That action spurred Defense Secretary James Mattis to resign. That move never came to pass before Trump lost his re-election bid to Joe Biden, who maintained a U.S. military presence inside Syria. As noted earlier, Israel is also bombing many targets in Syria and has moved more troops into the demilitarized zone separating the Golan Heights it occupies from the rest of Syria. The goal, according to officials in Jerusalem, is to improve Israel’s security situation by creating a buffer zone and dismantling 'strategic weapons systems' before they can fall into the hands of nefarious groups or even a future Syrian government. 'The only interest we have is the security of Israel and its citizens,' Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar told reporters on Monday. 'That’s why we attacked strategic weapons systems, like, for example, remaining chemical weapons, or long-range missiles and rockets, in order that they will not fall in the hands of extremists.' Saar did not provide details about when or where the strikes took place. However, Fox News reported on Twitter that the Israeli Air Forces (IAF) 'hit over 250 targets in Syria last night hours after U.S. bombers and strike aircraft dropped 140 satellite-guided bombs on ISIS&#8230;' IDF hit over 250 targets in Syria last night hours after U.S. bombers and strike aircraft dropped 140 satellite-guided bombs on ISIS.

Tehran’s ability to rearm that group will be severely hampered by not having Syrian or Russian air forces and air defense systems protecting what was already a porous sky from airstrikes on weapons storage facilities and transshipment points. For 35 years, the Assad regime helped Iran maintain a counterbalance to U.S. and Israeli influence in the region and now that's gone. However, Tehran still has the Houthis in Yemen and several militias in Iraq along with a defanged Hezbollah and a besieged Hamas in Gaza. Speaking of the Houthis, some leaders of the Yemen militant group are reportedly openly disparaging Assad now that he is no longer part of the so-called Axis of Resistance. It *is* news however that many senior officials in the upper echelons of the state in Sana'a can talk about it openly now that Assad has been toppled and fled his country in disgrace, and don't have to keep silent out of respect for internal axis cohesion.&mdash; روني الدنماركي (@Aldanmarki) December 9, 2024 After spending decades and billions backing Assad during the civil war, Iran is facing an internal backlash.

Meanwhile, the fate of Khmeimim Air Base and Tartus Naval Base - its two key military facilities located on the Mediterranean Sea - remains in question. You can read more about that in our latest piece here. The U.S. and Israel aren't the only ones bombarding targets in Syria, either. There is an ongoing proxy war between Turkey and Kurds, with both sides using drone strikes amid fierce fighting in the northern and eastern parts of Syria.

As we noted in the opening of this piece, the ferocity of these strikes are largely opportunistic in nature. Concerns about equipment and capabilities falling into the hands of current and potentially future enemies is one driver, but the ability to operate over the country freely is a new development. A complex arrangement of loose norms and constantly morphing deconfliction channels existed for some actors to share the airspace to a limited degree, but the western part of the country remained a relatively high-threat area. This is especially true when it comes to Israel's air operations. Often times the IAF would use standoff munitions to keep manned fighters outside of the highest-risk areas, if possible. With Assad's regime gone and the husk of his military in disarray, as well as Russia's degraded air picture and need to protect its immediate interests, now is clearly seen as the time to strike. Israel, in particular, is working to reduce the future risk of a hostile Syrian regime by neutering what was left of Assad's more advanced and deadly military capabilities. Thus the free-for-all of sorts in terms of the application of airpower over the country in the last 48 hours or so. The ongoing airstrikes in Syria come amid uncertainty about what kind of government the HTS-led rebel alliance will form. HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Julani has emphasized a new approach, delivering a message of inclusion. In a speech following the capture of Damascus, Julani said the Syrian people are the 'rightful owners' of the country after Assad's ouster and declared a 'new history' has been written for the entire Middle East, Al Jazeera reported. 'We [the Syrian people] are the rightful owners [of this country]. We have been fighting, and today we have been rewarded with this victory,' he said. However, there are still concerns about what direction Julani might take and if he can even wrangle enough of Syria's warring factions to create a stable government. Saudi Arabia, a Sunni nation that has battled the Shia Houthis in Yemen backed by Iran, is calling for 'unified efforts to safeguard Syria's unity and cohesion. These efforts are essential to protecting Syria from sliding into chaos and division, The Kingdom affirms its support for all measures aimed at achieving Syria's security and stability while preserving its sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity.'

'Qatar plans to speak with Mohamed al-Bashir, an HTS leader, on Tuesday, the day after he was appointed to lead Syria's transitional administration,' Reuters noted. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose forces are striking targets in Syria and pushing deeper into the country at any time since 1973, offered a mixed message on Monday about his nation's approach to a new government in Damascus. 'If we can establish neighborly relations and peaceful relations with the new forces emerging in Syria, that's our desire,' he said. 'But if we do not, we will do whatever it takes to defend the State of Israel and the border of Israel.' A U.S. official on Monday told The War Zone that it was too early to say what approach America will take to Syria's new leaders. However, Washington said it will assess not just their words, but their actions. 'After 14 years of conflict, the Syrian people finally have reason for hope,' U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement on Sunday. 'The Assad regime’s refusal since 2011 to engage in a credible political process and its reliance on the brutal support of Russia and Iran led inevitably to its own collapse. The United States strongly supports a peaceful transition of power to an accountable Syrian government through an inclusive Syrian-led process. During this transitional period, the Syrian people have every right to demand the preservation of state institutions, the resumption of key services, and the protection of vulnerable communities.' 'We have taken note of statements made by rebel leaders in recent days, but as they take on greater responsibility, we will assess not just their words, but their actions,' Blinken added.

Fate Of Russia’s Prized Syria Bases: What We Know	What will happen to highly strategic Russian air and naval bases in Syria is now very much now an open question following the downfall of long-time strongman Bashar Al Assad. Though Russia has pulled back forces, it is unclear whether there are plans to abandon the crucial facilities for good. There are now signs that the Kremlin could be looking to cut a deal with the same rebels it has spent the better part of the last decade fighting. The current situation in Syria is extremely fluid following the final and total collapse this weekend of the brutal decades-old Assad regime. It took the Command of Military Operations rebel coalition, with Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) at its helm, some two weeks to steamroll its way from areas under its control in the northwest to the capital Damascus. Other rebel factors, including U.S.-backed predominantly Kurdish forces in the east, had subsequently launched their own offensives.

Maintaining access to Khmeimim and Tartus, if feasible, would be a top priority for the Kremlin. As The War Zone has previously explored in detail, the bases are of great importance to Russia well beyond its operations in Syria. The Russian government has also spent considerable resources to expand their abilities to serve as strategic regional hubs for air and naval operations, as well as key logistics nodes, especially for activities across Africa. Tartus also notably provides the Russian Navy with its only current warm-water port facility with direct access to the Mediterranean.

Russian operations in Syria were characterized by at best indiscriminate attacks on areas full of civilians and at worst deliberate targeting of civilian infrastructure, especially hospitals. The Kremlin also worked to shield Assad's regime from broader international repercussions, including over its use of chemical weapons. Russian combat aircraft were flying sorties against anti-regime forces as recently as last week. There were also reports of ships in port at Tartus and/or forces ashore there firing missiles at rebels at they advanced. The Kremlin has made a further statement in this regard by giving Assad asylum in Russia, at least for now. Proof of this remains elusive. Regardless, doing so does give the Kremlin an additional bargaining chip as many groups are likely to be looking for accountability of various kinds from the former Syrian dictator.

He’s useless now, if there was a payment it already was received. Just a thought experiment.&mdash; Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) December 9, 2024 On top of all that, Russia officially designated HTS, which now says it is looking to form a transitional Syrian government, as a terrorist group in 2020. HTS evolved from the Al Nusra Front, which at one point was Al Qaeda's main franchise in Syria, but claimed to have broken away from the international terrorist organization in 2016. The United States and the United Kingdom, among others, have also officially designated HTS as a terrorist group. The U.S. has a $10 million bounty out on Jolani himself. HTS is also just one of a number of rebel factions that control substantial territory across Syria and which Russia has listed as terrorists over the years. This includes the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces in the east, which American authorities say they will continue to support ostensibly to guard against ISIS taking advantage of the current situation. Over the weekend, U.S. B-52 bombers, F-15 Strike Eagle combat jets, and A-10 Warthog ground attack aircraft struck dozens of ISIS-linked targets, underscoring that ongoing mission. However, over the weekend, President-elect Donald Trump also declared 'THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT' in a post about Syria on social media and has pushed for withdrawing U.S. forces from there entirely in the past.

Moscow has long had an on-again-off-again relationship with Ankara, particularly with regard to the Syrian civil war. The HTS-led advance from the north notably marked the final collapse of a ceasefire deal Russian and Turkish authorities had brokered in 2020. CNN Turk reported yesterday, without appearing to cite any sources, that Russia had requested Turkish help in withdrawing forces from the country, but also that the Kremlin would retain its Khmeimim and Tartus bases. At the same time, there are signs that the Kremlin is already looking, if possible, to engage with whatever regime now emerges in Syria. 'It's premature to talk about it yet,' Dmitry Peskov, spokesperson for Russian President Vladimir Putin, told reporters earlier today, according to Reuters. 'This is all a subject for discussion with those who will be in power in Syria.' 'Of course, everything is being done now that is necessary and everything that is possible in order to get in touch with those who can deal with security,' he added. 'And, of course, our military is also taking all necessary precautions.' 'We are in dialogue with Ankara and other regional states, including on Syrian affairs,' Peskov further noted. 'Indeed, Syria is going to have a very difficult period now, due to instability. And, of course, it is very important to maintain a dialogue with all regional countries here. We are determined to do this.' In this pool photograph distributed by the Russian state agency Sputnik on July 25, 2024, Russia's President Vladimir Putin (R) shakes hands with Syria's President Bashar al-Assad during their meeting at the Kremlin in Moscow on July 24, 2024.

'This new triumph, my brothers, marks a new chapter in the history of the region, a history fraught with dangers [that left] Syria as a playground for Iranian ambitions, spreading sectarianism, stirring corruption,' HTS leader Ahmed Hussein Al Shar'a, better known by his nom de guerre Abu Mohammad Al Jolani (or simply as Jolani), said in a victory speech yesterday, according to CNN. Jolani did not mention any other country by name. Iran had also been a major supporter of Assad both directly and through the Iranian-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. For groups like HTS, despite past history, Russia, along with China (which has called for a 'political solution' to Syria's future), may offer the possibility of more pragmatic and pliable partners, at least in the near term. The United States and the United Kingdom notably say they have no current plans to de-list HTS as a terrorist group. What happens now to Russia's prized bases in Syria, and its broader influence in the country, is uncertain, but there are signs that the Kremlin is not yet completely over.

UK’s 757-Based ‘Excalibur’ Avionics Testbed For Tempest Future Fi...	The United Kingdom has taken an important step toward its Tempest next-generation fighter, with the start of a trials campaign for the Flight Test Aircraft (FTA), nicknamed Excalibur, which will serve as a flying laboratory for the new combat aircraft. Based on a Boeing 757 airliner, the FTA joins a growing band of dedicated trials aircraft that are being used to prove out technologies for current and future-generation fighter programs, also in the United States and China. In a joint statement today, the two prime contractors responsible for the FTA — Leonardo and 2Excel — and the U.K. Ministry of Defense announced that the aircraft has successfully completed its first phase of modification and flight testing. The aircraft has been fitted with new side and belly pods, which were assessed for stability during flight. The latest Tempest configuration. BAE Systems These fairings are designed to host the Integrated Sensors, Non-Kinetic Effects (ISANKE), and Integrated Communications Systems (ICS) that Leonardo is developing as part of its work on the Global Combat Air Program (GCAP) — the overarching effort that has the Tempest crewed fighter at its core. While GCAP involves the United Kingdom, Italy, and Japan, the Tempest also falls within the remit of the U.K.’s Future Combat Air System (FCAS) program. This is a wide-ranging effort that also includes advanced uncrewed platforms, next-generation air-launched weapons, networks and data sharing, and more. An earlier BAE Systems graphic from the Tempest program shows some of the key ancillary systems and technologies that are being developed alongside the crewed fighter. BAE Systems That the FTA was now in the air had been confirmed by several recent sightings of the aircraft operating out of QinetiQ’s Boscombe Down facility in Wiltshire, southern England. The FTA performs a test flight over southern England last week. Ian Turner At this point, the FTA has the fairings for the various ISANKE and ICS components, but the actual technology demonstrator systems are yet to be installed. It’s unclear exactly when these will be added, with today’s announcement only stating that it will start to fly with them 'within the next years.' Once installed, onboard scientists and engineers will then test and refine the systems during flight trials, de-risking critical technologies for the Tempest and GCAP/FCAS and accelerating the development program — if all goes to plan. Concept artwork of the 757-based Excalibur flying testbed. 2Excel Before that, Excalibur will undergo further engineering work at Boscombe Down, which will include adding a fighter-style nose cone, to host the Tempest’s advanced new radar. This radar is being developed by Leonardo under the Multi-Function Radio Frequency System program. Artist’s renderings of the final FTA configuration also show additional fairings under the nose — perhaps for an electro-optical sensor — and on the side of the nose. Two further fairings are also shown below the rear fuselage. A computer-generated artwork shows the final planned Flight Test Aircraft (FTA) configuration. 2Excel A close-up of the forward fuselage fairings on the Flight Test Aircraft (FTA). 2Excel In the past, 2Excel has stated that Excalibur is planned to have a maximum payload capacity of 16 tons and will operate at an altitude of 42,000 feet at speeds as high as Mach 0.86. The aircraft has a maximum range of 3,900 nautical miles and an endurance of eight hours. While there’s a long tradition of using surrogate aircraft as avionics testbeds, it’s interesting that the narrowbody 757 is forging something of a niche in this field. Honeywell’s 757 testbed with an HTF7000 turbofan engine installed on the aircraft’s third pylon for a test-flight program. Honeywell In the United States, Honeywell has long used a 757 for test duties, while Boeing’s 757 Flying Test Bed — better known as ‘The Catfish’ due to its unique and highly modified nose profile — is used in support of the F-22’s sensor and electronic warfare suite. It features a Raptor nose grafted onto the forward fuselage, containing the AN/APG-77 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar. A swept-wing section atop the flight deck houses conformal antennas for the Raptor’s AN/ALR-94 electronic support measures suite. A close-up of the Boeing Catfish. @Task_Force23 The Catfish also seems to have influenced at least one similar platform operated by China. Here, a specially adapted Russian-made Tupolev Tu-204C — itself essentially a clone of the 757 — is used for avionics testing for the J-20 stealth fighter. According to the prime contractors, the British FTA program 'remains on schedule and is proceeding at pace.' Previously Leonardo has said that Excalibur will begin its Tempest flight tests between 'mid-2026 and mid-2028.' A high tempo is certainly a prerequisite of the program since plans call for a supersonic crewed fighter demonstrator aircraft for the Tempest program to be in the air by 2027. Then, the finished Tempest fighter is expected to be in service by 2035. As we reported earlier this year, the building of the demonstrator for the Tempest, so far only known as the Flying Technology Demonstrator, is now underway at the BAE Systems facility in Warton, northern England. As of this summer, over 50 percent of the aircraft, by structural weight, was already being built or had been completed. The demonstrator takes shape on the production line at Warton. Team Tempest As well as the demonstrator’s crew escape system — tests of which have apparently been completed — there has been parallel work on the powerplant. Aerodynamic engine testing has taken place at the Rolls-Royce facility in Filton, England. With the Flying Technology Demonstrator primarily concerned with proving the configuration and dynamics of the Tempest design, it will be down to Excalibur to test the major subsystems. At the same time, there will be a heavy reliance on simulation, including using a digital representation of the Flying Technology Demonstrator that has already been ‘flown’ extensively. In the meantime, the future of the Tempest has begun to be questioned in some quarters. In particular, as the U.K. Ministry of Defense is grappling with budget cuts, which have seen it prematurely retire a range of current assets. This has led to some concern that defense spending priorities may affect future air power efforts, with one possible outcome being a reduction in the priority assigned to the Tempest program. The 757-based Excalibur flying testbed during a test flight prior to its conversion. 2Excel Ultimately, the Tempest could find itself competing for funds with various other big-ticket defense programs, including new nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines. There is also the fact that the United Kingdom is currently still planning on procuring more F-35B stealth fighters, although the exact fleet size for the U.K. Lightning Force has yet to be finalized. Alongside this, there are all the regular challenges involved in developing a new fighter from scratch, especially one incorporating stealth technologies. In programs like these, long development times and high costs are the order of the day. With that in mind, the work of the Excalibur Flight Test Aircraft will be even more important, to ensure that the Tempest program meets its highly optimistic targets.

Australian Navy Fires Tomahawk Cruise Missile For The First Time	Australia has become just the third country to launch a Tomahawk land-attack cruise missile (TLAM) after the Royal Australian Navy’s (RAN) Hobart class destroyer HMAS Brisbane (DDG-41) successfully test fired the long-range weapon for the first time during its current deployment off San Diego, the RAN announced Monday. Australia now joins the United States and the United Kingdom in having the capability. The test fire comes as Brisbane is in the midst of a so-called 'interchangeability deployment' off the American West Coast, and the X account WarshipCam spotted the destroyer pulling in and out of Naval Base San Diego over the past week. Brisbane spending time in SoCal reflects the ever-deepening military ties between Washington and Canberra. The TLAM’s 1,000-mile range instantly beefs up the RAN’s firepower over great maritime distances, a welcomed capability should war with China break out. They can strike ships or shore targets, and they would be a very well-proven standoff weapon in a fight where Beijing seeks to keep the United States and its allies at a distance via anti-access defenses. Tomahawks can also loiter over a target or be tasked to hit another target mid-flight via a satellite data link. Australia isn't the only nation in China's vicinity to pursue Tomahawk missiles. Japan inked a $2.35 billion deal with the United States to acquire 400 of the missiles and support equipment in January 2024, USNI News reported then. 'The successful test firing of the Tomahawk missile demonstrates the strength of our alliance and defence cooperation with the United States, in support of a peaceful, stable and prosperous region,' Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Richard Marles said in a statement. 'By enhancing our own Defence capabilities, and by working with partners, we change the calculus for any potential aggressor so that no state will ever conclude the benefits of conflict outweigh the risks. HMAS Brisbane fires its first TLAM. (Royal Australian Navy) (Royal Australian Navy) The three-ship Hobart class–which in addition to Brisbane includes the class namesake, HMAS Hobart (DDG-40), as well as the destroyer HMAS Sydney (DDG-42), is a sound home for the Tomahawk. The 7,700-tons displacement warships were all commissioned between 2017 and 2020 and are considered Australia’s most modern and capable surface combatants, even as the force moves on plans that would grow the fleet via smaller frigates and optionally crewed warships loaded with missiles. Go here to read TWZ’s past coverage of that vision. Australia is looking to buy more than 200 Tomahawks, both for their Hobart class destroyers and for future platforms, the defense ministry said. The U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency announced last year that the ally had requested to buy up to 200 Tomahawk Block V All Up Rounds, and 20 Tomahawk Block IV All Up Rounds, as well as the associated equipment required to field them, for $895 million. Aside from Tomahawks, it’s been a time of change and new capabilities for the Hobart class in recent years. The Sydney successfully fired an anti-ship Naval Strike Missile (NSM) in August 2024 during the multinational Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise, Richard Thomas at Naval Technology reported. The NSM, with its stealthy design and secondary land-attack capability has been gaining in popularity with fleets around the globe, including America’s, and replaces the Harpoon anti-ship missile aboard those Australian warships. It is slated to be installed on the destroyers and the Anzac-class frigates under a deal inked in 2023, USNI News reported. HMAS Sydney (DDG-42) fires a Naval Strike Missile as part of Exercise Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) 2024. (Royal Australian Navy) LSIS Daniel Goodman Hobart successfully fired a SM-2 Standard Missile for the first time in 2019, according to the Australian government. In August 2024, Sydney fired Australia’s first SM-6 missile as well. That missile will be 'progressively deployed' aboard the class and on future Hunter class frigates, according to the government. The SM-6 is the only missile capable of taking on anti-air, anti-surface, strike and elements of ballistic missile defense, according to past TWZ reporting and its manufacturer, Raytheon. It was also reportedly used by a U.S. Navy destroyer to take out a Houthi anti-ship ballistic missile (ASBM). And as cutting-edge munitions come online for the Hobart class, the three ships have already been readied by Lockheed Martin to receive enhanced combat systems. The company announced in November 2023 that it had upgraded the class’ design architecture to support Aegis Combat System Baseline 9 capabilities. Baseline 9 will allow the Hobart class to defend against ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and enemy aircraft simultaneously, TWZ previously reported. USNI News reported in May 2024 that the Baseline 9 upgrade work will begin in 2026. Public records show the Hobart class currently sporting Aegis baseline 7.1. A Tomahawk missile fired from Australia's HMAS Brisbane (DDG041) heads for its target. (Royal Australian Navy) U.S. Navy The destroyers also feature 48 Mark 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) cells, which, along with SM-2 and SM-6 missiles, also pack medium-range surface-to-air RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow missiles (ESSMs). The ships are also fitted with a Mark 45 5-inch main gun, MU90 torpedoes, two 25mm M242 Bushmaster chain guns and a Phalanx Close-In Weapons System (CIWS). While it remains unclear when the Hobart class will have all its newer Aegis and weapons systems in place, Brisbane’s deployment turned historic when it fired the Tomahawk. Australian Defence reported that the ship will be home after Christmas following a five-month, so-called 'interchangeability deployment.' A Tomahawk missile fired from Australia's HMAS Brisbane, moments before impacting it's target. (Royal Australian Navy) U.S. Navy Australia’s 2021 announcement that it would buy Tomahawks from the U.S. for its Hobart class came a day after the U.S., U.K. and Australia announced plans to provide the RAN with nuclear-powered attack submarines under a trilateral agreement known as AUKUS. TWZ has previously reported what AUKUS will mean for Australia’s undersea capabilities, which will involve nuclear-powered boats armed with conventional weapons: 'The U.S. plans to sell Australia between three to five Virginia class submarines that carry Tomahawks loaded in vertical launch tubes systems (VLS). However, the first of those boats won’t be delivered until the early 2030s, pending Congressional approval. The new class of SSN AUKUS will also have VLS tubes capable of launching Tomahawks, but they are not currently scheduled for delivery to RAN until the early 2040s.' While the Australian subs are still years away, AUKUS has already produced increased ties, including American boats stopping for maintenance Down Under. The Virginia class sub USS Hawaii (SSN 776) was the first U.S. boat to do so in August 2024. In addition to turning western Australia’s HMS Stirling naval base into a nuclear sub hub, rotational deployments are also being planned there for American and British boats. The Virginia class attack submarine USS Hawaii (SSN-776) departs Australia's HMAS Stirling base after undergoing maintenance. (U.S. Navy) Lt.Cmdr. Rick Moore To prepare for their own nuclear fleet, the first cohort of Australian officers has gone through the U.S. Navy’s nuclear education pipeline, and the first seven enlisted Australian sailors graduated from the U.S. Navy’s Nuclear Power School in October 2024. Meanwhile, Australian entry into club Tomahawk appears to be restricted solely to the Hobart class destroyers for now. Canberra announced in June 2024 that its six Collins class diesel-electric attack submarines won’t be getting the TLAM capability, which will leave the RAN’s undersea force with a firepower gap for years to come, TWZ previously reported. You can read more about that decision here. Brisbane’s Tomahawk firing once again showcases how Beijing’s rapidly advancing military capabilities have pushed traditional Western allies even closer together. Judging by the comments of some AUKUS nation leaders around the globe, that potential is not far over the horizon. 'We are doing everything humanly and legally possible to optimise the Royal Australian Navy’s surface combatant fleet as quickly as possible, as directed by the Australian Government,' Australian Defence quoted Australian Navy Chief Hammond as saying Monday.

Ukraine’s Drone Boats Are Now Shooting Machine Guns At Russian He...	Ukrainian forces say they are now using Sea Baby drone boats armed with heavy machine guns. The Security Service of Ukraine says the machine gun-toting uncrewed watercraft engaged Russian Flanker-series fighters, Mi-8/Mi-17 Hip helicopters, and Raptor patrol boats during a recent attack on targets on the occupied Crimean Peninsula around the Kerch Bridge. The Security Service of Ukraine (SSU, also known by its Ukrainian abbreviation SBU) released a video earlier today, seen below, that it said showed views through the targeting systems on the machine gun-equipped Sea Baby uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) during the attack on the Kerch Bay area on the night of December 5-6. Kamikaze drones were also reportedly involved in the attack, the results of which are not immediately clear. The SSU/SBU has been using Sea Baby USVs for more than a year now and the family has grown to include baseline kamikaze types and other versions with mounted rocket launchers. 'Intercepted Russian radio communication indicates that there are killed and wounded on board the helicopters. The helicopters themselves were significantly damaged and now require major repairs,' according to a machine translation of the caption accompanying the SSU/SBU video on YouTube. 'Also, SBU drones hit a barge carrying military equipment and equipment for the repair of the Crimean Bridge, which the occupiers are still unsuccessfully trying to restore after previous bombings by the Ukrainian special services.' The War Zone has not been able to immediately verify these claims independently. The video does show Mi-8/Mi-17-series helicopters (as seen at the top of this story) and patrol boats being fired on. A Flanker-type fighter is also seen at one point appearing to conduct a strafing run, but the footage does not clearly show the jet being engaged in return. The exact model of Flanker is unclear, but it appears most likely to be an Su-30SM variant from what can be seen, including its forward canards. Russian Su-30SMs regularly operate over and around the Black Sea including in sorties against Ukrainian maritime forces. Screen captures from SSU/SBU video showing, at left, a Flanker-series fighter conducting what looks to be a strafing run (muzzle flash appears to be visible) and, at right, a better look at the jet as it pulls away. SSU/SBU captures A grainy screen capture from the SSU/SBU video said to show another boat in the sights of a gun-armed Sea Baby. SSU/SBU capture When it comes to the actual weapon systems on the Sea Babies, they are 'equipped with large-caliber machine guns' of unspecified types and 'with ballistic programs for automatic guidance and auto-capture of targets,' according to the SSU/SBU video caption. 'These water drones were manufactured as a result of joint fundraising with UNITED24, monobank, Oleg Gorokhovsky, Sergey Sternenko, and Igor Lachen in February of this year.' The video shows views through electro-optical and infrared cameras, along with a targeting reticle and general user interface in line with that seen on remote weapon stations designed for use on ground vehicles and ships. No external views showing the weapon system installed on the drone boats, which could offer more insight into its capabilities, have emerged so far. Whether the gun-armed Sea Babies are also equipped to act as kamikaze drone boats or are intended to be recovered and reused is unknown. As already noted, this is not the first time that Sea Babies have emerged with additional external armament in addition to their internal explosive payloads. The SSU/SBU has employed versions armed with infantry-type shoulder-fired rocket launchers (reportedly RPV-16s loaded with rockets with thermobaric warheads) and 122mm Grad artillery rockets in the past.

The Russian military has also been implementing a still-growing array of defense measures against drone attacks from the sea and the air, as well as other threats, around the Kerch Bridge and other high-value targets in Crimea and elsewhere in the region. Reports of major Ukrainian USV attacks have notably slowed in recent months. As noted earlier, it remains unclear what damage the Ukrainian attack last week caused to Russian targets in the Kerch area. The emergence of the R-73-armed Magura Vs earlier this year already reflected increased aerial threats to Ukraine's USV operations. As The War Zone has highlighted in the past, the rocket-armed Sea Babies would also provide an additional way to still be able to prosecute attacks, at least on some level, in the face of expanding Russian defenses. Still, there are questions about the effectiveness of the new gun-toting Sea Babies and the general utility of employing the USVs armed in this way. The drone boats are already understood to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars apiece before the addition of the new weapon systems, which would be lost by design if they are still intended to end their missions in a kamikaze attack. Ukrainian decision-making regarding the allocation of its resources now comes amid renewed concerns about the future flow of military aid from the West, especially the United States. If nothing else, the new Sea Baby developments highlight the continued speed of iteration when it comes to uncrewed systems across domains being employed by both sides of ongoing the conflict in Ukraine. Whether gun armament ultimately proves worthwhile, Ukrainian forces are clearly continuing to explore ways to challenge Russian countermeasures to their USV operations.

V-22s Grounded Again After Special Operations Osprey Mishap	A mishap on an Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) CV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft last month has led to an operational pause for the U.S. military’s fleet of the aircraft, which are operated by the Marines and Navy as well. The Marines are pausing all non-essential flights. The Osprey was conducting a training mission at Cannon Air Force Base on Nov. 20 when it experienced 'a material failure' that forced the crew of four to make an emergency landing, AFSOC spokesperson Lt. Col. Becky Heyse told The War Zone Monday morning. There were no known injuries or external damage to the aircraft, she added. A CV-22 like this one from Cannon Air Force Base in New Mexico was forced to land on Nov. 20 after experiencing a material failure. (USAF) As they were flying, the crew started to 'get indications in the cockpit to land as soon as possible,' Heyse explained. 'The incident is under investigation, but the initial indications are that this was another material failure. We believe it was different than what occurred last year.' Heyse was referring to the November 29, 2023 mishap that killed all eight aboard a CV-22 operating off the coast of Japan. A subsequent investigation found that the crash was caused by 'a catastrophic failure of one of the tiltrotor’s gearboxes' and 'decisions made by the pilot.' From our story about the investigation: 'After an analysis of the parts of the left-hand [proprootor] PRGB that could be recovered, it was determined that the catastrophic failure in this instance was 'most likely initiated by a crack in one of the high-speed pinion gears and fatigue cracking of the associated pinion gear’s bearing cage. Additionally, at least one piece of the failed high-speed planet pinion wedged in the high-speed carrier assembly, grinding against the high-speed sun gear’s teeth until finally removed.'' In that flight, the pilot and crew did not 'plan for, deliberate, or even discuss' closer suitable landing options after they received the chip burn warning about the left-hand [proprotor gearbox] PRGB, according to the Accident Investigation Board report. The AIB described as an 'insufficient sense of urgency throughout the entire mishap sequence, beginning with the first PRGB cockpit advisory approximately 49 minutes prior to aircraft impact.' Heyse said it was too early to offer any details about the new material failure. Wreckage of the CV-22B Osprey off Yakushima Island, as photographed by the Japan Coast Guard, November 29, 2023. Japan Coast Guard The entire fleet of U.S. Ospreys was finally cleared to fly again in March, which you can read more about here. Now they are grounded again. 'Out of an abundance of caution, NAVAIR recommended an operational pause for all V-22 Osprey variants Dec. 6, 2024,' said spokesman Neil Lobeda. 'This decision comes following a recent precautionary landing of a CV-22. There were no injuries to the crew. The safety of our V-22 aircrew is our top priority. We are committed to ensuring our Sailors, Airmen and Marines are able to successfully complete their missions and return home safely.' All three services have paused their V-22 operations. 'We have a pause right now to our flight training operations, based on the recommendation from NAVIAR,' Heyse told us. 'In response to a NAVAIR recommendation on the V-22 Osprey fleet, the Marine Corps has decided to implement a 96-hour operational pause for non-essential flight operations starting on December 6, 2024,' a USMC spokesman said in a statement. 'This decision underscores our unwavering commitment to the safety of our personnel and the reliability of our aviation platforms. This pause will give us time to determine if any additional measures are necessary to ensure the continued safety and effectiveness of this critical capability. The Marine Corps remains confident in the safety and effectiveness of the MV-22.' Since the Osprey first flew in 1989, more than 400 V-22s have been delivered to the Marines, Air Force, and Navy, as well as the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF), the latter being the only non-U.S. operator of the type. The Marines are by far the largest operator of the Osprey, with some 348 MV-22Bs spread across 17 squadrons. AFSOC has about 50 and the Navy has 36, including one test aircraft. 210825-N-LN075-2010The Marines have paused flying their MV-22 tilt-rotor aircraft.

Navy CMV-22Bs.( U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Emma Burgess) The lessons learned from the fatal 2023 crash contributed to the Cannon crew’s ability to land safely, Heyse told us. AFSOC 'updated all procedures after the crash last year,' she said. 'The return to fly part was an increased focus on training and simulators. The initial indicators show that is why they were able to safely land, based on those flight control measures and training taken. We will learn more as the investigation continues. After the November 2023 mishap, all V-22s were limited to flying within 30 minutes of a suitable divert airfield. In particular, this limits the CMV-22's ability to operate from aircraft carriers. The main function of CMV-22B Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft is to perform aircraft carrier onboard delivery (COD). Marine Ospreys from HMX-1 also support presidential airlift mission, primarily carrying the press pool, aids, and Secret Service counter-assault team around, which you can read more about here. This is the latest mishap in a long string of problems for the Ospreys. Overall, the Bell-Boeing tiltrotor has had a checkered history, punctuated by numerous fatal crashes since its first flight in 1989, though U.S. military officials regularly point to a broadly improving track record in the past few decades. For now, we will have to wait and see how long this latest pause lasts, which material part failed, and whether other variants are experiencing the same problem.

Descend Into The Depths Of The Assad Regime’s Massive Bunker	The dramatic collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime over the weekend has yielded some extraordinary scenes across the country, including first glimpses into part of the secretive world of the Syrian dictator — as well as his brother’s labyrinthine underground bunker. Here you can get up to speed on the situation, with our blow-by-blow account of the rebels’ lightning dash to the Syrian capital Damascus, which led to Assad running away from the country — his destination was Russia, which he safely arrived at, according to Moscow's claims, but the exact whereabouts of Assad remain unconfirmed. Among the most remarkable imagery that has appeared in the wake of Assad’s fall is that which shows a huge and modern underground bunker complex, said to be deep beneath the Damascus mansion of Maj. Gen. Maher al-Assad, the disposed dictator’s brother. Maher al-Assad was best known as the leader of the Syrian Army’s Fourth Armored Division, an elite formation tasked with protecting the government from internal and external threats. Clearly he failed in that role.

The facility is so deep that it includes its own funicular-like trolly system used for descending into it. One video begins with an entry to the bunker via a door, presumably in the basement of the mansion, which leads to another reinforced blast door, followed by a staircase, under an arched ceiling. Another blast door then provides access to a much longer tunnel, descending deeper into the ground. Running alongside the stairs, this tunnel features the aforementioned steep, funicular-type railway for assisted and cargo movement access. Different underground chambers are linked with other levels via a spiral staircase. A long tunnel with access provided by steps as well as a funicular-type railway. via X Another view of the same tunnel. Most seem to feature a characteristic vaulted ceiling. via X The underground chambers include offices, sitting rooms, bedrooms, and bathrooms. Many of the rooms have their contents strewn across the floor, but it’s not immediately clear if they were simply ransacked or if desperate efforts had been made by the owners to remove certain important items in advance of the rebels’ assault. One particular room is protected by a heavy vault door, which may have been still locked when discovered. Regardless, we don’t get to see inside this area. An apparently still sealed vault within the bunker complex. via X A caption on one of the videos posted to social media read: 'Massive tunnel complex beneath Maher Assad’s mansion, wide enough for trucks carrying captagon and gold to drive through.' Captagon is another name for the drug fenetylline, which is illegal in most countries and is produced primarily for illicit use, especially in the Middle East. Reportedly, Syria is the largest producer of the drug, accounting for around 80 percent of the global supply. There have been multiple reports describing how revenues from captagon played a major role in propping up Assad’s regime and Maher al-Assad has been labeled as having played a major role in this narcotics trade. A domestic-sized vacuum machine, likely used in the production of narcotics. via X A shrink-wrap machine, also probably used in the production of narcotics. via X As well as gold and drugs, it’s rumored that the same bunker network was also used to store weapons, which would have been used to defend it and the Assad family had they been at the facility when it was breached. Overall, it’s noteworthy just how modern this complex appears. It is conceivable that Iran — which is well known to be very proficient at building underground complexes — might have assisted in its construction. Underground bunkers are used to protect key regime, command and control, nuclear, and weapons storage facilities in Iran, and similar types of bunkers have also appeared in Lebanon. With that in mind, the Maher al-Assad facility could give us an indication of what others look like in Iran. Similar architecture has long been a hallmark of authoritarian leaders around the world, more often than not the product of an unhealthy relationship between power, paranoia, and colossal wealth.

There were also impressive numbers of offroad vehicles, among them Toyota FJ Cruisers and Land Cruisers, and a Land Rover Defender.

Back in 2018 Assad was filmed allegedly driving his personal Honda Accord into a combat zone on the eastern outskirts of Damascus. As TWZ pointed out at the time, this was clearly propaganda play by the Syrian government, but the use of the no-frills Accord now makes an even starker contrast with the high-end carpool found at the palace. We are still at a very early stage of the post-Assad era and there is certainly much more to be discovered, not only from secretive locations belonging to the leader’s family and its acolytes but also the notorious prisons and other detention centers in which enemies of the regime were tortured and executed. Already, however, the picture is very much one of Assad — and presumably much of his family and close associates — having escaped the country with little to no effort being made to destroy anything left behind.

The Assad Regime Has Fallen, Claims Swirl Around Possible Crash O...	Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad boarded a plane to leave the country on Saturday, according to several media reports. His exit comes 12 days after a surprise uprising made a lightning dash to the capital of Damascus after capturing several major cities along the way. Meanwhile, there are claims that the jet carrying Assad either was shot down or had mechanical problems and crashed over Northwestern Syria. 'Assad left the country for an undisclosed location, fleeing ahead of insurgents who said they had entered Damascus after a stunning advance across the country,' The Associated Press reported, citing an interview with Rami Abdurrahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR). Abdurrahman told the AP that Assad took a flight Sunday from Damascus. 'Bashar Assad leaves for Russia with his family, and is expected to deliver his resignation speech in the coming hours,' the Step News Agency reported on Twitter. بشار #الأسد يغادر إلى #روسيا برفقة عائلته، ومن المتوقع أن يلقي خطاب التنحي خلال الساعات القادمة.#ردع_العدوان #دمشق&mdash; Step News Agency - وكالة ستيب نيوز (@Step_Agency) December 8, 2024 We must stress that the situation is very fluid and Assad's fate remains questionable at this time. New information could significantly change the prevailing narrative circulating in the media at this time. Assad’s reported flight came as the HTS-led rebels stormed into Damascus, The New York Times reported. 'The Syrian factions announced, at dawn on Sunday, that President Bashar al-Assad had left Damascus, calling on the displaced abroad to return to ‘Free Syria after declaring Damascus ‘free,’ while the commander of the Military Operations Administration issued a directive to his forces in Damascus to stay away from public institutions,' Al Hadath TV channel reported. 'The factions said in messages published via the Telegram that Bashar al-Assad had fled and 'we declare the city of Damascus free' adding 'after 50 years of oppression under the rule of the Baath, and 13 years of tyranny.'' The official Iranian Press TV also confirmed the end of the Assad regime. 'President Assad's rule ended: Syrian army command tells officers,' Press TV reported on Telegram. 'The Syrian army command has notified officers that President Bashar al-Assad's rule has ended as militants enter the capital Damascus, an officer says.' There are unconfirmed reports that the Il-76 Ilyushin transport jet that was supposedly carrying him was either shot down or suffered a mechanical problem. Based on its location, it may have been trying to reach Russia's airbase in Latakia, Syria. This has long been seen as among the safest place for the Syrian strongman. 'Unconfirmed information is being circulated about the sudden descent of the plane that was reportedly carrying Assad after it disappeared from radar and dropped suddenly from an altitude of over 3,650 meters to 1,070 meters in a few minutes, just outside Lebanese airspace north of Akkar,' Egyptian journalist Khaled Mahmoued posited on Twitter. '3D flight radar data of the plane suspected of carrying Bashar al-Assad indicates that it crashed. The Syrian Air IL-76 aircraft’s altitude dropped suddenly, and it seems it was shot down.'

The status of the Alawite enclave on the Mediterranean Sea coast, where Syria's port facilities and Russia's bases are located, remains unclear. Assad is an Alawite and he enjoys very strong support from the ethnic group within Syria's power architecture. The official Syrian SAMA-TV news channel claimed on Telegram that forces loyal to Assad had not withdrawn. 'There is no truth to the news circulated by terrorist media platforms about the withdrawal of the armed forces from the northern Latakia countryside, and the General Command confirms that all this news is false,' SAMA-TV claimed. President Joe Biden and his team 'are closely monitoring the extraordinary events in Syria and staying in constant touch with regional partners,' according to the White House press pool. President-elect Donald Trump hinted at what his foreign policy agenda might look like in regard to Syria, saying the U.S., which has about 900 troops in Syria, should not be involved in that country. 'There was never much of a benefit in Syria for Russia, other than to make Obama look really stupid,' Trump said on social media. 'In any event, Syria is a mess, but is not our friend, & THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT. LET IT PLAY OUT. DO NOT GET INVOLVED!' Israel, meanwhile, said it had reinforced the occupied Golan Heights border with Syria. Jerusalem is eyeing these events warily, wondering what stance HTS and other rebel groups will take toward Israel. 'The Chief of the General Staff emphasized the high level of offensive and defensive readiness, the reinforcement of troops along the border, and the continued monitoring of developments,' the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Telegram. 'He also stressed that, alongside these efforts, we are not intervening in events in Syria, are working to thwart and prevent threats in the area, and are preparing plans for various options. Due to developments, the IDF has reinforced its deployment along the border, including intelligence and reconnaissance units. Ground and aerial forces have been bolstered along the border, and sector readiness has been heightened.' There are unconfirmed reports that the Israeli forces have also advanced into Syria, to create a 'buffer zone' as a precaution. The IDF has not commented on this yet.

Bunker Talk: Let’s Talk About All The Things We Did And Didn’t Co...	Welcome to a slightly belated Bunker Talk. This is a weekend open discussion post for the best commenting crew on the net, in which we can chat about all the stuff that went on this week that we didn’t cover. We can also talk about the stuff we did or whatever else grabs your interest. In other words, it’s an off-topic thread. The caption to this week’s top shot reads: Storage-tunnel for nuclear missiles at an abandoned soviet military in Brandenburg State, Germany (FHM via Getty) Also, a reminder: Prime Directives! If you want to talk politics, do so respectfully and know that there’s always somebody that isn’t going to agree with you. If you have political differences, hash it out respectfully, stick to the facts, and no childish name-calling or personal attacks of any kind. If you can’t handle yourself in that manner, then please, discuss virtually anything else. No drive-by garbage political memes. No conspiracy theory rants. Links to crackpot sites will be axed, too. Trolling and shitposting will not be tolerated. No obsessive behavior about other users. Just don’t interact with folks you don’t like. Do not be a sucker and feed trolls! That’s as much on you as on them. Use the mute button if you don’t like what you see. So unless you have something of quality to say, know how to treat people with respect, understand that everyone isn’t going to subscribe to your exact same worldview, and have come to terms with the reality that there is no perfect solution when it comes to moderation of a community like this, it’s probably best to just move on. Finally, as always, report offenders, please. This doesn’t mean reporting people who don’t share your political views, but we really need your help in this regard. The Bunker is open!

USS Zumwalt Returns To The Water With A Hypersonic Missile Launch...	The USS Zumwalt (DDG-1000), a very large and stealthy Navy destroyer that has been beset by hurdles for much of its life, was put back in the water Friday after undergoing 14 months of work that saw its original and cost-prohibitive 155mm Advanced Gun Systems (AGS) replaced with launchers that will eventually fire Intermediate-Range Conventional Prompt Strike (IRCPS) hypersonic missiles. Photos released by shipbuilder HII don’t show much of the IRCPS, as its position on the deck where the big guns once stood is covered. Still, Friday’s news was years in the making, as the Navy first announced plans to remodel its tiny Zumwalt class fleet to field next-generation hypersonic missiles in November 2021. While the Zumwalt class was originally supposed to grow to 32 ships, the Navy ended up buying only three. Part of its original mission was gun fire support for amphibious operations, but the Navy never bought ammunition for its guns that would fulfill that role. This was largely due to the 155mm Long-Range Land Attack Projectiles (LRLAP) rounds fired from the ship’s two Advanced Gun Systems (AGS) costing $800,000 each. The USS Zumwalt (DDG-1000) back in the water after its hypersonic missile launcher upgrade. (HII) (HII) Ship costs also soared over their lifetime, from an original estimated $1.3 billion per ship in 1998 to more than $9 billion by late 2020, according to the Government Accountability Office. The fact that only three ships were purchased also meant that all development and future upgrade costs would only be spread across a tiny fleet less than one-tenth the size of what was originally planned. Citing the ongoing nature of the work, Naval Sea Systems Command declined to confirm what the hypersonic upgrades will cost. The future USS Lyndon B. Johnson (DDG-1002), the third and final ship in the class, will be the next to receive the IRCPS capability once Zumwalt’s work is done, Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) told TWZ this week. LBJ wasn’t built with the AGS installed, so less work will be needed to install the hypersonic missile capability, but the addition of the missiles will push the ship’s commissioning date from this year to 2027, according to NAVSEA. A rendering of USS Zumwalt (DDG-1000) firing a hypersonic missile. (Lockheed Martin) An artist's rendering of the USS Zumwalt firing a hypersonic missile. (Lockheed Martin) The second Zumwalt class ship, USS Michael Monsoor (DDG-1001), is operating out of San Diego and will get its own hypersonic capability installed during a future yard modernization period, although NAVSEA did not clarify when that will take place. Navy budget request records for this fiscal year show the sea service is looking to have all three ready to go by Fiscal Year 2028. While HII said they are not yet finished with the ship’s upgrade, Zumwalt’s eventual return to the fleet with a hypersonic missile capability marks the start of a potential redemption arc for the controversial class of ships. Partially due to its ammoless guns, the type has largely been one without a clear mission, despite the array of cutting-edge, albeit watered-down, technologies onboard. But IRCPS could prove the Zumwalt’s worth, because the hypersonic missiles the class carries would be reserved for very high-value, well-defended targets. They will be loaded into the ship’s triple-packed Advanced Payload Module (APM) cannisters that are now situated where the guns once were, according to past TWZ reporting. IRCPS and the U.S. Army’s hypersonic effort, the ground-based Dark Eagle Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW) system, are the same missile design and have a shared unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicle on top, with the only difference being how they are launched. (U.S. Navy) Such missiles will use rocket boosters to get their payload to the desired altitude and speed. At that point, the glide vehicle will separate from the rest of the booster and make its way toward its target through the atmosphere at very high speed along an unpredictable trajectory. Hypersonic velocity is defined as anything beyond Mach 5, but these weapons will far exceed that threshold. But it remains unclear when Zumwalt will head out to sea with actual hypersonic missiles onboard. The U.S. Army got its first Dark Eagle missile launcher prototype in October 2021. It scrapped three test launches in 2023. The Navy and Army conducted a test fire in June but have not disclosed the results. Navy budget requests in recent years indicated that the sea services wants to fire hypersonics from Zumwalt by the end of 2025. TWZ has previously reported on the benefits these speedy systems will provide: 'Boost-glide vehicles are also designed to be highly maneuverable, allowing for more unpredictable movements over the course of their flight compared to typical ballistic missiles, even those with advanced maneuverable reentry vehicles. This presents significant challenges for opponents in terms of detecting the incoming weapon and responding to it, including any attempts to intercept the threat. Giving an enemy less time to react also reduces their ability to relocate critical assets or just seek cover. All of this, in turn, means hypersonic weapons present an ideal choice for penetrating through even the densest air and missile defenses to strike high-value and potentially time-sensitive targets.' The U.S. Army's Dark Eagle hypersonic missile launcher. (U.S. Army) The U.S. Army's Dark Eagle hypersonic missile launcher. (U.S. Army) Each of Zumwalt's four large diameter tubes can fit three missiles, allowing for up to 12 in all, and the sea service will set requirements for how many missiles the ships will field for any given operation, USNI News' Mallory Shelbourne reported in November 2024. And while the Zumwalt class will be hypersonic-ready going forward, other facets of the ship remain unchanged. The Navy previously said the IRCPS capability doesn’t require extra space aboard the ship, and would instead take up the space previously used by the guns. DDG-1000s will continue to sport 80 Mk 57 Vertical Launch System (VLS) cells. A host of missiles could be loaded into the refitted Zumwalt, including SM-2 Block IIIAZ and Evolved Sea Sparrow surface-to-air missiles, as well as Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles and potentially variants of the SM-6 missile family. Despite the class’ capabilities being diluted over the decades, and while some external system add-ons have increased the class’ radar signature, their stealthy design could help the ships sneak within range of targets that sit inside enemy territory, something that would be critical to countering China’s long-range defenses in the Pacific. The Navy destroyer Michael Monsoor (DDG-1001) underway in 2002. (U.S. Navy) The Zumwalt class has a huge, 14,500-ton displacement for a ship categorized as a destroyer. That is about one-third greater than Flight IIA Arleigh Burke class destroyers. It also boasts a stealthy design and multiple spectrum signature reduction–including electromagnetic emissions, radar, acoustic and infrared–that make it largely unprecedented for a ship of its size. Zumwalt can also generate a gaudy 78 megawatts of electricity, enough to power nearly 10,000 average American homes. And even while speeding along at 20 knots, the ship class still holds a sizable 58 megawatts of reserve power. The destroyer’s cutting-edge Integrated Power System means enough power has been kept in reserve to provide current to next generation radar systems and directed energy weapons. Still, with just three ships in the class, all packed with unique hardware, the cost of sustaining and upgrading these ships, including their stealthy features, will be hefty over time. There is talk of potentially replacing their proprietary radar and combat system with versions of the Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar (EASR) and Aegis Combat System to help with sustainment.

(HII) While they have ventured into the western Pacific, the class has not been on a traditional cruise. But now that Zumwalt is approaching a final baseline configuration, nearly a decade after it was commissioned into service, Navy brass are hoping it can be a next-level contributor to the fleet, even if that capability has come relatively late in DDG-1000’s life.

Former Trump Acting SECDEF Talks About The Future Of Big Ticket D...	The Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program, just punted by the Biden administration to the next administration, is one of many big-ticket defense initiatives that will be closely scrutinized by President-elect Donald Trump's national security team, his former acting defense secretary told The War Zone in an exclusive interview Thursday afternoon. These are decisions that will affect hundreds of billions of dollars in defense spending and tens of thousands of jobs. You can read more about yesterday's NGAD decision here. NGAD, described by the Air Force as a 'family of systems,' includes its crewed sixth-generation stealth combat jet. The Air Force was already conducting a deep review of its NGAD plans, due to be completed before the end of the year. A rendering of Lockheed Martin's concept for an NGAD sixth-generation stealth fighter. (Lockheed Martin) Lockheed Martin 'I feel it is highly likely that the incoming team will take a very careful look at all major acquisition programs and try to bring coherence to them, and more importantly, determine if these are the necessary capabilities to fight in the future operating environments that, frankly, these legacy systems are not optimized for,' said Chris Miller, who served under Trump from Nov. 9, 2020, until Jan. 20, 2021. He spoke to us as a former cabinet member, not a representative of Trump’s new administration. 'The defense primes have such outsized influence,' he said when asked about the future of NGAD and other programs. '[Frank Kendall] the Chief of Staff of the Air Force recognized NGAD needs to be relooked or rescoped.' Miller acknowledged that he doesn’t have 'in-depth knowledge to pass judgement' about NGAD, 'but I can say with a degree of confidence that the NGAD program and others …will get looked at and probably a determination will be how made about how this fits into the new era of warfighting. As we return from quantity to quality, how we use military force to deter our enemies - and if not, how to fight and win - is the overarching concept.' Miller, who dealt with the nuclear trident and hypersonic weapons procurement during his short time at the Pentagon, singled out several programs he surmises will likely be closely examined. Many are among the U.S. government’s biggest expenditures. Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). The B-21 Raider long-range stealth bomber. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Army systems like the Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) tiltrotor replacement for the UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter; Long Endurance ISR; the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle and the overall quantity of heavy armor. The B-21 Raider stealth bomber program is one of several that will be closely reviewed by the new Trump administration, his former acting defense secretary told us. (USAF) USAF In addition to specific weapon procurements, Trump's team will likely also scrutinize the Pentagon’s $1 billion Replicator program, Miller said. It was designed by the Biden administration to overcome 'the PRC’s biggest advantage, which is mass: more ships, more missiles, more people,' Asst. Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks said when it was first unveiled in August 2023. Former Acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller, who served under the last administration, says the new one will closely examine several big-ticket weapon system procurement plans. (Photo by: HUM Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) HUM Images In May, AeroVironment’s Switchblade 600 loitering munition was the first weapon the Pentagon announced by name that it would buy for Replicator. The follow-on Replicator 1.2 tranche announced last month includes - among other items - low-cost air vehicles that could evolve into relatively cheap cruise missiles. The Enterprise Test Vehicle (ETV) program, which the Air Force is running in cooperation with the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), was among a second tranche of 'capabilities' to get a boost through the Replicator initiative. At present, four companies – Anduril Industries, Integrated Solutions for Systems, Inc., Leidos subsidiary Dynetics, and Zone 5 Technologies – are currently building prototypes for ETV with the expectation that all of them will be flight-tested. 'Select ETV prototypes will be accelerated to scaled production,' according to the Pentagon’s Replicator 1.2 press release. The next tranche of that effort, dubbed Replicator 2, will focus on counter-drone capabilities but funding for that won't proposed to Congress until the Fiscal Year 2026 Presidential Budget request, according to a September memo from the Pentagon. There was 'a lot of disenchantment in the defense technology, and small business community that were held out of being part of Replicator,' explained Miller, now serving as Chief Strategy Officer for DYZNE Technologies, which develops defense-facing AI-enabled air, land, and sea systems. 'The vast majority went to a handful of nontraditional defense companies.' 'Being a member of the nontraditional defense industry, I can say definitively that a whole bunch of the smaller and midsize up-and-coming defense tech companies were really, really frustrated and frankly disgusted at the way Replicator played out,' Miller explained. 'I don’t know if Replicator will continue as Replicator, it’s a heavy lift, tied to legacy people. It seems much more like a public relations stunt than an actual meaningful method to deliver capability to fielded forces.' Earlier Thursday, we asked the Pentagon's top spokesman about the future of programs like NGAD, Sentinel and Replicator. 'I'm not going to speculate on what future administrations may do, but I can be very confident in saying that we'll do everything we need to do to defend this country,' Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder responded to our question during his afternoon press briefing. Miller said the wrong approach has been taken to how the U.S. buys its weapons. Currently, 'we have it flipped on its head,' Miller stated about the procurement of big-ticket defense items. 'We are developing capabilities and then forcing them into the warfighting concept. We need to get back to the tried and true method, make sure of what our warfighting theory of victory is, and then use that to develop capabilities, instead of individual services creating incredibly complex weapon systems that no longer fit into what we are trying to do.' The new administration, he added, is 'going to go deep into the numbers and have a hard look at whether the American taxpayer gets value out of these systems. We are operating off a very decrepit and poorly produced joint warfighter concept.' There's a lot riding on the mercurial Trump's approach to these systems and we'll have more answers after he takes office on Jan. 20. While he doesn't have any inside information, Miller has more insight than most about what Trump might do. 'Anyone who says they speak for Donald Trump is either lying or stupid,' Miller exclaimed. 'I'm speaking as a national security professional who worked closely with him in the past.'

B-21 Raider Numbers Could Be Boosted With Existing Production Cap...	Should the U.S. Air Force want to buy more of the new B-21 Raider stealth bombers more quickly, it would be able to draw upon capacity that’s built into the production effort, the boss of Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) has confirmed. The disclosure comes as the Air Force increasingly looks at the size of the future Raider fleet, something that is influenced by other new-generation air combat programs, as well as drone developments, and broader budgetary concerns. 'If the Department of the Air Force, the Department of Defense, or Congress directs an accelerated ramp … for the B-21 program, there’s some capability growth within the current complex,' Gen. Thomas A. Bussiere noted, during an event hosted by the Air & Space Forces Association’s Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies, yesterday. Air Force Global Strike Commander Gen. Thomas A. Bussiere. U.S. Air Force photo by 1st Lt. Aaron Chen Aaron Chen Bussiere was responding to a question about the possibility of ramping up B-21 production, including whether other contractors could become involved, in addition to Northrop Grumman. The AFGSC boss said he thought 'the most efficient way' of expanding production would likely 'require opening up another production complex' with Northrop Grumman. However, Bussiere’s response does suggest that there is now not only a possibility of making more B-21s but that there is also some kind of additional capacity for a production ramp-up already. The Air Force’s publicly stated plan has long been to buy at least 100 Raiders. However, as we have talked about in the past, there is the potential that the B-21 force could ultimately become significantly bigger, and this broader topic is the subject of high-level discussion right now. Bussiere thinks now is the right time to 'reevaluate' both the B-21 production total and the rate at which they are procured, noting that the rapidly changing security environment means there will be a greater need for the 'exquisite' capabilities offered by the stealth bomber. 'Who would not want more?' he asked. Noting again that the program of record calls for 'at least' 100 B-21s, Bussiere also pointed to the fact that, in the past, the previous Chief of Staff, Chief of the Air Force, and Secretary of the Air Force all went on record and testified before Congress that a fleet of 220 bombers would likely be needed to meet requirements. Taking into account the current plan to retain 75 upgraded B-52Js, that would require a fleet of 145 B-21s. 'It’s a force mix discussion within the Department of the Air Force, and it’s a resource and priority [question] within the Department of Defense [and] the nation,' Bussiere added. A B-21 Raider conducts a flight test out of Edwards Air Force Base, California. Photo courtesy of Jonathan Case, Northrop Grumman Photo courtesy of Jonathan Case, Northrop Grumman Back in October, Northrop Grumman — currently engaged in progressing ground and flight testing work — also disclosed that the total number of the new stealth bombers could change as part of a force structure review. Kathy Warden, Northrop Grumman’s CEO, talked about the review and added that the Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall 'has been open about looking at the various options they have for increasing their force size,' specifically in relation to the B-21 and NGAD. NGAD is the Next Generation Air Dominance initiative, which includes the Air Force’s crewed sixth-generation stealth combat jet. Yesterday it was revealed that a decision on the path for NGAD has been pushed to the incoming Trump administration, as you can read about here. The fate of NGAD will likely help determine B-21 numbers, especially as the Air Force has talked about the stealth bomber potentially filling in for the sixth-generation fighter jet if that were to be procured in smaller numbers. As we have discussed before, the B-21 will be much more than a long-range bomber, and having it adopt a more ‘air dominance’-type role would not be entirely unexpected. A B-21 at Northrop Grumman’s facility at the Air Force’s Plant 42 in Palmdale, California. U.S. Air Force USAF Not only are the two programs — B-21 and NGAD — already working with some degree of overlap, but they are now competing for precious funds, and a cut to one program would almost certainly influence the other. Even before the Air Force launched its review into the NGAD requirements — which is due to wrap up around the end of this year — there were discussions about B-21 fleet numbers. During a Congressional hearing back in April of this year, Gen. David Allvin, the Air Force’s Chief of Staff, declined to commit to buying more than 100 Raiders. 'It [the B-21] certainly is the future of our bomber force. … 100 is the program of record,' Allvin said at the time. 'I think we’re not going to reach that number until probably the mid-2030s and beyond.' That, of course, could change if the decision is made to accelerate production. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin. U.S. Air Force photo by Eric Dietrich Eric Dietrich At the same time, Allvin said the service was already looking to 'other technological advancements' to augment the new bombers — a likely reference to Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones. CCAs also came up during Bussiere’s talk yesterday. The AFGSC boss confirmed that the command is looking at the potential for long-range, autonomous CCAs to operate together with the B-21, but he also noted that they first want to wait and see how the concept works in relation to crewed fighters. 'We’re going to let the fighter force kind of mature that concept with [Increment] 1 … and then we’ll be prepared to integrate that into the Long Range Strike Family of Systems, probably at a later date,' Bussiere said. A model of General Atomics’ CCA design for Increment 1. Jamie Hunter 'I won’t get ahead of the Chief or the Secretary, but it’s a logical question to ask, whether long-range strike would benefit from the CCA concept,' Bussiere added. 'Right now, we don’t actually have that in the plan.' Only a day before Bussiere’s talk, another Air Force official, 8th Air Force commander Maj. Gen. Jason R. Armagost, had observed that 'a large aircraft, like a bomber, has many apertures and many radios, and in many cases, more crew members to be able to manage things like' CCAs. That may be true, but there remain questions about the degree of utility that a CCA developed primarily to operate alongside crewed fighters would be able to complement the missions flown by a long-range bomber, which are of considerably greater duration, on average. At the same time, the Increment 1 CCAs referenced by Bussiere are also primarily intended for air-to-air missions, at least at this point. With that in mind, it is somewhat baffling that there is no dedicated companion drone within the Long Range Strike Family of Systems — at least, not one that we know about. But the statements about pairing CCA with the B-21 seem to indicate that it doesn’t have a drone companion capable of tactically assisting it. This potential hurdle is something that Air Force Secretary Kendall has also referenced in the past. In fact, Kendall initially espoused the idea of having CCAs complement long-range bombers, before admitting, in 2022, that 'the idea of similar-range collaborative combat aircraft is not turning out to be cost-effective.' Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall. U.S. Air Force photo by Andy Morataya Andy Morataya While the Air Force plays a waiting game to see how best CCAs — and what type of CCAs — should collaborate with its next-generation stealth bombers, it seems certain that drone developments will also have a major role to play in shaping B-21 force size. At the very least, CCAs are now officially back on the table for AFGSC, too. It’s worth noting that, at the start of this year, Northrop Grumman disclosed a loss of nearly $1.2 billion on the B-21 program, admitting that it also expects to take a financial hit on each of the first five low-rate production lots of the bombers. However, the company still expects to make enormous revenues on the back of the program over its lifetime, even without additional orders. At the time of the Raider’s public rollout in December 2022, the overall program cost was pegged at $203 billion in Fiscal Year 2019 dollars, based on a fleet of 100 bombers, according to a report from Bloomberg. Since then, it has been reported that the cost of those first five low-rate production lots has decreased, from the $19.1 billion budgeted by the U.S. Air Force in 2023 to the $13.8 billion budgeted for 2025, according to figures published by Aviation Week — equivalent to a 28 percent discount. 'I do think in the coming months, we may get a better indication from the Air Force as to how they’re thinking about B-21 quantities in the long run,' Northrop Grumman CEO Warden added, back in October. While officials haven’t spoken openly about any changes to specific B-21 numbers, it’s certainly notable that AFGSC considers that extra production capacity is available, if needed.

Syrian Rebels Closing In On Homs, Cutting Off Damascus From Coast...	There are growing indications that the central Syrian city of Homs is close to falling as rebel forces push south from the newly seized town of Hama. Its capture would represent another stunning blow to the regime of Bashar Al-Assad, which has already lost Aleppo too during this 10-day-old operation. This would put Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS)-led fighters some 75 miles north of Damascus and all but cutting off the capital's access to the coast. The coastal region is a bastion of Assad's Alewite sect and home to Russia's two military bases in Syria. You can read more about the capture of Hama in our story about it here. HTS, the former al-Qaida-linked Al-Nusra Front, claimed on Friday that it had captured two towns six miles north of Homs, Syria’s third-largest city and a strategic gateway to the capital, Damascus, The Washington Post noted. There are also claims that those forces have reached Homs.

(Photo by Izettin Kasim/Anadolu via Getty Images) Anadolu In his first interview with international news media since launching this campaign, HTS leader Abu Mohammad al-Jolani told CNN on Friday that the goal of this drive is to reach Damascus and rid the nation of Assad. 'When we talk about objectives, the goal of the revolution remains the overthrow of this regime,' he told the network. 'It is our right to use all available means to achieve that goal.' The long-standing backing of allies Iran and Russia won't save Assad this time, al-Jolani argued. 'The seeds of the regime’s defeat have always been within it… the Iranians attempted to revive the regime, buying it time, and later the Russians also tried to prop it up,' he added. 'But the truth remains: this regime is dead.' CNN, not Al Jazeera, is the first international tv to interview the HTS leader Jolani.

The assessment mirrors much of what we mentioned in our previous piece. The rebel advance 'threatens the loss of the air strike component, which makes up 75 percent of the combat capabilities of our troops in the [Syrian Arab Republic] SAR,' the Russian Air Force-connected Fighterbomber Telegram channel bemoaned. 'The Khmeimim airfield is not a multi-story construction site with basements, it is a field with easily assembled houses on top, which will cease to function as soon as the enemy either approaches the range of artillery fire, or the range of drones,' Fighterbomber suggested. 'And here it will not be possible to use the maneuver of aviation, which saves us on the mainland.' Homs is about 50 miles east of the Russian naval base in Tartus and about 75 miles north of Damascus. (Google Earth image) Given the terrain and road systems, there is 'nowhere to withdraw,' the channel added. 'In fact, the only reserve airfields left in Syria are two airfields. This is a critical minimum. The situation with the naval base in Tartus is about the same. Of course, it is possible to defend and hold it for quite a long time, if there is someone and something, but it will either not be able to function at all, or very limitedly.' 'It is practically impossible to evacuate the bases,' Fighterbomber suggested. 'In the best case, it is possible to evacuate most of the personnel, documentation and ferry serviceable aircraft.' Russia's main task in Syria now is to hold Latakia, Fighterbomber hypothesized. Resistance to drones 'is also limited by the distance from the mainland with its supplies of missiles and air defense systems,' Fighterbomber posited. 'Therefore, the main task of our forces in Syria is to prevent the enemy from entering Latakia, even if we have to temporarily give up the rest of the territory.' The typically upbeat Kremlin regime blogger Fighterbomber seems unusually downbeat about the situation in Syria, warning that evacuating the remaining airfields and even the naval base could prove extremely challenging. pic.twitter.com/XncDMHamm2&mdash; WarTranslated (Dmitri) (@wartranslated) December 6, 2024 With the anti-Assad forces bearing down on Homs, some regime forces were reportedly seen withdrawing through Deir Atiyah, a town about halfway between Homs and Damascus along the key M-5 highway linking those two cities.

'Iran will send missiles, drones and more advisers to Syria, a senior Iranian official said on Friday,' Reuters reported. Given the state of play on the battlefield, with Iran's long-held land-routes across Syria that are used to deliver arms and personnel likely disrupted, that most likely means air flights into Damascus, which is under increasing pressure from the HTS-led forces. While those troops have reportedly captured air defense and radar systems, it is unknown if they have the know-how to endanger any aerial resupply efforts. Adding to the logistic woes, Israel has been intercepting flights from Iran over Syrian airspace, forcing them to return to Iran. So how exactly Iran will supply the increasingly physically isolated Assad regime is unclear, regardless of their intent. All this exacerbates the problem created by the Assad regime's potential loss of access to the coast, cutting off all the ports through which supplies could pass. The same is true for just supplying the country as a whole with the goods it needs.

Experimental Ballistic Missile Russia Used On Ukraine Could Be He...	Russian President Vladimir Putin has raised the possibility of forward deploying new Oreshnik ballistic missiles capable of carrying multiple warheads in neighboring Belarus in the latter half of next year. Oreshnik, which U.S. officials have said is an intermediate-range design derived from the RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), first emerged after it was used in an unprecedented attack on Ukraine last month. Putin discussed the feasibility of placing Oreshniks in Belarus during a televised ceremony today in Minsk where he signed a new mutual defense agreement with that country's leader Alexander Lukashenko. With the deal now in place, Belarus, the affairs of which have been ever more deeply intertwined with those of Russia in recent years, is firmly and openly under the protection of the latter's nuclear deterrent umbrella. Russia had already begun deploying nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory in cooperation with that country's armed forces last year. Lukashenko asked Putin to deploy Oreshnik missiles on the territory of Belarus.'I want to publicly ask you to have the new weapons systems and, above all, Oreshnik deployed on the territory of Belarus. This would calm some minds,' said the illegitimate leader of Belarus.Putin… pic.twitter.com/CCRyimMs8U&mdash; Anton Gerashchenko (@Gerashchenko_en) December 6, 2024 'Russia recently successfully launched the Oreshnik. This had a certain impact on our former partners, and now rivals. Do not consider this some kind of impudence, but I would like to publicly ask you to deploy new weapons systems, primarily the Oreshnik, on the territory of Belarus,' Lukashenko said at one point in the ceremony, per a machine translation of his remarks as reported by Russia's Interfax. 'I would very much ask you to think about it and agree to our request.' 'I think this will become possible in the second half of next year, as serial production of these systems in Russia increases and as these missile systems enter service with the Russian strategic forces,' Putin said in response, according to Reuters. 'There are a number of technical issues that must be resolved by specialists, namely, determining the minimum range taking into account the priorities of ensuring the security of the Republic of Belarus,' Putin added, per another machine translation of a report from the Kommersant newspaper in Russia. He also indicated that if Oreshniks were sent to Belarus that they would be under the control of Russian forces, but that Belarusian authorities would have a say in what targets they could be employed against. Details about Oreshnik remain limited. After its use against Ukraine in November, Putin had described it as a 'medium-range missile system' and 'a ballistic missile equipped with non-nuclear hypersonic technology' capable of reaching a peak speed of Mach 10. 'The kinetic impact is powerful, like a meteorite falling,' the Russian President more recently said.

Officials in Ukraine also later said that the warheads contained no explosives, according to Reuters. Whether these were traditional re-entry vehicles, maneuvering ones, or true hypersonic boost-glide vehicles, and what kinds of warheads (conventional or nuclear) they may be able to carry, remain unknown. Larger ballistic missiles, even ones with traditional designs, reach hypersonic speeds, typically defined as anything above Mach 5, in the terminal stage of their flight. U.S. authorities also subsequently said that Oreshnik is an intermediate-range weapon based on the RS-26, the development of which was said to have been shelved in 2018. Officially categorized as an ICBM, there have long been discussions about whether the Rubezh was actually an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) design. IRBMs and ICBMs are defined as having maximum ranges between 1,864 and 3,418 miles (3,000 to 5,500 kilometers) and greater than 3,418 miles (5,500 kilometers), respectively. You can read more about the RS-26 in detail here.

Roman Pilpey / AFP via Getty Images Putin's comments today that Oreshnik is not yet in serial production underscores that the missile remains developmental in nature and that there are only likely a very limited number available currently. The Russian President's note that Oreshnik's minimum range apparently still needs to be definitively determined is also notable. The example that struck Ukraine in November hit a target roughly 500 miles from the launch site in Kapustin Yar. As such, forward-deploying the missiles to Belarus might actually limit the ability to employ them against certain targets, such as those in Ukraine. The straight-shot distance between the far-northern end of Belarus and the Ukrainian border is only around 350 miles at most. Ukraine's capital Kyiv lies just some 56 miles from the boundary with Belarus. There has also been much discussion already about the threat Oreshnik poses to targets elsewhere in Europe, including the capitals of all NATO members in the region. This is something that Russian media has been happy to highlight, as seen below. From launch sites in Belarus, Oreshnik's minimum range could be factor in this context, as well. Belarus directly borders NATO allies Poland, Latvia, and Lithuania, and is also in relatively close proximity to another member of the alliance, Estonia. Russian media released a new graphic showing Oreshnik missile flight times to major cities in Europe pic.twitter.com/Ry7yLymK2n&mdash; Preston Stewart (@prestonstew_) November 22, 2024 Oreshniks could be fired across very high lofted trajectories to hit targets at shorter ranges, but there would still be a limit to what could be achieved in this way. Doing this could also increase the speed at which the missile and/or any payloads it releases are moving in the terminal phase, and the potentially destructive stresses on them, as well. Regardless, having Oreshniks in Belarus could also still be useful for dispersing that capability and shorter-range munitions deployed in that country, including nuclear-capable Iskander-M short-range ballistic missiles, which could still be employed against targets in closer proximity. The missile by itself presents a longer-range strategic-level threat that can be employed without crossing the nuclear threshold, something Russia has visibly demonstrated through the real-world attack on Ukraine. Whether it is also nuclear-capable is unclear. At a peak speed of at least Mach 10 (Ukrainian officials have said the missile fired at them might have actually gotten up to Mach 11), the weapon would also be flying faster than most air and missile defense systems can reliably intercept. The War Zone was quick to highlight the broader signaling to Russia's regional and global opponents behind the very public use of Oreshnik in November. Russian authorities used existing nuclear risk reduction channels to alert the United States to the launch of the missile beforehand. The New York Times reported this week that Russian Army General Staff Chief Valery Gerasimov also told U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Charles Q. Brown in a subsequent phone call that the launch had been in the works for some time. Gerasimov reportedly said the planning predated the U.S. government's decision to allow Ukrainian forces to fire Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) short-range ballistic missiles at targets inside Russia. This was also the first-ever direct call between Gerasimov and Brown, and Brown is said to have agreed to not proactively announce that it had occurred. All of this follows very public announcements by the U.S. military about its intention to send intermediate-range strike capabilities to Germany, and potentially elsewhere in Europe, in the coming years. This includes planned 'episodic deployments' of the U.S. Army's Typhon ground-based missile system, which can fire Tomahawk cruise missiles and multi-purpose SM-6 missiles, as well as that service's still-in-development Dark Eagle hypersonic missile. The U.S. Navy has also demonstrated its ability to deploy containerized launchers related to Typhon, which can be employed in a ground-base mode and also fire Tomahawks and SM-6s, to sites in Europe. A group of four trailer-based launchers and a mobile command post that make up the core of a single US Army Typhon missile system battery. US Army A full battery set of four Typhon launchers, as well as the trailer-based command post. US Army Exactly when Oreshniks might appear in Belarus and how many missiles might be deployed there remain to be seen. At the same time, the missile is already clearly emerging as a particularly important element of any discussion about the evolving geopolitical environment in Europe and potentially beyond.

USS Carney’s Red Sea Operations Highlight 5-inch Deck Gun’s Anti-...	As U.S. Navy destroyers continue to shoot down Iran-backed Houthi militant drone and missile barrages in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, a new Navy recounting of the first of those engagements, which involved the USS Carney (DDG-64), highlights a seldom discussed secondary application for the ship's Mark 45 5-inch main deck gun — shooting down aerial threats. On Oct. 19, 2023, Carney became the first ship to take out a Houthi missile and drone barrage fired from Yemen following Israel's invasion of Gaza. It was the initial salvo in an ongoing fight that Navy leaders have deemed the most sustained and kinetic action the force has seen since World War II. Details have been previously reported regarding that incident and the missiles used, and other incidents have involved Navy ships leaning on their pricey missiles and even their last-resort, close-in weapon system (CIWS) to stop Houthi barrages during the past 14 months. But little has been said about destroyers using their Mark 45 five-inch main gun during such encounters, a gun normally leveled surface and shore targets. The Carney details released this week are admittedly short on specifics, but they feature personal insights from the sailors who were on the maritime front lines that day. The USS Carney (DDG 64). (U.S. Navy) USS Carney underway. (U.S. Navy photo by Journalist Seaman Apprentice Charles A. Ordoqui 'We were in berthing and heard [an announcement over the ship’s 1MC intercom system] ‘clear the weatherdecks,’ and I remember thinking, ‘what does that mean? I’ve never heard that before,’' Fire Controlman (AEGIS) 2nd Class Justin Parker, a SPY-1 radar technician, said in the Navy release. Parker then recalled hearing missiles and Carney's 5-inch gun being fired. 'We had never done anything like this before – we had only trained to it,' Gunner’s Mate 1st Class Charles Currie, a technician of the Mark 45 five-inch gun, is quoted as saying. 'There was a lot of adrenaline going on – this was real-world now.' All told, Carney spent 10 hours shooting down 15 Houthi drones and four land-attack cruise missiles that day, the first of 51 combat engagements the warship would rack up before arriving back home to Mayport, Florida, in May. Their actions earned the entire crew the Combat Action Ribbon, a distinction that hadn’t been given to an entire ships force since the Gulf War. Navy officials declined to clarify to TWZ what type of rounds were fired by its main gun, what they were targeting or exactly how the main deck gun was employed. Available ammunition types for the gun have included various high-explosive rounds, including proximity-fuzed air-bursting ones, and canister rounds packed with metal balls. BAE, the gun’s manufacturer, says its latest Mod 4 version can accommodate 20 conventional, semi-fixed rounds, 10 extended-length projectiles or a mixture of both in its 20-round loader drum. The ship’s entire magazine houses 600 rounds in reserve as well. Seventy-pound shells for a U.S. Navy destroyer's 5-inch main gun. (U.S. Navy) Some retired surface warfare officers say Carney’s five-inch gun was a prime tool for taking out some of the Houthi onslaught without expending precious stocks of costly Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles, RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missiles (for those ships that have it) or SM-2 missiles. USNI News reported that SM-2s were used to take out the Houthi missiles in that initial October 2023 fight, but such missiles cost millions per unit, and concerns started being raised about the rate of expenditure for such munitions just a few months after that first Carney battle. By the spring of 2024, such clashes had become a near-daily occurrence. And while we don’t yet know what kind of rounds Carney’s gun was firing that day, the Mk 45 mounted on the ship, which has a 13-nautical mile range when firing standard ammo, is capable of taking out a slower-moving aerial target like a Houthi drone. 'A (five-inch) gun can put rounds in the air, which with fragmentation can be effective air defense,' said Bradley Martin, a retired surface warfare officer and current analyst with the RAND think tank. 'Against an (anti-ship cruise missile), not so much.' Among the possible reasons for firing the gun, Carney’s leaders might have determined via flight characteristics that the Houthi ordnance were 'good gun targets' that didn’t require expending costly missiles, according to Jan van Tol, a retired destroyer and amphibious assault ship captain. 'I would be a fan of that kind of approach, i.e., do not always fire at max range with your longest-range weapon, both due to high [financial cost] and having only a limited magazine of them,' van Tol, now a senior fellow with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, told TWZ this week.

Formidable Shield is designed to improve allied interoperability in a live-fire integrated air and missile defense environment, using NATO command and control reporting structures. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Fred Gray IV/Released) MC1 Fred Gray IV Letting a hostile drone get close enough to the ship, where the gun could be employed, could also be the result of a saturated air defense environment, where other capabilities have to be left in reserve for other threats that are being engaged or could appear at any time. The target could have also presented itself only when it was within the deck gun's range. TWZ has previously showcased what the Mk 45 brings to the fight and how they fire 16 to 20 rounds per minute. Such a deck gun is also believed to have helped a Greek warship take out a Houthi drone off Somalia in July. Go here to read more about that incident. The Mark 45 is directed via the ship’s combat systems, including the powerful, 'Wall-E'-looking Mark 20 Electro-Optical Sensor System (EOSS), a critical and highly flexible system that you can read more about here. Representatives from L3Harris, the system’s manufacturer, clued TWZ in on what makes EOSS so unique during a 2019 interview: 'The primary purpose of the system is to provide highly accurate targeting information to the ship’s gun weapon system. In many instances, the ship’s radar may make an initial detection of a potential threat, and the Mk20 is then cued to visually confirm the target, and provide precise range and position for gun engagement. The goal is first shot hit accuracy. Of course, sailors are quite creative and immediately recognize the Mk20’s excellent performance as a situational awareness and navigation aid. We have heard of crews using the Mk20 to visually investigate suspicious vessels, and help navigate through congested waters. The operators find the thermal imaging capability and resolution particularly useful in nighttime operations.' The Mark 20 Electro-Optical Sensor System (EOSS). (TWZ.com) Some Navy efforts that got canceled in recent years would arguably have bolstered the five-inch gun’s capabilities for the Houthi fight, conserving precious missiles in the process. A program that envisioned loading five-inch guns with the speedy and versatile Hyper-Velocity Projectile (HVP) was scuttled in 2021, TWZ reported, but not before the Navy test-fired the rounds during 2018’s Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise. Red Sea observers and missile conservationists might be rueing that decision these days. Options like the HVP were seen as a more cost-effective and magazine-expanding way to take out a variety of threats, naval analyst and retired submarine officer Bryan Clark told USNI News in 2019. 'So if you think about the kinds of threats you might face in the Middle East, the lower-end cruise missiles or a larger UAV, now you have a way to shoot them down that doesn’t require you use a $2 million ESSM or $1 million RAM because a hyper velocity projectile – even in the highest-end estimates have it in the $75,000 to $100,000 range, and that’s for the fanciest version of it with an onboard seeker,' Clark told USNI News’ Sam Lagrone. While the combat effectiveness of the Carney and the destroyers that have succeeded it in the Red Sea fight is undeniable, we don’t yet know the full extent of the role the humble five-inch gun has played in these battles, or whether the Navy is once again considering giving their magazines some extra punch.

The Is The New ‘Counter-Drone Strategy’ Just Unveiled By Pentagon	The Pentagon has released a summary of a new classified strategy to guide efforts to protect American forces abroad and across the U.S. homeland from growing drone threats. This comes as the dangers posed by uncrewed aerial systems have become a national cause celebre due to a number of high-profile incidents. This includes still-unexplained drone incursions over Langley Air Force Base in Virginia last year, as well as more recent incidents in New Jersey and over multiple U.S. facilities in the United Kingdom, all of which The War Zone was first to report on. The new counter-drone strategy is said to build upon a number of existing efforts, including the establishment of the Joint Counter-small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Office (JCO) in 2020. It is also set to tie into a new Pentagon initiative to help speed up the acquisition and fielding of new counter-drone capabilities dubbed Replicator 2. The first Replicator effort has been focused on getting more uncrewed systems into the hands of U.S. warfighters. In addition, the heads of U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) and U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) have been given new synchronizer roles to help coordinate counter-drone preparedness (including the training and equipping of relevant forces) and actual responses to incidents. Counter-drone systems on display at the Falcon Peak 2025 demonstration event earlier this year. DOD 'Enabled by growing commercial innovation and the increasing sophistication of artificial intelligence (AI), autonomy, and networking technology, unmanned systems are fundamentally changing how militaries of all sizes, capacities, and capabilities – as well as non-state actors – achieve their objectives,' the fact sheet on the new counter-drone strategy explains. 'From the Middle East to Ukraine and across the globe – including in the U.S. homeland – unmanned systems are reshaping tactics, techniques, and procedures; challenging established operational principles; and condensing military innovation cycles.' 'At the operational level, these systems are making it more difficult for forces to hide, concentrate, communicate, and maneuver. They allow adversaries to more easily surveil, disrupt, or attack our forces, assets, and installations, potentially without attribution. At the strategic level, unmanned systems provide aggressors with the ability to reduce the initial human, financial, and reputational costs of conflict. The relatively low-cost, widely available nature of these systems has, in effect, democratized precision strike.' These are all points The War Zone has been highlighting for years. In February, we published a feature specifically on how AI looks set to enable major new evolution, if not revolution in lower-end uncrewed aerial capabilities. A Ukrainian drone, with its operator seen in the foreground, drops a payload during training. The heavy use of drones, including weaponized types, on both sides of the conflict in Ukraine has driven help fully drive the threats posed by uncrewed aerial systems into the public consciousness. Scott Peterson/Getty Images 'The Department is mitigating the potential negative effects of unmanned systems on U.S. forces, assets, and installations – at home and abroad. A critical portion of our efforts, particularly in the near-term, comes from improving our defenses, with an emphasis on detection as well as active and passive defenses,' the fact sheet continues. 'The Department will ensure our forces and priority installations have protection. To stay ahead of advances in unmanned systems – and their growing prevalence – the Department will prepare for more advanced challenges, pacing our future capabilities to more stressing cases (e.g., larger numbers of increasingly capable and autonomous systems). Over the mid- and long-term, the Department will also develop and design our future force to reduce their vulnerability and increase their resilience to these threats. Taken together, these approaches will allow the Department to maintain our advances and our ability to fight and win our Nation’s wars, if called upon.' To this end, the fact sheet lays out five specific 'strategic ways' that are central to how the Pentagon will seek to address drone threats through its new strategy, which are as follows: 'Deepen our Understanding and Awareness of Unmanned Systems Trends and Threats. The Department will 'sense and make sense' of threats that unmanned systems pose, including by gaining a greater understanding of unmanned systems threats and by improving the ability of our operational forces to detect, track, and characterize these threats.' 'Disrupt & Degrade Unmanned Systems Threat Networks. The Department will address the threat networks that drive the development and proliferation of unmanned systems whenever possible, including by launching and executing deliberate campaigns to counter these networks, in partnership with other U.S. departments and agencies.' 'Defend Against Unmanned Systems Threats to U.S. Interests. The Department will adapt fully to defending against unmanned systems as a core element of warfighting, including by: improving our active and passive defenses; clarifying, streamlining, and delegating authorities, as needed; and institutionalizing approaches across doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership, personnel, facilities, and policy.' 'Deliver Solutions with Greater Speed, Adaptability, and Scale. The Department will deliver robust counter-unmanned systems at speed and scale, including by leveraging rapid acquisition approaches; prioritizing integrated, open, modular solutions; employing systems engineering and predictive analytics; reducing the cost imbalance between unmanned systems and countermeasures; expanded budget agility; increasing experimentation; creating conditions for rapid and realistic testing; and maximizing exportability, co-development, and co-production of capabilities with our closest allies and partners.' 'Develop & Design the Future Joint Force for Unmanned Systems-Driven Ways of War. The Department will make countering unmanned systems a key element of our thinking about future force development and design, including by pursuing changes to our force structure, employing our forces differently, and seeking technologies that could enable us to offset adversary advantages.' The full fact sheet can be seen below. DOD 'I think the real sort of emphasis of the strategy is to say, you know, as we're taking on the effect of unmanned systems, we need to think about this temporally,' a senior U.S. official told The War Zone and a small group of other media outlets ahead of today's announcement. 'So, in the near term, a lot of what we're doing is improving our defenses.' 'As we think about more advanced challenges, as we think about the more stressing cases we could face, we also are thinking in a strategy perspective of making sure that we're developing and designing our future forces to reduce vulnerabilities and increase resilience to threats,' they added. 'When we think about how we defend against this&#8230; it's really a layered defense with a variety of sensing - everything from RF to active and passive radars,' another senior U.S. official said during today's press call when asked for more details about existing counter-drone capabilities and future plans. 'And then &#8230; there's a variety of defeat systems, kinetic and non-kinetic.' 'When we talk about this threat, you have to consider &#8230; the size of the threat. A small UAS [uncrewed aerial system] is a little bit different threat than the larger UAS threats that you tend to see going on with events in Ukraine and Israel,' they added. 'So there's a different set of options that you have to have, but we are looking at the span of everything from non-kenetic to kinetic to new capabilities such as directed energy.' The senior U.S. official specifically highlighted Raytheon's Coyote, Anduril's Roadrunner, and systems that use BAE System's laser-guided 70mm Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II (APKWS) rockets as effectors as examples of current kinetic counter-drone capabilities. They also mentioned work to better optimize other existing weapon systems, such as radar-guided Hellfire missiles and traditional surface-to-air interceptors, for use against uncrewed aerial systems. Multiple branches of the U.S. military are known to be actively developing and working to field laser and high-power microwave-directed energy weapons as additional options for physically destroying drone threats. Non-kinetic defeat capabilities primarily consist of various electronic warfare systems. That individual also acknowledged that the counter-drone capabilities that can be employed in a conflict zone are very different from the ones that would be usable, at least under current authorities, domestically within the United States. The aforementioned drone incidents in the United Kingdom have highlighted how similar rules and regulations are at play when it comes to domestic drone defense in other countries. At a counter-drone demonstration event called Falcon Peak 2025 in October, U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) Deputy Test Director Jason Mayes explicitly told The War Zone and others that kinetic and directed energy capabilities are not currently on the table for defending military bases and other critical infrastructure within the U.S. homeland. A mix of often convoluted legal, regulatory, and other challenges are central to all of this, as you can read more about here. A system designed to detect drones via the radiofrequency signals they put out and hijack the control link between them and their operators on display at Falcon Peak 2025. Howard Altman 'The homeland is a very different environment in that we have a lot of hobbyist drones here that are no threat at all, that are sort of congesting the environment. At the same time, we have, from a statutory perspective and from an intelligence perspective, quite rightly, [a] more constrained environment in terms of our ability to act,' a third senior U.S. official on today's call elaborated. 'When we think about the [new counter-drone] strategy, &#8230; it's really trying to make sure that we are making a conscious effort to mitigate the threat in the homeland today, and the unique ways in which it manifests in the homeland, but also looking forward in time.' 'And so, we're doing things like making sure that our people have the right training. So it's not just about the equipment, but it's about are we organizing and training the way that we need to ensure that our commanders on the ground understand how to make a great risk calculus in the homeland for the unique risks that we have here,' they continued. 'We have a lot of installations that are in &#8230; areas where we have to be very careful about collateral effects. And do we have the organization that we need to be able to rapidly respond, given the capabilities that we're building today and [that] we'll continue to build to meet the threat of all for the future?' That official used the drone incursions over Langley Air Force Base last year as a specific of what the new counter-drone strategy, as well as NORTHCOM's new synchronizer role, are meant to address. An F-22 Raptor stealth fighter under a shelter on the flightline at Langley Air Force Base. USAF 'What we had before this was &#8230; a not necessarily in the operational chain ability to talk to each other, to find out who had what systems that might be able to be brought to bear,' they explained. 'And so I think that would be a huge &#8230; new organizational ability to be able to drive action.' 'As time moves on, we will have more standardized, coordinated education and training so that commanders will all have a baseline knowledge of what their authorities are and how they're able to engage,' they added. 'It's also going to mean that for facilities that may not currently be covered by 130(i), but are eligible, that we're going to have somebody who's really looking to make sure everyone's getting covered.' '130(i)' here refers to that subsection of Title 10 of the U.S. Code (10 USC 130i), which covers current authorities for the 'protection of certain facilities and assets from unmanned aircraft,' including through the use of kinetic and non-kinetic capabilities. It contains a number of specific stipulations and where and when those authorities can actually be employed, which you can read more about here. A full list of the kinds of 'action' authorized under 10 USC 130i. Cornell Law School The strategy notably does not explicitly call for an expansion to 130(i) or ask for any other new authorities. Members of Congress have been separately pushing to expand the authorities available to the U.S. military and other government agencies to tackle drone threats, particularly within the U.S. homeland. 'I think our view is that we are using those authorities to their fullest, but we're working to improve the collaboration that we have with our interagency partners,' one of the senior U.S. officials said today. 'That's an important part of how those authorities are [employed].' In the U.S. homeland context, even incidents that occur in relatively confined areas can easily span multiple federal, state, local, and other law enforcement jurisdictions outside of the purview of the Department of Defense. There is also the potential for an international component, especially in instances that involve the U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). As the recent incidents in the United Kingdom have underscored, drone threats to U.S. interests that are removed from traditional war zones exist well outside of the confines of the homeland, as well. A stock picture of a 'No Drone Zone' sign and other warnings along the perimeter of RAF Lakenheath, one of the bases in the United Kingdom that hosts U.S. forces and was recently the site of still unexplained drone incursions. Mark Kerrison/In Pictures via Getty Images Altogether, the new counter-drone strategy the Pentagon has rolled out today is an important acknowledgment of the growing uncrewed aerial threat ecosystem, especially as it exists outside of conflict zones. It lays out equally important steps forward for addressing these issues. At the same time, drone threats, including to the U.S. homeland, are not new and this is not the first time the U.S. government has laid new policies and/or broad strategies for addressing them. It is particularly glaring that the U.S. military is apparently taking key steps just now to better coordinate action within existing authorities. This is all despite years of increasingly worrisome incidents in and around the United States, many of which The War Zone has been the first to report on. As we have pointed out repeatedly in the past, the U.S. military was long slow on the uptake and continues to very much play catchup when it comes to addressing the growing threats posed by drones even on traditional battlefields.

Final Decision On Next Generation Air Dominance Fighter Punted To...	A decision on the future of the U.S. Air Force’s high-stakes Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative, which includes its crewed sixth-generation stealth combat jet, has been pushed to the incoming Trump administration. The move comes amid uncertainty about the Air Force’s ability to pay for NGAD, with a list of priority programs competing for funds, as well as its relevance in a future high-end combat scenario and who will be selected to build it, if it moves forward. Lockheed and Boeing are the two contractors still competing for the contract. In a statement today, the Air Force said: 'The Secretary of the Air Force will defer the Next Generation Air Dominance way-ahead decision to the next administration, while the Department of the Air Force continues its analysis and executes the necessary actions to ensure decision space remains intact for the NGAD program.' NGAD has been one of Kendall's major initiatives and his work prior to becoming secretary on a secret program that resulted in a flying demonstrator for what would morph into NGAD was key in moving the program forward. Inbox: USAF punts the NGAD decision to the next administration: as it 'continues its analysis and executes the necessary actions to ensure decision space remains intact for the NGAD program.'&mdash; Brian Everstine (@beverstine) December 5, 2024 The Air Force added that it is extending the current contracts for NGAD to 'further mature designs/systems while ensuring the industry teams remain intact.' The service requests that the industry competitors 'update their proposals to account for the delays resulting from the current pause (schedule/milestone update only).' As noted earlier, Boeing and Lockheed Martin are competing for the contract to build the NGAD combat jet, but neither company has formally confirmed that. On the other hand, Northrop Grumman announced it had dropped out of the running voluntarily last year. The Air Force has said in the past that it hopes to begin fielding these new 6th generation stealth fighters before 2030. Only last month, Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall had questioned the affordability of the service’s big-ticket aircraft programs, which as well as new crewed fighters include advanced aerial refueling tankers and highly autonomous Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones that are both linked directly to NGAD. Yet the crushing cost of rebuilding the USAF ICBM force is perhaps the largest driving financial factor that is impacting NGAD and other high-ticket programs. A rendering of a notional crewed sixth-generation stealth combat jet. Collins Aerospace In advance of today’s decision, the Air Force was already conducting a deep review of its NGAD plans, due to be completed before the end of the year, although Kendall has so far been keen to emphasize that the future of the sixth-generation fighter is secure, with the focus now being on how next generation tankers, CCAs and different NGAD fighters designs can best be used together, and in what kind of mix. 'We are actually looking hard at the combination of the Next Generation Air Dominance platform, the Increment Two uncrewed Collaborative Combat Aircraft, and the Next Generation Aerial Refueling System, all in an Agile Combat Employment context,' Kendall said back in November. 'Right now, given our commitments, our resources, and strategic priorities, it’s hard for me to see how we can afford any combination of those new designs,' Kendall added. Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall. U.S. Air Force photo by Andy Morataya Andy Morataya With cost being the prime concern behind the current NGAD review, it’s likely to again be at the forefront when the Trump administration determines the future of the program. Previously, it was assessed that each of NGAD’s sixth-generation crewed fighters would cost in the region of $300 million or more. Since then, however, Kendall has said he wants that to be reduced by two-thirds, bringing it more in line with a fifth-generation F-35 stealth fighter. It’s unclear how such a dramatic price drop could be achieved, but options might include reducing the number of missions the fighter takes on, as TWZ has discussed in the past. There are potentially more radical alternatives, as well. Earlier this year, an artificial intelligence-generated rendering of a notional light stealth fighter was included in a briefing by Chief of Staff of the Air Force Gen. David Allvin, the service’s top officer, something that was billed at the time as a thought exercise. An artificial intelligence-generated rendering of a notional light stealth fighter, shown during a presentation at the Global Air and Space Chiefs Conference earlier this year. YouTube screencap Allvin has since spoken about the possibility of the possibility of the B-21 Raider stealth bomber taking on something closer to an ‘air dominance’ role depending on the outcome of the NGAD combat jet review. This is a possibility TWZ has been discussing for years and the two programs — B-21 and NGAD — are already working loosely within each other's orbits. Then there is the option of tilting the NGAD program more in favor of uncrewed assets, chiefly the Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA), for which the NGAD fighter is expected to serve as a ‘quarterback.’ While far from clear how the CCAs will operate within the broader NGAD architecture, there are also questions about how many of the drones the Air Force plans to buy. Initially, the service said it wanted as many as 1,000 of those drones, and potentially more. Recently, the Air Force has talked about more modest numbers, broken down by increments, with Kendall saying that Increment 1 would involve around '100 [aircraft] on order or delivered' by the end of the decade. A model of Anduril’s Fury design, which it is now developing under Increment 1 of the CCA program. Jamie Hunter How many more drones will eventually be acquired under subsequent remains unknown, but this is something that will also be closely tied to the future of the crewed fighter component. Around 200 NGAD fighters were originally said to have been the target force size. At one point, NGAD’s status might have looked all but bulletproof, but developments in recent months have, for the first time, raised the very real prospect of the fighter component, at least, being significantly cut back or even canceled altogether. Once key player in the incoming Trump administration has already lambasted manned fighters as yesterday's weapon. Elon Musk, who has been a strong proponent of advanced uncrewed air combat systems, reently lambasted the F-35. It is unlikely he would support an even more ambitious fighter program. And although he is not formally put in a place to make such decisions, he certainly has the President's ear on all matters. Ultimately, it’s far from unprecedented that the future of a major defense program like NGAD will be pushed from one outgoing administration to an incoming one. At the same time, it’s been clear for a while now that the Air Force will have to make some very tough decisions about its priority programs as it continues to wrestle with fiscal realities.

Anti-Assad Forces’ Capture Of Strategic Hama A Critical Stop On R...	In the latest major development in the conflict in Syria, anti-regime rebels have taken control of the key central city of Hama. The city was seized despite a major regime counteroffensive and after 'fierce battles' between Assad's forces and rebels in northern Hama province. These were accompanied by 'joint Syrian-Russian' airstrikes, according to Syria’s state news agency Sana. In only a week, the rebels have taken huge swaths of territory in the northeast, leaving real questions about the future of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. His rule has previously been shored up by Russia, which is now very much concerned with the war in Ukraine, while further support has come from Iran and its top proxy, Hezbollah, which has been deeply degraded after a months-long direct fight with Israel. This equates to a vastly different set of circumstances for Assad than in the past, with external military resources being far more limited than they were the mid-to-late 2010s. The head of the Islamist rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, today published a video declaring that Hama had been captured. 'This victory will be without revenge and merciful,' al-Jolani said, in a message to the people of the city.

Videos posted to social media suggested that the insurgents had captured the military air base on the outskirts of Hama. Footage shows several MiG-23 Flogger fighters and a long-inactive Il-28 Beagle bomber.

Hundreds of prisoners were release from the Hama Central Prison by HTS-led rebel forces.&mdash; NOELREPORTS (@noelreports.com) 2024-12-05T14:00:27.734Z Initially, the Syrian Ministry of Defense claimed that its defensive lines around Hama were 'impregnable.' However, as of yesterday, the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) information office confirmed that rebels had encircled Hama 'from three sides.' The government forces’ hold on the city was already looking flimsy, despite having launched a counteroffensive to retain control there. The SOHR added that the rebels had advanced to 'a distance of three to four kilometers' (1.9 to 2.5 miles) from the city by Wednesday. The result was that Syrian government forces were 'left with only one exit towards Homs to the south.'

These included 'dozens of trucks' loaded with tanks, weapons, ammunition, and soldiers. Meanwhile, 'regime forces and pro-government fighters led by Russian and Iranian officers' repelled an attack northwest of Hama. Finally, as rebels got closer to the city center, the Syrian Army admitted it had withdrawn, redeploying its forces 'to preserve the lives of civilians and not to involve the people of Hama city in these battles.'

In that year, there was a major anti-Assad uprising in the city, followed by fierce battles in which the opposition fighters were eventually defeated by regime forces. It is also the second major city to fall to the rebels since they launched their latest offensive, after Aleppo, Syria’s second biggest population center. At the same time, Hama is in a highly strategic location, a stronghold from which Assad’s forces are better able to defend the capital, Damascus, located to the south. Hama is situated on the main highway that runs down the western side of Syria toward the capital. A rebel-operated tank moves toward Hama city center, in Hama, Syria on December 4, 2024. Photo by Kasim Rammah/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu If the rebels can retain control of Hama, and cut west towards the coast, this threatens to cut off the main Russian bases in Syria — Khmeimim Air Base in Latakia and the sprawling naval facility in the port of Tartus — from the rest of the country. Were that to happen, it would seriously compromise Russia’s ability to support Assad militarily, as well as deprive it of its only such facilities in the Mediterranean. This is a possibility that TWZ has also recently explored. On the other hand, there are questions about the ability of the rebels to hold onto the territory that they have very rapidly taken and a race to Damascus may be their top objective. There have been reports from Syrian state mesia that the rebels are already using drones to attack targets in Damascus, including the Republican Palace, an Assad residence. HTS-led rebel forces are advancing through the desert in the countryside of Aleppo towards Hama.&mdash; NOELREPORTS (@noelreports.com) 2024-12-04T11:51:49.274Z Despite a reputation for being well organized, the speed of the advance means that HTS forces are being spread more thinly, leaving them more vulnerable to regime counterattacks. Beyond that, there is the question of the degree to which HTS will be able to reliably govern territory in its hands, especially over the longer term. Over and above this, there are broader questions about how other key strategic players will respond to the latest developments. As noted earlier, Assad’s grip on power has been reinforced heavily by Russia and Iran — including via the latter’s proxy, Hezbollah. Moscow, of course, is very much preoccupied with the conflict in Ukraine. Already, Russia is not able to offer Syria anywhere near the same kind of air support that it did earlier in the conflict, which it joined in 2015. The capacity to provide persistent airpower was a critical factor in turning the tide of the conflict in Assad's favor. A Russian Su-24M Fencer strike aircraft prepares to take off from Khmeimim Air Base in Latakia. Russian Ministry of Defense For its part, Hezbollah has been seriously degraded by Israeli actions in Lebanon, although Iran still has more capacity to bolster the Assad regime. But even Iran is in a more precarious position as it needs to stabilize Hezbollah while also providing for the Houthis' anti-ship campaign in and around the Red Sea. Meanwhile, Turkey, which has backed the anti-Assad opposition, also has a major stake in what happens next, with its primary aim being to bring down the Kurdish Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria, controlled by an offshoot of Ankara’s sworn enemy, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). Moscow says that it is in 'close contact' with both Ankara and Tehran over the conflict in Syria. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, added that Moscow was 'closely monitoring', events in Syria. 'Depending on the assessment of the situation, we will be able to talk about the degree of assistance that is needed by the Syrian authorities to cope with the militants and eliminate this threat,' he said.

The fall of Aleppo four days ago was especially dramatic, as it had never been entirely out of government control since the start of the civil war. Since then, however, there have been reports of much tougher fighting, with the regime forces putting up particularly tough resistance around Hama.

Clearly, this gesture wasn’t enough, but it is a measure of the desperation of the regime and a suggestion that, for the first time in years, Assad’s grip on power across Syria might be slipping.

Revised Fold-Away Rotor Aircraft Concepts Emerge From Special Ope...	Bell has released a rendering showing updated design concepts for vertical takeoff and landing-capable crewed and uncrewed aircraft that feature proprotors that fold away during cruise. The company is working toward building a flying demonstrator using this technology as part of a program intended to present options for a potential future high-speed, runway-independent special operations airlifter. The new rendering accompanied an announcement from Bell yesterday about the completion of wind tunnel testing in support of its work under the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Speed and Runway Independent Technology (SPRINT) program. Bell is one of two companies currently working on designs as part of Phase 1B of SPRINT, the other being Aurora Flight Sciences, a Boeing subsidiary. Aurora's SPRINT concept uses multiple internally mounted lift fans for vertical flight, as you can read more about here. A wind tunnel model of one of Bell's fold-away rotor design concepts. Bell The wind tunnel 'test phase follows successful evaluation of the Stop/Fold rotor system using the Holloman High Speed Test Track (HHSTT) in New Mexico in 2023,' according to a Bell press release. 'Building upon the previous folding rotor testing, the wind tunnel program validated the stability and control of the aircraft through the rotor fold and unfold sequence in flight. Together, these two critical risk reduction tests prove the concept is ready to move ahead into a flight demonstration as part of the DARPA SPRINT program.' Bell first released renderings of two crewed design concepts, as well as an uncrewed one, featuring what it is now calling the 'Stop/Fold rotor system' back in 2021 in relation to U.S. Special Operations Command's High-Speed Vertical Take-Off and Landing (HSVTOL) project. SPRINT is directly tied to HSTVOL, which is focused primarily on meeting certain future U.S. Air Force special operations aviation requirements. Bell released this rendering showing design concept with fold-away rotor blades in 2021. Bell At its most basic, the Stop/Fold concept is intended to offer vertical takeoff and landing capability, as well as the ability to hover, but with a tilting rotor system that can be stowed in a lower-drag configuration to allow for higher-speed level flight. A separate traditional jet propulsion system provides forward thrust in the latter mode. For comparison, the V-22 Osprey, which Bell developed together with Boeing, has very large and draggy wingtip proprotors that are used for vertical and forward flight. The V-22 is part of a long history at Bell of work on tilting rotor concepts, which also now includes the V-280 Valor and the Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) for the U.S. Army that is derived from it. FLRAA is set to replace a significant portion of the Army's Black Hawk-series helicopters. The new Bell SPRINT rendering offers updated looks at the larger of the two crewed Stop/Fold rotor concepts and the uncrewed design. The smaller crewed design concept is not shown. When it comes to the uncrewed design concept, the latest Bell render shows a significant redesign of the side-mounted air intakes. There are two new two top-mounted intakes, which could provide valuable additional airflow while in the vertical flight mode or in other low-speed flight regimes. The overall shape of the central fuselage has been streamlined, as have the wingtip rotor pods. A close-up look at the new rendering of the uncrewed stop/fold rotor design concept. Bell A look at the older uncrewed fold-away rotor design concept from 2021. Bell The crewed design concepts shows signs of similar streamlining in the shape of its fuselage and wingtip rotor pods. The fairings over the proprotor hubs have notably grown in size. A top-mounted air intake seen in previous renders is now missing, suggesting there could be a new flush intake on top instead. The crewed design concept seen in the newest Bell render. Bell A render of the larger of the two crewed design concepts with fold-away rotors that was previously released. Bell Bell's latest SPRINT press release does not include any new details about expected flight performance or other capabilities of any of the Stop/Fold rotor concepts. In the past, the company has said the technology could be scaled to designs with gross weights anywhere from 4,000 to 100,000 pounds, and offer top speeds in the level flight mode of up to 400 knots. For comparison, Air Force Special Operations Command's (AFSOC) CV-22B version of the Osprey has a stated maximum gross weight of 60,500 pounds and a top speed of 280 knots. You can read more about what Bell has previously disclosed about the fold-away rotor concept in this War Zone feature. Air Force Special Operations Command CV-22 Ospreys. USAF U.S. Air Force CV-22B Ospreys. USAF Previous renderings have also pointed to the potential for Stop/Fold rotor designs to be used for mission sets well beyond special operations airlift. This could include combat search and rescue (CSAR), intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), air-to-air combat, and air-to-surface strike. An older rendering from Bell showing vertical takeoff and landing capable drones with fold-away rotor systems armed with compact air-to-air missiles. Bell Whether or not any of Bell's Stop/Fold rotor designs become a reality remains to be seen. Tiltrotor designs, in general, are complex and present considerable challenges even before fold-way rotors are added to the mix, as has been evidenced by continued troubles with the V-22. At the same time, Bell has made significant advances in relevant technologies, as demonstrated by the V-280. There is also no guarantee that any design that emerges from SPRINT or HSVTOL will enter operational service. As The War Zone has explored in great depth in the past, the U.S. special operations community has been at least exploring new vertical takeoff and landing capable transport aircraft and related designs for decades now without fielding any of them that we know of. 'There’s a lot of hard things,' Air Force Lt. Gen. Conley, head of AFSOC, said back in October while speaking broadly about ongoing work on SPRINT and HSVTOL. 'Some of it’s just the technological pieces of the engines and trying to get enough lift and enough size.' 'I think, conceptually as an Air Force, we struggle a little bit with how big is big enough … as you look at the developmental models, some of them are, you know, the size of a sedan. And then… another iteration would be the size of about a UH-60 [Black Hawk helicopter]. And then you get up to a little bigger … probably C-130 ‘lite,'' he added at the time. 'And I think as an Air Force that’s used to move in a lot of big things, and a lot of people, and a lot of pallets, and big amounts of cargo, there’s a little bit of a mental block there.' At the same time, there is a clear and growing interest in new runway-independent capabilities across the U.S. military. Runway-independent aircraft, or at least ones with more limited runway requirements, crewed and/or uncrewed, are increasingly seen as particularly key to success in a potential future high-end conflict against China in the Pacific. The designs being explored now under SPRINT offer attributes that could also have broader applicability in operations elsewhere globally. A rendering Aurora Flight Sciences released in October showing a fan-in-wing vertical take-off-and-landing capable transport aircraft based on technology it is developing under SPRINT. Aurora Flight Sciences 'I think the high speed/range, high-speed kind of lower profile ability to get in and out of places that don’t require long runways, I think that would be attractive to any combatant commander,' AFSOC's Conley had said in October. 'It’s certainly a capability we need in the Indo-Pacific, just because of the geography, regardless of an [specific] adversary.' Large established air bases would also be top targets for an opponent in any future major conflict, which could further limit access to traditional runways. There is a significant debate ongoing now about how and where the U.S. military should invest in new hardened infrastructure and other defenses to shield critical bases from attack going forward, as you can read more about here. Being able to operate from more locations, including far-flung ones closer to active combat areas, would help reduce vulnerability and increase overall flexibility, as well. Bell is certainly continuing to move forward with work on its Stop/Fold rotor system as one option for meeting growing demands for new vertical take-off and landing-capable special operations airlift and other runway-independent capabilities.

Russia Massing For Possible Cross-River Offensive In South Ukrain...	As Ukraine continues to lose territory in the eastern region of its country and struggles to hold on to the salient it’s carved out in Russia’s Kursk Oblast, it is facing increasing pressure in the south. 'Russian troops are constantly conducting assaults in the Kherson direction,' Vladislav Voloshin, a spokesman for Ukraine’s Southern Command, told the Suspline media outlet on Wednesday. 'Over the past day, there were seven of them. They tried to gain a foothold in the [Dnipro River] island zone.' BREAKING Russian forces prepare a massive river crossing near my hometown #Kherson, amassing 300 boats in a desperate bid to secure a foothold on strategic islands. Despite suffering heavy losses in repeated assaults, they persist. Intelligence warns of storm group training… pic.twitter.com/zKyzwiJDMV&mdash; Iuliia Mendel (@IuliiaMendel) December 4, 2024 Russia is increasing its efforts on the Dnipro to draw Ukrainian troops from other regions, the spokesman suggested. 'They have the goal of capturing a certain bridgehead, holding it, and bringing them there as much of our strength and means as possible,' Voloshin said. 'Russia wants to launch another offensive here,' Oleksandr Prokudin, head of the Kherson regional military administration, told the Financial Times. Russian forces, he added, had assembled '300 boats to cross the river' for that effort. The control map of the region has remained largely unchanged since Ukrainian forces recaptured Kherson City in November 2022. Ukraine has mounted furtive attempts at establishing a bridgehead in Kyrynky on the Russian side of the river. It has also tried to advance east from the mouth of the Dnipro by attacking through the Kinburn Spit. However, neither of these attempts succeeded and this part of the battlefield has seen no real territorial gains by either side. Ukraine's attacks across the Dnipro River have been bloody and futile. (Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky) Ahead of any potential river crossing, Russia has been softening the Ukrainian side with a massive drone barrage, according to the Financial Times. 'Since mid-July, Kherson and its neighboring villages along the western side of the Dnipro River have suffered more than 9,500 attacks with small drones, killing at least 37 people and injuring hundreds more,' according to Prokudin, regional prosecutors and police. Russia had deployed some of its ‘best drone units’ across the Dnipro River,' Prokudin told the Financial Times. From the opposite bank of the river bisecting Kherson Oblast, 'Russians were launching advanced drone models, refining combat techniques and training new operators for their intensifying invasion.' Ukrainian officials say Russia may be preparing an attack across the Dnipro River. (Google Earth image) This Russian push is happening ahead of the return of Donald Trump to the White House, Ukrainian officials suggest, according to Financial Times. Trump has repeatedly said he can end the war within his first 24 hours of taking office, however, he has presented no definitive plans. You can read more about this later in our story. 'Ukrainian officials suspect the assault is part of Russia’s plan to ratchet up pressure on Kyiv before Donald Trump returns to the White House, accelerating battlefield gains and preparing for a potential push across the Dnipro River,' the publication explained. The push to gain as much territory as possible ahead of a potential freeze of the front lines as part of a peace deal has been expected. How successful that would be is a big question given the challenges of fording a major river, especially with major bridges down. Russian forces experienced the difficulty of such maneuvers as they unsuccessfully tried to cross the Seym River in Kursk and were pushed back yesterday from an attempted advance across the Oskil River in Kharkiv Oblast. Vessels crossing the Dnirpo would be quickly targeted by drones, anti-tank guided missiles and direct-fire weapons. Artillery could also be a problem for those trying to cross. Any central massing of Russian troops can be hit with artillery, GMLRS rockets, and stand-off aviation strike munitions liked winged JDAM-ER GPS-guided glide bombs, GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs (SDB) and AASM-250 Hammer rocket-assisted bombs. So far, the Russian attempts to cross the Dnipro have failed, the Southern Command spokesman claimed. 'All these assaults end in nothing,' said Voloshin. 'They are all fruitless. The enemy only bears losses.' Russia, however, can afford more losses than Ukraine. Forcing Kyiv to redeploy troops or weapons to the once stable Kherson region would only add to its battlefield woes as its defenses in the east continue to degrade. The Latest Elsewhere on the battlefield, Russian forces continued gaining ground in eastern Ukraine, especially in the Donetsk region. Another area of growing concern for Ukraine is a potential new Russian push in the Donetsk-Zaporizhzhia border area. Here are some key takeaways from the latest assessment from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). Kursk Oblast: Ukrainian forces recently advanced in the main Ukrainian salient in Kursk Oblast on December 3. 'Geolocated footage published on December 2 indicates that Ukrainian forces recently advanced in southern Darino (southeast of Korenevo),' ISW stated. Kharkiv Oblast: Russian forces conducted offensive operations along the international border north of Kharkiv City towards Kozacha Lopan, north of Kharkiv City near Hlyboke, and northeast of Kharkiv City near Starytsya and Vovchansk on December 2 and 3 but did not make any confirmed advances. Donetsk Oblast: Russian forces continued offensive operations northeast of Siversk near Bilohorivka and in the Chasiv Yar direction on December 3 but did not make any confirmed advances. However, they recently advanced south of Toretsk and south of Pokrovsk. Donetsk-Zaporizhzhia border area: Russian forces recently advanced north of Velyka Novosilka in Donetsk. Geolocated footage published on December 3 'indicates that Russian forces recently advanced in northern Novyi Komar (north of Velyka Novosilka),' ISW stated. 'Russian advances into Novyi Komar support multiple courses of action (COAs) that ISW recently forecasted the Russian military command might pursue, including enveloping or bypassing Velyka Novosilka to interdict the T0518 Velyka Novosilka-Bahatyr highway and advance into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, and advancing to Andriivka (west of Kurakhove) from the south.'

On Tuesday, Vassily Nebenzia Russia's U.N. ambassador, accused Ukrainian intelligence of supporting anti-regime forces opposing Syria's Bashar Assad. He alleged that some fighters were openly displaying their connections. Anti-regime forces fighting with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) 'have not only not concealed the fact that they are supported by Ukraine, but they are also openly flaunting this,' Nebenzia told the Security Council. There was an 'identifiable trail' showing Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR) was 'providing weapons to fighters' in northwest Syria. 'Ukrainian military instructors from the GUR are present &#8230; training HTS fighters for combat operations,' including against Russian troops in Syria, Nebenzia alleged. Abu Bakr, leader of a Syrian opposition drone team, reached out to Ukrainian military intelligence for guidance, the Clah report claims. 'Ukrainians supplied 3D printing files for key components like bomb carriers, tails, and warheads. This allowed the opposition to produce, assemble, and adapt their drones independently.' He and another Syrian drone operator stated that GUR is providing only training and guidance in conducting drone operations.

Ukraine's presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak was already in the U.S., Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha told reporters in Brussels, news agency Interfax Ukraine reported, according to Reuters. 'This contact at the level of the head of the (president's) office is very important for establishing, among other things, relations with representatives of the new administration,' Sybiha said. Yermak will be accompanied by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy Yuliia Svyrydenko, the New Voice of Ukraine media outlet reported. 'The primary goal of this trip is to meet with Trump associates, individuals from the entourage of newly elected U.S. President Donald Trump,' a source told the publication.

The New Voice of Ukraine (@NewVoiceUkraine) December 4, 2024 NATO's top leader is also urging Trump to stick with Ukraine. In an interview with the Financial Times, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte warned Trump of the serious threat posed by China, Iran, and North Korea if Ukraine is forced to sign a peace agreement on Russia’s terms. 'Rutte emphasized that deepening ties between U.S. adversaries endangered America as he made a pitch to the president-elect to stick with NATO and continue to support Ukraine,' the publication reported. Rutte noted the risks from Russia supplying missile technology to North Korea and cash to Iran. In an apparent reference to Taiwan, he said that Chinese President Xi Jinping 'might get thoughts about something else in the future if there is not a good deal [for Ukraine].' 'We cannot have a situation where we have [North Korean leader] Kim Jong Un and the Russian leader and Xi Jinping and Iran high-fiving because we came to a deal which is not good for Ukraine, because long-term that will be a dire security threat not only to Europe but also to the U.S.,' Rutte told the FT in his first interview as head of the western military alliance. NATO head warns that the US will be under enormous threat if Ukraine is forced into a 'peace' on the terms of Russia, Iran and North Korea. KyivPost (@KyivPost) December 4, 2024 During a conference ahead of NATO's Foreign Ministers meeting this week, Rutte argued that Ukraine needs to be put in a 'position of strength' instead of being pushed toward peace talks.

Our Best Look At Russia’s Shadowy Zircon Hypersonic Missile	A recent drill by the Russian Armed Forces in the Mediterranean has provided us with a more detailed view of the shadowy Zircon hypersonic missile, a weapon that has only been glimpsed in the past and shown up in the form of fragments after being combat tested in Ukraine. The maneuvers come as Russia’s position in Syria — home to its two major Mediterranean bases — increasingly looks to be under threat, as rebels continue their rapid advance south, threatening the rule of Bashar al-Assad, a key Kremlin ally.

From several different angles, the missile is seen emerging from the 3S14 vertical launch system (VLS) on the deck of a Russian Navy Project 22350 Admiral Gorshkov class frigate. The missile is seen pulling up, stabilized by vectoring rockets, before continuing on a vertical trajectory, at which point the video ends. Two views show the launch of a Zircon missile from the latest video. Russian Ministry of Defense capture Russian Ministry of Defense capture According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, the live-fire exercise took place in the eastern Mediterranean yesterday and involved sea-based and air-launched missiles. The frigates Admiral Gorshkov and Admiral Golovko are said to have fired Zirkon missiles, while the diesel-electric submarine Novorossiysk launched a Kalibr subsonic cruise missile. Meanwhile, on the Syrian coast, a Bastion coastal defense system launched an Oniks supersonic cruise missile. Another video showed a Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile being prepared under a MiG-31I fighter, although it’s unclear if this missile was also launched. Undoubtedly, various U.S. and NATO assets will also have been closely monitoring this exercise and likely yielding much new high-quality intelligence on Zircon and other systems.

We have seen an official video purporting to show a Zircon launch from close quarters before, but on that occasion, it was very difficult to see any details of the missile. This even led to some debate around whether that earlier video — released in October 2020 — may have been edited by splicing together a combination of footage showing one or more other weapons, and not just the Zircon. The 2020 video claimed to show the first test launch of the Zircon against a naval target, from the Gorshkov. A still from Russian Ministry of Defense footage shows a missile fired from the 16-cell 3S14 vertical launch system on the foredeck of the frigate Admiral Gorshkov, underway in the White Sea, in October 2020. This was the first official imagery purporting to show Zircon. Russian Ministry of Defense capture A Russian Ministry of Defense video that claims to show the Zircon test in the White Sea on October 6, 2020: Another video, released by the Russian Ministry of Defense in May 2022, is said to show the Gorshkov launching a Zircon, although the missile is seen only at a distance with no details visible: Comparing the new video with the one from 2020, it seems we are looking at the same missile, but there are still some questions about how it actually operates. Interestingly, much of the speculation around the Zircon back in 2020 focused on its potential relationship to one particular older design, the Oniks supersonic missile, which can also be fired from the 3S14 VLS. Seen from the bow of the warship, the Zircon climbs away after launch. Russian Ministry of Defense capture Another view of the Zircon after launch during a live-fire exercise yesterday. Russian Ministry of Defense capture The Oniks has also been used against land targets in Ukraine and in past fighting in Syria, and the Zircon is similarly billed as a dual-use weapon. In the past, the Russian Ministry of Defense has claimed that the Zircon has reached a speed 'more than Mach 8' in tests, while Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the weapon has a top speed of around Mach 9 and a range of approximately 620 miles. If true, that would put it firmly in the hypersonic category. In contrast, the Oniks flies at a maximum speed of up to Mach 2.2, powered by a liquid-fuel ramjet motor. Its maximum range is said to be 180 miles, although this is greatly reduced when flying a low-altitude profile. Mockup of a Yakhont missile (the export version of the Onyx). Boevaya mashina/Wikimedia Commons Boevaya_mashina The Zircon looks very different from the ‘waverider’-type hypersonic missile that the Russian media has used to illustrate it in the past. As in the U.S. Air Force’s experimental X-51 Waverider, this type of missile uses supersonic shockwaves to maintain the flight vehicle’s lift and stability. It would typically use a conventional rocket motor to bring it to the required speed and altitude, before an air-breathing high-speed engine, such as a scramjet, takes over. One of a number of graphics circulating on the internet purporting to show the Zircon. via AINOnline In January 2023, the Russian Ministry of Defense said that the Gorshkov had set out on a deployment armed, for the first time, with Zircon missiles, as you can read about here. Officials in Russia have said in the past that they expect a number of other types of ships and submarines, including the Russian Navy’s advanced and extremely quiet nuclear-powered Yasen and Yasen-M class submarines, to be able to employ Zircon in the future. In October 2021, Russia claimed that it had successfully test-launched the Zircon from a submarine for the first time, as you can read about here. However, the apparent combat debut of the Zircon appears to have made use of a ground-based launcher of some kind. In February this year, Ukrainian scientists claimed that Russia had, for the first time, used the Zircon in attacks on at least one target in Ukraine. Alongside these claims, the scientists showed a video of the alleged Zircon wreckage — 'fragments of the engine and steering mechanisms [with] specific markings.' Various alleged fragments of a Zircon missile were presented by the Kyiv Scientific-Research Institute for Forensic Examinations. via X Most interestingly, the Kyiv Scientific-Research Institute for Forensic Examinations also provided a line drawing of a supposed Zircon missile that looks very different from previous renderings. Instead of a waverider-type design, the drawing showed a missile with more in common with a very high-speed ramjet-powered design. The two-stage weapon features a cap over the nose that likely conceals an annular air intake, which feeds the main engine once the first-stage booster falls away. A similar approach was used in the Boeing HyFly, a demonstrator for a hypersonic ramjet-powered cruise missile. This would also seem to broadly tally with the video of the Zircon from yesterday’s exercise in the Mediterranean. A presumed mockup of the Boeing HyFly hypersonic vehicle at the TSNII VVKO, a secretive Russian military research facility. Zvezda TV The apparent evidence from Ukraine, combined with the latest video of the Zircon also point to a missile that with similar overall dimensions to the Oniks, and, most likely, an annular air intake. Similarity with the Oniks would also make it easier to fire the Zircon from the same type of ground launcher, which appears to have been the case when it was used against Ukraine. In the video we see the missile bulbous nose cap that will separate as it transitions to forward sustained flight. A close-up of the Zircon from the latest video shows the distinctive nose cap, apparently concealing an annular intake. Russian Ministry of Defense capture The U.K. Ministry of Defense assessed that, when used against Ukraine, the Zircon was likely fired from the land-based Bastion coastal defense system, which normally fires Oniks missiles. 'It is likely the Russians are testing a newly operational weapon system in a live conflict environment to provide assurance and demonstrate capability,' the U.K. Ministry of Defense added. In many ways, the Zircon remains an enigmatic weapon, with precise details of its operating principle and performance still unconfirmed. The operational status of the missile is also somewhat unclear, although Russia does now seem to be more willing to show the Zircon in greater detail than was the case in the past.

Mysterious Object Appears At Remote Chinese Airfield Linked To Sp...	Recent satellite imagery shows a curious white-colored object at the end of the runway at a remote airstrip in northwestern China. The airfield, which is situated near the Lop Nur nuclear test site, has been tied to Chinese reusable space plane developments in the past. A satellite image taken on November 29 that The War Zone obtained from Planet Labs shows the white-colored object, along with several smaller ones, which look to be vehicles and support equipment, at the southwestern end of the desert airstrip's runway. The runway itself is over 16,400 feet in total length, or more than 3 miles long, which makes it one of the longest anywhere in the world. A row of vehicles is also visible at the facility's main apron, which has been significantly expanded in recent years, including with the addition of a new large hangar.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION What the larger object on the runway might be, or even its exact shape, is unclear. Though it looks broadly cylindrical from above, its body is also seen casting a distinctly wedge-shaped shadow. Some obscuration of markings on the runway may point to the presence of short stubby wings at one end. It has an overall length of around 32 feet.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION As already noted, the remote Chinese airfield and its extremely long runway have previously been linked to work on reusable spaceplanes with potential military applications, including ones believed to be roughly akin in form and function to the X-37B. The War Zone's first report on this facility came after it appeared that one of these crafted touched down there following the end of a mission in space in September 2020. The recently observed object is comparable length-wise to the U.S. Space Force's two secretive X-37B mini-shuttles (just over 29 feet long), though that alone does not mean there is a relationship between the two.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Chinese authorities did announce the return to Earth of a 'reusable experimental spacecraft' back on September 6 following 268 days in orbit, but there are no indications that what is seen in the November 29 satellite image is in any way directly related. Reusable spaceplanes do sit on the runway for at least some amount of time after they land for post-mission servicing, including the removal of any remaining fuels or other payloads, and other preparation for relocation to a more secure location. However, those are not processes that take days, let alone weeks or months, to complete. The object's apparent orientation with its rear toward the end of the runway would not point to a recovery, either. At the same time, if the object at the end of the runway is indeed spaceplane-related, it could reflect a general need for personnel at the remote airfield to train for ground-handling activities. It also could be some other kind of test article. It is also worth noting here that Felix Schöfbänker, an amateur Australian space watcher, did capture imagery of what is believed to be the spaceplane that touched back down in September while it was still in orbit. From what is visible, it has been suggested that the craft might have a delta-wing planform, which could be in line with the 'wings' on the object seen in the November 29 image of the airstrip near Lop Nur.

In 2007, pictures did emerge that showed one such design called Shenlong (meaning Divine Dragon), or a related test article, under the fuselage of a People's Liberation Army (PLA) H-6 bomber. We also got a look at a full-size model of another reusable mini-shuttle design, called Haolong, back in October around this year's Zhuhai Airshow. State-run Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) subsidiary Chengdu is developing Haolong officially as an option for resupplying the country's Tiangong space station.

HaoLong-1 cargo spaceplane pic.twitter.com/Dthfd1gi1v&mdash; China 'N Asia Spaceflight 𝕏 (@CNSpaceflight) November 11, 2024 The object seen in the November 29 satellite image could also be something entirely unrelated to spaceplane developments, as well. A remote facility with a runway this long would be a useful location for a wide array of aerospace-related testing activities away from prying eyes. Whatever the object might have been, it does not appear to be related to a warning notice to aviators that emerged at around the same time. A series of posts from @thenewarea51 on X called our attention to the so-called Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM), which covered an area further to the southwest that contains multiple large-scale targets with the outlines of warships. This includes one that is clearly meant to represent the U.S. Navy's newest supercarrier USS Gerald R. Ford.

The PLA has been very actively developing and fielding increasingly longer-range anti-ship capabilities, including longer-range ballistic missiles capable of hitting moving vessels, and the kill webs required to execute those strikes, as part of a broader anti-access/area-denial strategy. A before and after look at the Arleigh Burke class destroyer-shaped target that was hit around the time the NOTAM was active. PHOTO © 2024 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Regardless, the PLA does also have a clear interest in reusable spaceplanes, which could provide valuable platforms for the rapid deployment of relatively small satellites and other payloads into space. They could also act as space-based intelligence-gathering assets or even anti-satellite weapons, areas that China's armed forces have also been investing in heavily in recent years. With all this in mind, the rare appearance of a curious object, whatever it might be, on the huge runway at the remote airstrip near Lop Nur is notable.

F-35A’s 25mm Gun Still Needs Tests To Verify It Works	The Pentagon says more testing is required to demonstrate that the 25mm automatic cannon mounted internally on the F-35A variant of the Joint Strike Fighter is indeed now an effective weapon. Various software and hardware issues had long left the stealthy jets unable to shoot straight, but fixes intended to resolve them have been implemented. New questions about the actual effectiveness of the F-35A's internal gun emerged last month after the Project on Government Oversight (POGO), an independent nonprofit, published a heavily redacted declassified copy of a report on the Joint Strike Fighter program from the Pentagon's Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E). POGO obtained the document, which is dated February 2024, via the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and provided its own analysis of the contents. The report also underscored long-standing maintenance and logistics challenges that have contributed to historically low readiness rates across all variants of the F-35 and that could have worrisome impacts on future combat operations. The War Zone has explored those issues and their broader ramifications in detail in a past feature. 'The F-35 lethality assessment suffered from the inability of the F-35's gun to hit the targets because of design and installation issues,' according to an unredacted section of the February 2024 DOT&E report that POGO obtained. For context, each F-35A has a four-barrelled 25mm Gatling-type cannon, designated the GAU-22/A, mounted internally in a space above the aircraft’s left engine intake. The gun has a rate of fire of 3,300 rounds per minute and feeds from a 180-round magazine. A flush-mounted door opens when the gun is fired and closes when it stops to maintain the jet's stealth signature. The F-35B and C variants do not have internal guns, but can carry GPU-9/A gun pods that contain a GAU-22/A and 220 rounds of ammunition. It is no secret that problems tied to how certain symbology was presented to pilots through their helmet-mounted displays (HMD) had prevented all three F-35 variants from employing their guns effectively in the past. F-35s lack a traditional heads-up display (HUD) in their cockpits. The information a pilot would typically get from a HUD is instead projected onto the visor of their helmet. The design of the internal mount for the GAU-22/A on the A version of the F-35 was also found years ago to have been so badly misaligned that it not only negatively impacted accuracy, but also caused physical damage to the aircraft from firing the gun. Additional concerns about cracking on the F-35A as a result of gun use have also surfaced in recent years. You can read more about the F-35's gun-related woes in detail here. 'After working with the Air Force and our industry partners we can report that the gun has been improved and is effective,' Russ Goemaere, a spokesperson for the F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO), had told The War Zone in March of this year. 'We continue to work with industry, the Services, and our international partners for further improvements and to maximize effectiveness and lethality at the tactical/operational level.' 'The F-35 JPO made changes to hardware and software resulting in improved and effective gun operations,' Goemaere told The War Zone again last month in response to questions about the contents of the February 2024 DOT&E report. 'Operational testing of the F-35A/B/C gun systems occurred during F-35 Initial Operational Test and Evaluation [IOT&E]. The majority of this testing was in 2018 and 2019,' a U.S. defense official also told The War Zone in response to a question about when the 'F-35 lethality assessment' referred to in the DOT&E report actually occurred. 'Operational testing of the F-35A/B/C gun systems with the latest iteration of fixes is planned, but has not occurred. DOT&E does not yet have data or reports that would alter the observations in the IOT&E report,' that same U.S. defense official added when asked about whether DOT&E currently agrees with the F-35 JPO's current assessment of the effectiveness of the F-35A's gun. The effectiveness of the F-35A's internally mounted gun has been a particular talking point with regard to the U.S. Air Force's ongoing plan to retire the venerable A-10 Warthog ground attack jet and its famed 30mm GAU-8/A Avenger cannon. The A variant of the Joint Strike Fighter has been presented as the primary replacement aircraft. A separate and equally heavily redacted DOT&E report regarding still highly controversial comparison testing of the F-35A and the A-10C that occurred between 2018 and 2019 did refer to a need to 'fix the F-35A gun,' but any further context was censored. POGO also obtained that report, which is dated Febraury 2022 and had been effectively buried, via FOIA and subsequent litigation, and published it last year. An A-10 fires its GAU-8/A Avenger cannon. USAF An A-10 Warthog firing its iconic GAU-8/A Avenger cannon. USAF Effective or not, the GAU-22/A inside the F-35A with its 180 rounds of ammunition (which equates to just over three seconds of total firing time) cannot be directly compared in any way to the A-10's legendarily huge GAU-8/A, which feeds from a 1,174-round magazine. The 30mm rounds the GAU-8/A fires are much larger than the 25mm ones that the GAU-22/A spits out, too. It is worth noting that the Avenger caused serious problems during the initial development fielding of the A-10, as you can learn more about here and in the video below. The F-35A's ammunition load for its gun is small even in comparison to that of other stealthy and non-stealthy jets in U.S. service today. The M61 Vulcan cannons on U.S. Air Force F-16C Vipers and F-22 Raptors, for instance, have 500 and 480 rounds of 20mm ammunition to go along with them, respectively. The GAU-22/A's 25mm rounds are bigger than the 20mm shells that M61s fire. Questions have also been raised about the utility of available ammunition for the GAU-22/A. The primary operational round that all F-35s fire from their guns, whether they be internally mounted or in pods, is the PGU-48/B, referred to as a Frangible Armor Piercing (FAP) type. It is a kinetic round designed to damage/destroy targets through force of impact. The 'frangible' tungsten penetrator inside also breaks up after hitting its mark to create deadly shrapnel. Despite its lack of explosive or incendiary elements, the PGU-48/B is said to be effective against aircraft, as well as armored vehicles and soft-skinned ground targets, according to the manufacturer, Germany's Rheinmetall. What demonstrated effects the rounds may have against enemy personnel are unclear. Rheinmetall A 2014 briefing slide providing a general overview of the PGU-48/B and showing a cutaway of one of the cartridges. Rheinmetall At around $131 dollars per round, the PGU-48/Bs are also expensive. The price point for a single 20mm PGU-28A/B semi-armor-piercing high-explosive incendiary cartridge, the main ammunition type for Vulcan cannons in Air Force jets, is around $34. There remains a possibility that other 25mm ammunition types, such as high explosive and/or incendiary rounds, could be certified for use in the GAU-22/A in the future. The close air support mission, even when performed by the A-10, is ever more about the employment of precision-guided munitions rather than strafing runs. The Air Force's argument for retiring the Warthogs, a process that is now very much underway and looks set to be completed by the end of the decade if not well before then, has been centered on this reality. A-10s are still flying combat missions, including just this week in Syria. At the same time, a working gun can still be an important tool for tactical aircraft to have in various circumstances. An accurate aerial gun offers the ability to provide even more focused fire on a target, and even more limited risk of collateral damage than most precision munitions, which can be particularly useful for supporting ground forces in dense urban environments. In air-to-air combat, the expectation is that traditional dogfights will become increasingly uncommon, especially for stealthy jets like the F-35 with its still-growing array of other advanced capacities, At the same time, visual-range aerial engagements could still occur in future conflicts, including during lower-end missions in dense airspace with tight rules of engagement or in high-end fights with large volumes of enemy and friendly forces operating in relatively constrained battlespaces. Guns continue to provide immediate backup firepower for tactical jets should they run out of other munitions, in general. This was just recently highlighted by new details about the U.S. military's contribution to the defense of Israel against incoming Iranian threats back in April. At least one Air Force F-15E Strike Eagle crew switched to their Vulcan cannon after they ran out of missiles while swatting down drones, though they were unable to score any gun kills. In the meantime, DOT&E says it is still waiting to see the data showing that F-35A pilots can effectively do the same if necessary.

Russia’s Advanced Podlet-1K Radar Captured By Anti-Assad Forces I...	An advanced Russian air defense radar system is among the equipment captured by anti-regime forces in Syria as they continue their rapid push south, a development that has the potential for serious repercussions in the wider region. The Podlet-K1 radar system, also known by the designation 48Ya6-K1, is one of the more modern pieces of equipment in the Russian inventory, has been employed in the war in Ukraine, and would be a significant intelligence windfall if it were to possibly find its way into Western hands. Wow. Rebels also captured the antenna vehicle of the advanced Russian 48Ya6-K1 'Podlet-K1' multipurpose mobile three-coordinate S-Band radar system, specifically designed to detect air targets at low and extremely low altitudes.Operates with S-300/400 etc, very capable. pic.twitter.com/etjXgaBVmb&mdash; Cᴀʟɪʙʀᴇ Oʙsᴄᴜʀᴀ (@CalibreObscura) December 4, 2024 A photo of the captured Podlet-K1, which is mounted on a KamAZ-6350 8×8 truck chassis, appeared recently on social media, although when it was taken remains unclear. Furthermore, there’s no confirmation of its exact location, although some have suggested that it was captured during fighting around the city of Hama, in west-central Syria.

After Hama-Masyaf road cut soon - only Hama-Homs road before complete siege pic.twitter.com/MwfiW3f7FN&mdash; Liveuamap MiddleEast (@lummideast) December 4, 2024 A logo that appears in the corner of the photo suggests that the rebels responsible for capturing the system were from the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). This has a long and involved history in the Syrian conflict and is spearheading the current assault toward the south. The photo shows the vehicle carrying the radar antenna in its lowered position. The complete system also includes another two trucks — an operator control station, and an energy support vehicle — which may or may not also now be in rebel hands. In promotional material, the Podlet-K1 is described as being optimized to detect aerial targets flying at low and very low altitudes. It does this using a phased-array radar antenna, operating in the S-band and reportedly able to track up to 200 targets simultaneously. The main antenna is complemented by a pair of other radars used for identification friend or foe (IFF) functions. Introduced to service around 2018, the Podlet-K1 can be used alongside the S-300PMU-2 and S-400 long-range surface-to-air missile systems, complementing their own detection radars, and other sensors. The reported maximum detection range of the Podlet-K1 is 200-300 kilometers (124-186 miles), although this would vary greatly in real-world situations, depending on many factors, including target type, altitude, and more. According to Ukrainian media reports, the complete system is worth around $5 million. The three vehicles that comprise the 48Ya6-K1 Podlet-K1 system. The radar vehicle is nearest the camera, with the antenna lowered for transport. Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation Timofey_Nikishin_nikisht It’s not clear if the Podlet-K1 was formally part of the Syrian Armed Forces, or if it belonged to a Russian unit operating in the country, although Syrian and Russian air defenses are already closely aligned in some respects. There are unconfirmed reports it was captured from the Syrian 25th Special Forces Division, although that doesn’t preclude it from being a Russian-operated system co-located with this unit. Already, Syrian rebels have captured significant quantities of military equipment as they advance south, including tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, rocket launchers, and even aircraft.

The Podlet-K1 would seem to be the most interesting item identified so far, however, on account of its modernity and the fact that, as far as we know, Ukraine has not managed to capture an intact one from Russian forces fighting there. At least two Podlet-K1 systems, or parts of them, have been destroyed by Ukrainian forces. One of these was within Russian territory when it was hit, by a long-range drone strike in September of this year. Before that, as TWZ reported in July of 2022, another Podlet-K1 was apparently targeted by an M31A1 guided multiple-launch rocket system (GMLRS) in the Kherson region of Ukraine. The war in Ukraine has already provided plenty of examples of high-end Russian military equipment being captured and then being subject to extensive analysis. This has even included some items being transported to the United States for a technical evaluation. Equipment captured in Ukraine has, in particular, provided insights into Russian electronic warfare capabilities, including containerized components of vehicle-borne systems, among them signals intelligence (SIGINT) systems, as well as airborne jamming pods. Like these, the Podlet-K1 would be of significant interest to military intelligence agencies, especially those of the United States and NATO, providing insight into the capabilities of one of Russia’s more modern air defense radars. As an example of FME of Russian equipment, in 2018, the U.S. Army reportedly took delivery of a Ukrainian 36D6M1-1 air defense radar, an example of which is seen here and that is associated with the S-300 air defense system. UKROBORONPROM Knowledge of the Russian military’s ability to detect low-flying aerial targets over the battlefield — including drones and cruise missiles, but also helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft — would be especially useful when it comes to fielding countermeasures. Having insight into the workings of the Podlet-K1 could allow the West to develop means not only of blunting its capabilities but also of feeding it false signals and devising tactics to exploit its weaknesses, both in terms of operations and in the cyber realm. While the United States is well known for its extensive so-called foreign materiel exploitation (FME) programs, dating back to the earliest years of the Cold War, actually getting the Podlet-K1 into the hands of U.S. or other NATO analysts is another matter. The situation on the ground in Syria is confused and it’s possible that the Podlet-K1 is no longer in anti-Assad forces' hands, although we have seen no proof of that being the case. There is also a possibility that it might have been destroyed by now, perhaps even being targeted by a Russian airstrike to prevent it from yielding any sensitive information. Bringing Russian-made equipment out of an active war zone outside of Ukraine is not impossible, however. In this case, one possible route out of Syria might involve the system being handed over via Turkish intelligence. Back in June 2020, the U.S. military reportedly spirited a Russian-made Pantsir-S1 out of Libya, after it was captured from forces aligned with rogue general Khalifa Haftar. Turkey was also involved here as an intermediary. The operation was ostensibly aimed at preventing the system from falling into the hands of any number of militant and terrorist groups in that country, but there would also be clear intelligence benefits, too, as you can read about here. A Pantsir-S1 air defense system captured from forces aligned with Khalifa Haftar at Al Watiya Air Base, Libya, in May 2020. via X Reportedly, a U.S. Air Force C-17A Globemaster III transport aircraft flew into Zuwarah International Airport, to the west of Tripoli, picked up the Pantsir-S1, and then flew it to Ramstein Air Base in Germany. Whatever happens next with the captured Podlet-K1 vehicle, its fate is emblematic of the dramatic progress made by the Syrian rebels in a short amount of time. The vehicle’s loss is symptomatic of the regime forces — and their Russian backers — having been caught by surprise. As long as the rebel push continues, they are likely to get their hands on more equipment, and the capture of further high-end Russian items shouldn’t be ruled out.
