Houthi Weapons Arsenal Remains A Mystery To The U.S.	The U.S. remains puzzled about how many weapons the Houthis have or where they get them all, a senior U.S. defense official told The War Zone, adding that the militants are highly innovative when it comes to developing their arsenal. Meanwhile, numerous airstrikes by the U.S. and its allies on Houthi targets in Yemen have not halted the rebel group’s ability to produce the weapons and use them at will, the official said. 'There's some debate as to what's in their magazine,' the official told The War Zone during a media engagement at the Air and Space Forces Association Air Warfare Symposium in Aurora, Colorado. 'There's a good bit right now we don't know about the Houthis.' The official spoke a day before the U.S. officially designated Ansar Allah - the official name of the Houthis - as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.

They have forced ships to avoid the Suez Canal for a far longer route around Africa, boosting cargo costs by nearly $200 billion. The Houthis’ attacks sank two vessels, damaged many others, caused the death of four mariners, and led to many being held hostage after a ship was seized. There were also a lot of Houthi weapons that missed their targets entirely. The CHIOS Lion was attacked by the Houthis last July. (Houthi screencap) In response to these attacks, the U.S. and its allies have engaged numerous Houthi missiles and air and sea drones to protect commercial vessels as well as themselves.

Despite this ongoing fight, the depth and scope of the Houthi arsenal is largely a mystery, stated the official, who offered begrudging respect for the terror group’s weapons development capabilities. 'What I can tell about the Houthis is they iterate, and they're pretty innovative,' the official explained. 'So we see them putting together weapon systems and put them together in ways, give them a try, and a lot of times they fail. But we talk about the military about ‘failing forward’ and being innovative, and with a begrudging tip of the hat to the Houthis, they're actually doing that.' 'We've been surprised at times with some of the things that we see them do, and it makes us scratch our head a little bit,' the official noted, adding that the Houthis are 'not super technologically advanced, but we do think they're pretty innovative.' ©2023, The International Institute for Strategic Studies, originally published on with permission) (International Institute of Strategic Studies) While the extent of the Houthi weapons stocks is unknown, 'we do think that they do a lot of production in-house,' the official told us. 'Our assessment right now is that there's likely some key components and other things that come from Iran or other places, but a lot of the actual production is in Yemen.' The official declined to say what components the Houthis have procured. The Houthi Red Sea campaign led to nearly constant military engagements with the U.S. and its allies, including air strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. The most recent U.S. attack took place on Jan. 8, according to U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM). That’s when CENTCOM’s 'forces conducted multiple precision strikes against two Iranian-backed Houthi underground Advanced Conventional Weapon (ACW) storage facilities within Houthi-controlled territories of Yemen. The Houthis used these facilities to conduct attacks against U.S. Navy warships and merchant vessels in the southern Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.'

'I wouldn't say we've changed their weapons production capabilities, because again, I'll go back to there's still a lot of unknowns right now,' the official mused. 'We knew some of the threats, we know some of the effects that they try and do. And there are some things we're still working on.' The official declined to elaborate. In January, as a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas was announced, the Houthis pledged to halt shipping attacks. There have been none since. According to another U.S. defense official, the last such Houthi attack took place on Dec. 9-10, when U.S. Navy destroyers USS Stockdale and USS O’Kane 'successfully defeated a range of Houthi-launched weapons while transiting the Gulf of Aden,' according to CENTCOM.

'Lebanese Hezbollah clearly has been hurt a great deal by Israel,' the official explained. 'We see militia groups in Iraq right now being less active. And so the one outlier to all of that is the Houthis. You see them very active. There are differing opinions on how much direct control Iran has over the Houthis, but we think that they continue to support them through a lot of different avenues.' On Monday, the Houthis vowed to resume military operations against Israel if the ceasefire breaks down. 'The Yemeni armed forces are ready to resume operations in response to Zionist violations,' Nasr al-Din Amer, deputy head of the Houthis’ Media Authority, said, according to Shafaq News. 'It’s too early to specify the scale of escalation, but at a minimum, Jaffa will be under fire.' It’s unclear if the Houthis will also resume attacking shipping. If they resume standoff attacks on Israel and shipping, it’s unknown how long the Yemen-based militant group can maintain such an operation as their seemingly resilient ability to construct the weapons used in those attacks remains something of a mystery.

Collaborative Combat Drones Designed From Ground Up To Do Combat ...	The U.S. Air Force's new Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones are being developed around fundamentally different understandings of maintenance, logistics, and sustainment, with a heavy focus on commercial-of-the-shelf components, than the service's existing crewed and uncrewed platforms. This is particularly true regarding how CCAs will be supported at forward locations during future conflicts as the drones are the first aircraft designed from the ground up around concepts for distributed and disaggregated operations collectively referred to as Agile Combat Employment (ACE). The Air & Space Forces Association hosted a panel discussion on CCA logistics at its 2025 Warfare Symposium yesterday, at which TWZ was in attendance. Air Force Maj. Gen. Joseph Kunkel, Director of Force Design, Integration, and Wargaming within the office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Air Force Futures, was one of three panelists. The other two were Mike Atwood, Vice President for Advanced Programs at General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. (GA-ASI), and Andrew Van Timmeren, Senior Director of Autonomous Airpower at Anduril Industries. In 2024, the Air Force picked GA-ASI and Anduril to design and build CCA prototypes, now designated YFQ-42A and YFQ-44A, respectively, as part of the program's first phase or Increment 1. Requirements for a second tranche of CCAs, or Increment 2, which could be more costly, are coalescing now. The service expects to buy between 100 and 150 Increment 1 CCAs, but has said in the past that it could ultimately acquire at least a thousand of the drones across all of the program's increments. It remains unclear whether the Air Force plans to buy just YF-42As or YF-44As, or a mix of both, under Increment 1. A composite rendering of the CCA designs that General Atomics, at top, and Anduril, at bottom, are currently developing, along with their new formal designations. General Atomics/Anduril 'We need to think about how we survive and generate combat power from the inside, and how do we strengthen our position on the inside? And part of that is distributed basing,' Kunkel said near the start of yesterday's panel discussion by way of introduction. 'The ability to create multiple dilemmas for our adversaries, &#8230; multiple places where they have to distribute and make choices about whether they're going to target or not, that's a really big deal for us.' 'That distributed basing also creates a lot of inefficiencies in how you might sustain something,' Kundel continued. 'Some of the design attributes that these two teams have been building into their CCAs are exactly that - you don't want to have a huge additional footprint that's required. You don't want to have, like, the big sustainment requirements.' 'You want to be able to use commercial stuff to the max extent [so] you don't have to take specialized refueling equipment, specialized loading equipment' to forward locations, the Air Force's force design boss added. Specialized maintenance and logistics demands, as well as the need for more bespoke equipment on the ground to support flight operations, have been major hurdles for the Air Force when it comes to implementing the ACE concepts using existing crewed and uncrewed aircraft. GA-ASI's Atwood highlighted lessons learned from the Air Force's Rapid Raptor and Rapid Reaper concepts for quickly deploying small force packages of F-22 Raptor stealth fighters and MQ-9 Reaper drones, respectively, along with supporting assets to forward locations. The MQ-9 is another General Atomics product and the company helped in the development of a 'kit' to assist with deploying and sustaining those drones within the ACE construct. This includes using the Reapers themselves to carry their own sustainment kits into a remote locale and to conduct limited resupply missions by carrying small cargoes in travel pods under their wings. A travel pod under the wing of an MQ-9 Reaper. USAF 'So our CCA aircraft uses that pedigree' and has 'a footprint today' that is focused on forward-deployed operations and reducing maintenance demands as much as possible, Atwood said yesterday. 'The best aircraft is the one you don't do maintenance on.' He also highlighted 'condition-based maintenance' concepts leveraging systems on the drones to alert maintainers and help them start ahead of larger issues. The CCA 'should tell you when it's starting to cough a little bit and get sick.' General Atomics' CCA design also incorporates other features to ensure it can operate from more far-flung locations with more limited infrastructure, including shorter and less well-maintained runways. Atwood again used prior experience with the MQ-9 to help illustrate these challenges. 'We showed up at these World War II leftover airfields. And we quickly realized these airfields are in really bad shape, really bad shape, and we started to really appreciate runway distance,' Atwood explained. 'It's hard to make a fast-moving aircraft use a lot less runway. And so what we realized is we needed a trailing-arm landing gear.' A trailing-arm helps smooth the impact of landing, which in turn can help reduce wear and tear. This is especially beneficial for CCAs flying from short and potentially rough fields during future operations. A model of General Atomics CCA design. Jamie Hunter When it comes to Anduril's CCA design, also known as Fury, Van Timmeren talked about how features to make it more readily maintainable in the field, as well as low-maintenance overall, were baked in early on. Van Timmeren, a retired Air Force officer who flew F-22s, previously worked for Blue Force Technologies, which started Fury's development in the late 2010s and was then acquired by Anduril in 2023. You can read the full story of how Fury came to be in this past in-depth TWZ feature. 'Early on, you communicate with your engineering team, not just the performance characteristics of the hardware that you want &#8230; we also want to say everything has to be easily accessible for the design. Everything has to be easily line replaceable,' Van Timmeren said yesterday. 'We have ease of access for all the panels [on Fury].' Another 'one of the things that's critical to the ease of supportability is leveraging as much as possible commercial components. So engines that are flight-certified, already in mass production for the civilian aviation community. Wheels, tires, brakes, hydraulic actuators, all the sub-components that go into a vehicle,' he added, also noting that no bespoke tools are required to do work on Fury. A model of Anduril's Fury. Jamie Hunter A 'perfect example of that actually is the engine [on Fury],' Van Timmeren continued. 'We're using a commercial engine that is in production, is FAA [Federal Aviation Administration] certified, millions of flight hours on it.' Fury is powered by a single Williams International FJ44-4M turbofan engine. FJ44 variants are in widespread use, especially on business jets, including members of the popular Cessna Citation family. Van Timmeren also used the example of needing to replace a blown tire to further illustrate the value of using components more readily available on the commercial market. Bespoke tires for military aircraft can be wildly expensive, as TWZ has reported on in the past. They can also be harder to source overall. If you blow a tire, 'you might have to go out in the community to find it,' Van Timmeren said. Using commercial parts available through global logistics networks means you can 'go to local FBO and buy it,' he added, referring to fixed-base operator/fixed-based operations contractors who provide general aviation support services at airports. TWZ has reported in the past about the serious issues the Air Force has already been facing with spare part supply chains, especially when it comes to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. During yesterday's panel discussion, both General Atomics' Atwood and Anduril's Van Timmeren highlighted the benefits that new and improving manufacturing processes, including 3D printing and other additive manufacturing techniques, are also expected to bring to the CCA sustainment pipeline. Supporting CCA operations, especially at more remote and/or austere forward locations, isn't just about the drones themselves. Maj. Gen. Kunkel had already highlighted these issues just recently at a separate talk the Hudson Institute think tank hosted last week. 'I will tell you, some of it’s not like the sexy, cool stuff. It’s like the basics. It’s like bomb loaders, missile loaders, and, you know, refueling trucks and, you know, electric carts and air conditioning carts,' he said at that time. 'They’ve got to be made differently.' To help in this regard, General Atomics' CCA design features an all-electric start-up capability that requires no off-board support. 'So you can hit a button, the plane will start up, taxi, [and] take off all on its own,' according to Atwood. Any ground support equipment and other assets needed to support CCAs at forward locations also have to be able to get there in the first place with the same level of rapidity. 'I employed the James Bond model. I only want to maintain something that I could jump out of the back of the C-130 with,' Atwood said. 'When you think about the sustainment architectures that we built in the past, the thought was that they were going to be in sanctuary. So, you know, you could afford to build a piece of aircraft ground equipment that weighed 10,000 pounds and wouldn’t fit on a C-130,' Maj. Gen. Kunkel had also noted last week at the Hudson Institute talk. Members of the U Air Force unload lighting carts from a C-130 at Moscow's Vnukovo International Airport in support of President Barack Obama's visit to Russia in 2009. USAF Focusing assets that will fit inside a C-130 or a similarly-sized platform may not be enough to support future CCA operations. 'We use MQ-9 to carry parts between bases, and that's something we've done in the past, and something we'll continue to do,' but 'the concept of logistics, what we need for airlift, is going to change potentially,' Maj. Gen. Kunkel said yesterday. 'And you need a cargo aircraft that can very agilely deliver parts, and deliver weapons, and deliver material to places that are inside.' 'I think CCA can actually be, in some cases, a mobility aircraft,' General Atomics Atwood said, highlighting the internal bay on his company's design. 'One of the reasons that GA chose to have an internal weapons bay was for carrying not just missiles and kinetics, but to do that logistics.' All of this is set to have downstream operational and other impacts across the Air Force. 'So many people think about survivability in the air, in air combat phase, but just as important is survivability on the ground,' General Atomics' Atwood said. The ACE concepts of operations, at their core, are heavily centered on making it difficult for an opponent to target friendly forces on the ground. There also an increasingly heated debate about whether the Air Force, in particular, should be doing more to physically harden its existing main operating bases against attack, as you can read more about here. 'So, minimizing your turn time on the aircraft,' helped by using commercial components and supporting assets, 'gets you to have a turnaround time that is extremely difficult for the adversary' to get its targeting cycle around, Atwood added. Atwood further noted that the often discussed need for more 'affordable mass' to provide the required air combat capacity to win future conflicts could be provided with fewer platforms if they're more survivable, including on the ground, and can be employed at a very high tempo. The General Atomics executive also highlighted the value of increasingly autonomous capabilities in further reducing the required footprint on the ground. 'The other part about autonomy is it takes a [control] van out of it. So I need less deployed footprint, less chow halls, less barracks,' Atwood said. The view inside a ground control station for the MQ-9 Reaper. USAF 'For a number of ways, simplicity eliminates vulnerabilities,' Maj. Gen. Kunkel also said. 'What it also does, it opens up the aperture on where you can actually place these things.' Kunkel noted that CCAs could operate from allied and partner airbases, and even from commercial airports, in addition to fully U.S.-controlled facilities, during future operations. The Air Force has already been using a mix of test aircraft, crewed and uncrewed, to help lay the ground work for its future CCAs, including just how the drones will be integrated into its force structure and day-to-day training and other activities, as well as combat operations. Yesterday, Kunkel noted that his service has established an Experimental Operations Unit (EOU) dedicated to this work at Creech Air Force Base in Nevada. The Air Force announced last year that it would be increasing purchases of prototype Increment 1 CCAs to further help in this regard. CCAs are 'going to be the first aircraft that we have developed specifically for ACE,' Kunkel stressed. 'That's going to be the game changer for us.' For the Air Force to truly get the most out of its future CCA fleets, a new logistics and sustainment ecosystem will be required. General Atomics and Anduril have already been baking those demands into their YFQ-42A and YFQ-44A designs.

South Korean F-16s Just Bombed A Town By Accident	A pair of F-16 fighters operated by the Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF) accidentally bombed a civilian area during a live-fire military exercise today. The incident took place ahead of large-scale joint maneuvers with U.S. forces in South Korea, the first of their kind since U.S. President Donald Trump returned to the White House.

According to the Yonhap news agency, a 60-year-old who had been driving at the time of the incident was left with shrapnel lodged in their neck. There was also extensive damage to buildings in the area, including a church and houses. 'There was a sudden loud roar of a fighter jet, then an explosion rang out. When I went to the scene, there were about four houses that were halved from the damage, people hurt,' Oh Moung-su, a 65-year-old resident, told Reuters.

Republic of Korea Armed Forces BOHYUN PYUN The maneuvers today occurred ahead of planned combined drills involving South Korea and the United States, known as Freedom Shield. These are the first of their kind under the new Trump administration and are due to run from March 10 to 20. South Korean military officials say today’s incident will not affect this schedule. All of this comes at a time when South Korea and the United States are increasingly concerned about the deepening military alliance between North Korea and Russia. Against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine, North Korea has emerged as a key backer for Moscow, providing troops as well as millions of rounds of ammunition and other weaponry. According to South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), the Freedom Shield drills will reflect 'lessons learned from recent armed conflicts' and North Korea’s expanding partnership with Russia.

Photo by Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images Chung Sung-Jun Incidents involving live-fire exercises in South Korea are also not unheard of. During a joint U.S.-South Korea drill in 2022, a short-range ballistic missile was launched and malfunctioned, crashing into a golf course at a military base. The warhead didn’t detonate, but there was a significant fire. On other occasions, stray munitions have landed near civilian residences in South Korea but have rarely caused injuries. In 2004, a ROKAF F-5B mistakenly released a practice bomb over Boryeong, 85 miles south of Seoul, but no one was harmed. In this latest case, it is especially alarming since these were live weapons — a full 4,000 pounds nominal weight in total — that detonated in a city with a population of around 140,000. There is also the fact that this occurred in close proximity to the North Korean border. Certainly, the results could have been much worse in terms of both civilian casualties and repercussions. While the South Korean military insists that today’s incident will not affect the Freedom Shield drills, it will undoubtedly raise questions about the relative safety of live-fire exercises on the peninsula. In that sense, the timing is especially unfortunate for Seoul, as it prepares to begin the first large-scale joint maneuvers with the U.S. military under the new Trump administration, at a time of raised tensions with the North.

USAF Generals Downplay Calls For More Hardened Aircraft Shelters ...	U.S. Air Force officials remain focused on the ability to disperse forces to far-flung operating locations as the primary means of reducing vulnerability to enemy attacks. They also continue to downplay any talk of doing more to physically harden existing bases. This is despite acknowledgments that large established facilities are still expected to play key roles in any future conflict and can no longer be considered sanctuaries. All of this comes amid an increasingly heated debate about whether the entire U.S. military should be investing in new hardened aircraft shelters and other similar infrastructure improvements, which TWZ has been following closely. Air Force Gen. Kevin Schneider, head of Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), the service's top command in the Indo-Pacific region, spoke yesterday about current 'resilient' basing priorities during a panel discussion at the Air & Space Forces Association’s (AFA) 2025 Warfare Symposium, at which TWZ was in attendance. The panel's main topic was Agile Combat Employment (ACE), a term that currently refers to a set of concepts for distributed and disaggregated operations centered heavily on short notice and otherwise irregular deployments, often to remote, austere, or otherwise non-traditional locales. The other branches of the U.S. military, especially the U.S. Marine Corps, have been developing similar new concepts of operations. 'So the Air Force wants to populate the Indo-Pacific with dispersed operating locations to support ACE. However, the Air Force also needs to invest heavily in resilient infrastructure at its main operating bases,' Heather 'Lucky' Penney, the panel's moderator, said as a lead in to a question. 'So, General Schneider, could you speak to what the Air Force is doing to balance the demand for resilient infrastructure while also building out ACE operating locations across the Indo-Pacific?' Penney is currently a senior fellow at AFA's Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies and also an Air Force veteran who flew F-16s. 'It's different in the Indo-Pacific than it is in Europe. [We] do not have NATO. You have a couple of – five bilateral treaty partners. Two of them are Korea and Japan where we share basing,' Schneider said in response. 'We also have the joint force demands on our bases. And their are benefits to that, as well. I like having the Army on our bases, especially when they have Patriots [surface-to-air missile systems] and other capability that helps us defend.' Elements of a US Army Patriot surface-to-air missile battery at Osan Air Base in South Korea, which the Air Force also operates from. US Army It's worth noting here that currently the U.S. Army is the lead service for providing air and missile defense for Air Force bases at home and abroad. There has been talk recently about the Air Force potentially taking a greater role in this regard. The Army has been facing its own struggles in meeting growing demand for ground-based air and missile defenses. 'So, we will have the need for bases, the main operating bases from which we operate,' the PACAF commander continued. 'The challenge becomes, at some point, we will need to move to austere locations. We will need to disaggregate the force. We will need to operate out of other locations, again, one for survivability, and two, again, to provide response options.' Ensuring the continued viability of main operating bases and work related to ACE both 'cost money,' he said. The Air Force is then faced with the need to 'make internal trades' funding-wise, such as 'do we put that dollar towards, you know, fixing the infrastructure at Kadena [Air Base in Japan] or do we put that dollar towards restoring an airfield at Tinian,' according to Schneider. What Gen. Schneider was referring to at the end here is the massive amount of work that has been done to reclaim North Field on the island of Tinian, a U.S. territory in the Western Pacific, since the end of 2023. North Field was originally built as a huge B-29 bomber base during World War II. It was the biggest active airbase anywhere in the world before being largely abandoned after the war ended. There has also been additional expansion of the available facilities at Tinian International Airport in recent years, ostensibly to improve its ability to serve as a divert location for U.S. military aircraft in the event that the critically strategic Andersen Air Force Base on nearby Guam is rendered unusable for any reason.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION North Field is a prime example of the Air Force's current focus on ACE as the centerpiece of how it expects to fight in the future, especially in a high-end fight in the Pacific. The airfield's grid-like layout inherently presents additional targeting challenges for a potential adversary like China, as you can read about in more detail in TWZ's recent story on what has been happening over the past year or so on Tinian. Guam has also seen significant military construction work in recent years, including to refurbish more of the World War II-era Northwest Field on the island to support ACE operations. Guam is now set to get a huge new air and missile defense architecture full of new surface-to-air missile launchers, radars, and other supporting facilities, as you can read more about here.

Missile Defense Agency A map showing radar arcs and other details giving a sense of the size and scope of the current plans for the new air and missile defense architecture on Guam. Missile Defense Agency 'These are the things that we need in our main operating bases. These are the things that we need to project power,' Gen. Schneider added, but did not explicitly mention hardened infrastructure. He also emphasized a desire to work more with regional allies and partners to 'gain greater access to those fields that are already in operating condition.' Air Force Gen. James Hecker, another member of yesterday's ACE panel at the AFA Warfare Symposium, also stressed the continued importance of existing main operating bases. Hecker, who is head of U.S. Air Forces in Europe and Air Forces Africa (USAFE-AFAFRICA), as well as NATO's Allied Air Command, highlighted significant challenges his service faces in successfully executing large-scale dispersed operations in the future, as well. 'I have the opportunity to talk to the Ukrainian air chief once every two weeks, or so. And they've been very successful not getting their aircraft hit on the ground,' Hecker said. 'And I ask him, I said, 'How is that? What do you do?' And he goes, 'Well, we never take off and land at the same airfield. I'm like, okay, you know, that's pretty good. Keeps the Russians on their toes.' 'I got tons of airfields from tons of allies, and we have access to all of them. The problem is, I can only protect a few of them,' he continued. 'We can't have that layered [defensive] effect for thousands of airbases. There's just no way it's going to happen.'

Hecker warned that just dispersing forces to more bases will not be a solution in of itself, either. 'So, to go think you're going to land at another airfield and hang out there for a week with no defense, you're going to get schwacked. It's going to happen,' he said. 'You can only stay there for a little bit, and then you've got to get back to your main operating bases.' 'It's going to be much shorter operations. You know, we're not talking weeks anymore,' Hecker explained. 'We're talking days, and sometimes we're talking hours, if you want to be survivable. And then back at your main operating base, you've got the layered defense.' Hecker called attention to how shrinking adversary kill chains are a key driving factor here, specifically highlighting Russia's efforts to reduce the total time it takes to complete a targeting cycle in operations in Ukraine. China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) has been doing the same, particularly with the help of a growing array of space-based surveillance assets. The time it takes from certain munitions like ballistic and hypersonic missiles to actually get to their targets after launch can also be very short. 'So it's really evolving the ACE concept,' the Air Force's top officer in Europe noted. Realities like the ones Hecker outlined are exactly what has been driving increasing criticism of the Air Force's current focus on ACE, as well as the service's general approach to basing and base defense, including from members of Congress and outside experts. Just in January, the Hudson Institute think tank in Washington, D.C., published a report warning that a lack of hardened and unhardened aircraft shelters, as well as other exposed infrastructure, at bases across the Pacific and elsewhere globally has left the U.S. military worryingly vulnerable. The report's authors assessed that just 10 missiles with warheads capable of scattering cluster munitions across areas 450 feet in diameter could be sufficient to neutralize all aircraft parked in the open and critical fuel storage facilities at key airbases like Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni in Japan, Naval Support Facility Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, or Langley Air Force Base in Virginia. Hudson Institute Another report that the Henry L. Stimson Center think tank published last December highlighted how Chinese missile strikes aimed just at cratering runways at bases in the Pacific could upend the U.S. military's ability to project airpower. 'While ‘active defenses’ such as air and missile defense systems are an important part of base and force protection, their high cost and limited numbers mean the U.S. will not be able to deploy enough of them to fully protect our bases,' a group of 13 Republican members of Congress wrote in an open letter to the Air Force back in May 2024. 'In order to complement active defenses and strengthen our bases, we must invest in ‘passive defenses,’ like hardened aircraft shelters… Robust passive defenses can help minimize the damage of missile attacks by increasing our forces’ ability to withstand strikes, recover quickly, and effectively continue operations.' 'While hardened aircraft shelters do not provide complete protection from missile attacks, they do offer significantly more protection against submunitions than expedient shelters (relocatable steel shelters),' the letter’s authors added. More shelters 'would also force China to use more force to destroy each aircraft, thereby increasing the resources required to attack our forces and, in turn, the survivability of our valuable air assets.' Outside of the United States, especially in China, but also in Russia, North Korea, and many other countries, there has been a growing trend in the expansion of hardened and otherwise more robust airbase infrastructure.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Air Force officials have also pushed back more actively on the idea of investing in additional physical hardening in recent years. 'I’m not a big fan of hardening infrastructure,' Gen. Kenneth Wilsbach said at a roundtable at the Air and Space Forces Association's main annual symposium in 2023. 'The reason is because of the advent of precision-guided weapons… you saw what we did to the Iraqi Air Force and their hardened aircraft shelters. They’re not so hard when you put a 2,000-pound bomb right through the roof.' Wilsbach was commander of PACAF at the time and has since become head of Air Combat Command (ACC), which oversees the vast majority of the Air Force's tactical combat jets and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft. The comments yesterday from the Air Force's current top officers in the Indo-Pacific region and Europe highlighting the continued focus on ACE and the challenges with that strategy are only likely to further fuel the ongoing debate about building more hardened infrastructure to help ensure American forces can continue to project air power in future fights.

F-15’s New EPAWSS Electronic Warfare Suite Already Has Successor ...	The F-15E’s Eagle Passive/Active Warning Survivability System, or EPAWSS, may only just have been issued to frontline units, but BAE Systems is already working on a new iteration of the radar warning and electronic warfare suite. The new EPAWSSv2 has not yet been flown, but the manufacturer is confident that its improved processing power and ability to handle a greater number of threats — coupled with other undisclosed improvements — will be of interest to Eagle operators, including the U.S. Air Force. Speaking to TWZ at the Air & Space Forces Association’s 2025 Warfare Symposium, Lindsay Gallagher, Product Line Director, TacAir EW at BAE Systems, confirmed that the EPAWSS V2 is headed into its critical design review (CDR) before the end of this month but has not yet been flown. CDR is a technical review that ensures the design is mature enough to move forward into manufacturing and flight testing. A U.S. Air Force F-15E arrives at RAF Lakenheath, England, on January 15, 2025, after being equipped with the baseline version of EPAWSS. U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Seleena Muhammad-Ali Gallagher explained that the V2 version of the system emerged as the company — together with Boeing — worked through the normal life cycle of the baseline EPWASS. 'You have obsolescence issues,' she said, 'and through that process, we’ve been able to make some improvements to the system, which we are now calling EPAWSSv2.' BAE Systems has revealed very few details about EPAWSSv2, but Gallagher confirmed that it encompasses both software and hardware changes. 'I can say that the biggest thing to note is the processing power,' Gallagher continued. 'This gives us the ability to handle future threats. We’re very in tune with them, and so we’re trying to stay ahead of them.' Compared to the baseline version, EPAWSSv2 will do 'everything a bit quicker,' Gallagher said, and will also be able to handle more threats simultaneously.

U.S. Air Force/1st Lt Savanah Bray In the past, BAE Systems has also suggested that future upgrades to EPAWSS could include a fiber-optic towed decoy, although it’s unclear if this is part of EPAWSSv2. Other potential enhancements that the company has alluded to in the past include 'expansion of frequency coverage and cognitive electronic warfare processing.' The latter capability, which we have discussed in depth in the past, would allow the system to identify previously unknown threat signals not in the system’s threat library and potentially create a countermeasure response to them on the fly. Gallagher noted that at least some of the software improvements that come with EPAWSSv2 could potentially be applicable to the baseline system. However, EPAWSS V2 primarily exists as a retrofit option for existing F-15 operators as well as a new-fit option for any new Eagle customers. Presently, BAE Systems is under contract to produce the baseline EPAWSS for the U.S. Air Force, for retrofit in the F-15E and for installation in the new-build F-15EX Eagle II. The company is also building the baseline system for Japan for the F-15J Japan Super Interceptor (JSI) upgrade program. Concept artwork of the F-15J Japan Super Interceptor (JSI). Boeing Gallagher said that the BAE Systems is not currently talking to the U.S. Air Force about EPAWSSv2, but this is very much an aspiration. She also confirmed that the company is talking to other F-15 operators around the world who might be looking to swap out their comparatively archaic Tactical Electronic Warfare System (TEWS) and upgrade to the new EPAWSS V2. News of EPAWSSv2 broke last month, but it had remained very low-profile until now. In February, Rob Novotny, Boeing’s executive director for F-15 business development, took to social media site X after a visit to BAE Systems. 'Great day in Nashua, NH, with our BAE Systems Inc. teammates talking EPAWSS and &#8230; EPAWSSv2!,' Novotny wrote. A reference to EPAWSSv2 also surfaced last month when BAE Systems mentioned it in a job advertisement that was looking for a 'senior TacAir product line test lead.' As for the original baseline EPAWSS, also known as the AN/ALQ-250, it began to be developed around a decade ago to replace the previous AN/ALQ-135 TEWS. The earlier suite had comprised three separate subcomponents: a radar warning receiver, a countermeasures controller, and a countermeasure dispenser. EPAWSS brings all of these functions together in the same system, which offers enhanced performance and is also integrated with the Raytheon AN/APG-82 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar. Altogether, this provides a major boost to the F-15E’s survivability. However, actually getting the baseline EPAWSS into operational service has taken a long time. As we reported at the time, the first operational F-15Es equipped with EPAWSS were delivered to the 48th Fighter Wing at RAF Lakenheath in England on January 15. The jets in question received the upgrade from BAE Systems in San Antonio, Texas.

Gen. Jason Voorheis, program executive officer for the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center’s Fighters and Advanced Aircraft Directorate, admitted, 'but this system is vital to our 21st-century fighter force structure. Not only does this system keep our most lethal fighter in the modern fight, [but] it’s an incredible deterrent in our Great Power Competition initiative.' Designed to sample the electromagnetic spectrum, identify threats, prioritize, and allocate jamming resources against them, the baseline EPAWSS is described by its manufacturer as follows: 'Providing both offensive and defensive electronic warfare options for the pilot and aircraft, EPAWSS offers fully integrated radar warning, geolocation, situational awareness, and self-protection solutions to detect and defeat surface and airborne threats in signal-dense contested and highly contested environments. Equipped with advanced electronic countermeasures, it enables deeper penetration against modern integrated air defense systems, providing rapid response capabilities to protect the aircrew.' An F-15E suspended from the ceiling at the Benefield Anechoic Facility during its first phase of testing of the baseline EPAWSS at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on May 8, 2019. U.S. Air Force/Ethan 'Evac' Wagner In the past, TWZ has also outlined how the original EPAWSS enhances the survivability of the F-15E in an operational scenario: 'EPAWSS ensures the Strike Eagle aircrew receives timely and accurate warnings of ground-based and airborne radio-frequency (RF) threats, including their specific type and location. With this enhanced situational awareness, the crew is much better able to avoid, engage, or negate the threat. As well as alerting the crew to the threats as a defensive system, EPAWSS is able to target these threats offensively, employing countermeasures and providing targeting for effectors. The system can also be used to detect and counter incoming infrared threats, but the F-15Es do not appear to have the missile approach warning systems (MAWS) detectors installed at this time, which would help significantly in this regard. In particular, the nature of the air defense threat has changed hugely since TEWS, which was developed based on analog technology from the 1970s. The kinds of high-end surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) that are proliferating now provide challenges to allied airpower that are far beyond what was in service with the primary Warsaw Pact adversary when the F-15E first entered service in the second half of the 1980s. But even since work on the baseline EPAWSS began, there have been further advances in the air defense threat, and the electromagnetic spectrum has become increasingly contested. This is especially the case for China and Russia, widely seen as the most likely high-end adversaries in any future conflict. A U.S. Air Force F-15E from RAF Lakenheath’s 494th Fighter Squadron returns to formation after receiving fuel over the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility on May 2, 2024. U.S. Air Force Photo/Staff Sgt. Devin Rumbaugh Typical air defense systems now fielded by these countries include very long-range missiles, active electronically scanned array (AESA) technology, counter-jamming capabilities, and a significant degree of mobility, making them hard to target. Perhaps most significantly, these systems can be woven together, with many different sensor types now being networked across a battlespace as part of an integrated air defense system (IADS). At the same time, weapons in this class are also becoming increasingly available to lower-tier adversaries. Clearly, the rapidly changing nature of the threat has driven BAE Systems to develop a new iteration of EPAWSS, although it’s worth noting that even the baseline system, with its open-architecture design, is intended to be rapidly updated to keep pace with the developing air defense threat. 'EPAWSS is a line update item, it’s one of those things that we just need to get the appropriate data and maintenance to load updated information,' Maj. Aaron 'Kamikazze' Eshkenazi of the 85th Test and Evaluation Squadron at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, explained to TWZ in a previous interview. A pilot and WSO from the 85th Test and Evaluation Squadron at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. Jamie Hunter There is even the possibility that the baseline EPWASS can be configured to meet new threats in near real-time in the future, something you can read more about here. Regardless, despite the undoubted capabilities of the baseline system, its manufacturer has determined that more can be done to protect the F-15 against new and emerging air defense threats. In the past, we have also examined how EPAWSS might become a very valuable tool for the integration of Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones and launched effects. The same capabilities it brings in terms of self-defense and situational awareness could be harnessed to provide the pilot with intelligence on where companion drones and launched effects should be best deployed. It’s certainly conceivable that the EPAWSSv2 will be even more applicable for this mission, thanks to its improved command over the electromagnetic battlespace. While BAE Systems appears to have earmarked the U.S. Air Force as the target customer for EPAWSSv2, it’s worth noting that there is still some uncertainty about the future size of the F-15E fleet. Before the arrival of EPAWSS, the F-15E relied on the obsolescent AN/ALQ-135 Tactical Electronic Warfare System (TEWS) for electronic warfare self-protection. U.S. Air Force/Senior Master Sgt. Ralph Branson Currently, the Air Force has 218 F-15Es in its inventory. Of those aircraft, 119 are powered by Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-220 turbofan engines that produce some 23,500 pounds of thrust each. The other 99 have the significantly more powerful F100-PW-229s, each rated at 29,000 pounds of thrust. The Air Force had planned to retire all of the F-15Es with the -220 engines, which are also older overall, by the end of Fiscal Year 2028. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 blocked the Air Force from retiring more than 68 F-15Es before the end of Fiscal Year 2029. Previously, it was reported that 99 F-15Es (those with F100-PW-229 engines) would get EPAWSS, but the new legislation could potentially see the number increase. However, with F-15Es upgraded with the baseline EPWASS only starting to trickle back into the operational inventory, the F-15EX might be a more obvious target for the EPAWSSv2, especially considering this platform’s growing relevance for a future high-end conflict in the Indo-Pacific theater, where electronic warfare self-protection would be at an absolute premium. Furthermore, the capabilities offered by EPAWSSv2 would be further enhanced by the large-area display in the Eagle II. A U.S. Air Force F-15EX Eagle II armed with 12 AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles. U.S. Air Force USAF/SSgt Blake Wiles Overall, at this early stage, the F-15EX appears to be excelling, with a glowing recent test report highlighting its performance in simulated combat, even against fifth-generation threats. On the other hand, the same report notes that new enemy long-range missiles could prove a challenge. EPAWSSv2 could also help mitigate that threat. Currently, the F-15EX is receiving the baseline EPWASS as it comes off the Boeing production line. However, F-15EX fleet numbers have been reduced from the original plan for at least 144 aircraft to what is now expected to be only 98 aircraft. With that in mind, it makes sense that BAE Systems is also targeting export F-15 operators. While Japan has signed up for the baseline EPWASS already, other international Eagle operators could be interested in EPAWSSv2. In addition to Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and South Korea, Israel would appear to be a prime candidate for EPAWSSv2. As well as its existing fleet of F-15I Ra’am aircraft, which are at the forefront of its long-range strike operations, Israel has also signed up for 25 F-15IA versions, a derivative of the Advanced Eagle. Traditionally, Israel has incorporated certain locally produced electronic warfare systems in its F-15s, but the EPAWSSv2 could well be of interest. With the current security situation in the Middle East, further Israeli acquisitions of combat aircraft — potentially also F-15s — are likely. Israel will buy 25 new F-15IA fighters, seen here in Boeing concept art. Boeing Boeing Furthermore, Indonesia plans to buy up to 24 Advanced Eagles, and the aircraft has also recently been pitched fairly aggressively toward Poland. Suffice it to say, the future of the F-15 looks secure, with new orders still coming in and with existing fleets set to serve for many decades to come. At the same time, the rapidly evolving nature of the air defense threat means that new electronic warfare self-protection capabilities are likely to not just be attractive but outright necessary for current and future F-15 fleets.

Lockheed’s Low-Cost Cruise Missile ‘Truck’ Is Now In Testing	Lockheed Martin has revealed more about its Common Multi-Mission Truck (CMMT, pronounced ‘comet’), a revised design based on its Speed Racer air vehicle concept, a missile-shaped uncrewed system you can read more about here. The CMMT is now said to be a family of systems, intended to yield low-cost subsonic air vehicles designed for a wide range of missions and for launch from both air and ground platforms. The ethos is very much in keeping with an ongoing U.S. Air Force push for cheaper, easier-to-produce munitions that has been accelerated by the realities of the current stockpile and its limited depth. Lockheed is currently pitching CMMT in two basic configurations. The first is a missile that will be deployed via U.S. Air Force fighters, bombers, and transports. Concept artwork this week by Lockheed Martin shows CMMTs being launched from a C-130 series airlifter (as seen at the top of this story) and from an F-16 fighter. The second configuration is for a smaller long-range launched effect that will be deployed from rotary-wing platforms — the related concept artwork shows an H-60 Black Hawk series helicopter. A head-on view of the CMMT in flight. Lockheed Martin At the 2025 Air & Space Forces Association (AFA) Warfare Symposium today, Lockheed Martin also showed concept artwork of a ground-launched version of CMMT, with an example being fired from an M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) using one of its rocket pods. This version is apparently based on the second configuration of CMTT, but it’s fitted with a supplementary booster for launching. A rendering of a ground-launched CMMT, fired from a HIMARS launcher. Lockheed Martin As for the air-launched version of the larger CMMT, Mike Rothstein, Vice President of Strategy and Requirements, Air Weapons and Sensors at Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control said at the AFA Warfare Symposium today that a potential palletized scenario could involve as many as 25 CMMTs. This compares with the nine palletized JASSM missiles used in Rapid Dragon, a previous experimental effort that armed airlifters with cruise missiles but which is, broadly speaking, conceptually similar to CMMT. An official Air Force model showing a Rapid Dragon pallet loaded with nine missiles. Joseph Trevithick Rothstein confirmed that, over the last weekend, the company completed a CMMT drop test, making use of the latest iteration of Rapid Dragon to test the new store in what he described as 'more of a lab test,' involving a common pallet dropped under a parachute. This will be followed up by a planned free flight test of CMMT later this year, Rothstein said. Lockheed Martin has recently also released more details about the development path for CMMT — which it says is 'highly adaptable and affordable' and which 'can be produced and delivered as fast as it is expended.' The ability to produce munitions at scale is something that is increasingly seen as a key requirement by the U.S. military. To try and meet this demand, Lockheed Martin says it benefited from 1LMX — a program to 're-engineer its internal processes.' Two images showing the rapid prototyping effort for the CMMT program. Lockheed Martin 1LMX is said to be the largest internal program ever undertaken by the company and is focused on 'automations and capabilities required to drive efficiency, increase velocity, and enhance … key captures and programs.' One of the first programs to leverage 1LMX was Rapid Dragon, another Air Force initiative in keeping with the Pentagon’s doctrine of ‘affordable mass.’ Lockheed Martin and the Air Force started work on Rapid Dragon in early 2021 and, within the first 10 months, had conducted three customer exercises and a first flight. Rapid Dragon went on to yield four live-fire strike missions from airlifters, two in the United States and two abroad. As Lockheed Martin was preparing Rapid Dragon for fielding, the company was also 'developing affordable mass weapons to support the Air Force mission —and a few others.' This includes CMMT, which Lockheed Martin says is chiefly a manufacturing program rather than a technology development effort. As such, the aim was to drastically reduce the normal development path, producing a low-cost design that was '100 percent producible from the start.' Once a scalable product is achieved, 'performance-enhancing and mission-specific capabilities' will be introduced later 'as use cases and threats emerge.' CMMT has an open architecture and modular design. This means it can be manufactured using distributed supply chains and production lines that can surge to meet customer demands. At the same time, new capabilities can be easily added as required. For this reason, too, Lockheed Martin typically refers to CMMT not as a missile but as an air vehicle since it can be fitted with different types of sensors as well as a warhead. Potentially, it could also be easily adapted as an air-launched decoy. A screengrab from an earlier Skunk Works video shows notional payloads inside the front end of a CMMT drone. Antennas or RF-transparent apertures or glazed low-observable ‘windows’ for electro-optics are shown on the side and bottom of the forward fuselage. Lockheed Martin Skunk Works capture By utilizing 1LMX, Lockheed Martin was able to reduce the time required to get CMMT to a preliminary design review by 50 percent, the company says. At the same time, as mentioned, CMMT is not an all-new design, since it also draws from the earlier Speed Racer. A product of Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works advanced projects division, this was an experimental low-cost 'pathfinder' design that was developed first to demonstrate new digital engineering and advanced manufacturing methods — techniques that were also rolled into 1LMX. Like CMMT, Speed Racer was based around a modular architecture that allowed it to be relatively readily reconfigured for different mission sets. Speed Racer was also designed to be a low-cost vehicle, with a planned unit cost significantly under $2 million, and was not intended to be recovered after a mission. The older Lockheed Martin video below includes a rendering of the Speed Racer experimental vehicle, as seen in the thumbnail. Back in July 2022, Lockheed Martin unveiled four distinct uncrewed aircraft designs, one of which was CMMT, with Speed Racer being disclosed as the basis for it. An official project video released by Lockheed Martin depicted an F-35 launching a future CMMT from a wing pylon, a mode of employment that would negatively impact the jet’s stealthy characteristics. CMMTs seen in an earlier rendering with single offset air intakes and V-shaped tail assemblies. Lockheed Martin Skunk Works Meanwhile, other similar designs have emerged, and it’s notable that the current CMMT looks quite similar to Anduril’s Barracuda, a new family of what that company is calling 'expendable autonomous air vehicles' that are scalable, highly modular, and already being flight-tested. However, Barracuda is just one of an increasing number of cheaper cruise missiles now in the works, and this is an area that has attracted particular interest from smaller firms, including some brand-new players.

At the forefront of this is the Pentagon’s Replicator initiative, which is accelerating work on low-cost air vehicles that could evolve into relatively cheap cruise missiles. 'As we envision the environment that we have to work in, we understand that in a global conflict, and the kind of conflict we’re going to have, maybe against a peer competitor, being able to get mass on targets is important,' Rothstein said. 'We know we got to be able to produce at more rate,' Rothstein continued. 'And we know we have to work not only with some of the exquisite high-end weapons that we do so well, such as JASSM and LRASM, but we are also listening and understanding that there’s a need to bring more affordable mass to that target. Think of [CMMT] like a low-cost cruise missile.' Artwork showing the general configuration of the CMMT, with its pop-out wings deployed. Lockheed Martin With a genesis that dates back several years, and with the experience of the Speed Racer and Rapid Dragon, Lockheed Martin will hope that its CMMT is well positioned for future success — especially the scalable mass production that is a central tenet of its design.

MQ-20 Avenger Tests ‘Hivemind’ AI In Orange Flag Exercise	General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. (GA-ASI), has revealed that its jet-powered MQ-20 Avenger drone, equipped with U.S. government-provided autonomy software, took part in a recent Orange Flag large force test exercise. This is the latest milestone for the Avenger, which has been heavily involved in the testing of different artificial-intelligence-driven autonomy systems for several years now. GA-ASI announced today that one of two company-owned MQ-20s, with the so-called 'reference autonomy stack' software, flew in a demonstration at Orange Flag 25-1, which took place at Edwards Air Force Base, California, from February 19-21. You can read more about the Orange Flag series, which is focused on developmental test activities, in this previous article.

Photo courtesy of General Atomics Air Force Test Center Once integrated in the MQ-20, Shield AI’s reference autonomy stack — which included a pilot vehicle interface (PVI) — demonstrated autonomous flight operation, with a focus on air-to-air engagements. 'The government-provided PVI enabled seamless control and monitoring of the autonomy stack, highlighting the interoperability and flexibility of GA-ASI’s UCAV ecosystem,' the company said in a statement. 'The Shield AI stack demonstrated autonomy skills for safe administrative phases of flight.' 'This demonstration marks a significant achievement in our ongoing efforts to operationalize autonomy for UCAVs,' added GA-ASI Vice President of Advanced Programs Michael Atwood. 'Flying the government reference autonomy stack at Orange Flag 25-1 and utilizing the government-provided PVI underscores our commitment to delivering robust and adaptable autonomy solutions for the warfighter.' An important part of the demonstration was to prove that the MQ-20 — and, by extension, other GA-ASI drones — can be rapidly reconfigured from using company-written software to government-provided or other vendors’ software as required. This has important implications in terms of flexibility for future drones once in service, so they can receive new software — enabling new capabilities and/or enhanced interoperability — very rapidly. Speaking to TWZ at the Air & Space Forces Association’s 2025 Warfare Symposium, a spokesperson from Shield AI said that the process of integrating the reference autonomy stack in the MQ-20 took 'about three weeks.' A picture of a drone control system using a tablet-like device that General Atomics has previously released. GA-ASI The demonstration also showed that the MQ-20 can rapidly swap between autonomy systems mid-flight, as C. Mark Brinkley, a General Atomics spokesman, explained to TWZ. 'During Orange Flag, we were able to fly both a government [AI] architecture as well as sort of mid-flight switch over to the Shield AI software and let that software take over.' Brinkley also told TWZ why he considers the MQ-20 an ideal platform for these kinds of tests, which are intended to feed into the Air Force’s Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) program. 'The interesting thing about MQ-20 is it’s sort of still ahead of its time as far as jet UCAVs goes. We continue to use it as a CCA surrogate, and I suspect we will continue to do that for some time. We have two company aircraft that we own and can fly and use whenever we want. The ability to use the MQ-20 the way that you would a CCA in terms of loading on software, experimenting with autonomy actions, experimenting with different types of missions, like we did in Orange Flag, and then be able to take all that data off of a real airplane, and go back into the virtual world and make changes as necessary, it’s really been a game-changer for our ability to move that forward.' 'For us, it’s really using an aircraft that exists,' Brinkley added. 'We don’t have to wait until there are some new aircraft. I mean, we’re building our CCA. We have plenty of aircraft out there. Having two company-owned MQ-20s, you might look at them and say, ‘Well, that’s too big for what the CCA program might be, they might cost too much. It’s not exactly what you’re looking for.’ That’s fine. But in terms of trying to get to autonomy and autonomous flight and autonomous missions, you can do a lot of it in the virtual environment, but really having a real aircraft to team with them has been unique for us.' In the context of the MQ-20 demonstration at Orange Flag, the drone’s reference autonomy stack was a product of Shield AI, a relatively new by fast-moving aerospace company that you can read more about here. The stack is referred to by that company as Hivemind Enterprise. Shield AI’s original Hivemind was an ‘AI pilot’ that has been used in real-world fighter aircraft test flights linked to advanced U.S. Air Force programs, as well as to control a host of Kratos drones and in Shield AI’s own MQ-35 V-BAT drone. Hivemind is also expected to feed into the Air Force’s emerging Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) program. A V-BAT is prepared for flight onboard the destroyer USS Michael Monsoor (DDG-1001) during Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) 2022. U.S. Navy In the words of Shield AI’s co-founder, president, and chief growth officer Brandon Tseng, Hivemind 'enables aircraft to accomplish missions fully autonomously without GPS, without communications, without a remote pilot. What do I mean by fully autonomous mission execution? In the example of our NOVA quadcopter, it would go inside buildings, and it would find threats, it would map out the building, it would clear the building all by itself without anybody piloting it. GPS didn’t matter, communications didn’t matter, it would accomplish the mission.' The NOVA 2 quadcopter, which features Hivemind. Shield AI From the start, Hivemind was intended as a core central system within an aircraft and one that can be leveraged across many different platforms. In this way, Hivemind first began to be installed in small quadcopters and then in increasingly more complex drones, all the way up to the MQ-20, as well as crewed surrogate aircraft. In addition to providing ‘self-piloting’ technology for aircraft, Hivemind enables cooperative teaming and swarming. Using Hivemind AI, a group of drones can execute a mission, working together dynamically, reading and reacting to each other, to the battlefield, to the adversarial threats, and so on. This can be accomplished at computer speeds. Hivemind is designed to be agnostic to the original equipment manufacturer, and the company has said in the past that it wants the AI technology 'to fly on every single CCA.' However, Hivemind is just one of a number of AI agents that has been flown in the MQ-20. 'We’ve proven that we’ve been able to fly a lot of different autonomy engines and autonomy pilots in the aircraft,' Brinkley adds. 'It’s flown Skyborg, it’s flown the DARPA CODE engine. It’s flown our own AI.' Brinkley is also cognizant of the fact that AI software from more than one supplier might find its way into the CCA program and into other GA-ASI drones. 'With software, it’s not a winner-take-all kind of game. Just like when you take your phone out and you’re running an operating system on your phone, but you and I might have different maps, we might have different email programs, we might have different games that we play or whatever. There’s not going to be just one way to do this. Across the services, across different nations, they may all want to do things differently.' Whoever provides it, AI will be especially important to achieving the Air Force’s ambition for crewed-uncrewed teaming, including having fighters, like the F-35, operate as inflight ‘quarterbacks’ for these advanced drones. For the Air Force, how pilots in crewed aircraft will actually manage CCAs during operations has emerged as an increasingly important question and has already yielded related trials, as you can read about here. The Air Force is also still very much in the process of developing new concepts of operations and tactics, techniques, and procedures for employing CCA drones operationally. How the drones will fit into the service’s force structure and be utilized in routine training and other day-to-day peacetime activities, along with what the maintenance and logistical demands will be, also remains to be seen. Questions about in-flight command and control have emerged as particularly important ones to answer in the near term. Models of the drones General Atomics (at top) and Anduril (at bottom) are developing as part of the CCA program’s Increment 1. General Atomics/Jamie Hunter The latest edition of the Orange Flag test exercise further underlines the importance of the MQ-20 as a testbed for future autonomous collaborative platforms and adds yet another platform to the growing roster that is using different iterations of Shield AI’s Hivemind AI technology.

Next Generation Fighter Critical To Future Air Superiority Key US...	A deep review of the U.S. Air Force's paused plans to acquire a new crewed sixth-generation stealth combat jet came to the unambiguous conclusion that the service needs such an aircraft to be best positioned to achieve air superiority in future high-end fights. The same analyses further reinforced the view that establishing air superiority will remain central to winning those same conflicts. A panel of senior U.S. Air Force officers discussed what is commonly called the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) combat jet, as well as the future of air superiority operations more broadly, at the Air & Space Forces Association’s (AFA) 2025 Warfare Symposium earlier today. 'Many of you know, we put a pause on NGAD, and we put a pause on NGAD to reflect, and we did a study on it,' Air Force Maj. Gen. Joseph Kunkel said early on in the panel. Kunkel is currently director of Force Design, Integration, and Wargaming within the office of the deputy chief of staff for Air Force Futures at the service’s top headquarters at the Pentagon. A rendering of a notional sixth-generation crewed stealth combat jet. Collins Aerospace 'With that study, we asked ourselves some hard questions,' he continued. 'Is air superiority dead? What does air superiority look like in the future? Does the joint force need air superiority? And what we found is, not only in the past, not only the present, but in the future, air superiority matters.' 'We tried a whole bunch of different options, and there was no more vital option than NGAD to achieve air superiority in this highly contested environment,' Kunkel added. This is fully in line with comments that Maj. Gen. Kunkel made at a separate event that the Hudson Institute think tank hosted last week, which TWZ covered at the time. Envisioned ostensibly as a successor to the F-22 Raptor stealth fighter, the NGAD combat jet requirements, at least as existed prior to the review, are understood to call for a relatively large, high-performance, and long-range design. The NGAD aircraft has also long been expected to feature a very high level of broadband low-observability (stealthiness) together with an array of advanced sensor, networking, electronic warfare, and other capabilities. All of that has been expected to come at considerable cost, with former Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall saying in January that it would take at least approximately $20 billion to finish the developmental stage of the program. Serial production of the jets, which cost upwards of $300 million apiece, would add tens of billions more to the overall price tag. A pair of F-22 Raptors. USAF The alternatives to the NGAD combat jet that the Air Force is known to have explored include a truncated, lower-cost aircraft intended primarily to serve as an airborne drone controller. The service also considered a force-wide shift in focus away from air superiority to longer-range, standoff strike capabilities like those the B-21 Raider stealth bomber will provide. Kunkel and the other Air Force officers on today's panel stressed that NGAD is just one part of the bigger and more critical matter of how to effectively provide air superiority in future major conflicts, such as one in the Pacific against China. 'The entire joint force counts on air superiority. So, anything else you want to do in the battle space, if you don't have air superiority, it becomes much more difficult, if not impossible,' Gen. Kenneth Wilsbach, head of Air Combat Command (ACC), another one of the panelists, said. 'So, if we want to collect intelligence, if we want to do casualty evacuation, if we want to drop some bombs, if you want to sail some ships around, or if you want to have some ground maneuver, if you don't have air and space superiority, you will not be able to or you will have a very difficult time achieving any of those other objectives.' 'There's been some talk in the public about [how] the age of air superiority is over,' Wilsbach continued. 'I categorically reject that and maintain that it's the first building block of any other military operation.' Wilsbach cited the emergence of two previously unseen Chinese stealth combat jets this past December as further evidence that air superiority is not dead and that America's chief competitor believes it to be similarly critical for success in future conflicts. The two Chinese stealth aircraft 'we believe are for air superiority,' Wilsbach said. 'As we observe what China has produced, and we can presume we know what that's for, for air superiority, what are we going to do about it? And I don't believe that nothing is an option.'

'We're making this transition from a platform-centric Air Force to a system-centric Air Force,' Gen. Kunkel said. 'And as kill chains get longer and longer,&#8230; we need to think about how are we trying to do that whole system.' Chief of Staff of the Air Force Gen. David Allvin made similar remarks during a keynote speech at the AFA Warfare Symposium yesterday evening. 'We’re looking at different ways to execute the same mission. We’re going beyond just single platforms equal single things,' Allvin said. 'Maybe there’s different ways to provide combat effects, understanding what that is, embracing and leaning into human machine teaming, understanding what autonomy can actually do for us, knowing that’s going to be a part of our future.' Allvin then announced new 'fighter drone' designations for the designs that General Atomics and Anduril are currently developing in the first phase, or Increment 1, of the Collaborative Aircraft (CCA) program. CCA is part of the larger NGAD initiative that also includes the planned sixth-generation stealth combat jet. The NGAD aircraft has always been envisioned as serving, in part, as a forward drone controller and otherwise operating closely together with CCAs. A composite rendering of the CCA designs that General Atomics, at top, and Anduril, at bottom, are currently developing, along with their new formal designations. General Atomics/Anduril/TWZ The panelists today were also definitive in their belief that piloted combat aircraft will continue to have a role for the foreseeable future. 'We've been doing quite a bit of simulator work with incorporating manned and unmanned teaming, and we believe that there's some value to that as we go into the future,' Gen. Wilsbach said. '[However,] in 2025 we don't have the artificial intelligence [AI] that we can pluck pilots out of aircraft and plunk AI in them to the degree that the AI can replace a human brain. Someday we will have that, I trust, but right now we don't.' 'We're in this place where we're improving the artificial intelligence aspects, the human-machine team, all those areas are growth areas, but we have to iterate to the outcome,' Lt. Gen. Dale White, currently the Military Deputy in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, added during the panel discussion today. 'And I think that's &#8230; the path that we're on.' 'As we walk down this warfighting path, we're going to have to iterate to the outcome, and it's going to take some time,' he continued. 'I know this Air Force is up to the task. I think CCA is going to put us on that path.' 'The reality is, this is where the threat is taking this because our adversaries are doing very similar things,' White also said during the panel discussion in regard to AI and advances in autonomy more generally. 'We can't sit back and just watch.' 'I don't see us fully stepping away from, you now, manned aircraft ever,' Gen. Kunkel added. A final decision on what course of action to take in regard to the NGAD combat jet, and what that aircraft might look like in the end, has yet to be made. There are also lingering budgetary questions. Concerns about the affordability of the new sixth-generation aircraft were an important factor in prompting last year's review of the program to begin with. The Air Force has a number of modernization priorities it needs to balance funding for, including the CCA program and work on new stealthy aerial refueling tankers. Aviation Week just recently reported that service might be considering axing Next-Generation Air-Refueling System (NGAS), or at least the stealth tanker component, to help preserve funds for the NGAD aircraft. There is also the matter of the ballooning costs of the Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile program and an ongoing debate about the optimal size of the future B-21 Raider stealth bomber fleet. A rendering of a notional stealth aerial refueling tanker. Lockheed Martin Skunk Works On top of this, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has ordered a complete review of spending plans for the upcoming 2026 Fiscal Year. The goal is to cut tens of billions of dollars from existing programs to help fund new priorities under President Donald Trump, including the Golden Dome missile defense initiative. Dysfunction in Congress raises additional concerns about when any major new defense spending might get approved. 'Fiscal constraints don't change what it takes to win,' Gen. Kunkel said. 'We know what it takes to win. It takes all of the Air Force. It takes air superiority. And if America wants to make those investments to win, then we'll do so. If America doesn't want to make those investments, then we'll take more risk.' 'I'm not so foolish to think that this is like a black and white decision on, you know, win versus loss. There's a degree of risk involved,' he added. 'But if we fund more force, we decrease operational risk. We decrease the risk for our policy makers.' 'And it is true that our adversaries are moving quickly. They are,' he continued. 'Fiscal choices should be driven by what it takes to win.' Another rendering of notional sixth-generation combat jets. Lockheed Martin Gen. Kunkel has been and remains particularly bullish on the Air Force ultimately coming out of the current budget uncertainty with an increase in funding rather than a decrease. He did also acknowledge at the Hudson Institute event last week that cuts to existing programs could still be painful. Many questions remain to be answered about the NGAD aircraft's future. However, it is now clear that the Air Force has concluded that the path forward that offers the best option for achieving critical air superiority in future high-end fights with the lowest amount of risk includes buying a fleet of new crewed sixth-generation stealth combat jets.

F-22 Raptor Finally Getting A Helmet Mounted Display	The F-22 Raptor is finally getting a Helmet Mounted Display (HMD) — Thales' popular Scorpion system — with the Hawaii Air National Guard's F-22s being slated to receive it. The rest of the F-22 community could follow their lead. At the same time, a larger contract to replace all of the Joint Helmet Mounted Cuing Systems (JHMCS) worn by USAF F-16C/D Block 40/42 and Block 50/52 pilots with the Scorpion was just announced. The award displaces JHMCS as the dominant HMD on USAF F-16s, with one HMD type now being standardized across the Air Force's Viper fleet. The fact that the F-22, the world's most capable air-to-air fighter, does not have an HMD has always been a point of contention. It was originally planned that Raptor pilots would get one, but this was cut during development. It has been discussed that JHMCS, in particular, had integration issues with the type. Even as the Raptor gained the AIM-9X missile capable of hitting targets far off the centerline of the jet during a dogfight, F-22 pilots still lacked the ability to target it dynamically via its primary method — an HMD. You can read all about this strange situation in this past piece of ours. Regardless, now the Air National Guard is taking the lead on fixing the issue once and for all with the help of the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU). The 199th Fighter Squadron out of Honolulu is set to integrate the Scorpion with their Raptors. The Scorpion HMD seen on display at AFA Warfare Symposium in Colorado this week. (Howard Altman) (Howard Altman) Our Howard Altman talked with Thales about Scorpions latest wins on the show floor of AFA's Warfare Symposium in Colorado today, with Thales' Lou Taddeo telling TWZ: 'We just won a contract from the Defense Innovation Unit… Ostensibly we're working really with the first real customer, the Air National Guard… to put Scorpion on ANG-operated F-22s. So that just kicked off, and we hope that eventually the big Air Force will also buy Scorpion for the rest of the U.S. Air Force F-22 fleet.' The contract to equip the Raptor with Scorpion was awarded in September, 2024, under the Raptor Open System Tactical-Helmet Display (ROST-HD) program. Interesting enough, a version of Scorpion was previously tested on the F-22, although little is known about the circumstances surrounding those trials. Competing priorities in terms of upgrades have always been a challenge for the F-22 fleet and the Scorpion never made it into operational Raptor cockpits. You can read more about this in our past exclusive reporting here. F-22 pilot wearing Scorpion at Nellis AFB back in 2020. (Jamie Hunter) JHMCS had brought about helmet-mounted display and targeting technology to the USAF's fighter fleets and has been serving for over two decades on USAF F-15s and F-16s. While providing heads-up situational awareness unlike any hard-mounted display could, it also gave USAF 4th generation fighters the ability to fully utilize the AIM-9X Sidewinder's high off-boresight (HOBS) targeting capability. In other words, the pilot has to just look at the target within a specific engagement envelope in order for the AIM-9X to lock on. Meanwhile, Scorpion has become an increasingly dominant player within the USAF's stable, equipping Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Block 30 F-16s, as well as USAF A-10s, These users are in addition to more unique use cases, like aboard the AC-130 gunship. Scorpion has also found its way into the private adversary support community, with TacAir's F-5ATs and Top Aces' F-16A/Bs being equipped with the type. AC-130 pilot wearing the Scorpion HMD.

Read all about these cutting-edge upgrades to these private aggressor jets in this recent piece of mine: Tactical Air pic.twitter.com/YuudCbJj3Q&mdash; Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) March 26, 2020 While JHMCS, which now comes in a more advanced Digital JHMCS from, uses a custom carved visor unique to each pilot to display its projected information, Scorpion uses a pane-like monocle system that fits under a visor and in between the eye and night vision goggles. The original JHMCS is not night vision goggle compatible. Scorpion is also capable of projecting in full color, not just monochrome, which can help with crew interpretation of the vast amount of information that can be displayed through the system. This includes weapons targeting, navigation, sensor, and data-link symbology. Going beyond simpler flight data and weapons information, modern HMDs like Scorpion leverage augmented reality that can project friend and foe locations all around the pilot. In a media release, Thales states: 'This contact, issued by the USAF utilizing the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA), is the first of several anticipated delivery orders to modernize the USAF fleet of F-16s with more interoperable technology. The contract arrangement also allows a procurement option for any F-16 NATO partner to modernize with Scorpion kit capability. Initial kits are anticipated to be delivered to the USAF in early ​ 2025. The Scorpion HMD kits will replace the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) and allow the USAF a standardized Scorpion HMD solution across Air Force, Air National Guard and USAF Reserve F-16s. Scorpion provides a modern digital platform allowing for enhanced pilot situational awareness with full color symbology and a single display for both day and night operations. Tracking accuracy is also markedly improved, as Scorpion is baselined with Visionix's precision HObIT (Hybrid Optically based Inertial Tracker) tracker. The HObIT system provides precise tracking through a fusion of inertial-optical technology.' An image showing how Scorpion's monocle fits behind night vision goggles. (Thales) Media Services Thales' Taddeo expanded a bit more for us on what Scorpion will bring to the table for USAF F-16s and how it compares to JHMCS in general: 'Scorpion compared to classic joint helmet [JHMCS]… Scorpion is a near eye display, full color out of the box, night vision and extreme accuracy off axis cuing… JHMCS was designed in 1996, I was on that team. So it's needed for up upgrade.' 'Scorpion came along in 2009… Air National Guard A-10s and F-16 block 30s, and then we iterated it with our inertial tracker, HObIT. It still offers near eye display, color symbology, and the tracker accuracy of HObIT is superior to JHMCS. But what the warfighter likes is its adaptability to the cockpit and simplistic approach to HMDs. They love the near eye display, and they love color. We give the warfighter the option to change the symbology any way they want. We actually deliver a software developers kit for free. So our customers can make their own symbology. We're out of the symbology game… In the case of F 16, the U.S. Air Force owns it. When we're going to replace JHMCS in the block 40s and 50s, we actually have a kit that we developed… that directly replaces JHMCS. We colorize the symbology better tracker accuracy and out of the box night vision cueing using the customer's own night vision goggles.' As to what the future holds for Scorpion, Taddeo also told TWZ: 'The cool part about scorpion is it's a modular system. When we iterate things, we don't sell you a new helmet. We're working on the next better version of our waveguide display, higher resolution, more bright, cheaper. We'll just offer a replacement kit for the display. We did it with a tracker. We had a magnetic tracker and we developed the inertial optical tracker. We actually took these kits back and we just gave them a new kit with a new tracker and their old display… So that's kind of our approach. So the future is, this thing can still grow as the technology matures.'

Rotating Detonation Engine For Future High-Performance Missiles S...	A novel type of jet propulsion, a rotating detonation engine (RDE), has been successfully tested by Pratt & Whitney. The development could be highly significant for the U.S. military, with RDE technology at the center of the project called Gambit, which aims to provide a propulsion system for a mass-producible, low-cost, high-supersonic, long-range weapon for air-to-ground strike. Artwork the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has previously released related to the Gambit project. DARPA RTX — of which Pratt & Whitney is a business unit — announced today that a series of tests on the RDE has been completed at the RTX Technology Research Center in Connecticut. Previously, RDE propulsion systems had only been run in the form of small prototypes. Next, the company says it will move on to integrated engine and vehicle ground tests, to be conducted with the U.S. Department of Defense 'in the coming years.' 'Our testing simulated aggressive assumptions for how and where the rotating detonation engine needs to perform,' Chris Hugill, senior director of Pratt & Whitney’s GATORWORKS development team, said in a media release about the latest campaign. 'This testing validated key elements of Pratt & Whitney’s design approach and provides substantiation to continue RTX vehicle and propulsion integration to accelerate future capabilities for our customers.' In terms of how they operate, RDE propulsion systems have significant differences compared to a traditional turbojet or turbofan engine and hardly require any moving parts. In turbojet or turbofan engines, air is fed in from an inlet and compressed and then is mixed with fuel and burned via deflagration (where combustion occurs at a subsonic rate) in a combustion chamber. This process creates the continuous flow of hot, high-pressure air needed to make the whole system run. In an RDE, the combustion (which happens at a supersonic rate) occurs in an enclosed, annular (ring-shaped) chamber. During flight, fast-moving air is sucked into the chamber and a mixture of fuel is injected into it. The injection ignites a flame-like detonation wave that travels around the ring for as long as fuel is injected, in a thermodynamic cycle, providing propulsive thrust. 1. Combustion in the enclosed, ring-shaped chamber. RTX 2. In flight, fast-moving air is drawn into the chamber, and fuel mixture is injected. RTX 3. Injection ignites a flame-like detonation wave that travels around the ring for as long as fuel is injected. RTX The advantages of an RDE include high thermal efficiency and more power, which means the engine can also be smaller, lighter, and more cost-effective. After all, most longer-range air-to-ground missiles today require scaled-down jet engines that are single use, making this a much less cost-effective propulsion setup. In a practical application, such as a missile, since an RDE is more compact than a traditional engine, there is more space for fuel, giving longer range. Additional capacity can also be used to house sensors, warheads, or other payloads. A video provides a more detailed walkthrough of the rotating detonation engine concept: Pratt & Whitney’s current work on the RDE is based on a contract from the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), which called upon Raytheon (now RTX) to develop this kind of propulsion for 'effectors' — primarily missiles. The initial work was conducted by the RTX Technology Research Center, which then teamed up with Pratt & Whitney to mature the technology. Ultimately, the RDE is planned to power a new generation of effectors, including missiles designed and developed by Raytheon. Experimentation with RDE concepts dates back to the 1950s, but actually creating a workable engine of this type had proved elusive until very recently, at least publicly. According to RTX, there were two main technological hurdles to overcome before the RDE could be successfully demonstrated. The first challenge involved the fuel injection component. Simply put, the balance of air and fuel in the chamber has to be perfect, consistently, to ensure an effective detonation wave. The second challenge, RTX says, was designing and manufacturing parts, which relied upon advanced techniques, including additive manufacturing and physics-based modeling. Overall, RTX’s work on the RDE is closely related to a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) project called Gambit. The main aim of this effort is 'to develop and demonstrate a novel rotating detonation engine propulsion system that enables a mass-producible, low-cost, high-supersonic, long-range weapon for air-to-ground strike in an anti-access/area denial (A2AD) environment.' Gambit was launched in 2022, and the following year, Raytheon secured a contract from DARPA to develop and demonstrate a practical RDE for the Gambit project. While RTX talks about the potential for the rotating detonation concept to be harnessed in the broad category of 'effectors,' it would appear to be of greatest significance for future missiles, like the ones envisioned under DARPA’s Gambit project. Missiles using this kind of propulsion arrangement would achieve greater efficiency and lighter (and potentially smaller) missile bodies, which in turn would allow for enhanced performance — especially in terms of range — and/or payload capacity. Future missiles that are able to achieve efficient sustained supersonic speed over long distances would be of considerable importance in terms of time-sensitive mission requirements. Above all, any future high-end conflict in the Pacific, such as one against China, would automatically involve all sorts of operational demands across a broad area, much of it covered in water. 'The government is looking for missiles that go faster and fly farther,' Beata Maynard, an associate director in Advanced Military Engines at Pratt & Whitney, said in a media release today. 'Combining Pratt & Whitney propulsion technology with a Raytheon vehicle could result in a weapons system that addresses warfighters’ immediate needs.' A rendering of a notional rotating detonation engine-powered missile that the AFRL has previously released. USAF/AFRL via Aviation Week RDE is not the only exotic propulsion system that’s being considered to power future missiles, effectors, and even aircraft. There are also ramjets and dual-mode ramjets (the latter also using RDE technology), which can confer hypersonic performance. Hypersonic speed is defined as anything above Mach 5. While there’s clearly an appetite for the kinds of advantages that a rotating detonation engine would confer on a variety of future missiles, it should be recalled that this technology is very much still in its infancy. There will be plenty more hurdles to overcome before propulsion systems of this kind find their way into actual missiles. However, once mastered, this technology promises to significantly help lower the cost and accelerate the production, on top of the various performance advantages.

Mysterious Naval Vessel Spotted In Washington State Is A New DARP...	A slender, partially covered naval ship that recently emerged in Washington state is the Defiant, a new medium-sized uncrewed surface vessel (USV) designed from the keel up to operate without any humans ever onboard. Developed under the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) No Manning Required Ship (NOMARS) program, Defiant could be an important stepping stone for the U.S. Navy's ambitions to add larger and more capable USVs to its fleets. DARPA confirmed to TWZ that construction of the Defiant, also known by the hull code USX-1, was completed earlier this month. As noted, the first indications that the vessel had been launched came from residents in Washington state who spotted it being pushed by a tug through the Saratoga Passage in Puget Sound north of Seattle. This area of the Sound is also just a few miles from the U.S. Navy's Naval Air Station (NAS) Whidbey Island. User @IntelWalrus on X was first to bring this to our attention. The USX-1 Defiant seen being moved from the shipyard to the water earlier this month. DARPA The USX-1 Defiant seen after its launch.DARPA The 180-foot-long, 240-metric ton Defiant is now set to 'undergo extensive in-water testing, both dockside and at sea' and 'is scheduled to depart for a multi-month at sea demonstration in spring 2025,' according to DARPA. It is unclear where exactly the vessel is currently docked. Serco Inc. is the primary contractor for the USV, which it has been developing since 2020. The company has told TWZ in the past that the core Defiant USV without any add-on mission systems has an approximately $25 million price tag. The U.S. military has historically categorized uncrewed vessels like Defiant with lengths under 200 feet and displacements under 500 tons, but that are larger than ones with speedboat and jetski-type designs, as medium USVs (MUSV). Large USVs (LUSV) have been defined as ones up to 300 feet long and that displace up to 2,000 tons. A picture of Defiant in the Puget Sound, as well as additional images DARPA has now released, show much of the vessel literally still under wraps. However, the overall hullform, along with the mast at the center sporting various commercial navigation radars and other antennas, is in line with models and computer-generated renders of the design shown in the past. An additional smaller mast with more radars and other antennas is also present on the bow. A view of the USX-1 Defiant with the vessel's main mast and the smaller mast at the bow visible. DARPA A previously released rendering of the Defiant design. DARPA Other details about Defiant as it exists now are limited and TWZ has also reached out to Serco for more information. NOMARS program requirements DARPA released in the past called for designs capable of long-duration open-ocean operation with distributed hybrid power generation, podded propulsors, and high-capacity batteries, as well as a high-degree of hydrodynamic efficiency. The NOMARS program has also put an emphasis on a concept called 'graceful degradation' wherein 'individual equipment to fail over time by having enough system-level redundancy to meet full system requirements at speeds of at least 15 knots after one year at sea.' As designed, Defiant has large open spaces on top of its deck in front of and behind its main mast for add-on payloads. Secro has shown models loaded with standard shipping containers, which could hold an array of different mission systems, as well as general cargo. The company has also shown how the USV might be armed using what BAE Systems is now marketing as the Adaptable Deck Launching System (ADL). The ADL is a modular angled launcher designed to fire missiles from the same canisters used with the Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) found on many U.S. and foreign warships. As such, ADLs can launch a variety of surface-to-air, anti-ship, and land-attack missiles, as well as anti-submarine rockets. A model of the Defiant with a standard 40-foot shipping container behind the main mast and an ADL at the bow end. Joseph Trevithick An ADL fires a missile during testing on land. BAE Systems Defiant, at least initially, is intended primarily as a testbed to demonstrate the ability of such a vessel to operate autonomously for extended periods without any humans ever being onboard, even just to monitor systems and provide extra margins of safety. 'The NOMARS program aims to challenge the traditional naval architecture model, designing a seaframe (the ship without mission systems) from the ground up with no provision, allowance, or expectation for humans on board,' DARPA says on its website. 'By removing the human element from all ship design considerations, the program intends to demonstrate significant advantages, to include: size, cost, at-sea reliability, greater hydrodynamic efficiency, survivability to sea-state, and survivability to adversary actions through stealth considerations and tampering resistance.' Last year, DARPA, in cooperation with the U.S. Navy, conducted a successful test of an at-sea refueling system developed to support the NOMARS mission. Two Navy USVs, the Ranger and the Mariner, which are converted offshore support vessels that retain the ability to operate in crewed mode, were used to demonstrate the refueling system. The US Navy's USVs Mariner, at rear, and Ranger, in front, sail together in 2023. USN 'Fueling at sea (FAS) for USVs presents a problem that needs to be solved as current FAS solutions use personnel to handle lines and hoses on the platform being refueled,' according to a press release DARPA put out in December. 'Requiring personnel on the USV for the operation adds significant constraints on USV design and operations, as the vessel must then be designed with considerations for safety of the humans on board, even if for a short period of time. It can also be risky and sometimes dangerous to transport personnel to a USV in rough seas or high winds.' 'For the recent test, USV Ranger carried a receiving station representative of the system that will be on the NOMARS USV Defiant, and USV Mariner carried a refueling 'mini-station,' custom-designed by NOMARS prime contractor Serco Inc,' the release added. 'While there were personnel aboard both vessels during the event, no people were involved with operations on the receiving side.' A picture DARPA released from the NOMARS fueling-at-sea test last year. DARPA However, Serco has already been actively pitching Defiant as at least a pathway to a range of operational capabilities, including new armed USVs and ones capable of acting as uncrewed logistics platforms. The company has already been working on a larger USV concept called Dauntless leveraging the work done under NOMARS, which could be armed with up to four ADLs, as well as carry other payloads. A model of the Dauntless USV concept depicted with four ADLs. Joseph Trevithick Defiant was also designed with ease of production in mind and Secro has previously told TWZ that the USVs could be produced outside of traditional shipyards, including by railworks, if needed. This could make the design, or future variants or derivatives thereof, very attractive to the U.S. Navy, which has been facing increasingly worrisome struggles to acquire traditional crewed warships. That has come amid broader concerns about U.S. shipyard capacity, or the lack thereof, for building new naval vessels and maintaining existing ones. The U.S. shipbuilding industry continues to be grossly outpaced by that of China, America's current chief global competitor, despite efforts to narrow the gap in recent years. Earlier this year, the Navy announced plans to simplify its USV acquisition strategy to focus on smaller, simpler, and more interchangeable designs rather than larger and exquisite ones. The service had previously been working toward fielding distinct fleets of MUSVs and LUSVs. The Navy's Mariner and Ranger USVs sail together with a Japanese Mogami class frigate. USN 'The designs already exist, and we must not over-spec this,' Rear Adm. William Daly, head of the Navy’s surface warfare division (N96), told an audience, including TWZ, at the Surface Navy Association’s annual symposium in January. 'We’ve also had sufficient funding and experimentation to date to know what we need.' 'Many of the payloads are ready and tested. [Concepts of operation] are coalescing,' Daly added. 'Let’s move faster. This is efficient, this is effective, and this is scalable.' DARPA's NOMARS program, especially now with Defiant about to head off for its first at-sea demonstrations, looks set to be another important part of the U.S. military's uncrewed naval future.

‘Fighter Drone’ Designations Officially Assigned To Collaborative...	The U.S. Air Force has designated the drones that General Atomics and Anduril are currently developing as part of the first phase, or Increment 1, of the Collaborative Combat Aircraft program as the YFQ-42A and YFQ-44A, respectively. These appear to be the U.S. military's first ever 'fighter drone' designations. The Increment 1 CCAs are expected to work closely together with crewed combat jets primarily in the air-to-air combat role, at least initially. Chief of Staff of the Air Force Gen. David Allvin announced the YFQ-42A and YFQ-44A during a keynote address at the Air & Space Forces Association’s 2025 Warfare Symposium this evening, at which TWZ is in attendance. In the U.S. military-wide designation system for aircraft and missiles 'F' stands for 'fighter' and 'Q' stands for drone. The 'Y' at the front indicates a prototype design. A picture shown during Gen. Allvin's keynote of a model of General Atomics' CCA design with the YFQ-42A designation. USAF A picture of a model of Anduril CCA design along with the YFQ-44A designation that also accompanied Allvin's keynote. USAF Allvin did not make any mention of official nicknames to go along with the YFQ-42A and YFQ-44A designations. Anduril's internal name for its design is Fury. General Atomics does not appear to have given its CCA design a name, at least publicly. Interestingly, Blue Force Technologies, the company that originally started the development of Fury, displayed a test article with a notional YFQ-XX marking years ago. Anduril acquired Blue Force Technologies in 2023, and you read more about the story of how Fury came to be in this past in-depth TWZ feature. A view of Blue Force Technologies’ booth at a past iteration of the Air &#038; Space Forces Association’s main annual conference in Washington, D.C., showing a Fury nose section with the notional YFQ-XX nomenclature written on the side. A rendering behind also shows the drone armed with an AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile. Andrew Van Timmeren/LinkedIn 'Today, the Air Force announced the mission design series designation for Anduril’s CCA prototype: YFQ-44A,' Dr. Jason Levin, Senior Vice President of Engineering at Anduril Industries, said in a statement. 'Together, in close partnership with the Air Force, we are pioneering a new generation of semi-autonomous fighter aircraft that is fundamentally transforming air dominance by delivering highly capable, mass-producible, more affordable, and more autonomous aircraft by the end of the decade.' The designation 'represents the first aircraft type of a YFQ designation, signaling a new era of uncrewed fighter aircraft,' Levin added. 'It reinforces what we already knew: our CCA is a high performance aircraft designed specifically for the air superiority mission, acting as a force multiplier for crewed aircraft within the real constraints of cost and time.' TWZ has also reached out to General Atomics for comment. As it stands now, the Air Force is looking to buy at least between 100 and 150 Increment 1 CCAs. In 2024, the service selected General Atomics and Anduril to proceed in what has ostensibly been a competition for the first batch of CCAs – Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman had also submitted designs – but it remains unclear whether it will ultimately acquire YFQ-42As, YFQ-44As, or a mix of both. As already noted, the primary mission of the first tranche of CCAs will be acting as flying 'missile trucks' supporting crewed combat jets, in line with the new FQ designations, at least to start. Electronic warfare and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions, as well as the ability to use the drones more indecently on their own missions, have also been discussed. Additional views of models of General Atomics CCA design, at top, and Anduril's Fury, below. General Atomics/Jamie Hunter The Air Force is also in the process of refining requirements for additional drones as part of Increment 2 of the CCA program. The CCAs in the second tranche are expected to be more expensive than those in the first, though the exact capability mix they might have and what missions they might be tailored for are still unknown. The service has said in the past that it could acquire as many as 1,000 CCAs, or more, in total. The Air Force is very much still exploring how it will incorporate CCAs into its concepts of operations and overall force structure, but Gen. Allvin and other service officials consistently say they expect the drones have a transformative impact. 'We're looking at different ways to execute the same mission. We're going beyond just single platforms equal single things,' Allvin said in his keynote tonight. 'Maybe there's different ways to provide combat effects, understanding what that is, embracing and leaning into human machine teaming, understanding what autonomy can actually do for us, knowing that's going to be a part of our future.' 'And now we have two prototypes of Collaborative Combat Aircraft that were on paper less than a couple of years ago,' the Air Force's top officer continued. 'They're going to be ready to fly this summer. &#8230; we are leaning into a new chapter of aerial warfare.' Whatever the Air Force's initial CCA force looks like in the end, what have now been dubbed the YFQ-42A and YFQ-44A look set to have historic impact on how the service fights in the future.

F-22 Raptors Completed Six Test Flights For New Sensor Upgrades	Lockheed Martin says it conducted six successful flight tests last year as part of work to add new capabilities on the F-22 Raptor stealth fighter. The U.S. Air Force's small, but highly capable and heavily in-demand F-22 fleet is set to receive a number of upgrades to help keep the jets at the very tip of the service's spear, potentially into the 2040s. This includes a new Infrared Defensive System (IRDS), as well as other additional sensors and stealthy range-extending drop tanks. Representatives from Lockheed Martin provided an update on the F-22 program, as well as other company efforts, to TWZ and other outlets at the Air & Space Forces Association's 2025 Warfare Symposium, which kicked off today. At present, the Air Force has just over 180 Raptors in service, 32 of which are in an older configuration and relegated to test and training duties as a result. An F-22 test jet. USAF 'We are all very keen to understand and recognize the need for air combat platforms that go farther to sense and see farther and to shoot farther,' Mike Shoemaker, Lockheed Martin's Vice President & General Manager of its Integrated Fighter Group, said. 'And so, we've been partnering with the Air Force. And last year, we completed six successful flight test demos for advanced sensors [to] extend the Raptor’s ability to detect, track, ID, and eventually target, at range – I'll say tactically significant ranges – so it gives them the advantage in any fight.' Shoemaker did not provide more specific details about the 'advanced sensors' being added to the F-22. Raptors, as well as sensor testbed aircraft, have been observed flying with stealthy underwing pods for years now. Those pods are widely understood to be part of plans to integrate an infrared search and track (IRST) capability onto the jets. This would align with Shoemaker's comments here and is something we will come back in a moment. A F-22 seen with the stealthy underwing pods in 2022. James Reeder N33TR arrives with the F-22 pod after a test flight over the Eglin ranges. pic.twitter.com/K11EHm3n0x&mdash; 𝙎𝙍_𝙋𝙡𝙖𝙣𝙚𝙨𝙥𝙤𝙩𝙩𝙚𝙧 (@SR_Planespotter) January 17, 2025 'Also recently on contract to integrate the next-generation infrared defensive measure systems on the F-22, which give it upgraded missile warning capability and long-range detection,' Shoemaker added. 'So both of these are increasing Raptor's lethality and survivability.' What Shoemaker is talking about here is the IRDS contract, which Lockheed Martin announced in January. The company has already said that IRDS will feature a distributed sensor array leveraging the TacIRST system, which was unveiled back in 2022. TacIRST sensors, at least as they have been shown to date, feature a compact staring-type design with a fixed field of view. F-5 Advanced Tiger aggressor jets belonging to private contractor Tactical Air Support (TacAir) are the only aircraft known to have an integrated TacIRST system currently. A TacAir F-5AT aggressor jet equipped with a TacIRST sensor (circled in red). Tactical Air Support Shoemaker's comments today indicate that the 'advanced sensor' capability that the F-22 is set to receive is distinct from the IRDS. Having additional, dedicated IRST capability in podded form on top of IRDS would make a certain amount of sense, and TWZ previously posited this could be the case. Traditional IRSTs, both ones integrated into aircraft and carried in pods, have historically had larger aperture sensors in gimbal mounts with flexible fields of view, unlike what TacIRST offers. In 2017, Ken Merchant, then Lockheed Martin Vice President for the F-22 program, also told what is now Air & Space Forces Magazine that 'we really don’t have the real estate' to install an IRST system, at least one akin to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter's Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS), inside the Raptor. EOTS, which is primarily a sensor for air-to-ground targeting, has an infrared search and track function, as well. Just by itself, IRDS sounds like it will offer a major improvement over the F-22's existing AN/AAR-56 Missile Launch Detector (MLD) system, which currently offers spherical infrared threat warning. The distributed array of TacIRST sensors might also be able to help provide additional overall situational awareness and other capabilities broadly similar to what the F-35's Distributed Aperture System (DAS) and other DAS-like setups offer. Integrated and podded IRST capabilities together would also be a valuable combination. As TWZ has previously explained: 'IRSTs, in general, are typically only able to instantaneously determine a target’s angle and bearing, and track it, with it taking more effort to determine its range using just a single sensor platform. Two IRST sensors on separate aircraft that are networked together can instantly triangulate the target’s range, which can then provide more robust engagement-quality target tracks. Lockheed Martin has demonstrated this kind of networked IRST capability in combination with its Legion Pod in the past and it is a common practice for aircraft equipped with advanced IRST capabilities. The IRST21 sensor used on the Legion Pod, as well as in other podded configurations, is a more traditional gimbaled type, as you can read more about here.' An abstract graphical depiction of two podded IRST sensors working networked together. Lockheed Martin No matter how the IRST capabilities are integrated into the F-22 in the end, it is something the Raptor was supposed to have originally, but was cut ostensibly for budgetary reasons late in the jet's development. There has been a global resurgence of interest in IRST systems in recent years, especially within the U.S. military, due in large part to the benefits they offer over traditional radars for spotting and tracking stealthy targets. IRSTs can also help cue radars to targets of interest, and fused data from these, as well as passive radiofrequency sensors, can produce higher-quality target tracks, enhance situational awareness, and help with positive target identification. In addition, IRSTs are passive sensors that can be used without pumping out signals that could alert an opponent to the fact that it has been detected and is being tracked. Signals from active sensors like radars can also make friendly aircraft easier for enemy forces to spot. IRSTs are also immune to ever-growing electronic warfare threats. 'All of our engineering work and design work that's done will ensure that we preserve the stealth capabilities of the [F-22] platform,' Lockheed Martin's Shoemaker noted today. Stealth aircraft, crewed and uncrewed, as well as stealthy munitions, are increasingly part of the threat ecosystem U.S. forces expect to face, especially in any future high-end fight. China, in particular, is making major strides in this arena, and just showed off two previously unseen stealth combat jet designs in December. pic.twitter.com/IZ9BlwjoOc&mdash; Justin Bronk (@Justin_Br0nk) December 26, 2024 pic.twitter.com/BKHGVbRIbn&mdash; OedoSoldier (@OedoSoldier) December 26, 2024 'As I said, one of the things we think you've got to be able to do is to sense and see farther,' Lockheed Martin's Shoemaker also said today. 'And if it can now see and sense farther, it can also share that information.' The F-22's ability to function as a highly capable 'quarterback' for larger aerial force packages is something TWZ has highlighted multiple times in the past. Lockheed Martin, together with the Air Force and other industry partners, has also been working to expand the Raptor's communications capabilities in recent years. USAF Lockheed Martin says the Raptor was the first combat aircraft to make full use of a software-defined open mission systems architecture to make it faster and easier, in general, to integrate new and improved functionality. A new software baseline configuration for the F-22 called Release 4 is in the final stages of testing now, and the hope is that it will be cleared for loading onto the fleet by the end of this Spring, according to Shoemaker. This will also make it even easier to integrate third-party 'apps' into the Raptor mission systems. 'I think, right now, we're looking at the next couple of years for when that will actually be delivered to the fleet,' Shoemaker added about the timeline for the Raptor's new sensor capabilities in response to a direct question from TWZ's Howard Altman. In the meantime, the F-22 fleet continues to be very much in demand. 'Our Lockheed Martin team has supported significant increases in both operations and deployments,' Shoemaker said today. 'With this relatively small fleet size and over … half a million flying hours, those come with unique challenges.' 'But even with that pace, this aircraft won't require any major structural improvements or upgrades to last well into the 2040s,' he continued. A slide highlighting recent F-22 program highlights and achievements that accompanied remarks from Mike Shoemaker, Lockheed Martin's Vice President &#038; General Manager of its Integrated Fighter Group, today. Lockheed Martin How long the F-22s will continue to serve is an open question tied directly to the uncertain fate of the Air Force's plans for a new crewed sixth-generation combat jet as part of the larger Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative. Last year, the service conducted a deep review of the NGAD combat jet, originally envisioned as a Raptor replacement, and there are clear indications that the resulting analysis favors continuing as originally planned. However, there are serious concerns about the affordability of the NGAD combat jet, especially when taking into account other top-tier modernization priorities, including stealthy aerial refueling tankers and Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones. The ballooning cost of the Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile program was a key factor in launching the NGAD review in the first place. The optimal size of the B-21 Raider stealth bomber fleet is also currently under debate. USAF The entire Department of Defense is now also facing down the prospect of major cuts to existing programs to help redirect resources to new priorities under President Donald Trump's administration, including the Golden Dome missile defense initiative. For its part, Lockheed Martin still sees upgraded F-22s as a bridge to whatever next-generation air combat platform comes next. Raptor modernization work has already been feeding into NGAD. The F-22 fleet does look to have many years, if not decades of service still ahead of it, buoyed by a long-promised and ever-more important IRST capability and other upgrades.

Notorious Abandoned Pacific Island Outpost Eyed For Space Force R...	The U.S. Space Force is looking at reactivating an abandoned rocket launching site on an abandoned Pacific island stronghold to test technologies for future rocket cargo delivery missions. The site, on Johnston Atoll in the North Pacific Ocean, around 860 miles southwest of Hawaii, has a notorious history involving nuclear, chemical and biological weapons but is now earmarked for the potential construction of two landing pads. This is part of the Rocket Cargo Vanguard program, which seeks to use rockets to move military supplies from one point on Earth to another much more rapidly than is currently possible. The confirmation of the plans for Johnston Atoll was provided in a notice of intent (NOI) published today by the Department of the Air Force (DAF), which includes the Air Force and Space Force. The NOI serves to 'advise the public of the pending preparation of an Environmental Assessment (EA)' for the two landing pads. The assessment will evaluate the impacts of the construction and operation of the two landing pads on the atoll, which will provide for up to 10 reentry vehicle landings per year over four consecutive years. Potentially, the testing could begin as early as this year. U.S. Air Force concept artwork shows how a cargo rocket might be used to enable rapid delivery of aircraft-size payloads for agile global logistics — in this example, for urgent humanitarian assistance and disaster response. U.S. Air Force illustration/Randy Palmer Specifically, according to the NOI, the purpose of the planned campaign is 'to safely test and demonstrate the expeditious delivery of tons of materiel through space in support of ongoing research, development, test, and experimentation' under the Rocket Cargo Vanguard program — which is also known as Point-to-Point Delivery (P2PD). Led by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rocket Cargo Vanguard is a science and technology effort to determine the viability and utility of using large commercial rockets for Department of Defense global logistics. Sometimes under different names and terminology, the project dates back to at least 2020, at least in the public realm. 'Current military modes of transportation require days to weeks of planning and logistics to provide materiel to distant locations at the time and place of need,' the NOI continues. 'The Proposed Action would explore the military utility of this technology to address rapid global mobility challenges by leveraging commercial technology to mature critical capabilities.' The same document states that Johnston Atoll was selected for possible use in the Rocket Cargo Vanguard program since the location must be 'remote, securable, U.S. Government-controlled, capable of air or maritime transport of personnel and materiel and support the disposition and removal of reentry vehicles via barged transport.' Other locations that were considered and then rejected included Kwajalein Atoll, Midway Island, and Wake Island. All of these are U.S. Pacific territories, with Kwajalein already being established as a highly important test facility. 'Upon further examination, the DAF concluded that Johnston Atoll is the only location that meets all operational requirements over the duration of the four-year reentry and landing test program.' A U.S. Air Force aerial view of Johnston Atoll, dating from 1990. U.S. Air Force Photo SSgt. Val Gempis SSGT Val Gempis Johnston Atoll, which is an unincorporated U.S. territory surrounded by ocean, 'was identified as the safest and most viable location.' This is likely also a reference to the potential impact of climate change and severe weather events. Notably, Kwajalein is still recovering from the effects of 'weather-driven waves' that caused 'significant damage' across the island early in 2024. The environmental assessment will now consider the impact of the proposed testing on Johnston Atoll, which is now designated as a National Wildlife Refuge — a classification brings its own set of criteria in terms of the impact on local biodiversity — and part of the Pacific Islands Heritage Marine National Monument. Composite satellite image of Johnston Atoll, from 2009. NASA At the same time, Johnston Atoll has a long and highly controversial history of U.S. military activities, including being used as a naval refueling depot, an air base, a test site for nuclear and biological weapons, as well as for rockets and missiles, and a site for the storage and disposal of chemical weapons. In one highly notable event, the island hosted the Starfish Prime high-altitude nuclear test in July 1962, which was the largest nuclear test conducted in outer space. Many other nuclear tests occurred at and high above the atoll from 1958 to 1975. The base has been effectively abandoned by the U.S. military since 2003, when the Army finally completed its work on decommissioning and dismantling chemical weapons on the island, as well as the related environmental cleanup. A large 9,000-foot closed runway and other abandoned infrastructure are still present on the contaminated island that has no human occupants. The desolate outpost, located deep in the Pacific, has drawn some attention in recent years as there has been suggestions that it would be reactivated as part of sweeping upgrade projects across airfields in the Pacific as contingency preparation for a war with China. An official video marking the final elimination of the chemical weapons stockpile at Johnston Atoll in November 2000. The Johnston Atoll Chemical Agent Disposal System (JACADS) destroyed a total of 412,798 chemical weapons: It was initially revealed in 2020 that the U.S. military was working with SpaceX, alongside other industry partners, on plans for cargo delivery by rocket. At that time, U.S. Army Gen. Stephen R. Lyons, previously commander of U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM), said that the Pentagon was aiming to develop technology that would allow the cargo-weight equivalent of a C-17 Globemaster III (roughly 85.5 tons) to be delivered anywhere in the world within an hour. A slide from U.S. Army Gen. Stephen R. Lyons’ virtual presentation in 2020. TRANSCOM By 2021, the Air Force’s budget proposal for Fiscal Year 2022 requested additional funding for what was then being termed as the Rocket Cargo program. At this point, the Pentagon’s stated plans included transporting payloads of up to 100 tons, including cargo and potentially personnel, via orbital or suborbital profiles to forward locations. The program was assigned Vanguard status also in 2021, the implications of which we discussed at the time. By early 2022, the AFRL had awarded SpaceX a five-year, $102 million contract to collect flight data from its Starship program in order to demonstrate technologies for point-to-point cargo and humanitarian aid transportation. The complete Starship reusable launch vehicle system, as TWZ has highlighted in the past, comprises a super-heavy rocket booster and spacecraft. So far, however, Starship test efforts have yielded mixed results. In April of 2023, the inaugural Starship flight test resulted in the super-heavy rocket exploding just minutes after launching, In the latest flight test, the seventh, which took place in January of this year, Starship ended with the vehicle exploding after a propellant leak prompted the autonomous flight safety system to self-destruct it. SpaceX Starship integrated flight test 2 at the Starbase facility along the south Texas coast on November 18, 2023. SpaceX via X/Twitter The Air Force has said it expects a full demonstration of the rocket cargo concept by 2026. This depends on successful flight testing of Starship before that point, not to mention overcoming other significant technical obstacles. Ultimately, however, the Pentagon is set on at least investigating the potential of rockets for rapidly delivering cargo across significant distances. In particular, such a capability would appear to have particular relevance in the context of future contingencies in the Indo-Pacific theater. With a growing expectation that this region will see a future high-end conflict involving U.S. forces, perhaps even before 2026, being able to call upon rockets to quickly bring critical supplies to the area would be of huge value — provided, once again, that the technology can be mastered. The NOI doesn’t specify what rockets will be used in the planned Rocket Cargo Vanguard tests, although there are strong indications that the Space Force is eyeing SpaceX’s Starship for future rocket cargo delivery missions. 'We are thinking about how we might use it,' Lt. Gen. Philip Garrant, the commander of Space Systems Command, said last November in reference to Starship. 'We think the first, most logical, given the payload volume … would be some type of rocket cargo delivery mechanism,' he added. '[We are] absolutely interested in the potential military utility and definitely following their progress.' U.S. Space Force Lt. Gen. Philip Garrant, Space Systems Command commander, and U.S. Space Force Col. Mark Shoemaker, Space Launch Delta 30 commander, at Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, March 20, 2024. U.S. Space Force photo by Senior Airman Kadielle Shaw In early 2024, it emerged that the Pentagon had approached SpaceX with a view to purchasing Starship launch vehicle systems, specifically for sensitive, high-risk missions. Since Rocket Cargo Vanguard seeks to rapidly deliver cargo, and possibly personnel, anywhere on Earth that can support a landing, the Starship is an obvious candidate for the mission. It’s the largest and most powerful rocket ever flown, according to the company, and is reportedly capable of carrying up to 150 metric tons while being fully reusable. At the same time, it’s capable of landing vertically, making it suitable for a much wider range of landing sites. It remains to be seen whether Johnston Atoll will be resurrected as a test site for the Rocket Cargo Vanguard program, although the results of the environmental assessment are due next month. Potentially, approving the island for the program could pave the way for it becoming a site for other space vehicle landings beyond Rocket Cargo. Currently, there are few, if any,nuc locations in the continental United States that can support this. If it does become part of an expanding reusable space infrastructure, that will put additional emphasis on Johnston Atoll in general, too. Whatever happens, today’s announcement reinforces the fact that the U.S. military remains committed to at least exploring the possibility of fast-track cargo supply via space launch rockets in the future.

Top Aces F-16 Aggressors Getting Ability To Insert Synthetic Band...	As the Air & Space Forces Association’s annual Air Warfare Symposium kicks off today in Aurora, Colorado, private adversary air company Top Aces is previewing its new 'constructive wingman' capability which will begin test and evaluation on its F-16A/B aggressor aircraft starting this Spring. The constructive wingman is essentially a synthetic aircraft that Top Aces’ F-16 aggressor pilots can control from their cockpits. It is inserted digitally into the sensor 'pictures' of both the aggressors and the aircraft training against it. While there is no aircraft physically added to the aerial engagement, to aircrews involved, it appears as real on their cockpit displays. The artificial intelligence and algorithms that comprise the constructive wingman are based on software developed by EpiSci (now merged into Applied Intuition), a company which TWZ has covered in relation to its work with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Alpha Dogfight program and subsequent live-flight augmented reality dogfights with AI agents. Adding one or more synthetic wingmen to a red air sortie complicates the tactical picture for the blue forces which train against Top Aces aggressors and can do so at very little cost. Among its activities, the company provides aggressor training through the Air Force’s Combat Air Force Contracted Air Support (CAFCAS) program to F-35 pilots going through Formal Training Units (FTUs) at both Eglin Air Force Base in Florida and at Luke AFB in Arizona. F-16s from Top Aces refueling alongside Luke-based F-35s. (USAF) Students at both locations go through an eight month B-course (basic course) as they transition to the F-35, learning to employ its deep capabilities in a variety of missions including offensive/defensive air to air. In beyond visual range (BVR) scenarios the extra synthetic aircraft which Top Aces is planning to introduce represent more targets for the new F-35 students to grapple with and larger and more varied formations than they would typically see with only live aircraft or in fully simulated training environments. It also fits in with the USAF's push to more deeply integrate seamless live, virtual, and constructive training, which you can read all about in our previous explainer here. Live And Constructive Aircraft Pump Up Real World Stress The War Zone spoke with Top Aces’ vice president of business development, Brian 'Taz' Delemater, and the company’s director of enterprise technology, Aaron 'Fang' Steffens, about the added training value that the constructive wingman capability could offer. As Fang Steffens acknowledges, seeing expanded formations of mixed real and synthetic adversary aircraft, which all appear as legitimate target tracks, while actually in the air ratchets up psychological pressure on blue force students that simulated environments cannot. 'That’s the thing about live training. There are so many things you can and want to do in a virtual environment right now, especially high-end tactics. But we don’t think there’s a replacement for live training with real airplanes out there. It changes the dynamic on how the student, or even an experienced instructor, is thinking when moving at speed. There are other live aircraft out there that are trying to shoot you and there’s an element of risk.' Mixing constructive and live aircraft in an airborne training environment could provide highly valuable lessons for F-35 pilots who often train in flight simulators to replicate fifth-generation adversary threats and threat environments which cannot easily be recreated in the real world. The War Zone has extensively covered Top Aces in recent years, detailing its operations and its acquisition of ex-Israeli Air Force F-16A/B Netz fighters, as well as the capabilities it has added to them. These include active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars, infra-red search and track (IRST) systems, and a proprietary open mission system which it calls the Advanced Aggressor Mission System (AAMS). But it’s important to point out that these capabilities reside in just a handful of Top Aces’ F-16s, which the company refers to as its F-16 AAF (Advanced Aggressor Fighter). Top Aces began receiving the ex-Israeli aircraft in 2021, eventually acquiring 29 of the fighters. By mid-2025, 14 of these will be airworthy and mission-ready. As of now, four jets are configured to the AAF standard including Link-16 datalinks and a Thales Visionix Gen III Scorpion helmet-mounted display system (HMDS), in addition to the capabilities mentioned above. Obviously, AAF jet use is at a premium which is why they are heavily tasked with aggressor training for fifth-generation blue forces. Top Aces has stationed four of its F-16s at Eglin and another four at Luke. Two of the jets at each location are AAFs. Adding constructive wingman capability to these would effectively increase the number of enemies Top Aces can present to F-35 students in a given sortie. How It Works Top Aces has developed constructive wingman software through its own Patuxent River, Maryland-based integration lab. Much of its work has centered on building out the pilot-vehicle interface for the new capability. The constructive wingman will be managed by Top Aces’ aggressor pilots through a multi-functional display (MFD) on the lower center pedestal panel in the cockpit rather than via a knee-mounted tablet display as has become common with other additive AI-based systems. Pilots will use standard HOTAS (hands on throttle and stick) controls to command the constructive wingman. Top Aces Viper cockpit. James Deboer The software is integrated through the company’s AAMS and the constructive wingman is presented via Link-16 data-link to the blue forces and other Top Aces aggressor aircraft. The F-16 AAF pilot sees his constructive wingman on his MFD 'just like you would see a radar track or anything else' Steffens explains. Before engaging during a red air sortie, the Top Aces pilot sets up the constructive wingman for desired formation offset and spacing. The virtual aircraft can be put into any kind of formation to give a beyond visual range look that matches the sortie training objectives. 'This is the same way that we would look to direct a manned or unmanned live wingman,' Steffens says. His mention of unmanned aircraft is purposeful. An image showing the Advanced Aggressor Fighter F-16’s multi-function display capability screen. It provides high-situational awareness displaying information from the radar and other onboard sensors as well as from other platforms via data-link. Tracks are also projected in the pilot’s Scorpion helmet-mounted display system. It also shows weapons engagement envelopes for threat profile simulation., James DeBoer Taz Delemater explains that Top Aces sees its constructive wingman capability as a possible prelude to training with mixed manned-unmanned formations using the same control methodology. The concept of unmanned aggressor aircraft, called ADAIR-UX, was viewed with enthusiasm a couple of years ago as TWZ highlighted but has since been overtaken by the increased focus on collaborative combat aircraft (CCAs). But unmanned aggressors may yet find favor. Until such time, Top Aces reckons that its constructive wingman could add immediate value and experience which may later translate to some form of ADAIR-UX. After configuring his constructive wingman, the Top Aces pilot will give general commands to it on how to engage blue forces. 'You’re telling him to be West, now turn ‘hot’, to drag-out,' Steffens says, 'those kinds of higher level directions just like you would give to a live F-16 wingman, you just cue them through the hands-on throttle and stick [controls].' The AI engine then 'flies' the constructive wingman, maneuvering the synthetic sensor target with faithful kinematics. The AAF pilot can see the maneuvering as part of the friend-foe target tracks on the F-16’s MFD. Blue force F-35s see the same combination of maneuvering real and synthetic aggressor aircraft on their displays. The constructive wingman is transmitted from the Top Aces F-16 via Link-16 and appears as a real adversary aircraft in the F-35's missions systems and cockpit display. For a given sortie, Top Aces can change the kinematics of the constructive wingman as well. 'We could have it fly like an F-16, we could have it fly like a different type of adversary aircraft as well,' Delemater adds. Top Aces F-16s flying in formation. James DeBoer As a blue force-red force engagement proceeds and possibly closes to shorter-range, the constructive wingman may no longer populate the blue force/red force operating picture rendered via Link-16. That’s because physically merging with Top Aces’ constructive wingman is not possible. To ensure that any remaining synthetic targets disappear or are disregarded as red and blue forces physically merge, Steffens explains that, 'We would develop a plan with the blue lead or instructor of record and the range training officer [RTO] beforehand. If there is an RTO, which is usually the case, particularly for larger fights, they can handle it all in real time. If there’s no RTO, there are still ways to manage [the constructive aircraft] depending on the training scenario. Then any discrepancies would get ironed out in the debrief.' That would leave live aircraft to tackle the close-in fight if the training sortie calls for such a scenario, Steffens says. 'Then, they have the highly maneuverable live F-16s that they’re actually merging with.' Steffens adds that most of the B-course training flights that Top Aces does are scripted to provide targeted training to the F-35 student. Working out a plan in advance is common and not difficult. Given the one constructive wingman-per-AAF Viper capability, the current maximum four-ship formations that Top Aces can fly at Eglin and Luke could become six-ship formations - a flight of two standard F-16s and two AAF-configured F-16s that are also controlling two synthetic wingmen. However, Delemater told TWZ that a future iteration of the constructive wingman software may allow one F-16 to project/control two synthetic aircraft. As experience with the constructive agents is gained, the company will be able to assess what sort of workload directing two synthetic targets would impart to pilots. Such experience may eventually extrapolate to cockpit control of unmanned aggressor aircraft as well. 'We’re going to continue to develop the capability,' Delemater affirms. 'A lot of it depends on how OT&E goes and the feedback from the customer.' The Value Proposition Top Aces executives point out that the constructive wingman effort is entirely driven and funded by the company and its partners, including EpiSci, which Top Aces has an ownership stake in. As things stand, there is no U.S. Air Force or Navy requirement for contract aggressor-generated constructive target capability. But if the company can demonstrate enough bang for the training buck, the services might become interested. Real aggressor aircraft and pilots are extremely expensive, if essential, training tools. Added constructive capability could stretch the return on investment from training beyond presenting taller challenges to blue forces. Simple math illustrates the cost efficiency potentially gained with constructive wingman capability. Top Aces declined to share information on the cost of operating its F-16 AAFs with TWZ but some rough estimation is possible. Fang Steffens confirmed that the average red air sortie for Top Aces F-16s has a 1.3 to 1.6 hour duration based on factors such as transit distance to ranges and time in afterburner. According to recent estimates, the USAF cost per flight hour (CPFH) of operating an F-16C is approximately $27,000. Using this number and given a 90-minute aggressor training flight, the cost of flying an aggressor F-16 may be on the order of $40,500 per average sortie. Top Aces F-16 flies off the wing of a tanker. (USAF) It’s worth noting that contracted red air support is traditionally less expensive all-in than the cost of organic red air support with a similar aircraft from within the service, but many factors impact cost. Regardless, it’s not massively different as fuel and maintenance and other primary factors are what they are for a given type. So, adding another F-16 or two could cost an additional $40,000-$80,000 per sortie. Top Aces’ potential fee for adding constructive wingman capability is unknown but the cost is theoretically a tiny fraction of flying one or two additional real aircraft, and this would largely be up-front investment for Top Aces, not a high per-sortie expense. 'For the price of one F-16, they’re going to get two,' Delemater asserts. Steffens adds that 'at range, they can get multiple targets for the price of one.' Zoom out and look at the total expense of adding real vs. synthetic targets across the F-35 B-course syllabus and the cost differential should grow markedly in favor of the constructive wingman. Top Aces distinguishes their EpiSci AI-driven constructive wingman from other synthetic entities because it can be manipulated from the cockpit rather than by an operator typically on the ground. Eliminating the need for ground control of the constructive wingman and shifting it to the cockpit potentially represents further savings. Top Aces has yet to formally brand or name the capability because of copyright concerns. The company was on the precipice of previewing its constructive wingman at last September’s AFA Air, Space & Cyber Conference in Washington DC, planning to use the moniker 'Red 5.' But a release on the capability was pulled, partly out of concern about copyright infringement. According to Top Aces’ vice president of business development, that was not the only reason. Taz Delemater said the constructive wingman was and is awaiting clearance from DoD to use specific Link-16 transceivers to facilitate its function. He added that the (USAF) customer 'hasn’t been in a rush' to add the capability. 'We also thought that maybe it would make more sense to wait until we were closer to being able to truly demo this.' Demonstration will unfold within what Top Aces refers to as a series of operational test and evaluation flights slated for some time this Spring. The Air Force will likely sit-in on these flights, which will be done from Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. If the capability is appealing enough, the service could build it in as a requirement for the CAFCAS program. That could lead to introducing it elsewhere. Asked whether Top Aces views its constructive wingman as a value-add for advanced training exercises like Red Flag or the recent Bamboo Eagle, Steffens replied in the affirmative. 'We’re a deployable exercise force. We do that quite a bit with our customers in multiple exercises and we could bring this constructive wingman capability with us.' Top Aces F-16s at their headquarters in Mesa, Arizona. James Deboer Top Aces might also bring the capability to overseas customers. At least one of the company’s A-4N Skyhawks based at Wittmundhafen in northern Germany has been upgraded to full AAF status with the AESA, IRST and AAMS capabilities that its quartet of AAF F-16s have. Adding constructive wingman capability to more of these aircraft would make sense, Steffens says. 'If you think about it, there are going to be 600 F-35s over there. The ability to train against more targets at range and still have live assets out there for all the reasons we’ve discussed would have value overseas as well.' If the constructive wingman is adopted for aggressor training in the U.S. and abroad, its presence won’t be obvious. While the IRST pods, special antennas, and pilots wearing the Scorpion helmet-mounted displays that signal AAF aircraft might be discernible, the software that enables the constructive wingman is as physically invisible. The outcome of its potential success may one day be seen by the naked eye if the constructive wingman experience leads Top Aces on a path to realizing an ADAIR-UX-like capability. 'Our company still believes that there’s a significant benefit to moving forward with unmanned aircraft in an adversary training environment,' Steffens concludes.

QF-16 Zombie Vipers To Keep Flying And Dying Into The 2030s	The U.S. Air Force expects to continue utilizing QF-16 Full Scale Aerial Target (FSAT) drones converted from F-16 Vipers fighters through at least 2035 despite moving in recent years to wind the program down. The 'Zombie Vipers' provide valuable full-size fighter targets for testing and training purposes, including to fire live missiles at and even destroy. The service has been looking to acquire new stealthy uncrewed aircraft to meet its future FSAT needs, but has not yet made any substantial progress in this regard. The Air Force 'currently plans to utilize the QF-16 into the 2030s,' a service spokesperson told TWZ. 'The sustainment effort maintains the fleet’s airworthiness and compliance with range safety requirements.' The sustainment effort in question is one that first emerged in a contracting notice the Air Force posted online earlier this month. 'The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) USAF F-16 Contracting Branch (WAMKA) is pursuing the award of an indefinite delivery / indefinite quantity type contract to provide post-production Contractor Logistic Support (CLS) for the fielded QF-16 system and repair or replacement of Drone Peculiar Equipment (DPE) and Peculiar Support Equipment (PSE),' the notice explains. 'This includes support for program management, logistics and engineering. QF-16s are regenerated F-16s that have been equipped with DPE for use in manned and unmanned operations to meet US Title 10 requirements for the warfighter in evaluating weapons systems.' 'The program office needs to sustain the fleet of approximately 90 QF-16s for an additional 10 years,' the notice continues. 'The technical data package and other Data Rights to maintain the software/hardware may not be available without partnering with the OEM. A limited technical data package is available upon request for additional technical details on this potential requirement.' A QF-16 target drone. USAF The 'OEM,' or original equipment manufacturer, for the F-16 is currently Lockheed Martin. However, most recently, Boeing had been contracted to convert Vipers into QF-16s. In 2022, Boeing shuttered one of two QF-16 conversion lines at Cecil Airport in Jacksonville, Florida. At that time, the company said it only planned to operate the second line in Tucson, Arizona, run in cooperation with the Air Force's 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (309th AMARG), until the completion of an existing contract for an unspecified number of Zombie Vipers was fulfilled. As of the 2021 Fiscal Year, the Air Force was in line to acquire a total of 134 QF-16s, according to Air Force Magazine. The 309th AMARG is also the unit in charge of managing the famous U.S. military aircraft boneyard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson. Individuals from the Defense Contract Management Agency’s Aircraft Integrated Maintenance Operations-St. Augustine stand in front of the last QF-16 to be converted at Boeing’s facility at Cecil Airport in Jacksonville, Florida, in 2022. Boeing The Air Force's QF-16 drones, which can also be flown in a crewed mode for training and other purposes, typically have a lifespan of around 300 flight hours in total post-conversion. The cost to turn F-16 into a Zombie Viper has generally been between $1 and $2 million over the years. The service has used other converted combat jets for this role, including QF-4 Phantoms, as seen in the videos below, as FSATs in the past. QF-16s operate from Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida, primarily in the ranges over the Gulf of Mexico (which the U.S. government now refers to as the Gulf of America). Zombie Vipers are also based at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, mainly to support activities at the U.S. Army's White Sands Missile Range. QF-16s are used for a variety of test and evaluation work, including the development of new weapons, as well as training events like Combat Archer live-fire air-to-air exercises. You can read more about the QF-16 in this past TWZ feature. 'The Air Force still considers the QF-16 expendable,' the Air Force spokesperson also told TWZ. There are no indications currently that the service is looking to convert more F-16s into Zombie Vipers to meet its FSAT needs into the next decade. Even if there was interest, it is not immediately clear where additional Viper airframes to turn into target drones might come from. A QF-16 with a pilot onboard for a crewed sortie. USAF TWZ has noted in the past that U.S. military stocks of older F-16s most suitable for conversion into FSATs have steadily dwindled over the years. At the same time, demands on the Air Force's operational Viper force have only increased at home and abroad. Turning new F-16s in storage into Zombie Vipers could be an option, but would not necessarily be the best use of airframes that could also be valuable sources of spare parts for operational jets, or even reactivated entirely to make up for attrition, especially in the event a major conflict breaks out. The U.S. Navy has also acquired ex-Air Force F-16s to support its adversary air program. Foreign air arms, including the Ukrainian Air Force, and private contractors that supply 'red air' aggressor services have been increasingly snatching up F-16s available on the more and more picked-over global second-hand market, or have been looking to do so, as well. Top Aces is the only private 'red air' contractor to currently operate F-16s in the aggressor role, one of which is seen here, but other firms have been looking into Vipers, as well. Jamie Hunter The Air Force, along with other branches of the U.S. military, have been trying for years now to acquire new full-size target drones, or ones that can at least mimic real fast-moving tactical jets. The goal has also been for those drones to have stealth and other more modern features, or the ability to simulate those capabilities with a high degree of fidelity. So far, however, progress in this regard has been extremely limited. Sierra Technical Services' 5GAT stealthy target drone seen here is a design the U.S. military has been at least testing for some time now. Sierra Technical Services A previous 5GAT design developed by Sierra Technical Services. Sierra Technical Services 'The Air Force has not identified or funded a full-scale aerial target replacement' for the QF-16, the service spokesperson told TWZ. In the meantime, potential adversaries, especially China, continue to field ever-more advanced aircraft, including stealthy types, crewed and uncrewed, and missiles. Just in December, two previously unseen Chinese stealth combat jet designs emerged. Additional demand for fifth-generation-representative aerial targets, especially to support the development of new munitions and sensors, has already been growing. These are needs QF-16s cannot really meet, though Zombie Vipers have been used to support testing of the new AIM-260 air-to-air missile. There is also just the overall target drone capacity question given the amount of expected missile testing the U.S. military is looking at in the years to come. QF-16s can survive a hit from a missile without a warhead and be refurbished for re-use. Missiles also do not necessarily need to hit a target to successfully score a 'kill' in testing or to meet other test objectives. The Air Force is also expecting to keep a pocket fleet of F-117 Nighthawk combat jets flying through at least 2034 to help meet demand for stealthy aerial targets for testing and training purposes, but these aircraft are not expendable at all. An F-117, with its drag chute deployed, after landing at Fresno-Yosemite International Airport in California in support of training exercise on Sept. 13, 2021. USAF There has also been talk about whether the Air Force's Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drone program could create a new pipeline for stealthy target drones. This could come in the form of target drone derivatives of CCA designs or simply expending actual CCAs in this role at the end of their service lives, which are expected to be relatively short. When any of that might be realized remains to be seen as the Air Force still has yet to finalize a plan for acquiring its first tranche of operational CCAs, deliveries of which are not expected to start until later this decade at the earliest. In the meantime, the Air Force will continue to rely on Zombie Vipers to provide important full-size targets, and ones it can blow up if desired, for testing and training purposes.

Bladed Hellfire Missile Seen In Action For The First Time	U.S. Central Command has posted the first video ever showing the secretive AGM-114R9X variant of the Hellfire missile in action. R9X is an exotic weapon that features an array of pop-out sword-like blades rather than a traditional high-explosive warhead. It is used as an extremely low collateral damage weapon that can target not just a vehicle, but a specific occupant inside by slashing through the car at just the right spot. TWZ was the first to identify this new weapon's unique effects back in 2017. It has since become something of a gruesome fascination in the public domain, getting nicknames like the 'Flying Ginsu' and 'Ninja Bomb' due to its very unique capabilities. The caption of the CENTCOM video reads: CENTCOM Forces Kill the Senior Military Leader of Al-Qaeda Affiliate Hurras al-Din (HaD) in Syria On Feb. 23, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) forces conducted a precision airstrike in Northwest Syria, targeting and killing Muhammed Yusuf Ziya Talay, the senior military leader of the terrorist organization Hurras al-Din (HaD), an Al-Qaeda affiliate. The airstrike is part of CENTCOM's ongoing commitment, along with partners in the region, to disrupt and degrade efforts by terrorists to plan, organize, and conduct attacks against civilians and military personnel from the U.S., our allies, and our partners throughout the region and beyond. 'As we have said in the past, we will continue to relentlessly pursue these terrorists in order to defend our homeland, and U.S., allied, and partner personnel in the region,' said Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla, commander, U.S. Central Command.

(Screenshot via X) The AGM-114R9X was developed in secret and has been used increasingly over the last eight years, including in very high-profile operations, without official acknowledgement of its existence. It is thought to be a weapon of choice for targeted assassinations using MQ-9 Reaper drones operated by the shadowy Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC). The missile also likely features a unique guidance capability that leverages automation in order to strike so precisely on just one part of a vehicle. The targeting FLIR footage seen in the CENTCOM video does show a locked vehicle (the bracket) and a set of crosshairs right over where the R9X was targeted, which could point to how this targeting process is executed, although it is not definitive at this time. The fact that the Pentagon released a video showing this weapon in action could indicate that we may finally find out official details about the R9X and its origins.

Cracks In KC-46 Tankers Halt All Deliveries	The Air Force will inspect its entire fleet of 89 KC-46A Pegasus aerial refueling tankers after cracks were found on two of the four new planes set to be sent to the Military Delivery Center, the Air Force told The War Zone exclusively. The issue was discovered by Boeing, which makes the jets, the Air Force said. In addition, Boeing 'is taking measures to temporarily halt deliveries until we fully understand the root cause and implement an effective corrective action plan,' the Air Force stated in response to our query about the latest problems with the troubled Pegasus program.

Devin Rumbaugh) Staff Sgt. Devin Rumbaugh After the inspection, if any cracks are found, 'the aircraft will undergo repairs before flying again,' the Air Force explained. 'The cracks were not found on any flight surfaces or hinges, but rather on the primary or secondary structures,' the Air Force told us. Boeing told us it is working to fix the problem. 'We are working closely with the customer to assess a potential issue on KC-46A aircraft and to mitigate any potential impact to the fleet and in-production airplanes,' the company told The War Zone after our inquiry about the cracks. The Pegasus program has been beset by problems even before they were delivered. It was years behind schedule before the flying branch received its first KC-46A in January 2019. As we previously reported, efforts are still ongoing to fix long-standing and serious problems with not only the KC-46’s boom but also the Remote Vision System that boom operators use to guide it into receiving aircraft. These are just two of the many issues that have impacted the program. Boeing is currently under contract to address issues with stiffness in the boom on the KC-46, a fix that involves hardware and software changes. As for the Remote Vision System, or RVS, the contractor is integrating an entirely new version of this into the tanker. The decision was taken after multiple problems with the original RVS, which was found to be potentially dangerous to use as well as potentially risking making boom operators physically ill.

Tillman and Ramirez removed the panels to access the flight control actuators for a visual inspection and to lubricate all the mechanical components. (U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Alexi Bosarge) Senior Airman Alexi Bosarge A scathing Fiscal Year 2024 DOTE report found that the KC-46A was 'not meeting many of its suitability metrics.' 'The operational availability (≥80percent threshold) and mission capable rate (≥90 percent threshold) slightly decreased throughout FY24, well below their threshold requirements,' the report found. Moreover, when accounting for partially mission-capable aircraft that are unable to perform their primary [aerial refueling] mission (e.g., due to a broken boom), the effective mission-capable rate falls an additional 24 percent on average. The program continues to suffer from prolonged maintenance repair times due to supply issues with parts needed for repair.' In March 2024, 'the KC-46A program experienced a two-month delay in delivering new aircraft due to the discovery of a broken part associated with the boom,' the report continued. 'Inspections of aircraft off the production line found a broken gimbal nut lockwire, a part important for the directional movement of the refueling boom.'

All known boom-equipped aircraft built to date are configured in this same general way. USAF All these problems have cost Boeing a lot of money. In January, the 'company revealed fourth quarter charges include a $800 million loss on Pegasus, reflecting what the company said were higher-than-estimated manufacturing costs,' Breaking Defense reported at the time. Boeing 'attributed part of that loss to the September strike of its Seattle-area machinist union, which resulted in a seven week production halt on jetliners such as twin-aisled 767 from which the KC-46 is derived,' Breaking Defense added. The company has lost billions on the KC-46 fixed price contract since its execution. U.S. Airmen tour a KC-46 Pegasus July 15 at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana.

Bunker Talk: Let’s Talk About All The Things We Did And Didn’t Co...	Welcome to Bunker Talk. This is a weekend open discussion post for the best commenting crew on the net, in which we can chat about all the stuff that went on this week that we didn’t cover. We can also talk about the stuff we did or whatever else grabs your interest. In other words, it’s an off-topic thread. The caption to this week’s top shot reads: BAD NEUENAHR-AHRWEILER, GERMANY - MAY 03: The command central of the Cold War-era former West German government bunker pictured on May 03, 2023 near Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler, Germany. The bunker, built at the site of a railway tunnel inside hills, had the capacity to sleep 936 people, had over 800 office rooms and would have served as a shelter to keep the West German government functioning in the event of war. Russia's current war in Ukraine and its recent stationing of nuclear missiles in Belarus has revived memories of the Cold War. Both West and East Germany had extensive bunker systems that Germany's post-reunification government chose to abandon in 2007, citing the post-Cold War era peace dividend and claiming that bunkers would be largely useless in the event of a nuclear war anyway.

Washington-Kyiv Relations Implode Spectacularly	The much-anticipated U.S. mineral deal with Ukraine was canceled and the future of Washington's support for Kyiv is now in question after U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance engaged in an unprecedentedly heated argument with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Following the blowup at an Oval Office press engagement, Zelensky and his team were ordered to leave the White House. The tumultuous turn of events came after Zelensky traveled to Washington, planning to sign a deal that would give the U.S. access to his country's mineral wealth. It was one component of Trump's plan to secure a peace deal to end the all-out war, now going into its fourth year. But, after the better part of an hour of relatively cordial talk, the wheels came off spectacularly as the press gaggle descended into a shouting match. The discussion grew angrier after Vance told Zelensky, 'I think it’s disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media.' When Zelensky tried to object, Trump grew agitated and raised his voice. 'Right now&#8230;you’re gambling with the lives of millions of people,' Trump told Zelensky. 'You’re gambling with World War III. You’re gambling with World War III. And what you’re doing is very disrespectful to the country. It’s backed you far more than a lot of people said they should have.' You can see the final 10 minutes of that meeting in the following video.

'I don’t want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.' The White House released a statement saying Trump and Vance were 'standing up for Americans' during the Oval Office exchange with Zelensky.

Zelensky's hasty departure from the White House under far from ideal conditions comes as his troops are facing a tough fight across 600 miles of front lines and a decreasing salient in Russia's Kursk region. Though European officials have promised to step up and support Ukraine, the U.S. remains Kyiv's primary backer. What comes next is unclear. On one hand, this could give Trump and his supporters in Congress the opening they need to exit the conflict entirely, a move that would send a sharp chill through the already frosty relationship with America's European allies. A potential cut-off of U.S. arms to Ukraine would be disastrous, not just in terms of the supply of new weapons but supporting those that are already used in action there. Such an opening would be a major lift for Moscow, although it could prompt Europe to enter into more of a wartime footing in a snap attempt to fill what would become increasingly widening gaps in Ukraine's military machine as time goes on. As for the U.S., the meeting will certainly have global impacts outside of Europe as allies and enemies alike try to predict how Washington will react to circumstances that directly impact their nations going forward. When it comes to any peace deal, that seems far less likely than it did this morning, although things can change once again. Considering how much is at stake here, both Ukraine and the U.S. could come back to the table in order to move the process forward, despite Zelensky and Trump's disagreements.

Warships Caked In Rust Prompting Late Night Trump Texts To Navy S...	President Donald Trump, through his pick to be the next Secretary of the Navy, has thrust long-running criticisms of what is commonly called 'running rust' on American warships back into the mainstream limelight. Navy Secretary nominee John Phelan told Senators yesterday that he gets late-night text messages from Trump complaining about the issue. Unaddressed rust and corrosion on Navy ships has downstream effects on maintenance and readiness, as well as less quantifiable impacts from how the service presents itself publicly at home and abroad. John Phelan, a long-time businessman and prominent Trump donor with no prior military experience, testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee about how he would run the Department of the Navy at a confirmation hearing yesterday. If confirmed as Secretary of the Navy, Phelan would also be the top civilian official in charge of the U.S. Marine Corps. 'I jokingly say President Trump has texted me numerous times very late at night, sometimes after one [o'clock] in the morning' about 'rusty ships or ships in a yard, asking me what am I doing about it,' Phelan said in response to a question from Angus King, an independent Senator from Maine. 'I'm not confirmed yet and have not been able to do anything about it, but I will be very focused on it.' Full clip: pic.twitter.com/g3KkBCZUND&mdash; John Ʌ Konrad V (@johnkonrad) February 27, 2025 'Please don't give that to President Trump because I'll get a text at like one in the morning,' Phelan also said after Senator Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, showed a picture of the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Dewey coming into port in Singapore last week. Senator Rick Scott asks Secretary of the Navy nominee John Phelan a question at yesterday's confirmation hearing.

Dewey's outward appearance, which appears to be significantly worse looking on the port side than the starboard one, had already drawn new criticism around the 'running rust' issue from commentators on social media.

Rust and corrosion, which are exacerbated by persistent exposure to salt water, can cause serious structural integrity and other problems, something the Navy does not deny. 'The harsh environment in which we operate degrades our ships, and our Sailors work hard to address corrosion along with all the maintenance and crew training required to sustain our Navy’s warfighting readiness,' a Navy spokesperson told TWZ back in 2021 in response to questions about 'running rust' on the highly advanced stealth destroyer USS Zumwalt.

This, in turn, can translate to more lengthy and costly maintenance periods and decreases in overall readiness. Keeping the ship in tip top shape!

As a result, those ships had fewer opportunities to more seriously address rust and corrosion. This had also put new emphasis on longer-standing debates about Navy safety regulations, which impose limits on the kinds of maintenance work that crews can do, especially at sea, as well as past switches to less toxic paints and coatings that critics say wear more readily. 'NAVSEA [Naval Sea Systems Command] has worked successfully for decades to improve the corrosion-control performance of coatings while simultaneously reducing the adverse impact of coatings on the environment. In the 1990s, Navy tank coatings had a performance life of five to seven years, but emitted paint solvents when applied,' a spokesperson for the command told Naval News in 2023 in response to questions about how new paints and coatings, specifically, had factored into the 'running rust' issue. 'NAVSEA worked with domestic and foreign commercial coating manufacturers to develop ultrahigh solids epoxy tank coatings that do not contain any paint solvent. Since these coatings were first applied in the early 2000s, many coated tanks have remained corrosion-free for 15 to 20 years. These coatings are required on all Navy ships and have contributed to extending the drydocking periodicities.' All of this rolls into the Navy's larger and very serious struggles with maintaining its ships and submarines, which have been well documented over the years, and is something TWZ has covered extensively. 'Our prior work found that the condition of the naval shipyards is poor, and their capital equipment is generally past its useful life. Their dry docks are unable to support newer ship classes, such as the Ford class aircraft carrier and some Virginia class attack submarines, and are vulnerable to flooding and seismic risks,' the Government Accountability Office (GAO), a Congressional watchdog, said in a new report released just yesterday. 'In addition, the shipyards’ inefficient layouts contribute to thousands of days of maintenance delay for aircraft carriers and submarines. Absent improvements, the shipyards will be unable to support about a third of the Navy’s planned maintenance availabilities for aircraft carriers and submarines through 2040.' Shipyard capacity for maintenance, or a lack thereof, also reflects broader concerns about the ability of the U.S. shipbuilding industry to meet the Navy's current and future needs. The Navy itself has previously briefed members of Congress on the extremely worrisome disparity in shipyard capacity between the United States and China, the latter being America's current chief global competitor. The Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) has previously assessed that Chinese shipbuilders are 200 percent more capable of producing warships and submarines than their counterparts in the United States. The Navy has been trying for years now to help facilitate an expansion of the U.S. industrial base. The service has also been looking to see where foreign firms in allied and partner nations may be able to help provide additional capacity. A ONI briefing slide from circa 2023 showing the gross disparity between Chinese and U.S. shipbuilding capacity. ONI All of this has been further compounded in recent years by often extended deployments for ships and submarines across the Navy's currently shrinking overall force structure, as well as recruiting and other manpower challenges. Last year, a bipartisan group of legislators introduced a broad-sweeping proposal to try to address many of these issues dubbed the Shipbuilding and Harbor Infrastructure for Prosperity and Security (SHIPS) for America Act, which you can read more about here. At the time of writing, the SHIPS for America Act has progressed little through the legislative process. At yesterday's hearing, Secretary of the Navy nominee Phelan was also grilled on these larger issues. He said he would bring a new 'sense of urgency' to shipbuilding and shipyard related matters if confirmed. The matter of 'running rust' on ships, specifically, has other important, if more subjective impacts. As highlighted by the USS Dewey recent stopover in Singapore, U.S. warships in foreign ports are very public symbols of American military prowess and general global influence. As such, the being well kept, especially externally, carries additional significance. There may also be negative impacts to general morale. 'It's terrible. I think they should be ashamed,' Phelan said at the hearing yesterday when shown the picture of the Dewey. 'Would you want to go on that ship?' John Phelan at yesterday's confirmation hearing. Senate Armed Services Committee capture Trump already has his own history of opining on the general aesthetics of Navy warships. 'The ships that they were building, they looked terrible,' Trump said during a speech at the Fincantieri Marinette Marine shipyard in Wisconsin at the tail end of his first term in 2020. 'I said, 'That’s a terrible-looking ship. Let’s make it beautiful. It’ll cost you the same, and maybe less.'' 'I said, 'This is not a good-looking ship. Let’s change the design of it.' And I got people in, and we looked at different designs,' Trump continued. 'And as long as we’re going to do it — and look at what you’re doing, how beautiful it is. They gave me a beautiful model that’s absolutely — it’s like a yacht with missiles on it.' Trump was talking at that time about what is now known as the Constellation class frigate, which is derived from the Fregata Europea Multi-Missione (FREMM), or European Multi-Mission Frigate, developed jointly by France and Italy. The Navy has been roundly criticized since then for extensive changes to the Constellation design, which now shares relatively little with its Franco-Italian parent, leading to significant cost growth, delays, and technical issues, as you can read more about here. A rendering of the future Constellation class frigate USS Lafayette. USN Former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, who served during Trump's first term, also wrote in his 2022 book A Sacred Oath: Memoirs of a Secretary of Defense During Extraordinary Times that the President was highly critical of the look of U.S. warships, especially the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford. Esper said that Trump described unspecified Russian and Italian designs as looking 'nicer, sleeker, like a real ship,' as well. What new steps Phelan might take to address rust and corrosion on American warships, as well as the other shipyard-related issues facing the Navy, if confirmed as service's next top civilian, remain to be seen. He is already facing pressure from President Trump to do more.

F-35B Has Flown With Meteor Long-Range Air-To-Air Missile	For the first time, an F-35B has flown armed with the Meteor beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile. Test flights with the missile were a long time coming, but they will pave the way for a major leap in capability for the stealth fighter. British and Italian F-35s will eventually combine the ramjet-powered missile with enhancements under the Block 4 upgrade, including for the aircraft’s radar, which will make the Meteor an even more potent addition to their armory. The U.K. Royal Air Force announced today that an F-35B has made the first test flights with inert Meteor missiles. The F-35B used was a U.S. Marine Corps example from the Integrated Test Force at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland. So far, 'multiple sorties' have been carried out to gather environmental data as part of the campaign to integrate the Meteor onto the F-35. According to captions provided with related imagery, the first Meteor sortie was flown by F-35B test aircraft BF-18, piloted by Royal Navy Lt. Cdr. Nicholas Baker, on November 20, 2024.

Crown Copyright Dane Wiedmann Photos published by the Royal Air Force show the Meteor — which has cropped fins for internal carriage — inside one of the two weapons bays of the F-35B, alongside an AIM-120 AMRAAM. The latter weapon is the F-35’s current standard beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile, and the Meteor was designed from the outset to have better range and overall kinematic performance than the U.S.-made missile. A close-up of the Meteor and AMRAAM in the weapons bay. Both missiles are inert. Crown Copyright In a media release, Air Commodore Al Roberts, the Royal Air Force’s Head of Air-to-Air Missiles, said: 'This milestone is a testament to the effective collaboration between the multinational governmental and industrial partnerships that we have in place. Inclusion of Meteor onto the Lightning II will bring this formidable air combat capability to the U.K. and to the burgeoning F-35 community, significantly enhancing security among allies.' Crown Copyright Eventually, the Meteor will be used by the short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) F-35B flown by the United Kingdom and Italy, as well as the conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) F-35A operated by Italy. The fighters will carry a maximum of four Meteors, all internally, preserving the aircraft’s stealth characteristics.

Previously, the U.K. government had said that British F-35Bs would be armed with Meteor by the 'middle of this decade,' while a date of 2027 at the earliest had also been given in a government report dated February 2022. Drop pit testing of AMRAAM, SDB-II, and METEOR from F-35 pic.twitter.com/RKdVnlpigQ&mdash; Doha (@Doha104p3) January 5, 2025 The Meteor, which is already in service on British Eurofighter Typhoons and which completed operational testing and evaluation (OT&E) on Italian Eurofighters in late 2023, is a weapon that TWZ has discussed in detail in the past. A U.K. Royal Air Force Typhoon takes off, loaded with Meteor missiles below the fuselage. Crown Copyright The standout feature of the Meteor is its novel propulsion system, based on a solid-fuel, variable-flow, ducted rocket — better known as a ramjet. This kind of motor can be throttled during different phases of flight. This means it still has sufficient energy during the terminal attack — when traditional air-to-air missile motors are normally losing energy and, therefore, agility. Thanks to its propulsion system, the Meteor’s all-important ‘no-escape zone’ is much larger than for comparable weapons. This means the enemy’s chance of evading the missile at the endgame of the engagement, using high-energy maneuvering, is considerably reduced. Another advantage of the being able to throttle the motor is that the Meteor’s autopilot can calculate the most efficient route to the target for very long-range shots. As with most contemporary air-to-air missiles, the maximum range of the Meteor is a closely guarded secret. However, most sources agree that it can likely engage targets out to around 130 miles from its launch platform. Whatever the case, like any air-to-air missile, its range is highly dependent on a variety of factors, including the track of the target and the height and speed of the launch aircraft. A model of the Meteor (with the original full-span fins) is displayed during the Farnborough International Airshow in July 2022 in Farnborough, England. Photo by John Keeble/Getty Images John Keeble Along with its ramjet motor, the Meteor boasts a two-way datalink, supplementing the missile’s active X-band radar seeker. The datalink provides the missile with inflight updates as it flies out to the target, feeding it mid-course guidance updates from third-party sources as well as from the launch aircraft. Meanwhile, the pilot in the launch aircraft can use the datalink to get information on the Meteor’s fuel, energy, and tracking state. That can help determine if and when to fire another, disengage, or even assign a different target of opportunity. All of this makes the Meteor a formidable weapon for a fourth-generation fighter, but it will really come into its own when integrated with the F-35. To start with, the F-35 has an unrivaled sensor suite, meaning it can provide more accurate and timely targeting data to the Meteor. At the same time, thanks to the Meteor’s datalink, the missile can also receive mid-course updates from other sources. In fact, the F-35 might not need to use its radar at all to engage the target, meaning it can maximize its stealth attributes. It should be noted that the AIM-120D AMRAAM also has a two-way datalink with third-party targeting capabilities, although it lacks the performance advantage conferred by the ramjet motor. A stock shot of two AIM-120 AMRAAMs in one of the F-35B’s two bays. The aircraft seen here belongs to the Royal Air Force in the United Kingdom. Crown Copyright It can be easily imagined how, using its low-observability characteristics, powerful integrated sensors, and advanced networked information systems, the F-35 can go into aerial combat and ‘see and not be seen.’ The Meteor will meanwhile allow it to engage aerial targets at very long range, including destroying hostile aircraft long before they even know that a hostile fighter is present. Holding the enemy at risk at longer range is becoming more important as advanced infrared search and track (IRST) systems — which are notably aimed at detecting stealthy aircraft — improve and proliferate. . The Meteor is intended to harness the improvements that the F-35 will bring as part of a massive upgrade initiative known as Block 4. Central to the enhancements is a new multifunction active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar designated as AN/APG-85, which will be coupled with advanced electronic warfare capabilities. The new radar should be able to engage targets at significantly greater ranges and provide improved resolution. This should really come into its own in the kinds of long-range engagements for which the Meteor is optimized. The upgrade will also include a huge enhancement to the F-35's already potent electronic warfare system, and it will address the F-35’s Distributed Aperture System (DAS) and Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS). The EOTS provides an infrared search and track functionality, which is set to be drastically improved as part of the Block 4 upgrade. Confusingly, while the United Kingdom in 2023 said it planned to retrofit Block 4 across its entire F-35 fleet, as well as incorporate new build examples of the aircraft acquired in the future, it had previously hinted that only a portion of the existing fleet might undergo the upgrade. Regardless, it’s not entirely clear how realistic — or affordable — it would be to integrate Block 4 and the related hardware and software for some of its earliest deliveries. Nevertheless, to provide for the integration of Meteor (as well as SPEAR 3 and the penetrator version of the Paveway IV), the Block 4 upgrade will be necessary. In fact, delays to Block 4 have very likely impacted the timeline for introducing Meteor to operational F-35s, which has slipped to the right. After all, Block 4 relies upon a new suite of hardware and software, known as Technology Refresh-3 (TR-3), which modernizes the F-35’s core processor, memory unit, panoramic cockpit display system, and related avionics. TR-3 has been billed as the F-35’s new ‘computer backbone,’ since it promises to provide 25 times more computing power than the existing TR-2 computing system, but its development has been dogged by problems. These issues left new F-35s being parked up and not delivered after they were built, a situation that lasted for roughly a year. Adding the Meteor to the F-35 reflects broader trends in aerial combat, stressing the value of increasingly long-ranged air-to-air missiles. The United Kingdom is already looking at a Meteor successor for its future Tempest combat aircraft, while, in recent months, the U.S. Navy has introduced, at least on a limited level, an air-launched version of the Standard Missile-6 (SM-6) under the AIM-174B designation. Of immediate relevance to the F-35 is another long-range air-to-air missile, the AIM-260, also known as the Joint Advanced Tactical Missile (JATM). The JATM, details about which are still highly classified, is expected to ultimately supplant the AMRAAM, and, crucially, the F-35A and F-35C should be able to carry six examples. All these developments are being driven primarily by the emergence of ever more capable very long-range air-to-air missiles in China and Russia. A Russian Su-35S launches an R-37M air-to-air missile. According to data from the manufacturer, the R-37M, at least in its export form, can defeat 'some types' of aerial targets at a range of up to 124 miles. Russian Ministry of Defense screencap Meanwhile, for the United Kingdom in particular, there are also questions about how many F-35s they will actually buy. Before the end of this year, the United Kingdom is set to receive the last deliveries from its initial order of 48 aircraft, known as Tranche 1. Originally, plans called for a total of 138 F-35Bs, although consistent budgetary concerns have led to an apparent rethink, and there now seems little prospect that this will be realized.

Crown Copyright There are meanwhile plans to place a Tranche 2 order for 27 F-35Bs, which will provide a total fleet size of 74 aircraft, although this is still to be signed off. Regardless, a fleet of around 74 is the bare minimum needed to properly meet aspirations for the U.K.’s carrier-based air wing. Beyond that, however, the U.K. Ministry of Defense has urged caution, saying only that it remains open to the possibility of purchasing further F-35s beyond the 74 now specified. However many F-35s the United Kingdom eventually buys, the forthcoming introduction of the Meteor will bring a significant boost to the stealth fighter’s already impressive air combat capabilities.

New Scout Unit That Heavily Leverages Drones, Electronic Warfare ...	Last month, a group of 80 U.S. Army soldiers in a recently formed unit used attack and reconnaissance drones, electronic warfare (EW) equipment, and support from anti-tank weapons, mortarmen and snipers to evaluate a new way to detect and engage enemy forces. Dubbed the Multi Purpose Company (MPC), the unit was created under the Army’s Transformation in Contact (TIC) program designed to speed up the process by which soldiers get the equipment and doctrine they need to fight modern wars. The concept was informed by lessons from the ongoing war in Ukraine, now in its fourth year. The MPC 'integrates [drone] capability with long-range fires with EW all in the same organization,' Army Lt. Gen. Charles Costanza, commanding general of V Corps, told The War Zone during a reporter roundtable at the Association of the U.S. Army annual conference in Washington, D.C. last year. 'That's really coming straight out of watching what's going on in Ukraine.' The MPC concept was evaluated by troops from the 10th Mountain Division’s 3rd Combat Brigade Team (3BCT), known as 'The Patriots,' during Exercise Combined Resolve 25-1 at the Joint Multinational Readiness Center in Hohenfels, Germany. A soldier aims a Advanced Anti-Tank Weapon System-Medium, FGM- 148 Javelin during the defense from tank lane during an exercise. (U.S. Army photo by Pfc. Jadyn Merritt) Pfc. Jadyn Merritt 'You can look at it as like a movement-to-contact type company,' Army Maj. Matthew Marshall, the division’s Force Management Officer, told The War Zone exclusively. 'Basically, this is the smallest element out front of the battalion and the brigade, looking to find and fix the enemy forces. As necessary, they have the capacity and capability through mortars, through anti-tank weapons and through other augmentation to bring combat power to bear to defeat or attrit enemy forces.' The goal is to peel away several layers of command 'to decrease the amount of time from eyes on the target to lethal effects,' Marshall said. Augmented by an EW team and a Fire Support Team (FiST), the MPC conducted reconnaissance with ground, aerial, and electromagnetic sensors, the Army pointed out. The MPC concept calls for these soldiers to operate a short distance ahead of the rest of the brigade, Marshall added. 'There is nothing in doctrine right now, because this is a test concept, but our initial best guesstimate is that we're looking at roughly like three to four kilometers in front of the main body,' he said. That’s based on 'our analysis of what capabilities - both from indirect fires and our new Anduril Ghost UAS - that they're utilizing.' For the testing, the MPC was divided into three platoons, Marshall explained. The scout platoon, with about 31 soldiers, was made up of scout snipers and troops using Javelin anti-tank weapons and other weapons capabilities, as well as PDW’s C-100 surveillance drones, according to Marshall. The scout platoons operate nine-passenger ISV-9s (infantry squad vehicles that it is evaluating. The Patriots used and evaluated the Army's new nine-passenger Infantry Support Vehicle. (Patriots) The mortar platoon, with about 23 soldiers, has Humvees and trailers, 120 millimeter mortars, and a fire direction sergeant to help coordinate indirect fire with the scouts. The Lethal Unmanned Systems (LUS) platoon, with about 26 soldiers, uses Switchblade 600 loitering munitions as strike weapons and Anduril Ghost drones for surveillance. It is also equipped with Stingers MANPADS and Drone Defenders to counter adversary drones. The MPC platoons were augmented by two other units. One was a four-person EW team using Beast+ jamming systems. The other was a FiST, made up of a Fire Support Officer, a Fire Support Non-Commissioned Officer, and three radio operators. They boosted the MPC’s ability to call in artillery and other fire support. 'So if you can envision the flow, you would have your UAS out front,' Marshall told us. 'Behind that, you would have your scout platoon, and then behind that, you would have your mortars and then behind that you would have the rest of the battalion.' Mortarmen from the 3rd Brigade Combat Team in action. (Patriots) Decidedly absent from the testing was the use of first-person view (FPV) attack drones that have become ubiquitous on both sides of the war in Ukraine. 'I can't speak to the thought process or the rationality behind the drones or what's going on in Ukraine,' Marshall said. The MPC was tested to see if it could replace capabilities lost when the Army underwent a major restructuring last year to move toward Large Scale Combat Operations, Marshall noted. Among other things, the service did away with the Infantry Brigade Combat Team (ICBT) Cavalry Squadrons. 'The Army also made a decision to remove the [drones] that were organic to the brigade, such as the Shadows and the Ravens, to make way for future capabilities at echelon,' he stated. Army Deputy Chief of Staff Lt. Gen Joseph A. Ryan looks at the view from a drone controller. (Patriots) Originally called a Strike Company, MPC was born last year out of the need to 'maximize the Infantry Brigade Combat Team construct…by meeting the intent of the Army' in the wake of that restructuring, Marshall stated. In Army speak, it was called ARSTRUC 25-29. The Strike Company name was changed as part of an overall Army naming convention effort. The Army was 'looking at getting leaner, lighter and more lethal,' Marshall said. The service, he added, was investigating how it could 'maintain that value within the confines of what the Army has given us. And so through our analysis, that's how we arrived at the Multi Purpose Company. A U.S. Army soldier assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 2nd Infantry Regiment, searches for simulated enemy forces during Exercise Combined Resolve 25-1 at the Hohenfels Training Area, Joint Multinational Readiness Center, Germany, January 29, 2025. (U.S. Army Sgt. Donovon Lynch) The timeline for determining how well the MPC concept works is up in the air, Marshall noted. However, though the testing concluded, it will live on in the brigade, he suggested. The Army 'has directed that their support of divisions look for a means to continue to test and prototype organizations such as this Multi Purpose Company concept,' he told us. 'As of right now, there is no intent from the division or the brigade to dismantle the Multi Purpose Company within 3rd Brigade, so they will continue to go to training exercises, collective training, etc, with this construct that they're currently in.' Two other divisions, the 101st and the 25th, are evaluating similar units. That was all ordered under the previous Biden administration. President Donald Trump has ordered his new Defense Secretary, Pete Hegseth, to conduct a sweeping review of all Pentagon programs. Whether the Army’s new leadership will still want to continue this program remains to be seen, but it does fit in with the idea of a more agile, flexible, and lethal force dynamic that is better fit for tomorrow’s wars, which appears to pair with what Hegseth is looking to achieve.

F-15 Nose-Mounted Infrared Search And Track Sensor Hinted At In N...	A new photo published by Boeing shows one of its F-15 Advanced Eagle series fighters fitted with what looks like a previously unseen infrared search and track (IRST) sensor ahead of the cockpit. While F-15s already use IRST sensors in service, so far, operational IRSTs have been limited to pods and pylon-installed types. An internal version installed atop the nose would offer several key advantages. The photo in question was recently published by Boeing on the social media site X. It was not captioned but presented to illustrate a media release concerning a contract awarded to Boeing’s subsidiary, Tapestry Solutions. The contract will provide the Air Force with mission-planning software solutions for a variety of combat aircraft types, including the F-15. A close-up of the photo published by Boeing on X, showing the apparent IRST installation ahead of the windshield. Boeing The F-15 in the photo is fully in shadow but has the various hallmarks of one of Boeing’s F-15 Advanced Eagle fighters, although it’s not immediately clear which particular variant it is or whether it’s a company testbed, which would seem most likely. However, the most notable visible feature of the aircraft is the small fairing ahead of the windshield, which is almost certainly an IRST sensor. At the same time, there’s no way to know whether the fairing is a real-life IRST sensor that was fitted for testing of some kind or whether it’s a mock-up of a possible sensor housing. Boeing has responded to our inquiry and confirmed it is indeed real and not a Photoshop representation. At the very least, it would indicate that Boeing has been looking at the possibility of installing this kind of technology directly in its latest F-15 variants. As noted earlier, operational F-15s of different flavors have been fitted with IRSTs before, but not in this location. Derived from the AN/AAS-42 supplied for the F-14D Tomcat, an IRST known as Tiger Eyes is installed on some of the more modern Strike Eagle export models, including Singapore’s F-15SG and South Korea’s F-15K, being housed inside the left-hand intake pylon that carries the aircraft’s targeting pod. Tiger Eyes is also installed in export versions of the F-15 Advanced Eagle, namely Saudi Arabia’s F-15SA and Qatar’s F-15QA. An F-15SG from the Republic of Singapore Air Force. Tiger Eyes is installed inside the left-hand intake pylon. U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Patrick Sullivan Senior Airman Patrick Sullivan Also developed from the AN/AAS-42 is the AN/ASG-34, the sensor at the heart of the IRST21 system used in Lockheed Martin’s Legion Pod. You can read much more about the IRST21, its predecessors, and the capabilities IRST sensors offer, in general, here. As for the Legion Pod, this is used on U.S. Air Force F-15C ‘legacy’ Eagles and is also part of the sensor suite on the newer F-15EX Eagle II. The pod is carried on the centerline station below the fuselage. An F-15C Eagle from Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, flies over Alaska while carrying a Legion Pod during Exercise Northern Edge 2019. U.S. Air Force In June last year, the Air Force explained to TWZ that the Legion Pod was being evaluated on the F-15EX, with the plan to employ the system immediately after the jet entered Air National Guard squadron service. 'Legion is a sensor that operates in a different wave band to the radar,' explained Maj. Aaron 'Kamikazze' Eshkenazi, an F-15EX pilot assigned to the 85th Test and Evaluation Squadron (TES) 'Skulls' at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. 'It is long-wave infrared that helps you detect platforms outside of the X-band, which is typically where the radar is detecting. The F-15C units are already using Legion, and so the intent is to ensure that the F-15EX is able to carry and use that same pod.' A Legion Pod mounted under an F-15EX. Jamie Hunter In fact, there has been at least one previous effort to field a nose-mounted IRST on an F-15. This was a Japanese effort that led to the installation of an IRST on at least one F-15J, on an experimental basis. Rare F-15J Experimented With A IRST Sensor In 2008.Starting around May 2008, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries began testing the installation of the IRST (Infrared Search and Track) system on the F-15J as part of its modernization plan.

An artist’s impression of Japan’s F-15J upgrade, the Japan Super Interceptor (JSI). Boeing It’s also worth considering the possibility, far less likely, bordering on remote, that the sensor is something similar to the AN/AAQ-32 Internal FLIR Targeting System (IFTS) found on the United Arab Emirates F-16E/F Desert Falcon. This unique infrared targeting and navigation suite includes a FLIR system ahead of the windscreen that provides a video feed into the F-16E/F pilot’s head-up display, and it can also be shown on the displays in the rear cockpit of the F-model. It provides a superior forward view at night and in poor weather. The F-15 already has a similar option to IFTS available in the form of its AN/AAQ-13 LANTIRN navigation pod. The F-16E/F head-on, showing the sensor ball for the IFTS. Lockheed Martin/Code One In general, an IRST provides a pilot with an important additional way to detect and track other aircraft at significant ranges. Significantly, the IRST offers an alternative to the radar in electronic warfare-heavy (jamming) combat environments, and since it depends on the hostile aircraft’s infrared signature alone, it is unaffected by radar-evading design features on stealth aircraft. Furthermore, the IRST is able to spot, track, and help engage aircraft entirely passively. This eliminates the chance of alerting potential opponents that they’ve been detected, unlike radar, which can give away the attacking aircraft’s presence and even its location. In practical terms, an IRST allows the pilot to quickly spot and track multiple targets at far beyond visual range. It also provides actual targeting information so the pilot can engage threats using the IRST for targeting alone or in conjunction with other sensors, especially the radar, which offers important advantages. Lockheed Martin So far, however, production IRST sensors for F-15s are installed below the fuselage, either on a pylon or, in the case of Tiger Eyes, embedded in a pylon. While this kind of attachment is easier to integrate, it does have significant disadvantages, especially in terms of the field of regard. Simply put, having an IRST positioned on the top of the nose means it is much better able to look up, tracking threats above the F-15. This is of particular importance for higher-flying targets. At the same time, a sensor in this position also has a good field of view down and to either side, aided by the slope of the nose. Sensors below the jet do have some limitations due to being blocked by the aircraft's structure. While not as much of an issue for targets at long ranges, it is still a limitation. Additionally, having an integrally mounted IRST, wherever it may be located on the airframe, frees up an additional stores hardpoint when compared with the Legion Pod. This is of notable importance when magazine depth is at a premium — the ability of an aircraft to carry a considerable number of external weapons, something the F-15EX, in particular, is prized for. More so, it’s important for retaining the ability to carry a centerline fuel tank, which is a popular combat configuration for air superiority-tasked F-15s. It also means the jet would not need to carry its dedicated targeting pod pylon to accommodate the Tiger Eyes option. The big question is whether this apparent program was aimed at meeting a potential U.S. Air Force requirement or if it was geared toward export-oriented Advanced Eagles. With growing interest in IRST sensors, there are a variety of possibilities when it comes to Eagle operators who might be interested in such a product. At the same time, it appears that the Advanced Eagle in the photo has Missile Approach Warning System (MAWS) sensors, which are notably absent from the U.S. Air Force F-15EX. Advanced Eagles are still being ordered by foreign customers, most recently by Israel, which signed up for 25 F-15IA versions last November. An edited version of the same photo reveals the presence of a MAWS fairing on the side of the cockpit. Boeing Once again, at this early stage, we don’t know exactly why Boeing might have put an IRST — or a mock-up of one — on one of its F-15 Advanced Eagles. While we have asked Boeing for more information, there is no doubt that compelling arguments do exist for just such a feature.

OA-1K Light Attack Special Ops Aircraft Officially Named Skyraide...	The U.S. Air Force has formally dubbed its forthcoming OA-1K light attack aircraft as the Skyraider II. The name is a callback to the famed A-1 Skyraider, which Air Force units flew during the Vietnam War. The new moniker comes as questions are swirling around how the OA-1K will actually be employed as the U.S. military shifts away from counter-insurgency and other low-intensity missions to preparing for high-end fights. Air Force Special Operations Command's (AFSOC) leadership officially announced the OA-1K's new name at the Global SOF Foundation's Special Air Warfare Symposium today. The Skyraider II name had already leaked out in various places, but had not been formally confirmed. The OA-1K designation, which is non-standard and out-of-sequence within the U.S. military's joint service aircraft and missile designation system, is itself a clear reference to the original Skyraider. The A-1J was the last variant of that aircraft in U.S. service. The OA-1K's prime contractor, L3Harris, had previously marketed the aircraft as the Sky Warden, a name the company also said was meant to hearken back in part to the A-1. An OA-1K Skyraider II. USAF 'I am excited about the Skyraider II,' Air Force Lt. Gen. Michael Conley, commander of AFSOC, said in a statement. 'I think we have a capability that’s only ours, and we are going to have the ability to shape that into something that the rest of the nation might not even know they need right now.' The two-seat OA-1K can carry up to 6,000 pounds of munitions and other stores, including precision-guided missiles and bombs and podded sensor systems, on up to eight underwing pylons. L3Harris has previously said the aircraft can fly out to an area up to 200 miles away and loiter there for up to six hours with a typical combat load. They also have a 'robust suite of radios and datalinks providing multiple means for line-of-sight (LOS) and beyond line-of-sight (BLOS) communications,' according to the company. AFSOC currently plans to acquire 75 Skyraider IIs, with the first example to be delivered this Spring. The turboprop-powered OA-1K, a militarized derivative of the popular Air Tractor AT-802 crop duster, is a tail-dragging design like the much larger piston-engined Skyraider. The Skyraider II is set to be the first tail-dragging tactical combat aircraft anywhere in U.S. military inventory in decades. Douglas started development of the OA-1K's namesake, which was originally designated the AD Skyraider, as a carrier-based attack aircraft at the tail end of World War II. U.S. Navy and Marine Corps units used variants of the type extensively during the Korean War. The Skyraider notably offered significantly greater endurance and ordnance capacity – upwards of 10,000 pounds of munitions spread across up to 15 hardpoints under the wings and fuselage, along with four wing-mounted 20mm cannons – compared to jet aircraft coming into service at the same time. The Skyraider's increasingly anachronistic look among the rest of the U.S. military combat aircraft fleets led to it gaining the additional nickname 'Spad,' a reference to French-made SPAD biplanes that the U.S. Army Air Service, among others, flew during World War I. The Skyraider's large size and impressive maximum takeoff weight also led to the creation of specialized airborne early warning, electronic countermeasures, and anti-submarine warfare variants. Substantially redesigned versions with side-by-side seating for crew members in greatly expanded cockpits were also produced. With the U.S.-military-wide adoption of a standardized designation system for aircraft and missiles in 1962, the various Skyraider types became variants and subvariants of the A-1. The Navy and Marines continued to fly A-1s into the Vietnam War. The Air Force also acquired and flew hundreds of single and multi-seat Skyraider variants second-hand during the conflict in Southeast Asia. Air Force A-1s were heavily employed as escorts for helicopters during search and rescue missions, commonly referred to as the 'Sandy' mission, and in support of special operations forces. The Skyraider's ability to fly low and slow, as well as loiter for extended periods over a particular area, along with its large and diverse ordnance capacity, made it especially attractive for these roles. A US Air Force A-1E Skyraider, a multi-seat variant, flies together with an HH-3C helicopter during a combat search and rescue mission. USAF A single-seat A-1H Skyraider somewhere over Southeast Asia circa 1972. USAF Skyraiders also served with a number of foreign air arms over the years and remained in limited service into the 1980s in certain countries in Africa. What the future might hold now for the Skyraider II is somewhat murky. The OA-1K follows some two decades of largely abortive light attack aircraft projects and experiments conducted across the U.S. military largely in the context of the Global War on Terror (GWOT), particularly operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Those lower-intensity operations prompted persistent interest in exponentially cheaper alternatives to tactical combat jets, bombers, and other aircraft to provide close air support, armed overwatch, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) support, in permissive airspace. Light attack aircraft could also operate with smaller footprints and from sites closer to operating areas, even more far-flung ones, reducing the need for aerial refueling tanker and other support. This all, in turn, would also help free up other aircraft for more demanding and/or higher-priority missions, as well as just reduce costly wear and tear, especially on fast jets, from constant short-endurance sorties. The final decision to acquire the OA-1K in 2022 notably came after the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the general end of the GWOT-era. The expected roles and missions of the Skyraider II have now come under new scrutiny amid the more recent pivot toward preparing for future high-end fights, especially one in the Pacific against China. This includes a 2023 report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO), a Congressional watchdog, that noted U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) had 'not reevaluated its needs [for the OA-1K] despite changes to operational missions (such as the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan) and force structure reductions under consideration.' GAO has also called into question the logic of using resources freed up from the divestment of special operations U-28A Draco and Beechcraft King Air-based ISR aircraft to support the OA-1K's fielding. AFSOC and SOCOM have repeatedly insisted that what is now called the Skyraider II is not a direct replacement for either of those aircraft, and that additional platforms are being explored to meet future aerial intelligence-gathering needs. A Beechcraft King Air-based MC-12W Libery, in front, and a U-28A Draco, behind. Air National Guard Andrew LaMoreaux Interestingly, as part of the announcement of the Skyraider II name today, Air Force Brig. Gen. Craig Prather, AFSOC’s Director of Strategic Plans, Programs and Requirements, highlighted the OA-1K's potential to 'take on missions' along 'the southwest border' with Mexico. The use of U.S. military ISR aircraft, including highly capable strategic-focused Air Force RC-135V/W Rivet Joints and Navy P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol planes, to surveil parts of Mexico from U.S. and international airspace has surged under President Donald Trump. Prather also highlighted operations across Africa as potentially being in the OA-1K's future. There has also been talk in past about whether the Skyraider II could be used in more novel ways for crisis response and other missions. USAF 'From when OA-1K was conceptualized and decided on until now, the world’s changed a little bit,' Lt. Gen. Conley told TWZ and others at a media roundtable on the sidelines of the Air & Space Forces Association’s main annual conference last September. 'But as we move forward, I think there’s opportunity to look at, again, some novel mission sets. …how quick can we get the wings on and off it so we could use it in some sort of crisis response, if we needed to? Where does the role of SIGINT [signals intelligence], or ELINT [electronic intelligence] or… some sort of ISR collect [factor in] there. I think there’s opportunity for that. Again, not anything we’ve committed to yet.' 'I tell my team every day [that] the Pacific is incredibly important to us for all the reasons – you know, Secretary [of the Air Force Frank Kendall has put emphasis on] China, China, China – we get it,' he added at that time. 'But we’ve also got a rest of world mission that I’m responsible for, as well.' 'We still have a global mission. … I don’t think we’re done in CENTCOM,' he continued, referring to U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. military operations across the Middle East. 'And I think there’s probably some disconnects in how we analyze what the future fight will look like.' Another look at what has now been dubbed the Skyraider II. USAF There are additional questions now about the OA-1K's future amid significant expected cuts to existing programs across the U.S. military as part of a shift in resources to new priorities, including President Trump's Golden Dome missile defense initiative. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has initiated a review of spending plans for the 2026 Fiscal Year with a goal of freeing up eight percent, or approximately $50 billion, for reallocation. If nothing else, time will tell whether or not the OA-1K lives up to the storied heritage behind its new name.

USAF Air Base In England Is Nuclear Capable Again: Watchdog Repor...	Continued construction work on protective shelters at the air base of RAF Lakenheath in England provides conclusive evidence that the United States is poised to bring nuclear bombs back to the United Kingdom after nearly two decades, according to a new report. This comes as NATO’s leading European powers increasingly consider the possibility of some kind of cooperative nuclear umbrella independent of the United States, amid fears that Washington may dial back or even end the current nuclear-sharing program, something we have recently discussed. The evidence is presented in the report from the Federation of American Scientists (FAS), which has been monitoring the topic since April 2022, when the first official evidence emerged suggesting the reactivation of the nuclear mission at Lakenheath. An aerial photograph of RAF Lakenheath, home of the U.S. Air Force 48th Fighter Wing in September 2014. Photograph by David Goddard/Getty Images David Goddard It should be noted that, in recent months, Lakenheath came to wider prominence when a number of drones were spotted over and close to the base, something that TWZ was first to report after the Air Force confirmed the incident to us last November. It later emerged that similar drone incursions happened around the same time at nearby RAF Mildenhall and RAF Feltwell. FAS notes that, as of February 2025, 'there are no known public indications that nuclear weapons have been deployed to RAF Lakenheath,' although the writers of the report consider the U.S. Air Force 'is re-establishing its nuclear mission on U.K. soil for the first time in nearly two decades.' The report considers notable pieces of evidence gathered in the last couple of years that point quite clearly to the return of a potential nuclear mission to Lakenheath, whether as a backup or as a permanent fixture. Courtesy FAS Most obviously, satellite imagery shows the ongoing upgrades being made to Lakenheath’s Protective Aircraft Shelters, which incorporate underground WS3 vaults for the storage of nuclear bombs. This work began in 2022, and, to date, around 28 of the 33 aircraft shelters have been upgraded, with construction continuing on six more. Courtesy FAS/Google Earth Satellite imagery also reveals new tarmac infrastructure related to the arrival of two squadrons of U.S. Air Force F-35A stealth fighters at the base. Although this, on its own, doesn’t point to the nuclear mission’s return, the same upgrades have been made at other air bases in Europe that are known to host U.S. nuclear weapons.

This first came up in the NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP) budget for Fiscal Year 2023, which included the United Kingdom on a list of bases receiving upgrades to their 'special storage' sites. The only candidate for this would be Lakenheath. A Weapons Storage and Security System vault in raised position holding an earlier model of B61 nuclear bomb. The vault is within a Protective Aircraft Shelter. Public Domain/Wikimedia Commons Upgrades at the same base were also mentioned in other public documents, one of which describes a new 'surety dormitory' at the base. The Air Force document notes that the dormitory is needed to accommodate additional airmen at the base because of 'the arrival of a potential Surety Mission.' In Pentagon parlance, 'surety' typically refers to the safety and security of nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, U.S. Department of Defense procurement contracts described plans for the 'upcoming nuclear mission' for the Lakenheath-based 48th Security Forces Squadron (SFS). U.S. Air Force Master Sgt. Danielle Heiser, 48th Security Forces Squadron operations section chief, gives remarks at a ribbon cutting ceremony for new security forces facilities at RAF Lakenheath, England, in February 2024. U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Olivia Gibson Senior Airman Olivia Gibson The reference to the 48th SFS resulted in The Telegraph newspaper in the United Kingdom publishing a story in January last year under the title 'U.S. to station nuclear weapons in U.K. to counter threat from Russia.' This same story also highlighted references in a Pentagon Statement of Work to 'imminent surety support' at Lakenheath. Once the story was published, this detail was removed from the same Statement of Work. The original version (annotated by FAS researchers) is provided below. Courtesy FAS Finally, as well as upgrades to facilities, Pentagon documents confirm that additional training is being given to nuclear weapons personnel at Lakenheath. Specifically, an Air Force Career Field and Education Training Plan (CFETP) for nuclear weapons specialists, updated in 2023, includes Lakenheath on a list of career assignment locations. The British air base had not previously been on that list. Considering the growing tensions between NATO and Russia in recent years, including Moscow’s forward deployment of nuclear weapons and fielding of longer-range missiles, the return of the nuclear mission to Lakenheath is not a surprise. The base, in the east of England, is home to the 48th Fighter Wing, which historically had a nuclear mission, although the last nuclear weapons were removed from the base in 2008. Today, the 48th Fighter Wing comprises the following squadrons: 492nd Fighter Squadron 'Bolars' flying the F-15E 493rd Fighter Squadron 'Grim Reapers' flying the F-35A 494th Fighter Squadron 'Panthers' flying the F-15E 495th Fighter Squadron 'Valkyries' flying the F-35A Both these aircraft types are capable of carrying B61 series freefall thermonuclear bombs and making full use of the capabilities of the latest B61-12 version, although it should be noted that this doesn’t extend to all NATO aircraft cleared to carry the weapon, as we have discussed in the past. An F-15E assigned to the 48th Fighter Wing, RAF Lakenheath, receives aerial refueling from a KC-135 Stratotanker aircraft assigned to the 100th Air Refueling Wing, RAF Mildenhall, over the North Sea in August 2023. U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Viviam Chiu In the past, NATO officials have repeatedly implied that nuclear weapons wouldn’t be returning to the United Kingdom. In 2021, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stated: 'We have no plans of stationing any nuclear weapons in any other countries than we already have these nuclear weapons as part of our deterrence.' 'There is no need to change where [nuclear weapons] are placed,' Jessica Cox, then-head of NATO nuclear policy, said in 2023. Courtesy FAS With this in mind, FAS concludes that the upgrade work at Lakenheath is being undertaken to make the base ready as a potential backup, 'rather than to deploy weapons now.' In this way, the Air Force could receive nuclear weapons from other bases in Europe or even from the United States in a time of crisis. This would, to a limited degree, increase the flexibility of the nuclear mission in Europe. Whether it would significantly reduce its vulnerability to potential Russian strikes is highly questionable since Lakenheath would already be high on the target list in such a scenario. On the other hand, the fact that NATO is even able to move nuclear weapons around more bases, more efficiently, is a signal of its nuclear readiness. IISS As for those other bases, as of early 2025, these are Kleine Brogel in Belgium, Büchel in Germany, Aviano and Ghedi in Italy, Volkel in the Netherlands, and Incirlik in Turkey. Of these, the Netherlands notably declared its F-35As fully responsible for the nuclear strike role as of June 2024. Regardless, FAS estimates that around 100 U.S.-owned B61-12 gravity bombs are available across these NATO air bases, with the United States having announced earlier this year that 'the B61-12 gravity bombs are fully forward deployed.' Having the B61-12 in Europe is a big deal in itself. Thanks to its precision-guidance system, which combines a new tail kit with an inertial navigation system package and rockets for spin stabilization, the B61-12 offers increased accuracy over older B61 versions. When combined with the F-35A, the B61-12 is increasingly being viewed as a strategic weapons-delivery system, as well as being a tactical strike asset. A U.S. Air Force F-35A drops an inert B61-12 during a test at Edwards Air Force Base, California. U.S. Air Force The FAS report also highlights the possibility that developments within NATO could also make a backup base at Lakenheath very useful. Namely, the security of nuclear weapons hosted in Turkey was raised after the 2016 coup attempt in that country. A possible evacuation of these weapons — which cannot actually be employed by Turkey, in contrast to other nuclear-sharing nations — was apparently considered again in 2019, when the United States and Turkey clashed over their respective policies in Syria. Then there is the possibility that Lakenheath might, in the future, become a permanent nuclear base alongside a potential drawdown of U.S.-owned nuclear weapons elsewhere in Europe, something that TWZ has also recently considered. An inert B61-12 gravity bomb attached to a U.S. Air Force F-15E. Sandia/Craig Fritz After all, with U.S. President Donald Trump having advocated for the possibility of slashing the U.S. nuclear inventory as part of a future arms deal with Russia, the NATO nuclear-sharing program might fall victim to cuts. Certainly, a reduction of the U.S. nuclear presence in Europe would have a significant cost-cutting benefit. In such a scenario, were the United States to discontinue one or more of its nuclear-sharing locations on mainland Europe, basing the weapons permanently at Lakenheath might become an attractive option to ensure there is still U.S.-provided European deterrence coverage, albeit at a lower level than now. For now, there is no evidence of U.S. nuclear weapons having been deployed to RAF Lakenheath. However, it now looks certain that the base is at last capable of accommodating them, should this be required now or in the future.

Boeing’s Little Bird Helicopter Production Set To End	Boeing expects to shutter its production of the Little Bird light helicopter after fulfilling a current contract with the Thai armed forces. The Little Bird is well known for its continued service with the U.S. Army's famed 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR), which operates the helicopter in AH-6 light attack and MH-6 assault configurations. Boeing has been able to secure just two export sales of its 'international' AH-6i variant to Saudi Arabia and Thailand in the past 15 years. A separate company, MD Helicopters also produces Little Bird variants and looks set to continue to do so. Multiple outlets have reported Boeing's plans to close out its Little Bird production line. The company disclosed the news at the DefenceIQ International Military Helicopter conference in London, which opened yesterday. An AH-6i destined for Thailand seen during flight testing. Boeing 'We are probably going to cease production on the AH-6i,' Mark Bellew, Boeing’s Director for Vertical-Lift Program Business Development and Strategy, told Aviation Week. 'We will complete production for Thailand, but right now, unless there is another country that came along immediately and said we want AH-6 today, it would still be a challenge as there would be a gap in production.' Bellew also 'suggested that rebuilding the supply chain for the aircraft would not only take time, but also make the aircraft more expensive to produce,' according to Aviation Week's report. TWZ has reached out to Boeing directly for more information. Boeing is currently working on delivering eight AH-6is to the Royal Thai Army under a contract finalized back in 2022 valued a just under $104 million. The U.S. government had approved that sale in 2019. The single turbine engine AH-6i is an evolution of the OH-6 Cayuse, originally developed by Hughes Helicopters in the 1960s and made famous by its service with the U.S. Army as a light scout helicopter during the Vietnam War, and subsequent H-6 variants based around the improved Model 500 design. McDonnell Douglas acquired Hughes Helicopters in 1984. Boeing subsequently absorbed McDonnell Douglas, to include the Little Bird and the rest of the former Hughes Helicopter product line, in 1997. A prototype YOH-6A seen during US Army testing in the 1960s. US Army The Little Bird's story has become somewhat confusing in that Boeing sold off virtually all of its inherited Hughes Helicopter product line, with the prominent exception of the AH-64 Apache, in 1999 to what has become MD Helicopters. However, Boeing continued to work with the Little Bird design after that, including upgraded Mission Enhanced Little Birds (MELB) for the 160th SOAR. One of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment's MH-6 Little Birds seen during a public demonstration in 2024. Jamie Hunter The company also developed an uncrewed H-6U version and an improved light attack variant dubbed the AH-6S. The AH-6S was pitched to the U.S. Army for its abortive Armed Aerial Scout (AAS) program. The export AH-6i is based on the AH-6S. As already noted, Boeing has found just two customers for the AH-6i, Thailand and Saudi Arabia, the latter of which ordered 24 examples for the Saudi Arabian National Guard (SANG) in 2014. Jordan signed a letter of intent to buy at least 18 AH-6is in 2010, but an expected contract never materialized. By comparison, MD Helicopters has enjoyed significant success in the international military market with Hughes Model 500-derived Little Birds, as well as sales of related commercial variants. This includes dozens of MD-530FU light attack variants delivered to the now-defunct Afghan Air Force, some of which made their way back to the United States after the Taliban takeover in August 2021. What level of involvement Boeing expects to continue to have in supporting the 160th SOAR's Little Bird fleet going forward is unclear. The Army had previously expected to replace around half of its AH-6/MH-6s with a special operations version of the design selected for the service's Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) program. However, FARA was canceled last year and the 160th is now looking, at least in the near term, at options for further upgrades to its Little Bird fleet, as you can read more about here. For Boeing, plans to shed the Little Bird production line also come amid significant turmoil across its military and commercial portfolios. This has translated to major delays on very-high-profile programs, including new Air Force One jets for the U.S. Air Force, and billions in financial losses. In 2023, the company had also announced its intention to shutter production of the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighter and refocus those resources elsewhere, again citing a lack of new customers. Unless a major new customer for the AH-6i emerges soon, Boeing's part of the Little Bird story looks set to come to end, though versions of the iconic helicopter will remain in production through MD Helicopters.

Ground-Launched And Powered Air-Launched Versions Of StormBreaker...	Raytheon has revealed that it’s working on a ground-launched version of its StormBreaker glide bomb, previously available only in air-launched form. The new development of the weapon should provide a very versatile follow-on to the Ground-Launched Small Diameter Bomb (GLSDB), which made its combat debut in Ukraine but had reportedly performed poorly there, especially due to heavy Russian jamming. Meanwhile, the same motor that will be used on the ground-launched model is also planned to be added to the air-launched version, providing a considerably greater standoff range. The existence of the ground-launched StormBreaker — the official name of the weapon was not revealed — was disclosed by Jon 'Stormin' Norman, the Vice President Air & Space Defense Systems Requirements & Capability at Raytheon. He was speaking on the Fighter Pilot Podcast, the full episode of which you can find here. A GBU-53/B StormBreaker loaded onto an F-15E Strike Eagle during a test. Raytheon 'On company funding, we’re working with some of the service labs to do a ground launch variant of [StormBreaker],' Norman said. 'We’ll be testing that to summer on company money, and that’ll give it a good range and a good point-defense capability.' Norman added that the company was still looking at propulsion options for the ground-launched version, with either a rocket motor or an air-breathing engine under consideration. However, whatever option is chosen will likely also make its way onto the air-launched version, too. 'We’re working on the engineering design to integrate that onto the weapon to greatly enhance the range of that StormBreaker so we can keep our pilots outside of threat rings. So we’re very excited about that. We think that this has a lot of growth capability.' An F-15E drops a StormBreaker during a test. Raytheon Before looking at the particular advantages offered by a ground-launched StormBreaker, it’s worth looking briefly at the development path that brought Raytheon here. The story starts with the 250-pound GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bomb or SDB I, a ‘fire and forget’ precision attack weapon that combines standoff with small size. This means more examples of the weapon can be carried by a single aircraft. Depending on the launch height and speed, the unpowered SDB I can reach targets as far as 60 miles away, thanks to its pop-out wing set. However, this is under optimal conditions, and a range in the region of 45-50 miles is more likely when launched from a tactical jet.

Lewis An A-10 carrying a load of 16 GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs (SDB) during testing. U.S. Air Force / William R. Lewis However, the original SDB I is not able to engage moving targets, a limitation addressed by the Small Diameter Bomb II, now better known as the GBU-53/B StormBreaker. This is able to hit moving targets in any weather, thanks to its tri-mode guidance system, which uses imaging infrared, millimeter-wave radar, or semi-active laser homing to hit a designated aimpoint. There is also a datalink, allowing the munition to communicate over the Link 16 network, so pilots can send updated target information to the StormBreaker after the weapon has left its launch pylon. While it only weighs 204 pounds, this includes a surprisingly powerful penetrating warhead for its size. The tri-mode seeker for the StormBreaker. Raytheon Depending on the altitude and speed of the launching aircraft, the weapon can glide up to 69 miles on its own using a GPS-assisted inertial navigation system, after which it can strike a specific coordinate or begin searching for a target. For moving targets, the weapon’s range is reduced to 45 miles. An F-35B about to be rearmed with inert AIM-120 AMRAAMs (left) and StormBreakers on a stretch of road next to the Pacific coastline in California. James Deboer A Marine F-35B sitting on a stretch of highway in California during a recent exercise. James Deboer The air-launched StormBreaker is therefore well suited to tasks as battlefield interdiction and destruction of enemy air defenses against ground-mobile targets and even anti-ship attacks. It’s also much more flexible when it comes to targeting and re-targeting overall. The first effort to transform the series into a surface-launched long-range precision strike weapon was the Ground-Launched Small Diameter Bomb, or GLSDB, developed by Boeing, in partnership with Saab of Sweden, on the basis of the air-launched SDB. Each GLSDB is comprised of two existing components, the air-launched GBU-39/B SDB and the rocket motor from the 227mm-caliber M26 artillery rocket. The M26 is among the rocket types that can be fired from the M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS), and variants thereof, and the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS). A rendering shows the launch of a GLSDB. Saab The GLSDB is propelled by its M26 rocket motor before the pop-out wings deploy for the final unpowered run-in to the target. Saab The GLSDB relies on the M26 rocket motor to propel it for the initial boost/loft phase, after which the wings are deployed and the munition flies unpowered, as a glide bomb. It uses the GBU-39/B’s existing inertial navigation system and embedded GPS to guide it to its target. The GLSDB has a range of around 94 miles. In its marketing literature, Saab claimed that the GLSDB’s guidance system not only ensures accuracy to within three feet but is also resilient to electronic warfare jamming, something that is of particular concern in the Ukrainian conflict. However, once exposed to combat for the first time by Ukrainian forces, it seems the GLSDB was found wanting. 'One company, I won’t say who they are, they came up with a really cool idea of taking an air-to-ground weapon and doing a ground-launched version of it, and it would be a long-range fire weapon,' Bill LaPlante, Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, said in April 2024. Although he didn’t mention the GLSDB by name, his meaning was clear, as no other weapons fit this description. 'They raced and did it as fast as they could,' LaPlante continued. He added that U.S. authorities relaxed their testing requirements to help speed the weapon system in question to Ukraine. 'We said, look, just test for safety. Otherwise, the operational testing will be non-cooperative with the Russians,' according to LaPlante. 'And so then we sent it to Ukrainians. It didn’t work.' A scale model of a GLSDB. Joseph Trevithick A scale model of a complete GLSDB round. Joseph Trevithick LaPlante claimed the GLSDB’s performance was limited for 'multiple reasons,' including the dense electronic warfare environment, as well as the tactics, techniques, and procedures. 'It just didn’t work,' LaPlante explained, before suggesting that the weapon had been more or less abandoned by the Ukrainians as a result. While LaPlante didn’t provide any more details on the electronic warfare issue, it’s by now no secret that Russian GPS jamming, in particular, has reduced the efficiency of Ukraine’s use of Western precision-guided ground and air-launched munitions. As the war in Ukraine has continued, Russian forces have significantly expanded their use of various kinds of electronic warfare capabilities. Clearly, weapons like GLSDB that rely on GPS are going to be especially vulnerable to Russian jamming of this kind. The StormBreaker, however, should be much more resilient, thanks to its tri-mode guidance. Although Norman made no mention of the GLSDB’s performance or of its utilization in Ukraine, having a weapon that is better able to cope with Russian or any other hostile electronic warfare makes a good deal of sense. A tri-mode seeker means that, unlike the GLSDB, the ground-launched StormBreaker will have the ability to find its way to a moving or static target and to cope with smoke, dust, and other poor weather conditions. Furthermore, the weapon’s onboard computer is able to classify and prioritize targets on its own, seeking out their especially vulnerable points, too. Additionally, the StormBreaker features hardening against electromagnetic jamming and cyber attacks, providing a further level of reliability. Aside from the propulsion choices, Norman didn’t provide details of how the ground-launched StormBreaker might work in comparison to the GLSDB. It’s unclear if the rocket motor he referred to would be the same as that used in the GLSDB, although the possibility of an air-breathing engine would tally with Raytheon’s goal of developing a weapon that will have a maximum range considerably greater than the roughly 94 miles of the GLSDB. This would be especially relevant for the air-launched version, in which the speed and altitude of the launch platform would combine with the motor to provide even greater standoff distance. The war in Ukraine has also reinforced the importance of having munitions that put considerably more distance between the launch platform and the target area. Even the GLSDB, for all its apparent problems, provides significantly greater reach than the longest-range 227mm artillery rockets currently available for the M270 MLRS and the M142 HIMARS. These can fire precision-guided rockets out to around 50 miles. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian Air Force has had notable success with the air-launched SDB. A weapon that combines the versatility of the air-launched StormBreaker with even greater standoff range would be of huge interest to any number of air forces. Clearly, depending on the eventual maximum range, a single ground-launched StormBreaker battery will be able to provide prompt precision strike option even against moving targets over a large geographical area. Just assuming the same range as the current GLSDB, it would be able to address targets over nearly 28,000 square miles. As such, it will offer even small forward-based unit unprecedented capabilities. This could including striking numerous vehicles dozens of miles away with exacting precision, in any weather, without the use of air support — whether it be manned or unmanned aircraft. This capability would offer drastic efficiencies and a new level of organic precision fire support basically anywhere on the battlefield a launcher can survive. When it comes to the powered air-launched SDB II, that would also offer a huge leap in capability, allowing aircraft to make greater use of ever more capable and farther-reaching kill webs that leverage advanced networking for targeting. Its extended range would also provide a larger margin of survivability for the launch platform, which face increasingly long-ranged air defenses. TWZ has approached Raytheon for more details about the ground-launched version of the StormBreaker — and the powered air-launched model. With tests of the ground-launched version apparently now underway, we should learn more about the new weapon in due course. While it’s hard to determine the full scope of its capabilities at this early stage, the ground-launched StormBreaker would appear to offer a range of advantages over the GLSDB, not least its ability to hit moving targets in all weathers — and its better resilience to electronic warfare jamming.

Axing Next Generation Fighter Would Leave Air Force Worse Off: Fo...	The U.S. Air Force's force design director says analyses to date show the service will face more operational risk and be less able to achieve assigned objectives without a new crewed sixth-generation combat jet. Air Force wargaming has shown a need to keep persistent pressure on the enemy in forward areas and that a force structure centered solely on long-range, stand-off capabilities does not win major fights. The service has yet to make a final decision on how to proceed, or not, with work on a new crewed sixth-generation combat jet as part of its Next Generation Air Domaince (NGAD) initiative, which will have broader ramifications for the entire force. Air Force Maj. Gen. Joseph Kunkel discussed the NGAD combat jet and related matters during a talk the Hudson Institute think tank in Washington, D.C., hosted earlier today. Kunkel is currently the Director of Force Design, Integration, and Wargaming within the office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Air Force Futures at the service's top headquarters at the Pentagon. A Lockheed Martin rendering of a crewed 6th generation stealth combat jet concept. Lockheed Martin 'So, the fight looks fundamentally different with [the] NGAD [combat jet] and without NGAD,' Kunkel said. 'I won't go into the details on how the fight looks different, but the fight looks much better when NGAD's in it.' 'So, I think at the end of the day, what we'll find is, you know, we'll make a decision on how the Joint Force wants to fight. If the Joint Force wants to fight with an NGAD, and [to gain] air superiority in these really, really tough places to achieve it, then we'll pursue NGAD and it'll be, frankly, it'll be less operational risk. The NGAD provides dominant capabilities,' he continued. 'If we choose not to, as a nation, to pursue NGAD, then that fight's just going to look a little bit different, all right, and we may not be able to pursue or achieve all of our policy objectives.' Details about competing NGAD combat jet designs that have been under development for years now are limited. The core requirements are understood to call relatively large, high-performance, and long-range design with a very high level of broadband low-observability (stealthiness) and an array of advanced sensors, networking, and other capabilities. The jets have also been expected to have a high unit price of around $300 million or more. Former Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall said in January that it would take approximately $20 billion, at least, just to complete the development of the aircraft. Series production of the aircraft would result in the complete cost of the program being much larger. Kendall had initiated a deep review of the NGAD combat jet plans last year. The Air Force considered several alternatives as part of that process, including a lower-cost design with more truncated capabilities and more focused on just acting as an aerial controller for Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones. The reassessment of NGAD also tied in with larger future force structure discussions, including about a possible shift in focus to longer-range, stand-off capabilities, such as those that the forthcoming B-21 Raider stealth bomber will provide. A rendering of a notional sixth-generation combat jet flying together with a trio of drones. Collins Aerospace 'There were some folks that were like, what if we just become an all-long-range force? And so we're like, okay, let's try it, let's see what [an] all-long-range force looks like,' Maj. Gen. Kunkel said at the Hudson Institute today. 'And turns out, an all-long-range force loses because what it can't do is it can't apply constant pressure to the adversary.' 'You've got to be forward in order to sustain the tempo that's required to bring the adversary to a sneeze. So an all-long-range force, &#8230; it sounds wonderful, doesn't it? You sit in Topeka, Kansas, you press a red button, the war gets fought. Nobody gets hurt. It's all done at long range,' Kunkel continued. '[But] it doesn't win because it just can't sustain the tempo of the fight.' 'Long-range fires are extremely important. They're absolutely game-changing. They're going to help us out,' he added. 'But they're probably not going to do it at the tempo that's required to keep the adversary, you know, on its knees all the time. You need something else. You need something inside. You need something inside that can generate tempo and mass.' Kunkel acknowledged that this need to be able to persist closer to the epicenter for a future fight raises its own challenges and questions, especially amid ever-growing air and surface-launched missile threats. The Air Force published a report detailing a vision for the service by 2050 last year, which underlined these issues, particularly in highlighting the expectation that anti-air missiles with a range of 1,000 miles will be part of that future threat ecosystem. For years now, the Air Force has already become increasingly concerned about the survivability of key supporting assets, especially aerial refueling tankers, even in what have been traditionally considered safer rear areas. A rendering of a notional sixth-generation combat jet refueling in flight. Lockheed Martin 'We are more focused on survivable air refueling,' Kunkel said. 'We're approaching this from the kill chain perspective.' He further elaborated that what this means is that the Air Force is looking a multiple tiers of what he referred to as 'attack surfaces' in the aerial refueling space that a potential adversary would have to address, which, in turn, would complicate their their kill chain planning cycles. The service has been looking to acquire new stealthy tankers as part of a larger Next-Generation Aerial Refueling System (NGAS) initiative, but has also been exploring other options like podded aerial refueling capabilities for fighter-sized aircraft. 'There are many attack surfaces that we can attack to bring survivable air refueling, right?' Kunkel noted. 'NGAS might be part of the solution, but there are other places along this kill chain that we can attack the adversary, and that's the approach we're taking.' A notional stealthy tanker depicted refueling a pair of F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. Lockheed Martin Skunk Works The Air Force is also looking at future air operations, especially in the context of a potential high-end fight in the Pacific against China, with the expectation of being under constant attack, or at least the threat thereof. This creates additional demands for forces trying to conduct higher-tempo operations in forward areas. 'The Air Force of the future is not going to be one that's operating from sanctuary, right? We are going to be contested everywhere, and frankly, we're contested everywhere right now,' Kunkel said. 'So this thought that we have to operate under the threat of attack is something that's going to be with us forever.' Kunkel emphasized the Air Force's current focus in this regard on more distributed and disaggregated concepts of operations, presently referred to collectively as Agile Combat Operations (ACE), that are designed to make friendly forces harder to target. Expanding the total number of operating locations available to Air Force units is a key element of ACE, as underscored by the massive effort in the past year or so to refurbish historic North Field on the U.S. island of Tinian in the western Pacific, which you can read more about here.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION New and improved supporting capabilities, all the way down to the most basic levels, as well as survivable supply chains, will also be needed to ensure that Air Force aircraft can operate effectively even from more far-flung locales, according to Kunkel. The requirements for sustaining historically maintenance-intentive stealthy aircraft, including skins and coatings that are highly sensitive to environmental factors, is a particular issue that needs to be addressed. 'When you think about the sustainment architectures that we built in the past, the thought was that they were going to be in sanctuary. So, you know, you could afford to build a piece of aircraft ground equipment that weighed 10,000 pounds and wouldn't fit on a C-130,' Kunkel explained. 'You can afford to have low-observable [steathly] restoration timelines on your aircraft that lasted multiple days and required climate-controlled facilities. Robotic systems apply a corrosion-resistant coating to a U.S. Air Force F-35A Joint Strike Fighter. USAF 'In a new environment where that whole thing is going to be under threat, we've got to think about it differently,' he continued. 'So we have been leveraging new technologies &#8230; in the field of low-observable maintenance, we made a significant amount of progress.' 'And I will tell you, some of it's not like the sexy, cool stuff. It's like the basics. It's like bomb loaders, missile loaders, and, you know, refueling trucks and, you know, electric carts and air conditioning carts. They've got to be made differently,' he added. Kunkel did appear to push back on calls for more physical hardening of facilities against enemy attacks, something that has become a heated topic of debate. The Hudson Institute think tank itself just published a report in January warning that U.S. airbases in the Pacific have been left worryingly vulnerable by a lack of investment in hardened and unhardened aircraft shelters. An F-16 Viper fighter sits inside a hardened aircraft shelter. USAF 'There's this thought that we need to invest in more defense. &#8230; And my counter that is no, we actually need to invest in more offense,' Kunkel said without explicitly mentioning physical hardening. 'We need to invest in more offense, and we need to make sure that those offensive capabilities inherently have survivability built into them.' As other Air Force officials have done in the past, Kunkel did advocate for more active air and missile defenses. A huge new air defense architecture taking shape on the critically strategic U.S. island of Guam in the western Pacific is a prime example of work already being done toward this end. Kunkel is also the latest Air Force official to raise the possibility of the service taking a more direct role in the air and missile defense realm. Since 1948, the U.S. Army has been the lead service in charge of defending Air Force bases at home and abroad against air and missile threats. There is the additional question now about whether budget priorities under President Donald Trump's new administration might upend various Air Force modernization plans, as well as ones across the rest of the U.S. military. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has directed a review of proposed Fiscal Year 2026 spending plans with an eye toward shifting roughly eight percent, or some $50 billion, of the Department of Defense's entire budget to new priorities, including a hugely expanded homeland missile defense architecture now dubbed Golden Dome. Air Force officials have already raised concerns about the affordability of the NGAD combat jet, as well as stealthy tankers and CCA drones, given the demands of even higher-priority programs. The ballooning costs of the Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) effort have been a key factor. There is also talk about increasing the size of the future B-21 bomber fleet. Secretary of Defense Hegseth has also ordered the Air Force to put a broad swath of modernization work on pause until a new Air Force Secretary is confirmed and can review the plans. The first pre-production B-21 Raider. USAF Speaking today, Kunkel was bullish on the Air Force's future budget prospects, but acknowledged that cuts to existing programs could have significant impacts. 'The role of the Air Force is increasing. It's not decreasing. It's increasing,' he said. 'For this future fight, we're going to be a big part of that. So no easy solutions in that space.' 'Our investments and our force design is [sic] completely in line with where the administration is going,' he added. 'When you look at the Secretary's priorities, and you look at our force design, there's a match.' Though questions remain about exactly what shape it take, the Air Force is clearly still pushing for the NGAD combat jet to be part of that future force structure.

This Is What The Classified AIM-260 Missile Actually Looks Like, ...	The U.S. Air Force has confirmed that a recently released rendering of the AIM-260A does indeed reflect the actual design of what is also known as the Joint Advanced Tactical Missile (JATM). The JATM, details about which are still highly classified, is expected to ultimately supplant the AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) in U.S. military service. The new AIM-260A rendering was included in an unclassified U.S. Navy industry day briefing that the service posted online earlier this month. The complete briefing provides an overview of projects that fall under the broad umbrella of Naval Air Systems Command's (NAVAIR) Program Executive Office for Unmanned Aviation & Strike Weapons (PEO U&W). JATM is more specifically within the purview of PEO U&W's Air-to-Air Missile Office, or PMA-259. The AIM-174B air-launched version of the Standard Missile-6 (SM-6), which was only formally unveiled last year, as well as the AIM-120, AIM-9 Sidewinder, and AIM-7/RIM-7 Sparrow missiles, are also in PMA-259's portfolio. The full slide from the PEO U&#038;W briefing that includes the AIM-260A rendering. USN As its name makes clear, JATM is also a joint program that the Air Force is directly involved in. When asked for more information about the AIM-260A rendering and for a more general update on the missile's development, NAVAIR redirected TWZ to the Air Force. 'This is a rendering of the AIM-260A,' an Air Force spokesperson subsequently told TWZ. 'A higher-resolution rendering is not available for public release.' 'Specific programmatic and technical details of the program are classified,' they added. 'JATM milestones and capabilities are classified.' In 2022, now-retired Air Force Gen. Mark Kelly, then head of Air Combat Command (ACC), also shared artwork of upgraded F-22 Raptors with new stealthy sensor pods and drop tanks seen below. One of the jets was depicted firing a then-unknown missile now definitively established to be a JATM. At least one other official AIM-260A rendering has emerged previously, which also aligns with the design seen in the PEO U&W briefing. Via USAF Gen. Mark Kelly This one has been around for a bit, from a Hook presentation a couple years ago. pic.twitter.com/CQx0qKnTuq&mdash; Brian Everstine (@beverstine) February 24, 2025 All three AIM-260A renders show the same core missile design optimized for high speed and low drag with just four fins at the tail end. For comparison, the existing AIM-120 has four tail fins and another four along the middle of its body. There are some minor detail differences between the AIM-260A renders that are now available, including the number and location of what appear to be conformal antennas along the front end of the missile's body. The latest depiction of the JATM from the PEO U&W briefing also has markings that point to a rocket motor that is substantially longer than the one found on the AMRAAM. Per U.S. military-standard munition markings, brown bands denote the presence of low-order explosives like solid-fuel rockets. On missiles, a pair of brown bands typically reflects where the rocket motor starts and ends within the body. Yellow bands mark the location of high-explosives used in warheads. Training missiles with inert rocket motors and/or warheads have blue bands instead. A side-by-side comparison of the AIM-260A render, at top, and a live AIM-120 missile, below. The distance between the brown bands on the AIM-260A represents a notably larger proportion of the missile's overall length compared to what is seen on the AIM-120. USN/USAF An advanced rocket motor with highly loaded propellant has long been seen as a likely route to give the AIM-260A significantly greater range, as well as speed, over the AIM-120 without making the new missile larger. A core known requirement for the JATM is that it has to have the same general form factor as the AMRAAM, in large part to ensure that it can fit inside the internal bays on stealth fighters like the F-22 and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. In addition to crewed aircraft, AIM-260As are expected to arm future stealthy drones like the ones under development under the Air Force's Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) program. 'The Next-Generation Highly Loaded Grain project team has matured the technology and seeded the development of future mission-modular propulsion systems that can increase weapon ranges by up to 1.5x while maintaining inner boundaries for short-range and time-critical missions,' according to a factsheet detailing notable achievements by NAVAIR's Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCAD) in 2023. PMA-259 has been similarly looking at highly loaded grain rocket motors as part of work toward a possible improved Block III version of the AIM-9X Sidewinder in recent years, as TWZ has explored in detail in the past. As part of the annual defense policy bill for the 2025 Fiscal Year, or National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which was passed and signed into law last year, Congress has demanded the Air Force and the Navy look into whether extended-range variants or derivatives of the AIM-9X and the AIM-120 could also help meet future air-to-air missile needs. 'The Next-Generation Highly Loaded Grain project team has matured the technology and seeded the development of future mission-modular propulsion systems that can increase weapon ranges by up to 1.5x while maintaining inner boundaries for short-range and time-critical… pic.twitter.com/gA7mlcSSi7&mdash; 笑脸男人 (@lfx160219) February 24, 2025 The AIM-260A's rocket motor is also likely to be a dual-pulse design that retains energy across the flight envelope to further extend range and help dramatically with endgame maneuverability. Thrust vectoring capability would also be a requisite to give the missile sufficient agility in the absence of additional control surfaces. If the renders of the AIM-260A prove fully accurate, the missile will also have a high-explosive warhead rather than be a hit-to-kill design intended to destroy its target through sheer force of impact. At the same time, if the AIM-260A's rocket motor is longer than that of the AIM-120, but the two missiles are roughly similar in size, this will reduce the space inside JATM for other components. This, in turn, could point to a smaller, but more advanced warhead designed to produce suitable destructive effects with less mass. A broadly similar rearrangement of internal space has also been observed on the AGM-88G Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile-Extended Range (AARGM-ER) compared to the preceding AGM-88E AARGM. A previously released briefing slide showing the internal configuration of the AGM-88G AARGM-ER and the considerable space inside devoted to its solid rocket motor. USN Details about the AIM-260A's capabilities otherwise remain limited. An active electronically scanned array radar (AESA) seeker is likely. Multi-mode seeker capability, potentially with imaging infrared and passive radiofrequency (RF) guidance capabilities, could be extremely valuable in the face of an ever-expanding countermeasure ecosystem, although we have no idea if this is a feature now or not. It's also possible it could be introduced in later variants. Advanced networking capabilities would be a key feature, allowing the missile to get additional targeting information from an array of third party sources. This is especially imported for engaging targets beyond the reach of the launch platform's own sensors and it can allow the aircraft firing the missile, especially a stealthy one, to avoid having to switch on its radar and increase its vulnerability to detection as a result. Multiple networked JATMs might even be able to prosecute engagements cooperatively. As TWZ has written in the past: 'The U.S. military has said explicitly in the past that concerns about increasingly longer-range Chinese air-to-air missiles have been a key driver behind work on the AIM-260. Even an extra 50 miles would give JATM a huge boost in capability over the AIM-120D. Better end-game energy state and multi-mode seeker would further boost its comparative abilities. As such, it would sit atop the AIM-120 as a long-range air-to-air weapon, with some significant overlap. Networking capabilities on all these weapons also give them the ability to leverage third-party targeting and all the guileful tactics that come with that feature set.' It's also it's unclear when the first JATMs might enter the U.S. military arsenal. When the program first emerged publicly in 2019, the goal was to begin fielding the missiles in 2022. However, there have been no indications publicly that this has occurred despite active testing of the missile, including live-fire shots, and other work to support its entry into service. No imagery of a real AIM-260A has emerged to date. What we do know for sure now is that the rendering in the recently released Navy briefing, as well as ones that have merged in the past, do show the AIM-260A JATM design.

South Korea’s Loyal Wingman Air Combat Drone Unveiled	South Korea today unveiled a new stealthy loyal wingman-type drone, the Low Observable Unmanned Wingman System, or LOWUS, which it plans to operate alongside the locally developed KF-21 Boramae next-generation fighter. The new drone is part of a growing fleet of low-observable drones being developed in South Korea as the country seeks to introduce new uncrewed technologies for a range of missions. The first prototype of the LOWUS was rolled out today at Korean Air’s Busan Tech Center in the southeast of the country. The drone was developed by Korean Air together with the Agency for Defense Development (ADD), a government body responsible for research and development in defense technology, funded by the Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA). Check out LOWUS design in the video below: The Agency for Defense Development (ADD) and Korean Air held a rollout ceremony on the 25th at the Korean Air Tech Center in Busan for the first prototype of the 'Low Observable Unmanned Wingman System (LOWUS),' a core platform of the manned-unmanned teaming system.The unmanned… pic.twitter.com/Y574HvlCW0&mdash; kf21_military (@fa50_defense) February 25, 2025 The LOWUS program was launched in 2021, with the research and development phase. A first flight of the first prototype is reportedly planned for the end of this year, leading toward the first manned-unmanned teaming flight tests by 2027. These will involve a piloted aircraft directly controlling the drone in flight. The new drone is being developed from the outset for manned-unmanned teaming, in which it will operate with a significant degree of autonomously alongside crewed combat aircraft. It is expected to undertake missions including reconnaissance, electronic warfare, and strike, in support of crewed fighters, including the KF-21. South Korea’s locally developed KF-21 Boramae next-generation fighter during its first air-to-air refueling trials. DAPA DAPA screencap In terms of its design, the LOWUS has stealth features, including a reduced radar cross-section and a construction that makes use of radar-absorbent material (RAM). Superficially, the drone looks very similar to the XQ-58A Valkyrie, the stealthy, affordable uncrewed aircraft that has been developed by U.S. drone-maker Kratos. The LOWUS also has some visual similarities with the Airpower Teaming System loyal wingman drone, now known as the MQ-28 Ghost Bat, which was developed by Boeing’s Australian subsidiary, initially for the Royal Australian Air Force. Previously, a drone design very similar to the LOWUS — if not identical — was presented by Korean Air in the form of an artist’s rendering, seen below. A rendering of what Korean Air pitched as a 'Stealth UAV Squadron' that includes a flying wing-type UCAV and multiple loyal wingman-type drones, with the closest one looking very much like the LOWUS. Korean Air Like the Valkyrie, the LOWUS features a stealthy trapezoidal fuselage, sharply swept main wings, a V-shaped tail, and an air intake located above the fuselage. Unlike the U.S. drone, the South Korean product features an electro-optical sensor in a turret below the nose. The powerplant of the LOWUS is not immediately obvious, although a domestically produced engine has been reported and the video released so far doesn’t reveal details of the internal weapons bay. There are also suggestions that the drone can be fitted with a locally developed active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar. For some time now, we’ve known that South Korea was working on manned-unmanned teaming system. In October 2021 it was announced that Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI), which is leading the KF-21 program, had won a $3.4-million contract from DAPA to rapidly develop technology of this kind, although it’s not immediately clear if this is related to the LOWUS program or a separate effort. However, the KAI initiative was apparently aimed, at least initially, to allow drones to support joint operations involving South Korean battlefield helicopters, such as the Surion and the Light Attack Helicopter (LAH). Previously, we had predicted that these same technologies could later be adapted for future integration of the KF-21 and drones, which may well be what’s happening now. Having a stealth drone available as a loyal wingman for the KF-21 would make a lot of sense, especially since the initial iteration of the fighters lacks the high-end stealth attributes of the F-35, for example, which is also operated by the ROKAF. The KF-21, at least in its initial form, will carry all its disposable armament externally and not in internal weapons bays.

Photo by South Korean Defense Ministry via Getty Images Furthermore, the KF-21 will initially be fielded in the air-to-air-only Block 1 variant, making a drone like the LOWUS, capable of carrying air-to-ground munitions, much more useful as an adjunct to the crewed fighter. This would allow the drone to prosecute ground targets that have been identified by the KF-21, for example. Only with the subsequent Block 2 version will the KF-21 gain an air-to-ground capability. As TWZ wrote in the past: 'More generally, a stealth unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV)carrying internal weapons would be an enormous advantage to the KF-21 Block 1 or Block 2 when penetrating heavily contested airspace. This would allow the manned fighter to remain at a safer standoff distance and use its highly capable Meteor missiles and AESA radar and infrared search and track (IRST) to pick off aerial targets. This could be done perhaps by targeting data received from the UCAV’s own sensors without the need to use the KF-21’s onboard radar at all. This concept is increasingly attractive as it could allow manned fighters to remain largely electromagnetically silent, increasing their survivability, with the drone taking on the higher-risk role as a forward sensing platform.' South Korea is developing the KF-21 to replace the Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF) now-retired F-4E Phantom II and still-active F-5E/F Tiger II fighters. Currently, it’s planned for the ROKAF to introduce 40 KF-21s by 2028 and have a full fleet of 120 aircraft deployed by 2032. For the manned-unmanned teaming component of the KF-21’s operations, it’s likely that the ROKAF will make specific use of the two-seat variant. With accommodation for an additional crewmember, this would make it ideal for the ‘loyal wingman’ drone-controller mission, reflecting the same approach pursued by China, where a two-seat J-20 stealth fighter apparently intended for this mission has been developed. A two-seat KF-21 fighter, the sixth prototype, on display during the Seoul International Aerospace and Defense Exhibition (ADEX) in Seongnam, South Korea, on October 17, 2023. Photo by Zhang Hui/VCG via Getty Images Of course, the LOWUS could also find practical applications beyond the KF-21, including in support of the FA-50 light combat aircraft, providing it these relatively cheap fighters with a much higher degree of survivability. Although based on an advanced jet trainer, the FA-50 is a potent combat platform in its own right, with a multimode radar and precision-guided weapons, including the AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missile and GBU-38/B Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM). It also has twin seats, making it suitable for a drone-controller role. A ROKAF FA-50 light combat aircraft. KAI ROKAF The FA-50 has already found export success and the option of offering for sale with a complementary loyal wingman drone could make it even more attractive, provided that Seoul releases these technologies for sale to foreign customers. Even without the FA-50, or the KF-21, for that matter, the LOWUS could be a compelling export prospect. South Korea is an increasingly major player on the global arms market and a loyal wingman that could be integrated with a range of other combat aircraft would be a unique selling point. As regards Seoul’s stealthy drone programs, we know of previous efforts, most of which have focused on tailless flying-wing designs. For some years now, Korean Air has been working on a stealthy UCAV under the KUS-FC program. A subscale demonstrator, the Kaori-X, began flight testing in 2015. This demonstrator has reportedly been used to test low observability, aerodynamic control and stability, and propulsion concepts. The stealthy, tailless Kaori-X demonstrator developed by Korean Air was unveiled in August 2020. Korean Air In September 2021, the ADD announced that it had mastered critical technologies to allow the production of full-size stealthy UCAVs, the result of a project launched in 2016. In particular, the agency pointed to the development of aerial structures, including RAM, plus flight control algorithms that would help reduce a drone’s radar cross-section. The ADD also described these features being incorporated in a tailless unmanned aerial vehicle. Reports suggest that this effort was separate from but complementary to the KUS-FC program. Concept art from Korean Air showing a possible configuration of the KUS-FC stealthy UCAV. Korean Air Meanwhile, in September 2023, another — much smaller — stealthy-shaped flying wing drone appeared in a military parade in Seoul. Five of these uncrewed aircraft were included in the procession, each mounted on top of a 4×4 light utility vehicle, although the drones’ tricycle landing gear indicates they are intended to take off and land from traditional runways. Although broadly similar in layout to the Kaori-X, the new drones features a ‘cranked kite’ wing configuration, similar to what is seen on the X-47B. South Korean flying wing drones on top of Kia Light Tactical Vehicles (KLTV) on parade in Seoul in September 2023. ANTHONY WALLACE/AFP via Getty Images Overall, drones are very much an area of interest for the South Korean military, which announced the creation of a dedicated drone operations command in September 2023. 'The command will mainly utilize the unmanned assets to carry out defensive and offensive operations and deter various asymmetric threats posed by the enemy, including drones, nuclear weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction during a contingency,' South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) explained at the time, according to a report from South Korean media outlet Yonhap. 'It is also tasked with conducting surveillance, reconnaissance, and strike operations, as well as psychological warfare and electromagnetic warfare at a strategic and operational level.' A DAPA video shows a heavily armed KF-21 (complete with an external targeting pod) flying a mission with three stealthy drones. DAPA screencap Already, the KF-21 is gaining much interest on account of its rapid development timeline and its innovative approach to fielding a new-generation fighter, with certain design compromises having been taken to ease its path into service. With today’s rollout of the Low Observable Unmanned Wingman System drone, another part of the KF-21’s intriguing concept of operations has emerged.

Trump’s Missile Defense Initiative’s Name Changed From Iron Dome ...	From now on, President Donald Trump’s effort to create a hugely expanded missile defense system will be called Golden Dome. 'Please note the Department of Defense has renamed this program from ‘Iron Dome for America’ to ‘Golden Dome for America,' the U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA) wrote in a recent request seeking input from industry on how it could contribute to this effort. This follows what seemed to be an off-hand comment Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth made on Feb. 20. In a video explaining the Pentagon’s budget realignment plans, he listed 'the Golden Dome, or Iron Dome,' as among defense programs that will be protected from any cuts. The MDA RFI seems to have codified that. The new name is starting to gain traction. During his confirmation hearing for the position of deputy defense secretary earlier today, Stephen Feinberg was asked by U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds (R-SD) if he supported the creation of the 'Iron Dome missile defense shield for America, I think some people called it the Golden Dome&#8230;' Feinberg answered in the affirmative. 'If confirmed will you protect the Dept of Defense’s spectrum so that @POTUS Iron Dome (Golden Dome) for America can be built and function optimally?'Feinberg: YES! pic.twitter.com/7zhRZWdax4&mdash; DOD Rapid Response (@DODResponse) February 25, 2025 It is unknown exactly what circumstances prompted the name to be changed. It is clearly a way to distinguish the plan from the wholly unrelated Israeli Iron Dome system. Made by Raytheon and Israel’s Rafael, as seen in the video below, Israel’s Iron Dome is designed primarily to defend against lower-end and localized threats like artillery rockets and mortar shells. It also now has some capability against drones and cruise missiles. The choice of the new name was likely made to invoke Trump’s famously favorite color, gold. We reached out to the Pentagon and the MDA for more details about when the change was made and why. The MDA referred us to the White House, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment. We will update this story with any pertinent details provided. As we have previously reported, one of Trump’s first official acts of his second term was to order the U.S. military to move forward with plans for a massively enlarged missile defense architecture. Dubbed, at the time, Iron Dome, it notably included a call for new space-based anti-missile interceptors. The concept was something Trump talked about on the campaign trail and made official in a Jan. 27 executive order. You can read more about what we knew about the plan before Trump signed it into law in our detailed story here. From our story about the executive order: It calls for a 'next-generation missile defense shield' that 'shall include, at a minimum, plans for' the following eight components: Defense of the United States against ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks from peer, near-peer, and rogue adversaries Acceleration of the deployment of the Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor layer Development and deployment of proliferated space-based interceptors capable of boost-phase intercept Deployment of underlayer and terminal-phase intercept capabilities postured to defeat a countervalue attack Development and deployment of a custody layer of the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture Development and deployment of capabilities to defeat missile attacks prior to launch and in the boost phase Development and deployment of a secure supply chain for all components with next-generation security and resilience features Development and deployment of non-kinetic capabilities to augment the kinetic defeat of ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks' A graphic showing, in a very rudimentary way, the difference in trajectories between a traditional ballistic missile and a hypersonic boost-glide vehicle. GAO MDA is seeking industry feedback on 'innovative acquisition methods or contract vehicles' that could be used to speed up the procurement process of making Golden Dome a reality. The agency wants industry to point out changes needed to 'reduce timelines and avoid delays' and 'obstacles in regulations or policies that impede going ‘fast’ and recommended mitigations.' More specifically, MDA is seeking 'innovative missile defense system technologies, architectures, and concepts to demonstrate and field rapid hypersonic defense capabilities applicable to both regional and homeland defense.' Those capabilities should include, but are not limited to 'near-term, innovative, and disruptive hypersonic defense capabilities across the missile defense kill chain (Left of Launch through Missile Defeat) including sensors and effectors.' The deadline for submitting ideas is Friday. So for a few more days, MDA will revert to the initiative's previous name. 'Since the RFI will close in less than a week, our drop boxes and other related items will remain as ‘Iron Dome for America,’' MDA stated.

China’s Massive WZ-9 Divine Eagle Drone Now Operating From South ...	China's large, jet-powered, twin-fuselage WZ-9 Divine Eagle drone has been operating at least sporadically out of an airbase on the highly-strategic Hainan Island at the northern end of the hotly contested South China Sea since at least December 4th. This is a new indication that this highly important aircraft is now at least in a semi-operational state. The WZ-9 is a high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) uncrewed 'sensor truck' that carries multiple radars capable of spotting and tracking targets over vast areas. These include objects in the air and on the surface below, as well as producing high-quality map-like radar images. While the operational status of the Divine Eagle is unclear, operations from Hainan would make perfect sense for providing valuable broad-area early warning and surveillance coverage out into the South China Sea and potentially far beyond. A satellite image TWZ obtained from Planet Labs, seen below, shows the WZ-9 drone at Ledong Air Base, also known as Foluo Northeast Air Base, on December 4, 2024. Ledong/Folou is a People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) facility situated at Hainan's southwestern end. Hainan is an absolutely critical location for the People's Liberation Army that hosts multiple bases, including two sprawling naval facilities, one of which supports the country's second strike nuclear deterrent and features a submarine cave complex. PHOTO © 2025 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION A satellite image offering a general look at Ledong Air Base. Google Earth Two additional drones are seen in the image, one of which is a WZ-7 Soaring Dragon with its own highly distinctive joined-wing design. WZ-7s have been operating from Ledong/Folou since at least 2022. What the other uncrewed aircraft, which has a v-shaped tail, might be is not as immediately obvious, but it could be a member of the popular Wing Loong family. There were also reports that jet-powered WZ-10s, which have v-tails, were flying from the base last year, although the aircraft in the image does not match that more advanced type. Additional satellite images, seen at the top of this story and below, from Maxar Technologies, show the Divine Eagle drone still at Ledong/Folou as of just yesterday. A WZ-7 is again seen alongside the WZ-9 in this satellite image of Ledong/Folou taken on February 24, 2025. Satellite image ©2025 Maxar Technologies Satellite image ©2025 Maxar Technologies Details about the WZ-9, the development of which reportedly traces back at least to the early 2010s, remain limited and it's unknown how many examples may currently exist. Imagery of the exotic-looking Divine Eagle that has emerged to date, along with renderings and models, show it has a very long high-aspect-ratio wing at the rear, as well as a smaller wing structure between the front ends of the two fuselages serving as a forward stabilizer. The drone is powered by a single jet engine mounted in a nacelle pod on top of the main wing between its two vertical tails. Chinese interest The span of the WZ-9's main wing is around 147 feet (45 meters), but its overall length is just shy of 50 feet (15 meters). For comparison, the U.S. RQ-4 Global Hawk HALE drone has a wingspan of just under 131 feet (nearly 40 meters) and is almost 48 feet (14.5 meters) long. At least one model has previously emerged indicating that the WZ-9 has at least two large side-looking radars (SLARs), one in each fuselage facing outward. These radars may have ground moving-target indicator and air moving-target indicator (GMTI/AMTI) capabilities, as well as the ability to produce synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery.

TWZ has noted in the past that the design looks intended to fill a need for a higher-end HALE design as higher-performing counterpart to the WZ-7 that is designed around the ability to carry two large radar arrays. Advanced passive radio frequency detection capabilities are also likely to be present on the WZ-9. Reports about the Divine Eagle's have also long pointed to the airborne early warning role in addition to the ability to perform other intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions, whereas the WZ-7 has been more focused on general ISR. The PLAAF and the PLAN have already fielded an impressive array of increasingly capable crewed airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft, the majority of which are turboprop-powered designs, as you can read more about in this past TWZ feature. The PLA continues to make significant investments in this area. A new AEW&C aircraft based on the Y-20 four-engine jet-powered cargo plane, offering advantages in terms of speed, range, on-station time, and altitude over turboprop types, is now in development. A turboprop-powered KJ-500A, one of China's most modern airborne early warning and control aircraft in service currently. This particular example has an aerial refueling probe. Chinese Internet The HALE WZ-9 would fit in well with this existing AEW&C ecosystem. Altitude is especially important for the airborne early warning mission, particularly when it comes ‘look down’ capability to find low-flying aircraft and missiles that radars down below might not be able to ‘see’ because of terrain and other factors. A higher perch also offers a much better line of sight, which can increase the area a single platform can surveil. As already noted, the current operational status of the WZ-9 is not clear, but the presence of a Divine Eagle in Hainan for months now could point to the drone being at a very mature phase of testing or even semi-operational, if not fully operational. Basing the drone at Ledong/Folou makes good sense from an operational perspective, too. From there, Divine Eagles could monitor broad swaths of the South China Sea. China claims the bulk of this body of water as its national territory, something that is not recognized by the vast majority of the international community. The PLA has been working for years now to expand its anti-access and area denial capabilities (A2/AD) in the region to help assert its claims. This includes a number of man-made islands with airstrips that also host anti-ship and surface-to-air missile batteries. A map showing estimated ranges and endurances for various Chinese crewed and uncrewed ISR platforms when operating from man-made outposts in the South China Sea giving a sense of existing coverage capacity. Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory As part of the PLA's A2/AD strategy in the South China Sea, WZ-9s could fly more persistent orbits for long periods, covering broader areas than their manned counterparts. In this capacity, the WZ-9 would also be able to act as a highly valuable source of situational awareness and targeting data. This includes providing key data for air, ground, and ship-launched missiles. The Divine Eagle is large enough that it might be able to take on additional roles, including as a communications signal relay, in the future. WZ-9 flying from Hainan could also conduct similar missions to the north around Taiwan, but they could be an even more powerful force multiplier further out into the Pacific. Divine Eagles could stage from other bases across China to provide coverage of this vast and desolate space, working as a critical component of complex kill chains stationed at the forward edge. Data from its radars could provide critical real-time targeting updates for long-range weapons and detect enemy aerial and surface movements from extreme standoff ranges. The aircraft could also play a role in areas at the center of other territorial disputes, as well as overland, especially along the country's contested borders with India, although just how optimized its radar and software is to the maritime environment isn't known. All of this follows the PLA's increasing use of drones overall to conduct more persistent surveillance of areas of high strategic interest, as well as China's general pursuit of ever-more capable uncrewed aircraft, in recent years. The WZ-9, which has now emerged in the highly strategic South China Sea, is well in line with those trends.

France Eyeing Deployment Of Nuclear-Armed Rafale Fighters To Germ...	France is apparently looking at the possibility of deploying air-launched nuclear weapons to Germany, a consideration that’s being made amid growing concerns that the United States will no longer guarantee European security under NATO. Broader discussions about nuclear deterrence among European leaders point very clearly to the deepening crisis in the transatlantic alliance under U.S. President Donald Trump, emphasized by calls from German leader-in-waiting Friedrich Merz for talks with his British and French colleagues about European 'nuclear sharing or at least nuclear security.' According to a report in the British newspaper The Telegraph, which cites an unnamed French official, 'Posting a few French nuclear jet fighters in Germany should not be difficult and would send a strong message' to Russia, which would aim to bolster Europe’s nuclear deterrent.

Photo by Thomas Lohnes/Getty Images Thomas Lohnes While it’s unclear how seriously the proposal is being discussed at the highest levels in France, there is a logic behind raising the idea at this point in public. In France, there is now an increasing focus on building up Europe’s capacity to provide a defensive bulwark against Russia, as Trump shifts to embrace Moscow. The result has been a growing rift between the United States and its European NATO allies, with differing positions on the continued provision of support for Ukraine looming large. Evidence of this fractious relationship was provided in a meeting between Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron in Washington yesterday, in which Ukraine was again atop the agenda. Trump refused to provide security guarantees to Ukraine once a potential peace deal is signed. French President Emmanuel Macron meets with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office at the White House on February 24, 2025, in Washington, DC. Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images The Washington Post Macron warned Trump against a 'surrender' of Ukraine, while the U.S. president claimed that Putin 'wants to make a deal' that might include European peacekeepers. The talks took place just hours after the United States voted against a United Nations resolution drafted by Ukraine and the European Union condemning Russia for its invasion. Macron interrupted Trump and corrected him on how much Europe spends on defense and he also called on Europe to do more collectively to protect the continent. Now, it seems, stationing French nuclear weapons in Germany is being assessed as one way of extending Europe’s deterrence, in the potential absence of U.S. security guarantees. Before his meeting with Trump, Macron had talks with Merz, who is expected to be the next German chancellor after winning elections in the country last weekend. Friedrich Merz, set to be the next German chancellor, stands in front of a German Luftwaffe Eurofighter EF2000 at Rostock-Laage Air Base in June 2024. Photo by Michael Kappeler/picture alliance via Getty Images picture alliance For his part, Merz has also been promoting the idea of increased European independence from U.S. security guarantees, including extended nuclear protection from France and the United Kingdom — the only two NATO countries in Europe with sovereign nuclear deterrence capabilities. 'We need to have discussions with both the British and the French — the two European nuclear powers — about whether nuclear sharing or at least nuclear security from the United Kingdom and France, could also apply to us,' Merz said last week. He then went on to warn that the United States was now 'indifferent to the fate of Europe.' This statement came after U.S. Vice President JD Vance had suggested that American troops might be pulled out of bases in Germany, where they have been ever-present since the end of World War II. The Telegraph story cites German diplomats as suggesting that the French proposal to station their nuclear weapons in Germany could prompt the United Kingdom to do the same. Currently, however, the United Kingdom relies exclusively on a submarine-based nuclear deterrent, based around Trident 2 D5 missiles. A U.K. Royal Navy Vanguard class submarine, which currently provides the U.K.’s Continuous at Sea Deterrent. Each of the four boats is armed with Trident 2 D5 nuclear missiles. Crown Copyright PO(PHOT) IAN ARTHUR France, meanwhile, has both submarine-launched ballistic missiles and air-launched nuclear missiles of its own design. More importantly, these weapons are technically independent of NATO nuclear planning, unlike the British nuclear deterrent, which is also closely intertwined with that of the United States. How this would all play out when confronted by the realities of a nuclear conflict involving NATO is unclear, but it does at least provide Paris with more flexibility when it comes to discussions of how its nuclear umbrella might be extended to European NATO allies. The suggestion of 'a few French nuclear jet fighters in Germany' would involve French Air and Space Force Dassault Rafale multirole righters, armed with ASMP-A standoff missiles. These are part of France’s Forces Aériennes Stratégiques (FAS, Strategic Air Forces), which were established back in 1964. In fact, during the 1960s, France had F-100D/F Super Sabre jet fighters stationed at two bases in West Germany, armed with U.S.-supplied tactical nuclear bombs. A French Air Force F-100D at Toul-Rosières Air Base France in June 1970. French Air Force However, the ASMP-A is a sovereign capability and not part of the ‘dual-key’ arrangement that still provides U.S.-supplied B61 nuclear bombs for use by NATO air arms in Europe. Currently, the French Air and Space Force’s nuclear assets are based around roughly 50 two-seat Rafale Bs, which are located at Saint Dizier-Robinson Air Base and are supported by a fleet of Airbus A330 MRTT Phénix aerial refueling tankers. As well as two air force squadrons with nuclear-tasked Rafale Bs, the French Navy also operates navalized Rafale Ms from the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle, which can also be armed with ASMP-A. A French Air and Space Force pilot boards a Rafale at Saint-Dizier Air Base in March 2021. Photo by FRANCOIS NASCIMBENI/AFP via Getty Images FRANCOIS NASCIMBENI As for the missile itself, this is a medium-range supersonic standoff cruise missile equipped with a thermonuclear warhead of around 300 kilotons. Its liquid-fuel ramjet engine powers it at speeds of Mach 3 over a maximum range of around 500 kilometers (310 miles), depending on the flight profile. In 2015, the then-president of France, François Hollande, confirmed that France had 54 operational ASMP-A missiles. Clearly, a detachment of aircraft and missiles at an air base in Germany would be a significant burden on France’s hard-worked Rafale fleet, although it would not be impossible. At the same time, France is also preparing to add to its Rafale fleet, as part of increasing investment in its armed forces across the board. Last weekend, France’s Minister of the Armed Forces, Sébastien Lecornu, took to social media platform X, calling for Europe to 'accelerate our rearmament,' and outlining plans for France to buy up to 30 additional Rafales, three more frigates, more drones, and electronic warfare platforms. It’s unclear if the French proposal is intended to supplement the U.S.-supplied weapons on German soil, but it seems more likely it’s envisaged as an emergency measure should the United States remove or scale back its critical role in the NATO nuclear-sharing arrangement. Under this, U.S.-owned B61 bombs are also housed in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Turkey, and can be employed by tactical jet aircraft from approved member states. Turkey notably hosts B61s but is not among the countries that could employ them.

Public Domain/Wikimedia Commons At present, Germany has around 20 U.S.-owned B61 nuclear bombs at Büchel Air Base, where they are provided for the German Luftwaffe’s Tornado swing-wing strike aircraft. This base is midway through an upgrade that is adding, among others, a service area for Germany’s future nuclear-capable F-35As and a refurbished runway. Those stealth fighters were acquired by Germany primarily on the basis of them being able to continue the nuclear mission, armed with the latest B61-12 version of the bomb.

Photo by Thomas Frey/picture alliance via Getty Images picture alliance Notably, Trump has regularly spoken about the possibility of slashing the U.S. nuclear inventory as part of a future arms deal. With that in mind, a dialing back or even an ending of the nuclear-sharing program could also emerge as a significant cost-cutting measure. At the same time, it’s conceivable that such a move could be made in parallel with the likely return of B61s to the United Kingdom, which may be an attractive move to ensure there is still U.S.-provided European deterrence coverage, albeit at a lower level than now. Whatever comes of the latest proposal, it’s the latest example of Europe’s leading NATO nations taking another look at how nuclear deterrence works on the continent and whether it should be expanded, independent of the United States. The idea of some kind of European nuclear deterrent has also been raised in the past by France. In fact, as long ago as 2007, France proposed talks with Germany on sharing its nuclear arsenal, although Berlin was unmoved. The theme was raised again in 2020, by Macron, who suggested a 'Europeanized' French nuclear deterrence. French President Emmanuel Macron, followed by French Minister of the Armed Forces, Sébastien Lecornu (second right), walks past a Rafale fighter at Mont-de-Marsan Air Base, southwestern France, in January 2023. Photo by BOB EDME/POOL/AFP via Getty Images BOB EDME More recently, Macron has called for further discussions on the topic, likely to involve Germany and the United Kingdom, and, for the first time, such proposals seem to be gaining traction with European allies. A 'Europeanized' nuclear deterrence scenario, in the short term at least, would be reliant on French air-launched nuclear weapons, which are the only examples of their kind in NATO not owned by the United States and which offer the flexibility to be deployed at air bases across Europe — provided the local infrastructure has been upgraded to support and securely store them. An unnamed German diplomat told The Telegraph that they considered that Merz and his CDU party — now the strongest single force in German politics — believe that 'a nuclear umbrella' is needed for Europe, outside of the ‘dual-key’ arrangement with the United States. 'We want to have a say in this, we should be ready to talk about this, and we are willing to pay for it,' the same diplomat added. TWZ spoke to Hans Kristensen, the director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists for their thoughts on the French proposal, which he said was 'understandable … given what’s happening in the United States.' But he also noted that there were more than a few questions about the plan and its utility. 'France and the United Kingdom are already nuclear members of NATO, and although the French arsenal is officially independent, it’s an illusion to imagine France staying outside a European conflict that rises to the level of nuclear weapons,' Kristensen remarked. 'France has less than 50 air-based missiles and ‘offering’ deployment in Germany would immediately raise issues about the much wider nuclear posture in Europe,' he continued, before noting the difference between France’s ‘strategic’ ASMP-A and the ‘dual-key’ B61s held by the United States in Europe that are classified as ‘tactical’ weapons. An unarmed ASMP test round is launched from a Mirage IVP in 1987. The Mirage IVP was the first platform to carry the ASMP series nuclear missile. Photo by Jean GUICHARD/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images Jean GUICHARD 'Would this mean that France’s air-delivered nukes are tactical after all? What would that mean for French nuclear policy that insists its nukes are not tactical? What about the other allies; why don’t they get deployment? How capable would a French bomber umbrella actually be given Russia’s much larger nuclear arsenal? Why would this have any additional reassuring impact on reassuring Germany/Europe than the current posture has? Why would it have any positive impact on Russia?' 'It’s so easy to throw up symbolic chest-thumping initiatives these days, but supporters have to be careful about creating hollow postures with commitment traps,' Kristensen observed. 'If Europe wants to help deterrence and reassurance, it should focus on conventional capabilities that it can actually use and let nukes stay in the background where they belong.' TWZ also spoke to Dmitry Stefanovich, a research fellow at the Center for International Security, IMEMO RAS, who provided his assessment of the latest French proposal. 'Clearly, France seems to be the natural provider of such a nuclear umbrella, and actually to some extent, it is already the case, judging by the language used by Macron labeling European security a French vital interest. However, I have doubts that the materialization of this umbrella can take the form of the actual deployment of nuclear weapons in Germany or elsewhere. Some sort of ‘European conventional support to nuclear operations’ seems more realistic, i.e. conventional jets, tankers, or airborne early warning and control aircraft joining the French Poker [nuclear readiness] exercise or something like that. Moreover, French Rafales from ‘nuclear’ units already participate in Baltic Air Policing missions, and something like that in practice, but labeled with ‘nuclear flavor’ and including deployment and joint flights in other European countries is also possible.' Stefanovich also noted how the actual deployment of nuclear weapons could be promoted as a substitute in case the United States does finally decide to pull its nuclear weapons out of Europe, in which case the United Kingdom would be the likely exception. 'I find this scenario very unlikely,' Stefanovich added. 'But still, it might be a step towards achieving a more stable security architecture in the region, including Russia. And French forward-deployed nukes might be traded for some Russian forward deployments.' Ultimately, it might not even take these questions to derail any plans for a deployment of French nuclear weapons in Germany, since such a move would only really be likely were the United States to pull its nuclear weapons out of Germany — and potentially out of other NATO countries too. At this point, that doesn’t look to be on the agenda, but it’s nonetheless highly significant that European NATO leaders are at least starting to imagine a future security environment where this could happen.

Third Anniversary Of Ukraine War Markedly Different Than Previous...	Last February, when Ukraine marked the second anniversary of the full-on invasion by Russia, the geopolitical chess pieces were in vastly different positions than they are today, the third anniversary of the war. The U.S., Ukraine’s staunch benefactor, has made a stunning course correction under President Donald Trump. The new administration has opened up direct negotiations with Russia without Ukraine at the table and has put into question America's commitment to NATO. A deal to obtain rights to Ukraine’s mineral reserves that Trump says will recoup America's investment in the war effort has also spurred a backlash in Kyiv. Perhaps nothing is more illustrative of this change than the U.S. siding with Russia, North Korea, Iran and 14 other Moscow allies Monday against a resolution condemning Russian aggression in Ukraine and calling for the return of Ukrainian territory. #BREAKINGUN General Assembly ADOPTS resolution 'Advancing a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine'; calls for deescalation, early cessation of hostilities and peaceful resolution of the war against UkraineRESULTIn favor: 93Against: 18Abstain: 65 pic.twitter.com/VhQ5Y1W2il&mdash; UN News (@UN_News_Centre) February 24, 2025 Meanwhile, Ukraine is feeling the effects of the slow provision of arms by the Biden administration. It is on its heels across a 600-mile front line in a grinding, bloody fight that is resulting in the slow loss of territory in critical areas. Any gains by either side have come at a tremendous cost to both sides. Ukraine’s salient in Russia’s Kursk region has been greatly reduced since its peak last fall. Overall, the Ukrainian armed forces are facing a glaring manpower deficit, which puts into question its ability to sustain the status quo. One reason for Trump’s embrace of Putin is his desire to drive a wedge between Moscow and Beijing, The Wall Street Journal recently suggested. A briefing memo obtained by the Journal 'suggested that Moscow propose ending cooperation with China on sensitive technological and military issues as part of a deal to end the war in Ukraine on terms favorable to Russia.' Moscow 'could also offer to limit Chinese participation in infrastructure projects that would strengthen China’s strategic capabilities,' the memo said. 'It also suggested a pledge by Russia to limit the resumption of natural gas exports to Europe to undermine European competitiveness and to allow sales of American liquefied natural gas, as well as offers to grant U.S. companies rights to mineral deposits in occupied Ukraine.' However, prying Moscow and Beijing apart would be difficult at best. With a 'no-limits' friendship agreement, the two have deep military and intelligence ties and China has provided computer chips and machine tools the Russian military has relied on.

'For me, the absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA' in defense matters,' Friedrich Merz said. Leader of the center-right CDU/CSU alliance, Merz said he had 'no illusions at all about what is coming out of America.' 'After Donald Trump's statements in the last week, it is clear that the Americans are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe,' he said on German television following national elections. 'I'm very curious to see how we head toward the NATO summit at the end of June — whether we will still be talking about NATO in its current form or whether we will have to establish an independent European defense capability much more quickly,' Merz added. Germany has contributed the second most military aid to Ukraine, trailing only the U.S., according to the Kiel Institute For The World Economy’s Ukraine Support Tracker. Merz’s election could be good news for Ukraine. As we previously reported, he favors providing Kyiv with air-launched Taurus KEPD 350 cruise missiles, a 180-degree change from outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

The €40bn figure was mentioned by one member state and is seen as an outlier. The EU says it gave Ukraine €20bn ($21 billion) in military aid in 2024, a figure that is a starting point for the latest plan on the table. EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, suggested that the alliance 'would send Ukraine 'as soon as possible' at least 1.5m rounds of large-caliber ammunition, air-defense systems, missiles capable of deep precision strikes, drones, as well as offering training to brigades,' The Guardian reported. A decision is being passed to EU leaders, who will gather for an emergency summit in Brussels next Thursday, where they will also discuss European defense.

'I am not going to recognize $500 (billion),' Zelensky said during a press conference at a forum marking the third anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. That could take 250 years, Zelensky noted, adding that he could not sign anything that 'ten generations of Ukrainians' would have to pay back. Yesterday, Zelensky pushed back against Trump's demands. 'I know we had $100bn [of US assistance] but I’m not going to acknowledge $500bn, no matter what anyone says. I’m not going to sign something that 10 generations of Ukrainians will be paying for.' Christopher Miller (@ChristopherJM) February 24, 2025 Another reported objection to the deal was the U.S. threatening to cut off Elon Musk's Starlink internet system widely used by front-line units if Ukraine didn't agree to the terms. That report is now in question based on statements from Ukrainian officials. Regardless, Ukraine has alternatives for that system and is making decisions about the use of the technology, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said at the Ukraine: Year 2025 forum in Kyiv on Sunday. The head of Ukraine's Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR) said so far, Musk's Space X has not prevented Ukraine from using its Starlink satellite communications system. '​​The U.S. has the ability to remotely cut off Starlink connections and has previously turned off Starlinks belonging to Russian forces in the military ‘gray zone’, akin to no man’s land,' Lt. Gen.

Zelensky, for instance, suggested that in return for Ukrainian membership in NATO, he would be willing to resign. 'If (it guarantees) peace for Ukraine, if you really need me to resign, I am ready. I can exchange it for NATO,' he told reporters on Sunday. His statement came after Trump said that Zelensky needs to run for reelection again and declared him a dictator because he has frozen elections since the war began. As we previously reported, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that Kyiv joining NATO was unrealistic, upending the alliance’s stated policy that Ukraine was on an 'irreversible path' to membership.

'We hope that we can finish the war this year,' he said. Budanov said that he believes there will be a ceasefire with Russia this year, but its duration remains questionable. He described the situation as 'paradoxical' since the positions of Kyiv and Moscow are drastically opposite. 'At the same time, I think we will reach a ceasefire this year,' Budanov said. 'How long it will be, how effective it will be, is another question. But I think it will happen. Most of the components needed for this to happen are there.' Budanov added that he does not believe a peacekeeping force, like the one proposed by European leaders, will do much good. 'Can this be considered a guarantee?' he asked rhetorically. 'It’s questionable—let’s just say, very much in doubt.'

Though his forces have taken tremendous casualties and he is facing economic pressures at home, Putin sees his troops on the offensive and may decide it is to his advantage to continue fighting. Ukraine meanwhile, though exhausted, has little faith that Russia would live up to any agreements it signs. Still, there is a growing sense that Feb. 24, 2026 won't presage a fifth year of fighting. The Latest On the battlefield, the front lines continued to remain largely stagnant with Russia making some small gains in Luhansk Oblast while both sides inched forward in parts of Donetsk. Here are some key takeaways from the latest ISW assessment: Kursk: Russian forces continued offensive operations in Kursk Oblast on February 23 but did not make any confirmed advances. Kharkiv: Russian forces continued ground attacks in the Kharkiv direction on February 23 but did not advance. Luhansk: Russian forces continued ground attacks in the Kupyansk, Borova and Lyman directions on February 23 but did not make confirmed advances. Donetsk: Russian forces advanced in the Pokrovsk and Siversk directions while Ukraine advanced near Toretsk. Meanwhile, Russian forces continued offensive operations in the Chasiv Yar and Kurakhove directions on February 23 but did not advance Zaporizhia: Russian forces continued offensive operations in the Zaporizhia direction on February 23 but did not advance.

'There is no U.S. base in Alexandroupolis - it is a Greek facility that the U.S. has access to under the Mutual Defense Cooperation Agreement,' a U.S. defense official told The War Zone Monday morning. 'It simply serves as a surface transportation hub when U.S. equipment flows into and out of Europe. US transport personnel can surge to the location to manage episodic arrivals and departures of equipment, but this is not a US ‘base’ for the US to close.' The U.S. official's comments are in response to our questions about the future of this hub raised by Greek media. 'As the direct talks between the US and Russian delegations on the fate of Ukraine are considered positive and productive, the Trump administration will no longer send American material and personnel to Ukraine against Russia and therefore the American base in Alexandroupolis may be considered unnecessary,' the Greek gnomionline media outlet reported. In addition to not being a U.S. base to close, the official told us there was no anticipated change in the flow of equipment from the port. 'The U.S. population changes depending on the shipments, so it wouldn’t be strange for a small footprint to be there depending on the day,' the official added. 'Priority access to the Port of Alexandroupolis in northeastern Greece has allowed the U.S. military to continue to support Ukraine as that nation fights to maintain its sovereignty following the unprovoked February 24 invasion by Russia, the U.S. defense secretary told his Greek counterpart,' the Pentagon said in a statement released in July 2022, about five months after Russia launched its full-on invasion.

Taiwan Is Testing An Air Launched Supersonic Anti-Ship Missile	Taiwan appears to be moving toward adding a supersonic anti-ship cruise missile to its F-CK-1C/D Indigenous Defense Fighters (IDF). The current timeline for the introduction of the air-launched version of the homegrown HF-3 missile is unclear, but when fully integrated, it will provide the Republic of China Air Force (ROCAF) with a powerful new capability to better counter China’s growing naval might. A photo of an F-CK-1 carrying HF-3 missile was recently published by Taiwan’s United Daily News. The image, submitted by an anonymous reader of that newspaper, appears to show test rounds of the missile, which is part of the Hsiung Feng, or Brave Wind series. One of the large missiles is carried under each wing. The jet also has a 275-gallon fuel tank under the fuselage and AIM-9P Sidewinder air-to-air missiles on the wingtip stations. The HF-3 carries calibration marks, of the kind used to make it easier to monitor a store after launch. UDN published what appears to be the first clear image of an air-launched HF-3 dummy round, if not shopped.It seems to have a rotating sleeve at the end for initial stabilization? pic.twitter.com/KRrfTdqQ37&mdash; Taepodong (@stoa1984) February 21, 2025 Liberty Times just published another image.If goes well, it could lend the F-CK-1 a second life, maybe even leading to further development of an indigenous support fighter (ISF) — that is me fantasizing. pic.twitter.com/9UqHKZotBB&mdash; Taepodong (@stoa1984) February 21, 2025 The article notes that the ROCAF and the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST) have resumed work on the air-launched HF-3, 'which was previously reported to have been stalled for a long time.' The NCSIST, which originally developed the HF-3 for launch from warships and ground launchers, is a state research and development agency broadly similar to the Pentagon’s DARPA but with its own production capability. Reportedly, work originally began in 2022 to reduce the size of the HF-3 for aircraft carriage, including plans for the production of a small batch of the ‘compact’ version of the missile. The UDN story notes that, at some point after this, the project was suspended, but work had been restarted by September 2024, with further research and tests conducted 'in the sea and air.' As a result, the air-launched HF-3 should be ready to undergo operational evaluation later this year. A model of a surface/ground-launched HF-3 missile. The additional solid-propellant boosters are removed from the air-launched version. 玄史生/Wikimedia Commons The original plan for the air-launched HF-3 was intended to be completed by 2028, although it’s not immediately clear if this has since changed as a result of the program pause. According to the UDN report, the air-launched version of the HF-3 is 5.5 meters (18 feet) long, with a diameter of no more than 36 centimeters (14 inches), and a weight of less than 900 kilograms (1,980 pounds). The original HF-3 was 6.1 meters (20 feet) long, with a diameter of 46 centimeters (18 inches), and weighed around 1,400kg kilograms (3,090 pounds). As an air-launched anti-ship weapon, the HF-3 offers several notable advantages over the U.S.-supplied AGM-84 Harpoon otherwise used by the ROCAF in this role — although this is not compatible with the F-CK-1, instead being used by the F-16, as you can read about here. A ROCAF F-16 armed with Harpoon missiles during an anti-invasion drill on a highway road in Chang-Hua, Taiwan, in May 2019. Photo by Patrick Aventurier/Getty Images Aventurier Patrick The HF-3’s liquid-fuel ramjet motor provides supersonic performance, compared to the subsonic Harpoon. With a top speed of Mach 3.5, the HF-3 is much harder to defend against. Range figures published for the missile differ, with some accounts suggesting a short-range version can hit targets at around 120-150 kilometers (75-93 miles), increasing to 300-400 kilometers (186-249 miles) in long-range form. It’s unclear which version the air-launched HF-3 best corresponds to. However, launching the missile from a fast-moving fighter at altitude should help boost overall range regardless. In comparison, the air-launched Harpoon has a range of around 80 miles in the AGM-84L form that is the most capable model operated by the ROCAF. At the same time, air launch obviates the need for separate booster motors to bring the HF-3 up to the speed at which the ramjet can start to operate. According to reports, removing the solid-propellant boosters trimmed around 200 kilograms (440 pounds) from the missile’s weight, helping make it more suitable for aircraft carriage. However, further weight and size-reduction measures were still necessary. Like Harpoon, the HF-3 is guided by an inertial navigation system (INS) with terminal active radar homing. In surface/ground-launched form it is armed with a 265-pound high-explosive, semi-armor piercing warhead, although this may well be smaller in the air-launched version. The warhead is reportedly triggered by a smart fuse designed to direct most of the explosive energy downward, into the ship’s hull, for maximum destructive effect. Test launch of an HF-3 missile from a Tuo Chiang class corvette of the Republic of China Navy. Taiwan Ministry of National Defense Chinese naval forces have been rapidly expanding in recent years, in general, which has already prompted the Taiwanese military to seek a variety of new and improved anti-ship capabilities. Anti-ship missiles launched from the land, from warships, and from ROCAF fighters are already a very important component of Taiwan’s defensive plans, designed to thwart a potential Chinese move on the island. In an ROCAF context, TWZ has previously reported: 'The pairing of F-16 and AGM-84 Harpoon is a key element in Taiwan’s ability to defend important strategic waterways and territorial claims against a maritime opponent. The ROCAF operates a mix of older Harpoons plus the newer Block II AGM-84Ls.' You can read more about Taiwan’s AGM-84s here and about the missile in general in this past TWZ piece. A model of an HF-3 missile during the Kaohsiung International Maritime and Defense Exhibition in 2016. SAM YEH/AFP via Getty Images SAM YEH The air-launched HF-3 would be a potent complement to the Harpoon. This is especially true when it comes to pushing anti-ship missile kill zones farther from Taiwan’s shores and in a far more unpredictable and responsive manner. However, it would likely be limited to carriage by the F-CK-1, at least in the shorter term. If a war with China were to break out, anti-ship missiles of all kinds would be absolutely critical in providing Taiwan with any hope of slowing an all-out advance by the People’s Liberation Army Navy. As such, the continued effort to field a more capable air-launched anti-ship missile is increasingly seen as a necessary deterrent as tensions between Taipei and Beijing continue.

Aircraft Carrier USS Harry S. Truman Back At Sea After Collision ...	The U.S. Navy aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman is back at sea conducting routine operations after a week or so in port in Greece for repairs. Truman collided with the cargo ship M/V Besiktas-M in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Egypt’s Port Said earlier this month. The Navy announced today that Truman is now conducting routine operations in the Mediterranean after leaving Greece's Souda Bay yesterday following a so-called Emergent Repair Availability (ERAV). The carrier first arrived in Souda Bay for the ERAV, which was immediately preceded by a more comprehensive damage assessment, on February 16. The collision, which occured on February 12, had caused damage to various parts of the aft starboard end of the flattop, as you can read more about here. Engineering department officers, assigned to the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75) and Forward Deployed Regional Maintenance Center inspectors assess the exterior damage of the ship on February 16, 2025, while completing an emergent repair availability at U.S. Naval Support Activity (NSA) Souda Bay. USN Seaman Michael Gomez 'Led by Forward Deployed Regional Maintenance Center (FDRMC), Truman completed the five-day ERAV at Naval Support Activity (NSA) Souda Bay, Greece,' according to a Navy press release. 'In an all-hands effort, Sailors worked with FDRMC personnel, Norfolk Naval Shipyard, and local industry partner Theodoropoulos Group to assess damage, develop a repair plan, and restore weathertight integrity to the ship following the collision on Feb. 12.' A picture the Navy previously released showing damage to the aft starboard end of the USS Harry S. Truman following the collision with the M/V Besiktas-M. USN Another look at some of the collision damage to Truman. USN 'FDRMC is focused on keeping our forward-deployed naval forces mission-ready across 5th and 6th Fleets, maintaining critical combat readiness for the ships and their Sailors,' Navy Capt. Mollie Bily, the FDRMC's commanding officer, said in a statement. 'The rapid repair effort on Truman was a testament to our expeditionary maintenance expertise and the exceptional collaboration with our Norfolk Naval Shipyard teammates and industry partners.' The Navy has not yet released any details about the cost of these repairs or of the total damage Truman sustained in the collision. What additional repairs might still be required and what the timeline might be for conducting that work is unknown. TWZ has reached for more information. 'Our ship remains operationally ready to complete deployment with mission and purpose on full display by the entire crew,' Navy Capt. Christopher Hill, Truman's commanding officer, also said in a statement. 'We are out here launching and recovering aircraft, ready to ‘Give ‘em Hell’ with combat credible power.' An F/A-18 Super Hornet launches from the USS Harry S. Truman on February 15, 2025. USN MC2 Emily Guillory Also known by his callsign 'Chowdah,' Hill took command of the Truman on February 20 after the Navy relieved Capt. Dave Snowden 'due to a loss of confidence in his ability to command' following the collision. An investigation into the incident remains underway. Chowdah Hill is stepping in. Quite the endorsement from the USN Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) February 20, 2025 Hill had previously commanded the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower during a deployment between November 2023 and June 2024 that included months of intense combat in and around the Red Sea. You can learn more about that cruise in our exclusive interview with 'Chowdah' Hill. Prior to the collision, Truman and its embarked air wing, as well as the rest of its strike group, had also been conducting operations in and around the Red Sea. 'Since deploying, Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 1 has flown over 5,500 sorties, including two self-defense strikes into Houthi-controlled Yemen territory and a large force strike against ISIS-Somalia targets in Northeast Somalia in coordination with U.S. Africa Command,' according to today's Navy release. 'The Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group continues to provide maritime security and regional stability in support of its component commanders.' TWZ has previously highlighted the importance of getting Truman, the only U.S. carrier currently in the region, back on station as quickly as possible to avoid any major operational impacts. In addition, performing even limited no-notice repairs at Souda Bay could have provided the Navy with useful data to help refine and improve procedures for handling battle damage on forward-deployed ships. The service's current capacity, or lack thereof, to readily repair battle-damaged ships has been a particular area of concern for years now, especially in the context of preparing for a future high-end fight, such as one against China in the Pacific. Whatever repairs Truman might still require, the carrier is now back conducting routine operations. Contact the author: joe@twz.com The post Aircraft Carrier USS Harry S.

Su-57 Felon’s First Visit To Iran Seen In Satellite Imagery	A Russian Su-57 Felon fighter recently touched down in Iran on its way back home from the Aero India 2025 international airshow. This appears to be the first known instance of one of the new-generation Russian jets stopping over in Iran for any reason. Satellite imagery indicates the Felon was at the Iranian airbase in Bandar Abbas in the southeastern end of the country for multiple days, and it is not entirely clear if it has now departed. TWZ obtained a satellite image, seen at the top of this story, showing the Su-57 at Bandar Abbas, which lies on the Persian Gulf, on February 19 from Maxar Technologies. A pair of U.S.-made P-3 Orion maritime patrol planes, sold to Iran before the fall of the Shah in 1979, and a Russian-built Il-76 Candid cargo plane, are visible, as well. This aligns with a video, seen below, that has emerged that is said to show the Felon, which has the bort number Blue 054, at the Iranian base next to a Russian Il-76 with the registration RA-76373. That Candid was also in India as of February 18, according to online flight tracking data. Iran does operate Il-76s, as well.

VCG/VCG via Getty Images Whether or not the Su-57 has now left Bandar Abbas or may just have been moved to another part of the base is unclear. Another video, seen below, is said to show the jet taking off at the Iranian base and has been making the rounds online since at least February 20. At the same time, there are unconfirmed claims circulating on social media that the Felon's stay in Iran was extended due to engine issues. The satellite imagery pointing to the jet still being there as of at least February 21 would lend some credence to those claims. Engine trouble has certainly been a recurring theme in the Su-57's history.

(@mhmiranusa) February 20, 2025 Russian military aircraft have made use of Iranian bases in the past, including as staging points for combat operations over Syria. Bandar Abbas is a logical intermediate point between Bengaluru in India where the Aero India 2025 show was held and Russia's current main Su-57 hub at Akhtubinsk Air Base in the southeastern end of the country. The Su-57's appearance in Iran does come amid new discussions about the jet's future on the open market with Algeria now having become the type's first export customer. This looks set to be an important shot in the arm for the Felon, which has been slow to enter Russia service, let alone attract foreign sales. Alegia's announcement came earlier this month around the Aero India 2025 show, where the jet also shared the ramp for the first time with a U.S. F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. A bilateral partnership between Russia and India on the Su-57 that began in the early 2000s had notably collapsed by 2018, as you can read more about here. Blue 054 and a U.S. F-35 Joint Strike Fighter seen together at Aero India 2025. PJSC United Aircraft Corporation/Anadolu via Getty Images There are no clear indications one way or the other that the Russians may have taken the current opportunity to more formally show off the Su-57 to Iranian officials at Bandar Abbas. There have been no reliable reports to date about active Iranian interest in acquiring the Felon. Even if Iran were to move to operate Su-57s, there would be immediate questions about its ability to operate and maintain the aircraft. The Felon is dramatically more complex than anything in Iran's current aging fighter inventory. Iran has said it is in the process of acquiring Russian Su-35 Flanker-Es, which would also represent a major boost in capability over its existing tactical jet fleets. That sale has been tied to Iranian assistance to Russia with regard to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, especially the sale of kamikaze drones and helping Moscow establish its capacity to produce them domestically. There is added emphasis now for Tehran to improve its air and missile defense capabilities and capacity after Israel struck multiple prized sites and key assets deep inside the country essentially with impunity in the past year. It is worth noting that it is unclear if Israeli aircraft ever entered Iran's airspace in the course of those operations. Whether or not Blue 054 is still at Bandar Abbas or if Su-57s start making more regular appearances in Iran, the stopover at the Iranian base does come at some of a new moment in the Felon's story.

The B-52 had earlier appeared over Tallinn to mark Estonian Independence Day, the national day of the Baltic State, but broader geopolitical developments in the region put the flight in a different context. While over Tallinn, the strategic bomber joined a formation with four F-35A stealth fighters and a pair of F/A-18 Hornets. The F-35s were very likely Royal Netherlands Air Force examples that are currently conducting the Baltic Air Policing mission out of Ämari Air Base in Estonia. Meanwhile, the F/A-18s were from the Finnish Air Force.

It should be noted that overflights of Tallinn have happened before for Estonian Independence Day and have also previously involved B-52s. On the other hand, the signaling of this type of flight cannot be entirely overlooked, especially coming amid something of a reset in relations between the United States and Russia — and between Washington and NATO — since President Donald Trump took office. The B-52, from the 5th Bomb Wing from Minot Air Force Base, North Dakota, is one of two currently at RAF Fairford in England as part of a routine Bomber Task Force (BTF) deployment.

Kristen Heller Such deployments regularly involve missions in and around the Baltic Sea, an area of considerable importance, especially since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent East-West tensions. Earlier today, after flying over Tallinn, the B-52 continued in an eastward direction, heading toward Saint Petersburg. Based on publicly available data from online flight-tracking websites, the bomber came to within around 50 miles of the Russia-Estonia border before turning south.

This brought the bomber to within around 10 miles of the Belarusian border, again based on online flight-tracking data. It’s worth noting that it’s not unheard of for U.S. bombers to pass through this area.

As such, this has become a choke point and an area of great strategic and military importance to NATO and Russia. Were a conflict ever to break out in the region, Russian control of the Suwalki Gap would cut the three Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia off from the rest of the European Union and it would create a land bridge to Kaliningrad.

Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images SeanGallup Again, the symbolic nature of a B-52 flight in these specific areas is hard to ignore. For the three Baltic States in particular, today’s B-52 sortie may be seen as a reminder of U.S. commitment to their continued independence in the face of an increasingly belligerent Russia. So far, the U.S. Department of Defense has not issued an official statement about the flight. However, in 2023, when a pair of B-52s also flew over Tallinn for Estonian Independence Day, U.S. Air Force Gen. James Hecker, commander of U.S. Air Forces in Europe-Air Forces Africa, and NATO Allied Air Command said: 'The United States and Estonia are close allies and share a strong partnership based on a common commitment to democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. We remain steadfastly committed to the freedom and sovereignty of Estonia and all our Baltic allies as we deter and defend against any threats to our shared security.' Such commitment is now in shorter supply, at least as far as the messaging from the Trump administration. In recent weeks, Trump has branded Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a 'dictator' and blamed Kyiv for starting the war with Russia. At the same time, there has been a sudden move to normalize relations between Washington and Moscow. For his part, Vance, speaking at the Munich Security Conference earlier this month, accused European leaders of suppressing free speech, failing to halt illegal migration, and betraying its 'most fundamental values.' U.S. Vice President JD Vance speaks during the 61st Munich Security Conference on February 14, 2025, in Munich, Germany. Photo by Johannes Simon/Getty Images Johannes Simon Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has said that the United States 'is no longer the primary guarantor of security in Europe.' These are words that will be of particular concern for the Baltic States, which rely to a huge extent on their NATO allies for defense. Traditionally, of course, NATO’s posture in Europe has been backed up by plausible nuclear deterrence — reinforced by the nuclear-capable B-52 and regular BTF deployments. Amid a general realignment of U.S. foreign policy priorities, and Washington’s changing expectations of NATO — that guarantee now looks rather more questionable. With that in mind, a show of force like the one conducted today carries some powerful signals not only for Russia, but also for the Baltic States and, more broadly, to other members of the NATO alliance who have no doubt been alarmed by recent messages from the Trump administration to Europe.

Hezbollah's current Secretary General Naim Qassem addressed the public remotely during the funeral, vowing to follow Nasrallah’s example 'even if we are all killed.' Hezbollah has been deeply degraded by Israel's campaign against it, with much of its leadership being killed, thousands of its operatives wounded by sabotaged communications devices, and many of its fighters killed and its higher-end weapons destroyed during a protracted ground and air operation. The fall of Syria's strongman Bashar al-Assad also has had a major impact on the group's ability to rebuild its capabilities, both logistically and operationally. The loss of Assad also impacted Iran heavily, who used Syria to supply and support Hezbollah. A ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah was signed in November. IAF over Beirut International (IAF) IAF over Beirut (IAF) IAF fighters over the procession (IAF) The overtly ironic formation flyover — an act usually reserved for highly-honored military persons within a society — occurred at low altitude over Southern Beirut, which served as a reminder of Israel's total aerial supremacy over the area. This is especially true following the regime change in Syria, after which Israel struck all of Assad's known air defense capabilities. Russian air defenses in Syria, which reached out over a broad area, have also largely packed up and left. Still, such a flight profile is not without risk. Small arms fire or a sudden mechanical issue could leave few options flying that low and fast over a hostile area in broad daylight and during a time when your sworn enemies are already massed and rife with hatred. The flyover also came amid multiple airstrikes carried out by Israel on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon. Screenshot Today is Hassan Nasrallah’s funeral.

U.S.-Ukrainian Mineral Deal Getting Close To Fruition	Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky will soon sign a minerals agreement with the United States potentially worth hundreds of billions of dollars, White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said Friday. That move is part of U.S. President Donald Trump’s effort to end the war with Russia and a deal the American leader says will recoup billions in military aid provided to Kyiv. 'Here’s the bottom line: President Zelensky is going to sign that deal, and you will see that in the very short term,' Waltz said during remarks at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), according to The Guardian. Zelensky to sign US minerals deal soon, Waltz says.U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz said on Feb. 21 that President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to sign a minerals deal with the U.S. 'in the very short term,' the Guardian reported.

'This is an agreement that can strengthen our relations, and the key is to work out the details to ensure its effectiveness. I look forward to the outcome – a just result.'

The exact terms could not be learned. Asked if this would go through, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office Friday: 'I think they want it. They feel good about it.' U.S. and Ukrainian officials negotiated all night into Friday morning to ink an agreement and end the souring Zelesnky-Trump relations, Axios reported, citing a U.S. official and a source with direct knowledge of the issue. Ukrainian, US officials negotiated throughout the night amid minerals deal dispute, Axios reports.Ukrainian and U.S. officials were at the table overnight and into the morning discussing an 'improved' bilateral rare earth mineral deal on Feb. 21, Axios reported.…&mdash; The Kyiv Independent (@KyivIndependent) February 21, 2025 The pending deal would give the U.S. access to Ukraine’s deposits of critical minerals including aluminum, gallium and titanium, Waltz said. As we previously reported, Ukraine possesses materials that are essential components of microchips and electric vehicle batteries and have significant military value. Trump has been touting this as a way to reduce the burden for supporting Ukraine, with Waltz claiming US aid to Kyiv has exceeded $175 billion, The Guardian reported. That figure, as we have explained before, contradicts information compiled by the Kiel Institute For The World Economy’s Ukraine Support Tracker, which shows that the U.S. has provided Ukraine with a little less than $120 billion from the U.S. More than half – $66.5 billion – was for direct security assistance in the form of donated weapons, according to Pentagon figures. Data compiled by the Kiel Institute shows Europe outpaced the U.S. in aid to Ukraine. (Kiel Institute) Last week, the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, presented Zelensky with the draft proposal for that plan, with Ukraine providing approximately $500 billion worth of rare earth elements to the U.S., The Guardian explained. There were claims that Bessent told the Ukrainian president to sign the deal on the spot, but we can't confirm that. News about the looming mineral deal came as the war of words between Trump and Zelensky continues to escalate in the wake of peace talks in Saudi Arabia between the U.S. and Moscow that did not include Ukraine. In comments to Fox News radio host Brian Kilmeade on Friday, Trump blasted Zelensky as a poor negotiator, and called Bessent’s trip 'dangerous' and 'a waste of time.' The pair 'couldn't even come close' to a deal, Trump told Kilmeade. Ukrainian officials, however, said that they had only a few hours to study it before it was presented to them. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he was 'very upset' with Zelensky over the deal, claiming the Ukrainian leader misrepresented the outcome of a meeting he had with Rubio and Vice President J.D. Vance. Zelensky said he wanted to make the deal but needed the approval of his legislature, Rubio said. However, 'I read two days later that Zelensky is out there saying ‘I rejected the deal. I told him, No way that we're not doing that.’ Well, that's not what happened in that meeting,' Rubio explained. 'So you start to get upset by something. We're trying to help these guys.' Trump: Zelensky had the most beautiful cities, and now they’re all destroyed.Host: But that’s Putin’s fault, wouldn’t you agree?Trump: I’m tired of hearing that, I’ll tell you that much.Host: Isn’t Putin to blame?Trump: *ignores the question* pic.twitter.com/LjWaMzOVBJ&mdash; Clash Report (@clashreport) February 21, 2025 As we previously noted, it’s one thing to strike a deal, but something else entirely to extract and process the resources. A little more than half of Ukraine’s mineral resources are contained in the four regions Russian President Vladimir Putin annexed in September 2022, and of which his army occupies a considerable swathe, The Independent reported earlier this month. That includes Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, though Kherson holds little value in terms of minerals, the publication added. The Crimean peninsula, annexed and occupied by Russian forces in 2014, also holds billions in mineral wealth, The Independent added. Regardless of the difficulty though, it seems that both sides see value in a mineral deal. Signing it could go a long way to cooling the tensions between Trump and Zelensky that have erupted over the past week. The Latest On the battlefield, the bulk of the fighting continues to rage in eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk region, but despite strong Russian pressure, its forces are making few advances. Here are the key takeaways from the latest Institute for the Study of War (ISW) assessment.

'I think the Russians want to see the war end, I really do. I think they have the cards a little bit, because they've taken a lot of territory. They have the cards,' Trump told the BBC on Air Force One. When asked if he trusts that Russia wants peace, Trump said 'I do.' Trump says Russia 'have the cards' in peace negotiations BBC News (World) (@BBCWorld) February 20, 2025 Russia used the first round of the recently concluded negotiations with the U.S. over ending the war in Ukraine to demand the withdrawal of NATO forces from the alliance’s eastern flank, the Financial Times reported. That triggered concern in European capitals that the Trump administration 'could acquiesce to seal a peace deal,' the publication suggested. The Romanian president’s chief of staff and adviser for defense and national security said while the U.S. delegation had rejected Moscow’s demand, there were no guarantees that Washington would not eventually make this concession to Vladimir Putin. ''As far as I understand, the situation can change from hour to hour or from day to day,''' Cristian Diaconescu told Antena3 television,' FT noted. Diaconescu was referring to Trump’s scathing criticism of Zelensky as well as the American leader's 'concessions made to Russia even before talks began,' according to FT. Diaconescu 'stressed that the Russian delegation to the talks in Riyadh earlier this week 'failed to convince the Americans' on a NATO withdrawal and that further visits by the leaders of the UK and France to Washington next week would seek to persuade Trump not to give in to this demand,' FT wrote. There is a growing list of U.S. legislators objecting to Trump’s harsh comments about Zelensky, including calling the Ukrainian leader a 'dictator.' Several Republican Senators broke ranks with the president about that assessment, including Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, and John Thune of South Dakota. 'I would certainly never refer to President Zelensky as a dictator,' Murkowski told reporters. 'It is quite clear who started the war. It was absolutely Russia at Putin's directive.'

The plan calls for fewer than 30,000 troops 'deployed to Ukrainian cities, ports and other critical infrastructure sites, such as nuclear power stations, far away from the current front lines,' the publication reported. Starmer will reportedly urge Trump 'to have U.S. fighter jets and missiles on standby in Eastern Europe to respond with lethal force if Russia breaks the terms of any armistice,' The Telegraph noted, citing 'Western officials briefed on the plans.' 'Rather than stationing a much bigger force in the war-torn country, the mission will rely on ‘technical monitoring,’ including intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft, drones and satellites to provide a ‘complete picture of what is going on,' The Telegraph stated, citing a Western official. 'The operation would be backed up by enough firepower to ‘monitor and shoot those attacks down,’' to reopen Ukraine’s airspace and enable commercial flights, the source added.

The package, which should include everything from 1.5 million artillery shells to air defense systems, 'would mark one of the EU's largest military aid packages since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022 and could be unveiled ahead of a highly symbolic visit by European commissioners to Kyiv on Feb. 24,' Politico noted. Two of the diplomats said the package could be 'increased to up to €10 billion ($10.5 billion) or more as countries dig into their inventories to see what they can send to Ukraine,' Politico posited.

In addition, despite Putin’s efforts to paint the Russian economy as robust, inflation in that country has been rising due to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, 'Russia primarily recruits volunteer soldiers through large individual payments and has had to increase payments significantly to sustain recruitment. Russian lenders show signs of uncertainty about Russia's economic future and the solvency of Kremlin coffers,' ISW stated. 'Putin’s protracted war in Ukraine is destroying Russia’s national wealth through the steady erosion of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund and growing inflation. The Kremlin has been trying in recent months to reduce state spending on benefits to military personnel, indicating that the Kremlin is aware that it cannot continue such high spending and must find ways to cut costs.' These factors are contributing to Russia's current force generation apparatus appearing to be 'unable to recruit the manpower that the Russian military needs to sustain Russia's current rate of offensive operations.' ISW posited. To convince the Russian populous not to worry, the Kremlin 'has been engaged in an information campaign in recent months that aims to posture the Russian economy as strong and stable to both domestic and international audiences, and the state of Russia's economy is likely more strained than Kremlin officials publicly acknowledge,' ISW suggested. 3/ The Kremlin has been engaged in an information campaign in recent months that aims to posture the Russian economy as strong and stable to both domestic and international audiences, and the state of Russia's economy is likely more strained than Kremlin officials publicly… pic.twitter.com/VBlkrFITBI&mdash; Institute for the Study of War (@TheStudyofWar) February 20, 2025 Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk 'has called on the European Union to confiscate the assets of the Russian Central Bank, which are frozen due to sanctions, to finance future financial support for Ukraine,' Euronews reported. 'So far, the bloc has only used the extraordinary revenues of the assets held in its territory, estimated to be worth €210 billion (about $220 billion), to deliver financial and military assistance to the war-torn nation,' the publication reported. 'The option of asset confiscation remains a slippery slope, however, because the money is considered Russia's sovereign property and is therefore protected by international law.'

A new study by RUSI shows just how effective they’ve been, causing the majority of damage to Russian equipment of any weapon in Ukraine’s arsenal. That's despite challenges presented by electronic warfare (EW), weather and interference caused by multiple drones operating in the same area. 'Tactical UAVs have significant limitations,' the report states. 'Between 60% and 80% of Ukrainian [first-person view] FPVs fail to reach their target, depending on the part of the front and the skill of the operators. Of those that do strike their targets, a majority fail to destroy the target system when striking armored vehicles.' The success rate in wounding infantry is high, the report notes. 'Furthermore, there are long periods where either EW or the weather significantly degrades UAV operations. With FPVs that are remotely piloted by radio frequency, it is also difficult to concentrate multiple drones in time and space because they can interfere with one another’s guidance systems,' the report continues. 'Despite these limitations, tactical UAVs currently account for 60%–70% of damaged and destroyed Russian systems,' RUSI found. 'A key finding is that tactical drones are inflicting roughly two-thirds of Russian losses…twice as effective as every other weapon in the Ukr arsenal put together…remarkable…for weapons which did not officially exist in the Ukr mil at start of the war' Shashank Joshi (@shashj) February 20, 2025 To help defend against Ukrainian drone attacks, some Russian troops are kitted out with backpack-style electronic warfare countermeasures bristling with antennae and hooked into a portable power supply.

Earlier this month, we told you about a mile-long mesh net 'tunnel' Russian forces were using to protect convoys against onslaughts of Ukrainian’s first-person view drones. Ukrainians, however, found a quick workaround. Just destroy the netting. 'This may involve using drones equipped with flammable thermal mixtures or deploying other types of drones to destroy the net—such as heavy bombers—before engaging with classic FPV drones,' Michael, the commander of Ukraine’s Typhoon drone unit, recently told Forbes.

'The upgraded Shahed-136 now carries a 90-kilogram warhead, nearly double the explosive capacity of the previous 50-kilogram version,' GUR explained, according to the Kyiv Independent. Though significantly enhancing the Shahed’s destructive power, the heavier payload has reduced its range from 1,350 kilometers (839 miles) to about 650 kilometers (404 miles), limiting its reach but making it deadlier in closer-range attacks.

However, as the war progressed, drones became a greater danger and both sides added extra armor and often massive so-called cope cages to protect against them.

North Korean troops deployed to Russia are adapting quickly, gaining firsthand experience in modern warfare with Russian military support—an alarming development that could reshape security dynamics in East Asia, Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov told the Chosun Daily. 'This war has mobilized the full military capabilities of the nations involved. Only three countries—Ukraine, Russia, and North Korea—are gaining direct experience in full-scale 21st-century warfare. The North Korean military of the future will be fundamentally different from its past,' Budanov explained. He cited the KN-23 missile that North Korea supplied to Russia as an example. 'Initially, its accuracy was severely flawed, with an error margin of 500 to 1,500 meters,' he said. 'But Russian missile experts made technical modifications, resolving the issue. The missile is now significantly more precise and a far greater threat.' He warned that this technological advancement could have serious security implications for South Korea and Japan, both of which are within North Korea’s missile range. 'North Korea is using this war to gain combat experience and modernize its military technology,' Budanov said. 'This will have lasting consequences for the security landscape in the Asia-Pacific region.'

Drone-Equipped U.S. Marines Now Helping Protect Baltic Se Submari...	About 40 drone-equipped U.S. Marines have been sent to Finland to join NATO’s Baltic Sentry effort to protect undersea cables in the wake of several instances of suspected sabotage, according to the Finnish Defense Ministry (MoD) and U.S. Marine Corps. That news comes as Swedish Police say they are investigating a potential new break in a cable running between Gotland and Germany, the latest in a series of such incidents. While U.S. Marines routinely train with Finnish forces and U.S. Navy P-8 surveillance aircraft have already participated in Baltic Sentry, this marks the first commitment of American troops. Baltic Sentry was stood up last month by 10 NATO nations in the wake of the suspected sabotage in December of undersea power and communications cables between Finland and Estonia.

Shane Beaubien The Marines will use hand-launched RQ-20 Puma surveillance drones to 'provide additional maritime domain awareness' to Baltic Sentry, according to the Marine Corps. The Pumas 'are capable of being operated from sea and land, but their employment will be determined by the Finnish and Marine Corps team on the ground,' Lt. Col. Zach Leuthardt, a spokesman for U.S. Marine Corps Forces Europe, told us. U.S. Marine Corps Cpl.

(U.S. Marine Corps photo by Lance Cpl. Sydni Jessee) Lance Cpl. Sydni Jessee The Marine platoon 'will help create the recognized maritime picture and monitor critical undersea infrastructure in the Gulf of Finland by identifying and tracking vessel movements together with the Finnish Navy,' the Finnish MoD said in a statement. The Recognized Maritime picture 'is created based on multiple different sensors and the analysis formed from this data,' the Finnish MoD told us. 'The USMC platoon will use capabilities such as UAVs that can supplement the current Recognized Maritime picture. In other words, they are one node in the network that collects movement of the ships in the Baltic Sea. Sensors that USMC uses are not armed and thus there is no need for specific Rules of Engagement.' 'Having the US Marine Corps unit in Finland and as part of NATO’s Baltic Sentry will strengthen the security of Finland and the Baltic Sea region.' Finnish Defense Minister Antti Häkkänen said in a statement. 'This cooperation is a continuation of our active international exercises with our Allies.' The Marines arrived this week and the length of their deployment has not yet been determined, the Finnish MoD told us. They came to Europe 'to train as part of Marine Rotational Force Europe and were dynamically re-tasked to support Baltic Sentry,' Luethardt explained, adding that they are well-suited for this mission. 'The Marine Corps’ ability to be an expeditionary and agile force, with expertise in littoral environments, makes us a logical partner for this type of enhanced vigilance activity,' Leuthardt noted. 'This is another milestone in our long-standing collaborative relationship with Finland and NATO. This mission will set conditions for European allies to bolster their NATO contributions and capabilities.' U.S. Marines undergoing training with Finnish troops. (NATO) The deployment is mutually beneficial, a spokesman Gen. Christopher G. Cavoli, the Supreme Allied Commander Europe of NATO (SACEUR), told The War Zone Friday morning. 'This is a great opportunity for the two countries to work together, and with other Allies, on an important issue for both America and Europe - the protection of critical undersea infrastructure,' Army Col. Martin O’Donnell said. 'This is also a great opportunity for the Marines to hone their cold weather skills. The Arctic is a focus of NATO and the U.S. and anytime we partner with a country like Finland, it is a good thing for the Marines, America and the Finns.' Having Marines deployed on this mission fits into their new doctrine of positioning small units in littoral areas inside an enemy's weapons engagement zone (WEZ), though that has been largely focused on the Pacific. 'Being forward inside the weapons engagement zone, with allies and partners, reassuring them every day, by walking the real estate with them, that is deterrence,' Marine Corps Lt. Gen. Karsten Heckl told a virtual panel held by the Center for International and Strategic Studies in 2022. A Marine Javelin team operates from a small inflatable rubber boat during Exercise Castaway 21.1. (USMC) Highlighting the need for this cooperation, the Swedish Police on Friday announced that they are investigating 'a possible cable break in the Baltic Sea…within the Swedish economic zone. The preliminary investigation into suspected sabotage was opened so that the police can have access to the tools needed to clarify what happened and whether it is a new or old damage.' There are no suspects yet, the police stated, adding that they are 'cooperating with the relevant authorities and have no further information to share at this time.'

'Sweden’s Coast Guard was informed of the purported break yesterday and is investigating.' There have been several instances of suspected sabotage of undersea cables, with Russia and China as the prime suspects. According to Finnish authorities, the Russian-linked Eagle S oil tanker severed the Estlink 2 undersea power cable and four telecommunications cables with its anchor in December. The ship, found to be brimming with spy equipment, was seized and authorities are continuing their investigation. You can see that ship after it was seized by Finnish authorities in the following video. In November, Germany said damage to two communication cables running under the Baltic Sea was most likely the result of sabotage. The two cables in question are both fiber-optic communication cables, running along the Baltic seabed. One runs between the Swedish island of Gotland and Lithuania, and the other between Finland and Germany. Gotland is about 280 miles southwest of where the Estlink 2 cable was severed. A day later, Denmark confirmed it was monitoring a Chinese cargo vessel at the center of allegations surrounding that damage. The 735-foot-long Yi Peng 3 was identified as operating near the cables when the incidents occurred. The Chinese vessel had departed the Russian port of Ust-Luga, in the Leningrad region, close to the Estonian border, on Nov. 15 and had been scheduled to sail to Port Said, Egypt, where it was originally due to arrive on Dec. 3. Last month, Swedish Defense Minister Carl-Oskar Bohlin announced that the Norbalt undersea power cable linking Sweden with Lithuania was likely also purposely damaged by the Yi Peng 3 as well. Officials suspect the Yi Peng 3 of severing at least three cables running underneath the Baltic Sea. (Photo by Mikkel Berg Pedersen / Ritzau Scanpix / AFP) / Denmark) The deployment of the Marines to Baltic Sentry comes against the backdrop of the ongoing war in Ukraine, which will mark its third anniversary on Monday. It is part of a greater effort by NATO to establish a more ready force in the face of potential Russian aggression. '&#8230;we will have a rigorous exercise program to enhance our readiness,' Cavoli, the SACEUR, said during a NATO press conference last month. 'Allied Command Operations has nearly 100 separate exercises planned in 2025.' At that press conference, Cavoli stressed there would be limited U.S. involvement in Baltic Sentry, a sign that NATO is more than just an American operation. 'There's not a single U.S contribution to that,' he said at the time. 'I think I'm the only U.S. contribution to it, in fact. So this is an alliance that is not a one-trick pony. This is an alliance that is capable of doing things and is rapidly gaining the ability to do more and more.' This was before the Navy’s P-8s flew surveillance missions and the Marines were sent in. Whether there will be additional U.S. contributions to Baltic Sentry remains to be seen. 'We don’t speculate about future operations, but would reemphasize what NATO leaders have said in that Baltic Sentry is primarily about regional allies helping regional Allies,' Arlo Abrahamson, a NATO spokesman, told us.

China’s Sudden Live Fire Naval Drills Off Australia Rattle Canber...	A rare Chinese naval drill with a previously unannounced live-fire component has disrupted air traffic over and around the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand. Authorities in Australia say they only learned that the Chinese ships would be firing some of their weapons after the crews of commercial airliners flying overhead received alerts. In addition to the signals this particular incident sends, the general presence of the flotilla in the region underscores the increasing reach of a steadily larger and more capable People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) beyond China's own shores. The PLAN's Type 055 destroyer Zunyi, Type 054A frigate Hengyang, and Type 903 replenishment ship Weishanhu have been sailing south in international waters to the east of Australia since at least last week. Often referred to as a cruiser given its size, the Type 055 is one of the most modern and capable warships in Chinese service today. Elements of the Australian and New Zealand armed forces, including warships and P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol planes, have been shadowing their movements. A picture Australian authorities previously released of the Type 054A frigate Hengyang sailing waters to the east of the country. Australian Defense Force 'We weren't notified by China, we became aware of the issue during the course of the day,' Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles said while speaking to ABC Radio Perth earlier today. 'What China did was put out a notification that it was intending to engage in live fire, and by that I mean a broadcast that was picked up by airlines, literally commercial planes that were flying across the Tasman.' 'I can understand why this was probably … very disconcerting for the airlines,' Marles added, stressing that Australia typically gives 12 to 24 hours notice ahead of live-fire exercises. Based on information in alerts shared via the international Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS), the Chinese drills occurred in an area roughly 400 miles (340 nautical miles) to the southeast of the Australian city of Sydney. An Emirates flight heading from Sydney in Australia to New Zealand's Christchurch was reportedly directly hailed by the Chinese flotilla warning the aircraft to stay at least 19 nautical miles away from where they were operating. Qantas and Air New Zealand have now made changes to the routes their planes take over and around the Tasman Sea, and other airlines have reportedly done the same. Civilian aviation authorities in Australia have now issued formal 'advice' regarding air traffic around where the Chinese ships are operating.

'The ABC understands the Chinese vessels were seen deploying a floating target, changing formation and then resetting formation consistent with a live fire event,' according to that outlet. 'However, it is understood the Australian military did not observe the vessels firing on the target.' Inflatable floating targets, typically red or bright orange in color, and often referred to as 'killer tomatoes' as a result, are routinely used in maritime training exercises, especially live-fire gunnery drills, by armed forces around the world. Chinese sailors drop a 'killer tomato' target off the side of a ship during training in the South China Sea. China Military Online Whether the Chinese ships will conduct additional live-fire drills while they are in the Tasman Sea or elsewhere in the region is unknown. 'This is activity that has occurred in waters consistent with international law,' Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has said. 'There has been no imminent risk of danger to any Australian assets or New Zealand assets.' 'The [People's Liberation Army] Southern Theatre Command organized the Chinese fleet to conduct a far seas exercise,' Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry, said, according to ABC. 'The drill was carried out in a safe, standard, and professional manner in accordance with the relevant international law and international practice.' At the same time, the Chinese flotilla's actions today, as well as its general presence in the region, are clearly at best atypical. Prime Minister Albanese has already drawn criticism within Australia for his muted response. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, at the podium, and, to his left, Richard Marles, now Australia's Defense Minister, at a press conference in 2022. David Gray/Getty Images DAVID GRAY 'There is no doubt that this is, not unprecedented, but an unusual event,' Australian Defense Minister Marles had also told Sky News television yesterday just about the arrival of the Chinese ships in waters to the east of Australia. 'We have not been informed by the Chinese government why this task group has been deployed into our region, and we have not been informed what its future plans are,' New Zealand Defense Minister Judith Collins had said in a separate statement yesterday. Especially now with the disruptive live-firing that was not announced in advance, it is hard not to see the Chinese flotilla's operations as being intended to send a message at least to Australia, if not well beyond. Just five days ago, Australian and Chinese military officials held a high-level strategic dialogue in Beijing, the 23rd such engagement the two countries have held, but the first since 2019. 'At today’s Dialogue, both countries exchanged views on bilateral, global, and regional security issues, as well as military transparency and communication,' Australia's Department of Defense said in a statement after the February 17 gathering. 'Australia reiterated the importance of all countries in the region operating in a safe and professional manner at all times to avoid the risk of miscalculation or escalation.' There has been a general trend of increasingly assertive Chinese naval activity around Australia in recent years. For instance, in 2022, Australian authorities accused a Chinese warship sailing in waters to the north of Australia of harassing one of its P-8A aircraft with a laser. Chinese intelligence-gathering ships have become an increasingly common sight in international waters off Australia coasts, as well. A Royal Australian Air Force P-8A Poseidon. Australian Department of Defense There has been a similar trend in more aggressive Chinese military interactions with foreign warships and aircraft, especially in and around the hotly disputed South China Sea. Just earlier this month, a Chinese fighter jet dropped flares in front of another Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) P-8A flying over the South China China Sea in what officials in Australia described as an 'unsafe and unprofessional interaction.' Chinese state media has since released footage of this incident, as seen below. In a documentary, China released a real footage of PLA J16 intercepting Australian P-8A Poseidon by releasing IR decoy flare. pic.twitter.com/x8h0C9ESZX&mdash; Li Zexin (@XH_Lee23) September 13, 2024 All of this also comes as Australia has been working to modernize and otherwise bolster its naval capabilities with a clear eye toward being better able to challenge China in the Pacific. The most prominent effort in this regard is the Royal Australian Navy's planned acquisition of a nuclear-powered submarine force with the assistance of its American and British allies. This is part of the larger trilateral Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS) defense cooperation agreement. The U.S. military's own forward-deployed air and naval presence in Australia is also set to grow significantly. For its part, China's military has steadily working to expand its ability to project naval and air power further and further away from its shores in all directions in the Pacific, as well as elsewhere globally. This includes a significant uptick in Chinese activity in the waters and skies around the U.S. state of Alaska, which has also often been conducted in direct cooperation with Russian forces. Chinese H-6 missile carrier aircraft notably made their first-ever appearance off Alaska last year as part of a joint patrol with Russian Tu-95 Bear bombers. How long the Chinese flotilla in the Tasman Sea will stay there and whether it will conduct more live-fire drills remain to be seen. The ships have already sent clear signals and their actions so far could be a sign of things to come well beyond this particular deployment.

The caption notes that the X-37B’s seventh mission included, for the first time, a series of aerobraking maneuvers, used to change its orbit using minimal fuel.

U.S. Air Force The seventh X-37B mission, known as OTV-7, launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on December 28, 2023. The X-37B is still in orbit now, having passed 400 days in orbit on January 31 this year. You can find out more about the mission in TWZ’s previous reporting. In general, the Boeing-built X-37B has been incredibly camera-shy. Before the photo published yesterday, and the video clip from 2023, the U.S. Space Force and Boeing only released the first pictures of the service module — including ones showing the U.S. Air Force Academy’s FalconSat-8, a small cubesat, and other payloads loaded onto it — after the conclusion of the OTV-6 mission in 2022.

The montage begins at approximately 3:38 in the runtime: Watch Falcon Heavy launch the USSF-52 mission to orbit SpaceX (@SpaceX) December 29, 2023 Boeing also previously released footage of an X-37B without the service module separating from its launch rocket during the OTV-1 mission, which began on April 22, 2010, and ended on December 3 of that year. This level of secrecy is hardly surprising given that the X-37Bs and their missions remain highly classified. This, in turn, has led to much speculation about their functions, including their potential use as space-based intelligence, reconnaissance, and surveillance (ISR) or weapons platforms. TWZ has discussed what is known about these spaceplanes and their capabilities in depth in the past. As for OTV-7, some details about the mission have gradually emerged, adding to what we already knew about it when it began. The launch, also known as USSF-52, used a Falcon Heavy rocket for the first time, meaning that the X-37B could be placed in a much higher orbit than on previous missions, as TWZ previously explored.

Orbits that take spacecraft beyond the GEO belt — which is defined as being around 22,236 miles (35,786 kilometers) above sea level — are categorized as high-Earth orbits (HEO).

Sedrubal via Wikimedia Commons Furthermore, OTV-7 involves taking the X-37B for the first time on a highly elliptical orbit (confusingly, also known as HEO). In the past, former Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson referred to the X-37B’s ability to operate on a highly elliptical orbit, an egg-shaped trajectory that allows it to maneuver itself once it’s close enough to the atmosphere. The advantage of this is that it allows the spaceplane to reappear unexpectedly in orbit, making it harder for any potential adversaries to track. A video shows a notional trajectory of the X-37B in a highly elliptical orbit: 'We know that that drives them nuts, and I’m really glad about that,' Wilson said, back in 2019. A key aspect of the X-37B is that it is highly maneuverable and the spaceplanes have been observed changing their positions during previous missions. The Space Force had previously said that OTV-7 would include 'experimenting with future space domain awareness technologies, and investigating the radiation effects on materials provided by NASA.' As far as payloads for OTV-7 are concerned, the Space Force has so far only revealed that the X-37B is carrying NASA’s Seeds-2 experiment, which will explore what happens to plant seeds exposed to 'the harsh radiation environment of long-duration spaceflight.' We now know a little more about some of the various aspects of the mission, including that Boeing developed a new collision avoidance system ahead of OTV-7. For the current mission, the Space Force has identified about '1.7 million collision avoidance opportunities,' Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman told Aviation Week in a recent interview, referring to the threat posed by the proliferation of manmade objects in space. Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman, the senior uniformed officer heading the Space Force. U.S. Air Force photo by Andy Morataya The aforementioned aerobraking maneuver is another key aspect of OTV-7. According to Aviation Week, the X-37B vehicle needed some modifications, covering 'fault protection, autonomy, and collision avoidance' to make it capable of this maneuver. This involves the spaceplane using the drag of the atmosphere to dip into low-Earth orbit (LEO), during which it can separate from its service module. You can read more about the aerobraking maneuver in the context of the X-37B in this previous story. The X-37B used for the OTV-6 mission seen ahead of its launch in 2020 with the service module attached to its tail-end. This picture was released in November 2022 after OTV-6’s conclusion. U.S. Space Force Saltzman told the same publication that the aerobraking maneuver was also used to evaluate the Space Force’s Space Surveillance Network, a collection of optical and radar sensors used to detect, track, identify, and catalog all human-made objects in orbit. Finally, OTV-7 has been exploring autonomy, seen as vital as space becomes increasingly busy, especially since spaceplanes like the X-37B operate in various regimes. Saltzman also said in the interview that there were no plans to use the X-37B as an operational vehicle, but it’s clearly being used to gather data that will inform both potential future U.S. spaceplanes and also gain a better understanding of how adversaries could use similar systems. Most notably, China has been busy testing a spaceplane, named Shenlong (meaning Divine Dragon), which is understood to be broadly comparable to the X-37B. Unofficial concept artwork of the Chinese spaceplane, named Shenlong (meaning Divine Dragon). via Chinese Internet Some other details about the X-37B were recently provided to Aviation Week by Boeing’s Michelle Parker, company vice president for space mission systems. She confirmed that the company has been conducting continual upgrades on the X-37B, including introducing new types of batteries and solar cells. 'Even though it may look the same, a lot of the innards have been upgraded and then can continue to fly for a significant amount of time,' Parker told the magazine. While we may still be being drip-fed new information about the X-37B, the fact that more is being disclosed may well reflect calls from U.S. officials and members of Congress to reveal more regarding military activity in and related to space. The X-37B used in OTV-6 sits at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center. U.S. Air Force photo by Staff Sgt. Adam Shank With the X-37Bs now assigned to the Space Force’s main unit tasked with 'orbital warfare,' their military role is now made explicit. Meanwhile, more efforts have also been made to try and communicate to the public about the importance of space to military operations (and daily life) and potential threats outside of the Earth’s atmosphere, as well as what the U.S. government is doing about those issues. Bearing in mind the activities of near-peer adversaries like China or Russia, space is now indisputably a key military domain and potential battlefield in future conflicts. In particular, the ability of China and Russia to threaten U.S. and allied activities in space via various anti-satellite weapons is a growing area of concern. Currently, it’s unclear to what degree the new Trump administration might change how sensitive U.S. military space missions might be communicated to the public. However, the release of a photo showing — for the first time — the Earth seen from an X-37B is certainly a welcome glimpse into the still-secretive world of these hard-working spaceplanes.

New Hypersonic Strike-Recon Aircraft Effort Eyeing Prototype Deve...	The U.S. Air Force, in cooperation with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), is still exploring concepts for a reusable hypersonic air vehicle capable of performing strike and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Work being done now could lead to the start of the development of a flying Next Generation Responsive Strike (Next RS) prototype or demonstrator within the next five years. A secretive Air Force program called Mayhem with very similar stated objectives had become mired in uncertainty last year, including over whether there was even demand for a capability of this kind. The Next RS concept has emerged quietly over the past year or so in multiple DARPA contracting notices seeking proposals to meet various relevant technological needs. Aviation Week was first to report on the effort earlier this month. '[DARPA's] Aerospace Projects Office (APO), working in close partnership with [the] Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), develops and demonstrates technologies which enable Next Generation Responsive Strike (Next RS) air platforms,' one DARPA contracting notice put out on February 5 says. 'APO envisions reusable hypersonic aircraft attributes providing future multi-mission strike/ISR capabilities against targets protected by advanced air defense systems. APO is seeking innovative technologies that close the gap between the state-of-the-art in reusable hypersonics and the level of technical maturity required to initiate a NextRS Y-Plane design and development program later this decade.' A rendering of a notional hypersonic air vehicle. GE The notice lists six technological areas of interest that APO sees as key to advancing the Next RS concept: structures and materials, high-speed weapon separation, dual-mode propulsion, power generation, thermal management systems, and a high-Mach turbine engine. When it comes to dual-mode propulsion, APO is specifically looking at 'technologies that allow continuous powered operation of a Turbine Based Combined Cycle (TBCC) propulsion system over the entire flight envelope.' Advanced high-Mach turbine engine technology will also 'allow efficient TBCC operations through ascending and descending mode transition without the need for water injection.' 'DARPA seeks a better understanding of High Mach Gas Turbine (HMGT) developments to date and what technologies are needed to advance such an engine to the preliminary design level,' a separate Next RS-related contracting notice posted online in April 2024 adds. 'If this engine is going to be developed in the near term, DARPA also believes an existing core is needed as the heart of such an engine development program.' The April 2024 notice, which also highlights DARPA's work already on TBCC propulsion through the past Advanced Full Range Engine (AFRE) program, lays out a notional requirement for an HMGT capable of producing 30,000 to 38,000 pounds of continuous thrust. Other projected performance specifications are classified. A practical TBCC propulsion system has long been viewed as a something of a holy grail for very high-speed aircraft design. Ramjets and scramjets typically used to propel air-breathing air vehicles to hypersonic speeds, typically defined as anything about Mach 5, do not work properly at subsonic speeds and can have trouble operating efficiently even at low-supersonic speeds. As such, a significant initial boost velocity, usually provided by a rocket motor, is required before those engines can kick in. A TBCC combines ramjets/scramjets with jet turbines that work at lower speeds, and offers the ability to seamlessly shift from one mode to the other. An air vehicle with a TBCC propulsion system would be able to take off and land from suitably long existing runways, but cruise at high-supersonic or even hypersonic speeds, offering immense operational flexibility. A graphical depiction of a notional turbine-based combined cycle engine arrangement. Lockheed Martin The explicit mention in DARPA's February 5 contracting notice of 'technologies that allow weapons, weapon bays and ejection systems to accommodate hypersonic separation from aircraft and flyout to the target' is also worth discussing. Any air vehicle flying at hypersonic speed is subjected to immense physical and thermal stresses. Designing a payload bay that can safely open and release something under those conditions presents significant additional challenges. Whatever payload might be released would also be moving at hypersonic speeds, at least initially, and need to be able to withstand those stresses. The development of bespoke munitions would likely be required for an operational Next RS platform. 'The recent development of hypersonic weapons, whether scramjet based or boost-glide based systems, brought with it a resurgence in structural concepts and material development that could survive the hypersonic environment and weapon-like life cycles and timelines,' another contracting notice related to Next RS put out in April 2024 says, adding further context to the substantial materials science and engineering requirements. 'Advances in thermal protection systems, 'hot' structures and additively manufactured structures accompanied these development efforts. Likewise, research in composite materials such as carbon-carbon, infused carbon-carbon or ceramic matrix composites has followed.' 'These structural and material advances for hypersonic weapons are a necessary but not sufficient step towards enabling hypersonic aircraft structures which need to be reusable over larger operational timelines, weight efficient over large surfaces/airframes and primarily designed for thermal loads rather than mechanical loads,' that notice, which expresses interest in 'reusable, weight efficient, thermally driven, metallic airframe and skins,' adds. No further details about the platform or platforms that DARPA and the Air Force might be envisioning for Next RS, including overall size or payload capacity, are provided in any of the contracting notices. As yet, there are no clearly defined requirements that would point to a large aircraft with a big payload. When reached for additional information about the February 5 contracting notice, DARPA told TWZ it could not provide anything else. TWZ has also reached out to AFRL and NASA. Lockheed Martin However, the details about Next RS in hand now are extremely similar to how AFRL previously described the Mayhem program, also referred to as Hypersonic Multi-mission ISR and Strike, and an adjacent effort called Enabling Technologies for High-Speed Operable Systems (ETHOS). Leidos won a contract to develop a scramjet-powered Mayhem air vehicle, which was also expected to be air-launchable from another aircraft, in 2021. Leidos' team also included Calspan, the Draper Laboratory, and Kratos Defense & Security Solutions. However, by the beginning of last year, Mayhem's future had become very murky. 'AFRL is neither terminating the initial task order nor the Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract,' Air Force Col. Aaron Tucker, the High Speed Systems Division Chief at AFRL’s Aerospace Systems Directorate, told TWZ in February 2024. 'The initial task order will be fulfilled with a conceptual design review.' 'The Mayhem program did not receive funding in fiscal year 2024 to proceed beyond the scope of task order 1 (CoDR/SRR),' Tucker added. 'This funding decision results in a year-for-year slip in the development of a digital design and enabling technologies for an air-launched hypersonic ISR [intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance] & strike capability until funds are restored.' Furthermore, 'although AFRL is not terminating the existing contract with Leidos, the operational pull is not clear enough to warrant significant investment to launch and deliver a more complete design package suitable for an acquisition program,' AFRL spokesman Bryan Ripple also told TWZ at that time. 'AFRL may seek to add additional task orders to the Leidos contract in the future.' 'Air Force Global Strike Command [AFGSC] is conducting an Analysis of Alternatives, or AoA, over the next year to refine the requirement for high speed strike and the Office of the Secretary of Defense, or OSD, is continuing to refine leap ahead capability for reuseable applications,' Ripple added. 'What we are more interested in right now, in terms of a feasibility perspective, is a high-mach turbine engine,' a U.S. Air Force official also told TWZ when asked about AFGSC’s interest in Mayhem in February 2024. The current status of Mayhem is unclear and there is a possibility that Next RS is a follow-on or otherwise adjacent to that program. Mayhem, which first emerged back in 2020, has also been tied to another project called the Multi-Mission Cruiser and work on TBCC propulsion systems. The program appearance also followed a still highly curious burst of public discussion around reusable hypersonic aircraft capable of performing strike and ISR missions toward the late 2010s. Central to this was Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works advanced projects division very actively promoting a concept called the SR-72 – a reference to succeeding the company’s famed SR-71 Black Bird spy plane – and related developments. Former company CEO Marillyn Hewson talked openly about potentially building a fighter-sized hypersonic demonstrator for less than $1 billion in 2016. Rob Weiss, then head of Skunk Works, described hypersonic technology as 'mature' at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Aviation Forum the following year and there were reports that an actual flight test of a relevant design could come by 2018. Lockheed Martin's pronouncements even prompted Boeing to subsequently present a competing concept called Valkyrie. An artist’s conception of the proposed SR-72. Lockheed Martin An artist's conception of the proposed SR-72. Lockheed Martin By the end of the 2010s, the SR-72 had disappeared from Lockheed Martin's website and other promotional materials. Talk about the design resurfaced around Skunk Works' creation of a fictional hypersonic aircraft called the Darkstar for the 2022 blockbuster movie Top Gun: Maverick, a design said to be so realistic that parts of it 'could be more than mere fiction.' In 2022, Beoing also released a rendering of a new hypersonic aircraft design, seen below, which looked to have evolved from Valkyrie. The company would not say whether or not it was related to a pitch for Mayhem or work tied to any other U.S. government project. Boeing The Air Force has also publicly worked with various other firms on hypersonic aircraft concepts and related technologies, including with the Hermeus Corporation and Exosonic just in the past few. DARPA and NASA have done extensive research and development related to reusable hypersonic air vehicles over the years, as well. Hermeus has notably been working on a TBCC propulsion system called Chimera. The company is also progressing toward the first flight of its uncrewed Quarterhorse Mk. 1 aircraft, which is powered by a very mundane J85 turbojet engine and is not expected to fly at even supersonic speed. Quarterhorse Mk. 1 is the first of a planned series of designs with progressively more capable propulsion arrangements. We also don't know what else might have been or is still going on in the classified realm in terms of reusable hypersonic aircraft, including with regard to the SR-72 or a similar concept. Running unclassified efforts in parallel with classified ones is not unheard of, and doing so presents benefits, including allowing for the solicitation of proposals to meet certain needs from a wider pool of sources. Whether Next RS reflects work already being done in the classified domain is unknown. Regardless, as TWZ has written in the past about Mayhem: 'Still, a reusable uncrewed air-launched hypersonic strike and reconnaissance aircraft could certainly offer benefits in various operational scenarios. Such a system could be ideal for prosecuting time-sensitive targets, or just gathering intelligence on them, including deep in denied areas at extreme stand-off ranges. From an ISR perspective, spy satellites, which might be the only other option for collecting on the targets in question, could take too long to retask and are predictable, with the enemy knowing when they will pass overhead.' 'An air-launched reusable platform could offer additional flexibility in terms of vector of approach and timely arrival over a target area compared to regional ground and surface-launched concepts.' At the same time, there is a question about whether what a reusable hypersonic aircraft, with all of its complexities, has to offer could be better provided by other capabilities, such as stand-off munitions, including hypersonic types. Whether or not Next RS or any other project leads to an operational reusable hypersonic strike/ISR platform very much remains to be seen. An official Air Force report detailing a vision for that service, as well as the U.S. Space Force, by 2050, which was published in December, notably makes no mention of reusable hypersonic air vehicles, though it does talk about expendable hypersonic weapons. That report did also highlight ever-more serious air defense threats, including anti-air missiles with ranges of up to 1,000 miles, which is in line with the stated drivers behind the Next RS effort. Lockheed Martin Earlier this month, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth also ordered the Air Force to pause a large swath of modernization efforts until a new Air Force Secretary has been confirmed and can review those plans. Hegseth has also issued a memo directing a review of proposed Fiscal Year 2026 spending plans with a goal of shifting roughly eight percent of the entire Department of Defense budget, or approximately $50 billion, to new Trump administration priorities like the Iron Dome missile defense initiative, according to Breaking Defense. The memo, which has not been released publicly, was first reported on by The Washington Post. The Air Force has already been facing an increasingly serious crisis over the affordability of its many modernization priorities. Budgetary concerns, driven in large part by the ballooning costs of the Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) program, notably triggered a deep review last year of plans for a new sixth-generation crewed combat jet being developed under the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative. No decision about the NGAD combat jet's future, which is also intertwined with planning around new Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones and stealth aerial refueling tankers, has been announced so far. All of this has fed into new questions about the optimal size of the future B-21 Raider stealth bomber fleet, as well. A rendering of a notional sixth-generation crewed combat jet. Collins Aerospace What is clear from the emergence of Next RS in the DARPA contracting notice this month is that there remains at least some interest within the Air Force in a reusable hypersonic strike/ISR platform.
