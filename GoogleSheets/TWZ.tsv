Bunker Talk: Let’s Talk About All The Things We Did And Didn’t Co...	Welcome to Bunker Talk. This is a weekend open discussion post for the best commenting crew on the net, in which we can chat about all the stuff that went on this week that we didn’t cover. We can also talk about the stuff we did or whatever else grabs your interest. In other words, it’s an off-topic thread. The caption to this week’s top shot reads: GREAT FALLS, MONTANA, 2014 - Missile combat crew member 2nd Lt. Wesley Griffith prepares to close a three foot thick door inside a launch control center at Malmstrom AFB. Located 70-ft. underground, the control centers were designed and built in the 1960's, during the peak of the Cold War. Malmstrom is home to hundreds of ICBM silos. (Robert Gauthier/Los Angeles Times) Also, a reminder: Prime Directives! If you want to talk politics, do so respectfully and know that there’s always somebody that isn’t going to agree with you. If you have political differences, hash it out respectfully, stick to the facts, and no childish name-calling or personal attacks of any kind. If you can’t handle yourself in that manner, then please, discuss virtually anything else. No drive-by garbage political memes. No conspiracy theory rants. Links to crackpot sites will be axed, too. Trolling and shitposting will not be tolerated. No obsessive behavior about other users. Just don’t interact with folks you don’t like. Do not be a sucker and feed trolls! That’s as much on you as on them. Use the mute button if you don’t like what you see. So unless you have something of quality to say, know how to treat people with respect, understand that everyone isn’t going to subscribe to your exact same worldview, and have come to terms with the reality that there is no perfect solution when it comes to moderation of a community like this, it’s probably best to just move on. Finally, as always, report offenders, please. This doesn’t mean reporting people who don’t share your political views, but we really need your help in this regard. The Bunker is open!

U.S. Army’s First Combat Use Of THAAD Missile Defense System Just...	One of America’s prized Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) batteries fired an interceptor in combat for the first time Thursday. The system, forward-deployed in Israel, was employed against an incoming medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) fired by the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, a U.S. military official told TWZ. The official added that it was unclear as of Friday if the U.S. interceptor or an Israeli one actually took out the missile. A THAAD battery belonging to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) scored the system's first kill overall in 2022, as you can read more about here. Video appeared online purportedly showing the U.S. THAAD interceptor's launch in Israel earlier today. A voice was heard saying he had waited '18 years waiting for this,' a potential reference to the system's age, as the U.S. Army stood up its first THAAD battery in 2008, after it was developed beginning in the early 1990s. מערכת ה- THAAD האמריקנית לקחה חלק ביירוט הטיל הבליסטי ששוגר אמש מתימן. אפשר לשמוע את אחד החיילים האמריקניים מתרגש '18 שנים חיכיתי לזה' pic.twitter.com/s4VoMfMhaF&mdash; איתי בלומנטל Itay Blumental (@ItayBlumental) December 27, 2024 The THAAD battery and about 100 soldiers were deployed to Israel in October to bolster Israel’s defenses ahead of an expected Israeli retaliation for Tehran’s massive missile barrage earlier that month. A counter-attack from Iran never came to fruition, but the battery has stayed in place. Houthi rebels have launched sporadic missile barrages at Israel for months, including while Israel was conducting airstrikes on multiple targets in Yemen during the early hours of Dec. 19.

(Mohammed Hamoud/Getty Images) On Friday, the Yemeni rebel group said it had launched a missile at Israel’s Ben Gurion Airport and also targeted Tel Aviv with a drone attack, all in retaliation for recent Israeli strikes on Sanaa International Airport, the Guardian reported. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the ballistic missile was intercepted before it reached Israeli airspace. Still, residents in central Israel were ordered into shelters for fear of falling debris, the publication noted, adding that there were no reports in Israel of hostile drones over Tel Aviv. The exact configuration of the THAAD battery currently in Israel is unclear, but a unit of this kind can include up to nine transporter-erector-launchers, each carrying eight interceptors, as well as a long-range AN/TPY-2 X-band radar, a mobile fire control and command and control center, and various supporting equipment. Additional interceptors would be available to reload the launchers during a combat deployment, as well. It is a terminal missile defense system, meaning it takes out short-, medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles in the final stages of flight, as they careen down through the atmosphere at their final targeted destinations. A briefing slide showing the general composition of Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) batteries as of 2016. (U.S. Defense Department) For Israel, the THAAD sits at the top end of air defense systems in the country capable of terminal phase missile defense, which also includes David's Sling and the Arrow 2 system. Israel recently retired its Patriot surface-to-air missile batteries, which had terminal missile defense capabilities. The land-based terminal phase intercept capability can be augmented by positioning U.S. Aegis-equipped surface combatants loaded with SM-6 missiles off the Israeli coast. Israel also has a robust mid-course intercept capability in the form of the Arrow 3 system and the same U.S. Navy ships loaded with SM-3s can also provide this capability. The U.S. Army’s seven THAAD batteries have seen multiple short and long-standing deployments in the past. In addition to the one presently in Israel, two more of the units are currently forward-deployed, one in Guam and one in South Korea. While Thursday’s intercept was the first time the U.S. Army had fired the system to defeat an incoming threat, as we noted earlier, the UAE used its THAAD system to bring down a Houthi ballistic missile that was targeting an oil facility near Al Dhafra Air Base, which was hosting U.S. and French forces in addition to Emirati personnel when the attack took place in January 2022. Go here to read TWZ's past reporting on that intercept. A Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) array fires. www.twz.com The deployment this past October was not the first time a THAAD had been sent to Israel, either. The U.S. Army sent the system there in 2019 for an exercise, part of a Pentagon effort to test quickly deploying capabilities, while keeping adversaries from having too much foreknowledge about U.S. military plans, TWZ reported at the time. The U.S. Army has maintained a long-range AN/TPY-2 X-band radar at Site 512, a so-called 'cooperative security location' in Israel’s Negev Desert, since 2012, to bolster Israeli and U.S. missile defenses. The service also started manning a location known as Site 883 in 2017 at Israel’s Bislach Air Base, also in the Negev, seemingly to help streamline the flow of critical data from Site 512, another sign of America’s burgeoning air and missile defense capability in Israel before the current conflict erupted. While Thursday’s intercept marks a THAAD milestone for the U.S. Army, it once again highlights strains in the service’s air defense systems and the soldiers who man them, finite capabilities that are increasingly deployed around the world. TWZ investigated the issue in-depth in 2023, and you can read that coverage here. Demand within the U.S. military for advanced air defense systems, including THAAD, and the interceptors that go with them, has only increased since then. Obligations in the Middle East, including to help defend Israel, as well as in Europe, particularly to Ukraine, have been important driving factors. Growing concerns about Chinese military threats in the Pacific have also prompted new air and missile defense needs. Army Secretary Christine Wormuth acknowledged the stressors being placed on air defense batteries at the time of the THAAD deployment to Israel. Wormuth noted that 'the air defense artillery community is the most stressed,' and said that such units have the highest operational tempo. To mitigate that, Wormuth said the service was trying to modernize its integrated and missile defenses to create more capacity. That in part involves integrating the Patriot battery’s new Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS) into the Army’s Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS) network. Wormuth said that integration would 'greatly increase the capacity of the existing Patriot force that we have, and that will help reduce some of the stress on our soldiers.' Test firing a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) interceptor. (U.S. Army) TWZ has previously broken down what LTAMDS brings to the table: 'LTAMDS is designed to provide higher-fidelity sensing capability at much further distances and process a wider array of data more quickly than the Patriot’s current radar. It can also offer 360-degree coverage, which the current system cannot. The IBCS connects various sensors to effectors like, gun systems, lasers, missile systems, and electronic warfare capabilities and combines all this data on the entire air defense situation into a single actionable ‘picture’ for operators. The combination is meant to give air defenders a much greater ability to better react to and if necessary shoot down a multitude of threats at once.' Still, while this force multiplying new technology will certainly help, physically more missile batteries are also a critical part of the solution, but just how much investment will be poured into doing so remains to be seen. Other Army lines of effort involve being 'as choosy as we can about what we take on,' so as to minimize stress on the force, Wormuth said.

Russian-Linked Oil Tanker Suspected Of Sabotage Was Brimming With...	The Eagle S - a tanker ship carrying Russian oil and suspected of severing the Estlink 2 power cable running under the Baltic Sea between Finland and Estonia - was reportedly brimming with spy equipment. The cable incident is the latest in a series of such events in this strategically important region as tensions with Russia have mounted in the wake of its war on Ukraine. After being seized by Finnish Police, the Eagle S was found to be 'kitted out with special transmitting and receiving devices that were used to monitor naval activity, according to a source with direct involvement in the ship,' Lloyds List reported. That equipment 'effectively allowed it to become a 'spy ship' for Russia.' Russia-linked cable-cutting tanker seized by Finland ‘was loaded with spying equipment’ Michael Weiss (@michaeldweiss) December 27, 2024 'The hi-tech equipment on board was abnormal for a merchant ship and consumed more power from the ship’s generator, leading to repeated blackouts, a source familiar with the vessel who provided commercial maritime services to it as recently as seven months ago,' the publication noted. The 'listening and recording equipment was brought on to the 20-year-old tanker via 'huge portable suitcases' along with 'many laptops' that had keyboards for Turkish and Russian languages when calling at Türkiye and Russia,' Lloyd's List reported. 'The equipment was kept on the bridge or in the 'monkey island,' the uppermost portion of the ship.' 'The transmitting and receiving devices were used to record all radio frequencies, and upon reaching Russia were offloaded for analysis,' the outlet added. 'They were monitoring all NATO naval ships and aircraft. They had all details on them. They were just matching their frequencies.' The equipment was being operated by 'Russians, Turkish, Indian radio officers,' Lloyds List stated. 'Eagle S also dropped 'sensors-type devices' in the English Channel during a transit,' the publication's sources claimed. The War Zone cannot independently verify these claims, however, a shipping industry security source told us that they 'are plausible.' After the Eagle S was seen in the location within the Finnish Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) where the Estlink 2 cable was severed, the Finnish police, in cooperation with other authorities, boarded and seized the 750-foot-long, Cook Island-flagged oil tanker and took it into their territorial waters. Finnish authorities also launched a criminal investigation. The vessel movement of Eagle S is very irregular and corresponds with the location and time of the damage to the Estlink 2 cables. pic.twitter.com/IpEUq13n3k&mdash; Kamsarmax (@cashsarmax) December 25, 2024 'The Helsinki Police Department and the Border Guard have conducted a tactical operation on the vessel,' the Finnish Police said in a statement on Thursday. 'The authorities have taken investigative measures on the vessel, with access there provided by the Finnish Border Guard and the Defence Forces helicopters. The police are also looking into other possible damages in the maritime area.' Finnish investigators believe Eagle S may have caused the damage by dragging its anchor along the seabed, Reuters reported. United Arab Emirates-based Caravella LLCFZ, which owns the vessel according to MarineTraffic data, did not respond to our request for comment. The 658 megawatt (MW) Estlink 2 outage began at midday local time on Wednesday, leaving only the 358 MW Estlink 1 linking Finland and Estonia, the countries' electricity grid operators told Reuters. The following day, officials said that four telecommunications cables connecting Estonia with Finland under the Baltic Sea were also out of service. Fingrid's EstLink 2 transformer station in Anttila in Porvoo (Borga), Finland (Photo by Markku Ulander / Lehtikuva / AFP) / Finland) MARKKU ULANDER Friday morning, Finnish President Alex Stubb said that 'the situation is under control.' 'We have no reason to be concerned,' he added on Twitter. 'We are investigating what happened.' Kokoonnuimme tänään tasavallan presidentin ja ulko- ja turvallisuuspoliittisen ministerivaliokunnan ylimääräiseen yhteiskokoukseen. Käsittelimme Suomenlahden kaapelivaurioita. Kolme viestiäni: 1.

After Estonia experienced power outages following the severing of Estlink 2 on Dec. 25, its officials, along with those from Finland, asked NATO for help protecting the Estlink 1 undersea power cable about 25 miles to the west. On Friday, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte responded by saying the alliance will 'enhance' its presence in the Baltic Sea without offering any details. When asked for specifics by The War Zone, a NATO spokesman declined to 'provide operational details at this time.' Spoke w/ @alexstubb about the ongoing Finnish-led investigation into possible sabotage of undersea cables. I expressed my full solidarity and support. #NATO will enhance its military presence in the Baltic Sea.&mdash; Mark Rutte (@SecGenNATO) December 27, 2024 Meanwhile, the Estonian Navy sent the Raju, a 148-foot-long patrol boat to protect Estlink 1, which runs from Helsinki, Finland to Tallinn, Estonia. 'The Estonian Navy is commencing the protection of the Estlink 1 sea cable with the patrol ship Raju, cooperating with the Finnish Navy and the Supreme Allied Commander Europe of NATO (SACEUR) to secure energy connections between Estonia and Finland,' the Estonian Navy said on Twitter.

Cavoli, the SACUER, told us he is considering a 'serious' response that could involve U.S. assets. 'The Supreme Allied Commander Europe has followed this closely since the beginning,' SACUER spokesman Martin O’Donnell told The War Zone. 'The possible sabotage of undersea cables is a serious matter, and it requires an equally serious and thoughtful response.' Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) 'has options and assets from 32 countries, including the U.S., available to respond,' he added. 'SHAPE, in close coordination with Allied Joint Force Command Brunssum, Allied Maritime Command, and the involved nations are coordinating employment of those options and assets, but I am not in a position to provide further operational details at this time.' A spokesman for the Finnish military declined comment, deferring questions to the Finnish police, who are leading the investigation into the cable rupture. The suspected sabotage of the Estlink 2 power cable is the most recent of several such incidents. In November, Germany said damage to two communication cables running under the Baltic Sea was most likely the result of sabotage. The two cables in question are both fiber-optic communication cables, running along the Baltic seabed. One of these runs between the Swedish island of Gotland and Lithuania, and the other between Finland and Germany. Gotland is about 280 miles southwest of where the Estlink 2 cable was severed. A day later, Denmark confirmed it was monitoring a Chinese cargo vessel at the center of allegations surrounding that damage. The 735-foot-long Yi Peng 3 was identified as operating near the cables when the incidents occurred. The Chinese vessel had departed the Russian port of Ust-Luga, in the Leningrad region, close to the Estonian border, on Nov. 15 and had been scheduled to sail to Port Said, Egypt, where it was originally due to arrive on Dec. 3. Based on publicly available ship-tracking data, the Yi Peng 3 appears to have passed overhead both of the cables around the same time incidents of damage were first reported. The Chinese ship, the bulk carrier Yi Peng 3 is anchored and being monitored by a Danish naval patrol vessel (unseen) in the sea of Kattegat, near the City of Granaa in Jutland, Denmark, on November 20, 2024. (Photo by Mikkel Berg Pedersen / Ritzau Scanpix / AFP) / Denmark OUT MIKKEL BERG PEDERSEN According to the German newspaper Kieler Nachrichten, when the damage to the C-Lion1 cable was confirmed, the Yi Peng 'stopped, drifted, and sailed two circles in the sea area south of Öland for almost 90 minutes.' 'No one believes that the cables were accidentally damaged,' German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said at the time. 'I also don’t want to believe that the ships’ anchors caused the damage by accident. We have to assume, without certain information, that the damage is caused by sabotage.' Two undersea communication cables, one linking Finland to continental Europe via Germany and another linking Lithuania and Sweden's Gotland Island were damaged last month. (Photo by Murat Usubali/Anadolu via Getty Images) Anadolu Other suspicious activities have taken place in the Baltic Sea, including suspected sabotage. Most notoriously, there was a series of explosions along the Nord Stream gas pipelines in 2022. The cause of these is still being investigated by German authorities however The Wall Street Journal reported in August that it was a Ukrainian sabotage operation. Ukrainian officials denied that accusation. Outside of the Baltic, there have been other incidents of reported sabotage of critical communications cables, including one associated with Evenes Air Station, in northern Norway, which happened in April, but was only disclosed in August, as TWZ reported at the time. Norway has seen other suspicious incidents in the past, notably the cutting of a vital undersea cable connecting Svalbard to mainland Norway in 2022. While the Baltic Sea has long been of strategic significance for both Russia and NATO and its allies, there has been a spike in incidents in these waters since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Though no blame has yet been officially assigned for the Estlink 2 cable cut, the fact that a Russian-connected ship packed with surveillance equipment is suspected only adds to the regional tension.

China’s New Domestically Developed Y-20 Airborne Early Warning Je...	Pictures have emerged of what looks to be the first known example of a new Chinese airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft based on the four-engine Y-20 cargo plane. China already has a remarkably large fleet of AEW&C platforms, but most of them are smaller turboprop designs, as TWZ has previously explored in detail. A modern, large, jet-powered type that is based on a locally produced aircraft could succeed or at least augment the small number of existing jet-powered KJ-2000 Mainrings based on the Russian Il-76 Candid airframe. The Y-20 AEW&C aircraft's appearance comes among a number of major Chinese military reveals in the past two days, including the emergence of two previously unseen Chinese advanced combat jets, as well as the official launch of the PLAN's first monster Type 076 amphibious assault ship. pic.twitter.com/kww8ewKZhQ&mdash; OedoSoldier (@OedoSoldier) December 27, 2024 There have been reports for years now that a Y-20-based AEW&C plane, often referred to colloquially as the KJ-3000, has been in the works. The current expectation is that such an aircraft would be based on the up-engined Y-20B variant that first emerged in 2020. Developed by the state-run Xi’an Aircraft Company (XAC), the baseline Y-20A cargo jet first flew in 2013. An aerial refueling tanker variant of the Y-20, known variously as the Y-20U and YY-20B, is also now in service. A picture of an up-engined Y-20B. Chinese Internet A baseline Y-20A. Taiwan Ministry of National Defense The pictures of the apparent KJ-3000 that began circulating online yesterday, offering a limited view of its configuration. It does have a large circular radome on top of the rear end of the fuselage as is commonly seen on many AEW&C aircraft, including the existing Chinese KJ-2000, as well as the Russian A-50 Mainstay (also based on the Il-76) and U.S. E-3 Sentry.

USAF From what is visible now, the new Y-20-based design may have additional large domes on top of the forward fuselage and underneath the tail. The KJ-2000 and the A-50 both have additional domes on top of and below the forward fuselage linked to their extensive communications suites, another critical component of any AEW&C aircraft. The KJ-3000 could have other intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities beyond just its radar, as well. Ok, it goes on and on and on: second surprise this morning, the new KJ-3000 (?) AEW performed its maiden flight at XAC and from what can be seen on the first few small & blurry images, it is as expected a Y-20B-based design featuring a large rotodome but also a bulge on the tail. pic.twitter.com/MTp9A6dfDh&mdash; @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) December 27, 2024 It notably remains to be seen how exactly the KJ-3000's main radome might be configured. Unlike the rotating main radomes on the A-50 and the E-3, the ones on top of China's existing KJ-2000s, as well as its turboprop KJ-500s, are fixed and use three separate active electronically scanned array (AESA) antennas to provide 360-degree coverage. Whatever radar and other mission systems the KJ-3000 might have, for China, just having new AEW&C aircraft leveraging a larger jet-powered airframe would be beneficial. There are only four operational KJ-2000s and it was something of a saga to acquire them in the first place, as you can read more about here. The People's Liberation Army Air Force and Navy (PLAAF and PLAN) have fielded a large number of increasingly capable domestically-developed turboprop AEW&Cs over the years, as you can learn more about in this past TWZ feature. However, a Y-20-based type would offer advantages in terms of speed, range, and on-station time. It would also be able to fly at higher altitudes to provide a better perch for its radar. This is very important, especially for providing ‘look down’ capability to spot and track low-flying aircraft and missiles that radars down below might not be able to 'see' due to terrain and other factors In addition, the KJ-3000's larger crew would be better able to handle longer endurance and more complex missions. If the Chinese were to add aerial refueling capability to the aircraft it would further extend its reach and total mission time. Versions of the turboprop KJ-200 and KJ-500 AEW&C aircraft with aerial refueling probes have been developed. A KJ-500A with an aerial refueling probe. Chinese Internet As a completely locally developed platform, the KJ-3000 would be easier to maintain and sustain, as well as upgrade, compared to the KJ-2000s. The Mainrings are understood to be expensive to operate and are tied to supply chains in Russia. A Y-20-based design could even open a possible path to the export market. China does offer turboprop AEW&C aircraft for sale on the open market and has sold examples to Pakistan. AEW&C aircraft, in general, are important elements of any modern air force. This is especially the case for the PLA, which continues to expand the size and scope of its tactical and strategic aviation fleets. Aircraft like the KJ-3000 help Chinese forces extend and support anti-access and area denial bubbles, including around the mainland, Taiwan, and the hotly contested South China Sea, as well as project power further afield. As TWZ has written in the past: 'The proliferation of Chinese AEW&C aircraft, in particular, points to changing visions of future warfare, including not only defending the People’s Republic but also increasingly projecting power over greater distances, and in a wider variety of regions, including the highly strategic South China Sea. The Chinese military clearly values its AEW&C capability highly, providing them not only with airspace surveillance including a vital look-down capability, but also monitoring the sea, to a lesser degree.' &#8230; 'Having such a large and expanding fleet of AEW&C platforms and their particular characteristics also point to how these aircraft might actually be used in a potential future conflict, perhaps one involving the U.S. military. With this kind of capacity, China should be able to not only cover the approaches to their most strategic areas but also operate from more dispersed and even austere bases. Smaller types, in particular, like the turboprop-powered KJ-200 and KJ-500 series are especially well suited to these kinds of operations and are regular features at China’s island outposts, as well as operating routinely in the highly strategic Taiwan Strait.' 'Production and deliveries of the KJ-500 – the PRC’s [People's Republic of China] most advanced airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft – continued at a rapid pace, joining earlier KJ-2000 Mainring and KJ-200 Moth variants,' according to the Pentagon's most recent annual report on Chinese military developments, which it released earlier this month. 'These aircraft amplify the PLAAF’s ability to detect, track, and target threats in varying conditions, in larger volumes, and at greater distances. It extends the range of the PLA’s IADS [integrated air defense system] network.' A Chinese KJ-200, which has a 'balance beam' style radar array on top of its fuselage rather than a type inside a circular radome. Alert5 via Wikicommons (Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International license) U.S. military officials have also highlighted the significance of Chinese AEW&C developments in the past, especially for controlling more and more capable combat jets armed with ever-longer-ranged air-to-air missiles. 'We notice that they are flying it [the J-20 stealth fighter] pretty well,' Gen. Kenneth Wilsbach, then head of Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), said in 2022. 'We recently had – I wouldn’t call it an engagement – where we got relatively close to the J-20s along with our F-35s in the East China Sea, and we’re relatively impressed with the command and control that was associated with the J-20.' 'Some of their very long-range air-to-air missiles are aided by that KJ-500,' Wilsbach, who is now head of Air Combat Command, added at that time. More certainly remains to be learned about the KJ-3000, but it is a logical addition to the PLA's existing AEW&C fleets that looks set to provide valuable additional capabilities.

China’s Monster Type 076 Amphibious Assault Ship Seen Like Never ...	China has held a launch ceremony for its first super-sized Type 076 amphibious assault ship, now named Sichuan, though the vessel does not look to have gone into the water yet. Imagery from the event does offer the best look at the ship to date, including its twin island configuration, its wide flight deck with a single electromagnetic catapult, its well deck, and its extensive array of close-in defenses. The ceremony at Hudong-Zhonghua Shipyard notably comes just a day after two different previously unseen Chinese advanced combat jet designs broke cover. The ceremony took place today, Friday, December 27, at a dry dock at Hudong-Zhonghua Shipyard on Changxing Island in Shanghai where Sichuan has been under construction since at least October 2023. Hudong-Zhonghua is a subsidiary of the state-owned China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC). 一切为了攻击！ pic.twitter.com/ToEeSJPc0y&mdash; DS北风（风哥） (@WenJian0922) December 27, 2024 祝贺大四川喜提076 pic.twitter.com/jP0BifBKd0&mdash; DS北风（风哥） (@WenJian0922) December 27, 2024 China Type 076 LHD Launch Footage on spot • PLA Navy pic.twitter.com/bLL9HrZOE1&mdash; David Wang (@Nickatgreat1220) December 27, 2024 Official pictures and satellite images from Planet Labs that TWZ reviewed show that the dry dock where the Type 076 is situated, and which it also shares with two other warships under construction, is not flooded. When it might actually enter the water for the first time is unclear. The ceremony is still a significant event and Sichuan, also now known by its hull number 51, certainly looks ready for a true launch. As TWZ has explored in detail in the past, the Type 076 is really unlike any other amphibious assault ship in service or under construction anywhere else in the world at present. A look at the Type 076 during the launch ceremony. Chinese Internet An official statement from the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) says Sichuan will displace around 40,000 tons with a full combat load. Previous analysis by TWZ puts the ship's length at around 864 feet and its width at some 141 feet wide (or 263 and nearly 43 meters, respectively). This all makes the Type 076 substantially larger than China's existing Type 075 amphibious assault ship. The design is also notably wider than other big deck amphibious warfare ships in service globally, such as the U.S. Navy's America class.

There is considerable evidence that drones, including stealthy uncrewed combat air vehicles (UCAV), will make up a substantial part of Sichuan's air wing. Earlier this year, apparent mockups of the GJ-11 Sharp Sword UCAV, or variants or derivatives thereof, appeared at a test and/or training site right on Changxing Island near where the Type 076 has been being built. A pair of apparent GJ-11 mockups at a test and/or training site on Changxing Island in Shanghai in May 2024. Google Earth There remain no indications, at least publicly, that China is pursuing crewed short or vertical takeoff and landing capable tactical jets that would be well suited for operations from a ship like the Type 076. Other lighter crewed types could potentially operate from Sichuan in addition to drones. Helicopters, crewed and uncrewed, will primarily make use of the design's ample deck space, as well. The event today also offers a better view of Sichuan's twin island configuration, another feature optimized for aviation operations. Having two distinct islands allows for one to be dedicated to navigation and other ship operations-related tasks, while the other is focused on flight operations. A drone-heavy air wing presents additional demands when it comes to managing aircraft on the flight deck and in the air, which only increases the value of having a physical structure centered purely on aviation activities. A look at Sichuan's two islands during today's ceremony. Chinese Internet Britain's Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers notably have a twin island arrangement for the same general reasons. India’s future aircraft carrier Vishal may have a similar configuration. Italy's Trieste amphibious warfare ship, a closer analog to the Type 076, also has two islands.

Image by Dave Jenkins via Wikimedia Commons, CC-BY-2.0 However, the imagery from the ceremony also confirms that the Type 076 has a rear well deck for launching and recovering landing craft. It had been unclear whether or not the design would be aviation-centric like the first two examples of the U.S. America class and omit this feature. A view of Sichuan's stern showing the top of the door covering the ship's well deck. Chinese Internet In addition, the new views of Sichuan highlight the ship's substantial close-in defense capabilities, including at least three HQ-10 surface-to-air missile launchers (two at the stern and on one top of the forward island), at least three Type 1130 close-in weapon systems (two on each side of the hull and one at the stern), and what looks to be four 32-tube defensive launchers (two on each side of the hull). The HQ-10 is a rough analog to the launchers for the RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) found on U.S. Navy and other western warships, and is designed to provide the same close-in protection against incoming cruise missiles and other aerial threats, as well as potentially some small surface ones. The Type 1130 is a gun-based system designed to provide another layer of close-in defense with its 30mm Gatling-type cannon. Defensive launchers on Chinese warships can reportedly be loaded with decoy flares, cartridges full of radar-scattering chaff, and active decoys equipped with small radiofrequency jammers, which can be used to confuse seekers on enemy missiles, as well rockets with small depth charges to engage submarines and combat divers.

Chinese Internet This is a significant array of active defenses compared to what is found on many big-deck amphibious assault ships and even some light aircraft carriers. The Type 076's defensive capabilities might also be further bolstered by electronic warfare and electronic support measure systems. Overall, the Type 076 represents a significant new naval capability for the PLAN. As TWZ has written previously: 'The potential value to the PLAN of having a fleet of very large deck amphibious assault ships that are highly capable of large-scale drone operations as well as traditional amphibious assaults is clear. These ships could be used to launch and recover UCAVs like the GJ-11 and other types of drones to perform a host of missions from maritime strike to intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). They could be used to provide additional ‘mass’ in support of the operations of larger carrier strike groups and help to free the air wings of flattops like Fujian up for tasks they might be better suited for. In addition, they could provide a lower tier of naval aviation support that could be employed independently.' &#8230; 'Simply having more naval aviation capacity overall would give the PLAN added flexibility for various operations closer to the mainland, including a potential military intervention against Taiwan or defending its expansive and largely unrecognized territorial claims in places like the South China Sea. Type 076s could also help project naval and air power further from China’s shores, something that has also been a driving factor behind the country’s broader carrier ambitions.' &#8230; 'The Type 076 could help provide support during humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations. Big deck amphibious warfare ships, in general, provide their operators with immensely valuable platforms for projecting both hard and soft power.' Chinese Internet The Pentagon's most recent annual report on Chinese military developments, which it released earlier this month, underscores these assessments. The 'ship will likely use a hybrid electric propulsion system and have electromagnetic catapults (EMALS) for launching large maritime UAVs [uncrewed aerial vehicles] for strike and ISR missions' and will be able to 'provide additional sea control via catapult-launched UAVs,' the report says at various points. The Type 076 further reflects China's substantial shipbuilding capacity and the speed with which it is increasingly capable of producing very large warships. Sichuan underscores broader efforts by China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) to modernize and otherwise expand its capabilities across all domains, as well. Altogether, while the Type 076 still does not look to have been truly launched just yet, that milestone looks increasingly imminent and significant progress clearly continues to be made toward actually delivering the ship to the PLAN.

Yes, China Just Flew Another Tailless Next-Generation Stealth Com...	It appears that another new Chinese combat aircraft has already entered flight testing, and it is also an advanced, stealthy, tailless design. The imagery of the previously unseen aircraft began to circulate on social media today, only a matter of hours after the first appearance of a remarkable diamond-shaped, tailless, heavy tactical combat aircraft design which you can read more about in our initial analysis piece here. A video and several photos of the second, apparently smaller aircraft began to emerge today and, so far at least, they are fewer in number and of inferior quality, making it harder to determine particular details. pic.twitter.com/BKHGVbRIbn&mdash; OedoSoldier (@OedoSoldier) December 26, 2024 Before we continue, it’s important to note that so far this imagery looks remarkably legitimate. That is not to say that it’s verified authentic at this time. There remains the possibility it has been fabricated, but also considering the timing with the other reveal, that seems increasingly unlikely. According to unconfirmed accounts, the second combat aircraft design is from the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation (SAC), while the first, larger design is from the rival Chengdu Aircraft Corporation (CAC). While Shenyang is responsible for the production of Chinese developments of the Flanker multirole fighter family and the medium-weight J-35 stealth fighter family, Chengdu builds the J-10 multirole medium fighter and the heavy J-20 stealth fighter. The second tactical jet aircraft design was shown in some of the photos being ‘chased’ by a Flanker-series fighter, perhaps a two-seat J-16, which would lend further support to the idea that it’s a Shenyang product. A rear-aspect view of the reported Shenyang combat aircraft design. From this angle, a prominent flight-test data probe can be seen on the nose. via X via X While the Chengdu design has a modified diamond-delta wing planform, with extended wing-root ‘chines,’’ the Shenyang aircraft has a relatively sharply swept wing, although this is hardly conventional, being more in line with a ‘lambda’ wing profile. This platform creates prominent triangular-shaped trailing-edge extensions that taper back from roughly the mid-point in the wing, and which project out beyond the engine exhausts. Unlike the apparent new Chengdu design, which is understood to have a three-engine powerplant, the Shenyang design is a more conventional twin-engine aircraft, in keeping also with its smaller size. The engines appear to be fed by what seem to be diverterless supersonic inlet (DSI) intakes on either side of the forward fuselage, below the wing root, and which look to be very angular in shape. The apparent Shenyang combat aircraft design seen from below. via X Two engine nozzles are evident, with some kind of a protuberance between them. From the available angles, it’s not immediately clear if the aircraft has a cockpit. While it would make sense for it to be a part of China’s crewed combat aircraft development path, it could also be a drone or an optionally crewed aircraft. The fuselage is somewhat angular, and deep, suggesting a diamond-shaped cross-section, which would offer a blend of low observability and useful internal capacity for fuel and weapons. Two views of the apparent new Shenyang combat aircraft alongside what looks to be a J-16 chase plane. via X via X The Shenyang design also has a more standard-looking tricycle landing gear, with single wheels on each main unit, while the Chengdu design uses more robust twin-wheel bogies on the main gear to accommodate its larger size and gross weight. Neither of the two designs features any kind of vertical or horizontal tail surfaces. This is entirely in keeping with what we expected of China’s next-generation fighter designs, with tailless concepts having previously appeared in the form of various studies as well as a mysterious tailless vehicle that appeared in satellite images at Chengdu in October 2021. Tailless designs are something we have previously discussed in depth before, in relation to future Chinese fighters, but it’s worth noting that the main advantage they confer is in terms of broadband low observability against a variety of radar types operating across multiple frequencies. At the same time, the radar signature, especially from the side and rear perspectives, will also be reduced significantly. The new ‘heavy’ Chinese combat aircraft alongside a J-20S chase plane. The new design, like the J-20, is thought to be a Chengdu product. via X Two more views of the new ‘heavy’ Chinese combat aircraft, perhaps designated J-36. via X Other advantages of a tailless design include reduced aerodynamic drag, which provides improved performance for sustained high-speed dashes and cruising flight. Additional beneficial factors will almost certainly include a large internal volume for the carriage of fuel and weapons — critical for extended combat radius and persistence on-station, two key concerns in the Asia Pacific theater. At the same time, a tailless configuration can adversely affect overall stability and maneuverability, requiring advanced fly-by-wire digital flight control technology to simply keep it in the air. One feature that could help mitigate stability and maneuverability deficiencies would involve thrust-vectoring engines, something China has tested in the past. Without a good view from the rear, it’s impossible to say for certain, but the nozzles could conceivably feature F-22-style two-dimensional thrust-vectoring. Unconfirmed reports suggest that the Shenyang design is a prototype fighter and made its first flight on December 20 this year. Another view of the apparent Shenyang combat aircraft design from below. Test flights performed over populated areas suggest no great desire to hide the aircraft from prying eyes. via X However, it seems that Beijing very deliberately ensured that the two new designs broke cover today, for maximum impact. This would make sense given that December 26 is the birthdate of Mao Zedong, the founder of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). It is also exactly 13 years to the day that the J-20 first broke cover. At this point, it’s worth noting that in both cases, we cannot currently confirm the identities of the manufacturers or even the intended roles of the new aircraft. So far, there have been no official comments from the Chinese government or industry, although internal security services certainly appear to have let imagery be leaked via unofficial channels and it’s also notable that these test flights were documented in the daytime. As we have discussed before, the design now thought to be from Chengdu is notably large, suggesting that it could possibly be related to the so-called JH-XX. This is described by U.S. intelligence officials as a regional bomber, with a shorter range, smaller payload capacity, and more of tactical focus than the H-20 stealth bomber. The H-20 is being developed by the Xi’an Aircraft Corporation (XAC) and is widely expected to be a flying-wing type aircraft, like the B-2 and B-21. The JH-XX remains a very shadowy project, but you can read more about what is known here. A picture that has previously emerged showing a model of a design that might be tied to work on the JH-XX. Chinese Internet In the past, we have also suggested that the JH-XX ‘bomber’ could finally emerge as something closer to a ‘fighter-bomber’: 'The design could prioritize speed, as well as stealth, too. This could give the smaller fighter-bomber added advantages when it comes to sortie rates and for successfully penetrating through an enemy’s integrated air defense network. Above all else, it allows for multi-role operations, including supporting long-range air-to-air missions, without a heavy reliance on vulnerable tankers or even the use of coastal airfields, which would be the most vulnerable to attack during an all-out conflict.' While the new three-engine design could be related to the JH-XX, it could also be a more generic demonstrator intended to test a variety of combat aircraft technologies. It could also be a more heavyweight fighter being developed under China’s next-generation airpower initiative. Speaking to TWZ, Chinese aerospace observer and author Andreas Rupprecht explained that his assessment is that we are seeing combat aircraft demonstrators from Shenyang and Chengdu and that these are both closer aligned to fighters rather than bombers. 'Using the sixth-generation description is perhaps a little too hasty, but I think we are at the point where we can really say the Chinese have shown us for the first time their idea of air combat and new-generation fighters,' Rupprecht said. Certainly, China now appears to be flying two different very advanced combat aircraft designs, which could also be rivals, with one being smaller than its competitor, which would have certain advantages in terms of cost, complexity, and performance. They could also be intended to complement one another as a ‘medium/heavy’ future manned fighter combat mix. This latter would parallel China’s pursuit of the single-engine J-10 and the twin-engine J-11/16 series, followed by the co-development of the medium-weight J-35 and the larger J-20 stealth fighters. At one stage, it looked like the J-35 would be primarily aimed at export customers, as well as for Chinese naval use, but a Chinese land-based version is now also known to be in development.

Photo by Wang Jingtian/VCG via Getty Images A Shenyang J-35 stealth fighter. Chinese Internet Chinese Internet What we do know is that China has an active sixth-generation fighter program. It would not be surprising for more than one flying demonstrator design to be built to support it, or even prototypes much closer to planned production aircraft. Whether China plans to introduce more than one sixth-generation fighter, or simply determine what kind of design best suits its needs, there are plenty of signs that the country is fully committed to a future air combat program, which will include a crewed fighter as well as complementary drones, and also the JH-XX, which may well be being developed as part of the same ‘ecosystem,’ perhaps even sharing certain subsystems and technologies. The H-20 could also form part of this same broader airpower architecture. The previous boss of Air Combat Command, Gen. Mark D. Kelly, spoke in September 2022 about China’s future fighter program, noting that it was likely to follow a ‘system of systems’ approach similar to the one that the U.S. Air Force has been pursuing and would certainly include a sixth-generation crewed fighter. Gen. Kelly also said he expected the platform — or platforms — to emerge with an 'exponential' improvement in stealth compared with current Chinese aircraft. Of course, a tailless design could help achieve this. An artist’s impression of a generic U.S. Air Force tailless sixth-generation crewed fighter, of the kind being developed under the NGAD initiative. Collins Aerospace Collins Aerospace Notably, the U.S. military’s latest annual report to Congress on Chinese military developments, an unclassified version of which was released on December 18, doesn’t mention potential sixth-generation crewed fighter developments. Chinese officials, meanwhile, have given very little away about the country’s future tactical air combat program. However, in a 2019 interview, Wang Haifeng, chief designer for CAC, described a project that aimed for service entry around 2035. That would also seem to be broadly in keeping with the first flight of a Chengdu demonstrator around now. In the past, Andreas Rupprecht told TWZ that: 'Allegedly, since 2018, CAC and its related 611 Institute have been working on the development of key technologies for the next-generation fighter.' As well as testing for future crewed combat aircraft, China is already heavily engaged in developing various supporting technologies. These include the ability for future crewed combat jets to team with drones, and the use of artificial intelligence, as well as advanced sensors and weapons that will be brought together as part of China’s broader future air combat architecture. While the appearance of one new-generation Chinese combat aircraft design is notable, the apparent emergence of two different such designs in a single day would truly be a milestone. Today’s developments should also be seen in light of the U.S. Air Force’s equivalent Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative, which includes its crewed sixth-generation stealth combat jet. A final decision on this has now been pushed to the incoming Trump administration, amid uncertainty about the Air Force’s ability to pay for NGAD. At the same time, questions have been increasingly asked about the relevance of NGAD in a future high-end combat scenario. A rendering of a notional U.S. tailless sixth-generation crewed fighter, refueling in flight. Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin It will be some time before we get a better understanding of the precise roles and attributes of China’s new combat aircraft designs. However, the country is clearly already committed to developing successors to its current combat aircraft fleet and appears to be looking at how best to achieve significant advances in terms of range, payload, speed, and low observability. While it’s still unclear what China’s next-generation fighter or fighters will end up looking like, and how they might be related to the JH-XX ‘fighter-bomber,’ the current pace of development puts the uncertainty around the U.S. Air Force’s NGAD efforts into even sharper focus.

Anti-Drone Weapon With 24 Barrels Firing Buckshot-Like Rounds Eme...	Russian forces have begun using improvised counter-drone buggies each armed with a weapon made up of 24 barrels that fire shotgun-like ammunition, as well as six AK-series infantry rifles on a single mount. The cluster of shot-firing barrels highlights how shotguns have become a go-to option for both sides of the conflict in Ukraine to help provide local defense against uncrewed aerial threats, but also the limitations of those weapons in this role. A video from the Russian Ministry of Defense, seen below, shows a pair of the new counter-drone vehicles. An accompanying official post on the Telegram social media network says they are based around a chassis taken from an unspecified model of the long-popular 4&#215;4 Lada Niva series.

Ukrainian soldiers test the effects of shotgun cartridges on attacking FPV drones.Apparently knocking down an FPV with a shotgun is a challenge. pic.twitter.com/UIa4jbigNb&mdash; Roy (@GrandpaRoy2) December 12, 2024 'A shotgun does not penetrate, does not damage the FPV drone,' a Ukrainian service member says at one point in the video. 'He hit the antenna [on the drone], but it didn't stop him anyway,' another individual says in the clip. Firing a burst of shotgun shells at once from a cluster of barrels could help maximize total damage to the target, as well as increase the overall likelihood of scoring hits. However, the effective range of typical buckshot shotgun ammunition, as well as its penetrative capabilities at longer distances, has long been a limiting factor in the battlefield use of shotguns broadly speaking. As a prime example of this, the U.S. military's abortive late Cold War-era Close Assault Weapon System (CAWS) combat shotgun program notably also involved the development of new ammunition types to try to provide better terminal effects at extended ranges. The War Zone more recently highlighted exactly these issues after the U.S. Marine Corps expressed interest earlier this year in the possibility of acquiring shotgun pellet-like ammunition for its standard service rifles to help defend against drones. New specialized ammunition could still be a way to improve the utility of shotguns and other small arms against drones. Pictures of the shotgun that German gunmaker Heckler &#038; Koch developed in cooperation with the Olin Corporation in the United States for the U.S. military's CAWS program (at left) and special metal-cased buckshot rounds that went with (at right). Heckler &#038; Koch At the same time, engaging small and highly maneuverable drones like FPV kamikaze types with small arms can be a tall order, in general. The U.S. military, among others, has been fielding computerized gun sights on a limited level to help individual shooters better engage uncrewed aerial threats. The Marine Corps has also at least tested another counter-drone system for existing standard infantry rifles that includes an automatically moving buttstock, as you can read more about here. Still, at least when it comes to the U.S. Army, 'kinetic defeat' capabilities involving an 'augmented primary weapon optic&#8230; are considered [a] last line of defense for a squad-sized element,' according to a recent contracting notice.

USMC When it comes to the 24-barrel weapon on the new Russian counter-drone vehicles, there is also a question of how quickly and easily that system can be reloaded after firing. It is important to stress that multiple layers of capabilities would offer the best defense against drones, even just localized attacks by smaller kamikaze types. What the optimal mix of anti-drone systems might be remains a hot topic of debate globally. Options that incorporate guns do look set to be part of that ecosystem for the foreseeable future. Shotguns and other weapons that fire similar pellet-filled ammunition, like the one that has now emerged on the Russian counter-drone buggies, are still very much in the mix when it comes to protecting against uncrewed aerial threats despite questions about their overall utility.

What We Know About the Azerbaijan Airliner That Crashed In Kazakh...	Azerbaijan Airlines Flight JS-8432 crashed in Kazakhstan Wednesday after being fired upon by a Russian Pantsir S1 short-range air defense system, the head of Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR) told The War Zone, while a U.S. official told us that a Russian anti-aircraft system may have struck the aircraft. These claims line up with video emerging from inside the jet and the crash scene as well as reporting by several news outlets indicating the Russian air defense system caused the crash of the Embraer 190 passenger jet that killed 38. The War Zone cannot independently verify these claims while several investigations are underway and Russian, Azerbainanian and Kazakh officials urge restraint in reaching conclusions about the crash. Video taken by a passenger before the crash reportedly showed 'shrapnel holes in the fuselage, consistent with damage from a Russian surface-to-air missile,' according to the Twitter account of the Azeri Times news outlet. 'The footage also shows a woman bleeding from her leg, wounded by shrapnel.'

Euronews, citing 'Azerbaijani government sources' reported that 'a Russian surface-to-air missile caused the Azerbaijan Airlines plane crash in Aktau on Wednesday.' 'According to the sources, the missile was fired at Flight 8432 during drone air activity above Grozny, and the shrapnel hit the passengers and cabin crew as it exploded next to the aircraft mid-flight,' the publication reported. 'Government sources have told Euronews that the damaged aircraft was not allowed to land at any Russian airports despite the pilots’ requests for an emergency landing, and it was ordered to fly across the Caspian Sea towards Aktau in Kazakhstan. According to data, the plane’s GPS navigation systems were jammed throughout the flight path above the sea.' Aktau is nearly 300 miles east of Grozny. The stricken jet flew nearly 300 miles east, including nearly 190 miles over the Caspian Sea. (Google Earth) The airliner, with 67 people on board, was due to fly to Grozny in Russia's Chechen Republic but it was diverted because of fog, the airline said, according to the BBC. 'A surviving passenger told Russian TV he believed the pilot had tried twice to land in dense fog over Grozny before 'the third time, something exploded&#8230; some of the aircraft skin had blown out,'' the network reported.

'The Russian dispatcher said that the aircraft was experiencing a failure in its control systems and that the crew decided to fly to Aktau after receiving reports of bad weather, Karabayev said,' according to CNN. 'The dispatcher later said that an 'oxygen tank exploded in the passenger cabin, causing passengers to lose consciousness,' according to Karabayev. While the Azerbaijan Airlines crew made two landing approaches at Aktau airport, the aircraft deviated from its course, and lost communication with Aktau dispatchers when it crashed, Karabayev said.' The flight-tracking website Flightradar24 reported that the plane set off on Wednesday at 7:55 a.m. Azerbaijan Standard Time (AST) and crashed at 10:28 a.m. AST. 'The aircraft was exposed to strong GPS jamming which made the aircraft transmit bad ADS-B data. At (8:40 a.m. AST) we lost the ADS-B signal,' Flightradar24 concluded.

After reportedly being damaged by the Russian SAM, the jet's communications systems were 'completely paralyzed' by Russian electronic warfare systems, according to Caliber. 'This disruption caused the aircraft to disappear from radar within Russian airspace and only reappeared in the area of the Caspian Sea.' Caliber added that according to Russian sources, 'at the time of the flight over Chechnya, Russian air defense systems were attempting to shoot down Ukrainian drones. The head of the Security Council of the Chechen Republic, Khamzat Kadyrov, confirmed the drone attack on Grozny on the morning of December 25, stating that there were no casualties or damage. In this case, the Russian side should have closed its airspace to civilian aircraft, but this was not done. Why a no-fly zone was not declared over Chechnya remains a significant question.' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned against jumping to conclusions that the Russians fired at the jet. 'It would be wrong to put forward any hypotheses before the investigation's conclusions,' he argued. 'We, of course, will not do this, and no one should do this. We need to wait until the investigation is completed.' A regional Kazakh official appeared to acknowledge Thursday that the investigation is looking into whether Russian air defenses downed the plane but said it is too soon to offer a definitive assessment. Mangystau Regional Transport Prosecutor Abylaibek Ordabayev said they have not yet come to any conclusions about whether that played a role, Reuters reported. Azerbaijanian President Ilham Aliyev said he learned of the crash while he was flying to Russia to attend the informal summit of the heads of state of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) member countries in St. Petersburg on Dec. 25. He promptly ordered his plane to return to Baku and ordered a criminal investigation of the crash. Like the Russians and Kazakhs, he urged caution before determining the cause. 'The commission's task is to fully investigate the matter, examine the causes of the crash and all its details, and provide information both to me and to the Azerbaijani public,' he said. 'According to the information provided to me, the AZAL airline plane, flying on the Baku-Grozny route, changed its course due to worsening weather conditions and began heading toward Aktau airport, where the crash occurred during landing. There are videos of the plane crash available in the media and on social networks, and everyone can watch them. However, the reasons for the crash are not yet known to us. There are various theories, but I believe it is premature to discuss them. The matter must be thoroughly investigated. A criminal case has been launched by the Prosecutor General's Office, and naturally, the Azerbaijani public will be regularly informed about both the results of the commission's work and the progress of the criminal case.' That anyone survived the crash at all is amazing in itself. It speaks volumes about the pilots' ability to fly the stricken jet for nearly 300 miles, including nearly 190 miles over a large body of water, reportedly with disrupted communications and likely by using thrust to help the flight because the left horizontal stabilizer was reportedly rendered inoperable by the shrapnel. Captain Igor Kshnyakin, co-pilot Aleksandr Kalyaninov and purser Hokuma Aliyeva were killed in the crash, according to Euronews, while the other two flight attendants, Zulfugar Asadov and Aidan Rahimli, reportedly survived and were being treated in hospital on Thursday. The crew was hailed as heroes for their ability to maintain flight and keep the passengers relatively calm. Kshnyakin and Kalyaninov 'displayed remarkable airmanship, according to experts, as they managed to fly the stricken plane across the Caspian Sea and crash landing just 3 kilometers short of the Aktau airport runway,' Euronews noted. In a Tweet, the airline provided a list of the crew and passengers on the aircraft.

In September 2016, a Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team tasked with figuring out what happened to Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) on July 17th, 2014 concluded that a SA-11 Buk surface-to-air missile system downed the hapless airliner, and that weapon was sent into Ukraine from Russia and removed shortly after the engagement. The site where the missile was fired has also been officially pinpointed as just outside the village of Pervomaiskyi, which was held by pro-Russian forces at the time. After the shootdown, in which all 298 lives aboard MH17 were lost, the Buk system was quickly moved back into Russian territory the next day, according to the report 'After the BUK missile had been fired, the BUK-TELAR initially drove off under its own power,' the report concluded. 'A short time later it was reloaded onto the Volvo truck and transported back to the Russian border. During the night, the convoy crossed the border into the territory of the Russian Federation.' There have been several relatively recent cases where air defenses, under pressure of an ongoing or possibly impending attack, have taken down the wrong aircraft. Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752, a Boeing 737-800, crashed shortly after taking off from Tehran Imam Khomeini International Airport at approximately 6:12 AM local time on Jan. 8, 2020 after being struck by two Iranian air defense missiles. The flight was heading to the Ukrainian capital Kyiv and had 176 crew and passengers on board, all of whom died in the subsequent crash. Video footage that subsequently emerged showed the plane engulfed in a fireball before it hit the ground. The shootdown immediately followed an unprecedented Iranian missile strike targeting U.S. forces in Iraq and Iranian air defenses were on extreme alert anticipating the country would be hit in retaliation. You can read more about that here. Rescue workers carry the body of a victim of a Ukrainian plane crash. On January 8th, 2020 Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 was scheduled to depart from Tehran to Canada via Kyiv. The Boeing 737-800 was shot down shortly after taking off from Imam Khomeini International Airport by two missiles fired by the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). All 176 passengers and crew were perished. (Photo by Javad / Middle East Images / Middle East Images via AFP) JAVAD More recently, a U.S. Navy F/A-18F Super Hornet was accidentally shot down by a missile fired by the U.S. Navy Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Gettysburg over the Red Sea. The jet, downed early on December 22 local time, was returning to the aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman during the middle of what a U.S. official told The War Zone was a complex attack. 'After successfully returning from its initial mission, an F/A-18F launched again to provide air defense support from OWAs and ASCMs that were inbound to the force,' a U.S. official told us. 'They were shot down while recovery of remaining aircraft was underway.' According to Fox News, a second Super Hornet narrowly avoided being struck by a missile from the Gettysburg. It may take a while before a definitive conclusion can be reached about what happened to Azerbaijan Airlines Flight JS-8432. However, preliminary reports seem to indicate that once again, neither anti-aircraft systems nor the people operating them, are infallible in the heat of battle.

China Stuns With Heavy Stealth Tactical Jet’s Sudden Appearance	In something of a stunning development, China appears to already be flying a stealthy, high-performance, flying-wing, sixth-generation crewed combat aircraft, imagery of which began to emerge today. At this early stage, we have very little idea about the precise identity of the new aircraft, but many elements of its design are very much in line with what we already knew about Chinese sixth-generation airpower aspirations. pic.twitter.com/IZ9BlwjoOc&mdash; Justin Bronk (@Justin_Br0nk) December 26, 2024 第三圈 pic.twitter.com/GvKReHJ3sm&mdash; 東風 (@eastwind6699) December 26, 2024 Video and photos that began to circulate today on social media show the previously unseen aircraft conducting a daytime test flight, alongside a two-seat Chengdu J-20S fighter, serving as a chase plane. The locations and the dates of the various imagery cannot be verified at this stage, although the presence of the J-20 suggests that the Chengdu Aircraft Corporation (CAC) factory airfield is a likely candidate. The new Chinese combat aircraft accompanied by a J-20S chase plane. via X via X There has also been no official comment from the Chinese Ministry of Defense or state media so far. Aside from the sheer size of the new aircraft, which we will address in a moment, the most striking thing about it is its planform and tailless configuration. It has a modified delta wing with chine lines emanating all the way to the nose area, while its central fuselage section, at least the bottom of it, is loosely reminiscent of the J-20. The broad nose could even provide space for side-by-side crew seating, although the limited views of the canopy mean we cannot be sure whether the aircraft has a single-seat or two-seat arrangement, with tandem twin seats being another option. via X via X via X There was already growing evidence pointing to the fact that China’s next fighter would be tailless, and designs of this kind had previously appeared in the form of technical studies. Back in October 2021, a mysterious tailless aircraft shape appeared in satellite images of a CAC factory airfield. It was a large modified-diamond-like delta planform with a relatively thin nose section; it also had a significant wingspan — broadly similar to that of a J-20. But it's worth noting that this shape does not look the same as the aircraft we are seeing. Beyond that, next-generation tactical combat aircraft eschewing traditional tails is a major design driver being pursued by the U.S., as well. This is predominantly to significantly reduce the aircraft's radar signature across multiple bands and from all aspects. There are some aerodynamic efficiencies also to be had with such a design, especially one used for long-range operations via a reduction in aerodynamic drag, which should provide better performance for sustained high-speed dashes and cruising flight. At the same time, a tailless configuration can adversely affect overall maneuverability, even with the most advanced computerized flight control systems. There are currently no signs of thrust-vectoring engines on this aircraft, which would help enhance agility and overall stability. The engine exhausts are mounted in the best place to mask the aircraft's infrared signature, atop the rear of its fuselage.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION While a tailless configuration, size, general shaping, and exhaust layout point directly toward a design tailored for stealth and endurance, it’s not entirely clear the exact level of enhanced low observability this new aircraft might offer. But just deleting the tail surfaces and strakes and providing a more general aerodynamic clean-up, while leveraging the same now nearly 15-year-old technology found on the the J-20, for example, would still be a massive improvement. Clearly, this aircraft incorporates significantly greater low observable technologies that are a leap ahead of the J-20, beyond its tailless design. Also notable is the elaborate arrangement of control surfaces coupled with the tailless design, with five trailing edge control surfaces per wing. These include prominent split flaps close to the wingtips. These would be used differentially to provide yaw control in the absence of tail control surfaces, as well as deploying simultaneously to serve as air brakes. via X In terms of size, the new aircraft can be compared to the J-20 — the imagery suggests it is at least as long. The J-20 is close to 70 feet from nose to tail. In this regard, this design's twin-wheel main landing gear is also worth noting, providing another pointer to the considerable weight of the aircraft. Above all, its large size would seem to reflect an overarching concern with long endurance with comparatively massive internal volume to accommodate a very large fuel load, as well as weapons and sensors.

Photo by Wang Jingtian/VCG via Getty Images Maybe the aircraft's most unusual feature is its air intake arrangement. It appears to have an air intake on top of the fuselage, as well as twin intakes on either side of the lower fuselage. This has already led to speculation that the aircraft may have a highly unorthodox three-engine arrangement. Unconfirmed rumors point to a powerplant comprising three domestically produced WS-10C turbofans, as used in the J-20. Considering the aircraft's higher gross weight than the J-20, three engines may be necessary in order to meet aggressive performance goals, especially for sustained high-speed flight and operations at high altitudes. Three it is. pic.twitter.com/3nSa3hFWeM&mdash; Mike Pryce (@MichaelJPryce) December 26, 2024 That China has been working on a sixth-generation combat aircraft program is also no surprise. Back in September 2022, Gen. Mark D. Kelly, who was then the head of Air Combat Command (ACC), said that China was working on the same kind of air combat ‘system of systems’ that the U.S. Air Force is pursuing under its Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative, including a sixth-generation manned fighter jet. At the time, Kelly noted that China saw sixth-generation air power, including future manned fighter aircraft, 'greatly the way we see it: an exponential reduction in signature, exponential acceleration of processing power and sensing.' Another key factor would be the ability to 'iterate' improvements aided by open mission systems, Kelly added. via X via X Regarding a potential successor to the J-20, Gen. Kelly warned that China 'are not dummies. They know what they’re doing.' Kelly also said he expected the Chinese sixth-generation air combat program to include an 'exponential' improvement in stealth compared with current platforms. At this early stage, it’s far from clear whether the new aircraft is a prototype sixth-generation fighter, or perhaps a more generalized demonstrator that will test new technologies that could potentially end up on a variety of different platforms, including a large tactical aircraft much like it. It seems almost certain that China, for some time now, has been engaged in preliminary testing of different manned fighter configurations. This development work may also include demonstrators, both sub-scale and full-size, and the new aircraft may well be related to it. via X The aircraft could also be related to a new regional stealth bomber aircraft, which could potentially be a crewed component tied to the broader Chinese sixth-generation airpower initiative. The regional bomber program, known as JH-XX, remains very secretive, but you can read more about what is known about that project here. Previously, it was thought that the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation might be working on the JH-XX, in which case a J-20 chase plane, from the rival Chengdu, would seem less likely. But more likely, at least at this time, this aircraft could be more closely tied to China's version of America's Next Generation Air Dominance initiative, which aimed to develop a similar manned heavy 'fighter'-like aircraft that would work just as much as a command and control node for drones as a classic fighter. Range, sustained speed in cruise, weapons payload, and low observability are all thought to be top priorities of the manned fighter component of NGAD, or at least were. The fighter element of the program is now on hold and still may be canceled entirely, or end up looking very different, under the Trump administration. The fact that this exotic aircraft was flying during the day, in an area where it was seemingly easily photographed also tells a lot about the program's status. It is very likely China intended for this to be seen at this time. Overall, while so much remains unknown, what we can say about this aircraft definitively is that it's a large, very heavy, tactical jet that has had a massive premium put on combat radios and survivability. High altitude operations are also likely a feature of this design, especially if it does indeed feature three engines. But above all else, it should be able to fly over long regional distances and loiter for extended periods on station far from home without tanker support — something China lacks in terms of capacity versus the United States. In other words, it can put targets in the air, on the ground, and at sea at risk in areas where they won't expect a threat from a manned combat aircraft, at least based on China's current inventory. This has real implications for American tankers, airlifters, and reconnaissance aircraft, as well as allied ships and forces operating at forward locales. It would serve as a critical force-multiplying sensor platform operating far forward. Paired with drone wingmen of relevant endurance, its lethality and survivability would be multiplied. In other words, the existence of this aircraft is a very big deal.

U.S. Navy Ship Menus From Christmases Past	Man, is it just me or did Christmas sneak up FAST this year? Is that just a function of getting older? Remember the anticipation as a kid, the countdown that began right after Halloween? Alas, so it goes. Either way, another Christmas is once again upon us. We are grateful to have you all along for the ride. And no matter what’s going on in your life, we hope you enjoy a day of rest and rejuvenation, far away from the demands of the other 364 days of the year. So let’s celebrate with some choice dinner menus from Navy ships during yules past. We’ve even got a longtime TWZ reader chipping in with a menu (thanks, Sean!) Thanks as well to the U.S. Naval Historical and Heritage Command for assembling these culinary time capsules. Merry Christmas and happy holidays. Please stay fed. USS Oregon (BB-3) 1917 Aren't all olives we eat technically ripe? (U.S. Navy) The ship: The Indiana class battleship was commissioned in 1898 and found adventure on the high seas before being decommissioned in 1920. 'Oregon made a dramatic voyage during the Spanish-American war, weathering storms, while encountering harsh gales while passing through the Straits of Magellan, arriving 66 days after she departed,' a Navy history recounts. 'This journey gave evidence for building the Panama Canal as it would be prudent for the United States not to wait again for this transit if emergencies arose.' The good: Potato croquettes are a criminally underrated Potato Delivery Vehicle (PDV), and lemon meringue pie really deserves more of the pie spotlight. The not so good: 'Cluster raisins' sounds like when you open a box of raisins and they’re all stuck together. USS Monterey (BM-6) 1918 That's a tasty menu. (U.S. Navy) The ship: The only ship of its class, Monterey was commissioned in 1893 and soon took on missions that were bigger than what the monitor platform (it literally looks like a platform too!) was envisioned for. 'Though not designed for extended ocean cruising, the big monitor departed San Diego 11 June in company with collier Brutus for Manila,' a Navy history states. 'Sailing via Honolulu and Apra, Guam, the two ships made the 8,000‑mile voyage without mishap, arriving 13 August, and Monterey remained in the Philippines supporting the occupation of Luzon into 1899.' The good: Buttered asparagus tips and grape juice punch. I wonder what grape juice punch tasted like in the days before artificial flavoring. The not so good: Seaman Timmy appears to have typo’d up this menu. If not, the mess should have gone to mast for serving roast turkey with tartar sauce and baked red snapper with giblet gravy. USS Colorado (BB-45) 1926 Scary Santa. (U.S. Navy) The ship: A grand old dame of the fleet by the time World War II broke out, a Navy history nonetheless notes how Colorado did her part: 'In November 1943, Colorado took part in the Tarawa invasion. She supported the landings at Kwajalein and Eniwetok in January and February 1944 and the Marianas operation in June and July. On 24 July 1944, while bombarding Tinian, she was hit by enemy shore batteries, suffering serious casualties among exposed personnel topside.' 'Colorado's next combat duty was off Leyte in November 1944, where she was hit by two ‘Kamikaze’ suicide planes late in the month. Remaining in the combat zone, she supported the Mindoro invasion in December and the Lingayen Gulf landings in January. During March, April and May 1945, Colorado's sixteen-inch guns bombarded Okinawa in support of U.S. troops ashore. In August and September 1945, she covered the occupation of Japan, then departed for the United States.' The good: Pickled eggs are lowkey the best bar/drinking food out there, and cold pork or ham is pure Christmas. The not so good: The menu cover is kind of terrifying, and those two tykes do not look excited to see Ol’ Saint Nick. USS Bridge (AF-1) 1936 Eating good on USS Bridge. The ship: A humble provisions stores ship that helped keep troops supplied during the invasion of Okinawa in 1945. The good: Cauliflower a la parmesan seems ahead of its time, despite the fact that cauliflower is timelessly adaptable and delicious. Also the most aesthetically pleasing menu cover in our collection. The not so good: We discussed this before, but saltines have no right to be a featured player on any holiday menu. USS Lawrence C. Taylor (DE-415) 1945 Reader Sean's Christmas menu that his uncle and family kept for nearly 80 years. The ship (and the contributor): You already know that TWZ has the best readers out there, and that our comments section is without peer. So we’re pleased to share this next entry, submitted by longtime reader Sean, whose uncle served on this John C. Butler class destroyer escort during World War II. It has been passed down by his family through the decades and we are proud to now render it online immortality. 'Menu came from my family member Howard Eiss, who was the sailor on the ship,' Sean told TWZ. 'To the best of my knowledge, this was passed down in the family and I came about it only a few years ago.' The good: Sean keeping this priceless piece of family history for years to come; old-fashioned fruit cake. The not so good: Celery en Branch sounds like the mess got a tad lazy. Still, the ship and its crew had fought hard throughout the Pacific during the war, and had earned this feast by Xmas ‘45. Merry Christmas, everyone!

New Coast Guard Heavy Icebreaker Construction Finally Underway	The construction of the first Polar Security Cutter (PSC) heavy icebreaker for the U.S. Coast Guard is now formally proceeding. Though the milestone is important, it also underscores the PSC program's already massive delays. The first of these new icebreakers was originally supposed to have been delivered this year and may not now arrive until 2029. The Coast Guard is sorely in need of more heavy icebreakers, with only one such ship, which is aging and increasingly hard to maintain, in its current fleet. The Integrated Program Office for the PSC, which the Coast Guard runs together with the U.S. Navy, received approval to proceed with building the first PSC on December 19, according to a press release put out yesterday. Bollinger Mississippi Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi is the current prime contractor for the new icebreakers. VT Halter Marine was originally hired to design and build three of the ships in 2019. Bollinger acquired VT Halter Marine in 2022. An older rendering of what was then VT Halter’s Polar Security Cutter design. Technology Associated, Inc. via VT Halter Marine 'This decision continues work that has been underway since the summer of 2023 as part of an innovative approach to shorten the delivery timeline of these critical national assets,' yesterday's Coast Guard release says. 'The approval incorporates eight prototype fabrication assessment units (PFAUs) that are currently underway or planned.' 'The PFAU effort was structured as a progressive crawl-walk-run approach to help the shipbuilder strengthen skills across the workforce and refine construction methods before full-rate production begins,' the release adds. 'The PFAU process has prepared the government and the shipbuilder to begin full-scale production of the PSC class, resulting in more precise, cost-effective, and reliable construction processes. ' 'The progressive crawl-walk-run approach consists of verifying the processes utilized during the build to ensure design completeness. This includes unit readiness reviews, ensuring engineering, computer-aided design systems accurately transfer numerical control data to automated production machinery and slowing down early prototype module build times to maximize learning and enable improvements in the downstream production, engineering, and planning processes,' the Coast Guard had also said last year when the PFAU work began. 'Each module requires approximately four months of labor, during which time the shipyard will continue recruiting and training additional members of the workforce to manage the transition to production of the lead hull as the prototype modules are completed.' As already noted, the Coast Guard currently has one heavy icebreaker in service, the USCGC Polar Star, which displaces some 13,840 tons with a full load. The PSCs are expected to be substantially larger, displacing around 17,690 tons. Heavy icebreakers, in general, are 'defined as ships that have icebreaking capability of 6 feet of ice continuously at 3 knots, and can back and ram through at least 20 feet of ice,' according to a report from the National Research Council of the National Academies. Metal blocks the US Coast Guard displayed at a PSC-related event in 2023 offering a visual depiction of the differences in hull thickness of a heavy icebreaker, at left, and a typical Coast Guard cutter, at right. A quarter and dime are seen at left and right, respectively, to help provide additional context for the comparitive thicknesses. USCG The PSCs will also be much more modern and otherwise capable vessels than the Polar Star. The latter ship was commissioned in 1976 and has become increasingly problematic to operate despite a multi-phase service life extension program (SLEP). Given its age, just sourcing parts for Polar Star can be troublesome and its sister ship USCGC Polar Sea was sidelined decades ago and cannibalized for spares. The trio of PSCs will be a welcome boost to the Coast Guard's overall icebreaking fleets, as well. Beyond Polar Star, the service has a lone medium icebreaker, the USCGC Healy, which was commissioned in 1999. The USCGC Polar Star, at left, and the USCGC Healy, at right, moored in Seattle on August 25, 2024. USCG Having just two ocean-going icebreakers presents obvious operational limits and increases the risks of capacity gaps as was underscored just earlier this year. Healy suffered a fire that cut its planned deployment short in July. At that time, Polar Star was undergoing phase four of its SLEP. This meant the Coast Guard had no medium or heavy icebreaking capacity at all until Polar Star returned to its home port in August. Healy has also since returned to service and wrapped up a 73-day Arctic deployment on December 12. The question now is when the new PSCs will actually enter service. The mention of the 'innovative approach to shorten the delivery timeline' in the Coast Guard's press release yesterday reflects the substantial delays the program has suffered to date. As mentioned, the lead ship was originally supposed to have been delivered this year. The second and third PSCs would then follow in 2026 and 2027. The schedule slips have been blamed in the past primarily on problems in finalizing the core design. As it stands now, the initial example may not arrive until 2029, a decade after the initial contract award. Concerns are growing about potential cost overruns, as well. There are additional plans to eventually acquire new Arctic Security Cutter (ASC) medium icebreakers, but that effort has yet to begin in earnest. The Coast Guard has acquired an additional existing ocean-going icebreaker, the Aiviq, off the commercial market. However, it's unclear when that ship will enter operational service as it still requires unspecified 'minimal modifications' to meet the requirements for its new U.S. government role. The vessel will be homeported in Juneau, Alaska, and renamed Storis, in honor of a previous Coast Guard light icebreaker of the same name with an impressive service career spanning from 1942 until 2007. At the time of its decommissioning, the previous USCGC Storis was the oldest operational ship in Coast Guard inventory. The previous USCGC Storis (WMEC-38) seen ahead of its decommissioning in 2007. USCG Though a welcome addition, the new Storis will offer an at best limited capacity boost. The Coast Guard itself declared that it 'requires a fleet of eight to nine polar icebreakers to meet operational needs in polar regions' in a separate press release yesterday about it taking formal ownership of what is still currently named the Aiviq.

Part of the ICE Pact includes taking steps to increase the icebreaker production capacity to support the needs of friendly nations. 'If we’re trying to build a long-term order book to create the demand signal we need to have the investment that’s required to generate scale,' a senior U.S. official told reporters around the rollout of the ICE Pact back in July. 'What we’re trying to do is to leverage the global order book. And our sense is if we look at allied nations that are trying to purchase icebreakers over the next decade, it’s 70 to 90 vessels.' All of this comes as the strategic significance of the Artic only continues to grow. Receding ice as a result of global climate change has opened up new access to natural resources, from oil and natural gas to fishing, as well as trade routes. New opportunities for potentially violent global competition have emerged as a result. For years now already, the Russian military has been expanding its ability to project air and naval power into the high north and the Chinese government has made clear it has ambitions in the region, as well. Russia also has the largest icebreaker fleet in the world by far, including nuclear-powered and combat-capable types. Finally moving ahead with the construction of the first PSC is an important development for the Coast Guard, but one that also unfortunately highlights the serious continued lag in acquiring these critical ships.

What We Know About The Russian Cargo Ship That Sank In Mediterran...	A Russian cargo ship claimed to be heading to Syria to take part in the Kremlin’s military withdrawal from that country, has sunk in the Mediterranean. The Ursa Major went down overnight between Spain and Algeria. The incident comes amid uncertainty over the fate of the Russian naval base at Tartus on the Syrian coast, which provides Moscow with a vital foothold in the Mediterranean. &#034;Ursa Major&#034;Video - 23.12.2024&mdash; Evgen Istrebin (@evgen-istrebin.bsky.social) 2024-12-24T07:40:04.273Z A Russian ship, Ursa Major, sank off the coast of Spain after an explosion. The cargo reportedly included nuclear icebreaker reactor hatches and two port cranes with a 120-ton capacity, en route to Vladivostok. 14 crew members were rescued, 2 are missing.&mdash; NOELREPORTS (@noelreports.com) 2024-12-24T08:51:12.529Z The Russian Foreign Ministry confirmed the cargo ship sank after an explosion in the engine room, the cause of which remains unclear. A video filmed from a tanker in the vicinity — the Ross Sea — showed the Russian ship listing badly to its starboard side, with its bow low in the water, between 12:00 and 1:00 p.m. GMT on Monday. It then sank at around 1:20 a.m. GMT on Tuesday. One of the ships involved in Russia’s evacuation from Syria, the cargo vessel Ursa Major, reportedly suffered a major engine room explosion in the Mediterranean and sank earlier today. Spanish press reports that 14 crew have been rescued, 2 are missing.&mdash; OSINTtechnical (@osinttechnical.bsky.social) 2024-12-24T00:30:56.858Z Spain’s Salvamento Marítimo maritime rescue agency said it received a distress signal from the Ursa Major on Monday when it was located around 57 miles off the coast of Almería. Two vessels and a helicopter were sent in response. A Spanish patrol boat picked up the 14 crew members from a lifeboat and brought them to the Spanish city of Cartagena. A Russian military vessel also provided assistance, later taking charge of rescue operations. The Russian Foreign Ministry says another two crew members are still unaccounted for. A Spanish Navy vessel (225988522) just popped up on AIS alongside Ursa Major.&mdash; Oliver Alexander (@oalexanderdk.bsky.social) 2024-12-23T20:10:48.897Z The Salvamento Marítimo alerted ships in the area to the 'possibility of shipwreck debris' and urged them 'to keep a sharp lookout, keep a wide berth' and report any sightings to authorities. Based on publicly available ship-tracking data, the Ursa Major had originally departed the port of St. Petersburg on December 11, with Russia claiming that its final destination was Vladivostok, in the Russian Far East. Russian accounts say that the vessel — 467 feet long, with a displacement of 12,679 tonnes — was carrying a pair of 380-tonne cranes to be used in the construction of a new nuclear-powered icebreaker, as well as other components to be used in the build. However, the Ukrainian military intelligence service, or GUR, claimed that the vessel was in fact headed to Syria, to take Russian 'weapons and equipment' out of that country, following the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime. The GUR made its claim on its Telegram channel yesterday after the cargo ship passed through the Strait of Gibraltar. Vehicles and other equipment seen clustered at the end of a pier at Russia’s Tartus naval base in Syria on December 17, 2024. Satellite image ©2024 Maxar Technologies The ship’s owner, Oboronlogistika, is a known Russian military contractor, described as 'part of the Russian defense ministry’s military construction operations.' Built in 2009, the vessel — together with its owner — was placed under sanctions by the United States in March 2022, after the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Since then, the Ursa Major has made frequent trips to Syria, transporting military equipment. Ursa Major had been in the same area of the Mediterranean as another sanctioned Russian ship, Sparta, both vessels having been noted heading through the English Channel last week, under Russian Navy escort. Over the weekend, the Portuguese Ministry of Defense confirmed that the Portuguese Air Force had been shadowing four Russian ships off its coast. As well as the Sparta, these were the drilling operations vessel Bavenit, and two Russian Navy landing ships: the Aleksandr Otrakovskiy and the Ivan Gren.

Portuguese Ministry of Defense Earlier this month, the Ukrainian GUR also reported that Sparta was heading to Russia’s naval base at Tartus on the Syrian coast to move military equipment out of Syria. However, Russian authorities said that the Sparta was sailing to Port Said in Egypt. In an incident yesterday, one of the two ships apparently broke down off the coast of Portugal. The GUR reported the ship involved as the Sparta, although it’s possible it was actually the Ursa Major — which was previously named Sparta III. The Ukrainian military intelligence service said that 'the main engine’s fuel pipe failed' but this problem was relatively quickly addressed and the ship began to move again. The cargo ship Sparta off the coast of Portugal at the weekend. Portuguese Ministry of Defense While it’s not been independently verified that the Ursa Major and Sparta were headed to Tartus, the incidents reinforce the Russian military’s reliance on contractors like Oboronlogistika to move critical equipment out of Syria. This has become even more critical since Ukraine has taken a heavy toll on the Russian Navy’s Black Sea Fleet landing ships, which have been prized targets since the start of the current conflict. What’s still unclear is whether the Russian Armed Forces will depart Syria altogether, or if they will continue to have some kind of access to Tartus and the air base at Khmeimim in Latakia province. Yesterday, a Kremlin official confirmed that Russia was in contact with the new Syrian rulers and was discussing the future of its two military facilities there.

Photo by Izzettin Kasim/Anadolu via Getty Images The importance of Tartus — the only Mediterranean port available to Russia — cannot be understated. With that in mind, it’s not surprising that Moscow is now negotiating with the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) Islamist group that led the offensive against the Assad regime, to ensure continued access. In the meantime, Russian military forces have completed their withdrawal from the Syrian interior, leaving a dwindling presence only at Tartus and Khmeimim. Russian soldiers stand by military pickups as they prepare to evacuate a position in Qamishli in northeastern Syria on December 12, 2024. Photo by Delil SOULEIMAN / AFP DELIL SOULEIMAN Some of the equipment formerly in Syria has been moved to Libya, suggesting that Russia might now be seeking to establish a longer-term military presence there, as an alternative. Some analysts have even suggested that the Ursa Major might have been headed to a Libyan port, with the plan to offload the two 380-tonne cranes there, either to support Libyan National Army commander Khalifa Haftar or to help establish a permanent Russian base. There have been reports that the HTS has demanded that Russia remove the last parts of its military contingent from Tartus and Khmeimim by February 20, 2025, although these are unconfirmed. This step would be in line with the new Syrian government’s aim to have the international sanctions placed on it lifted. Ultimately, the decision on the Russian military presence in Syria will be down to the country’s new rulers. Whatever happens, Russia will be heavily reliant on shipping, either to complete its evacuation from Syria or to re-establish its military presence there under new Syrian leadership.

F/A-18F Was Downed By Friendly Fire As Jets Were About To Land On...	A friendly fire incident in the Red Sea this past weekend that saw a U.S. Navy Ticonderoga class cruiser down an F/A-18F Super Hornet came as jets were returning to the supercarrier USS Harry S. Truman, TWZ has learned. The Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group had also been fending off a sustained Houthi drone and missile attack leading up to the friendly fire incident. You can read more about what is known about this incident in our earlier reporting here. 'After successfully returning from its initial mission, an F/A-18F launched again to provide air defense support from OWAs and ASCMs that were inbound to the force,' a U.S. official told us. 'They were shot down while recovery of remaining aircraft was underway.' The F/A-18F was officially downed early on December 22 local time by a missile from the Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Gettysburg. Aircraft from the Harry S. Truman's air wing had also struck Houthi targets in Yemen on the night of December 21-22.

'The wreckage has not been located and is likely at the bottom of the Red Sea. Both crew members were successfully recovered and are back on the USS Harry S. Truman. Initial reports are that one of the crew members has minor injuries. Both have been evaluated and released from medical.' Earlier today, Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) separately told us that the two-seat Super Hornet had been 'performing a refueling mission' at the time of the friendly fire incident. We had already reached out for more clarification on what exactly the jet's mission had been. Whether or not the jet was providing 'air defense support' or if it was in a tanker configuration primarily to support the jets providing air defense support at the time is unclear. As TWZ noted earlier, F/A-18Fs do regularly provide aerial refueling support for other aircraft in Navy carrier air wings. A stock picture of an F/A-18F with an aerial refueling tanker loadout of four 480-gallon fuel tanks and a centerline hose-and-drogue refueling pod. USN There are also rumors that another Navy jet was fired upon and almost accidentally shot down during the recovery process aboard the ship, as well, but TWZ has not been able to confirm that at this time. In comments to us tonight, the U.S. official did stress that 'an investigation is underway to determine the facts and circumstances' surrounding the friendly fire incident. Many questions remain about how and why the crew of the USS Gettysburg, the most advanced Ticonderoga class cruiser in operational service at present, which returned to the fleet last year with a slew of major upgrades to its air and missile defense suite and other systems, mistakenly shot down the F/A-18F. The fact that this appears to have occurred during recovery is even more puzzling. Regardless, the details as we understand them now underscore the complexities of the current operating environment that U.S. forces are facing in and around the Red Sea. As TWZ wrote earlier: 'The Red Sea is an extremely high-threat environment with multiple layers of threats, some of which can be very hard to detect and categorize. The Houthis are actively targeting American warships, as well as commercial vessels, with various aerial drones, cruise missiles, anti-ship ballistic missiles, and unmanned surface vessels, often simultaneously. The available time in which to make potentially serious decisions can be measured in seconds.' If nothing else, thankfully both aviators onboard the downed F/A-18F, who have now been released from medical, did not suffer any serious injuries or worse.

Railgun Ammo-Firing 155mm Air Defense Cannon Set To Be Awarded To...	The U.S. Army says it is planning to award a sole-source contract to BAE Systems to produce a prototype self-propelled 155mm howitzer for use as a novel air and missile defense system. The goal is for the Multi-Domain Artillery Cannon (MDAC) to be able to knock down drones and cruise missiles, as well as traditional aircraft and helicopters, using hyper-velocity ammunition originally developed for the U.S. Navy's canceled electromagnetic railgun program. The Army's Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office (RCCTO) announced its intention to hand BAE an MDAC deal via an Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) on December 20. This is a novel contracting mechanism designed to help U.S. government agencies accelerate advanced research and development and prototype efforts. RCCTO, in cooperation with the U.S. Air Force, has been pushing ahead with plans for MDAC since at least 2022. The MDAC effort is also leveraging similar work the Pentagon's Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO) has been doing in cooperation with the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) as part of a project called the Hypervelocity Ground Weapon System (HGWS). The current goal is to have a complete prototype MDAC battery on hand by the fourth quarter of Fiscal Year 2027 and then conduct an actual operational demonstration of the capability in Fiscal Year 2028. 'A full MDACS Battery consists of eight (8) Multi-Domain Artillery Cannons (MDAC), four (4) Multi-Function Precision Radars (MFPR), two (2) Multi-Domain Battle Managers (MDBM), and separately, no less than 144 Hypervelocity Projectiles (HVP),' according to the latest RCCTO contracting notice. 'The MDACS mission is to defend Joint Force fixed and semi-fixed locations against attack by a broad spectrum of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), Cruise Missiles (CM), Fixed Wing (FW), Rotary Wing (RW), and other advanced air and missile threats and to complement existing air and missile defenses by operating in integrated operational scenarios.' The contracting notice from RCCTO does not provide any details about BAE's proposed MDAC design or about any of the other planned elements of the prototype battery. The War Zone has reached out to BAE for more information. The Army has called for a wheeled 155mm howitzer design in the past to meet its MDAC requirements, according to a Request for Information (RFI) notice the service put out in July. The RFI also laid out demands for 'remote weapon firing capability,' 'high rates of fire with [the] HVP,' 'deep magazine capacity,' and 'rapid ammunition resupply time (manual and automated).' MDAC has also been depicted as being able to fit inside a C-130 cargo plane in the past, as seen below, which would add to its flexibility in future expeditionary and distributed operations. USAF The Army's MDAC stipulations do raise the question of whether BAE's MDAC could be based on the Archer self-propelled 155mm howitzer, which is notably not C-130 transportable in its current form. Developed by Bofors in Sweden, which is now a BAE subsidiary, Archer does however feature an auto-loader that feeds from 21-round a magazine. Per the manufacturer, the crew can emplace the howitzer from within the safety of its armored cab within 14 seconds, fire an initial round within 23 seconds, and pack back up to move after firing three more rounds within 74 seconds. These capabilities would align well with an air defense role requiring relatively rapid shots against multiple targets. The Army is also set to evaluate Archer as a possible new self-propelled 155mm howitzer for use as a traditional artillery piece as part of its Self-Propelled Howitzer Modernization (SPH-M) effort. BAE Systems could also be developing a completely new design to meet the MDAC requirements. As seen earlier in this story, the Army and the Air Force have shown a notional MDAC system in the past with a chassis that looks to be based on a 6&#215;6 member of the Family of Medium Tactical Vehicle (FMTV) series of trucks. Currently manufactured by Oshkosh Defense, the FTMV is one of the truck families in widespread Army service today. It is unclear whether or not the Multi-Function Precision Radar (MFPR) and the Multi-Domain Battle Manager (MDBM) portions of the MDAC battery will be entirely new systems, or include existing capabilities and/or ones the Army is already in the process of acquiring. 'The MDAC will interface with an external… Command and Control Battle Manager (C2BM) and the Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Battle Command System (IBCS),' according to the July RFI. ICBS is a new overarching air and missile defense-focused network architecture the Army is in the process of fielding now, which you can read more about here. When it comes to the HVP ammunition, as already noted, this was developed as part of the U.S. Navy's abortive electromagnetic railgun program. BAE developed the HVP, which looks to have given the company a leg up when it comes to the MDAC program. 'RCCTO believes BAE Systems Land & Armaments L.P. is the only responsible source capable of developing and delivering both the MDAC and HVP prototypes within the required schedule; competition of this effort is not practicable and will not meet mission fielding requirements,' the recent sole-source contracting announcement declares. A US Navy officer holds an example of the BAE Systems HVP design. USN The original HVP round was a hit-to-kill kinetic projectile designed to destroy targets simply by smashing into them after reaching a reported peak speed of 5,600 miles per hour. However, plans were already presented years ago now for versions with high-explosive warheads that 155mm howitzers and 5-inch naval guns could fire out to maximum ranges of 17 or 40 nautical miles, respectively. A now-dated US Navy briefing slide with details about the different versions of the BAE Systems HVP. USN Models of different versions of the BAE HVP design. Also note the different discarding sabots structures. Joseph Trevithick The HVP was also always envisioned as being able to engage aerial threats, as well as targets on land and at sea. In 2020, an Air Force-led test demonstrated the ability of a 155mm howitzer to knock down a BQM-167 target drone serving as a surrogate for a subsonic cruise missile with an HVP. U.S. military budget documents show plans at least for other more recent MDAC/HGWS test events, but what, if any results they produced are unclear. Another old US Navy briefing slide showing how railgun armed ships (as well as other platforms firing HVPs) could potentially engage a wide variety of aerial threats, including cruise missiles, as well as surface targets. USN A briefing slide related to the Navy's past railgun and HVP programs. It shows how ships could potentially engage a wide variety of aerial threats, including cruise missiles, as well as surface targets, with HVPs fired by conventional 5-inch naval guns. HGWS/MDAC could have similarly multi-purpose capabilities. USN Work on MDAC now comes amid an ever-expanding and evolving aerial threat ecosystem facing U.S. military forces deployed downrange, as well as in their home garrisons. A growing array of ever more capable armed drones and cruise missiles in service with near-peer competitors, especially China, as well as smaller countries and even non-state actors present particular concerns for America's armed forces. Larger and longer-ranged kamikaze drones are also steadily blurring the lines between uncrewed systems and traditional cruise missiles. Though drone and cruise missile threats are not new, as The War Zone regularly notes, the ongoing war in Ukraine, as well as crises in and around the Middle East in the past year or so, have re-emphasized the need for the development of new defensive capabilities. It is in this context that the Army is looking at MDAC as one way to provide a new, readily deployable air and missile defense capability that is also lower cost to employ than traditional surface-to-air missile systems. In the past, the per-round cost of BAE's HVP has been estimated to be $100,000 or less. Even current short-range man-portable Stinger surface-to-air missiles cost around $400,000 apiece, while upper-tier long-range interceptors like the PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) for the Patriot system have unit prices in the millions of dollars. It is important to stress that if MDAC does enter operational service in the future it would be deployed as part of layered defensive architecture and would not be able to provide all-around air and missile defense by itself in complex threat scenarios. The Army's work on MDAC also comes amid questions about the future of burden sharing between it and the Air Force when it comes to air base defense, both downrange and domestically. Since the Air Force was split off from the Army in the late 1940s, the latter service has retained the lead responsibility to protect airfields against aerial attack. Just this year, Air Force officials publicly questioned whether this division of roles and missions makes sense going forward. 'We know that, doctrinally, the Army has taken responsibility since the 1940s for air base air defense. We may have some questions on that,' Dr. Ravi Chaudhary, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Energy, Installations, and Environment, said during a virtual talk the Air & Space Forces Association hosted earlier this month regarding the rollout of a new base modernization strategy. 'We may want to enter in a broader discussion on what that’s going to look like going forward, because right now, the threats are so localized and so tactical that we may want to have a broader discussion … and take on some of those mission sets going forward.' 'Frankly, I would be comfortable with the Department of the Air Force taking on the total defense/local defense of air bases as an organic mission, if the needed resources – human and financial, etc – were made available,' Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall had also said during a keynote speech at the Airlift/Tanker Association’s (ATA) annual symposium in November. In the meantime, the Army is pressing ahead on MDAC, now with the planned sole-source deal with BAE Systems, and the goal of demonstrating this relatively exotic air and missile defense capability before the end of the decade.

Ex-Mossad Agents Reveal Details Of How They Turned Hezbollah’s Co...	Key details of the Israeli intelligence service’s operation targeting members of Hezbollah with exploding pagers and walkie-talkies in September have been revealed. You can read our reporting of the first wave of explosions here, and the second wave here. Israel didn’t initially admit responsibility for the blasts but was always acknowledged to have been behind them — although exactly how it orchestrated them had remained mysterious. The new information about the campaign was provided by two recently retired senior Mossad agents, who spoke with the 60 Minutes news magazine broadcast on the CBS television network. Both wore masks while interviewed and gave false names. First, it’s worth recapping how the operations played out. The first wave of explosions, on September 17, targeted pagers used by Hezbollah. At around 3:30 p.m. local time, it seems the pagers were triggered simultaneously, by a specific message. The message was one that looked, at least, as if it was sent by Hezbollah leadership. The detonation then happened with a slight delay. The second wave of explosions, on the following day, targeted walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah. A communication device on the ground as the Lebanese Army prepares to destroy it in a controlled explosion, in southern Lebanon between the villages of Burj al Muluk and Klayaa, on September 19, 2024. Photo by Rabih DAHER / AFP RABIH DAHER In total, thousands of devices used by the militant group were targeted. As might be expected for an operation so complex, it took years to shape, with the two Mossad agents — named as 'Michael' and 'Gabriel' — apparently being key players in its planning. According to CBS, work to weaponize the walkie-talkies began more than a decade before the attacks. It was already expected that the batteries of the devices were used to carry the explosives, confirmed by Michael, who noted that the walkie-talkies, in particular, were chosen since they would fit into the chest pockets of tactical vests used by the militants. As for the batteries, these were made in Israel at a Mossad facility, Michael said, and then put in more than 16,000 walkie-talkies, not all of which were used on September 16. A photo taken on September 18, 2024, in Beirut’s southern suburbs, shows the remains of exploded pagers on display at an undisclosed location. Photo by AFP To get these devices into Hezbollah’s hands, they were sold via shell companies, which then infiltrated the group. The chosen price was low enough to ensure that Hezbollah thought it was getting a good deal, but not too low to arouse suspicion. Since the walkie-talkies were expected to be carried in armored tactical vests, it was considered less likely that the targeted members of the group would be wearing them when they were detonated. After all, these vests would normally only be donned when the militant in question was actually taking part in an operation, or training for one. To make the operation more effective, weaponized pagers were added to the attack plans, with work on these starting much later, in 2022. In the case of the pagers — which were seen as much more reliable weapons, since they were carried by the targeted individuals at most times — Mossad discovered that Hezbollah was planning to buy such devices from a Taiwan-based company, Gold Apollo. The problem with the original Gold Apollo pagers was the size, since they appeared to be too slim to accommodate the explosives required. This led to Mossad running extensive tests, including detonating larger pagers on dummies, to calibrate the destructive effect. According to Gabriel, the amount of explosive was calculated to injure the targeted fighter, but not anyone next to them. While there are videos that show detonations injuring the targeted individual while leaving passersby unscathed, it’s also the case that other individuals — including at least two children — were killed.

Thought was given to the pager ring tones, to ensure they would sound urgent enough to draw a response. Meanwhile, the timer on the explosive charge was also calculated for maximum effect — the average time to call up the message on a pager after hearing the alert is seven seconds, according to Mossad. According to Gabriel, Dadi Barnea, the director of Mossad, was initially skeptical that the larger and heavier pager would be attractive to Hezbollah, who would likely favor a lighter and more portable device. But he was convinced otherwise and, meanwhile, Gabriel worked on an advertising campaign. 'We create a pretend world,' Michael explained. 'We are a global production company. We write the screenplay, we’re the directors, we’re the producers, we’re the main actors, and the world is our stage.' The advertising stressed the fact that the pagers were 'robust, dustproof and waterproof, with a long battery life.' These claims were presented in fake YouTube ads, backed up with fake online testimonials. This, of course, led to interest from individuals outside Hezbollah, who Mossad didn’t sell the devices to. Part of the strategy to keep them away from other customers involved quoting them exorbitant prices. People and first responders gather at the scene of a reported device explosion in Saida in southern Lebanon on September 18, 2024. Photo by Mahmoud ZAYYAT / AFP To get the pagers into Hezbollah’s hands, Mossad first had to supply them to Gold Apollo, which they also did via shell companies, including one in Hungary. A licensing partnership with Gold Apollo allowed Mossad to manufacture the pagers, while the Taiwanese firm still retained credibility. 'When they are buying from us, they have zero clue that they are buying from the Mossad. We make like the ‘Truman Show,’ everything is controlled by us behind the scene,' Gabriel told CBS. 'In their experience, everything is normal. Everything was 100 percent kosher.' To ensure that Hezbollah got the pagers, Mossad hired the relevant Gold Apollo saleswoman, who was unaware she was working with Israeli intelligence. The saleswoman offered the first batch of pagers to Hezbollah for free, while follow-on sales provided the militants with around 5,000 pagers by September 2024. The timing of the pager detonations was driven, to a significant degree, by concerns that the plot might be about to be uncovered. There was less suspicion around the walkie-talkies, which were detonated the following day, some of them exploding while being carried at funerals of those killed by the pagers.

Photo by Anwar AMRO / AFP Very quickly, Lebanon was gripped by panic, with residents, Hezbollah or otherwise, worried about what electronic devices would explode next. In the event, around 30 people were killed, including two children, in the two attacks. In addition, 3,000 people were injured, which was also part of Mossad’s plan.

And those people without hands and eyes are living proof, walking in Lebanon, of ‘don't mess with us.’' According to the former Mossad agents, the operation was a major success, undermining Hezbollah’s fighting capacity, decimating its leadership and command and control, and paving the way for the Israeli Air Force attacks that struck targets across Lebanon in the days after.

You can read all about that operation here. The retired Mossad agents speaking to CBS were clearly buoyed by the success of the operation targeting walkie-talkies and pagers, and by the diminished fighting capacity of Hezbollah. At the same time, the Israel Defense Forces were also steadily eroding Hamas, with a relentless campaign of bombardment in Gaza. More recently, the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria has prompted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to speak of a changing order in the region, with the heart ripped out of three of Iran’s key proxies there. Armed with Rampage missiles, an F-16 is prepared for a mission to strike Houthi targets in Yemen. IDF IDF 'After Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Assad regime in Syria, the Houthis are almost the last remaining arm of Iran’s axis of evil,' Netanyahu said last week. 'The Houthis are learning, and will learn the hard way, that those who strike Israel will pay a very heavy price for it.' As to the question of what Mossad does next, we can only guess. But what is clear is that the exploding walkie-talkies and pagers are very unlikely to be attempted again. 'We can’t use the pagers again because we already did that,' Michael told CBS. 'We’ve already moved on to the next thing. And they’ll have to keep on trying to guess what the next thing is.'

North Korea To Send More Troops To Fight For Russia Against Ukrai...	As the war in Ukraine drags on toward a fourth year, North Korea is preparing to send Moscow more troops beyond the 12,000 already there, as well as additional weapons, including suicide drones, according to the latest assessment from South Korean intelligence. This comes amid claims that casualties are mounting for Pyongyang's forces in Kursk. 'A comprehensive assessment of multiple intelligence shows that North Korea is preparing to rotate or increase the deployment of troops (in Russia),' the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said, without offering specific numbers, according to the Yonhap News Agency. Ukrainian officials are also seeing signs that North Korea might send more troops to Russia. 'Today, we also received a report from Commander-in-Chief Syrskyi on the frontline and the areas of the Kursk operation,' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Twitter. 'There are risks of North Korea sending additional troops and military equipment to the Russian army, and we will have tangible responses to this.' I held a meeting of the Staff.We thoroughly analyzed our work with Syria after the fall of Assad and his escape.Today, the intelligence services presented their reports—the Foreign Intelligence Service and the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine—as well as the Ministers of…&mdash; Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa) December 23, 2024 North Korea also reportedly plans to ramp up production of suicide drones for use against Ukrainian forces, a development we noted last month. 'There are also some signs of (the North) moving to manufacture and supply suicide drones, first unveiled during Kim Jong-un's on-site inspection in November,' the JCS said, according to Yonhap. The South Korean Joint Chiefs attributed the move to 'the North's efforts to gain practical warfare experience and modernize its conventional weapons system.' 'North Korea appears to be preparing to deploy additional troops and military equipment to Russia, possibly including suicide drones, in support of Moscow's war against Ukraine, the South's military said Monday.'A comprehensive assessment of multiple intelligence shows that… pic.twitter.com/bj7aVkjTvR&mdash; Rob Lee (@RALee85) December 23, 2024 A recent Wall Street Journal analysis of satellite imagery bolsters the South Korean JCS claim that North Korea is increasing weapons deliveries to Russia. The imagery shows 'that North Korea is shipping more munitions to Russia and is expanding arms production at home to churn out the weapons Moscow needs to feed its voracious war machine,' the publication reported. 'Assistance from North Korea is allowing Russia to press its advantage against exhausted Ukrainian troops and could help it resist pressure from the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump to end the conflict.' North Korea is providing 60% of the artillery and mortar shells used by Russia in Ukraine, Andriy Kovalenko, a Ukrainian army officer heading a government unit tasked with countering Russian disinformation, told WSJ. 'North Korean ammunition is holding the Russian defenses,' he said. 'North Korea’s missiles now make up nearly a third of Russia’s ballistic missile launches at Ukraine this year, according to Ukrainian officials.' The North Korean KN-23 short-range ballistic missile seen here may be among the types that Russia has received. North Korean State Media 'Russia is increasingly dependent on the DPRK,' Kovalenko said on Telegram Monday. 'They cannot extend the front without their ammunition, they are not able to fight in Kursk without their people, they will become increasingly dependent on their equipment.' Kovelenko called for Ukraine to continue to strike Russian economic assets to reduce its ability to pay for North Korean assistance. 'This is a great shame for Russia,' he posited. 'However, in the future, it is worth understanding that the Russian military-industrial complex will weaken, but the DPRK military-industrial complex will work, and so that it does not provide the Russian Federation's ability to fight, it is necessary to destroy the Russian Federation's economic ability to pay.' As we’ve previously reported, in addition to millions of rounds of artillery ammunition, North Korea has also provided Russia with KN-23 short-range ballistic missiles also known as Hwasong-11s. The ROK JSC assessment noted that Pyongyang is also supplying Russia with 240-millimeter rocket launchers and 170 mm self-propelled artillery. As we reported last week, shipments of North Korean 170mm M1989 Koksan self-propelled artillery units were seen on rail cars heading to the front lines. The main advantage of the weapon is its long range, with the big 170mm gun assessed as capable of firing a standard shell to a range of around 25 miles, or a rocket-assisted shell to a range of 37 miles. For a long time, the weapon was judged to be the longest-range conventional artillery piece in North Korean service. The Koksans first began to appear in Russia in November. You can see video of the recent rail shipment of these weapons below.

The arrangement is not an immediate quid pro quo, the publication added, but made by Kim in the hope of future benefits. 'U.S. officials do not believe Mr. Kim has received anything immediate in return,' the Times stated. 'Instead, they say, he appears to be hoping that Russia will repay the favor in the future by offering support in diplomatic fights, assisting if a crisis breaks out and providing technology.'

North Korea has received shipments of food from Russia in the past, South Korean lawmakers have said. It has also received 'more than a million barrels of oil since March this year, according to satellite imagery analysis from the Open Source Centre, a non-profit research group based in the UK,' according to the BBC. In exchange for sending troops to Russia, it was believed that North Korea would potentially receive air defense systems and additional energy supplies and was reportedly going to receive fighter aircraft as well. There have also been concerns that Moscow might provide North Korea with technologies to help accelerate its nuclear and long-range ballistic missile programs. Russia would also be a prime candidate to assist North Korea in pushing forward its submarine program, which also includes a growing family of submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) as well as increasingly advanced submarine technologies.

(Photo by Vladimir Smirnov / POOL / AFP) VLADIMIR SMIRNOV Regardless of the details of the deal, North Korean troops and weapons are helping Russia squeeze the salient Ukraine established when it invaded the Kursk region in August. They are being used 'as small, light infantry … and a little bit of indirect fire usage with mortar platoons, and things of that nature that they’ve been employing,' a senior U.S. military official told reporters, including from The War Zone, last week. 'As far as the capabilities, they’re consistent with what you would think they would have, their lower caliber indirect fire capability, and then direct fire capability, and obviously the kind of communications equipment that you would expect.' The North Koreans are reportedly paying an increasingly heavy price for aiding Russia. Their complete lack of previous combat experience is contributing to increasing casualties, the senior military official pointed out. 'They’re definitely up on the front line. They’re taking casualties. Based on the latest understanding that we have as of this afternoon, we’re looking at several hundred casualties … everything from wounds, up to being [killed in action] KIA.' On Monday, South Korea's spy agency suggested the figure was even higher now, with about 1,100 DPRK casualties, Yonhap reported. Zelensky on Monday claimed there were three times as many North Koreans killed or wounded. 'Now, according to preliminary data, the number of North Korean soldiers killed and wounded in the Kursk region has already exceeded 3,000,' Zelensky said.

The senior U.S. military official told us that the Pentagon concurs with previous reports that Ukraine has lost about 40% of the territory captured in Kursk during two major counter-operations. The news about Pyongyang's additional support for Moscow only adds to the pressure faced by Kyiv as the clock ticks down to a new Trump administration that could be far less supportive than Biden's. The Latest On the battlefield, Russia continues to gain ground in Kursk, but despite a large-scale push across eastern Ukraine, made only incremental gains toward Pokrovsk and Toretsk. According to the latest assessment from the Institute for the Study of War: Kursk: Russian forces recently advanced in the Ukrainian salient in Kursk Oblast amid continued fighting in the area on December 22. Russian forces continued assault operations southeast of Korenevo near Novoivanovka and Kruglenkoye, north of Sudzha near Malaya Loknya, Cherkasskoye Porechnoye, and Pogrebki; and northeast of Sudzha near Martynovka. Kharkiv: Russian forces continued ground attacks in the Kharkiv direction on December 22 but did not make any confirmed advances. Luhansk: Russian forces recently marginally advanced in the Kupyansk direction amid continued offensive operations along the Kupyansk-Svatove-Kreminna line on December 22. Donetsk: Russian forces conducted offensive operations northeast of Siversk near Serebryanka and Bilohorivka, east of Siversk near Verkhnokamyanske, southeast of Siversk near Vyimka, toward Chasiv Yar, Kurakhove, Vuhledar and near Velyka Novosilka on December 22 but did not make any confirmed advances. However, they recently advanced toward Toretsk and Pokrovsk. Zaporizhzhia: Ukrainian forces recently regained lost positions in western Zaporizhia Oblast following reports of localized Ukrainian offensive operations in the area. Geolocated footage published on December 22 indicates that Ukrainian forces recently regained lost positions in central Kamyanske (northwest of Robotyne and south of Zaporizhzhia City). Kherson: A Ukrainian official confirmed that Russian sabotage and reconnaissance groups recently attempted a limited crossing of the Dnipro River in Kherson Oblast. Ukrainian Southern Defense Forces Spokesperson Colonel Vladyslav Voloshyn stated on December 21 that Russian forces conducted heavy artillery and rocket strikes against the west (right) bank of Kherson Oblast on December 20, during which a Russian sabotage and reconnaissance group unsuccessfully attempted to cross the Dnipro River near the Antonivsky roadway bridge (east of Kherson City) - consistent with recent Russian milblogger claims on December 21.

'Two sources in air defense units told the Guardian the deficit at the front has become so acute that the general staff has ordered already-depleted air defense units to free up more men to send to the front as infantry,' the publication reported. 'It’s reaching a critical level where we can’t be sure that air defense can function properly,' one of the sources told the Guardian, adding he had been prompted to speak out by a fear that the situation was a risk to Ukraine’s security. 'These people knew how air defense works, some had been trained in the West and had real skills, now they are sent to the front to fight, for which they have no training,' said the source. Another concern is that if any of these troops are captured, they could provide critical information about the location and capabilities of Ukrainian air defense systems. Ukrainian Air Force spokesman Col. Yuri Ignat pushed back on the assertion that his country's air defenses would suffer as a result of this mobilization. 'Of course, transferring to the Infantry creates problematic issues with personnel inside the Air Force,' he said Sunday on Facebook. 'There are not enough people and that's also a well-known fact! But why talk about the ineffectiveness of the [air defenses] and that the [interceptions of Russian aerial threats] have become less? After all, the [air defenses] are not just the Air Force! It is an air defense system of the country that includes units of all Defense Forces capable of conducting air fire, and infantry, sailors, and helicopters&#8230;' This all comes as Zelensky has refused to heed public calls from the Biden administration to lower the age at which men can be mobilized from 25, where it currently stands, to 18, citing the sensitivities of sending younger men to fight in a society that already faces a demographic crisis.

Speaking on national TV, Sergeant Volodymyr Dehtiarov, spokesperson for the Khartiia Brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine, said 'dozens of units of robotic and unmanned equipment' supported by surveillance drones were used in the assault, the Kyiv Independent reported. The attack took place near the village of Lyptsi, north of Kharkiv. Dehtiarov said the drones included uncrewed ground vehicles (UGV) equipped with machine guns and kamikaze FPV drones. He did not say when this engagement took place. 'The Battle of Lyptsi is an important step in the transformation of the character of war from a purely human endeavor to something quite different in the 21st century,' retired Australian Army Maj.

He was the first to report the all-drone assault. 'While other nations are watching these developments closely, Ukraine is establishing itself as a full-scale testing ground for technologically advanced warfare,' he noted. 'The drones and UGVs used in this attack were reportedly mostly indigenously designed or modified from commercial equipment. This ability to tinker and adapt off-the-shelf technologies for military use has become a signature of the Ukrainian forces.'

They also present real threats to vessels in port, as well as bridges and other coastal infrastructure. Now Russia is taking a page from that playbook. Its navy is creating a new training course for USV operators that includes nighttime drills to mimic Ukrainian USV attacks and defenses, according to the Russian RU1 news outlet.

Among them is a cruise missile called Trembita, named for the Ukrainian Alpine horn, The Economist reported on Monday. 'We might miss our target,' Serhiy Biryukov, who heads the missile’s ragtag crew of volunteer engineers, told the publication, 'but we’ll fly the thing so low above Russian trenches they will shit themselves.' 'Trembita’s engine is a modern $200 remake of the pulsejet first used on the German V-1 bomb in 1944,' The Economist noted. 'The engine tube is rough-and-ready. A more stylish grey rectangular casing hangs below it, hiding the missile’s guidance system and warhead. The basic Trembita flies at 400 km/h with a range of 200km. A larger and more powerful model is being developed to reach Moscow. Serial production is set to follow the final field tests. Getting this far has taken the enthusiasts just a year and a half—a feat in a field where getting from the drawing board to the battlefield usually takes many years.'

What’s In The Bill That Aims To Revitalize America’s Decaying Nav...	A sprawling, bipartisan proposal to rebuild America’s long-ailing shipbuilding industry was introduced by a group of lawmakers last week. Known as the Shipbuilding and Harbor Infrastructure for Prosperity and Security (SHIPS) for America Act, the ambitious bill seeks to overhaul and restore America’s military and civilian maritime capacity and capabilities. These industries have increasingly fallen behind over the decades, and concerns have grown urgent as China’s shipbuilding capacity continues to dwarf America’s in many respects. 'This is the first major piece of maritime reform since the Merchant Marine Act of 1970,' Sal Mercogliano, a former Military Sealift Command mariner and associate professor of history at Campbell University, told USNI News’ Mallory Shelbourne this week. 'So you’re talking about 55 years since we’ve had anything like this.' Bipartisan SHIPS Act Aims to Revitalize U.S. Maritime Industry, Counter China's DominanceKey Provisions of the SHIPS for America Act1&#x20e3;National Maritime Strategy: Establishes a Maritime Security Advisor within the White House and a Maritime Security Board to coordinate…&mdash; Sal Mercogliano (WGOW Shipping) (@mercoglianos) December 19, 2024 'By supporting shipbuilding, shipping, and workforce development, it will strengthen supply chains, reduce our reliance on foreign vessels, put Americans to work in good-paying jobs, and support the Navy and Coast Guard’s shipbuilding needs,' one of the bill's co-sponsors, Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), a Navy veteran and the first U.S Merchant Marine Academy graduate elected to Congress, said in a statement. Among its many provisions, the SHIPS Act would require the Navy to develop a strategy for a 'rearm-at-sea' capability for the surface fleet. It doesn’t specify which platforms would get the capability, but the sea service has already been testing systems for reloading vertical launching system (VLS) missile cells at sea, and did it successfully for the first time in October. In that instance, the Military Sealift Command’s dry cargo ship USNS Washington Chambers (T-AKE 11) transferred an empty VLS weapon container to the USS Chosin (CG-65), a Ticonderoga class cruiser, while underway off southern California. Such a capability would be vital during a war against China in the expanses of the Western Pacific, one that would likely involve a heavy volume of missile fire by Navy warships far from ports. Being able to reload at sea helps mitigate such a challenge. Sailors change out an empty Vertical Launching System (VLS) weapon container aboard the Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Chosin (CG-65) in October. (U.S. Navy) The act would also help private shipbuilders to better service military and commercial customers by requiring the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard to assess and integrate commercial best practices for designing, repairing, and building vessels. As the United States seeks to get its shipbuilding house in order, China's Military-Civil Fusion strategy in shipbuilding has already given the country a massive long-term edge in building commercial, naval and support vessels relatively efficiently and cheaply compared to America and its allies. Some in the U.S. have started to call for similar integration of commercial and naval shipbuilding. 'The United States has substantial latent shipbuilding, sustainment, and repair capacity, including aging but not obsolete capital assets, a strong base of potential skilled-trade labor, and a middle-management and engineering talent base that has become geographically separated from shipyards,' McKinsey and Co., a consultancy, wrote in June. 'Rapidly increasing output requires tapping into this latent capacity quickly and confidently.' The legislation would also mandate a plan for how the Defense Production Act could be used to enhance shipyard infrastructure, the defense shipyard industrial base, and port infrastructure. It would work to bolster smaller shipyards, providing $100 million annually from Fiscal Year 2025 to 2034. A loan fund would also be stood up for reflagging vessels or 'converting a vessel to a more useful military configuration.' The SHIPS Act further seeks to expand the American shipyard industrial base for military and civilian vessels by way of a 25 percent tax credit for such investments, while establishing other financial incentives to encourage innovation in shipbuilding and repair. A U.S. Center for Maritime Innovation, with hubs across the country, would work to accelerate next-generation ship design, alternative energy and manufacturing as well. All these steps seek to help the Navy and American shipbuilding industry that struggle to get new platforms out on time and on budget, while supporting those that are already in the water. The latter has been a massive challenge as the Navy's fleet ages while demands for more hulls increase. Crumbling shipyards around the U.S. and a limited number of them that can support mainline military vessels is a huge problem that has led to major delays in maintenance, greatly harming available end strength. It is also of major concern if ships were to get damaged in battle during a conflict and need to be regenerated quickly. While some improvements and investments have been made in upgrading shipyards, it is still a glaring and highly concerning issue. In the shipyards, America’s shipbuilding capacity was in decline even before the end of the Cold War, and shrunk more afterward. It is at a particularly low point, an ebb helped along by the yards’ struggle to attract a sufficient workforce. 'Currently, the United States and China have relative parity in overall economic output,' retired Marine Corps Maj. Jeffrey L. Seavy, noted in the U.S. Naval Institute's Proceedings publication in April. 'In terms of shipbuilding, however, China has 46.59 percent of the global market and is the largest builder, with South Korea second at 29.24 percent, and Japan third with 17.25 percent. The United States has a relative insignificant capacity at 0.13 percent.' To offset domestic shortfalls, Navy leaders have been exploring the possibility of repairing U.S. ships in Korean or Japanese shipyards, although by law American warships can't be built outside of the states. The nation's sealift capacity has been deteriorating as well. U.S. Transportation Command leaders told Congress in April that sealift readiness was a primary concern, and that 17 of the 47 Ready Reserve Force ships were more than 50-years-old, which was dragging readiness rates to alarming levels. To bolster the U.S. sealift fleet, the bill would allow the U.S. to enter into agreements with treaty allies to meet sealift requirements. Already, the Navy is testing the waters for using Pacific allies for such logistics needs. The U.S.-flagged international fleet would also grow to 250 ships in 10 years via a 'Strategic Commercial Fleet Program' to establish 'a fleet of commercially operated, U.S.-flagged, American crewed, and domestically built merchant vessels that can operate competitively in international commerce,' according to a summary of the bill provided by the Kelly's office. 'The United States has fewer than 200 oceangoing vessels of the United States, of which only approximately 80 vessels participate in international commerce, compared with more than 5,500 Chinese documented vessels,' the legislation states. 'In order to increase the fleet rapidly, carriers may also submit a bid to bring a foreign-built vessel into the fleet and reflag it,' the bill states. In a nod to how U.S. officials view China as a threat beyond its military, the bill also calls for an evaluation of the Chinese government-affiliated National Transportation and Logistics Public Information Platform, or LOGINK. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission warned in 2022 that LOGINK 'potentially provides the Chinese Communist Party access to data collected and stored on the platform and could enable the Chinese government to gain insights into shipping information, cargo valuations via customs clearance forms, and destination and routing information.' LOGINK, which operates in more than 20 global ports, could undercut U.S. firms economically and expose supply chain vulnerabilities, according to the commission. On the personnel side, the bill would give the Navy Secretary additional authority to recruit and retain civilian mariners working under the MSC. These mariners would play a vital role manning ships moving troops and materiel in the event of a war with China, but the command has struggled with finding enough people. MSC announced in November that it would sideline 17 support vessels to ease the strain on the civilian mariner workforce amid personnel shortages, USNI News’ Mallory Shelbourne reported. Japanese sailors aboard the guided-missile destroyer JS Shimakaze say goodbye to civilian mariners aboard the fleet replenishment oiler USNS Harvey Milk following a replenishment-at-sea in September 2024. (U.S. Military Sealift Command) To keep such civilian mariners around, the bill would also allow merchant mariners or U.S. shipyard employees to qualify for loan forgiveness if they are employed on an American vessel or shipyard for 10 years. Mariners who have received the Merchant Marine Expeditionary Medal or other mariner medals for service in a designated combat zone would also become eligible for G.I. Bill benefits under the legislation if they were not already eligible. To find new talent, the bill would enact targeted recruiting campaigns run by private marketing firms to promote maritime industry careers, and would have military recruiters recommend at-sea or shipyard careers to prospects who don’t qualify for military service. If passed, the bill would also raise the profile of maritime security affairs by creating a maritime security advisor role within the White House that would lead whole-of-government decisions about American maritime strategy. The SHIPS Act was introduced last week by co-sponsor Kelly and U.S. Rep. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.), a supporter of the plan and President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for national security advisor. Other sponsors include Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.), U.S. Rep. John Garamendi (D-Calif.), ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee’s Subcommittee on Readiness and U.S. Rep. Trent Kelly (R-Miss.), chairman of the House’s Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee whose home state hosts several major shipyards. NEW: Today I introduced legislation to revitalize America’s ailing maritime industry. It’s one of the biggest problems no one is talking about — and fixing it will create jobs, lower prices, and strengthen our national security. Let me tell you how. pic.twitter.com/KEXHq90eBg&mdash; Senator Mark Kelly (@SenMarkKelly) December 19, 2024 The legislation is paid for via a Maritime Security Trust Fund, similar to existing highway and aviation trust funds. A Kelly spokesperson told TWZ that the bill authorizes $18.1 billion over a decade. The legislation states those funds will come from duties, fees, and penalties imposed on vessels in international commerce, regular tonnage taxes proceeds, special tonnage taxes, light money, duties imposed on foreign nations and tariffs, which are all collected by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Industry appears to support the legislation, as its announcement features a bevy of American maritime interests, including shipbuilding associations, shipbuilding corporations, academia and defense groups. TWZ has regularly reported on the shortfalls of the U.S. shipbuilding industry over the years. A leaked U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence slide revealed in 2023 that China’s shipbuilders are believed to be more than 200 times more capable of producing surface combatants, support ships and submarines than their American counterparts. This is due to the country being a major shipbuilder globally and the ability to use its yards to build military and commercial vessels as needed. Such a revelation underscored longstanding worries about the U.S. Navy’s ability to challenge Chinese fleets, or sustain its forces afloat, during a war. Reporting at the time explained the significance of that slide: 'The most eye-catching component of the slide is a depiction of the relative Chinese and U.S. shipbuilding capacity expressed in terms of gross tonnage. The graphic shows that China’s shipyards have a capacity of around 23,250,000 tons versus less than 100,000 tons in the United States. That is at least an astonishing 232 times greater than the United States.' A U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence slide showcases the differing shipbuilding capabilities of the United States and China. (U.S. Navy) At more than 370 ships by the Pentagon’s latest count, in terms of hulls alone, the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) already exceeds the Navy’s battle force fleet of nearly 300. The ONI slide revealed that, by 2035, the gap between Chinese ships and U.S. vessels will widen substantially. Navy leaders have at times in recent years sought to downplay the numeric differential between the rival fleets, as TWZ reported last year. Much legislation gets introduced with great fanfare and urgency, only to fall by the wayside once the sausage-making commences. Whether the SHIPS Act suffers the same fate remains to be seen. It would seem to be inline with incoming president Trump's general view of the need to revitalize American industrial production. Stabilizing the shipbuilding and vessel support base would seem to be part of that general concept, along with the goal of building a stronger Navy. Either way, it signals that the U.S. maritime universe’s long-chronicled deficiencies are now attracting attempts at meaningful higher-level action.

F/A-18F Shot Down By Friendly Cruiser Was In The Middle Of A Refu...	A U.S. Navy F/A-18F Super Hornet was conducting a refueling mission over the Red Sea when it was downed in a friendly fire incident this past weekend. The Ticonderoga class USS Gettysburg fired on the jet for reasons that are now under investigation. That cruiser also happens to be the first of its class to have gone through a deep modernization program that includes significant upgrades to its air defense suite, making it the most advanced operational example of its dwindling class. 'The [F/A-18F] aircraft is part of Carrier Airwing (CVW) 1 and was performing a refueling mission,' the Navy's Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) said in a statement to TWZ earlier today. We have reached out for further clarification about whether the two-seat Super Hornet was acting as the tanker and/or whether it was linked to another aircraft at the time of the shoot down. The Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Gettysburg. USN USS Gettysburg engaged and brought down the F/A-18F on December 22 local time, according to a previously released statement from U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM). Gettysburg and CVW-1 are both currently assigned to the Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group. Truman, its air wing, and its escorts had just entered the Red Sea last week. The strike group is currently supporting operations to protect and friendly military assets from attacks by Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen, including strikes ashore. CENTCOM Conducts Airstrikes Against Iran-Backed Houthi Missile Storage and Command/Control Facilities in YemenTAMPA, Fla. - U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) forces conducted precision airstrikes against a missile storage facility and a command-and-control facility operated by… pic.twitter.com/YRWWQJIweP&mdash; U.S. Central Command (@CENTCOM) December 21, 2024 'Both pilots were safely recovered,' CENTCOM's prior statement added. 'Initial assessments indicate that one of the crew members sustained minor injuries. This incident was not the result of hostile fire, and a full investigation is underway.' 'Pilots' here looks to be a misnomer. The individual flying in the backseat of an F/A-18F is typically a Weapon Systems Officer (WSO), not a second pilot, and this was reportedly the case in this instance, according to The Washington Post's Dan Lamothe. Lamothe also reported, citing an anonymous military official, that a Standard Missile-2 (SM-2) was the weapon Gettysburg fired that brought down the Super Hornet, that the two crew members had both suffered minor injuries, and that the Navy considering whether or not to recover the wreckage. 3) Navy was assessing Sunday whether to salvage any of the downed jet, and how. 4) The two aviators are back aboard the aircraft carrier Truman with minor injuries. Those would not be uncommon after an ejection.&mdash; Dan Lamothe (@DanLamothe) December 22, 2024 The SM-2 family is a key element of the Navy's arsenal of ship-launched surface-to-air missiles. Since October 2023, SM-2s have been weapons of choice for U.S. naval forces in the Middle East for engaging Houthi missiles and drones. In addition, Ticonderoga class cruisers currently act as the central air and missile defense node for Navy carrier strike group. Whether or not to attempt to retrieve any portion of the downed F/A-18F will be an important question for the Navy. As TWZ has highlighted many times in the past, adversaries could try to do the same and glean useful intelligence from whatever they recover. When it comes to refueling mission, F/A-18 Super Hornets are currently routinely employed as tankers for other aircraft in Navy carrier air wings, typically flying stable orbits relatively close to the strike group for recovery operations, but are also used to refuel jets after launch or on their way to their objectives. They execute this in the '5-wet' configuration, with four 480-gallon fuel tanks and a centerline hose-and-drogue refueling pod. The services plans to supplant Super Hornets in this role with a new fleet of MQ-25 Stingray aerial refueling drones, which will also have secondary intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities and could take on other missions in the future. Unfortunately, the MQ-25 program has been beset by delays and other issues and Stingrays are not expected to begin flying operational missions until at least 2026. Land-based tanker aircraft also regularly support Navy carrier-based aircraft. While few other details regarding this past weekend’s friendly fire incident have emerged, a lot of things can go wrong and cause fratricide in such an environment, according to Bradley Martin, a retired Surface Warfare Officer (SWO) who spent two-thirds of his 30-year Navy career at sea. 'Aircraft might not have had its identification on,' he told TWZ Monday. 'The profile that was being reported in the Aegis system might have looked like a threat, so the operators are looking at it and trying to determine what they’re seeing and make a decision in fairly short order.' Battle management combat systems like Aegis are not perfect, Martin said. 'They occasionally misreport things or cause dual tracks, or they’ll not correctly identify something,' he continued, adding that sometimes it’s a combination of equipment and operator error. Near-misses happen 'all the time,' Martin added, where an operator is looking at a screen and trying to figure out what they are seeing in a very short period of time. 'Especially when you’re dealing with a wartime environment,' he noted. ‘The Navy’s fired a lot of missiles in the last year, more than it has in decades.' TWZ has previously noted how the Houthi's very active campaign targeting ships in and around the Red Sea, combined with the congested nature of the operating environment in the region, raises the risks of accidental shootdowns. Just in February, a German Navy warship sailing in the Red Sea fired on a U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone, but did not bring it down, in a case of mistaken identity. There are many other instances of aircraft being accidentally damaged or shot down, especially in the midst of active conflicts. The now-decommissioned Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Vincennes was involved in a particularly infamous incident in the midst of the Iran-Iraq War in 1988 where it shot down Iran Air Flight 655, killing everyone onboard. Issues with the Aegis Combat System's user interface at the time, as well as stress, timing, and confusion, have been cited as contributing factors. Thanks to a major upgrade program, the Aegis system on Gettysburg is one of the most modern currently in service, as you can read more about here. Unlike Vincennes in 1988, the cruiser also has the benefit of a much more advanced overall sensor suite with deep networking and sensor fusion capabilities on top of its far more advanced Aegis system. Decades of evolutionary enhancements have made it a very different combination of capabilities than it was nearly four decades ago. At the same time, we don't know what systems were operating on the ship at the time of the friendly fire incident this weekend or what other sources of data, such as from an E-2 Hawkeye airborne early warning and control aircraft and other ships in the region, that might have been available to feed into the crew's overall picture of the battlespace. E-2 Hawkeye airborne early warning and control aircraft. Northrop Grumman As the retired SWO Martin highlighted, the current situation U.S. forces are contending with in the Red Sea is an extremely high-threat environment with multiple layers of threats, some of which can be very hard to detect and categorize. The Houthis are actively targeting American warships, as well as commercial vessels, with various aerial drones, cruise missiles, anti-ship ballistic missiles and unmanned surface vessels, often simultaneously. The available time in which to make potentially serious decisions can be measured in seconds. The friendly fire incident also shined a new and unwelcome light on the Ticonderoga class's woes, including when it comes the much-maligned modernization program for a handful of the remaining ships. The original plan had been to substantially upgrade 11 of the cruisers, which would serve in the 2030s. The Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Chosin seen in the process of being upgraded. USN However, as it stands now, only three Ticonderogas will be modernized – USS Gettysburg, USS Chosin, and USS Cape St. George – and they may only deploy once more each before their scheduled decommissioning dates in the coming years. A report from GAO, a Congressional watchdog, published earlier this month, described the cruiser modernization effort as a poster child for how not to run such an effort, saying that around $1.84 billion had been wasted on modifications to ships that never returned to sea. The report also highlighted issues with Gettysburg, specifically, post-modernization and in the run-up to its current deployment. 'USS Gettysburg completed its modernization, including sea trials, in February 2023. The Navy’s Board of Inspection and Survey determined the ship meets the minimum standard to get to sea,' according to GAO. 'However, in January 2024 the Navy’s Board of Inspection and Survey identified several outstanding issues during an inspection of the ship’s condition. For example, several elements of the weapons systems were inoperable or degraded and there were structural issues throughout the ship. Since the inspection, the Navy has addressed several of these issues and the ship completed 18 days at sea in June 2024 in preparation for deployment. During this time at sea, USS Gettysburg completed a successful missile launch and intercept using its updated combat systems software.' 'The Navy deployed USS Gettysburg in September 2024 with its carrier strike group. Prior to the deployment, the ship’s crew told us that parts continued to be a problem, including steering gears and hydraulic power unit solenoid valves, among others,' GAO's report added. 'To address this problem, the Navy used parts from the decommissioned cruisers. According to the ship’s crew, propulsion plant and electric system failures were key concerns for the USS Gettysburg deployment.' A view of USS Gettysburg from the ship's bow in October 2024. USN Petty Officer 2nd Class Kaitlin Young GAO said that the Navy was looking to see how Gettysburg performed on its latest deployment before making any decisions about whether to send it out again before decommissioning it. The service has long said now that the Ticonderoga class as a whole has become increasingly unreliable and the ships have been suffering from hull cracking and other structural issues for years already. It is important to stress again that the chain of events that led to Gettysburg bringing down the Super Hornet over the Red Sea remains unknown, including whether or not any issues with the ship itself played a role. 'This kind of mistake sadly is almost inevitable,' Martin, the retired SWO, told TWZ. 'A sky full of aircraft, some friendly, a lot not friendly, ships trying to sort out occasionally ambiguous situations under a great deal of time pressure. These things will almost inevitably occur.' Martin said everyone should recognize that these things can and do happen in an intense enough combat environment, and that the Navy needs to be transparent about what happened. 'The public, the media, me, would be willing to accept that these things happen, this was an accident and [the Navy] has done something to prevent it,' he said. 'Fortunately, in this case, it wasn’t a tragedy, it was just a loss of an expensive airplane.' The Navy is just at the start of its investigation into the friendly fire incident over the week and more details about exactly what happened could emerge as that effort gets more underway. As Martin notes, in this instance, thankfully the two aviators onboard the F/A-18F were able to safely eject.

Massive Uptick In Official Drone Sightings By Nuclear Power Plant...	The number of drone flyovers of nuclear plants for the entire year nearly doubled in one week, from December 10th to December 17th, according to data provided to The War Zone by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Between Jan. 1 and Dec.10, nuclear facility licensees reported a total of 15 drone events. As of about 1 p.m. Dec., 17, that number had jumped to 26, NRC spokesman Dave McIntyre told The War Zone on Friday in response to our query. While the timeline overlaps with a rash of drone sightings across the country and especially in the New Jersey area - including over military installations and energy infrastructure - it is unclear at the moment what, if any, connection there is to the dramatic increase in suspicious drone events over nuclear facilities. Salem Nuclear Power Plant (L, two domes) and Hope Creek Nuclear Generating Station reported a drone flyover on Dec. 14. It is one of 26 across the nation to have reported such an incident. (STAN HONDA/AFP via Getty Images) STAN HONDA '&#8230;before January 2024, nuclear power plant licensees voluntarily reported flyovers by uncrewed aerial systems, such as drones, to the Federal Aviation Administration; law enforcement (local and the FBI); and the NRC,' McIntyre told The War Zone. 'Because reporting was voluntary, our information may not reflect the total number of UAS overflights of nuclear power plants.' Once a flyover is reported, he added, 'the NRC provides the specifics to other agencies for follow-up, including the FBI. The NRC does not investigate this type of activity once it has been reported.' We reached out to the NRC, FBI, FAA and Department of Homeland Security for more context about these flyovers. We will update this story with any pertinent information provided. The most recent publicly known drone sightings were over the Public Service Energy & Gas (PSEG) Nuclear Salem and Hope Creek generating stations, located at Lower Alloways Creek Township, in Salem County, New Jersey. 'Yes, drones were seen in the vicinity of Salem and Hope Creek (they’re the same site) last weekend,' NRC spokesperson Diane Screnci told us on Dec. 20. She did not provide a specific date, but a PSE&G spokesperson issued a statement saying that a flyover occurred on Dec 14. A sign instructing residents what to do when hearing the emergency siren in Lower Alloways Township, New Jersey, site of the Salem Nuclear Power Plant and Hope Creek Nuclear Generating Station. Salem is a dual unit pressurized water reactor and Hope Creek is a single unit boiling water reactor situated on the Delaware River. (STAN HONDA/AFP via Getty Images) STAN HONDA The Hope Creek generation station, which produces nearly half of the state's energy, was one of 22 facilities to have its airspace banned to drones by the Federal Aviation Administration on Dec. 18. You can see the full list of sites where the FAA issued temporary flight restrictions (TFR) in our story about that here. 'While DHS and our federal partners continue to see no evidence of a threat, the purpose of the TFR is to discourage drone flights around these areas, as requested by the critical infrastructure partners,' DHS said in a statement on Dec. 19. 'DHS and other security partners routinely request the FAA establish TFRs to restrict drone flights in areas where the drones could be unsafe or pose a security risk.' The restrictions affect drones operating below 400 feet and last until Jan. 17. There is always the possibility that the timeline could be extended or additional communities have their airspace similarly closed. Notice To Airmen (NOTAM) warning of TFRs for drone flights over the Hope Creek generation station (FAA) On Friday, the FAA issued 68 more TFRs across New York state. As with the New Jersey TFRs, these banned drone flights over energy infrastructure. 'At the request of federal security partners, the FAA published 30 Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs) prohibiting drone flights over critical New York infrastructure,' the FAA told us after the first 30 were issued. Another 38 were ordered later on Friday. 'On the NY TRFs, would refer you back to our statement and background we provided on the NJ TFRs,' DHS told us on Friday. 'We continue to assess there is no public safety threat relating to the reported drone sightings, and like in NJ, the FAA issued temporary flight restrictions over some critical infrastructure facilities in NY out of an abundance of caution.' Screenshot The day before, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul told the media that the action was 'purely precautionary; there are no threats to these sites.' Like the New Jersey TFRs, these ban virtually all drone operations below 400 feet in a one-mile radius. The restrictions last until Jan. 18. The FAA provided locations for the first 30 of those: Farragut Substation - Brooklyn, NY 4/9171 E 13th St. Substation - New York, NY 4/9167 EF Barrett Substation - Oceanside, NY 4/9192 Goethals Substation - Staten Island, NY 4/9186 Fresh Kills Substation - Staten Island, NY 4/9180 Roslyn Substation – Roslyn Heights, NY 4/9189 Newbridge Rd.

Substation – Glenwood Landing, NY 4/9214 Drone flights over nuclear facilities have been increasing over the years, nearly doubling from the 12 reported in 2019 to 23 reported last year, according to the data provided to us by the NRC. NRC In September 2019, America’s most powerful nuclear plant, the Palo Verde Nuclear Generation Station near Tonopah, Arizona experienced a rash of drone overflights. In a trove of documents and internal correspondences related to the event, NRC officials described the incident as a 'drone-a-palooza' and said that it highlighted concerns about the potential for a future 'adversarial attack' involving small unmanned aircraft and the need for defenses against them. You can read more about this from our exclusive story at the time here. The Palo Verde Nuclear Generation Station experienced several drone flyovers in September 2019. (Google Earth) The drastic increase in drones reported to be flying over nuclear power plants comes amid a growing frenzy over mysterious objects in the sky that came after we broke the story about incursions over Picatinny Arsenal in northern New Jersey. The FBI has stated that out of some 5,000 sighting reports, fewer than 100 merited further investigation. Still, the hysteria over drones has grown to the point where the FBI and New Jersey State Police had to plead with the public not to shoot lasers or bullets into the sky at any object flying overhead. The warning was not hypothetical. Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst officials told The War Zone that pilots of 15 fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft from Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst had reported being struck by lasers from the ground since Dec. 7. One of those pilots had to seek medical treatment but was quickly released, but all aircraft involved landed safely. All this comes as drone incursions are being reported over military bases at home and abroad. Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton in southern California confirmed to The War Zone on Tuesday that it had experienced multiple such incidents over its airspace in the past several days. It joins a growing list of military installations in the United States experiencing recent drone incursions, that also includes Hill Air Force Base in Utah, which reported drone incursions on Monday. Drones have also flown over Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio forcing the closure of its airspace, which we were the first to report and they intruded on Naval Weapon Station Earle’s airspace and several unknown aircraft recently followed a Coast Guard vessel. The airspace over Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio was closed earlier this month because of drone incursions. (Public domain) Last month, drones also appeared over four U.S. Air Force bases in the U.K., another story we first broke, and more recently also over Ramstein Air Base in Germany. Drone incursions over key U.S. bases and training ranges are nothing new, and The War Zone has been on the leading edge of covering this topic for years. TWZ broke the story of the major drone incursions over Langley AFB a year ago, which marked a major change in how the DoD was approaching this neglected threat. Other such incursions involving UAS have taken place off the U.S. coasts and, as well as military bases, key civilian infrastructure has also been visited by mysterious drones. As we have reported on repeatedly, including the aforementioned Palo Verde incident, drones pose a danger to energy infrastructure and nefarious and bizarre drone activity at such sites has been an ongoing issue. What appeared to be the first actual drone attack on a power facility in the U.S. happened in 2020, which raised red flags in the intelligence community. The large recent increase in drone flyovers is deeply concerning for several reasons. Even small drones can deliver payloads able to cause damage and flying over these sites can provide insights into security protocols and responses, as well as network vulnerabilities and more. While we don’t know for sure that there is any connection between the recent spike in nuclear site flyovers and the ongoing drone frenzy, there is certainly more attention being put on what is going on in the skies over these plants due to a the massive news story unfolding in New Jersey. But it clearly still merits further examination. We will stay on top of this situation and provide updates when warranted.

Ukrainian M1 Abrams Commander Talks Tank’s Major Vulnerabilities,...	Last week, several Russian first-person view (FPV) drones struck a U.S.-made M1A1 Abrams tank in the Kursk region, but the crew was able to survive. The vehicle’s commander lauded the American armor for saving their lives, but also highlighted some major vulnerabilities it has on today's drone-drenched battlefield. In particular he offered important insights on how Ukraine is adapting its M1s to survive — lessons that could prove very valuable for the U.S. Army in future conflicts. The drone attack was 'the first time that the crew survived multiple hits while inside a disabled Abrams,' the tank commander told Rob Lee (@RALee85), a senior fellow with the Foreign Policy Research Institute, and Michael Kofman (@KofmanMichael), a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment. 'Actually, there were 4-6 direct hits. The crew survived, and even without injuries. God bless America.' A video of that attack, by an FPV drone with a fiber optic cable, was posted on Russian telegram channels. It showed the Abrams rumbling down a snow-dusted roadway and then cut to it being struck by an FPV drone, which disabled the tank. The video then shows another FPV drone strike on the left side side just below the turret. All the strikes came within about two minutes, the commander, who is with the 47th Separate Mechanized Brigade, told Lee and Kofman. Russian telegram channels posted videos of fiber optic cable FPV strikes on a Ukrainian Abrams tank in Kursk oblast last week. Aside from a concussion, the crew survived without injury and made it back to friendly lines. @KofmanMichael and I spoke to the commander of the tank… pic.twitter.com/piqapqvVMv&mdash; Rob Lee (@RALee85) December 19, 2024 The crew survived thanks to a combination of the Abrams’ design and modifications the Ukrainians made after learning battlefield lessons the hard way, the commander explained. Unlike Soviet-era tanks, Abrams was designed with the ammunition stored in the hull, not the turret, offering far greater protection for crews. 'Thanks to the fact that the ammo is completely separated from the crew, the crew has a chance to survive (unlike in the T series tanks),' the commander exclaimed. 'The Abrams is a great tank.' A seemingly endless stream of videos have appeared online showing Russian tanks experiencing what has been colloquially referred to as 'turret tosses' as the stored munitions inside its hull explode, sending the turrets flying into the air. You can see an example of that in the following video.

'At least one' of the drones 'got stuck in the net. Two more missed several minutes before. They apparently hit the engine. They were unable to penetrate either the turret or the hull elsewhere while we were inside.' 'Without the additional ERA and 'cope netting' on top of the turret, we would have been smashed and surely dead by now without any chance,' the commander extolled. While militaries around the globe have began integrating 'cope cages' and other anti-drone screens on their armor, the U.S. has not followed suit, at least yet. This tank, which belonged to the Ukrainian 47th Separate Mechanized Brigade, survived FPV drones strikes in large measure because of the netting added to the turret. (Twitter screencap) Twitter screencap The commander offered several more takeaways about the Abrams. 'The most valuable advantage of the Abrams is that, when having much additional armor and a thorough approach, it saves human lives, even in dire conditions,' he noted. 'If the U.S. provided the tanks with the original armor and the complete [M-19 Abrams Reactive Armor Tiles (ARAT)] kits, this would make us more protected (although the top would still remain unprotected and we would need Kontakt-1, etc.),' he posited, adding some advice for the Pentagon. 'The American tankers should act promptly,' he urged. 'Their tanks are too thin and vulnerable given the current threats on the battlefield. Protect your tanks urgently to avoid losses in potential near-future conflicts, taking into account our experience.' A Russian drone operator prepares an FPV drone with a munition for launching. (Twitter screencap) The commander also dismissed concerns that the Abrams would be too heavy, even more so with two to three tons of additional weight from the added ERA tiles. In addition, he confirmed that Ukraine did not receive the latest version of the Abrams and they were sent the export version without depleted uranium armor. Before receiving their tanks, the 47th spent time training how to use them in Germany. The commander said while they were able to fire off a lot of rounds, the U.S. troops conducting that training did not have a full understanding of the challenges Ukraine would face fighting Russia. 'Well, we got a luxurious shooting practice (around 100 rounds fired by each gunner) and some good overall knowledge about the tank,' he explained. 'But the American instructors AND military were completely unaware of the modern battlefield threats. And still are unaware (I communicate with some of the American tankers and try to share information with them).' For example, the commander said his trainers 'are shocked that Russians can see us at night with thermal-vision recon drones (we were taught that we would be haunting the Russians who are blind at night), they do not understand at all the threat posed by the FPVs, etc.' You can see a Ukrainian journalist's report on that training in the video below.

They were first seen in combat in February and the first images of one that was destroyed appeared online three days later. In August, Australia promised to send 49 Abrams tanks to Ukraine. Ukraine has lost at least 17 Abrams, according to the Oryx open-source tracking group. Of those, at least eight were destroyed, one damaged, seven damaged and abandoned and one captured. The actual figures are likely higher in reality because Oryx only tabulates losses for which it has visual confirmation.

'Because of recent advances, Russian forces may capture it.' The commander and his crew made it back to friendly lines on foot. 'It was close to the Russian positions,' he noted. 'We could not evacuate because the FPVs were coming one after another. When I finally could hear no sound, we just jumped out of the tank and ran to a treeline. They were tracking us, so a mortar started working with some more drones, but we crawled away through the treeline. In the end, in a spot still under FPV control, our company commander rushed in and took us away.' Despite its flaws, imperfect training and combat under conditions never imagined, the Abrams tank is a hit with its crews. 'We&#8230;are in love with this tank and are immensely grateful to the United States,' the commander said.

Russia’s Belbek Air Base In Crimea Is Getting Hardened Aircraft S...	Recent satellite imagery of Belbek Air Base, near Sevastopol in Russian-occupied Crimea, shows new hardened aircraft shelters and additional construction to help shield aircraft from drone attacks and other indirect fire. This reflects a broader push by the Russian military to improve physical defenses at multiple airfields two and a half years after the launch of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The War Zone obtained the satellite image of Belbek, seen below, which was taken on December 19, from Planet Labs. Roughly ten hardened shelters can be seen in various stages of construction over existing aircraft parking spots at the central portion of the facility. Another structure, the purpose of which is unclear, but that looks hardened, is also seen being built at a separate portion of the base. PHOTO © 2024 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Additional latticework for less-well-protected soft shelters is also visible on an open apron at the center of the base, as well as across from the other structure that is being built. Similar structures have been seen at other Russian air bases in the past.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION A close-up of the other hardened structure being built at Belbek, as well as the additional shelters or netting across from it. PHOTO © 2024 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Additional physical defenses at Belbek make good sense. The base has been a notably high-priority target for Ukraine since the aircraft and air defenses based there help provide critical screening for the nearby Russian naval base at Sevastopol and also extend this coverage far out into the Black Sea. In addition to drone attacks, Ukrainian forces have employed U.S.-suppled Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) short-range ballistic missiles with cluster munition warheads against the facility. The base suffered a notably destructive ATACMS barrage in May of this year. Belbek is not the only Russian base that faces Ukrainian threats and there have been growing signs of Russian efforts particularly to shield highly vulnerable aircraft currently parked out on open flight lines from attack. Around September of this year, the first evidence began to appear in Russia of efforts to protect Flanker-series combat aircraft, which had previously been left exposed on their bases. While protective structures do exist on certain Russian air bases, the large dimensions of the Flanker mean that these aircraft were never provided with suitable hardened aircraft shelters. The only exceptions were in Poland and the former East Germany, and in some of the European Soviet republics — but not in Russia. In the second half of November, various satellite images published on social media documented the construction of hardening of hardened aircraft shelters at several Russian military airfields. These include Kursk, Akhtubinsk, Primorsko-Akhtarsk, Yeysk, Morozovsk, Millerovo, and Krymsk — now joined by Belbek. It appears that the construction of at least 70 ‘Flanker bunkers’ began at almost the same time. It quickly became clear that a concerted construction program was underway, the scope of which finds parallels with the rapid efforts to harden airfields across Eastern and Western Europe after the dramatic success of the Israeli Air Force in the 1967 Six-Day War. A Ukrainian research project, Frontelligence Insight, provided what may have been the first definitive publicly available evidence of new Russian bunker construction, in the form of a satellite photo taken at Kursk-Khalino Air Base on October 22. Here, for example, excavation work for the foundations, the provision of prefabricated concrete parts, and initial assembly work were all clearly visible.

Not only were critical airfields not equipped with protective structures, but there were no such hardened aircraft shelters suitable for the Flanker series in Russia. A satellite image taken in June of this year after a drone attack on Akhtubinsk Air Base shows damage to one and possibly two Su-57 new-generation fighters parked out in the open. Satellite image ©2024 Maxar Technologies While bombers operated by Russia's Long-Range Aviation branch were moved to — supposedly — safer bases deeper within Russia, tactical Su-24, Su-25, Su-30SM/M2, Su-34, and Su-35S aircraft remained primarily at their operational bases. However, they relocated every few months to other airfields within the operational area and sometimes even further away from the front line. Anti-aircraft defenses were set up at the edge of airfields, discarded aircraft were arranged as decoys and temporary blast walls were erected to protect against shrapnel and other fragments. More unorthodox measures included placing car tires on the upper surfaces of aircraft and painting aircraft silhouettes on concrete airfield surfaces. The tires, specifically, were intended to confuse image-matching seekers on Ukrainian missiles like the British-supplied Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missiles and nearly identical SCALP-EGs from France.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION On the whole, this mix of countermeasures to Ukrainian long-range strikes was largely ineffective. After all, it didn’t include adequate hardened aircraft shelters — admittedly, the most expensive solution, but also the best. With each successful Ukrainian airstrike, the stunned comments and unsparing assessments from the Russian military information space became harder to ignore. During an interview in July of this year, the Russian Minister of Defense Andrey Belousov provided assurance that 'a schedule for airfields has already been drawn up and shelters will definitely be built.' This report was picked up by Ukrainian analysts, who quickly assessed that such a project would be extremely expensive — roughly $1 billion for 300 AU-19 hardened aircraft shelters of the kind that can accommodate Flankers. The AU-19 is a standardized Soviet shelter pattern developed around the Flanker during the Cold War, but, as noted, wasn’t ever built inside Russia. The Ukrainian analysts concluded that Russia was unlikely to make this investment and would instead build shelters made of sheet steel at best, which would provide little more than weather protection. This statement was true to the extent that a dozen such shelters were built in the winter of 2023-24 at Marinovka Air Base, located close together in a straight line, alongside the reserve taxiway. By July 2024, the second construction phase at Marinovka had begun, resulting in another dozen shelters, but this time in a more dispersed form. A successful Ukrainian attack on Marinovka meant this construction work was never completed. In fact, the raid on Marinovka was probably a major factor behind the decision to build true hardened aircraft shelters, with work starting only a few weeks later. A metal hangar at Marinovka Air Base in Russia shows extensive shrapnel damage after a Ukrainian drone strike. via Telegram Another factor was almost certainly the expectation that the Biden administration would allow Ukraine to use U.S.-produced and donated ATACMS to hit targets deep inside Russia. These missiles can hit targets of up to about 190 miles away and their use in this capacity was approved on November 17. Roughly a week later, Ukraine used ATACMS in an attack on Kursk-Khalino Air Base, about 60 miles from the Ukrainian border. The need to provide adequate protection to aircraft — especially for the U.S. military — is something that The War Zone has addressed before. Aircraft shelters with varying degrees of hardening now very much back on the agenda globally, in response to evolving drone and missile threats. There is a growing debate within America's armed forces and Congress about the value of building new defensive infrastructure for its aircraft, as well as investments in new active air and missile defense and tactics, techniques, and procures. With the exception of a few forward deployment locations, the United States does not invest in robust shelters for its combat aircraft. The Russian experience from the war in Ukraine suggests that could be a mistake. At this point, it’s worth returning to the aforementioned AU-19 hardened aircraft shelter. The AU-19 design reflected the Soviet expectation that an air war with NATO would be fought over the Central Front, with tactical aviation moving rapidly forward to keep pace with armored thrusts, with aircraft operating from bases closer to the front lines, as well as from captured airfields and improvised airstrips. A Su-27 prepares to depart an air base in Poland, where it was stationed at the end of the Cold War, to go back to Russia, in July 1992. Soviet-operated air bases in Poland were among those to feature hardened aircraft shelters for Flanker-series fighters — seen here in the background. Rob Schleiffert/Wikimedia Commons There are actually two AU-19 subdesigns. According to the Soviet designation scheme, AU-19/1 is a shelter with classic three-walled external sliding gates, while AU-19/2 has internal hinged gates, analogous to those used in certain first-generation NATO hardened aircraft shelters. However, the new Flanker bunkers now appearing in Russia use a different design principle. For the sake of convenience, we can refer to them as AU-19/3. There are only a few images currently available showing the excavation pits for the foundations of the new shelters, their outer structures, building materials, and assembly processes. However, none of these suggest the AU-19/3 is in any way equivalent to the original AU-19. The degree of protection probably lies somewhere between a classic hardened aircraft shelter and the kind of sheet-metal shelters seen at Marinovka. A closer look at sheet-metal type of aircraft shelters at Marinovka, before the successful Ukrainian drone attack. Google Earth Stefan Büttner, an expert in Russian airbase infrastructure, told The War Zone that an AU-19/3 might just be able to withstand a hit from a drone armed with a 220-pound FAB-100 bomb, 'but anything more than that would inevitably lead to the collapse of the bunker itself in the event of a direct hit.' 'Based on the information currently available, the arched trusses used — presumably consisting of steel profile frames with concrete elements on top and a possible earth covering — give an impression of a construction that is far too fragile.' This leads to the question of why Russia didn’t simply ‘reissue’ the comparatively robust AU-19 dating from the 1980s. The design plans for the AU-19 are easily accessible and Russia has dozens of precast concrete factories whose product ranges reveal their Soviet origins. Perhaps, after all, it was simply a matter of cost that led to the current solution. Still, the ability to protect from lighter strikes, like those delivered by drones and cluster munitions, is extremely relevant and balancing cost versus the most widespread threats does make some sense.

F-35B And F-35C Use Different 25mm Gun Pods Unique To Each Varian...	It's no secret that the B and C variants of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter lack an internal 25mm cannon like the A version. Instead, they rely on belly-mounted pods to provide gun capability. What's perhaps less well known is that the gun pods for the F-35B and the F-35C are not identical and are not interchangeable due to the substantial structural differences between those aircraft. The fact of the existence of F-35B and F-35C-specific gun pods – designated GPU-9/A and GPU-8/A, respectively – is highlighted in a recent U.S. military contracting notice about plans to purchase more of both types from General Dynamics. Both pod types contain a single four-barrelled 25mm Gatling-type GAU-22/A cannon and 220 rounds of ammunition. Some sources have previously described the GPU-8/A as a 30mm gun pod developed for the F-16-series, but this appears to be a case of confusion with the GPU-5/A pod and its GAU-13/A derivative of the famed GAU-8/A Avenger cannon found on the A-10 Warthog. A US Marine Corps F-35C armed with a gun pod prepares to launch from the USS Abraham Lincoln during the RIMPAC 2022 exercise. USN A heavily redacted declassified copy of a report on the Joint Strike Fighter program that the Project on Government Oversight (POGO), an independent nonprofit, obtained and published back in November, further confirms that there are two pods and that they are not interchangeable. The Pentagon's Office of the Director of Test and Evaluation produced the report, which is dated February 2024. 'A podded version of the GAU-22/A is available for the F-35B and F-35C, which is externally carried on the centerline station of these aircraft,' an unredacted portion of the report. 'Differences in the outer mold-line fairing mount make the gun pods unique to each variant (i.e. an F-35B gun pod cannot be mounted on an F-35C aircraft).' As already noted, the GPU-8/A and the GPU-9/A do both contain the same gun and the same amount of ammunition. From available pictures, outwardly the two pods look virtually the same, but beyond that, what the total level of commonality between them might be is unclear. The War Zone has reached out to the F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO) for more details. A nearly 20-year-old General Dynamics briefing slide showing a single design of a podded 'gun system' for the short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) version and carrier variant (CV) of the F-35 (or F-35B and F-35C, respectively). General Dynamics Another General Dynamics briefing slide on the GAU-22/A cannon, shown here in the context of its internal mounting on the F-35A. General Dynamics The podded guns do appear to have largely escaped the serious problems the internally-mounted GAU-22/A has faced over the years. Issues linked to the helmet-mounted displays (HMD) that pilots use when flying all F-35 variants had impacted gun effectiveness across the board in the past, but are said to have been resolved. You can read more about F-35A's gun-related woes here. A U.S. Marine Corps F-35B was damaged in 2021 after a 25mm shell exploded shortly after leaving the muzzle of its podded gun, but the exact circumstances behind that mishap are unclear. That same year, another Marine F-35B, operating from the Royal Navy's carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth at the time, reportedly landed at Kadena Air Base in Japan due to unspecified issues with its gun pod. If nothing else, the fact that there are two gun pods for the F-35 series highlights the significant differences between the B and C variants, as well as the A model. There is only approximately 20 percent parts commonality between the three versions of the Joint Strike Fighter despite their external looks and shared development. The short takeoff and vertical landing capable F-35B is particularly unique with its integrated lift fan, articulating exhaust nozzle, and substantially lightened core structure, as well as its smaller internal weapons bays than either the A or C. The B's design also necessitates the inclusion of an automatic ejection system that you can read more about here. The variant-specific gun pods also underscore the maintenance, logistics, and sustainment issues caused by the very limited commonality between F-35 variants. The lack of interchangeability means that units flying F-35B and Cs notably cannot leverage a common pool, at least when it comes to complete pods. The War Zone has previously explored in great detail extremely worrisome spare parts and related supply chain issues facing the F-35, exacerbated by differences in the three versions, which could have serious operational impacts, especially during a sustained high-end fight in a vast battlespace. The often convoluted nature of the logistics ecosystem around the Joint Strike Fighter has created hurdles even for exercises and other routine peacetime deployments. The U.S. military is well aware of these issues, but has long struggled in addressing them. In the meantime, the Pentagon will have to contend with the realities that the differences between the F-35 variants impose, including the fact that they all have unique gun systems.

Russia Pummels Kyiv In Retaliation For ATACMS, Storm Shadow Strik...	Russia carried out another deadly wave of missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian cities which it claims was in retaliation for the use of Western-donated long-range weapons on its territory. There was at least one death and several injuries in Kyiv, deaths in Kherson, injuries and damage in Kryvyi Rih and tens of thousands left without power on a frigid winter night. 'Today at around 7 a.m., the Russian armed forces launched a combined missile strike on Kyiv,' regional military administrator Serhiy Popko said on Telegram. 'The enemy probably used ballistic missiles. As a result of this strike, debris was recorded falling in three districts of the city.

'The air attack was repelled by aviation, anti-aircraft missile troops, electronic warfare units, and mobile fire groups of the Air Force and the Defense Forces of Ukraine,' the Air Force claimed, adding that '40 Shahed attack UAVs and other types of drones have been shot down in Kursk, Poltava, Sumy, Kyiv, Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhia regions.' 'As a result of the nighttime missile and drone strike, private and apartment buildings, medical facilities, warehouses, and farms in the Dnipropetrovsk, Sumy, Kyiv, and Kharkiv regions were hit,' the Air Force proffered.

Ukraine's State Emergency Service says at least one person has died and nine were injured.… pic.twitter.com/WaLLCqO4u8&mdash; Rob Lee (@RALee85) December 20, 2024 The Russian Defense Ministry (MOD) claimed the attacks were retaliation for a Dec. 18 Ukrainian strike on the Rostov region using U.S.-produced Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) short-range ballistic missiles and U.K.-donated Storm Shadow air-based cruise missiles. The missile strike at the Kombinat Kamensky enterprise in Rostov region was carried out by six ATACMS and four Storm Shadows, the MoD stated. 'This morning, in response to the actions of the Kyiv regime supported by Western countries, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation delivered a group strike by long-range precision weaponry at a command post of the Security Service of Ukraine, the Luch Design Bureau, which develops and manufactures Neptune missile systems and Olkha MLRS ground-based cruise missiles, as well as hit positions of a Patriot SAM system,' the MoD claimed on Telegram. The War Zone cannot independently confirm those claims. The Kombinat Kamensky plant produces rocket fuels used in various weapons ranging from the Kornet anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) to the Iskander-M ballistic missile, according to the Ukrainian Militarnyi news outlet. Though Russia routinely carries out missile attacks across Ukraine, the Russian MoD vowed revenge strikes on the Kombinat Kamensky plant right after the attack. 'These actions of the Kyiv regime, supported by Western curators, will not remain unanswered,' the Russian MoD stressed at the time. The threat of retaliation by Russia was one of the reasons given by the Biden administration for its reluctance to allow Ukraine to use ATACMS inside Russia, a nuclear power. However, after a long debate, it finally gave the green light for such attacks on Nov. 17, which you can read more about here. The policy change was spurred by the presence of North Korean troops fighting in Kursk, U.S. officials said. The U.K. approved the use of Storm Shadows in Russia back in May. This all comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened to use his new Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile on Kyiv to conduct a technology duel with Western-donated air defense systems. You can read much more about that later in this story. The Latest On the battlefield, while fighting continued to rage in Russia’s Kursk region and across the east of Ukraine, little territory was gained or lost. Moscow’s forces, however, are getting closer to Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region. Here are the key takeaways from the latest Institute for the Study of War assessment. Kursk: ​​Fighting continued in the main Ukrainian salient in Kursk Oblast on December 18, but there were no confirmed advances. Kharkiv: Russian forces recently marginally advanced in the Kharkiv direction amid continued offensive operations in the area on December 18. Luhansk: Russian forces recently marginally advanced in the Kupyansk and Kreminna directions amid continued offensive operations along the Kupyansk-Svatove-Kreminna line on December 18. Donetsk: Russian forces continued offensive operations toward Siversk, Chasiv Yar, Kurakhove, Vuhledar and near Velyka Novosilka on December 18 but did not make any confirmed advances. Both Ukrainian and Russian forces recently advanced near Toretsk. Russian forces also recently advanced near Pokrovsk.

'The package includes air defense interceptors and artillery munitions, according to a third source, but the exact contents are expected when the package is announced in the coming days,' the news outlet wrote. Earlier this week, a senior U.S. defense official told reporters, including from The War Zone, that the Pentagon might not be able to allocate the remaining $5.6 billion in Presidential Drawdown Assistance (PDA) funds before the new administration takes office.

Russia is nearing victory, said Putin, for a variety of reasons. '&#8230;the advance is not by 100, 200, or 300 meters. Our fighting men are regaining the territory by square kilometers. I want to stress – every day! Why is this happening?' 'First, last year, and this basically is the classical course of hostilities, the enemy attacks, sustains a heavy defeat, loses a lot of equipment, ammunition and personnel, and then the other side starts to push forward. In our case, this is happening exactly in this way. Combat operations are a difficult thing. So, it is hard – and makes no sense – to think far too ahead. But it happens precisely in this way. And we are advancing, as we said, towards achieving the priority goals that we outlined at the start of the special military operation.' Putin receiving the banner of the 155th Marine Brigade of the Pacific Fleet. (Kremlin) While Putin has previously stated that the Kursk region would be fully liberated following Ukraine's August invasion, he declined to say exactly when that will happen. 'I cannot and do not want to provide a specific date as to when they will be driven out,' he explained. 'Our troops are engaged in combat right now, and the battles are intense. As I have mentioned before, there was no strategic military reason for the Ukrainian armed forces to enter the Kursk Region or to hold their position there as they are, deploying their elite assault groups and units to no avail. Yet, this situation persists. We will undoubtedly drive them out.' He added that he is ready to meet with Trump. 'You asked what we can offer, or what I can offer to the newly elected President Trump when we meet,' Putin said in response to a question from NBC’s Keir Simmons. 'First of all, I don’t know when we will meet. Because he hasn’t said anything about it. I haven’t spoken to him at all in over four years. Of course, I am ready for this at any time, and I will be ready for a meeting if he wants it.' Asked what he would do differently about launching the war, Putin said: 'Knowing what's happening now, back in 2022 I would've thought the decision ought to have been taken earlier. We ought to have started getting ready for those developments, and the special military operation, before.' I should have invaded Ukraine earlier, Putin tells Russians in TV marathon Mike Walker (@New_Narrative) December 19, 2024 He also threatened to hit Kyiv with the new Oreshnik Intermediate-Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM) as a way to test the Western-provided air defense systems. 'There are several types of air defense systems&#8230;such as Patriot and the more modern [Terminal High Altitude Area Defense] THAAD systems,' Putin said, the latter of which has not been sent to Ukraine. 'I do not know if Ukraine has them, but I do not think so. If the Americans want, they can send its THAAD systems to Ukraine. These are more modern systems similar to our S-400 systems. The Patriot systems are comparable to our S-300s, while THAAD is similar to our S-400 systems, if only slightly inferior. Let them send these systems to Ukraine, and we will ask our people in Ukraine to tell us about the modern solutions of these systems which we could use.' That comparative of missile systems is wildly inaccurate by any standards. As for the name of the missile, Putin smirked, claiming he did not know its origin. 'Honestly, no idea,' he said. 'No clue.' Last month, Russia struck the city of Dnipro with the Oreshnik, most likely a conventionally armed IRBM based on the RS-26 Rubezh. You can read more about the history of this weapon in our deep dive here. Putin said the West and Russia should conduct a &#034;high-technology duel&#034; to verify the efficency of Russia's Oreshnik IRBM.&#034;Pick a target for strike, let's say, in Kyiv. Bring all your air and missile defense forces there, and we will strike this site with Oreshnik. Then, we'll see what happens.&#034;&mdash; Status-6 (Military & Conflict News) (@archer83able.bsky.social) 2024-12-19T11:15:53.815Z That comment did not sit well with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

'We have a system of circular insanity,' one of the soldiers groused to the Ukrainian Hromadske news outlet. Instead of passing information up the chain to make adequate decisions, there is a reluctance to deliver bad news because it will result in sanctions.

The barrier, as we previously reported, was made up of nearly three dozen barges sunk just south of the twice-attacked bridge. The extent of the storm damage, however, is unclear. There were 34 barges there as of Oct. 1. Naval expert HI Sutton posted on Twitter Thursday that of those, only 11 remain. He suggested that the other 23 possibly sank in the storm. However, on Dec. 10, the Kyiv Independent noted that there were far fewer barges there before Sunday's storm. 'Recent Sentinel-2 satellite images from Dec. 8 reveal only 18 barges remaining between Tuzla Island and the Kerch Peninsula,' the publication reported. 'The fate of the other 16 vessels is unclear.' The barriers were designed to stop Ukrainian uncrewed surface vessels (USV) from striking the bridge. It was severely damaged in July 2023 by a Ukrainian Sea Baby drone boat attack and before that by a truck bomb in October 2022. While the status of the bridge barrier is uncertain, the oil leaking out of the ships sunk in the storm created a huge environmental disaster. ***UPDATE***Remains of #Russian tankers and damage to defences at Kerch Bridge, December 18, 2024 #OSINT pic.twitter.com/kHXPt4Y0UF&mdash; H I Sutton (@CovertShores) December 18, 2024 It looks like more North Korean 170mm M1989 Koksan self-propelled artillery units are heading to the front lines.

Spanish Typhoon Buy Signals Upward Trend For Eurofighter	Spain is buying another 25 Eurofighter Typhoons, to replace some of its oldest EF-18 Hornet fighters, as part of a continuing modernization program for the Spanish Air and Space Force. The announcement of the deal comes amid something of an upturn in fortunes for the pan-European multirole fighter, which is also receiving new radars and weapons. An artist’s impression of a Spanish Typhoon from the latest Halcón II program. Airbus Juanjo Sanz Known as the Halcón II (Hawk II) program, the latest Spanish contract, which covers 21 single-seat and four twin-seat Typhoons, was announced today. The agreement was signed between the Spanish government and the NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency (NETMA), based in Germany. Deliveries are due to start in 2030. The Spanish government has ordered 25 additional #Eurofighter! Known as the Halcon II programme, the order will cover the delivery of 21 latest-generation single-seat and four twin-seat Eurofighter aircraft to replace part of the F-18 fleet operated by the @EjercitoAire These… pic.twitter.com/gerOdEgY27&mdash; Airbus Defence (@AirbusDefence) December 20, 2024 Back in 2022, Spain had ordered another batch of 20 Typhoons, under the Halcón I program, a process which you can read more about here. These jets will start to be delivered in 2026.

Initially, Spain signed up for 73 Typhoons, although three have been lost through attrition, leaving a current fleet of 70 aircraft from Tranche 1, 2, and 3A production. Like the earlier jets, the Halcón I and II Typhoons will be built locally at the Airbus plant in Getafe, near Madrid. Typhoons delivered under Halcón I and II will be considerably more capable than the Tranche 1, 2, and 3A aircraft already in service. An infographic showing key elements of the Halcón II program, a deal for which was signed today. Airbus The new Tranche 4 standard features advanced avionics, including an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar. For the Spanish aircraft, this radar is the Captor-E Mk 1, which you can read more about here. A model of the ECRS Mk 1 radar from Hensoldt. Photo by Marijan Murat/picture alliance via Getty Images Tranche 4 also has enhanced weapon systems allowing it to use the Brimstone 3 precision air-to-ground munition and full capability with the Meteor beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile. Today, the Spanish Air and Space Force — or Ejército del Aire y del Espacio — fields Typhoons at the air bases of Morón (11th Wing), near Seville, and Los Llanos (14th Wing), in Albacete. An official video showing Typhoons from Morón (11th Wing) and Los Llanos (14th Wing): Next, the service will introduce Typhoons at Gando (46th Wing), in the Canary Islands, as it starts the process of replacing its oldest EF-18 ‘legacy’ Hornets. The Canary Islands are a Spanish archipelago located in the Atlantic Ocean, west of Morocco. These oldest Hornets were previously operated by the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps as F/A-18As. A total of 24 were sourced from U.S. stocks between 1995 and 2000 and were modernized to the F/A-18A+ standard, making them broadly comparable with the U.S. Navy’s F/A-18C/D. However, the airframes are now old and, although they have a multirole capability, they have always been primarily used for air defense. While the Halcón I Typhoons will succeed the old EF-18s in the Canary Islands, Halcón II will kickstart the replacement of the remaining Spanish Hornets. Spanish Typhoons prepare to depart Los Llanos, Albacete, on November 28, 2024, for Romania, where they will remain deployed until March. The fighters were already in April this year performing defense and deterrence tasks on the eastern flank of the Atlantic alliance. Photo By Victor Fernandez/Europa Press via Getty Images Europa Press News These were delivered new, from the aircraft’s original manufacturer, McDonnell Douglas, between 1986 and 1992. A total of 72 were received, but the fleet has since been reduced to 52 single-seaters and 12 two-seaters. Spain’s new-build Hornets were put through an upgrade program in the mid-1990s, which brought them up to a standard that was broadly similar to the F/A-18C/D. The resulting aircraft, which became known as EF-18A+/B+s, featured new mission computers, targeting pods, and AIM-120 AMRAAM capability. A continued process of enhancements under a mid-life upgrade effort has since helped the Hornets keep pace with their rivals, adding the Thales Scorpion helmet-mounted display and a ROVER air-to-ground video datalink for the targeting pod, among others. In the process, the jets received the revised designations EF-18AM/BM. One of the former U.S.-operated F/A-18A+ jets on a mission over the Canary Islands. Giovanni Colla/Ejército del Aire Ministerio de Defensa España While not as worn-out as the ex-U.S. EF-18s serving in the Canary Islands, these aircraft are also now showing their age. It’s notable, meanwhile, that the equivalent F/A-18C/D has now been retired from frontline U.S. Navy service. Back in 2020, The War Zone suggested that Spain might well buy more Typhoons (today’s Halcón II announcement), but a question remains about its plans for the rest of the EF-18 fleet, which will also require replacement before too long. As an alternative to more Typhoons, Spain might choose to risk waiting on the new pan-European combat jet being developed under the Future Combat Air System (FCAS), which also involves France, Germany, and Belgium. The FCAS initiative plans to field a sixth-generation stealthy crewed fighter and accompanying uncrewed platforms, weapons, and sensors by 2040. An artist’s impression of the Next Generation Fighter (NGF) that will be at the core of the pan-European FCAS program. Dassault Aviation Dassault Aviation Whether the FCAS program meets this timeline is questionable, however, and this might lead to more Spanish orders for Typhoons. Having bought batches of 20 and 25 Tranche 4 Typhoons, another batch of 20-25 aircraft might be an option, depending on FCAS progress. At the same time, there is a Spanish Navy requirement to replace its EAV-8B+ Matador II short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) jets — equivalent to the U.S. Marine Corps AV-8B+ Harrier II — which operate from the deck of the amphibious assault ship Juan Carlos I. Here, the only crewed fighter option is the F-35B Joint Strike Fighter.

Photo by Jon Hobley/MI News/NurPhoto via Getty Images MI News With a force of only 13 Matador IIs to replace from around 2030 to 2034, buying F-35Bs for just this requirement will likely prove cost-prohibitive. However, there may be an argument to buy a larger force of F-35Bs to operate from the Juan Carlos I and from land bases, paralleling the arrangement adopted by the United Kingdom. Whatever happens with replacing the Matador II and the remaining EF-18s, today’s announcement only reinforces Spain’s commitment to the Typhoon. In contrast to other operators, most of which are planning to withdraw their oldest Tranche 1 Typhoons, Spain decided to upgrade its 17 surviving Tranche 1 jets. Airbus has incorporated later Tranche 2 and Tranche 3 equipment in these aircraft, to provide a full multirole capability. Re-deliveries of the modernized Typhoons began in 2019. Outside of Spain, Eurofighter has secured follow-on orders from other core customers. Germany is buying 38 Tranche 4 aircraft and another 20 Tranche 4+/5 jets, 15 of which will be configured for electronic warfare missions. Italy is also adding to its fleet, with an order for 24 Tranche 4 aircraft.

Photo by JOHN MACDOUGALL/AFP via Getty Images JOHN MACDOUGALL In terms of capabilities, the Typhoon is also advancing. The Captor-E Mk 2 radar, also known as ECRS Mk 2 radar, has now been fitted in a British Typhoon. This is an even more advanced radar than the ECRS Mk 1 that Spain will receive and includes a unique ‘swashplate’ positioning mechanism to further boost its capabilities. A recent photo published by the Hensoldt company in Germany — part of the ECRS consortium — indicates that inflight tests of the ECRS Mk 1 are also due to start soon. In this case, rather than mounting the radar in a Typhoon, it has been installed in an Airbus A320 flying testbed, within a radome grafted onto the front of the airliner. A German Aerospace Center (DLR) A320 testbed fitted with a radome housing the ECRS Mk 1 radar. Hensoldt In other Typhoon news from today, Germany has decided to complete the work to integrate the Taurus KEPD 350 cruise missile on the aircraft. Germany originally acquired this weapon to arm its Tornado IDS swing-wing strike aircraft and, although trials have been carried out with the Typhoon, it was not fully integrated. Now, the Taurus KEPD 350 will be introduced on operational German Typhoons, as part of the P4E upgrade package. That should see the German Air Force deploying the cruise missile on its Typhoons from 2028 or 2029. As a Taurus KEPD 350 operator, Spain might also choose to integrate the missile on its Typhoons, too.

Marine-Moving Medium Landing Ship Critical To China Fight Put On ...	The U.S. Navy’s Medium Landing Ship (LSM), a platform many view as crucial to transporting Marines among remote islands in a future war against China, is dead in the water for the time being. Reports emerged this week that sea service leaders balked at high cost estimates that have come in from industry to build the vessel. The pause raises questions about how the U.S. Marine Corps will enact its West Pacific, island-hopping concepts of operations, known as Expeditionary Advance Base Operations (EABO), and is the latest delay to afflict the program. Formerly known as the Light Amphibious Warship (LAW) and also referred to as the Landing Ship Medium, the vessel is envisioned as delivering forces right onto a beach without any established port facilities. It would ferry mobile, platoon-size Marine units to islands where they would fire anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCM) at Chinese forces and collect data for the other U.S. forces, among other tasks. Those Marines would also work to deter opponents in situations short of actual conflict, while helping to control littoral areas and seascapes. Such missions would be conducted by the new Marine Littoral Regiments (MLR). They would occur within China’s striking distance, likely in the southern Japanese islands and in the Philippines, part of a sea-denial campaign spanning the South China Sea and East China Sea, analysts say. Navy and Marine Corps leaders have called for between 18 to 35 LSMs that would range in length from 200 to 400 feet, with a 12-foot draft, each crewed by about 70 sailors, according to an August Congressional Research Service (CRS) report. The LSM would provide 8,000 square feet of deck cargo space, carrying 50 Marines and nearly 650 tons of equipment. A rendering of the future U.S. Navy Medium Landing Ship (LSM) and its capabilities. (U.S. Navy) LSM would also feature a helicopter landing pad, two 30mm guns and six .50-caliber machine guns for self defense. They would have a 14-knot transit speed, a cruising range of 3,500 nautical miles, and would be expected to serve for 20 years. But as the Marine Corps continues to urgently relay their need for the LSM, the Navy canceled a request for proposals to build the LSM after bids from industry came in too high, according to the sea service and media reports. Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) officials declined to tell TWZ the cost estimate that led the service to cancel its solicitation for the LSM on Dec. 6, saying it was unable to provide 'source selection sensitive information.' The LSM program is now working to revise its acquisition strategy to 'address affordability concerns,' the command said. 'A Request for Information (RFI) is likely to be released to industry very early in 2025 to identify non-developmental options,' NAVSEA added. USNI News’ Mallory Shelbourne first reported the latest LSM setback this week, citing comments by Navy leadership. 'We put it out for bid and it came back with a much higher price tag,' USNI News quoted Assistant Secretary of the Navy for research, development and acquisition Nickolas Guertin as saying at an American Society of Naval Engineers symposium last week. 'We simply weren’t able to pull it off. So we had to pull that solicitation back and drop back and punt.' Guertin noted that the service had what they thought was a 'bulletproof' cost estimate, and a 'pretty well wrung out design in terms of requirements, independent cost estimates,' USNI News reported. The Navy’s proposed Fiscal Year 2025 budget requests shows the first LSM would cost $268 million, but costs would average out to roughly $156 million by the seventh and eighth ship, according to the Congressional Research Service (CRS). A U.S. defense official speaking on condition of anonymity told TWZ Thursday that initial plans called for each ship to cost between $100 million and $150 million, but that the Navy added features to meet their requirements, and that shot the price of each ship up dramatically. The Marines wanted a ship that was less exquisite and more numerous, according to the official. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) said in April that Navy estimates for the LSM’s cost have 'varied widely.' CBO’s own analysis found the LSM could cost $340 million to $430 million per ship for an 18-ship program, an estimate it said reflects the range of full-load displacements – 4,500 tons to 5,400 tons – in preliminary designs that shipbuilders submitted to the Navy. Marine Corps representatives told TWZ Thursday that the service is currently working on 'a way ahead' for the LSM program in conjunction with the Navy, and is exploring other options that will allow the MLRs to continue advancing the EABO concept. LSMs are seen as a key mover of Marines under EABO, which is a major component of the Marine Corps overhaul known as Force Design 2030 that seeks to ready the service for a war with China. Part of that original vision saw the Navy and Marines moving away from a laser focus on large amphibious assault and landing ships. A more nimble, numerous and cost-effective fleet of small ships tailored to distributed warfare in the Pacific would offset some of the reduced large amphibious warship force. That so far has not happened, and the 'Gator Navy' fleet focused on massive beach landings, which many say are unrealistic in modern warfare, remains intact. A rendering of a potential medium landing ship by the shipmaker Austal. (Austal) TWZ has extensively reported on EABO and what it means for the Corps:. 'At its core, EABO involves relatively small groups of Marines quickly establishing bases of operation in forward areas, especially on small islands. This concept of distributed operations also envisions them being able to then rapidly reposition themselves, as necessary. The purpose is to use these flexible, responsive ground forces to help control littoral areas, and even surrounding 'seaspaces,' to deter opponents in situations short of an actual conflict, and then, if that fails, be well-positioned to engage enemy forces.' In a statement to TWZ Thursday, the Marine Corps reiterated that the LSM is a critical component of the island-hopping mission it expects the MLRs to one day embark upon under the EABO concept. 'The medium landing ship (LSM) is intended to provide surface maneuver direct support to Stand-in Forces (SIF) and the Marine Regiments executing missions on behalf of the naval campaign,' the service said. 'Put plainly, to move a Marine regiment around the Pacific or elsewhere, it would take many C-17s … to move the personnel and equipment that a medium landing ship can move. And that’s without the geographic flexibility of a beachable surface craft.' A Marine sets up defenses during an Expeditionary Advance Base Operation (EABO) exercise in 2020. (U.S. Marine Corps) The Marine Corps also told TWZ that it is working on 'an acquisition way ahead' for the LSM, and that the 'complex requirements' of the ship 'challenge government and industry to design and produce affordable materiel solutions.' For now, the Marines are making do and are leaning on existing commercial and military capabilities that require little modification, according to the service. Those efforts have included Marines using stern-landing ships to inform the development of the LSM in the interim. A June 2024 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report warned that 'existing commercial designs require significant modifications to meet LSM’s requirements,' and that none of the commercial designs assessed by the Navy had the required beachability or cargo fuel capacity. 'Although not optimal, such vessels will provide both operational capability and a sound basis for live experimentation and refining detailed requirements for the LSM program,' the Corps said in a 2022 update to Force Design 2030. The Marines first introduced the idea of the LSM in 2020, but the program has suffered several stalls, with plans to acquire the first vessels initially pushed back to Fiscal Year 2023 and then to Fiscal 2025, as the Navy grapples with hefty bills for submarines and other needs, Defense News reported in 2022. The Navy began receiving LSM concepts from shipyards and design firms in late 2020. By January 2024, the Navy was seeking proposals for the LSM, with Marine Corps officials saying they were on pace to procure in 2025 and deliver in 2029, according to the CRS. Opinions continue to differ on what the LSM should be, with the Navy wanting a survivable vessel and the Marines looking to field the capability as quickly as possible, as some warn that China could invade Taiwan and prompt a U.S. response in the next few years. Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Eric Smith downplayed concerns about the LSM’s survivability in 2023, according to a report by Defense Daily’s Rich Abbott. 'Well, if I take that to the next step, soldiers and Marines, y’all can’t leave the barracks because the enemy’s got machine guns,' Smith was quoted as saying. 'Hey, pilots, you got to stay on the tarmac because there’s anti-air missiles out there. Hey, submariners and ship drivers, y’all can’t leave the pier because there’s [anti-ship cruise missiles] and torpedoes. That doesn’t make sense.' The Commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. Eric M. Smith, right, and the Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. Lisa M. Franchetti. (U.S. Marine Corps) TWZ has reported on leaders playing down the differences between the services on where LSM should head. Despite 'healthy friction' over the LSM, 'there is no daylight between us' on the need for those ships, Navy Vice Adm. Scott Conn, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Warfighting Requirements and Capabilities, said at a conference in April 2023. The latest LSM travails again highlight a longstanding tension between the Navy and Marine Corps. The Marines need certain maritime capabilities for amphibious operations. The Navy is tasked with moving those Marines, but must pay for the ships the Marines need. Similar debates have surfaced around the size of the larger-deck amphibious fleet in recent years as well. The amphibious force is 'not the favorite thing of the Navy to deal with,' according to Bradley Martin, a retired Navy surface warfare officer who spent two-thirds of his 30-year career at sea. 'I say this as a guy who spent a number of years on the amphibs,' said Martin, now a senior policy researcher with the RAND think tank. 'The Marines aren’t very worried about how the Navy sustains ships, and the Navy hasn’t been really clear about what it takes to sustain ships. There’s been that disconnect.' Mark Cancian, a retired Marine Corps colonel and senior advisor with the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank’s defense and security department, told TWZ Thursday that the LSM conundrum is different because, unlike past amphibious disagreements, the Marines want a low-end ship and the Navy is arguing for a high-end capability. Cancian worked in the Pentagon in the 1990s and recalled a proposal for the equivalent to a LHA or LHD amphib built to civilian standards that could be used for peacetime presence missions. It would be cheaper but unsuitable for wartime needs. 'The Marine Corps fought against it tooth and nail,' he recalled. 'I remember Marines being in my office, saying it would be immoral to put Marines on a ship built to civilian standards.' The amphibious assault ship USS Wasp (LHD-1), a traditional big-deck Marine mover. (U.S. Navy) 'There’s going to be some tough negotiations between the Navy and Marine Corps,' Cancian added. 'And the new administration will weigh in too, on force design, on the topline and shipbuilding. But the Marine Corps won’t give up.' In general, the LSM’s concept has not matched its execution, Martin said. 'They need something, and this just isn’t the right capability,' he said. 'It’s too expensive. When you get right down to it, you’ve got to move stuff around, even if you beach, you’re still going to be vulnerable during the period that you’re beached.' The Pentagon should instead be investing in civilian-manned ferries for such missions that would be part of the existing strategic sealift fleet, Martin said. China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) is already at work on such a civilian-military meld. It has been modifying roll-on, roll-off (RO/RO) ferries with stern ramps that will allow the force to launch and recover amphibious combat vehicles in the event of a cross-strait invasion of Taiwan, Maritime Executive reported in 2023. Such a move would give the PLAN a big boost when it comes to the amount of amphibious lift it could summon for such a landing, allowing Beijing to close its amphibious gap without building more military amphibs. The Pentagon’s annual report on China’s military capabilities released this week notes that 'amphibious marine forces continued to conduct routine driver integration training with PLAN amphibious and civilian roll-on/roll-off (RO/RO) vessels.' 'Amphibious marine forces continued to conduct routine driver integration training with PLAN amphibious ships and civilian roll-on/roll-off (RO/RO) vessels,' the report states. 'Non-amphibious marine forces continued civilian-military integration training, with a new PLANMC BDE in the northern theater observed loading vehicles onto a RO/RO and conducting a sea crossing before unloading from the RO/RO.' China has also used civilian ferries to move its amphibious forces and launch amphibious craft during beach invasion drills. Turning commercial ships into helicopter carriers is also something China's is training to do during a major contingency operation.

LSMs won’t be used to storm a beach, or for opposed landings, Martin said. But the requirements include a military crew, damage control and other features that don’t reflect its core mission, which drives up the price. 'Anywhere that ship might go is subject to targeting, but having the type of weapons it’s got on it won’t do much good against the type of threat the Chinese or any capable power are likely to throw against it,' he said. 'It’s not a well-conceived answer.' Real talk about what capability the Navy could provide for the Marines to carry out EABO might have occurred at lower levels, but likely got diluted further up the chain, he said. 'It got further and further away from a discussion about requirements, toward just a head nod that we’re going to do it,' Martin said. 'That is a problem with the Navy’s management of requirements in general. All the services are guilty of this to a degree, but the people generating requirements are not talking to other people generating requirements, and they’re not engaged with the people actually designing equipment, and that’s a big problem.' Even as the Marines proceed with Force Design 2030 and EABO, CRS’s August 2024 LSM report notes that debate about the merits of the two plans continue. Questions remain about whether the concepts focus too heavily on China war scenarios at the expense of other Marine Corps missions. It also remains unclear whether the MLRs would be able to get access to the islands they need to operate from, in addition to resupply and survivability concerns. There’s also the question of whether the MLRs could contribute meaningfully to sea-denial operations, although the Marines emphasize that the MLR platoons would be collecting vital data as well. American military brass portrays the threat of war with China as one that is just over the horizon. If that is in fact the case, the latest delay in the LSM hinders the Marines’ ability to contribute to that fight in the not-so-distant future, given their plans for how their portion of that fight would play out. Above all else, it highlights a disconnect between urgent messaging on the threat and what's needed to address it, and the actual procurement of those solutions.

Syria’s Air Defenses Helped Make The F-22A Raptor A Reality	In the face of post-Cold War drawdowns, the U.S. Air Force pushed ahead with buying the famously expensive F-22 Raptor stealth fighter in part because of a perhaps unexpected reason: concerns about Syrian air defenses. Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall talked about the Syrian connection to the F-22's story during an online talk that the Air & Space Forces Association's Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies hosted earlier today. Kendall is an Army veteran and career civil servant who has held various positions within the Department of Defense and the Air Force since the 1980s, including ones in which he was directly involved in crafting requirements for what became the F-22. The Air Force selected Lockheed's YF-22 as the winner of its Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) competition, beating out Northrop's YF-23, in 1991 just as the Soviet Union was collapsing. The U.S. military spending notably contracted following the end of the Cold War, with various high-profile programs ending up canceled or severely truncated as a result. Questions were raised about the multi-billion-dollar F-22 acquisition program. Northrop's YF-23, at top, flies alongside Lockheed's YF-22. USAF 'The scenario that we used &#8230; on a requirements basis to convince ourselves, [and] Secretary [of Defense Dick] Cheney, that we should continue with the F-22 was Syria,' Kendall said today. 'Right after the Cold War, &#8230; they had [one of] the most modern &#8230; integrated air defenses at the time.' During the 1970s and 1980s, the Syrian military did amass a significant array of Soviet short, medium, and long-range surface-to-air missile systems. This included fixed site types like the SA-2 Guideline and SA-5 Gammon, self-propelled designs like the SA-6 Gainful and the SA-11 Gadfly, and multiple variants of the Strela family of man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS). Part of an Iranian SA-5 surface-to-air missile system seen in 2009. Ali Shayegan/AFP via Getty Images A Russian SA-11 self-propelled surface-to-air missile system. YURI KADOBNOV/AFP via Getty Images YURI KADOBNOV In the end, the F-22 program was still significantly scaled back ostensibly over its high cost and the Air Force only received 187 examples in the end, a decision widely viewed today as near-sighted. It's certainly interesting to consider that Syrian air defenses were once significant enough to drive the development of something like the F-22, which remains the most capable fighter in U.S. inventory today. Syria was actually the first locale where the Raptor was employed in combat, with the stealthy jets striking ISIS terrorists in the country in 2014. F-22s were utilized in part because of their survivability against potential threats from the regime in Damascus. F-22s continued to operate over the country for years afterward to help shield U.S. forces and their local partners from Syrian forces, as well as their Iranian and Russian allies. Kendall's comments about the Syrian scenario and the F-22 came in response to a question about future stand-in strike capabilities. 'It depends upon who you're standing against&#8230; Clearly, we need some of that capability [against] critical targets. It can be accomplished in different ways. You can do it with stand-off weapons, up to a point, but there's a cost associated with that,' Kendall explained, after which he shared the F-22/Syria anecdote. 'Our pacing challenge today is not Syria. It's much tougher,' he continued. 'You gotta take a harder look at what's the right mix and what do you want to do with it. The other thing that's true is that Syria was not a nuclear power. Russia and China are nuclear powers with a lot of nuclear weapons. So what you would do in a conventional conflict with them has to be done with an eye to what are the consequences in the strategic [realm].' The Air Force is currently in the process of acquiring a new dedicated Stand-in Attack Weapon (SiAW) missile to 'provide [a] capability to strike rapidly re-locatable targets that create the Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) environment,' according to the service's 2025 Fiscal Year budget request. Those 'targets include Theater Ballistic Missile Launchers, Land Attack and Anti-Ship Cruise Missile Launchers, Jammers, Anti-Satellite Systems, and Integrated Air Defense Systems.' A US Air Force F-16C Viper fighter releases a SiAW test missile. USAF Northrop Grumman is leading the development of the SiAW, which is a derivative of the company's AGM-88G Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile-Extended Range (AARGM-ER) missile. AARGM-ER, a program the U.S. Navy is leading, is intended primarily to punch holes in enemy air defenses, though it will also have a more general secondary strike capability. The stealthy F-35A Joint Strike Fighter is expected to be the first platform armed with the SiAW, which could find its way onto other aircraft and that you can read more about here. Kendall's comments today about capabilities mixes and cost considerations also come as the service's plans for a new sixth-generation stealth combat jet as part of its larger Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) modernization initiative are very much in question. A final decision on how to proceed with that program has now been pushed into next year when President-elect Donald Trump takes office. The fate of other Air Force advanced aviation efforts, including its Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drone program and plans to acquire stealthy aerial refueling tankers, are also intertwined with the NGAD combat jet decision. The current 'pacing challenge,' or 'China, China, China' as Kendall has liked to say during his tenure as Air Force Secretary, will be a key factor in any decision-making about Air Force modernization plans just like Syria apparently was for the F-22.

Iranian F-14 Tomcat Encounter At An Airshow Unlike Any Other	As the world’s only operator of the legendary F-14 Tomcat swing-wing fighter, the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force (IRIAF) has a unique airpower status. A recent airshow provided the chance for a very rare close-quarters look at the Cold War-era jet, which by now has very questionable capabilities and serviceability, while there are persistent reports that it could soon be replaced entirely by Russian-provided Su-35 Flanker multirole fighters. Živojin Banković, a military aviation writer for the Serbian Tango Six website, shared with The War Zone photos that he took while on assignment in Iran, where he saw one of the country’s last F-14s, as well as other unusual aircraft types, at the 2024 Kish Air Show. Star of the show: the participating F-14A serial number 3-6006 from the 8th Tactical Air Base at Isfahan. @tower_eye, Tango Six In fact, the 12th Iran International Aerospace Exhibition on Kish Island in the Persian Gulf, held from December 10-13, offered what might be the public’s final opportunity to witness the ‘Persian Cats’ in action. Even getting to the event was something of a challenge, especially given the tensions and complex geopolitical situation in the Middle East right now. For Banković, conditions were eased somewhat since his native Serbia is one of just five European nations whose citizens can enter Iran without visas, with Tehran allowing tourist stays of up to 15 days. @tower_eye, Tango Six The 2024 Kish Air Show presented some challenges for the organizers, too. On December 5, in the run-up to the show, an Iranian-made Yasin jet trainer crashed while flying to the event, killing its two pilots, Colonels Hamidreza Ranjbar and Manuchehr Pirzadeh. The highly experienced test pilots had been expected to demonstrate the Yasin and U.S.-made F-5 fighters at the show. While the cause of the crash has not been disclosed, there are unconfirmed reports that the aircraft may have suffered a double engine failure. The F-14 dominates the IRIAF static display at Kish Island. @tower_eye, Tango Six Understandably, the incident tempered the atmosphere at the airshow, resulting in a somewhat somber 12th edition. Initially, the organizers told Banković and his colleagues that there would be no military aircraft present at the airshow. Poised to cancel the trip to Iran entirely, another email arrived just a couple of days before the show was to begin — the IRIAF would participate after all. Still, on arrival, there would be more problems for Banković, as he explained to The War Zone: 'The first day presented challenges for spotters who had purchased spotter tickets costing hundreds of dollars. Poor organization and coordination between the event staff, police, and military security prevented access to the designated airport areas — as had been promised. As an apology, the organizers offered a morning tourist tour of Kish Island on the final day.' Despite these setbacks, journalists and enthusiasts subsequently enjoyed unprecedented access to the F-14 and its crew, relishing the chance to see the operational Tomcat on the ground and in the air — something impossible in the Western world since the U.S. Navy retired the fighter back in 2006. The F-14 might still be the pride of the IRIAF, but the fleet has suffered high-profile issues throughout its eventful service in Iran. The nose of the IRIAF F-14 contains an AN/AWG-9 fire control radar. @tower_eye, Tango Six In particular, the F-14’s once-state-of-the-art AN/AWG-9 fire control radar has suffered from low serviceability, with the Tomcat fleet effectively being divided between those with fully functioning radars and those with more diminished capabilities. The current status of any surviving AIM-54 Phoenix and AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missiles is also a matter of debate and Iranian programs to introduce alternative weaponry for the F-14 have had only very mixed results, as you can read more about here. The fact that only one F-14 was included in the airshow is almost certainly indicative of broader problems within the IRIAF. As well as long-term maintenance issues with the Tomcats especially, the air force as a whole is facing the prospect of a potential broader conflict in the region, so serviceable combat jets would have been required for quick reaction alert and other high-priority tasks. As it was, the IRIAF participated at Kish with a fleet of just 10 aircraft. The static display featured six aircraft (three F-5s and three PC-7 turboprop trainers), while four others participated in the aerial display (one F-14 and three F-4 Phantoms). This fell short of the originally announced lineup, which was supposed to include demonstrations of the Yasin, F-5, MiG-29 Fulcrum, and Yak-130 Mitten, along with additional aircraft in the static display. A Saghe — an Iranian twin-tail modification of the F-5E. @tower_eye, Tango Six The modest IRIAF participation was not only attributable to the Yasin accident. After all, most of the fleet comprises aircraft that are between 30 and 50 years old — if not older. Despite Iran’s ability to adapt to sanctions, maintaining such aging equipment is getting increasingly difficult. This was evident at the airshow itself — the F-14 flew only on the pre-show arrival day, performing a low pass, a turn, landing, and taxiing before remaining grounded for the remainder of the show, departing only on December 14. A planned race between an F-14 and a Lamborghini was canceled due to technical issues with the Tomcat. Instead, the Lamborghini was raced against a civilian aircraft, a Hawker Beechcraft 400XP from the local Toos airline. The participating F-14A (U.S. Navy Bureau Number 160334, Iranian serial number 3-6006) came from the 8th Tactical Air Base at Isfahan, which is home to Iran’s last three Tomcat squadrons: the 81st, 82nd, and 83rd Tactical Combat Squadrons. In contrast, the F-4 fighter, increasingly also a global rarity, fared better at Kish. Three F-4Es from the 91st Tactical Combat Squadron performed impressive formation flybys and solo passes over three days, operating out of their home base, the 9th Tactical Air Base at Bandar Abbas. F-4E Phantom fighter-bombers are currently the backbone of the IRIAF. @tower_eye, Tango Six As it stands, there is a strong likelihood that the F-4 will outlive the F-14 in Iranian service, in an ironic twist. After all, the F-14 was originally introduced as a Phantom replacement for the U.S. Navy’s carrier air wings. Back in 2023, an Iranian lawmaker told media in that country that Russia would deliver the first Su-35 fighters to the IRIAF 'in the coming months.' Shahriar Heidari, a member of the Iranian parliament’s National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, told the semi-official Tasnim news agency in January 2023 that the first examples of the Russian-made fighter were planned to be handed over to the IRIAF in the spring of 2023. While that never happened, there have since been more reports indicating that the delivery of Flankers to Iran could be imminent. It’s widely presumed that the aircraft in question would be drawn from a batch that was already built for Egypt, before the deal with Cairo collapsed, apparently under U.S. pressure. One of the Su-35s built for Egypt but never transferred to that country. via @nskplanes It’s unclear how many Su-35s Iran might be looking to acquire, but reports suggest that the IRIAF could be in line to receive 24 examples. Such a deal makes good sense for Tehran and Moscow. For three decades, Iran’s attempts to procure new Chinese- or Russian-made fighters to replace its aging fleets of F-4s, F-5s, and F-14s have failed, in the face of international sanctions. But Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has led to it being ostracized, too, and increasingly seeking military and economic relations with Iran. This burgeoning relationship has seen, most notably, Shahed series one-way attack drones heading from Iran to Russia, as well as being built locally in Russian factories. With Moscow finding it increasingly hard to sell arms, Iran is now very much one of the most realistic clients. Yet another Iranian F-5 upgrade, the Kowsar, in front of the F-14. @tower_eye, Tango Six While a true multirole fighter, and a generational leap above the F-14A, the Flanker-E is similarly a twin-engine fighter, equipped with a powerful fire-control radar, and has the potential to carry very long-range air-to-air missiles. It would therefore be an obvious replacement for the IRIAF’s Tomcats. In the past, Tasnim reported that at least some of the Su-35s are expected to be based at the 8th Tactical Air Base at Isfahan, where they would almost certainly supplement and eventually replace the F-14s of the 81st, 82nd, and 83rd Tactical Combat Squadrons. For now, however, there’s no sign of imminent Su-35 deliveries to Iran, meaning that diminishing numbers of F-14s will likely have to continue in service for some time longer. Živojin Banković gets up close to the F-14. @tower_eye, Tango Six With Iran firmly ostracized from much of the international community, chances to see the IRIAF’s F-14s will likely be vanishingly few from now on. With that in mind, the possibility of seeing just one of these rare ‘Persian Cats’ at the Kish Air Show is something that will remain long in the memories of those privileged to see it. With thanks to Petar Vojinović, Živojin Banković, and the team at Tango Six.

The ban comes amid public concern about the objects that has grown to a fever pitch since the middle of November when we broke the story about a drone incursion over Picatinny Arsenal. While that story was on very limited but concerning base incursions by drones, it has since grown into an frenzy about drones invading much of New Jersey.

At the same, putting these restrictions over critical energy facilities does indicate the vulnerability of them and concerns that they could be targeted, which makes sense from an adversarial perspective. We have still seen no evidence that this is any sort of an imminent possibility. Still, as we have reported on repeatedly, drones pose a danger to energy infrastructure and nefarious and bizarre drone activity at such sites has been an ongoing issue. What appeared to be the first actual drone attack on a power facility in the U.S. happened in 2020, which raised red flags in the intelligence community. Issued only for drones, the TFRs 'do not impact manned aviation including airplanes and helicopters,' DHS pointed out. In addition, there is no blanket ban on drones, DHS explained. 'There is an established process to request a waiver to fly in these TFRs, should that be necessary,' DHS stated. The TFRs explain that drones can only be flown over these towns under the following conditions: in direct support of an actual national defense, homeland security, law enforcement, firefighting, search and rescue, or disaster response mission. In addition, they can be flown if supporting events or commercial operations with a valid statement of work. The TFR issued for Evesham, New Jersey, one of 22 issued Wednesday across the state by the FAA (FAA) These are not the first TFRs issued in connection with the Jersey drone sightings. As we previously reported, the FAA enacted two prohibiting drone flights without prior permission over Picatinny Arsenal and the Trump National Golf Course Bedminster. The Picatinny TFR went into effect Nov. 25 and ends Dec. 26, while the one over Trump National was initiated Nov. 22 and slated to end Dec. 6, but was subsequently extended to Dec. 20. Regardless of the TFRs, the White House has continued to downplay concerns. White House National Security spokesman John Kirby told ABC News' Good Morning America program on Wednesday there is 'nothing' indicating the increase in reported drone sightings is a national security risk. 'There’s a use for drones and everything we are seeing so far is they are being used for lawful purposes,' he proffered.

Still, the hysteria over drones has grown to the point where the FBI and New Jersey State Police had to plead with the public not to shoot lasers or bullets into the sky at any object flying overhead. The warning was not hypothetical. Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst officials told The War Zone that pilots of 15 fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft from Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst had reported being struck by lasers from the ground since December 7. One of those pilots had to seek medical treatment but was quickly released, but all aircraft involved landed safely. NJ.com was the first to report these incidents but officials say they don’t know who fired the lasers. U.S. Army photo All this comes as drone incursions are being reported over military bases at home and abroad. Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton in southern California confirmed to The War Zone on Tuesday that it had experienced multiple such incidents over its airspace in the past several days. It joins a growing list of military installations in the United States experiencing recent drone incursions, which also includes Hill Air Force Base in Utah, which reported on Monday. Drones have also flown over Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio forcing the closure of its airspace, which we were the first to report. They also intruded on Naval Weapon Station Earle's airspace and several unknown aircraft recently followed a Coast Guard vessel. Drones flying over Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio forced the closure of its airspace recently. (Public domain) Last month, drones also appeared over four U.S. Air Force bases in the U.K., another story we first broke, and more recently also over Ramstein Air Base in Germany. Drone incursions over key U.S. bases and training ranges are nothing new and The War Zone has been on the leading edge of covering this topic for years. TWZ broke the story of the major drone incursions over Langley AFB a year ago, which marked a major change in how the DoD was approaching this neglected threat. Other such incursions involving UAS have taken place off the U.S. coasts and, as well as military bases, key civilian infrastructure has also been visited by mysterious drones. The new TFRs are another indication of how the government is trying to figure out what is going on in the skies, but the Biden administration has just a little more than a month to find the answers. President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, said he believes the government knows more than it is letting on and that the public should be told the nature of these objects. That is assuming there is anything to tell, beyond the military installation incursions. In the meantime, the issue remains cloaked in social media hyperbole, poor messaging, and speculation, with panic filling the ensuing information vacuum.

Putin Claims No Final Decision Yet On Russia’s Bases In Syria Des...	Russian President Vladimir Putin insisted today that his country is still exploring its options for retaining a pair of bases in Syria that have uniquely strategic value following the fall of longtime ally Bashar Al Assad. The new remarks stand at odds with Russia's drawdown of military forces and materiel in the Middle Eastern country already and clear signs this week that those departures are only ramping up. You can read more about what has already been observed at Russia's Khmeimim Air Base and Tartus naval base in The War Zone's past reporting here. A satellite image of Tartus taken on December 17 showing Russian forces massing there ahead of a possible withdrawal. Satellite image ©2024 Maxar Technologies Wood, Stephen Putin talked about Syria and a host of other topics in a freewheeling annual televised end-of-year press conference earlier today. 'We maintain relations with all the groups that control the situation there [in Syria], with all the countries in the region,' the Russian President said. 'The overwhelming majority of them tell us that they would be interested in our military bases remaining in Syria.' Putin did not offer any additional information to substantiate the latter assertion. 'I don't know, we have to think about it [Khmeimim and Tartus], because we have to decide for ourselves how our relations will develop with those political forces that now control and will control the situation in this country [Syria] in the future,' Putin added. 'Our interests must coincide.' 'If we stay there, it means we must do something in the interests of the country where we are,' he continued. 'What the interests will be, what we can do for them – this is a question that awaits painstaking study from both sides.' When asked about keeping military bases in Syria, Putin responded that &#034;many Middle Eastern countries&#034; want them to keep their bases, but that Russia would &#034;have to think about it&#034;. This sounds very much like angling to make leaving Syria Russia's decision.&mdash; Oliver Alexander (@oalexanderdk.bsky.social) 2024-12-19T11:26:36.109Z Yeah, Russia has no current deal to keep its bases in Syria.Every statement by Putin today is aimed at saving face in front of the Russian people when they eventually leave.&mdash; Oliver Alexander (@oalexanderdk.bsky.social) 2024-12-19T12:03:20.541Z 'You want to portray everything that is happening in Syria as some kind of failure, a defeat for Russia. I assure you, it is not. And I'll tell you why,' Putin declared at one point. 'We came to Syria 10 years ago to prevent a terrorist enclave from being created there.' 'On the whole, we have achieved our goal. It is not for nothing that today many European countries and the United States want to establish relations with them,' he continued. 'If they are terrorist organizations, why are you [the West] going there? So that means they have changed.' Many countries, including the United States, have been in contact with Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which headed the rebel coalition that ousted Assad, in the past few weeks. HTS is now working to form a transitional government in Damascus. At the same time, the U.S. government, as well as that of Russia, among others, still formally designates HTS as a terrorist organization. American authorities have a $10 million bounty out on HTS leader Ahmed Hussein Al Shar’a, better known by his nom de guerre Abu Mohammad Al Jolani (or simply as Jolani). Russia was actively fighting anti-regime rebels, including HTS, just two weeks ago. In addition, Putin today tried to downplay Russia's extensive military presence in Syria and any culpability for Assad's fall. Instead, he blamed the poor performance of Assad's armed forces and its Iranian allies for the rapid collapse of the regime. Russia's President claimed that his country had helped some 4,000 Iranian personnel evacuate the country via Khmeimim. Putin also added that he had not met with Assad since the former Syrian dictator reportedly arrived in Moscow nearly two weeks ago. The deposed Syrian leader has not been seen in public for weeks now. Not making this up. Putin: We didn’t suffer any defeat in Syria and we have achieved our goals there because the factions now in power (whom we called terrorists just two weeks ago) actually are very moderate and we want to send them humanitarian aid via the military bases that… pic.twitter.com/X9GBZlEKuA&mdash; Yaroslav Trofimov (@yarotrof) December 19, 2024 Putin on Syria:&#034;There were simply no Russian troops in Syria. We have two bases there - an air base and a naval base. The ground component consisted of Syrian armed forces and some, as we all know, there is no secret here, so-called pro-Iranian combat forces.&mdash; Anton Gerashchenko (@antongerashchenko.bsky.social) 2024-12-19T12:08:07.154Z Russian President Putin said that Iran asked Russia to evacuate its forces from Syria.&#034;We've transported 4,000 Iranian fighters from the Khmeimim Air Base to Tehran. Some of the so-called 'pro-Iranian units' retreated without fighting to Liban, some to Iraq.&#034;&mdash; Status-6 (Military & Conflict News) (@archer83able.bsky.social) 2024-12-19T11:51:07.744Z Overall, Putin's comments at the press conference today strain credulity. The fall of Assad has been a huge blow to the Kremlin with ramifications well beyond the Middle East. This includes the fate of Khmeimim and Tartus, which have provided the Russians with highly strategic nodes for projecting air and naval power out in the Mediterranean, including along NATO's southern flank, and into Africa. The Russian intervention in Syria beginning in 2015 was absolutely critical for both propping up Assad's regime and maintaining access to those facilities. Assad essentially gifted those bases to Russia through a 49-year 'lease' deal in 2017 and the Kremlin has invested significant resources in expanding them since then. Al Monitor reported today, citing anonymous Russian diplomatic sources, that a final decision about Khmeimim and Tartus could come next March. The New Arab reported earlier this week, again citing anonymous sources, that Russia's military could be ordered out of the country entirely within a month. Previous reports have also suggested that negotiations between Russian authorities and the rebels so far have centered on humanitarian and economic assistance, as well as questions about diplomatic ties. Satellite imagery, along with pictures and videos from sources on the ground, have shown Russian forces, including an S-400 surface-to-air missile system and other key air defense assets, already withdrawing Khmeimim. Materiel and personnel are also massing at the air base, as well as in Tartus, pointing to plans for more significant drawdowns to come. A satellite image taken on December 15 of Khmeimim notably showing the absence of an S-400 surface-to-air missile system that had long been in place at the base. The empty positions where elements of the S-400 had been emplaced are seen here to the left of the aircraft apron. Satellite image ©2024 Maxar Technologies The video of Khmeimim seen below, shot using a drone, emerged last week and had already showed evidence of the S-400 system and other Russian assets being withdrawn. Syrian rebels meanwhile fly drones over the Russian air base in Hmeimim — pretty amazing upclose look. pic.twitter.com/Vuuw8NsmCi&mdash; Yaroslav Trofimov (@yarotrof) December 12, 2024 Russian naval vessels left Tartus days ago, but have been holding off shore where they are less vulnerable, but could also support future withdrawal operations. A picture has now emerged, seen below, said to show the Russian Navy frigate Admiral Grigorovich refueling via a tanker ship off the Syrian coast in order to maintain its station.

'We don’t know if they’ve reached the decision to do that, or if they are in discussions on whether they need to do that or not, but that force consolidation that would enable them to depart has certainly happened.' There are growing reports that Russian forces from Syria are relocating, at least initially, to bases in Libya, which would be a logical development. 'Russian cargo planes have flown air-defense equipment, including radars for S-400 and S-300 interceptor systems, from Syria to bases in eastern Libya,' according to a report just yesterday from The Wall Street Journal, citing anonymous U.S. and Libyan officials. 'Russia has also flown troops, military aircraft, and weaponry out of Syria in a significant drawdown of its presence there.' The Journal did not name the bases in question. The War Zone has reviewed satellite imagery from Maxar and Planet Labs that look to show Russian movements at Al Jufra Air Base, Al Khadim Air Base, Al Qardabiyah Air Base, and Benina International Airport. However, these are facilities that Russia's military has been operating from for years now and it is still unclear whether what is being seen represents a significant uptick in activity.

The Kremlin has sought to establish a naval base in Sudan in the past. Syria otherwise continues to be in the midst of major geopolitical flux following the collapse of the former regime. While HTS is working to craft a new government in Damascus, much of the country remains under the control of various other internal and external actors, including Israel, the United States, and Turkey. U.S. and Israeli forces have also been striking targets across the country, aimed at preventing ISIS and other terrorist groups from capitalizing on the situation and former regime assets falling into rebel hands, respectively. In addition, there has been a notable surge in fighting between Turkish-supported rebels and U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in northeastern Syria, and there are fears a larger Turkish intervention could be imminent despite an American-brokered ceasefire. For, its part, HTS, which evolved from an Al Qaeda franchise in Syria, has sought to address concerns that it might try to establish an extremist Islamist state. 'In Syria, we spoke with all the communities, the Druze, who fought alongside us, the Christians, the Alawites, and the Kurds,' Jolani told foreign journalists earlier this week. 'Now, after all that has happened, sanctions must be lifted because they were targeted at the old regime,' Jolani also said in a separate interview with the BBC. 'The victim and the oppressor should not be treated in the same way.' Jolani 'tried to offer reassurance to all those who believe his group has not broken with its extremist past' but 'many Syrians do not believe him,' the BBC piece noted.

Aref TAMMAWI / AFP via Getty Images When it comes to Khmeimim and Tartus in Syria, Putin's comments today notwithstanding, Russia is clearly at least drastically scaling back its military presence in the country and signs are still growing that it could be moving to pull out for good.

Israeli Air Force Strikes Yemen With Popeye And Rampage Standoff ...	Israel launched airstrikes on multiple targets in Yemen, including the capital of Sana’a, during the early hours of Thursday morning, while the Yemen-based Houthi militant group was conducting its own missile attack on Israel. The Israeli raids come after an uptick in attacks against Israel by the Iran-backed Houthis, including two in the past week. Israeli media reports claim that 14 Israeli Air Force (IAF) aircraft were already in the air, as part of a pre-planned operation, while the Houthi missiles were still inbound. F-15 and F-16 combat jets were involved in the operation, supported by aerial refueling tankers and intelligence-gathering aircraft. Armed with Rampage missiles, an F-16 takes off, apparently to strike targets in Yemen. IDF Videos and photos released by the IDF showed IAF F-15s and F-16s purportedly departing their bases for the raids. While the F-15s were armed with Popeye missiles, the F-16s were shown carrying the much newer Rampage missiles. Media reports out of Israel suggest that the strike aircraft took off around 1:00 a.m, with the first wave hitting the Yemen coastal area around 3:15 a.m., and the second wave striking the Yemeni capital around 4:30 a.m. An infographic released by the IDF suggests that the package passed through Saudi Arabian airspace en route to striking Yemen. מטוסי קרב וכלי-טיס של חיל-האוויר טסו הלילה קרוב ל-2,000 קילומטרים ותקפו בעזרת למעלה מ-60 פצצות, מטרות צבאיות של שלטון הטרור החות׳י ברצועת החוף המערבית ובעומק תימן. בין המטרות: מיכלי דלק ונפט, שתי תחנות כוח ושמונה גוררות שהשבתתן פוגעת קשות בפעולותיהם הצבאיות של הכוחות החות׳ים. pic.twitter.com/wDxBoddma6&mdash; Israeli Air Force (@IAFsite) December 19, 2024 The IDF said it 'conducted precise strikes on Houthi military targets in Yemen, including ports and energy infrastructure in Sana’a, which the Houthis have been using in ways that effectively contributed to their military actions.'

The port facilities were selected since they are used to unload Iranian weapons being brought into Yemen to arm the militants. Here, the IDF claimed it attacked 'eight special large ships,' which reportedly could potentially close off access to the ports, even if only temporarily.

The exact type of missile used by the militants has not been independently verified. While claims by the group about the kinds of weapons it uses are frequently exaggerated, it should be noted that most traditional ballistic missiles also have hypersonic performance in their terminal phase of flight. Emergency responders inspect damage to a school in the city of Ramat Gan, after a Houthi missile strike, on December 19, 2024. Photo by Amir Levy/Getty Images Amir Levy As for the weapons used by the IAF in the raid, F-15s were shown carrying the Popeye standoff missile, also known by the U.S. designation AGM-142. This is a solid-fueled weapon, just under 16 feet long, and with a launch weight of almost 3,000 pounds. Armed with a roughly 800-pound high-explosive or penetrator warhead, Popeye has a range of approximately 50 miles. This is by now a fairly old weapon, with work on it having apparently begun in the early 1980s, followed by service introduction with the IAF in 1986. Popeye uses an inertial navigation system (INS) for midcourse guidance, before switching to a TV or infrared sensor for terminal guidance. It does this via datalink, allowing for man-in-the-loop control of the missile for final targeting. The Popeye is usually controlled by the launching aircraft or another crewed aerial asset from dozens of miles away, via a datalink pod that connects with the missile to establish line-of-sight radio connectivity. This allows for adjustments of the missile’s flight path all the way up to or very close to the point of impact, giving the missile extremely high levels of accuracy. In imagery released by the IDF, the datalink pod is shown under a central fuselage station on an F-15B/D Baz, as seen below. IDF Israeli F-16s, meanwhile, were shown carrying Rampage missiles, which are an air-launched adaptation of the ground-launched Extended Range Artillery guided artillery rocket, or EXTRA. Like Popeye, Rampage offers a significant standoff range, reducing risks to the launching aircraft, although, in the case of Yemen, the country has only very low-level air defense capabilities. Rampage is part of a growing arsenal of Israeli air-launched ballistic missiles and other similar aerial munitions, the importance of which has come into sharp focus this year, especially in retaliatory strikes on targets in Iran and also airstrikes in Lebanon. The missile was first publicly revealed in 2018 and has been pitched as an ideal tool for carrying out short-notice strikes on time-sensitive and well-defended high-value targets. Destroying air defenses is at the top of its use case, for instance. The weapon’s supersonic speed presents challenges for any air defenses attempting to intercept it, flying much faster than a cruise missile, for example. That also helps the missile burrow deeper into hardened targets if needed. The missile is able to hit targets more than 90 miles away, its manufacturer claims. An F-16 carrying Rampage missiles on the outer underwing stations, as well as three external fuel tanks and conformal fuel tanks. IDF As well as keeping out of range of air defense systems, the use of standoff missiles — alongside potentially other munitions, as well — reflects the fact that Israel has limited aerial refueling capabilities, which are otherwise needed to support long-range strikes. Popeye and Rampage are well suited to attacking highly defended targets at a distance without major support packages traditionally required to enable those kinds of strikes, removing the risk inherent in conducting such an operation deep inside hostile airspace. For instance, staging a combat search and rescue (CSAR) contingency operation for any downed aircrew, even if the result of a mishap, would be challenging and resource-intensive. So using standoff munitions for targets located deeper inside a hostile country solves a lot of problems and streamlines an aerial operation like this one. More generally, it’s notable that Israel is now regularly highlighting to the public some of the munitions used in long-range strikes against Yemen and Iran, as well as shorter-range ones in Lebanon. This kind of explicit messaging was very rare in the past and is engineered to present niche capabilities that have helped it conduct precision strikes against prized targets even deep inside Iran and, at least so far, do so with apparent impunity. The Israeli airstrikes were the third time that it has targeted Yemen since the start of the current war in the Middle East. The Houthis began their current campaign in solidarity with Palestinians killed by Israeli strikes in Gaza, the current round of which began in October 2023. Security forces loyal to the Houthis take part in a rally in the Yemeni capital of Sana’a, in support of the Palestinians and against the United States and Israel, on December 18, 2024. Photo by Mohammed HUWAIS / AFP MOHAMMED HUWAIS Israeli officials had recently begun to threaten a more concerted response to the Iranian-backed Houthis, which have been regularly firing long-range missiles and drones at Israel. According to the IDF, the militants have launched over 200 ballistic missiles and over 170 drones toward Israel. While most of these have been claimed by Israeli air defenses — assisted by the U.S. military and other allies — 22 have penetrated into Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared today: 'After Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Assad regime in Syria, the Houthis are almost the last remaining arm of Iran’s axis of evil. The Houthis are learning, and will learn the hard way, that those who strike Israel will pay a very heavy price for it.'

Photo by Ma'yan Toaf / Israel GPO / Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu A further threat to the Houthis came from Israeli Minister of Defense Israel Katz, who said: 'I warn the leaders of the Houthi terrorist organization: Israel’s long arm will reach you too.' Already, the Houthis have said they will respond to the latest Israeli airstrikes. Speaking today, one Houthi official said that the group would 'respond to escalation with escalation.' Muhammad al-Bukhaiti, a member of the Houthi political bureau, said: 'The American-Israeli bombings of civilian facilities in Yemen expose the hypocrisy of the West. Our military operations to support Gaza will continue, and we will respond to escalation with escalation until the crimes of mass extermination in Gaza stop and the possibility of bringing food, medicine, and fuel into the strip is allowed.' Another view from the Houthi-controlled Haziz power plant, in Sana’a, Yemen on December 19, 2024. Photo by Mohammed Hamoud/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu Iran — the major military backer of the Houthis — also condemned the Israeli attacks. Esmaeil Baqaei, a spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry, said the attacks were 'a flagrant violation of the principles and norms of international law and the U.N. charter.' According to Israeli media reports, Washington was alerted to the IAF airstrikes in advance. The latest Israeli attacks on Yemen follow U.S. airstrikes against Houthi targets in the same country, although these have tended to focus more on Houthi weaponry, including to blunt the militants’ anti-shipping attacks in the Red Sea. The latest round of airstrikes, coupled with the ramping up of Israeli rhetoric surrounding follow-up raids, suggests that there could be more to come. Time will tell whether we will see a broader campaign, but with Hamas and Hezbollah now significantly degraded as fighting forces, and regime change in Syria, Israel certainly has more capacity for dealing with the Houthis.

Navy’s Future E-130J TACAMO ‘Doomsday Plane’ Seen In New Renderin...	Northrop Grumman has released a new rendering of the U.S. Navy's future E-130J aircraft to support the Take Charge And Move Out (TACAMO) mission. TACAMO is a critical component of America's deterrent posture and involves providing airborne command and control support for nuclear ballistic missile submarines, including being able to send orders to them to launch strikes while submerged. Aircraft that support nuclear missions like TACAMO are commonly called 'Doomsday planes.' The rendering was included in a press release this evening from Northrop Grumman announcing its selection to lead the conversion of Lockheed Martin C-130J-30 cargo planes into new E-130J configuration. The E-130J contract, which covers 'three Engineering Development Models (EDMs) and options for up to three System Demonstration Test Articles (SDTAs) and up to six aircraft in the first lot of production,' is valued at approximately $3.549 billion, according to a separate U.S. Navy release. The E-130Js are set to replace the Navy's Boeing 707-based E-6B Mercury aircraft, which currently support the TACAMO and U.S. Air Force's 'Looking Glass' Airborne Command Post missions. One of the US Navy's existing E-6B Mercury aircraft. DOD Lockheed Martin's famed Skunk Works advanced projects divisions, as well as, Raytheon (though its Collins Aerospace subsidiary), Crescent Systems Inc., and Long Wave Inc., are also part of the Northrop Grumman-led team. In November, Lockheed Martin, via the Navy, released pictures, one of which is seen below, showing the cockpit section of the first C-130J-30 destined to become an E-130J. Lockheed Martin via USN Kathy Hieatt The C-130J-30 is a stretched version of the baseline C-130J cargo aircraft. The new Northrop Grumman rendering shows the E-130J will have a large satellite communications (SATCOM) dome on top of the forward end of the fuselage, similar to the one found on the current E-6Bs. Past renderings showed the dome at the rear end of the top of the fuselage. A previous rendering of a C-130J-30-based TACAMO aircraft from Lockheed Martin. Howard Altman The top of the fuselage is dotted with various other antennas, as well, which makes sense given the robust and secure communications suite the TACAMO aircraft must carry. A pair of spike antennas are also seen under each wing. These are also found on the Mercury jets, as well, and are tied to high-frequency communications arrays. A significantly extended landing gear sponson is visible on the left side of the aircraft in the new E-130J render. This is a unique modification that could have multiple uses, from helping to cool onboard electronics to housing antenna arrays. The bottom of the aircraft is not visible, but past renderings have shown additional blisters for downlink antennas needed to connect with ground entry communications points. The rendering also shows the E-130J's most visibly unique feature, a pair of long trailing wire antennas with drogues at the end for the aircraft's very low-frequency (VLF) communications system. Those antennas are miles long and TACAMO aircraft have to fly slow, steep. tight circular patterns when they are in use so that the tips fall vertically down. This is the system used to communicate with submerged submarines, which you can read more about here. Another look at the new E-130J rendering with the various antennas and other features visible. Northrop Grumman Before the introduction of the E-6 series at the very end of the Cold War, the Navy actually used specially modified EC-130G and Q aircraft to perform the TACAMO mission. The arrival of upgraded E-6B jets in the 1990s led to the consolidation of the TACAMO and Looking Glass missions. The smaller E-130J will allow for more distributed operations from a larger number of airfields. The Navy has also cited a variety of other cost, logistics, maintenance, and training benefits as driving its decision to return to a C-130-based platform in the past, as you can learn more about in detail here. C-130 variants, including multiple subvariants of the J model, are in widespread use across the U.S. military, as well as with allies and partners. The E-6Bs were converted from some of the last 707s ever produced. As noted, the larger and higher-performance Mercury jets currently perform two mission sets, TACAMO and Looking Glass, as well. 'Northrop Grumman has invested more than $1 billion in digital engineering and manufacturing capabilities that will assist in rapidly designing, building, testing, and sustaining the E-130J,' Northrop Grumman said in its release. 'The effort will incorporate Northrop Grumman’s technology leadership in advanced manufacturing, agile design, digital engineering and weapon system integration expertise to take advantage of Day One readiness across the Northrop Grumman-led industry team​.' It is also important to note here that the current plan is for the E-130J to supplant the E-6B only when it comes to the TACAMO mission. How the Air Force will continue to meet its Looking Glass mission requirements is not entirely clear, though its future fleet of Boeing 747-based E-4C Survivable Airborne Operations Center (SAOC) could help meet those needs, at least to a degree. A rendering of the future E-4C SAOC for the US Air Force. SNC 'Today is a tremendous day for the future of naval aviation’s contribution to our nation’s nuclear deterrence mission,' Navy Capt. Adam Scott, head of the Navy’s Airborne Strategic Command, Control and Communications Program Office (PMA-271), said in a statement. 'With the selection of Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation as the prime contractor for the TACAMO Recapitalization Program, we are ready to move out with developing this critical asset. In carrying on the legacy of the E-6B Mercury, the E-130J will ensure our nation’s leadership is always connected to its nuclear forces for decades to come.' 'Our TACAMO mission is foundational to our nation’s nuclear Triad,' Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro said in a separate statement. 'The E-130J will carry on the proud legacy of Navy TACAMO aircraft and keep our nation safe.' With the contract to Northrop Grumman today, the Navy has now fully embarked on a path to fielding its next Doomsday planes.

Pentagon Warns Of China’s Increasing Capacity To Project Naval Po...	China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) has expanded its global reach and moved more regularly and in greater mass beyond its regional waters in the past year as it continues to roll out warships and logistics support vessels that provide the force with greater range. That’s one finding from the unclassified version of an annual Pentagon’s report to Congress on China’s military that was released Wednesday. The 182-page report assesses the state of the force up through early 2024. It doesn’t indicate when the PLAN, which numbers more than 370 vessels, might be able to operate with regularity close to American coastlines, but it addresses other areas where the People’s Republic of China (PRC) is bolstering its maritime power projection capabilities. China's first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning. (AFP via Getty Images) 'These have included efforts to increase the PLA Navy’s distance sea training … that includes in the eastern Indian Ocean and in the western Pacific Ocean,' a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Monday, ahead of the report’s rollout. 'And they also have a pretty significant level of global engagements, including port calls as distant as the Middle East and Africa. So I think that’s a pretty good encapsulation of where they are right now.' As the PLAN emerges as a global maritime player, one that has had a continuous presence in the Gulf of Aden since 2008 via its permanent base in Djibouti, the service’s surface and undersea platforms are propelling this growing capability that can enable combat operations beyond the reach of the nation’s land-based defenses, the report states. In addition, its growing aircraft carrier force is extending air defense coverage for deployed task groups, while its 'emerging requirement for sea-based land-attack systems will enhance the PRC’s ability to project power,' the report notes. 'Furthermore, the PLAN has a sizable force of highly capable logistical replenishment ships to support long-distance, long-duration deployments, including two new FUYU class fast combat support ships (AOEs) built specifically to support aircraft carrier and large-deck amphibious ship operations,' the report states. 'The PLAN’s expanding fleet of large modern amphibious warships enable it to conduct a wide range of expeditionary operations wherever PRC interests are threatened or in support of PRC participation in internationally sanctioned operations.' TWZ has reported on a myriad of PLAN operations in recent years that reflect this increased global ambition. A U.S. Coast Guard vessels trailed four unidentified Chinese warships sailing in America’s Exclusive Economic Zone off Alaska’s Aleutian Islands in August 2021 and Chinese ships have had a sporadic, but increasing presence there since. A PLAN task force in the Mediterranean Sea back in July 2017 with warships calling on St. Petersberg in Russia, in the Baltic Sea, as well. U.S. Coast Guard ships trailed Chinese warships that entered America's Exclusive Economic Zone off Alaska's Aleutian Islands in 2021. (www.twz.com) China’s global maritime goals are further aided by a surface warship and submarine-building industry that is believed to have 200 times more capacity than its American counterparts, the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) warned in 2023. As it pursues a 'strong and modernized navy force' on the high seas, the PLAN has worked to update or replace previous generations of naval platforms that had limited capabilities, in favor of bigger, modern multi-mission combatants, according to the Pentagon assessment. 'Today, the PLAN is largely composed of modern multi-role platforms featuring advanced anti-ship, anti-air and anti-submarine weapons and sensors,' the report states. 'The PLAN is emphasizing maritime joint operations and joint integration with the other branches of the [People’s Liberation Army]. This modernization aligns with the PRC’s growing emphasis on maritime domain and increasing demands for the PLAN to operate at greater distances from mainland China.' Among those new ships, the service in 2023 certified an eighth Rehnai class guided-missile cruiser that deployed with a 112-cell Vertical Launching System (VLS) array that can fire land attack, anti-ship, anti-air and anti-submarine weapons, along with radar, communications and sensors that increased its situational awareness. A Chinese Type 055 warship. (Uncredited image) Also known as the Type 055 design, the Renhai class dwarfs comparable U.S. warships, as TWZ reported in 2022: 'At just over 590 and a half feet long and with a full displacement of between 12,000 and 13,000 tons, the U.S. military, among others, categorizes the Type 055 design, also known in the West as the Renhai class, as a cruiser rather than a destroyer. For comparison, the U.S. Navy’s future expanded Flight III Arleigh Burke class destroyers will be 509 and a half feet long and displace around 10,864 tons. In terms of general lengths and displacements, the Type 055s, are also larger than the Navy’s 567-foot-long and 10,752-ton-displacement Ticonderoga class cruisers.' The service began launch tests of the electromagnetic catapults aboard its third aircraft carrier, Fujian, this year. Once operational, China’s third carrier will allow it to launch various specialized aircraft, 'increasing the PLAN’s power projection capability,' the report states. Go here to read more about Fujian, China’s first domestically produced and locally designed carrier and the first in the PLAN to launch aircraft via catapults and not 'ski jump' takeoff ramps. It is believed to be the nation’s most capable carrier yet and was named in a high-profile 2022 event. China’s carrier fleet, which also includes the Liaoning and the Shandong, were all concurrently at sea for the first time in September. PLAN’s carrier force is escorted by the service’s newest and most capable surface combatants, including the aforementioned Type 055, the Type 052 Luyang III and Luyang III MOD class guided-missile destroyers, which 'will likely be equipped with a planned naval variant of the Z-20 helicopter,' a medium-lift multi-role helicopter analogous to the MH-60R Sea Hawk. The PLAN also had eight Type 071 Yuzhao class landing platform dock ships (LPD) and four Type 075 Yushen class amphibious assault ships (LHA) in its armada as of December 2023, according to the Pentagon report. TWZ reported in August 2024 on a Yuzhao class LPD spotted with a laser onboard for testing. Kunlun Shan, the lead ship of China's type 071 vessels. (South China Morning Post via Getty Images) Meanwhile, China is readying a monster-sized amphibious assault ship known as the Type 076, which the U.S. military now also refers to as the Yulan class. Featuring a large open flight deck, TWZ reported in May 2024 that the ship could feature catapults and arresting gear to support an air wing that includes uncrewed combat air vehicles (UCAV) and other fixed-wing drones. Size-wise, satellite imagery showed it was roughly in between the Type 075 amphib and the carrier Fujian in size. 'The PLAN’s expanding fleet of large modern amphibious warships will enable it to conduct a wide range of expeditionary operations to protect the [People’s Republic of China’s] interests or in support of international operations,' the Pentagon report states. Beyond its permanent base in Djibouti, the PLA is 'very likely already considering and planning for additional military logistics facilities to support naval, air and ground forces projection,' the report states. Countries being considered for such hubs include Burma, Thailand, Indonesia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates, Cuba, Kenya, Equatorial Guinea, the Seychelles, Tanzania, Angola, Nigeria, Namibia, Mozambique, Gabon, Bangladesh, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and Tajikistan. Beijing views internal conflicts in Ethiopia and Sudan, or the Iran-backed Houthis’ ongoing attacks on vessels transiting the Red Sea, as proof that China needs a military that can operate farther from the homeland. China's military base in Djibouti in 2017. (STR/AFP via Getty Images) 'The PRC asserts that military logistics facilities, like its Djibouti base, will be used to provide international public goods like [humanitarian aid and disaster relief] and secure the PRC’s lines of communication, citizens, and assets abroad,' the report states. TWZ also reported Wednesday on the Pentagon report’s section on Chinese air asset development, including the stealthy, long-awaited H-20 bomber. While U.S. officials don’t expect it to be operational until the next decade, such a capability would further Beijing’s reach in the skies, even as the PLAN makes progress on the seas. An expanding and further-reaching Chinese navy will have increasing implications on the current global order, a Pax Americana backed by U.S. Navy gray hulls since World War II. It will see Beijing's flotillas heading further east, putting them closer to critical U.S. territories on a regular basis. How the U.S. will deal with this new reality as its own fleet is struggling to expand its capacity is yet to be seen.

New Jersey Base Confirms Multiple Past Drone Incursions… By Contr...	Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey has confirmed to The War Zone that it has countermeasures in place to deal with drone incursions and that it has recorded multiple such incidents this year. At the same time, a spokesperson has said that these past incidents relate to efforts to smuggle contraband into a federal prison within the base’s perimeter. 'Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst has countermeasures in place to detect, respond to, and deny unauthorized drone use over our facilities, which have standing flight restrictions that prohibit unauthorized UAS operations,' base spokesperson Kitsana R. Dounglomchan, told us. A satellite view of Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, including the prison at FCI Fort Dix. Google Earth 'This year, there have been multiple drone detections, involving attempts to smuggle contraband into the federal correctional institution hosted on our base,' Dounglomchan added. 'We take each case seriously and aggressively coordinate with local law enforcement to ensure the safety and security of our installation. The majority of the drones were intercepted or recovered.' New Jersey has been the epicenter of an unprecedented, but still very nebulous, drone scare that has gripped the public's attention. The Defense Department’s only tri-service installation, the sprawling Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst covers 42,000 acres and is home to five wings, hosted by the 87th Air Base Wing. Its flying units are primarily involved in airlift with the C-17A Globemaster III and aerial refueling with the KC-46A Pegasus. Also at the base are the shadowy C-32Bs operated by the 150th Special Operations Squadron, which are used for various clandestine airlift missions, as you can read about here, while the facility also supports unique VIP airlift missions, using specially configured C-17s. U.S. Air Force airmen assigned to the 305th Air Mobility Wing pose for a flight line photo on May 10, 2023, at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, N.J. The KC-10 Extender seen on the right of the photo has since been retired. U.S. Air Force Senior Airman Matt Porter FCI Fort Dix is the largest single federal prison in the United States based on the number of inmates housed there. It’s described as a 'low-security federal correctional institution with an adjacent minimum-security satellite camp.' In the past, there have been efforts to use drones to smuggle into FCI Fort Dix contraband including cell phones, cell phone accessories, drugs and tobacco, weight loss supplements, and various other items. In one such case, involving an inmate at Fort Dix from April 2018 to March 2019, the U.S. Attorney’s Office, District of New Jersey said that drone drops were planned 'during the late evening hours or overnight when it was dark, and the drones were less likely to be seen.' A drone pilot 'flew the drones from concealed positions in the woods surrounding the prison.' The same account notes that tape was used to cover any lights on the drones to make them harder to spot. Photo of FCI Fort Dix. United States Justice Department The same Air Force spokesperson confirmed that the last such of a contraband-carrying drone took place in September of this year, with no mention of any other drone incidents since then. The type of countermeasures in place at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst was not disclosed, but the need for such systems is clear, with the contraband smuggling attempts described as a 'long-standing challenge.' Earlier this year, the Pentagon announced that the base had hosted counter-UAS threat awareness training for the resident 719th Composite Truck Company, part of the New York Army National Guard. The training was described as identifying the fundamentals of Army C-UAS operations, namely 'better understanding the UAS threat, understanding threat UAS employment, identifying UAS countermeasures, recognizing and reporting threat UAS, and reacting to threat UAS.' While such skills are increasingly vital for deployed operations, they would also be relevant for the defense of the base’s own airspace against drone incursions. Soldiers of the 719th Composite Truck Company participate in counter-UAS threat awareness training earlier this year. U.S. Department of Defense Kevin C Mcdevitt Outside of Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, the Pentagon has provided limited details of drone countermeasures actions that have been taken elsewhere in New Jersey, specifically at Picatinny Arsenal and Naval Weapons Station Earle. 'When we detect them, [we] attempt to classify them and take appropriate measures,' Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters yesterday, including from The War Zone. Commanders at those other two installations 'have the authority to respond appropriately, and we’ll continue to do that,' Ryder added. 'In addition to some of the capabilities that are already on these installations, these capabilities essentially will enhance a base authority’s ability to detect, identify, and track UASs,' Ryder explained. 'So for example, this could include active or passive detection capabilities, plus capabilities like the system known as Dronebuster, which employs non-kinetic means to interrupt drone signals and affect their ability to operate.' However, there are very real limitations as to what the Air Force can do in terms of dealing with domestic drone threats, with a complex set of laws and doctrines restricting how and when counter-drone systems of any kind can be employed within the homeland — something that we have explored in detail in the past. Specifically, directed energy (lasers or high-power microwave) weapons, gun systems, or missile interceptors are not cleared for use in drone incursion incidents in the United States. Alongside these limitations, it’s worth noting the different tiered capabilities (and associated rules of engagement) that relate to the current counter-drone capabilities. This begins at the very lowest end with systems intended to increase situational awareness, typically through passive signal detection and tracking of electronic emissions. After this there are active sensors, typically radars, able to track a drone regardless of whether it is emitting radio frequency energy or not. Both passive and active systems can further be paired with electro-optical and infrared cameras to help with positive target identification. Next in the capability ladder are non-kinetic ‘soft kill’ defense options like electronic warfare, followed by directed-energy weapons like lasers and high-power microwaves, and finally more traditional kinetic effectors like drone-hunting drones, anti-aircraft guns, and even surface-to-air missiles. Ryder later confirmed to The War Zone that the Dronebuster — a man-portable, radio-frequency jamming system — is being issued to Picatinny. Dronebuster equipment is already in use at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, as confirmed by photos showing personnel from the resident 87th Security Forces Squadron training with the devices as long ago as 2020. An 87th Security Forces Squadron airman aims a Dronebuster device towards a drone operated by the Civil Air Patrol during a training event on Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey, Jan. 31, 2020. U.S. Air Force Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst had already been mentioned in relation to the recent wave of drone sightings at bases across the country — something that has happened especially in New Jersey and other states in the northeast. Yesterday, the base told The War Zone that pilots of 15 fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft from Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst had reported being struck by lasers from the ground since December 7. One of those pilots had to seek medical treatment but was quickly released, but all aircraft involved landed safely. NJ.com was the first to report these incidents but officials say they don’t know who fired the lasers. What we do know is that the current hysteria around the topic — driven to a considerable degree by social media accounts and much of the mainstream media —has led to the FBI issuing a plea for people to not fire lasers or bullets at anything in the sky, whether they think it is a drone or not. C-17A Globemaster IIIs assigned to the 305th Air Mobility Wing on the flight line during a winter storm at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, N.J., Jan. 16, 2024. U.S. Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Aidan Thompson 'We are seeing an increase of pilots of manned aircraft being hit in the eyes with lasers as people on the ground think they see a drone,' cautioned Nelson Delgado, Acting Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Newark Field Office, which is leading the drone investigation. 'We are also concerned that people will take matters into their own hands and fire a weapon at an aircraft. Not only is this act against the law, but it poses an incredible danger to the pilots and passengers on those aircraft.' By now, the FBI has received more than 5,000 reports of drone sightings via its drone hotline, but fewer than 100 of these merited further investigation, the bureau says. Earlier this week, the FBI — together with the Pentagon, and the Department of Homeland Security — issued a statement that they have 'not identified anything anomalous and do not assess the activity to date to present a national security or public safety risk over the civilian airspace in New Jersey or other states in the northeast.' The comments provided by Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst offer an interesting angle on the current spate of drone incursions. This is something that The War Zone has followed closely since the initial such reports emerged, including breaking the story of the first reports of drones over Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey on November 18. In the meantime, drone incursions over other U.S. bases at home and abroad show no sign of abating, with Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton in southern California confirming to The War Zone yesterday that it had experienced multiple such incidents over its airspace in the past several days. In terms of U.S. military installations, Camp Pendleton joins a list of air bases in the United States that has experienced recent drone inclusions, which also includes Hill Air Force Base in Utah. That installation reported drone incursions on Monday. Starting last month, drones have also appeared over four U.S. Air Force bases in the U.K., another story we first broke, and more recently also over Ramstein Air Base in Germany. More generally, drone incursions over key U.S. bases and training ranges are nothing new and The War Zone has been on the leading edge of covering this topic for years. TWZ broke the story of the major drone incursions over Langley AFB a year ago, which marked a major change in how the DoD was approaching this neglected threat. Other such incursions involving UAS have taken place off the U.S. coasts and, as well as military bases, key civilian infrastructure has also been visited by mysterious drones. A drone sits on a landing pad during a training event on Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey, Jan. 31, 2020. U.S. Air Force In the case of Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst specifically, it’s notable that this base has long had a very specific drone problem to deal with and has addressed this — with at least some degree of success — using countermeasures that are also able to bring down these drones. The base’s experience is likely to be shared with other installations now facing similar challenges, although it seems to be the case that the New Jersey Joint Base has been dealing with consumer-type drones, which are more easily countered, while any more sophisticated types of drones will present a much tougher challenge when it comes to base defense.

These Are Saab’s Concepts For Its Next Generation Fighter, Drones	Swedish defense firm Saab has presented concepts for a potential new-generation crewed fighter and a series of drones that would be intended to work alongside it. With a long history of domestic combat aircraft development, a sixth-generation fighter and complementary stealthy drones make sense for Sweden, although there are big questions about whether this is a realistic prospect without joining forces with other countries. The future concepts appeared in a recent TV segment aired on Sweden’s SVT channel, where they were discussed by Saab’s Peter Nilsson, Head of Advanced Programs at the company. Screenshots from the broadcast were shared on social media by the Swedish military blogger @GripenNews. Saabs Peter Nilsson, head of Advanced Programs showing some future concepts for Swedish TV.Perhaps next step, a loyal wingman to #Gripen E. And an overall vision of multiple air system components sharing DNA. #FCAS #aerospaceScreen dumps & source: pic.twitter.com/p7QvxXmXgQ&mdash; Gripen News (@GripenNews) December 16, 2024 Most interestingly, the footage includes an overall vision for a future combat aircraft ‘ecosystem,’ with multiple related crewed and uncrewed systems. At this very early stage, the concepts should be understood as highly provisional, but they may or may not reflect design considerations that Saab is already addressing for Sweden’s next-generation air combat requirements. A close-up of a laptop showing the Saab Saab F-series concept aircraft. SVT screencap via X The ecosystem appears under the title Saab F-series and the subheading 'Same brain in different bodies.' From left to right, it consists of a crewed future fighter; a subsonic uncrewed platform with a weight of no more than five tons; the existing Gripen E crewed multirole fighter; a supersonic uncrewed platform with a weight of more than five tons; and a low-cost subsonic uncrewed platform with a weight of less than one ton. Of these, the Gripen E — which is on order and in production for both Sweden and Brazil — is already well known and you can read more about it here. The Saab Gripen E. Saab Saab’s proposed successor in the Saab F-series is presented as a crewed future fighter that appears to be tailored for high speed, as well as low observability. It has a sleek, blended wing/body configuration with a prominent chine running around the arrow-like forward edges, giving it something of a resemblance to the Cold War-era Saab Draken fighter, with its distinctive double-delta wing. The swept wings are cropped, and the fuselage appears to have area-rule optimization for supersonic efficiency. The empennage looks like it consists of outward-canted stabilizers, it is unclear if it includes vertical tails as well. Some of the same features found in the crewed future fighter concept — notably the overall blended wing/body and cropped wings — appear in the supersonic uncrewed platform, although this is shown as being somewhat smaller and it lacks any kind of tail surfaces. Two views of the supersonic uncrewed platform in the F-Series. SVT screencap via X Other depictions of the supersonic uncrewed platform concept include a higher level of detail, with stealthy chisel-type air intakes on either side of the fuselage and a prominent bulge roughly above where the engine nozzle would be, the function of which isn’t immediately clear. An underside view of the drone suggests significant internal capacity, for fuel and internal stores, although no details of the weapons bay are visible. Another view of the supersonic uncrewed platform in the F-Series. SVT screencap via X Captions for the supersonic uncrewed platform describe it as sharing the same afterburning General Electric F414 engine as the Gripen F, as well as some shared avionics and vehicle systems. On the other hand, the stealthy airframe, 'digital backbone,' communications systems, sensors, and AI technologies are all new. The F414 engine as used in the Gripen — as well as the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, and others. General Electric As for the lighter subsonic uncrewed platform, this is shown as being overall much closer in appearance to a ‘typical’ fifth-generation crewed fighter (like the U.S.-made F-35 or the Chinese J-35). It has relatively small delta wings and outward-canted vertical fins. Perhaps the most generic of the design concepts is that for the low-cost subsonic uncrewed platform, which has a broadly cylindrical perhaps slightly flattened fuselage and a moderately swept wing. It also seems to have outward-canted vertical fins, but these are straight rather than swept. Overall, its look is somewhat reminiscent of a subsonic cruise missile, albeit with a longer wingspan. Its weight class — less than one ton (less than 2,200 pounds) would also align it much more with a cruise missile, or a remote carrier — a versatile store somewhere between a missile and a drone. At such a light weight, the low-cost subsonic uncrewed platform could potentially also be launched from the crewed future fighter or fighter-sized uncrewed platform. In terms of relative sizes, there’s no indication that these representations are to scale, and the specified weight classes give a lot of room for differences, especially at the upper end for the supersonic uncrewed platform. It’s also worth comparing both the crewed future fighter and supersonic uncrewed platform concepts with a Saab wind-tunnel model of a supersonic, stealthy Loyal Wingman drone concept. This is a design that you can read more about here. A full view of the Saab Loyal Wingman concept in the L-2000 wind tunnel at the Royal Technical High School, Stockholm. Saab via X Suffice it to say, the wind-tunnel model shares with those two concepts the blended wing/body configuration, especially the chine around the forward edges, and outward-canted vertical fins. It also has cropped swept wings, although these are more complex, with prominent sawteeth on the trailing edges and what appear to be relatively very large control surfaces. It’s worth noting that the nature of a wind-tunnel model means that it necessarily has more detailed features — including weapons bays — and is closer to a potential finished form, while the concepts for the Saab F-series are far more generic. The wind-tunnel model with one open weapons bay. Saab via X However, the appearance of the F-series is itself interesting, reflecting Saab’s evolving plans for its Future Combat Air System (FCAS) program. Confusingly, the FCAS nomenclature is also used by rival British and pan-European future air combat initiatives, and all feature a crewed fighter at the center, as well as a range of supporting drones and other advanced technologies. At the same time, Saab was previously involved with the British FCAS program, before stepping aside from that. Concept artwork showing the Tempest crewed fighter that is part of the British FCAS effort. BAE Systems One notable feature of the Saab FCAS effort is the intention to have shared components across multiple crewed and uncrewed platforms, with the commonality between the unstealthy Gripen E and the stealthy supersonic uncrewed platform being especially interesting. Overall, such a philosophy should help drive down costs, speed development times, and reduce the maintenance and logistics burden once such systems are in service. Based on the diagram of the ecosystem, it would also appear that Saab considers the drones to be very much at the heart of the FCAS initiative, something that is perhaps not as immediately obvious with the rival British and pan-European programs, where the crewed fighter — at this point — is very much center stage. Examples of a Computational Fluid Dynamics evaluation for an earlier Saab Loyal Wingman configuration. This one also apparently features a stealthier engine exhaust. Saab via X Nilsson talks about plans to have some drones that 'will only be mock targets and [will] get shot down, but who might help so that you succeed in your mission.' This points to a vision for attritable drones — ones that are inexpensive enough to be willing to lose on high-risk missions while being capable enough to be relevant for those missions. It’s also noteworthy especially as the U.S. Air Force is now moving away from this idea, with attritable drones increasingly giving way to plans to achieve 'affordable mass,' pointing to force-multiplying drones that offer a good balance between affordability and capability. Some other details of the Swedish FCAS program are also presented in the TV coverage, including an ambition to replace the Gripen within the next 25 years — or around 2050. This puts the Swedish FCAS on a slightly longer timeline than is planned for the British and pan-European programs, both of which hope to have the crewed fighter component of their planned ‘system of systems’ in service sometime between 2030 and 2040. A video for the pan-European FCAS, reflecting an array of complementary technologies, among them a crewed combat aircraft, ‘loyal wingman’ type drones, and a new generation of air-launched weapons: The TV broadcast also makes it clear that the F-series is just one of the options that Saab is studying as it looks to develop a Gripen successor. According to the SVT report, a decision on what the Swedish FCAS program will look like will need to be taken 'within the next few years.' Interestingly the same report observes that having Saab design and develop those platforms is just one solution. Otherwise, Sweden would have to acquire an off-the-shelf solution, or more likely rejoin the British FCAS initiative — or even the pan-European one. One key aspiration for Sweden is that its FCAS program remains financially viable, even if it fails to achieve any export orders. This seems almost impossibly ambitious, bearing in mind the huge costs involved in developing a stealthy combat aircraft platform, let alone complementary crewed and uncrewed stealth platforms. Saab’s experience with the Gripen also shows that, whatever the capability of the product, gaining export sales is far from straightforward, especially when facing off against U.S. rivals. A pair of Saab Gripen E fighters. So far, this version of the multirole fighter has been ordered by Sweden and Brazil. Saab A pair of Swedish Gripen E test jets. Saab One other option might be for Saab to exclusively pursue one or more next-generation stealthy drone concepts, drawing on its experience with the Swedish Highly Advanced Research Configuration (SHARC), an experimental drone, as well as its involvement in the French Dassault nEUROn. Such a path would allow these uncrewed platforms to be paired with fighters, including the Gripen, giving it much greater survivability, while also accessing a larger marketplace in terms of exports. Decisions still to be made on the future of the Swedish FCAS program will determine whether we see any of the Saab F-series concepts progressing as far as prototypes or production aircraft. For the time being, at the very least, they provide an interesting insight into one country’s evolving thinking around the future of combat air systems.

China’s H-20 Stealth Bomber Unlikely To 'Debut' Until 2030s Accor...	The U.S. military says it still does not expect China's long-awaited H-20 bomber to make its 'debut' – unclear if this means its entrance into operational service or just its emergence publicly – until sometime in the next decade. Earlier this year, the People's Liberation Army Air Force's (PLAAF) deputy commander was quoted as saying the unveiling of the aircraft, at least, would be coming 'soon.' There have been reports for years now that the bomber, expected to be a stealthy flying wing design broadly reminiscent externally of the U.S. B-2 Spirit, could be about to break cover. A general assessment of the state of the H-20 bomber program is included in the U.S. military's latest annual report to Congress on Chinese military developments. The Pentagon released an unclassified version of the report today, which also says that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is still developing a stealthy medium-ranged bomber referred to in the past as the JH-XX. The 2021 PLAAF recruitment video below teases the forthcoming H-20 at the very end. 'The PLAAF is seeking to extend its power projection capability with the development of a new H-20 stealth strategic bomber, with official PRC state media stating that this new stealth bomber will have a nuclear mission in addition to filling conventional roles,' the report states. 'The PLAAF is developing new medium- and long-range stealth bombers to strike regional and global targets.' 'The PRC is developing a new generation of long-range bombers, likely named the H-20. The H-20, which may debut sometime in the next decade, will have a range of more than 10,000 km [nearly 6,214 miles], enabling the PLAAF to cover the Second Island Chain and into the western region of the Pacific,' another section of the report says 'The H-20 bomber’s range could be extended to cover the globe with aerial refueling. It is expected to employ conventional and nuclear weaponry and feature a stealthy design.' The 'Second Island Chain' mentioned here refers to an area of the Pacific to the west of a boundary that stretches between Japan and eastern Indonesia and includes the U.S. territory of Guam. The remarks here about the H-20 are also largely identical to what the Pentagon included in its China report last year.

DOD A map giving a general look at the First and Second Island Chain boundaries in the Western Pacific. DOD 'Unfortunately, I can't really go beyond what appears in the [new China report],' a senior U.S. defense official also said at media pre-briefing earlier this week in response to a question from The War Zone's Howard Altman about Chinese bombers. 'As you can imagine, we do try to make available as much information as we can, but I'm not able to go beyond what's in the report for now.' An official rendering of a stealthy flying-wing type aircraft, possibly meant to reflect the H-20, as seen in a 2021 PLAAF recruiting video. YouTube capture The latest comments on the H-20 are also in line with what a U.S. intelligence official told multiple outlets about the bomber earlier this year. 'The thing with the H-20 is when you actually look at the system design, it's probably nowhere near as good as U.S. LO [low observable; stealthy] platforms, particularly more advanced ones that we have coming down,' the intelligent official said during a briefing in April, according to Defense One. 'They've run into a lot of engineering design challenges, in terms of how do you actually make that system capability function in a similar way to a B-2 or B-21.' The H-20 has long been expected to be externally similar, at least in broad strokes, to the B-2 seen here. USAF 'Not really,' that individual also said when asked if the H-20 presented a concern to the U.S. military, according to Breaking Defense. A month before, the Chinese state-owned Hong Kong Commercial Daily newspaper had published an interview with Lt. Gen. Wang Wei, deputy commander of the PLAAF, where he was quoted as saying 'it's [the H-20] coming soon, just wait!' Lt. Gen. Wang should not be confused with People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) Lt. Cdr. Wang Wei, who died in 2001 while flying a J-8D Finback fighter after colliding with a U.S. Navy EP-3E Aries II spy plane, which caused a major international incident you can read more about here. 'There is no bottleneck [in the H-20's development], it can be solved,' Lt. Gen. Wang also said, according to the Hong Kong Commercial Daily. 'Our scientific researchers are now very good and all have this capability.' Development of the H-20 is understood to date back to at least the early 2000s. The Xi’an Aircraft Industrial Corporation (XAC), a subsidiary of the state-run Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), has been leading the project. XAC is also responsible for the many variants of the H-6 bomber, the original version of which was a license-built copy of the Soviet Tupolev Tu-16 Badger, as well as the Y-20 cargo plane, among other designs. Versions of the H-6 make up the PLA's current long-range aerial strike capabilities. An H-6 series missile carrier aircraft. Japanese Ministry of Defense No official imagery of the H-20 design has emerged to date, though the PLA and AVIC have teased the design for years now. This includes a 2018 AVIC promotional video that aped Northrop Grumman’s famous 2015 Superbowl ad (seen below) teasing what became known as the B-21 Raider. Images of wind tunnel models that could be related to the H-20 program or tangential designs, as well as a slew of speculative fan renderings, have also appeared online in the past. Past reports have also said the H-20 requirements call for a design capable of carrying up to 10 tons of ordnance, including land-attack and anti-ship cruise missiles, and an unrefueled range of around 5,000 miles (roughly 8,000 kilometers). Information about the regionally-focused JH-XX, which would have a shorter range and smaller payload capacity than the H-20, is even more scant. You can read more about what is known about that project, which AVIC subsidiary Shenyang Aircraft Corporation, better known for its fighters like the stealthy J-35, may be leading, here. A picture that has previously emerged showing a model of a design that might be tied to work on the JH-XX. Chinese internet As The War Zone has highlighted in the past, the H-20 would give the PLA a long-range nuclear-capable aerial strike capability well beyond what it currently possesses with even the latest versions of the H-6 family. That, in turn, would offer the ability to hold entirely new swaths of targets across the Indo-Pacific region, including the highly strategic outlying territory of Guam, Hawaii, and even parts of the continental United States, at risk. The PLA has already been working in recent years to expand its ability to conduct long-range aerial strikes with H-6 variants. This includes versions capable of launching very large payloads like air-launched ballistic and hypersonic missiles to significantly extend their reach. An H-6N missile carrier aircraft is seen here carrying a very large air-launched ballistic missile (as highlighted by the red arrow). Chinese internet In July of this year, a pair of H-6K missile carrier aircraft flew in international airspace near Alaska for the first time ever as part of a joint long-range aerial patrol with Russian forces. However, given the stated maximum range of the H-6K, which is also not capable of being refueled in flight, it is likely that those aircraft conducted their sorties from Russian bases. This underscores the continued limitations of the bulk of the H-6 series, though versions capable of being refueled in mid-air are increasingly being fielded, and the importance of the forthcoming H-20. H-6s are also not low-observable (stealthy) aircraft while potential air defense threats are only expanding. China and Russia conduct joint air strategic patrol over Bering Sea on July 25.

As we've written previously: 'With this range, the JH-XX would still have the ability to challenge strategic type targets, such as U.S. military facilities in Japan and possibly even on Guam, as well as bases in India, the South China Sea and beyond. The design could prioritize speed, as well as stealth, too. This could give the smaller fighter-bomber added advantages when it comes to sortie rates and for successfully penetrating through an enemy’s integrated air defense network. Above all else, it allows for multi-role operations, including supporting long-range air-to-air missions, without a heavy reliance on vulnerable tankers or even the use of coastal airfields, which would be the most vulnerable to attack during an all-out conflict.' When it comes to the H-20, even after a public debut, the PLA would need time to develop a true operational capability with the bombers. Unlike the U.S. Air Force, the PLA still has at best limited experience with very long-range air operations. This is something that the Chinese look to be trying to rectify now through more regular longer-range H-6 flights, particularly in cooperation with Russia. Aerial refueling capacity, which would be key to the H-20 reaching its full potential, is another area where China's armed forces are still lagging behind the United States, though efforts are underway to change that. 'The biggest…challenge for the Chinese side is actually not so much capability of actual systems, it's more capability of personnel to effectively employ those systems at speed and at scale. We, as a U.S. military, have a lot of experience fighting wars,' the aforementioned U.S. intelligence official who spoke on H-20 also said back in April per Defense One. 'And yes, you talk to any operator, and they'll tell you all the problems we have, but quite frankly, we're able to figure out how to execute kill chains. The Chinese don't really have anybody right now at all, in the PLA, who's actually been in a war.' At the same time, 'I don't want to rely on the Chinese not being good,' they cautioned at the time. 'Because we're not going to know they're not good until they're shooting at us, and I don't want to be in a position where I find out, Oh, they actually are that good.' As The War Zone regularly notes, the PLA continues to make significant strides in the development and fielding of increasingly more modern capabilities across all domains, including in space. This includes significant work on the aerial side, especially in regard to stealthy flying wing-type uncrewed combat air vehicles (UCAV) and other advanced drones. UCAVs are an area where the U.S. military continues to be absent, at least that we know of, despite an increasingly global resurgence of work on such designs. The U.S. military does say China is still actively pursuing both the H-20 and the JH-XX, even though they are still likely years away from becoming a reality.

Pentagon’s Assessment Of North Koreans Fighting In Kursk, Rate At...	Pentagon officials provided their latest assessment of the state of play on the battlefield, the role of North Korean troops in Kursk, and how what’s left of nearly $7 billion in funding for Ukraine could be allocated in the waning days of the Biden administration. Though Ukraine is losing ground in the east, especially around the key logistical hub of Pokrovsk, it would take several years before Russia could capture the entire Donetsk region based on the current pace of the conflict, a senior military official told The War Zone Tuesday afternoon. Meanwhile, Ukraine can hold its Kursk salient for at least the next few months despite increasing Russian pressure and the influx of North Korean special operations troops who are starting to take heavy casualties there, the official said. A North Korean soldier in Russia's Kursk region. (Via Twitter) As we previously noted, Pokrovsk remains a key tactical gridpoint for both sides, with most Russian advances toward the Ukrainian-held city coming from the south. 'The Ukrainians have been ceding some of that terrain and falling back to more defensible positions,' the official explained. 'So while the Russian soldiers have made significant progress&#8230;it's very short amounts of progress. And as Ukrainians get to more defensible positions, we think they'll be able to shore up the defenses and last for some amount of time defending Pokrovsk depending on how events on the battlefield play out.'

(Photo by Roman PILIPEY / AFP) ROMAN PILIPEY Despite months of bloody assaults, the city remains in Ukrainian hands. Its fall would have significant economic and tactical implications for Kyiv, the official surmised. The city has a 'fair amount of precious metals and minerals and things that are important to the Ukrainian economy over the long term,' the official pointed out. More immediately, Pokrovsk provides key lines of communication, allowing Ukrainian troops to maneuver in the region. Despite its importance, losing Pokrovsk would not necessarily spell doom for Ukraine’s defense. 'Just because they take Pokrovsk doesn't mean Donetsk falls,' said the official. 'There's a number of defensive lines after that. Even if they sustain their current rate of advance, it would take a couple of years for them to take Donetsk completely. That rate of advance could change one way or another. but just doing the math that's about what it would take right now.' There has been concern that losing Pokrovsk would cause Ukrainian lines in the area to buckle further, potentially creating an opening for Russia to thrust deeper toward Dnipro, another major industrialized region. 'It would be very important for the Ukrainians to hold onto' Dnipro, the official stated, adding that 'it is impossible to tell' which direction Russian troops would go if they did capture Pokrovsk. 'I think they are certainly focused on the tactical situation at hand there.' Pokrovsk is a key city for both sides. (Google Earth) The long grind toward Pokrovsk is taking a toll on Russia, the senior military official explained. The fight there is contributing significantly to Russia sustaining what the official said was about 1,200 casualties per day. That's a staggering figure putting pressure on Moscow’s long-term capability to keep up the fight at its current tempo in Ukraine. 'I've seen no indications that they're unable to regenerate' their troop strength, the official suggested of the Russians. 'So they do continue to regenerate. I don't think that can last forever, though. While they may be able to do that now, we certainly know that that's one of the concerns that they would have on how long [they could] sustain that regeneration over time. It's inevitable, quite frankly, that if they continue to sustain that level of casualty, eventually they have to look at another mobilization, which obviously would be a large political decision.' Meanwhile, 225 miles to the northwest, North Korean troops are adding to the pressure Ukraine faces in trying to hold onto what’s left of the 500 square miles of territory it captured in its August invasion. The Pentagon is seeing 'independent maneuver from the DPRK forces,' the senior military official stated, using the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea acronym preferred by Pyongyang. 'There is a lot of integration with Russian maneuver units up there as well.' The following video shows some of those troops in action. North Korean infantry attacks Ukrainian positions in Kursk. This is yet another confirmation that it is not just 'Ukrainian probelm.' When dictators joined to destroy a sovereign democratic country, it becomes the problem for the entire world. Because the next question is who is… pic.twitter.com/yUZ4zufo2e&mdash; Roman Sheremeta (@rshereme) December 14, 2024 The North Koreans are being used 'as small, light infantry… and a little bit of indirect fire usage with mortar platoons. and things of that nature that they've been employing. As far as the capabilities they're consistent with what you would think they would have, their lower caliber indirect fire capability, and then direct fire capability, and obviously the kind of communications equipment that you would expect.' Their complete lack of previous combat experience is contributing to increasing casualties, the senior military official pointed out. 'They're definitely up on the front line. They're taking casualties. Based on the latest understanding that we have as of this afternoon, we're looking at several hundred casualties…everything from wounds, up to being [killed in action] KIA.' That concurs with what Ukraine's Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR) previously reported. You can see some of those casualties in the following video.

'I don't want to get too specific, but it would be all the way from the very bottom to very near to the top. Based on some of the targets that the Ukrainians [have hit] which have been command and control nodes, etc, you can understand what types of leaders might be in those locations.' As we previously noted, a North Korean general was said to have been wounded last month in a Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missile attack on a headquarters in Kursk. The incident was reportedly captured by a Ukrainian drone unit, which you can see in the following video. It is unclear at this time whether North Korea intends to bolster its presence of about 12,000 troops in Russia, the senior military official posited. 'I don't think we have any particularly good insights on if [Russian President Vladimir Putin has] asked for additional DPRK troops or whether [North Korean leader] Kim [Jong-un] has agreed or rejected that. We're obviously watching it closely and looking for indicators of that, such as troops getting prepared to move out of North Korea, etc, things that we can pick up from a variety of intelligence sources, but we don't have any real good indication one way or the other on that.' The Pentagon has more clarity, however, on Ukraine’s ability to maintain a significant presence in Kursk. 'It will be some time before the forces that the Russians have brought to bear there would be able to reduce that salient in any meaningful way,' the senior military official posited. 'The Ukrainians have been adjusting their long-range strikes and changes to U.S. policy now allow the Ukrainians to use U.S.-provided munitions and Western-provided munitions into Russia. Ukraine has conducted a number of [U.S.-produced Army Tactical Missile System short-range ballistic missile] ATACMS and other strikes with long-range munitions into Russia. Those have been successful at the tactical level. We're evaluating their operational effects, but we've certainly seen some benefits from those up front.' Ukraine has used U.S.-donated Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) short-range ballistic missiles to strike targets within Russia’s borders. (Via Twitter) via X Still, 'the Russians have made up significant ground in Kursk,' said the official, adding that 'it will be a hard fight for the Ukrainians to hold what they have. I have no doubt that they can hold it for a period of time that extends at least a few months into the future.' The senior military official agreed with previous reports that Ukraine has lost about 40% of the territory captured in Kursk during two major counter-operations. 'I don't have an exact percentage I can give you, but it has been a significant loss, and that is not an unreasonable estimate that you provided,' the senior military official told The War Zone, adding that a 'number of factors' will determine Ukraine’s ability to hold onto what it has taken in Kursk. 'It will depend on the effectiveness of the long-range strikes that the Ukrainians are conducting,' the senior military official explained. 'How effective are those? Do they pick the right targets, etc? And will depend on the performance really, of the individual soldiers on each side on the battlefield who will be learning every single day and getting better as they work to survive and fight there.' Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff Another huge factor in Ukraine holding on to territory will be how much support it will receive from the U.S. and its allies. With Donald Trump set to take office on Jan. 20, the Pentagon is scrambling to allocate about $6.8 billion in funds before they could dry up under the next administration. About $1.22 billion is left in the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) funding pool used to purchase weapons from manufacturers, a senior defense official told reporters Tuesday. The Pentagon anticipates spending those funds before the end of the year, that official added. Among other weapons, the money has been allocated to purchase interceptors for Patriot air defense systems and National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS) donated to Ukraine. The Biden administration has used USAI funds to provide Ukraine with Patriot and NASAMS interceptors. (Raytheon/Kongsberg Defense) Another $5.6 billion is left in the Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) pool of money that replaces items provided to Ukraine from U.S. stocks, the senior defense official explained, adding that it is unlikely that the entire amount will be spent before Trump takes office. 'We will continue to do drawdown packages for the remainder of this administration,' the senior defense official told reporters. 'But $5.6 billion is a substantial amount of authority, so I would certainly anticipate that there could be remaining authority that would transition and be available for the next administration to use.' Whether that happens remains a huge question. As we previously reported, Trump has promised to end the war quickly but hasn’t offered specifics. Vice President-elect JD Vance has repeatedly criticized the Biden administration's funding of Ukraine and called for freezing the frontlines where they are while others in Trump’s inner circle are more supportive of Kyiv. So in addition to losses piling up for both sides, Ukraine and Russia face another common challenge - the uncertainty of plans by a new administration.

Navy’s Cruiser Modernization A Lesson In How Not To Run Such A Pr...	A government watchdog report released Tuesday highlights problems in the U.S. Navy’s yearslong, multi-billion dollar Ticonderoga class cruiser modernization program. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) report sheds new light on the systemic issues that have plagued the effort, such as lax contractor oversight and a lack of understanding regarding what kind of work the ships would need before they could return to the fleet. At the same time, the GAO report highlights the corrosive effect of deferred maintenance and warns that the Navy hasn’t sufficiently codified reforms to prevent such a boondoggle from happening again, particularly as it embarks on an ambitious $10 billion modernization program for 23 ships in its Arleigh Burke class destroyer fleet. The U.S. Navy spent nearly $4 billion modernizing seven of its aging Ticonderogas over the past decade, according to the GAO. But only three of the large surface combatants will complete the modernization process, and none of those will gain an extra five years of service life as originally envisioned. Nearly half that money spent, $1.84 billion, was 'wasted' modernizing four cruisers that never returned to sea and were retired by the Navy. A graphic from a Government Accountability Office report on Navy cruiser modernization showcases how few cruisers the Navy has actually modernized. (Government Accountability Office) For the cost and relatively short extra service life of its three modernized cruisers, the service could have nearly bought two brand-new destroyers. 'While it is too late to salvage the cruiser modernization effort, failure to learn critical lessons poses risk to the future of the Navy’s surface fleet as it begins significant modernization efforts for other ship classes,' the report states. 'This is particularly true for DDG Modernization 2.0 and the amphibious ship service life extension and modernization. While some issues were unique to the cruiser effort, we observed shortfalls that span across the planning and execution of Navy ship maintenance and modernization periods.' The Ticondergoas carry Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAM) and serve as air and defense batteries and command and control platforms. They are also equipped with Harpoon anti-ship missiles, MH-60R Sea Hawk helicopters and execute anti-submarine warfare operations. They were built in the 1980s and early 1990s and act as the central node in the carrier strike group’s air and missile defense architecture, with their unique capacity to host the air defense commander of the strike group. The Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Cape St. George (CG-71) fires a missile. (U.S. Navy) There are nine cruisers still serving in the Navy today. Six are slated to be decommissioned in the coming years, while the other three–USS Gettysburg (CG-64), USS Chosin (CG-65) and USS Cape St. George (CG-71)-have been modernized or are close to finishing modernization and will serve out toward the end of the decade. As TWZ reported last month, modernization has included Aegis Combat System improvements, a new AN/SPQ-9B radar and upgrades to the existing AN/SPY-1B, as well as an updated SQQ-89A(V)15 sonar suite, Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) modifications, and other work. Gettysburg entered the Middle Eastern waters of U.S. Central Command this week along with the rest of the USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75) carrier strike group, where it will perform air defense functions in a region that has been plagued by Iranian-backed Houthi rebel missile and drone attacks for the past year. The Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75) underway in 2022. (U.S. Navy) Chosin completed modernization and sea trials in early 2024, and the Navy plans to deploy it once more before its planned retirement in Fiscal 2027. Work on Cape St. George continues, with the Navy planning sea trials for this fiscal year, which began Oct. 1. 'Like USS Gettysburg and USS Chosin, the Navy currently plans to deploy USS Cape St. George at least once before divesting the ship in fiscal year 2027, according to senior Navy officials,' the report states, adding that the Navy now plans to decommission all three ships by Fiscal 2030. The Navy has been working to have Flight III Arleigh Burke class destroyers take on the air defense command role of cruisers, but to date, the service only has one Flight III destroyer, and questions have been raised about the viability of having a 'maxed out' subclass of destroyers serving in such a capacity, TWZ previously reported. The GAO notes that the new Flight IIIs are facing 'significant delivery delays,' with some ships falling more than two years behind schedule. The U.S. Navy's first Flight III Arleigh Burke class destroyer, USS Jack Lucas (DDG-125). (U.S. Navy) TWZ has covered the fits and starts of the Navy’s cruiser modernization program, and Tuesday’s GAO report highlights the broader systemic failings that led to it. The Navy plans to divest its three modernized cruisers 'without fully assessing the implications to its force structure, including costs, benefits and risks,' according to the GAO, and the service will look to squeeze one more deployment out of those three ships before they are mothballed. But that decision, according to the GAO, 'is not based on the full knowledge of the condition of the ships and associated operational implications because the Navy has not completed a comprehensive assessment of costs, benefits and risks of divesting the ships, as well as of ship conditions.' Navy officials told the GAO that 'they do not see the value the cruisers bring to the fleet,' because they are unreliable and suffer longstanding issues such as hull cracking, while also being less capable in some regards than more modern destroyers. But those same officials also acknowledged that they have not conducted inspections to understand the reliability and condition of the modernized ships. Cruiser modernization dates back to 2012, when the Navy first sought to retire multiple Ticonderogas due to budget constraints. Congress rejected such proposals and funded the modernization effort, and the sea service planned a phased approach that would give 11 cruisers five years of extra service life each. But the Navy did not fully understand the condition of its cruisers before they entered modernization, and officials told GAO that the ships were in worse condition than they realized. This was due to the Navy cancelling maintenance periods for their ships earlier in their service lives, allowing problems like fuel tank cracks to fester and balloon into major problems by the time modernization commenced. The Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Gettysburg (CG-64). (U.S. Navy) 'For example, according to OPNAV officials, the Navy deferred cruiser maintenance periods during the 2000s due to the operational need for the cruisers during the Global War on Terror,' the report states. 'Then, Navy officials told us the Navy canceled maintenance periods for the cruisers between 2011 and 2014, because the Navy was planning to divest the cruisers.' The Navy tried to better understand the cruisers’ conditions after Congress funded the modernization, and while these surveys were 'comprehensive and robust,' the high volume of unplanned work that emerged 'indicates that these efforts to gain information were unable to make up for years of not tracking ship condition and deferring maintenance,' the GAO report states. Officials told the GAO that the service is getting better at tracking required maintenance, helping ensure that ships can meet their service lives. 'However, these improvements are more impactful as a preventive measure on newer ships that have yet to fall behind than for older ships where the Navy has already deferred significant maintenance and lost track of condition, as happened with the cruisers,' the report states. Under its so-called 'Phased Modernization Plan,' the Navy inactivated the seven cruisers and cut manning from 350 billets to a 45-sailor caretaker crew, to save costs. Midway through each cruiser’s modernization, the ships force was supposed to be brought back to a normal size to help reactivate the ship, a decision the GAO called 'unusual.' 'A ship going through maintenance or modernization typically would not have its crew significantly reduced or be inactivated, according to Navy officials,' the GAO report states. This led to a host of problems when it came time to turn a given cruiser back on. 'Inactivating the ships and reducing the crew made it more difficult for program officials to understand the condition of and maintain the ships, thus inhibiting accurate planning for the modernization effort,' according to the GAO. 'For example, according to Navy officials, it was hard to assess the condition of inactivated ship systems. Further, because the ships had reduced crews of 45 sailors and the systems were turned off, these systems further deteriorated.' The GAO’s report–which involved interviewing more than 100 officials–also found that the Navy 'did not effectively plan the cruiser effort,' leading to a high amount of unplanned work that resulted in schedule delays and cost growth, including 9,000 contract changes. 'The Navy has yet to identify the root causes of unplanned work or develop and codify root cause mitigation strategies to prevent poor planning from similarly affecting future surface ship modernization efforts,' the report states. Once work began on the cruisers, the Navy at times struggled to provide the proper level of oversight, the GAO report states. A 2018 decision 'restricted officials from assessing monetary penalties to contractors without senior leadership approval,' according to the GAO. And in 2020, leadership reduced inspections of contractor work by nearly 50 percent, actions taken 'to maintain strong working relationships with the contractors because of the Navy’s dependence on them to modernize its fleet.' A graphic in a Government Accountability Office report on the Navy's cruiser modernization efforts shows how contractor oversight was reduced. (Government Accountability Office) 'Despite widespread instances of poor-quality work during the cruiser modernization effort, [Naval Sea Systems Command] senior leadership discouraged [Regional Maintenance Centers] and contracting officials from fully using key quality assurance tools to maintain the industrial base and a positive working relationship with the ship repair industry,' the report states. 'This reduced the RMC’s ability to ensure that contractors were producing quality work. Further, Navy guidance does not set forth clear roles that enable coordination among several key stakeholders within the Navy, which further inhibited effective oversight of work.' The GAO highlights several ships in the dwindling cruiser fleet and their persistently subpar state, even after years of modernization work. The USS Cowpens (CG-64), decommissioned in August 2024, went through eight years of modernization and still needed roughly $88 million and three more years of work as of June 2022, according to GAO, and photos from the following year reveal rust and corrosion on the deck plate, as well as holes in its flooring. An image from the Government Accountability Office's report on Navy cruiser modernization showcases the sorry state of the USS Cowpens' (CG-63) deck. (GAO) Another, USS Vicksburg (CG-69), was decommissioned in July 2024. Officials estimated in 2023 that it would require an additional $100 million, which did not include the cost to dry dock the ship and fix its sonar dome. The combat information center aboard the Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Vicksburg (CG-69) after years of modernization work. (Government Accountability Office) Even cruisers that have completed modernization are having issues, according to the GAO. The deployed Gettysburg completed its modernization and sea trials in February 2023, and the Navy’s Board of Inspection and Survey ruled that the ship met the minimum standard for going to sea. But a year later, in January 2024, the same board identified 'several outstanding issues during an inspection of the ship’s condition.' 'For example, several elements of the weapons systems were inoperable or degraded and there were structural issues throughout the ship,' the report states. The Navy addressed several of these issues after that inspection, and the cruiser completed 18 days at sea in June 2024, including a successful missile launch and intercept using its updated combat systems software. But before Gettysburg deployed in September 2024, the ships force told GAO of problems with steering gear and hydraulic power unit parts, among others, and that the Navy cannibalized parts from already-decommissioned cruisers. 'According to the ship’s crew, propulsion plant and electric system failures were key concerns for the USS Gettysburg deployment,' the report states. Cruisers that entered modernization all suffered 'widespread contractor performance and quality issues,' with Navy Regional Maintenance Centers issuing 1,400 corrective action requests to contractors to fix their incorrect work, the report states. One contractor used 'unauthorized materials such as plastic wrap, tape with common store bought glue, expanding foam and and as seen on television sealant products' to fix large sonar dome cables on a cruiser not identified by name in the GAO report. Shoddy work aboard a Ticonderoga class cruiser that the U.S. Navy was modernizing. (Government Accountability Office) A sonar dome rubber window damaged by a contractor during a U.S. Navy cruiser modernization effort. (Government Accountability Office) In another instance, contractors installed gun foundations at an incorrect height, requiring them to be removed and reinstalled, which led to a four-month delay. 'In addition, the gun could not fire without hydraulic fuel leaking,' the report states. 'Ship’s crew officials told us that they did not discover this issue until combat systems sea trials. The Navy has since corrected these issues.' A main gun aboard a U.S. Navy Ticonderoga class cruiser. (Government Accountability Office) On another ship, quality assurance officials noted five contractor personnel in three separate areas of the ship using incorrect welding methods in a single day. The Navy also failed to ensure that contractor work was sequenced properly. This led to delays in contractors installing equipment, and incomplete cabling and electrical distribution, aboard Vicksburg, the ship’s crew told GAO. 'They also told us that these issues led to 22 tons of electronic equipment sitting idle with no air conditioning,' the report states. 'Officials said a lack of temperature control caused problems preserving the computer equipment used to operate the Aegis Combat System aboard USS Vicksburg and that most likely a large portion of the electronic equipment is not salvageable. As another example, crew aboard USS Chosin told us that a modernization team contractor was unable to test a key system because the ship’s ventilation was not working. This caused a delay in ensuring that all key systems were operational.' The GAO report points out how unusual it is for a ship in maintenance to be transferred from Naval Surface Forces to Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) and back, and Navy officials noted that transferring ownership should not happen again. Navy officials concurred with the GAO that such lessons should be codified, but also told the watchdog that the Navy could need to inactivate a ship, reduce its crew size and transfer ownership to save money 'in a budget constrained environment.' 'They also stated that Navy leadership needs to retain flexibility,' the report states. 'However, doing so would likely significantly increase the risk of the Navy experiencing poor outcomes, as occurred with the cruiser modernization effort.' The Navy faces other challenges to increasing its overall fleet size, as well as maintaining its current warships and submarines. The new Constellation class frigates are also mired in delays, cost growth, and other problems, which you can read more about here. This is what led the service to announce last month that it would be extending the service lives of a dozen more Flight I Arleigh Burkes into the 2030s to help maintain overall operational capacity, according to past TWZ reporting. The Navy is relying on modernization efforts to maintain fleet size. And while service officials express confidence that the destroyer modernization program will not repeat the cruiser mistakes of the past, GAO’s findings indicate that such pitfalls remain a possibility.

Satellite Imagery Shows Ramp-Up In Russian Forces Massing At Base...	New satellite imagery shows large numbers of Russian vehicles and other materiel amassed at its Khmeimim Air Base and Tartus naval base in Syria. The active withdrawal of forces from Khmeimim is also continuing. This all comes despite continued insistence from authorities in Moscow that they are still looking to strike a deal to keep these highly strategic and prized facilities following the fall of the Assad regime. The War Zone obtained the new imagery of both Khmeimim and Tartus, which was taken today, from Maxar. The company also provided an additional image of Khmeimim from December 15 that highlights the significant departure of Russian forces from the base even by that point. The latest image of Khmeimim, seen below, shows dozens of vehicles and other equipment arranged in rows on an open apron at the northwest corner of the base, along with an Il-76 Candid cargo aircraft. Assets are often arrayed in this way on the tarmac at air bases ahead of their loading onto aircraft. Two smaller An-26 Curl turboprop transport aircraft, as well as a jet-powered An-72 Coaler, are also seen in nearby revetments. Satellite image ©2024 Maxar Technologies Russian forces have already been withdrawing from Khmeimim. This is now further underscored by Maxar's December 15 image of a portion of the northeastern end base, which notably shows the S-400 surface-to-air missile system site that had been deployed there for years has now been completely dismantled. Work to withdraw to the S-400, as well as other air defense assets, had already been observed at Khmeimim. Satellite image ©2024 Maxar Technologies Four Il-76s and Yak-40 small airliner are also seen on an open apron there. One of the Il-76s, as well as the Yak-40, belong to Syrian Airlines and there is the possibility that this Candid may have been one that went missing in the final chaotic moments of Assad's regime, are you can read more about here. There are also multiple helicopters visible, some of which appear to be missing their rotor blades. This could be a sign that they are being broken down to be loaded into transport planes. It appears that this Mi-8 is currently in the process of being taken apart for transport. It is missing its main rotor which was present on the image from a few days ago.Them dismantling helicopters is a very good sign that the base will cease to exist pic.twitter.com/xMMbbkUr47&mdash; Oliver Alexander (@OAlexanderDK) December 17, 2024 At Tartus, the Maxar imagery shows dozens of vehicles and other equipment clustered at the end of one of the piers.

A Ropucha class landing ship was also seen departing the Baltic last week and the Ivan Gren, another amphibious warfare ship, may be headed in the same general direction.

'They have ceased flight operations over the country.' 'It appears to us that they're [the Russians] taking the steps that would be necessary if they were planning to retrograde their forces from there,' the official added. 'We don't know if they've reached the decision to do that, or if they are in discussions on whether they need to do that or not, but that force consolidation that would enable them to depart has certainly happened.' From 'a naval perspective, they have sent their fleet that was in Tartus out into the eastern Mediterranean,' the official continued. 'It’s not in port in Tartus, or wasn't the last time I looked. And so, again, it looks like they're setting conditions to depart. And as I mentioned, they have ceased military operations there as best we can tell.'

Izzettin Kasim/Anadolu via Getty Images Though there is no doubt that Russia is significantly drawing down its military presence in Syria, as the senior defense official noted, it still remains unclear whether it plans to withdraw from Khmeimim and Tartus for good. There continue to be reports that Russian authorities are negotiating with representatives of the new rebel-led transitional government about the future of the bases. Officials in Moscow have consistently insisted that no final decision on the status of the facilities has been made. There are also unconfirmed reports that the Russian military may have been ordered to leave entirely within a month and that the Kremlin could now be looking to expand its presence in Libya as an alternative. As The War Zone has continued to stress, being ejected from Khmeimim and Tartus would be a huge loss for the Kremlin with ramifications extending well beyond Syria. The Russians have poured significant resources into expanding these bases, which Assad had essentially gifted to them through a 49-year 'lease' deal in 2017. The facilities offer uniquely strategic locations to project air and naval power into the Mediterranean and Africa. Any talks the Russians are having with rebel authorities in Damascus now can only be complicated by Moscow's instrumental and active role in keeping Assad's brutal regime in power over the past decade or so. Russian forces were still striking the very same rebels just days before they ousted Assad. The Kremlin also says that it helped Assad flee the country and that they have granted him asylum. Assad has remained out of the public eye for more than a week now. A report today from Politico says that some members of the European Union are pushing the bloc to actively pressure Syria's new government to force out the Russians. French authorities re-raised the country's flag at the embassy in Damascus today, which had been shuttered for the past 12 years, in the latest sign of Western powers looking to reengage post-Assad.

This includes an Israeli campaign of strikes on former regime military assets and ground intervention in the south, as well as an offensive by Turkish-backed rebels against U.S.-backed Kurdish groups in the north. The U.S. military itself remains a major player in the country, as well. Earlier today, the head of the U.S.-backed predominantly Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) offered major concessions, including turning the city of Kaboni into a demilitarized zone, as part of a proposal to end fighting Turkish-supported groups. He suggested American forces could help enforce such an arrangement.

Secretive Bladed AGM-114R9X Hellfire Missile Looks To Have Reemer...	A new targeted strike involving the use of the secretive AGM-114R9X Hellfire missile looks to have occurred in northwestern Syria. The R9X variant features an array of six pop-out sword-like blades rather than a traditional high-explosive warhead. This comes amid a flurry of foreign strikes, including U.S. military ones targeting ISIS, across the Middle Eastern country where the airspace is now permissive following the fall of long-time dictator Bashar Al Assad. American officials have been open about their fears that terrorist groups could exploit the current situation. As yet unconfirmed reports say that three missiles in total were fired at a vehicle in Syria's Idlib region near the border with Turkey. Who may have been inside the vehicle and who the intended target or targets may have been are unknown. Pictures now circulating online do show what looks to be the blade arrays from at least two AGM-114R9Xs, as well as other distinctly Hellfire debris. A *Unknown drone* went after a high ranking person in Idlib (north of Armanaz; close to the Turkish borde) - as of now it is unknown who it is.

This version of the Hellfire was developed explicitly as a way to prosecute targeted strikes while minimizing the risk of collateral damage to an extreme degree. The bladed version of the Hellfire, also nicknamed the 'ninja bomb' and 'the flying Ginsu,' has also been employed in multiple targeted strikes against vehicles in northwestern Syria in the past. MQ-9 Reaper drones tied to the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) are also understood to be the launch platform of choice. In fact, the first known instance of the R9X's use was in a 2017 strike that killed Al Qaeda’s then-number two leader, Abu Khayr Al Masri, as he traveled by car in Idlib. The War Zone was the first to call attention to the clear use of a mysterious new munition in that case.

As noted, American authorities have made no secret of their concerns about the chaotic situation in Syria following the downfall of Assad, as well as the drawdown of Russian forces in the country, providing new space for terrorists to regroup. American forces have launched dozens of strikes targeting ISIS in the past week or so. As The War Zone has highlighted in the past, the collapse of the Syrian military, as well as the ongoing pullback of Russian forces, has substantially reduced risks to U.S. and other foreign aircraft operating over the country. Strikes in the western half of Syria, in particular, had previously been carried out only by drones and through the use of stand-off munitions. 'U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) forces conducted precision airstrikes targeting known ISIS camps and operatives in Syria, Dec. 16, killing 12 ISIS terrorists,' CENTCOM said in a statement just yesterday. 'The strikes against the ISIS leaders, operatives, and camps were conducted as part of the ongoing mission to disrupt, degrade, and defeat ISIS, preventing the terrorist group from conducting external operations and to ensure that ISIS does not seek opportunities to reconstitute in central Syria. These recent strikes are in former Regime and Russian controlled areas ensuring pressure is maintained on ISIS.'

The United States has also launched targeted strikes against members of other groups, including Hurras al-Din (Al Qaeda's current Syrian franchise) and Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), in that corner of the country in the past. HTS, which claimed to have broken from Al Qaeda in 2016, was at the forefront of the ouster of Assad and is now leading the effort to create a new government in Damascus. The U.S. government has confirmed it has been in contact with HTS since the fall of the Assad regime, despite it, along with others, still officially designating the group as terrorists. The apparent R9X strike also underscores the ongoing fluidity of the situation throughout Syria and the sheer number of actors, internal and external, who remain very actively involved. Israeli and Turkish forces have been carrying out their own strikes across the country in pursuit of their own national security aims. Israel has been focused on preventing former Assad regime military assets from being used by other groups, while Turkey has been targeting Kurdish groups in the north, including U.S.-backed forces. Those countries have also been taking advantage of the newly permissive airspace above Syria. U.S. strikes in Syria, whether they involve R9Xs or not, as well as those by other foreign powers, only look set to continue amid the ongoing power vacuum in the country.

Multiple Drone Incursions Confirmed Over Marine Corps Base Camp P...	Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton in southern California experienced multiple drone incursions over its airspace over the past several days, a facility spokesman told The War Zone on Tuesday morning. Between Dec. 9 and 15, 'there were six instances of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) observed entering Camp Pendleton’s airspace, with no threat to installation operations,' Capt James C. Sartain, a base spokesman, told The War Zone in response to our query on the matter. Sartain could not immediately provide details about how many drones flew over the installation, their origin, what actions were taken in response and if any air or ground operations were affected as a result of the incursions. We have asked for these details and will update this story should any be provided. Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton Located in north San Diego County, MCB Camp Pendleton is the Marine Corps’ major west coast training facility. It is home to the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, 1st Marine Division, 1st Marine Logistics Group, elements of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, and several other tenant units including Marine Corps Air Station Camp Pendleton, ACU-5, Naval Hospital, the Marine Corps Tactical Systems Support Activity (MCTSSA), Weapons Field Training Battalion, Naval Weapons Station Fallbrook, and the Deployment Processing Command Reserve Support Unit - West). A map of the sprawling Camp Pendleton facility located on the SoCal coast. (USMC) This is just the latest in a growing string over incursions reported over U.S. military installations at home and abroad. News about MCB Camp Pendleton follows a drone incursion over Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio forcing the closure of its airspace Friday night into Saturday morning. The War Zone was the first to report that incident. On Tuesday, Wright-Patterson officials announced that there were additional incursions over the facility. 'Small unmanned aerial systems were spotted in the vicinity of and over Wright-Patterson AFB’s Area A and Area B during the late evening and early morning of Dec. 16 and Dec. 17th,' the 88th Air Base Wing said in a statement. 'Installation leaders have determined that none of the incursions impacted base residents, facilities or assets. The Wright-Patterson AFB airspace was not affected by the incursions.' 'The number of systems has fluctuated, and they have ranged in sizes and configurations,' the release added. 'Our units continue to monitor the airspace and are working with local law enforcement authorities and mission partners to ensure the safety of base personnel, facilities and assets. We request individuals in the area to contact either local police or Security Forces if they see anything suspicious, to include sUAS's or drone activity.' The sprawling Wright-Patterson AFB complex. (Google Earth) This all comes amid a growing frenzy about drones that began when they appeared over Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey on Nov. 18, which we were the first to report. Since then, the FBI said more than 5,000 reports of drone sightings came into its drone hotline, of which fewer than 100 merited further investigation. On Monday night, the Pentagon, FBI and Department of Homeland Security issued a statement that they have 'not identified anything anomalous and do not assess the activity to date to present a national security or public safety risk over the civilian airspace in New Jersey or other states in the northeast.' The full statement is below: 'There are more than one million drones lawfully registered with the FAA in the United States and there are thousands of commercial, hobbyist and law enforcement drones lawfully in the sky on any given day. With the technology landscape evolving, we expect that number to increase over time. FBI has received tips of more than 5,000 reported drone sightings in the last few weeks with approximately 100 leads generated, and the federal government is supporting state and local officials in investigating these reports. Consistent with each of our unique missions and authorities, we are quickly working to prioritize and follow these leads. We have sent advanced detection technology to the region. And we have sent trained visual observers. Having closely examined the technical data and tips from concerned citizens, we assess that the sightings to date include a combination of lawful commercial drones, hobbyist drones, and law enforcement drones, as well as manned fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and stars mistakenly reported as drones. We have not identified anything anomalous and do not assess the activity to date to present a national security or public safety risk over the civilian airspace in New Jersey or other states in the northeast. That said, we recognize the concern among many communities. We continue to support state and local authorities with advanced detection technology and support of law enforcement. We urge Congress to enact counter-UAS legislation when it reconvenes that would extend and expand existing counter-drone authorities to identify and mitigate any threat that may emerge. Additionally, there have been a limited number of visual sightings of drones over military facilities in New Jersey and elsewhere, including within restricted air space. Such sightings near or over DoD installations are not new. DoD takes unauthorized access over its airspace seriously and coordinates closely with federal, state, and local law enforcement authorities, as appropriate. Local commanders are actively engaged to ensure there are appropriate detection and mitigation measures in place.'

'We are seeing an increase of pilots of manned aircraft being hit in the eyes with lasers as people on the ground think they see a drone,' cautioned Nelson Delgado, the Acting Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Newark Field Office, which is leading the drone investigation. 'We are also concerned that people will take matters into their own hands and fire a weapon at an aircraft. Not only is this act against the law, but it poses an incredible danger to the pilots and passengers on those aircraft.' 'Whatever your beliefs are,' Delgado added, 'putting someone else's life in danger is not the answer.' pic.twitter.com/ELgIo1gnOt&mdash; FBI Newark (@FBINewark) December 16, 2024 The FBI warning came after pilots of 15 fixed and rotary wing aircraft from Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst reported being struck by lasers from the ground since Dec. 7, Capt. Kitsana R. Douglomachan told The War Zone. One of those pilots had to seek medical treatment but was quickly released. All aircraft landed safely, he said, adding that officials do not know who fired the lasers. NJ.com was the first to report these incidents. Monday night, Hill Air Force Base became the latest installation experiencing drone incursions. 'We can confirm that unmanned aerial systems were spotted in the vicinity of Hill AFB recently,' a spokesperson told KUTV-2 news Monday night. 'To date, unmanned aerial systems have not impacted Hill AFB operations and all appropriate measures are being taken to safeguard Hill AFB personnel, assets, and infrastructure.' An amazing elephant walk of F-35s at Hill Air Force Base. USAF U.S. officials are still trying to discover the origin of drones that appeared over four U.S. Air Force bases in the U.K., another story we first broke. They’ve been spotted over RAF Lakenheath, RAF Mildenhall, and RAF Feltwell, all within close proximity, and RAF Fairford, about 130 miles to the west. A few days earlier, Ramstein Air Base in Germany joined the growing list of places registering unknown drone overflights. TWZ has been on the leading edge of covering this topic for years and has broken multiple stories now about drone incursions over key U.S. bases and training ranges, as well as uncrewed aerial systems, harassing American forces off the coasts of the United States and making worrisome overflights of important non-military sites. A spate of drone incursions over Langley Air Force Base in Virginia in December 2023, which TWZ was the first report on, has now become a particular focal point of concern about these instances. While authorities are downplaying the majority of public drone sightings, they acknowledge a real concern about those flying over military installations, which as we have noted, forced the closure of airspace over one of those facilities.

Russian General Accused Of Using Chemical Weapons Assassinated By...	The Security Service of Ukraine has claimed responsibility for the assassination of a Russian general, the most high-profile killing of its kind since the start of the Kremlin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, the commander of Russia’s radiation, chemical, and biological defense troops, known as the RKhBZ, was killed in an explosion, along with his assistant, in Moscow early this morning, a day after Ukrainian state prosecutors charged him in absentia with the alleged use of banned chemical weapons. Sources within the Security Service of Ukraine, or SBU, told various news agencies that the killings were a 'special operation' by the organization. 'The liquidation of Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, chief of the Russian Armed Forces’ radiation, chemical, and biological defense troops is a special operation by the SBU,' one source told AFP. A view of the scene after Lt. Gen.

'We were involved in the operation,' the source said. Kirillov and his assistant were killed outside a Moscow apartment, when a bomb hidden in an electric scooter went off, according to Russia’s Investigative Committee, which probes serious crimes.

Kirillov had been listed on the Ukrainian Myrotvorets (Peacemaker) website, an unofficial database of people considered to be enemies of the country. As of this morning, a photograph of Kirillov on the website had the word 'Liquidated' overwritten in red letters. While other senior members of the Russian Armed Forces as well as civic and industry leaders, and pro-Kremlin figures, have been targeted in assassination attempts, especially in Crimea and Russian-occupied areas elsewhere in Ukraine, this incident is especially notable. Not only was Kirillov, who was 54, the most senior Russian military officer to be assassinated inside Russia by Ukraine, but authorities in Kyiv immediately claimed responsibility for the action. Previously, such targeted killings have often been left unclaimed. A view of the scene after the explosion outside a house on Moscow’s Ryazansky Prospekt, Moscow, on December 17, 2024. Photo by Sefa Karacan/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, now the deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, has said that Moscow will avenge the killing, threatening Ukraine’s military and political leadership with an unspecified imminent response, according to the state-run RIA news agency. 'Realizing the inevitability of its military defeat, [Ukraine] launches cowardly and despicable strikes in peaceful cities,' Medvedev added, according to RIA. As for the RKhBZ, the role of this organization is often misunderstood in the West. Officially known as the Troops of Radiological, Chemical, and Biological Defense of the Russian Armed Forces, its primary task is to provide protection for Russian military units, allowing them to fight in conditions of nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) contamination. In addition, the RKhBZ is tasked to enhance the survivability of the Russian Armed Forces against other weapons on the battlefield, for example by laying smokescreens. Traditionally, the RKhBZ has also been responsible for the Russian Ground Forces’ TOS-1A, a multiple-launch rocket system (MLRS) that fires a thermobaric rocket payload. Soldiers of an RKhBZ unit from the Russian Western Military District decontaminate a BTR-82A armored personnel carrier during a training camp run by the 20th Guards Army. Russian Ministry of Defense Of course, the RKhBZ would be involved in protecting Russian troops both against the NBC contaminants that they use, as well as those deployed by a potential enemy. Accordingly, Ukrainian prosecutors charged Kirillov in absentia with the use of banned chemical weapons in Ukraine, only yesterday. According to the SBU, there have been more than 4,800 cases of such weapons being used by Russia since the start of the full-scale invasion, leading to over 2,000 Ukrainian service members having been hospitalized. In May of this year, the U.S. State Department determined that Russian forces had used chloropicrin — a toxic choking agent that has a disorientating effect — in Ukraine. This was 'probably driven by Russian forces’ desire to dislodge Ukrainian forces from fortified positions and achieve tactical gains on the battlefield,' the State Department concluded. A World War II poster describes the effects of chlorpicrin for the benefit of U.S. servicemen. National Museum of Health and Medicine As we have discussed in the past, the exact definition of what constitutes a chemical weapon is complicated. However, chloropicrin is classified as a choking agent by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and its battlefield use is expressly banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which Russia also signed. In October, the United Kingdom put sanctions on Kirillov and the RKhBZ, in response to Russian forces’ use of chemical agents on the battlefield. Russia has denied having used chemical weapons. Meanwhile, Russian claims also extend the blame for such violations to Kyiv’s Western allies, although no independently verified evidence of this has ever been presented. Kirillov was also part of Russia’s attempts to rebuff Ukrainian claims that it had used chemical weapons in Ukraine. He appeared in the past on Russian state TV giving briefings, in which he accused Ukraine of violating nuclear safety protocols as well as implicating the West in various alleged crimes. In this grab from AFPTV footage, Igor Kirillov speaks at a briefing over an alleged chemical attack on the Syrian city of Douma, at the Patriot Park in the Moscow region on June 22, 2018. Photo by AFPTV / AFP AFPTV In a tribute to Kirillov, Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for Russia’s Foreign Ministry, said that he had worked 'fearlessly' for 'the Motherland' to expose what she said were the West’s chemical weapons-related and other crimes, including in Syria. While Kirillov might well be the most senior Russian Armed Forces figure to have been assassinated since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, there has been a series of high-profile killings, targeting, in particular, those who Kyiv considers guilty of war crimes. In 2022, Darya Dugina, the daughter of the Kremlin-linked far-right ideologue Alexander Dugin, was killed by a car bomb in the Moscow region. In 2023, pro-war blogger Vladlen Tatarsky was killed when the St. Petersburg cafe he was in was bombed. Tatarsky, who was born in the Donbas region of Ukraine, and had fought with pro-Russian separatist forces, had become one of Russia’s most outspoken and ultranationalist military bloggers. Municipal workers clean up the debris in the aftermath of the April 2, 2023, bomb blast in a cafe in Saint Petersburg, which killed military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky. Photo by OLGA MALTSEVA/AFP via Getty Images OLGA MALTSEVA Also last year, Stanislav Rzhitsky, a Russian submarine commander, accused of war crimes by Ukraine, was shot dead while jogging in the southern Russian city of Krasnodar. While Ukrainian authorities do not claim responsibility for all such assassinations, they have said that targeted killings are a legitimate tool in the war with Russia. Russian promises of revenge for Kirillov’s killing are nothing new, of course, but the high-profile nature of this latest assassination may prompt other reactions from the Kremlin. After all, the killing will likely have sent shock waves through the Russian Armed Forces leadership, in particular, raising questions about the safety of its senior officers even on the relative safety of home soil. A review of security protocols for leading Russian military personnel would seem to be an immediate priority. 'The killing of a lieutenant general will be a shock for many,' a former senior Russian defense official told The Guardian, speaking on conditions of anonymity. 'This will definitely cause a stir,' the former official added. Bolstering the security details assigned to figures like Kirillov would be one obvious response. However, relevant units of the Russian Armed Forces and internal security forces are already heavily engaged in Ukraine, with an ever-present threat of assassinations and sabotage in Russian-occupied areas. For now, the assassination of Kirillov appears to be a win for Ukraine, which will see his elimination as justice for his involvement in the alleged use of banned chemical weapons. It is also perhaps the most powerful signal so far of the potential vulnerability of even the highest-ranking Russian military officers, wherever they might be. At the same time, it could result in a renewed focus by the Kremlin in targeting Ukrainian leadership.

The Mystery Of The Syrian IL-76 Cargo Jet That Went Missing As As...	There is growing, but still circumstantial evidence that a Syrian Airlines Il-76 Candid cargo plane currently at Russia's Khmeimim Air Base in Syria is one that appeared to go missing in the final chaotic moments of Bashar Al Assad's regime. Rumors and claims swirled that the aircraft had been carrying Assad and was shot down after it disappeared from online flight tracking sites. The Syrian dictator fled the capital Damascus for Khmeimim, and then to Moscow, according to the first statement attributed to him in more than a week that was put out earlier today. A Syrian Airlines Il-76 is seen at Khmeimim Air Base on December 15, 2024. Izzettin Kasim/Anadolu via Getty Images The statement said to have been from Assad was posted through a channel on the Telegram social media network linked to the now-defunct Syrian regime earlier today, but it is unclear whether or not he actually drafted it and/or put it online. The deposed Syrian dictator has not been seen publicly in more than a week, despite Russian officials saying they have offered him asylum. You can read more about the overall current situation in Syria, which remains very fluid, in our past reporting here. Assad relocated to Khmeimim via unspecified means and with Russia's assistance on December 8, according to the statement. It also claims the Syrian strongman had initially intended to continue commanding the fight against rebel forces from the Russian base. So far there is no independent corroboration of this assertion. The War Zone has noted in the past that the Russian air base would be the safest place in the country for Assad in a crisis. 'With no viable means of leaving the base, Moscow requested that the base's command arrange an immediate evacuation to Russia on the evening of Sunday 8th December,' the statement adds. 'This took place a day after the fall of Damascus, following the collapse of the final military positions and the resulting paralysis of all remaining state institutions.' The basic timeline outlined in the statement aligns with online flight tracking data that showed a Syrian Airlines Il-76 with the Syrian registration YK-ATA fly north from the Damascus area early on December 8. The tracking data for that flight cut out just after it passed the city of Homs, which rebel forces had taken control of on December 7. That, combined with data showing a pronounced left turn and a precipitous drop in speed and altitude, all the way down to 1,625 feet and 130 knots, had quickly sparked rumors that the aircraft had been shot down. Last night we tracked a Ilyushin Il-76T flight over Syria.The flight took off from Damascus and the signal was lost near the city of Homs.* We can confirm that flight took place.* The aircraft was old with an older transponder generation, so some data might be bad or… pic.twitter.com/uCGUnVeug0&mdash; Flightradar24 (@flightradar24) December 8, 2024 Publicly available data from NASA’s Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS), which is primarily intended to help monitor wildfires and other blazes sparked by natural disasters, had also shown a 'hot spot' exactly in the area where the aircraft dropped off radar. The War Zone has been working to obtain high-resolution imagery of this location, but we have not received a clear picture yet. No imagery has otherwise emerged to date showing any apparent Il-76 wreckage in Syria.

'With that in mind, analyzing the raw ADS-B data received from YK-ATA shows positional and speed data that strains credulity.' It's also worth noting here that YK-ATA's trip north was unusual, to begin with, based on flight tracking data from ADS-B Exchange that The War Zone reviewed. In the months leading up to Assad's fall, the plane was very active, but was observed flying routes to and from locations in Africa. Flightradar24's December 12 blog post also says that 'in recent months the aircraft has visited Benghazi, Libya on a regular basis.' There are now reports that Russia may be looking to make any losses to its presence in Syria by expanding its posture in Libya, though there are no indications that is tied to YK-ATA recent flight history. An example of a typical flight track for YK-ATA in the months leading up to the fall of Assad's regime. This particular flight occurred on December 3. ADS-B Exchange Furthermore, it has now been confirmed that a Syrian Airlines Il-76 is parked in one corner of an open apron at the northeast end of Khmeimim. Satellite imagery The War Zone has reviewed from Planet Labs show the Candid at its current position by December 9. An Il-76 was seen parked between the runways the day before and was not there on December 7. A Syrian Airlines Yak-40, a passenger plane that is between a large business jet and a small airliner size-wise, also appeared at the base on December 8. The Yak-40 was initially parked on a different apron, but was moved next to the Il-76 by December 13. The video in the social media post below, which was taken via a drone and that Turkey-based Syria TV put out last week, clearly shows a Syrian Airlines Il-76 at Khmeimim at multiple points in its runtime.

The Il-76 could have been used to help spirit other assets, including regime riches, to Khmeimim and then out of the country. It would have been a top priority for Assad to get physical assets, including gold and currency reserves, to a safe place. The Assad family has already been reportedly squirreling away vast wealth overseas for years. There are reports that other former regime officials have been fleeing to the Russian base in order to get out of the country with the Kremlin's help, as well. However, it remains unknown for sure whether or not it is YK-ATA at the Russian base. Syrian Airlines has four Il-76s in its inventory and no imagery has emerged so far clearly showing the registration on the example at Khmeimim. There is still a possibility that YK-ATA went elsewhere or came down. Questions very much remain about what might happen to the Khmeimim Air Base, including the Syrian Airlines aircraft there, as well as Russia's naval base at Tartus. The air and naval facilities are highly strategic facilities for the Kremlin that support operations beyond Syria. A substantial withdrawal of Russian forces from the country is underway, but it remains unclear whether or not they are leaving for good. Russian officials insist that they are still trying to hold on to their two prized bases, but there are unconfirmed reports that they could be ordered to vacate the country within a month. You can read more about what is known now about these deliberations in reporting here. The end of Assad's regime has already provided the opportunity for unprecedented views of Khmeimim. Maybe now clearer imagery will emerge showing the Syrian Airlines Il-76's registration code to settle the question of whether this is the 'missing' jet for good.

North Korean Troops Launched Large-Scale Combat Operations In Kur...	North Korean troops began conducting large-scale assault operations against Ukrainian forces in Russia’s Kursk region last week, the head of the Ukrainian Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR) told The War Zone on Monday. That timeline was later confirmed by the Pentagon. While there have been about 12,000 North Koreans in Kursk for months to help Russia push back the Ukrainian invasion there, they only recently began to attack in larger numbers, Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov told us. His comments followed those by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who on Saturday said that 'the Russians have begun to use North Korean soldiers in their assaults—a significant number of them.

'Language barrier remains a difficult obstacle to management and coordination of actions,' GUR explained. As a result, North Korean soldiers fired on vehicles belonging to the Akhmat battalion of Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov. At least eight of those fighters were killed in the incident, GUR claimed. On Saturday and Sunday, at least 30 North Koreans were killed or wounded in fighting near three villages - Matrynovka on the easternmost portion of the Ukrainian salient, Plekhovo in a contested area about 10 miles to the south, and Vorobzha, which is about nine miles to the southeast in Russian-held territory. The War Zone cannot independently verify Ukraine's casualty claims. The North Koreans suffered losses fighting near Martynovka in Russia's Kursk Oblast, Ukraine claims. Google Earth image 'Due to losses, the assault groups are being replenished with fresh personnel, in particular from the 94th separate brigade of the DPRK army, to continue active combat operations in the area,' GUR explained, using the official Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) acronym for North Korea. The Pentagon’s top spokesman on Monday confirmed GUR's claim that the North Koreans are now fighting alongside Russians. They entered combat alongside Russian troops 'about a week ago,' Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters at a Pentagon briefing. 'We do have indications that they have separate casualties, both killed and wounded,' he said. 'I don't have specific numbers to provide for you, but that is obviously something that we continue to monitor. And as we've said all along, those forces are legitimate military targets for the Ukrainians, given that they are engaged in active combat.' North Korean and Russian troops are now fighting together in Kursk officials say. (Via Twitter) Via Twitter After launching the Kursk invasion in August, Ukraine captured about 500 square miles of what was initially lightly defended territory. Russia has since mounted two counter-operations, including one in September that saw upwards of 60,000 troops recapture about half of what it had lost by the end of November. Since then, there haven’t been any major territorial gains or losses by either side as the fight has bogged down in the frigid December weather. Having 12,000 North Koreans in the mix is certainly a boon for Russia, even with language and command and control issues. As we have noted before, as Moscow and Pyongyang continue to cement their relationship, many more troops could be on the way given that manpower is North Korea's greatest resource. There are many other facets to this relationship. In addition to potentially receiving air defense systems and energy supplies from Russia in exchange for the troops in Kursk and assorted weaponry, including millions of artillery shells, North Korea is reportedly going to receive fighter aircraft as well. Russian Su-27 (Dmitry A. Mottl/Wikimedia Commons) There have also been concerns that Moscow might provide North Korea with technologies to help accelerate its nuclear and long-range ballistic missile programs. Russia would also be a prime candidate to assist North Korea in pushing forward its submarine program, which also includes a growing family of submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) as well as increasingly advanced submarine technologies. PHOTO BY VLADIMIR SMIRNOV/POOL/AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES On Monday, the Foreign Ministers of Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the High Representative of the European Union issued a joint statement condemning the burgeoning North Korea-Russia relationship. Those nations also raised concerns that this is inflaming tensions on the Korean peninsula. 'Direct DPRK support for Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine marks a dangerous expansion of the conflict, with serious consequences for European and Indo-Pacific security,' the statement read in part. 'The DPRK’s export of ballistic missiles, artillery shells, and other military materiel to Russia for use against Ukraine and Russia’s training of DPRK soldiers involving arms or related materiel represent flagrant violations of United Nations Security Council resolutions 1718 (2006), 1874 (2009), and 2270 (2016). We are deeply concerned about any political, military, or economic support that Russia may be providing to the DPRK’s illegal weapons programs, including weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery, which would exacerbate the already tense environment on the Korean Peninsula.' Ukraine's investment in Kursk comes as it continues to lose ground in the eastern part of its own country. As we have continuously highlighted in the past, Kursk is a bargaining chip. With Donald Trump set to return to the White House on Jan. 20, both sides are trying to grab as much territory as possible ahead of any future peace negotiations or any plan implemented by the new administration. The Latest Elsewhere on the battlefield, Russia continues to make gains in the east, particularly in Donetsk Oblast. Their push toward Pokrovsk continues but has yet to succeed. These are the key takeaways from the latest Institute for the Study of War assessment. Russian forces conducted a roughly battalion-sized mechanized assault in the Siversk direction following a recent reported command change of the Russian forces operating near Siversk. The recent Siversk assault indicates that Russian forces appear to be learning to conduct more effective assaults but remain far from restoring maneuver to the battlefield. North Korean forces are reportedly facing expected struggles with high casualties and poor communication with Russian forces in Kursk Oblast, likely disrupting coordination between North Korean and Russian personnel and undermining Russian military operations. Russian forces recently advanced near Siversk, Toretsk, Pokrovsk, and Vuhledar.

The sniper 'was actually on the same terrain level with the Russian occupier, aimed in the harsh Ukrainian December, fired while standing in a trench at the enemy, who was moving in a landing - and hit with the first shot,' GUR stated on its website. '‘In the conditions of modern warfare, you do not have the opportunity to climb out of a trench, lie down in a landing, etc. Enemy drones do not allow you to shoot from classic positions,’' the scout explained.' The shot was 'a masterful job that will definitely go down in the history of our struggle for freedom,' Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov said in a statement on the GUR website. 'Hitting a moving target at such a distance is a huge achievement; evidence of high professionalism and concentration, which snipers of Ukrainian military intelligence are famous for. We continue the fight to destroy even more Russian occupiers!' To make the shot, Lecturer said he fired a .338 Lapua Magnum (8.6mm) round from a Sako TRG M10 sniper rifle. 'But if I had a choice: to choose one rifle and one cartridge, I would take the Cadex Kraken and the .338LM caliber,' noted 'Lecturer.'

Future Of Russia’s Bases In Syria Remains In Flux, Libya Possible...	While the Russian military continues to withdraw equipment and troops from Syria, Israel has continued its air raids, intended to further degrade what is left of the former Syrian Armed Forces’ fighting capacity. Israel bombarded Syria overnight with what was described by a U.K.-based war monitor group as 'the heaviest strikes' in the area in more than a decade. Meanwhile, there are varied reports suggesting that Russian forces might vacate Syria within days, or within a month, although officials on both sides have stressed that negotiations are ongoing. Overnight Israeli strikes on the Syrian coastal Tartus region targeted various sites including air defense units and surface-to-surface missile depots, according to the war monitor group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The same group said these were 'the heaviest strikes in Syria’s coastal region since the start of strikes in 2012.'

Photo by Bakr ALKASEM / AFP BAKR ALKASEM Outside of the Tartus region, Israel is also reported to have targeted missile launchers in the Hama area and radars at the military air base at Deir ez-Zor. The ongoing campaign of Israeli strikes is designed to destroy regime weapons stockpiles to prevent them from falling into the hands of Islamist groups. Last week, the Israeli military said it had conducted 350 strikes in Syria, destroying 80 percent of the strategic military capabilities left behind by the Bashar al-Assad regime. The Israeli bombardment has led to protests from the new Syrian administration, led by a rebel coalition. The administration has also lodged a complaint with the U.N. Security Council about Israeli incursions into Syrian territory in the Golan Heights. Israeli troops and military vehicles cross in and out of Syria through a gate in the boundary fence near the Druze village of Majdal Shams on the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights, on December 15, 2024. Photo by Mati Milstein/NurPhoto via Getty Images Mati Milstein Mohammed al-Jolani, the leader of the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) Islamist group that led the offensive against the Assad regime, said the Israeli strikes 'crossed red lines' but conceded that Syria was in no fit state to seek further conflict. 'Syria’s war-weary condition, after years of conflict and war, does not allow for new confrontations. The priority at this stage is reconstruction and stability, not being drawn into disputes that could lead to further destruction,' Jolani said in an interview with Syria TV. Some more details have come to light on Assad’s rapid departure from Syria earlier this month. In a statement published on the Syrian presidency’s Telegram channel, Assad claimed he left Russia's Khmeimim Air Base for Moscow on December 8. He claims that he was evacuated from the air base as it came under drone attack, having left Damascus the same morning as opposition fighters closed in on the capital. The comment was Assad’s first in public since he was toppled from power by the rebel offensive. Recent activity at Khmeimim Air Base and the Russian naval base at Tartus, in satellite imagery. PHOTO © 2024 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Having propped up the Assad regime, Russia is continuing to withdraw military equipment and troops from Syria. TWZ has already reported on apparent Russian evacuations from Khmeimim Air Base in Syria. These movements have now been confirmed by different Western officials — including two from the United States. However, those same officials, speaking to CNN, described the Russian withdrawal as 'large-scale and significant,' but said it was unclear if the evacuation would be permanent. With HTS now effectively in control in Syria, the fate of the Russian facilities — including Khmeimim Air Base and the naval base at Tartus — will be dependent on some kind of negotiated settlement between the rebel group and Moscow.

At the same time, an aerostat has also appeared over the base, to provide additional surveillance. A surveillance balloon, belonging to the Russian military, over Khmeimim Air Base on December 15, 2024. Photo by Izzettin Kasim/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu Other recent aircraft movements have involved the evacuation of Russian diplomatic personnel in Damascus as well as Belarusian and North Korean diplomats, using Russian Air Force flights out of Khmeimim. 'We don’t feel unsafe, we are hoping to make friendly relations with the new government as soon as it becomes a legitimate government,' a representative of the Russian military at Khmeimim told The Guardian today, in a rare interview. 'Neither side is making provocations and things have been fine,' the Russian military representative added. There is also now growing evidence of Libya’s support for the Russian military exodus from Syria. At least some of the Russian naval assets have been moved from Tartus to Libya, while there are reports that Moscow is stepping up pressure on Libyan National Army commander Khalifa Haftar to allow Russia access to a port in Benghazi. This would provide Russia with an alternative naval installation on the Mediterranean, the importance of which we have discussed in the past. At least one Syrian-registered Il-76 Candid airlifter has also been noted in recent days operating between Syria and Libya, and other locations in Africa. Should Russia end up leaving Syria altogether, Libya could well provide an alternative hub for the Russian military to provide access to the Mediterranean and as a transshipment point for other Russian interests in Africa. Officially, at least, Russia says it’s still to decide on the fate of its military bases in Syria. The Kremlin today said it was in contact with those in charge of the country.

This was confirmed today by Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder. Among the key systems that have departed are S-400 long-range surface-to-air missile systems previously based at Khmeimim. 'One of the big factors that has changed in Syria is the airspace, in the sense that previously you had Syrian regime and Russian air defenses, which would preclude in many cases our ability or desirability to go into those areas' to conduct anti-ISIS operations, Ryder told reporters. 'It is a much more permissible environment now, in that regard.' Since the fall of the Assad regime, the U.S. military has flown several rounds of airstrikes targeting ISIS camps and operatives in Syria. For now, it remains to be seen what kind of presence the Russian military will have in Syria longer-term. These are very much still early days in a tentative relationship being established between Moscow and the new administration in Syria; after all, Russian forces bombed HTS and other rebel groups, as well as much of the Syrian population for nearly a decade. However, should basing options in Syria fall through, it may be the case that Libya is on hand to provide some alternatives for the Russian military to retain its presence in the region.

China Launches Hypersonic Test Planes From Drones, Balloons	A video and pictures have emerged showing testing of Chinese high-flying and high-speed uncrewed air vehicles, including aerial releases from a TB-001 drone and a high-altitude balloon. The air vehicle designs are related to the MD-22, ostensibly a hypersonic testbed, which first broke cover two years ago. The bulk of the new imagery comes from the video clip seen in the social media post below. Additional pictures have also appeared online. A machine translation of the audio accompanying the footage shows an apparent focus on the life and inspiration of Qian Xuesen, rather than the MD-series vehicles. Qian did pioneering aerospace work in the United States, including co-founding NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, before being caught up in the Red Scares of the 1950s. He was subsequently placed under partial house arrest before being deported to China, where he became instrumental in the country's ballistic missile and space programs. 中国临近空间宽域飞行器研制试验首次公开披露！ pic.twitter.com/mLkCQQ5zX1&mdash; DS北风（风哥） (@WenJian0922) December 16, 2024 Still, the video does offer very interesting new looks and insights into the MD-22-related air vehicles. Examples are seen marked MD-19 and MD-21, as well as one where only 'MD-2' is visible. The MD-19 sports the logos of the Institute of Mechanics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (IMCAS) and CAS itself on the rear left side of its central fuselage. The development team behind the MD-22 includes IMCAS, as well as the Guangdong Aerodynamic Research Academy (GARA). IMCAS and CAS logos, as well as a read hexagon and illegible writing, are seen here at the rear of the left side of the MD-19's fuselage. Chinese Internet via X An air vehicle marked MD-21 is seen here in the background. Chinese Internet via X Only 'MD-2' is visible marked on the side of this air vehicle. Chinese Internet via X In the video, the MD-19, MD-21, and 'MD-2' all look to have the same general overall layout as the MD-22 with its wedge-shaped main fuselage, delta wings, and twin canted vertical tails. The MD-19 has retractable tricycle landing gear, a feature also depicted on the mockup of the MD-22 that first broke cover at the Zhuhai Airshow in 2022. The MD-22 design has been stated to be close to 35.5 feet (10.8 meters) long, had a wingspan of nearly 15 feet (4.5 meters), an empty weight of one ton, a maximum takeoff weight of four tons, a peak speed of Mach 7, and a maximum range of 4,970 miles (8,000 kilometers). The War Zone noted at the time that the range figure seemed, at best, highly aspirational and could reflect further iterations or evolutions of the design under development. A mock-up of the MD-22 on display the Zhuhai Airshow in 2022. Chinese Internet What kind of propulsion systems the MD-22 or any of these related vehicles use remains unclear. However, the new imagery further points to the core design being based around a single air-breathing main engine, possibly flanked by a pair of rocket motors. This, in turn, could indicate the use or planned use of advanced high-speed engines like dual-mode ramjets or scramjets, which do not work effectively at subsonic speeds. Platforms that use those engines therefore require some kind of initial boost, typically from one or more rocket motors. Aerodynamic fairings are seen in place at the rear of the MD-19 and 'MD-2' vehicles in the newly emerged imagery, which could break away when the various engines/motors start. A look at the rear of one of the MD-series vehicles after its release from a high-altitude balloon, showing three openings at the rear. Chinese Internet via X Another view of the MD-19 after its release from a TB-001 drone showing three aerodynamic fairings, one larger than the other two, in place at the rear. Chinese Internet via X The video and other images show the MD-19 being released from a TB-001 drone and then landing on a traditional runway. Whether this was a powered flight test or if the vehicle glided back down to Earth is unclear. The MD-19 also looks to be between one-third and one-quarter of the length of the nearly 33-feet-long (10-meter-long) TB-001, or between roughly eight and 11 feet (2.5 and 3.35 meters). This is notably shorter than the MD-22. A view of the MD-19 being released from the TB-001. Chinese Internet via X A low-resolution view of the TB-001 with the MD-19 under its wing. Chinese Internet via X Tengden's TB-001 is a now well-established design, versions of which are in operational service with China's People's Liberation Army (PLA). Though the TB-001 has been shown with various weapons and other stores loaded on pylons under its wings in the past, this appears to be the first time it has been seen launching another uncrewed platform of any kind in flight. A stock image of a TB-001 with various munitions, or mock-ups thereof, under its wings. VCG/VCG via Getty Images The newly emerged footage separately shows the 'MD-2' vehicle, which also appears to be smaller than the MD-22, being loaded into a payload adapter, which is then carried aloft by a high-altitude balloon and released. It's unclear if the vehicle's subsequent flight was powered at any point and how or if it was recovered afterward. China actively uses high-altitude balloons for various research and development and test and evaluation activities, as well as intelligence-gathering purposes and other military purposes. This includes past hypersonic testing, as well as use as aerial launch platforms for drone swarms and other payloads with a clear eye to future operational capabilities as The War Zone has previously explored in depth. Screen captures from the video showing the 'MD-2' being loaded into the payload adapter (at left) and after release (at right). Chinese Internet via X There is the potential that the 'MD-2' and MD-21, the latter of which is seen in the background at one point in the video, are one and the same, or at least examples of the same design. Given the known existence now of the MD-19, MD-21, and MD-22 vehicles, another possibility could be that the one released from the balloon was the MD-20. Whether the various MD-series vehicles are all testbeds and/or test articles supporting the development of a single design or are differently scaled members of a family of designs, and whether there are any additional related types, are unknown. In April, a grainy image emerged showing a Chinese H-6 bomber variant carrying a still unidentified dark-colored aerospace vehicle, seen below, which may have been an MD-22 or a related design, under its fuselage. Versions of the H-6 are used operationally as launch platforms for the WZ-8 rocket-powered supersonic spy drone. Chinese Internet via X Past descriptions have presented the MD-22 as a platform intended to support the development of hypersonic technologies more broadly. The Chinese government has been investing heavily in hypersonic capabilities in general in recent years and continues to do so, and those developments certainly require an array of specialized test assets and associated infrastructure. Various testbeds, including Stratolaunch's Talon-A, which is similar in some broad strokes to the MD types, but is larger and not air-breathing, are part of the U.S. military's hypersonic development plans for the same reasons. At the Zhuhai Airshow this year, the same GARA that worked on the MD-22 notably displayed a concept for an unpowered hypersonic boost-glide weapon called the GDF-600 designed to be loaded with various submunitions. Launching payloads of any kind from a platform traveling at hypersonic speed presents significant technological challenges because of the physical and thermal stresses involved, particularly during separation. The MD-series vehicles could be useful for proving out such a capability. It remains unclear whether there are any plans to operationalize the MD-series vehicles directly, but it would not be hard to see potential interest in doing so. An MD-series platform used to demonstrate how a high-altitude hypersonic air vehicle could perform missions like kinetic strike or intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), would be a clear stepping stone to an operational capability. Even smaller, shorter-range variations could be used in a similar role as the WZ-8 or even as missiles. Combining rocket motors with a high-speed air-breathing main propulsion system would also offer a valuable self-contained solution that could allow for multiple launch options, as is seen in the newly emerged video. Being able to air-launch the vehicles could extend their reach and otherwise provide additional flexibility in a real-world context. The U.S. Air Force had been working along broadly similar lines with its secretive Mayhem program, the future of which is now very murky, as you can read more about here.

M1A2 Abrams Tanks Arrive In Taiwan	Taiwan has received its first batch of M1A2T Abrams main battle tanks as it continues its drive to modernize its armed forces, which face an expanding military threat from Beijing. While the upgrade for the Republic of China Army (ROCA) — which was still operating 1950s-era M41A3 Walker Bulldog light tanks up until recently — is obvious, there are still questions about how suitable the big and heavy Abrams is for the island’s very particular defensive requirements. Heavy Armors Have Arrived!Welcome to join us!#M1A2T #ROCArmy pic.twitter.com/OTXtU7pw5h&mdash; 國防部 Ministry of National Defense, ROC(Taiwan) (@MoNDefense) December 16, 2024 Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense (MND) confirmed today that the first shipment of M1A2T tanks had arrived from the United States. On its official social media channel, the MND published imagery showing the Abrams being inspected and then loaded onto flatbed trucks for onward transport. The tanks were apparently unloaded from a ship at the port of Taipei yesterday. According to Taiwan’s state-owned Central News Agency (CNA), the initial shipment comprised 38 M1A2T tanks, at least some of which will be delivered to the ROCA’s Army Armor Training Command at Hsinchu in northwestern Taiwan. Other reports from Taiwan suggest that 10 of the new tanks will remain with the training unit, while the others will go to frontline armored brigades in Linkou District, New Taipei, and in Hukou Township, Hsinchu County. From there, they would be best positioned to help defend northern Taiwan. Part of the first shipment of M1A2T tanks is prepared for onward transport. Taiwan Ministry of National Defense In total, Taiwan has 108 M1A2T tanks on order. Citing the MND, the CNA reports that another 42 of the tanks will be delivered next year, with the remaining 28 to follow in 2026. Taiwan’s order for M1A2T tanks was approved in July 2019, in a deal valued at around $2 billion, as announced by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA). The arms package also included 250 Block I-92F Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, M88A2 armored recovery vehicles, and Oshkosh M1070A1 heavy equipment transporters. 'This proposed sale of M1A2 tanks will contribute to the modernization of the recipient’s main battle tank fleet, enhancing its ability to meet current and future regional threats and to strengthen its homeland defense,' the DSCA’s statement said at the time. 'These tanks will contribute to the recipient’s goal of updating its military capability while further enhancing interoperability with the United States and other partners.' Covered by a tarpaulin, one of the first M1A2T is transported by road. Taiwan Ministry of National Defense The ‘T’ in the designation of the new tanks indicates that this version was specifically developed for Taiwan. Previous Taiwanese media reports also described these as 'M1A2X' tanks. Broadly speaking, the M1A2T is equivalent to the M1A2 SEPv3 version — or System Enhancement Package version 3 — which you can read more about here. Development of the SEPv3 was launched by the U.S. Army in response to lessons learned during fighting in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Changes to the tank address space, weight, and power issues, as well as enhancing overall survivability. The SEPv3 version offers increased electrical power, vehicle health management systems, upgraded armor, the ability to deploy the Israeli-made Trophy active protection system, integrated counter-improvised explosive device (IED) protection, a new auxiliary power unit, and embedded training aids. The U.S. Army describes it as 'the most reliable Abrams tank ever produced.' A U.S. Army M1A2 SEPv3 main battle tank. U.S. Army The M1A2T specifically features a reconfigured turret and various unspecified modifications to improve its survivability, as well as a modified electrical system and auxiliary power unit, and a new ammunition datalink — used when firing programmable munitions. Taiwan’s requirement for new armor is reflected in the fact that the last tanks to be delivered from the United States were M60A3s, orders for which began to be received in 1994. Since then, the ROCA has relied on M60A3s as well as locally upgraded CM11 and CM12 Brave Tiger tanks.

This tank also features a fire-control system derived from that found on the M1A1 Abrams, making it more accurate, including on the move. Taiwan also obtained a significant number of additional fire-control upgrade kits and installed them on some of their remaining M48A3s, resulting in the CM12.

Taiwan introduced it back in 1958 but later used it for training. An M41A3 in Republic of China Army service. Youth Daily News Nevertheless, much-reworked M41D tanks, based on the original M41 but with a new diesel engine, re-armed turret, and thermal imaging equipment, remain in use in small numbers. Even discounting the antiquated M41, the M1A2T is a much more modern and capable proposition than any of the ROCA’s other tanks. The M60A3, CM11, and CM12 are all armed with 105mm main guns that are outclassed by the larger 120mm cannons on modern Chinese main battle tanks, for example. The M1A2T uses a 120mm main gun complemented by a Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS) that combines a sensor suite with a machine gun. Facing the threat of a People’s Liberation Army (PLA) invasion, Taiwan’s defensive strategy means that every single tank and armored vehicle would have to count toward the island’s defense, were it to go to war. With Beijing continuing to claim Taiwan as its territory and with repeated threats to invade and seize control of the island by force if necessary, this has driven the retention of even obsolescent equipment. This is something that the M1A2T deliveries go some way to address. ROCA tanks and other assets take part in Combat Readiness Week maneuvers in 2020: On the other hand, the Abrams is a big, heavy, expensive, and maintenance-intensive machine. Even sustaining these tanks in combat is a big ask, their gas-turbine engines placing significant demands on fuel, especially. I think we need to mention sustaining these in a fight, including keeping them fueled, is an issue While there’s no doubting its firepower and performance, as well as very high levels of protection, it’s not invulnerable — as Ukraine’s experience has demonstrated. At the same time, the weight of the Abrams — especially the SEPv3 version — is such that it is not always able to negotiate softer ground or more basic roads. When Australia ordered the SEPv3, it was reported that significant parts of the north of that country — where much military training takes place — is too swampy and the roads too rudimentary to support the new tanks. The Trophy active protection system alone is said to add around 5,000 pounds of weight, with an overall weight, in combat, of 73.6 tons. It’s unclear if Taiwan will receive Trophy for its Abrams, but the equipment would provide a very useful additional layer of protection against various threats — including potentially drones. The Abrams is also arguably not best suited to the kinds of urban warfare that the ROCA might have to engage in if it meets a PLA invasion — something that it already regularly trains for in just these kinds of settings. These kinds of scenarios pose a particular challenge for main battle tanks. A ROCA M113 armored personnel carrier concealed under a bridge during an urban combat exercise. ROC Military News Agency More generally, there are questions about the utility of heavy armor in potential conflicts in the Indo-Pacific region. Most such scenarios are expected to heavily feature air and sea platforms, as well as missiles. These concerns have also led to a resurgence in interest in light tanks, including the U.S. Army’s new M10 Booker, which you can read all about here. A U.S. Army M10 Booker light tank. U.S. Army The M10 Booker. US Army In fact, the particular advantages of the M10 for Taiwan are something we have discussed in the past, speaking to an armor expert: 'The Booker would prove a valuable platform in a Taiwan ground fight … About two-thirds of the island is mostly rugged mountains. It features flat to rolling plains in the densely populated west, which faces mainland China. The M10’s smaller size compared to an Abrams would allow it to better maneuver through the tight, restricted urban areas where much of the fighting would take place. It would be able to pass over bridges an Abrams might not be able to cross due to weight concerns and operate … with a much lighter logistical footprint. The smaller 105mm main gun on the M10, the same expert added, 'is powerful enough to handle most Chinese equipment.' Nevertheless, for the time being, the ROCA is focused on the M1A2T and the major advantages in firepower and protection that it will bring compared with its predecessors. It’s also important to note that these tanks are just part of a multilayered defensive strategy for the ROCA, which also includes AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, long-range artillery, and multiple-launch rocket systems, as well as coastal defense missiles that would hope to create havoc among an invasion fleet before it even managed to land any troops and supporting armor. The nature of the modern battlefield and its myriad threats means that tank-on-tank warfare is not as probable nowadays as it once was, although Ukraine has shown the tank is not a dead concept by any means. But should it happen that the Republic of China Army has to face Chinese tanks in such a situation, the M1A2T Abrams at least offers a much higher level of capabilities than the tanks otherwise in Taiwanese service.

Drone Incursions Closed Wright Patterson Air Force Base’s Airspac...	The sprawling Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio is the latest military installation to report mysterious drones flying over its airspace, The War Zone has learned. 'I can confirm small aerial systems were spotted over Wright Patterson between Friday night and Saturday morning,' base spokesman Bob Purtiman told The War Zone on Sunday in response to our questions about the sightings. 'Today leaders have determined that they did not impact base residents, facilities, or assets. The Air Force is taking all appropriate measures to safeguard our installations and residents.' The drones 'ranged in sizes and configurations,' Purtiman said. 'Our units are working with local authorities to ensure the safety of base personnel, facilities, and assets.' The sprawling Wright Patterson AFB complex. (Google Earth) After the drones were seen over Wright Patterson, a Notice To Airman (NOTAM) was issued closing the airspace between Friday night and Saturday morning. The airspace has since been reopened, Purtiman said.

It's home to the Air Force Research Lab, Air Force Material Command, the 655th Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Wing, the National Air and Space Intelligence Center, the 445th Airlift Wing and the host 88th Air Base Wing, among other base tenants. The confirmation of drones over Wright Patterson came a day after the FBI, Department of Homeland Security, Federal Aviation Administration, and Defense Department (DoD) held a joint press conference to address the growing concern about sightings over the U.S., mostly in the airspace above New Jersey. The War Zone was the first to report the confirmation of drones being spotted over Picatinny Arsenal in that state. Since then, there has been a flood of mostly unconfirmed and erroneous reported sightings throughout New Jersey. Of more than 5,000 tips called into a national hotline set up to deal with these sightings, fewer than 100 generated leads 'deemed worthy of further investigation,' an FBI spokesman told reporters, including from The War Zone, on Saturday The overwhelming majority of these sightings, as we have previously reported, are crewed aircraft, the official reiterated on Saturday. 'Most of the reports of UAS have originated from the ground, with very, very few reports of UAS activities from pilots of manned aircraft,' said the FBI official, speaking on condition of anonymity. 'Overlaying the visual sightings reported to the FBI with approach patterns for Newark-Liberty, JFK, and LaGuardia airports - the density of reported sightings matches the approach patterns of these very busy airports, flights coming in throughout the night. This modeling is indicative of manned aviation being quite often mistaken with unmanned aviation or UAS.' Still, as we have reported in the past, there are several confirmed drone sightings in New Jersey reported by trained observers at Picatinny and Naval Weapons Station Earle in New Jersey. A Coast Guard vessel off New Jersey also had a recent encounter with drones. U.S. officials are still trying to discover the origin of drones that appeared over four U.S. Air Force Bases in the U.K., a story we first broke. They’ve been spotted over RAF Lakehheath, RAF Mildenhall, and RAF Feltwell, all within close proximity, and RAF Fairford, about 130 miles to the west. A stock picture of a 'No Drone Zone' sign and other warnings along the perimeter of RAF Lakenheath. Mark Kerrison/In Pictures via Getty Images Though the origin of these drones remains a mystery, DoD officials continue to claim that they are neither dangerous nor actions by foreign adversaries. 'We have no intelligence or observations that would indicate that they were aligned with a foreign actor or that they had malicious intent, but just kind of simply tell you we don't know. We have not been able to locate or identify the operators who are the points of origin,' the DoD official told reporters on Saturday. 'The main point is to deter the activity using some of our electronic means that can respond to most of these small commercial systems and deny them access to the airspace over our bases. We don't know what the activity is. We don't know &#8230; if it is criminal. But I will tell you that it is irresponsible. Here on the military side, we are just as frustrated with the irresponsible nature of this activity.' Such ambiguity is wearing thin on the public as people are increasingly demanding clarity from the federal government on the issue. Wright Patterson is just the latest in a long string of drone sightings over sensitive facilities and military capabilities. A few days ago, Ramstein Air Base in Germany joined the growing list of places registering unknown drone overflights. The U.S. Air Force has confirmed that there were drones seen over Ramstein Air Base in Germany. (Boris Roessler/picture alliance via Getty Images) TWZ has been on the leading edge of covering this topic for years and has broken multiple stories now about drone incursions over key U.S. bases and training ranges, as well as uncrewed aerial systems harassing American forces off the coasts of the United States and making worrisome overflights of important non-military sites. A spate of drone incursions over Langley Air Force Base in Virginia in December 2023, which TWZ was the first report on, has now become a particular focal point of concern about these instances. Most of the New Jersey drone sightings were misidentified, so it is notable that the ones spotted over Wright Patterson, as with the other U.S. military installations, were seen by trained observers that are equipped with high-end gear to maintain security and to discriminate between friend and foe. We will continue to provide additional details on the Wright Patterson AFB incident and the larger drone incursions story as we get them.
