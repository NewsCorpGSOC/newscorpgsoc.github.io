Northrop Grumman’s Mission Solutions Aim To Keep Fourth-Generatio...	Fourth-generation fighter aircraft continue to play critical roles in air forces around the world, even where operators are transitioning to more advanced fifth-generation platforms. The U.S. Air Force, for example, features more F-16s in its total force inventory than any other fighter aircraft type. The Viper’s future roadmap foresees it operating in an increasingly threatening battlespace and being tasked with tackling a multitude of complex mission sets. Faced with extended life-expectancy and a need to address current and emerging threats, fighters such as the F-16 are being heavily modernized in order to remain relevant, ensure their survivability, and to bridge the gap between what armed forces currently operate and aircraft types that they need for future warfare. 'Adversaries are advancing their capabilities at unprecedented rates,' says Jim Conroy, vice president, electronic warfare and targeting at Northrop Grumman. 'To maintain their operational relevance, the fourth- and fifth-generation fighter aircraft flown by the U.S. and international air forces need to consistently be updated with new capabilities over time.' A U.S. Air Force F-16C assigned to the 422nd Test and Evaluation Squadron. Jamie Hunter Northrop Grumman is continuously modernizing fourth-generation aircraft with advanced electronic warfare (EW), targeting and sensing capabilities for greater survivability, precision and resilience, while increasing interoperability across domains. They’ve developed, fielded, and iterated critical mission systems for the F-16 for more than five decades, and these upgrades have never been more relevant than they are today. Since the F-16’s inception, Northrop Grumman has been the sole radar provider for the F-16, and its electronic warfare systems have served for decades on the platform. 'F-16 operators rely on our deep-rooted experience to provide advanced capabilities that meet their future demands,' says Lindsay McEwen, vice president, combat sensors at Northrop Grumman. 'From mechanically-scanned (M-Scan) arrays to active electronically scanned arrays (AESA), and analog to digital EW systems, Northrop Grumman is no stranger to modernization, ensuring fleet sustainment and long-term operability for the F-16.' Spectrum dominance for the fourth-generation One key driver of modernization is the rapid growth in electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) warfare, where advanced electronic warfare and sensing capabilities are prerequisites for survivability and mission success. Northrop Grumman has addressed this need with their AN/ALQ-257 Integrated Viper Electronic Warfare Suite (IVEWS) and AN/APG-83 Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR). An image of a SABR during flight-testing. Northrop Grumman 'IVEWS was designed to give the F-16 capabilities on par with fifth-generation aircraft,' said Conroy. 'It provides both situational awareness and countermeasures, and its ultra-wideband architecture allows it to see and defeat more radio frequency [RF] threats.' 'SABR has been an integral part of F-16 modernization, enhancing performance and bringing agility to the platform with every variation,' says McEwen. 'SABR’s software-defined AESA technology requires fewer moving parts, providing reliability rates three-to-five times greater than traditional M-Scan radars. This translates to greater radar system availability and lower sustainment costs.' While each system is highly effective as a standalone capability, their designs are also fully interoperable, which means IVEWS is able to provide protection without interfering with SABR. For aircraft equipped with SABR, the addition of IVEWS allows for full lethality without compromising survivability. The AN/ALQ-257 Integrated Viper Electronic Warfare Suite, also known as IVEWS. Northrop Grumman Every mission begins with survivability 'With modern threats on the battlefield, it’s possible for a pilot to be in the weapons engagement zone and not be aware of it,' says Conroy. 'That is why it is so important for every platform to have robust electronic warfare protection against agile systems.' Recent operational assessment flight tests on two U.S. Air Force F-16s that have IVEWS permanently installed demonstrated the ability of IVEWS to detect such threats. During more than 50 flight hours, IVEWS performed exceptionally well against both airborne and ground-based threats in a demanding electromagnetic spectrum environment, Conroy added. Four F-16Cs seen flying during a training exercise. Jamie Hunter Critical for mission success, IVEWS provides a level of protection without interfering with the onboard AN/APG-83 SABR AESA. The two systems are digitally interoperable on a pulse-to-pulse basis, allowing for both IVEWS and SABR to operate simultaneously and at full capability during missions. In contrast, legacy systems used a blanking approach, which required one system to shut off briefly while the other operates – the electronic warfare system, for example, would be unable to detect threats while it is being blanked. Northrop Grumman has applied its expertise in ultra-wideband architectures to the other side of EMS operations – sensing via advanced AESA technology. Enhancing situational awareness to ensure air superiority In dense, fast-paced, air combat environments, where visibility is often drastically obscured, it’s nearly impossible to get a full picture of the landscape. A platform’s radar is the sole system that can pierce through the chaos. As the battlespace becomes more contested, modernizing fourth-generation fighters requires upgrading to the latest radar technology – AESA. SABR in production. Northrop Grumman 'Our industry-leading AESA technology brings SABR greater bandwidth to perform more accurately in hostile environments,' said McEwen. 'Its long-range detection, rapid scanning, and high-resolution mapping greatly enhances situational awareness, allowing warfighters to make faster and more accurate decisions.' Approximately 95 percent of SABR’s mode suite and hardware baseline design comes from Northrop Grumman’s highly successful fifth-generation AESA radars, including robust and proven electronic protection. This not only makes it a more sustainable and cost-effective platform, but the AESA software base enables interoperability with fifth-generation platforms, allowing real-time data sharing and collaboration. This is crucial in network-centric warfare where joint operations require a wider range of aircraft for mission success. Seeing farther with electro-optical/infrared systems To ensure pilots have necessary situational awareness and precise targeting capabilities throughout the spectrum, Northrop Grumman also provides the LITENING electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) targeting pod. LITENING has been in operation for 25 years with over 900 pods in service on 10 different aircraft types, now including the U.S. Navy F/A-18 Super Hornet. 'The latest variant of LITENING, known as Large Aperture [LA], has six high-definition sensors that allow the pilot to see targets and threats in color and in three infrared bands: mid-wave, short-wave and long-wave,' explains Conroy. 'The long-wave sensor will give the pod greatly enhanced air-to-air, passive targeting capabilities, and the best EO/IR situational awareness available to date.' LITENING LA provides fighters that are carrying the pod a capability which can be used to work in conjunction with the radar and other onboard sensors to better ascertain airborne threats at long distances. This means fighters carrying the pods are able to accurately identify and track even stealthy threats passively, making them better able to engage them with their weapons, at long range, without giving away their presence. A close view of the front end of a LITENING Large Aperture pod. Northrop Grumman Staying on track with jam-resistant navigation systems One threat pilots are likely to face in future conflicts is the degradation or jamming of GPS signals. Northrop Grumman’s LN-260M embedded global positioning/inertial navigation system, an upgraded version of the F-16’s current navigation system, is designed to enable aircrews to continue operations even when GPS is being jammed. 'The M-Code technology in LN-260M will give pilots a more secure, encrypted, and resilient, jam-resistant navigation signal,' says Conroy. 'This system independently knows its location without the need for GPS.' A Super Hornet carrying a LITENING pod. Northrop Grumman Maintaining fourth-generation relevance in the future fight Air forces worldwide will rely on the F-16 as a core component in combat operations into the foreseeable future. Ensuring these platforms can carry out their missions in concert with fifth- and future sixth-generation aircraft will require an ongoing commitment to maintaining the combat readiness of the fleet. By adding advanced systems that are affordable, small in size, low in weight, and efficient in power consumption (low-SWaP) and designed to leverage open architectures, fourth-generation aircraft are guaranteed to remain relevant over time. Northrop Grumman’s advanced mission solutions such as IVEWS, SABR, and LITENING are keeping the Viper and other fourth-generation aircraft secure, survivable, resilient and ready for precise operations in the complex conflict scenarios of the future, ensuring warfighters return home safely.

Ukraine’s SA-8 Gecko ‘FrankenSAM’ Adapted To Fire Air-To-Air Miss...	We have gotten our best look at a Ukrainian 9K33 Osa (SA-8 Gecko) mobile short-range air defense system (SHORADS) armed with the Soviet-era R-73 (AA-11 Archer) infrared-guided air-to-air missile. While other such systems have typically integrated Western missile armament on existing Ukrainian ground-based air defense systems — known as ‘FrankenSAMs’ — this one is notable for being a domestic initiative combining a Soviet-era SHORADS vehicle with Soviet-era air-to-air missiles. Close-up of an R-73 missile loaded on an Osa-AKM SHORADS vehicle. Come Back Alive Photos of the upgraded Cold War-era Osa were published by Come Back Alive, a Ukrainian foundation that provides support to Ukrainian Armed Forces service members, including purchasing arms and equipment and providing additional training. The photos show an Osa armed with a single R-73 missile mounted on a rail on the right-hand side of its existing missile/radar turret. While there’s capacity for another missile to be fitted on the left-hand side, this isn’t loaded in these views. In its original form, the Osa-AKM version operated by Ukraine carries six 9M33 series missiles in box-type containers, three on each side of the turret. Earlier versions of the Osa carried four missiles. Ukrainian 9K33 Osa-AKM systems on parade in Kyiv, before the full-scale Russian invasion. Віталій/Wikimedia Commons Otherwise, the upgraded Oka retains the usual fully amphibious six-wheeled BAZ-5937 transport vehicle chassis. Mounted on this, the turret of the upgraded Osa appears to have the same H-band elliptical surveillance antenna (shown in the folded position) and the J-band engagement antenna mounted at the front, which is flanked by a smaller missile tracking radar on each side. This is not the first time we’ve seen the upgraded Osa with R-73 missiles, with a previous, lower-quality photo emerging in the spring of this year, this time with two missiles loaded. At the time, it was reported that the modification involved adding the APU-73 missile rail (the usual interface between the R-73 and an aircraft pylon) and unspecified 'additional equipment.' Picture of a OSA Short Range Air Defence System using what looks to be R-73 missiles (Thanks to those here helping me ID it).A cropped version was originally posted back on 12/11/2023 ( pic.twitter.com/AaoPYwWspQ&mdash; Jeff2146 (@Jeff21461) May 18, 2024 The result was claimed to marginally increase the range of the SHORADS, compared with its original missile armament. The Osa-AKM, or SA-8B Gecko Mod-1, as used by Ukraine, originally was armed with 9M33M3 missiles that have a maximum range of 9.3 miles and a maximum altitude of up to 40,000 feet. The R-73, in air-launched form, has a maximum range of 18.6 miles against a head-on target of 8.7 miles against a tail-on target. A ground-launched application would have reduced range since the missile wouldn’t benefit from the speed and altitude parameters of the launch aircraft. In this case, it’s perhaps more relevant to look at the seeker range of the R-73, which would remain broadly the same for ground launch: 6.2-7.5 miles. While these figures seem to conflict with the claim that the surface-launched R-73 offers improved range over the original missile, it should be noted that the published performance figures for the 9M33M3 are very much under ideal conditions and in real-life engagements its range would be significantly less.

Photo by Libkos/Getty Images LIBKOS The program was said to be a response to the dwindling stocks of the original 9M33 series missiles for the Osa, which have been greatly depleted, especially in dealing with low-level Russian drones and cruise missiles. The Osa system is also used to deal with low-level fixed-wing and helicopter threats over the battlefield. On the other hand, R-73 missile rounds exist in much greater numbers, aided by the fact that important parts of the weapon — notably its infrared seeker — were built in Ukraine. As the standard close-range Soviet air-to-air missile, it was also issued to air force units in huge numbers. Today, it remains part of the standard armament for Ukrainian Air Force MiG-29 Fulcrum and Su-27 Flanker fighters. A schematic diagram of the R-73 missile. Public Domain According to the latest information published by Come Back Alive, the foundation invested over 14 million hryvnias (around $336 million) in the Osa upgrade project. Although it doesn’t reveal how many of the systems were upgraded, it notes that Osa regiments within the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine have received the upgraded systems. Adding to the flexibility of the system, the same launcher vehicle can be armed with R-73s or 9M33M3s, presumably also being configured with a mix of missiles if required.

Kuzmin/Wikimedia Commons In a major advantage over the 9M33 series, the R-73 uses infrared guidance, meaning it’s a ‘fire and forget’ missile. Once launched, the vehicle can move away from the firing position. Using the older missile, the vehicle needs to keep tracking the target and the missile, as well as sending guidance commands to the missile. The nose of an R-73 missile arming an upgraded Osa-AKM. The Mayak-80 infrared seeker was designed and manufactured by the Arsenal factory in Kyiv. Come Back Alive Also, as TWZ has discussed in previous coverage of the missile, the R-73 is a high-off-boresight (HOBS) weapon, with a seeker that can articulate in any direction much farther than a traditional heat-seeking air-to-air missile with a fixed non-HOBS seeker that stares directly forward. Aided by a helmet-mounted sight, the Archer can be launched in air-to-air engagements against targets with off-boresight angles of +/-75 degrees. This gives the R-73 the potential to be a particularly potent, albeit improvised threat for locking onto and engaging dynamic targets with minimal assisting sensors when used in a surface-launched form. Clearly, Ukraine has also developed a way of using this HOBS capability remotely to ensure this weapon is effective at all.

The Yemen-based Houthi militants, in particular, have adapted R-73s for surface launch against aircraft targets, and used them in combat, as you can read about here. While there are similarities with the FrankenSAM program, the fact that the upgraded Osa doesn’t require Western missiles — or other Western technical expertise — means that it can be undertaken entirely domestically. An R-73 air-to-air missile on display. Black bands on the weapon indicate an inert round. Vitaly V. Kuzmin/Wikimdia Commons While it doesn’t rely on continued deliveries of Western missiles, it’s conceivable that the Osa platform could also be configured to fire Western AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. These are fairly similar to the R-73, with the same infrared guidance principle. Examples of the Sidewinder have already been donated to Ukraine by its Western allies, for use in a FrankenSAM solution, although it’s still not clear what platform they have been integrated on. In the past, TWZ noted that the AIM-9 could lend itself to arming an upgraded Osa-based FrankenSAM. There is something of a precedent for this, with the Polish defense contractor PGZ having previously pitched a broadly similar Osa conversion with the European IRIS-T missile as its effector. Meanwhile, the first FrankenSAM system to be seen in detail in official imagery comprises a Soviet-era Buk (SA-11 Gadfly) mobile surface-to-air missile system armed with radar-guided RIM-7 Sea Sparrow missiles. However, the similar AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missile has also been provided to Ukraine and is also understood to be employed in one or more FrankenSAM versions. One of the first official photos of a so-called ‘FrankenSAM.’ It shows a tracked self-propelled Buk-M1 system which is said to have been adapted to fire the RIM-7 Sea Sparrow, a missile that previously provided point defense for numerous NATO and allied warships. Ukraine’s Operational Command East There is also understood to be a longer-range FrankenSAM that combines U.S.-designed Patriot surface-to-air missiles and their launchers with elements from existing Ukrainian air defense systems, which might include radars from the country’s S-300P (SA-10 Grumble) systems. Outside of the FrankenSAM program, it’s worth noting that Ukraine’s stocks of R-73s have also been exploited for surface launch from uncrewed surface vessels (USVs), better known as drone boats. Ukrainian USVs operating in the Black Sea have been seen armed with R-73s, to provide the USVs with protection against the Russian helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft that are increasingly being used to counter them, as well as to offer an offensive anti-air capability in the same theater. In May of this year, videos released by the Russian Ministry of Defense showed a Ukrainian USV armed with an R-73 coming under attack from a Russian Navy Ka-29 Helix-B assault helicopter. The USV performed some hard maneuvers to try and escape the Ka-29 but was eventually destroyed, apparently by gunfire.

However, more could have been lost because Oryx only tabulates losses for which it has visual confirmation.

Come Back Alive The camouflage scheme on this Ukrainian Osa-AKM suggests it might be one of those donated from Polish stocks. Come Back Alive Regardless, Ukraine clearly has enough surviving systems to make it worthwhile launching a multi-million-dollar upgrade initiative. Despite its age, the basic Osa remains effective and, within NATO, is in use with Bulgaria, Greece, Poland, and Romania. As we have noted in the past, any of these nations could potentially be willing to give up their Osa systems, especially if inventories were backfilled with more modern SHORADS systems. For now, the upgraded Osa will be a very welcome boost for the Ukrainian air defenses, with the ground-based air defense element, in particular, having been very heavily worked, especially in the face of large-scale Russian drone attacks that have struck across the country in recent months.

Plans For New Hardened Aircraft Shelters Notably Absent From New ...	Any plans the Air Force might have for new hardened aircraft shelters or other physical defenses at bases are prominently absent from a new infrastructure modernization strategy. This is despite acknowledgments that the service's facilities 'can no longer be considered a sanctuary' and that those facilities need to be better prepared to support operations 'even while under attack.' All of this comes amid a major debate that extends well beyond the Air Force about how best to defend key U.S. military infrastructure, especially from growing drone and missile threats, and with a particular eye toward a potential high-end fight with China. The Department of the Air Force (DAF; which also includes the U.S. Space Force) unveiled what is formally called the Installation Infrastructure Action Plan (I2AP) yesterday. I2AP puts heavy emphasis on modernizing and right-sizing base infrastructure across the United States and abroad, as well as improving installation resiliency against hostile attacks and natural disasters, particularly when it comes to their electrical power requirements. A picture of a new solar power array at Joint Base Pearl Harbor Hickam in Hawaii included with the I2AP rollout to underscore work already being done to improve power grid resiliency at Air Force bases. Photo courtesy of HNUEnergy/Joseph Cannon 'DAF installations can no longer be considered a sanctuary. To ensure competitiveness in a high-end conflict, DAF installations must be able to deliver combat power with enough speed and intensity to be decisive, even while under attack,' an introduction to I2AP says. 'From hypersonic technology to unmanned aerial systems to advanced cyber capabilities, our installations must meet these new challenges and effectively generate combat power.' 'Resilient installation infrastructure possesses the capability to sustain combat power projection by protecting against, responding to, and recovering from deliberate, accidental, or natural events that impede all-domain operations,' the new installation plan also says. 'They require an infrastructure foundation with near immediate ‘ability to recover’ timeframes and ensure that critical missions are capable of being carried out, despite facing threats or adversities.' 'In this current environment, the ability of our installations to be effective and project power is going to be the margin of victory in Great Power Competition. And we had better be ready,' Dr. Ravi Chaudhary, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Energy, Installations, and Environment, also said during a virtual talk yesterday on the I2AP rollout that the Air & Space Forces Association hosted. Great Power Competition is the term of art the U.S. military has used in recent years to refer to newly mounting national security challenges posed by near-peer (and even potentially peer) adversaries, particularly China. 'You take a look across our inventory, and you're like, well, there's a lot of concrete out there &#8230; Concrete scares our adversaries just as much as fifth-gen fighters [like the F-22 and F-35], because the ability to mobilize and the ability to move a force from point A to point B is going to require concrete,' Chaudhary added. 'And so when you look at what we're doing in Indo-Pacific &#8230; bringing all-new airfields like Tinian, couple other locations, and robusting places like JBER [Joint Base Elmendorf–Richardson], places like Eielson [Air Force Base], that's exactly what we need to do.' A satellite image taken on June 6, 2022, showing the beginnings of construction to expand Air Force infrastructure at Tinian International Airport. PHOTO © 2022 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION JBER and Eielson are both in Alaska. Tinian is a U.S. territory in the western Pacific that is part of the larger Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). The War Zone has reported in the past on efforts to expand air base infrastructure at these locations. Work on Tinian is explicitly intended to provide critical additional capacity to project airpower in the event that the massive and highly strategic Andersen Air Force Base on the neighboring island of Guam is put out of action for any reason. All of this makes the absence of any explicit mention of plans for new hardened infrastructure or other defensive capabilities more pronounced. As already noted, there is a major debate ongoing about the value of physical hardening as part of future base defense plans, which The War Zone has previously explored in detail. The Air Force has signaled some support for more hardened aircraft shelters and otherwise 'robusting' infrastructure as Dr. Chaudhary put it yesterday. At the same time, the service has also called into question the value of major investments in physical defenses. 'We are looking at things … [that] increase the survivability of the bases from which we operate,' Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin said at an event the American Enterprise Institute hosted back in October, according to Air & Space Forces Magazine. 'And then in the midst of a conflict, how we get the right equipment to the right place at the right time is not only a matter of protecting it with hardened shelters and maybe camouflage, concealment, and deception, but it’s also connectivity, to have that situational awareness.' 'There's two classic schools of thought for resiliency. One is armor and harden the heck out of things. And the other is go with diversity and proliferation,' Tim Grayson, Special Assistant to Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall, explained during a talk that the Air & Space Forces Association’s Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies hosted in July. 'And it's really the latter, you know, because what ends up happening is you can spend so much time and money and effort on hardening things that you start degrading your own capabilities. So without being able to go into the specifics, I think we've made huge strides of hitting resiliency, through tougher diversity and mass and quantity.' 'I’m not a big fan of hardening infrastructure,' Air Force Gen. Kenneth Wilsbach, then head of Pacific Air Forces, the service's, also said at a roundtable at the 2023 Air & Space Forces Association symposium. 'The reason is because of the advent of precision-guided weapons… you saw what we did to the Iraqi Air Force and their hardened aircraft shelters. They’re not so hard when you put a 2,000-pound bomb right through the roof.' Wilsbach is now head of Air Combat Command (ACC). A picture from a ceremony in 2020 marking the completion of construction of new hardened aircraft shelters at Kunsan Air Base in South Korea, where elements of the U.S. Air Force are forward-deployed. USAF Congress has notably pushed back on these positions, including in an open letter from 13 Republican lawmakers earlier this year that warned that 'in recent war games [conducted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank] simulating a conflict with China over Taiwan, 90 percent of U.S. aircraft losses occurred on the ground, rather than from air combat.' That missive did also acknowledge that 'constructing hardened shelters for all our air assets may not be economically feasible or tactically sensible.' The Air Force is also very actively invested in concepts of operations known collectively as Agile Combat Employment (ACE). ACE is centered on reducing vulnerability and increasing flexibility through the ability to deploy in irregular and unpredictable manners to a growing number of bases globally. New and improved Tactics, techniques, and procedures to camouflage those movements and otherwise deceive enemies are also part of the equation. It is important to stress that hardened shelters and other physical infrastructure are not answers by themselves to the multi-faceted threat ecosystem facing the Air Force. For the Department of the Air Force, broader base defense issues are also tied up in the 1948 Key West Agreement, which firmly delineated the service's roles and missions from those of the U.S. Army that it had split off from. Per that deal, the Army is in charge of defending Air Force bases at home and abroad from aerial threats. 'We know that, doctrinally, the Army has taken responsibility since the 1940s for air base air defense. We may have some questions on that,' Dr. Chaudhary said yesterday. 'We may want to enter in a broader discussion on what that's going to look like going forward, because right now, the threats are so localized and so tactical that we may want to have a broader discussion &#8230; and take on some of those mission sets going forward.'

US Army 'Frankly, I would be comfortable with the Department of the Air Force taking on the total defense/local defense of air bases as an organic mission, if the needed resources – human and financial, etc – were made available,' Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall had also said during a keynote speech at the Airlift/Tanker Association’s (ATA) annual symposium in November. As the I2AP strategy notes, all of this comes amid steadily expanding threats to bases across the U.S. military, at home and overseas, as well as to critical civilian infrastructure, especially from drones and missiles. Drones have become a particular hot-button issue amid a rash of worrisome and still-unexplained incidents, including incursions over Langley Air Force Base in Virginia last year and more recently multiple U.S. facilities in the United Kingdom, as well as sightings in the skies above New Jersey. The War Zone, which was the first to report on all of these events, has repeatedly pointed out over the years that the dangers posed by uncrewed aerial systems are hardly new and are still growing, and that the barrier to entry is low. The Pentagon just recently announced a new department-wide counter-drone strategy, which acknowledges these threats, but also underscores the U.S. military's continued lag in addressing them, which you can read more about here. It's worth noting here that authorities at Langley, as well as Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina, have already been looking into the possibility of erecting anti-drone nets or other passive defenses to help protect against uncrewed aerial threats. A graphic offering general details about sunshade-type shelters at Langley Air Force Base that might now be in line to receive anti-drone nets. USAF New and improved cruise and ballistic missiles, as well as novel hypersonic weapons, also present particular concerns for U.S. military bases globally. These are threats not limited to Great Power Competition, with smaller nation-states and even non-state actors increasingly fielding more capable stand-off missiles. 'I think we're going to start thinking more broadly about what contested homeland operations look like, and so look to something coming out,' Dr. Chaudhary did also say yesterday toward the end of his talk. 'Our Secretary [Kendall] has made a few statements on that, that we may be open to taking that mission [base defense] on in the future. So we're excited about this. We're going to talk about it, but, so, to come in the future.' So, more may be coming soon from the Air Force about its plans for physical hardening of bases and/or other defensive measures.

Coast Guard Ship Stalked By Unidentified Aircraft, Iran Drone Mot...	The Pentagon on Wednesday shot down a statement by a New Jersey Congressman that there is an 'Iranian mothership off the coast of the United States launching&#8230; drone incursions.' The claim by U.S. Rep. Jeff Van Drew came as more and more people are seeing things in the sky they believe to be drones, blurring the line between hysteria and real national security concerns. The War Zone was the first to report about the New Jersey sightings that have since reached a fever pitch in the national consciousness. At the same time, the U.S. Coast Guard has confirmed an incident with one of their ships off New Jersey that was followed by unidentified aircraft. 'Iran Launched a Mothership' Rep.

The command was recently given the authority to synchronize the U.S. military's response to drone incursions.

While officials dismissed the mother ship claim, the Coast Guard on Wednesday confirmed that 'multiple low-altitude aircraft were observed in the vicinity of one of our vessels near Island Beach State Park, New Jersey,' LT Luke Pinneo said in a statement. 'While no immediate threats or disruptions to operations were identified, the Coast Guard is assisting the FBI and state agencies to understand the type, origin, and intent of these aircraft and address potential risks to safety and security. We take any and all aircraft activity near federal assets seriously and urge the public to report any suspicious activity to local authorities.' The Coast Guard statement came in response to our questions about claims made by U.S. Rep. Chris Smith on Tuesday that a 47-foot Coast Guard ship 'was followed by between 12 and 30 of these drones as they went through the water — followed, right behind them.' Actual Jersey Shore:A Commanding Officer in New Jersey Coast Guard told Rep. Chris Smith his 47-foot ship 'was followed by between 12 and 30 of these drones as they went through the water — followed, right behind them,' Smith told FBI, DOJ & CBP officials today. pic.twitter.com/avbizOtblL&mdash; Matt Laslo (@MattLaslo) December 10, 2024 That the Coast Guard quickly confirmed unidentified aircraft flew over one of its vessels is in stark contrast to how the Navy handled drone flights over its warships off the southern California coastline. As we were the first to report from a response to our federal Freedom of Information Act query, the mysterious swarming of U.S. Navy ships off the Southern California occurred over multiple days. You can read more about that in our reporting from the time here. Though it denied the Iranian mothership claim, NORTHCOM is taking reports about drones flying over New Jersey seriously. 'We are aware and monitoring the reports of unauthorized drone flights in the vicinity of military installations in New Jersey to include Picatinny Arsenal and Naval Weapons Station Earle,' the command said. It deferred comment about what actions are being taken in response to those installations. 'U.S. Northern Command conducted a deliberate analysis of the events, in consultation with other military organizations and interagency partners, and at this time we have not been requested to assist with these events,' NORTHCOM explained. 'If these incidents require additional DoD assistance, the Secretary of the Military Department or relevant DoD component head concerned can coordinate with USNORTHCOM for an enhanced or increased response. USNORTHCOM, in conjunction with our interagency partners, will continue to assess further information and is prepared to respond when asked or should the situation escalate to threaten any DoD installations.' #USNORTHCOM Statement regarding reports of drone activity in New Jersey.

On Dec. 3 spokesman Tim Rider told us that 'Picatinny Arsenal Police Department did receive an unconfirmed report on Monday evening. Because it is an active investigation, please direct any further queries on the topic to the FBI.' U.S. Army photo Naval Weapons Station Earle confirmed to us today that there was 'at least one instance of an unidentified drone entering the airspace above Naval Weapons Station Earle,' facility spokesman William Addison told us. He declined to specify when the incursion happened, what type of drones, or how the base responded. The facility, located in Colts Neck, New Jersey about 20 miles south of New York City, 'is aware of the reports of increased drone activity in New Jersey and Monmouth County and we are actively monitoring the situation,' Addison added. 'We have received reports from our neighboring communities and law enforcement partners regarding drone activity near the installation.' The FBI, which is leading the investigation into the drone sightings, told us it had no updates on Wednesday In addition to the two military installations, authorities say spottings of drones above critical infrastructure including reservoirs, electrical transmission lines, rail stations and police departments have occurred. The issue of drone incursions has become so concerning that Congress on Tuesday held a hearing on the matter. Robert Wheeler Jr., assistant director of the Critical Incident Response Group for the FBI, testified that the bureau has few details about the incursions, which began on Nov. 18 over Picatinny and the surrounding area and have since spread all over New Jersey. 'The bureau is actively investigating the unexplained sighting of drone activity over that part of New Jersey, including proximity to sensitive sites and areas of concern,' Wheeler explained. 'We do not attribute that to an individual or group yet. I don't have an answer of who's responsible, one or more people that are responsible, but we're actively investigating.'

Phil Murphy told reporters that he has spoken with White House officials about the ‘very sophisticated’ drones over New Jersey. 'The minute you get eyes on them, they go dark… This is something we’re taking deadly seriously.' While speaking at an unrelated bill signing event in Princeton, Murphy noted there were 49 reports of drones on Sunday, mostly in Hunterdon County, according to The Associated Press. Murphy explained that those numbers 'included possible sightings and potentially the same drone being reported more than once.' 'This is something we’re taking deadly seriously. I don’t blame people for being frustrated,' Murphy said.

Responding to the spate of drone incursions, the FAA enacted two Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs) prohibiting drone flights without prior permission over Picatinny Arsenal and the Trump National Golf Course Bedminster without permission. The Picatinny TFR went into effect Nov. 25 and ends Dec. 26 while the one over Trump National was initiated Nov. 22 and slated to end Dec. 6, but was subsequently extended to Dec. 20 Officials at Trump National could not be reached for comment on Tuesday and have yet to respond to our first query when we asked about possible drone incursions over or near the facility back on Nov. 20. Drones can be operated over those locations in support of national defense, homeland security, law enforcement, firefighting, search and rescue or natural disaster response, as well as event operations and approved commercial flights, according to the TFR. Any drones violating the restriction are subject to 'the interference, disruption, seizing, damaging or destruction of the unmanned [aircraft]' by the Defense Department, Department of Homeland Security or the Department of Justice,' the TFRs note.

(FAA) In a statement, the FAA said last week it had 'received reports of drone activity near Morris County, New Jersey, on Monday, Nov. 18. At the request of federal security partners, the FAA published two Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs) prohibiting drone flights' over the base and golf course. It is unclear if any drones flew over the Trump golf course. 'We look into all reports of unauthorized drone operations and investigate when appropriate,' the statement continued. 'Drone operators who conduct unsafe operations that endanger other aircraft or people on the ground could face fines up to $75,000. In addition, we can suspend or revoke drone operators’ pilot certificates.' Trump has been threatened with drone attacks before. Nearly four years ago, Iran made a veiled threat of a drone strike on Trump with an image posted on social media. It depicted what appeared to be the shadow of one of Iran’s flying wing-type unmanned aircraft — designs that are supposedly derived, at least in its shape, from a captured U.S. RQ-170 stealth drone — some of which are capable of dropping small munitions, looming over a figure that seems clearly intended to represent Trump taking a swing on a golf course. That tweet, by ran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was in retaliation for the death of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani ordered by Trump. It led to his account being banned. You can see an image from the tweet below. This image in this tweet caused Twitter to ban the account of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in 2021. (Twitter sceen cap) www.twz.com Large drones 'have been hovering in formation over northern New Jersey, officials said last week, leading to 'unnerved' residents wondering what's behind these bright, unidentified flying objects appearing almost every night in the sky,' NBC News reported. In addition to the FBI, the Morris County Sheriff's Department is also actively investigating the aerial phenomenon, 'which has been an annoyance but not yet any kind of safety threat, authorities said,' according to the network. The image provided by a witness claiming to be one of those drones was in reality a commercial airliner, as you can see below. This has been the case constantly in reporting across the mainstream media space. Large drones have been hovering in formation over northern New Jersey, officials say, leading to 'unnerved' residents wondering what's behind these bright, unidentified flying objects appearing almost every night in the sky. NBC News (@NBCNews) December 3, 2024 Though the concern about drones flying over military installations and other sensitive locations is legitimate, nearly all of the videos and imagery TWZ has reviewed are of private and commercial aircraft. There is also growing speculation that many of these objects are UFOs, or what the Pentagon now refers to as unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs). However, a spokesperson for the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), the Pentagon office that handles these matters, told us that it 'received no reports of UAP in conjunction with recent drone flights or incursions in the New Jersey area.' There are a number of reasons why sightings are being misidentified. 'Nearly every video I have seen has pointed to mass hysteria not a drone invasion of massive scale, with airliners, private jets, and helicopters being portrayed as mysterious objects,' TWZ editor-in-chief explained on Twitter. 'These videos are peddled for engagement by a growing number of online accounts. This is very unfortunate, because there does seem to be something going on here, but zero critical thought, even on a most basic level of the 'evidence' only fuels rumors and fear. It also clogs the channels for relevant evidence to break through. This is true on a public consumption and governmental/investigative level. It also puts aircraft in danger.' Mailbox/DMs etc full of people asking why we are not reporting on the drone stuff considering we broke all this over many years. We are! But we have not been doing a play by play as the story has totally gone off the rails with reality and major news stories have developed…&mdash; Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) December 11, 2024 During Wednesday's press briefing, we asked Singh to tell us how the Pentagon views the legitimacy of many of these drone claims. 'The initial assessments are that these are drones, and potentially could be small airplanes. It could be a number of things that people are seeing and reporting. That's, you know, for the investigation to uncover, and so I can't speak to that more in terms of a frenzy.' 'I think it's completely right that people report these sightings and that there is an investigation into what they are seeing,' she added. 'But I think what's also important to remember is that at no time were our military institute installations, or are people ever under any threat, and if they were, of course, the base commanders have the ability to engage these drones if they do pose a threat.' There are several impediments, however, to defending against drones. Given current rules and regulations, the U.S. military isn’t currently interested in fielding kinetic and directed energy capabilities, such as laser and high-power microwave weapons, surface-to-air interceptors, and gun systems, for defending domestic bases and other critical infrastructure from rapidly growing and evolving drone threats. Instead, the focus is on systems that provide drone detection, as well as electronic warfare and cyber warfare, and other ‘soft-kill’ options, at least for the time being. You can read more about in our deep dive here. With so many agencies involved in investigating the drone incursions, the government's message has been muddled at a best. That's added to the confusion. When the drones first appeared over Picatinny, the military offered public comments. Then the FBI came in and provided no details. Elected officials began to fill the void, adding to the growing alarm to the point where Congress had to intervene. Now the Pentagon is involved. As TWZ's editor discussed in his X post earlier today, this has led to a major hysteria: 'The mainstream media has no clue what they are talking about on this issue, none, and most outlets largely don't seem to care. Local officials are very poor sources in terms of quality info on this issue. This is not a dig on them at all, it's just there is not an in-house knowledge base there that understands it, just facets of it, not anywhere near a whole picture. This is a very complex issue with many technological facets. You don't just call in a 'drone guy' and get briefed. We have ran into this issue many times. The U.S. gov messaging on this has been so absurdly poor and frankly dangerous, there is a story there we are working on, but that isn't all that surprising. This has been the way it has been for years, but at least the denials have finally evaporated&#8230;' 'But beware of the prevailing narrative and especially what you see portrayed on social media, this is now a hype train and everyone is jumping on, and many are doing so for the wrong reasons. I applaud those that are doing the opposite&#8230;' Mailbox/DMs etc full of people asking why we are not reporting on the drone stuff considering we broke all this over many years. We are! But we have not been doing a play by play as the story has totally gone off the rails with reality and major news stories have developed…&mdash; Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) December 11, 2024 The growing hysteria over this issue clouds the fact that real drones pose a significant national security threat. While the Pentagon has repeatedly claimed that there is no indication of a foreign connection to the drone incursions, a Chinese national was arrested earlier this week for flying a drone over Vandenberg Space Force Base. Yinpiao Zhou, 39, is charged with failure to register an aircraft not providing transportation and violation of national defense airspace, according to the Justice Department. Zhou was arrested on Dec. 10 at San Francisco International Airport before boarding a China-bound flight and is expected to make his initial appearance tomorrow in United States District Court in San Francisco. On Nov. 30, 'drone detection systems at Vandenberg Space Force Base in Santa Barbara County detected a drone flying over the base,' the Justice Department release stated. 'The drone systems detected that the drone flew for nearly one hour, traveled to an altitude of almost one mile above ground level, and originated from Ocean Park, a public area next to the base. Base security personnel went to the park, spoke to Zhou and another person accompanying him, and learned that Zhou had a drone concealed in his jacket – the same one that flew over the base.' After obtaining a warrant to search his drone, agents found 'several photographs of Vandenberg Space Force Base taken from an aerial viewpoint. A search of Zhou’s cellphone showed Zhou conducted a Google search approximately one month earlier for the phrase 'Vandenberg Space Force Base Drone Rules' and messaged with another person about hacking his drone to allow it to fly higher than it could otherwise.' Vandenberg is a key military installation, where ICBM and missile defense tests, as well as many other space launch activities occur, among other missions.

Those incursions began two days after the first Picatinny drone sightings.

Mark Kerrison/In Pictures via Getty Images These are just the latest in a long string of drone sightings over sensitive facilities and military capabilities. TWZ has been on the leading edge of covering this topic for years and has broken multiple stories now about drone incursions over key U.S. bases and training ranges, as well as uncrewed aerial systems harassing American forces off the coasts of the United States and making worrisome overflights of important non-military sites. A spate of drone incursions over Langley Air Force Base in Virginia in December 2023, which TWZ was the first report on, has now become a particular national cause celebre. The interest in these incursions is growing every day and statements like the one about the Iranian mothership drive the story to new heights, regardless of the accuracy. We will continue to cover these issues and provide the truth, in both fact and context, as best we can.

Inside T-7 Red Hawk Test Operations At Edwards AFB	The U.S. Air Force’s new advanced jet trainer aircraft, the Boeing T-7A Red Hawk, is deeply engaged in an accelerating and expanding flight test program at Edwards Air Force Base in California. The USAF’s need for the Red Hawk is acute, with aged T-38 Talons bearing a heavy pilot training burden as Air Education And Training Command (AETC) struggles to meet pilot output targets. The T-7 is designed to improve aircraft availability and it incorporates technology meant to accelerate training. 'The T-7A is a generational change over the T-38 that’s going to open up a lot of options for AETC,' says Lt. Col. Jonathan 'Gremlin' Aronoff, the T-7A Integrated Test Force director. A team of Air Force and Boeing pilots and engineers are working with the new trainer to generate sufficient data and confidence to endorse that the aircraft is ready for students and instructors to fly and that the Red Hawk meets contractual requirements that would green-light Boeing to commence low-rate initial production. One of the T-7A Production Relevant Jets, known as BTX-1, lands at Edwards AFB after a test flight. Jamie Hunter Delays in the T-7 program have compounded USAF pilot training struggles, as detailed in May 2023 by Andrew Hunter, the assistant secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. 'Due to issues discovered in the early development and test phase of the program, the Air Force is delaying its Milestone C decision to initiate the buy of T-7A production aircraft. This will shift the T-7A program’s initial operational capability [IOC] into the Spring of 2027. We are pursuing risk reduction activities to mitigate some of these schedule challenges,' Hunter said in 2023. However, significant progress is being made, with Red Hawks now flying with the Integrated Test Force at Edwards AFB, which is breeding confidence that the program is making good progress. 'Everyone here is eager for the test work so we can get the airplane to AETC as fast as possible. They need the T-7A and we want to give it to them as quickly and as safely as we can,' adds Aronoff. 'We definitely don’t have any excessive pressure on us, it’s very much about working methodically to get the Air Force something it needs, and everyone's being incredibly respectful of how we do that.' T-7A Red Hawk origin The Boeing T-7A advanced jet trainer was selected in 2018 to replace the USAF’s geriatric T-38C Talons, but the Red Hawk is already three years behind its original schedule, and is now planned to enter service in 2027. The original timeline called for Boeing to start delivering the first T-7As to the USAF at Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph, Texas, from 2023 to commence initial instructor pilot training, ahead of IOC in 2024, which is defined as being a 'fully fitted-out squadron of aircraft and training devices.' Boeing was awarded a $9.2-billion contract by the USAF in September 2018 to supply 351 T-7As and 46 associated ground-based training simulators when it won the T-X trainer competition. Initial flight-test work was conducted out of Boeing’s St. Louis, Missouri, facility using a pair of 'Production Relevant Jets,' or PRJs, that Boeing built for the T-X competition phase. Following the contract award, Boeing started T-7A production at St. Louis with a static test article (STA) and the first of five engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) aircraft. Boeing said in early 2021 that the STA would be complete in 'a couple of months' and that it featured a 'significant amount of instrumentation' that would allow it to be compared against the digital modeling and prove out the service life goal of 8,000 flight hours for each T-7A. Flight-testing at St. Louis with the two PRJs continued and revealed some widely reported handling issues, such as wing-rock at high angles of attack. Further delays have been incurred by the need to clear a wide tolerance envelope for the aircraft’s escape system, which is based around the Collins Aerospace ACES 5 ejection seat. Specifically, this relates to safe ejection for different aircrew body weights, particularly regarding lighter-weight pilots. While the T-7A was digitally designed and manufactured from digital models using a methodology called full-size determinant assembly [FSDA], this hasn’t removed the need for rigorous flight testing and certification to verify that the modeling and simulations are accurate. The all-digital approach hasn’t removed all development risk, and test work has required additional time to be allocated for re-visiting problematic items. Although the low-rate initial production decision date has been delayed beyond February 2025, a decision is still anticipated by February 2026. Edwards testing The first of five EMD T-7As arrived at Edwards on November 8, 2023. It was followed by a second EMD jet and one of Boeing’s two PRJs – taking the test fleet at Edwards to three aircraft by the time of TWZ’s visit in October 2024. 'Testing will continue until we feel we can give the end user a product that they can use,' said Aronoff. 'When the program office and AETC decide to declare Milestone C, that’s when they'll start building low-rate initial production airplanes.' 'We work for Air Force Materiel Command and the Air Force Test Center. Specifically, the T-7 Integrated Test Force comes under the Air Power Foundation's Combined Test Force. We have three ITFs under this – the T-7 ITF, the F-16/T-38 ITF, and the Emerging Technologies ITF.' The first T-7A Red Hawk assigned to testing at Edwards AFB was the second engineering and manufacturing development aircraft. USAF/Todd Schannuth Todd Schannuth 'Everything we are doing in T-7 flight test is based on proving the contract, proving out all the things that the aircraft is supposed to do, and that starts with safety of flight and building up the flight envelope – how fast, how far, how high. It’s about verifying that the airplane is doing the things it's supposed to do per the letter of the contract.' The flying at Edwards typically sees T-7As being crewed with one Boeing and one Air Force pilot, with all maintenance being conducted under contract by the manufacturer. 'We're very much hand-in-hand and integrated together,' explains Aronoff. 'We are the lead developmental test organization [LDTO] and Boeing is our partner, and we stay in lockstep with them. We make sure that when we're going to test something that they agree it’s something we should be testing, that the conditions are appropriate and that we're testing it in the correct way. It’s about making sure we are going after the right data in the right way to satisfy the contractual obligations to develop the airplane.' 'Currently, we are engaged in flight envelope expansion. We have one of the PRJ T-7s fitted with a spin-recovery parachute and we're using it to open up the high angle-of-attack envelope and fly the departure resistance type of flight testing,' Aronoff explained. 'We also have two EMD jets currently, one is instrumented for loads, noise, and vibration testing – opening up the structural envelope and understanding how the structure handles different maneuvers over time. This is about monitoring fatigue. We want to make sure that the engineering models for the T-7 are correct. We do that by measuring discrete test points – altitude, airspeed, and g-force combinations to verify that the model predictions are accurate.' 'The second EMD airplane at Edwards is our flutter test airplane. Think of the interaction between the structure of the airplane and the air around it. Think vibrations and the harmonics of the flight controls, and that's needed to open up the air speed envelope. We go to different altitudes and run flutter programs in the flight control system, which automatically shakes the airplane at different frequencies and amplitudes to try to excite a response. We can target specific amplitudes and frequencies that we are interested in and we can be very precise in how we gather data.' The second engineering and manufacturing development T-7A flies over Edwards AFB. USAF Bryce Bennett Aronoff says the T-7 work is the most precise flying he’s ever done. 'You have a control room of about 30 people watching your every move, and sometimes they tell you that what you flew wasn't good enough. You are trying something multiple times and they tell you that they need a cleaner set of data, but they can’t feel the turbulence, can't feel the heat of the mission, and they ask you to go do it again. That’s my job, to gather data for the engineers to verify the airplane is doing what it's supposed to do.' 'Right now, we're still very much building that safe envelope to operate in and flying with kid gloves. I need to be very precise in how I fly the aircraft. We’re talking plus or minus a couple of knots, plus or minus 50 feet, executing a certain amount of g, plus or minus 0.2g normally. Very tight tolerances, because we need as clean of a data set as possible. We're streaming that data in real-time to the control room so they can look at the squiggles and make sure it’s the right amplitude, the right frequency, and do real-time analysis. If it’s a good data point, we can move on to the next event.' 'With our high angle-of-attack campaign, when we do a maneuver, and see if the aircraft responds the way we thought it was going to respond? As long as it's matching our model, we keep marching along. It's when there's a slight deviation from the model we have to look at why it deviated to check that it’s within acceptable bounds. Our loads tests are conducted in the same way. When I pull 6g, is the g-distribution around the airplane matching the model? In flight testing we predict, test, validate. We predict results, we then go out and test, and then we validate the model that we use to predict.' The third EMD T-7 completed a month-long trial of extreme weather inside the McKinley Climatic Laboratory in Florida earlier this year and it's now back in St. Louis for technical order validation and verification. 'They're verifying that the manuals for maintenance are written properly and accurately. EMD four is being used right now to do some ground testing for a new flight control law that's coming out, and the fifth jet is still in production,' says Aronoff. A T-7A Red Hawk seen frozen in the McKinley Climatic Laboratory chamber at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, in early 2024. USAF/Samuel King Jr. Samuel King Jr. 'I really want to stress the partnership. We are together on this every step of the way, and drawing on Boeing’s experience and expertise that they have already built with the T-7. While the two PRJ aircraft did do a lot of really great stuff for the program, ultimately, there are changes between the PRJs and EMD jets, so we have to be very deliberate in our engineering mindset on how we develop the airplane.' Boeing implemented a number of modifications to the EMD T-7s to address lessons learned from the PRJs, and Aronoff is keen to stress that the current test effort at Edwards has earned a lot of credit for the work that Boeing did with the PRJs early on. 'The outer mold line of the airplane is essentially the same, but things like the onboard computers have changed, the software we're running is a little bit different and there are small changes throughout the airplane that are different enough that we need to verify them.' 'Manufacturing design is a very difficult time in flight testing, especially in developmental work because if you find anything wrong, you're generally going to have to stop, investigate, then come up with a fix before you continue,' Aronoff explained. 'So by nature of where we are in testing, we expect a slower schedule than anyone would really want.' 'No program has ever gone through testing on its original software. We're going to find things that need attention, and that’s our job. If I'm not finding things, I'm not looking hard enough. In general, there's always things in the operational flight program software that we can do better. The contract and the requirements are spelled out for us, and so we continue to iterate on things until it meets the contract requirement – that's the measure of performance.' 'Our duty is to get the airplane fielded as quickly as it makes sense to, so that it's safe. If you think, for example, of the worst instructor pilot and the worst student pilot combination ever, we have to make it safe enough for them. Yet we also have to make the airplane able to challenge the next Chuck Yeager, so it’s really finely tuned to suit the best of the best as well as those that need a little more help.' The changing world of military pilot training Military pilot training is evolving. Fighter aircraft have become easier to fly in some respects, but they feature increasingly complex mission systems and information flow. Holding airspeed, altitude, and heading is still important for young aviators, but the emphasis in training has evolved to include employing the weapon system effectively to help streamline the path to advanced front-line fighters. 'The T-7 is a very high-performance airplane. It’s very powerful with a lot of thrust, and it will be a great challenge for student pilots. I wouldn’t say that stick and rudder skills aren't important – they're extremely important – but they aren’t the most important thing that we need to emphasize in modern pilot training. One of the big elements that separates the T-7A from the T-38 is the ability to download mission system tasks into the cockpit,' Aronoff explains. 'Theoretically on day one of pilot training, a student could be logging onto a data link, could be setting up different screens and fighting that information overload. Ultimately, the end user [Air Education and Training Command] will tailor a syllabus to build the product, in this case the student pilot that they need. We are providing a tool that enables that.' BTX-1 and the first engineering and manufacturing development T-7A fly together over Edwards AFB. USAF Christian Turner The T-7A cockpit features a side-stick control column and a customizable large area display, or LAD. 'You can have up to four different portals up, including mini portals, and you can have a different format for each portal,' Aronoff explains. 'It’s extremely customizable, which is going to challenge the students in terms of managing all of the information. They will need to decide what’s important, and what isn’t. What size screen do they want, how will they use the HOTAS [hands-on throttle-and-stick] controls, or are they going to use their fingers, because it's a touchscreen display. How do they find the information they’re looking for, and what information do they want displayed at any one time?' 'The student can fly, for example, with a moving map on the right screen, a weapons display in the middle screen, and maybe a simulated targeting pod on the left screen. Will the display look like a Raptor display, an F-35, an F-16? No, but all the relevant data is there. That’s not to say the jet isn’t capable of doing that in the future. It just wasn’t a requirement for the T-7A to mirror any specific aircraft’s displays.' The T-7 ITF is primarily evaluating the T-7A from an Undergraduate Pilot Training, or UPT, perspective. The first step in jet training. However, it also has a keen eye on the future application of the T-7 in the follow-on introduction-to-fighter fundamentals, or IFF, which is being taken into consideration. 'Every time we fly the airplane, even now, we’re looking at how an instructor would employ it. Every time I’m in the back seat of the T-7A I’m thinking like a UPT instructor. We have a diverse team here with T-38, F-15, F-16, and F-35 guys, and as we test the T-7A we evaluate it for future profiles that we will tackle later on in the program, such as an introduction-to-fighter fundamentals profile, where a student and instructor will go and fly a BFM [basic fighter maneuvres] sortie, for example.' The T-7A is not equipped with a radar or targeting pod, and sensor data is synthetically generated in the avionics for training purposes, and can be shared via data link. The aircraft cannot carry any training weapons such as practice bombs and weapons employment in training will all be simulated. In fact, the only external store the T-7A is mandated to carry is a travel cargo pod. AETC is concurrently working closely with Boeing on development of the T-7A simulator, which will be an important part of the overall syllabus. Aronoff says that right now for every hour of live flying the team undertakes, it spends two or three hours in the simulator honing the different mission profiles. 'For all of the data-gathering maneuvers we need to fly on a sortie, we rehearse them in the simulator. At Edwards we currently just have the one simulator and we also make a lot of use of the Boeing simulator that they have in St. Louis.' USAF and Boeing test pilots are jointly undertaking test flights at Edwards AFB. Jamie Hunter 'One of the big things I always get asked about as a T-38 instructor is landing from the back seat of the T-7A. In the T-38 this is somewhat of a traumatic experience, with very limited forward visibility. I’m pleased to say that the T-7 tandem cockpit has much better forward visibility thanks to that stadium seating.' Breaking new ground Unlike the 1950s and 60s, when new military aircraft types were emerging with regularity, the T-7A program is one of the rare times in modern military aviation where a brand new aircraft type is being flight-tested. 'Almost every time we fly the T-7 here at Edwards we're doing something that's never been done in the airplane before. That’s exciting because I can say I'm the first person to go this fast or this high in the airplane. Some people look at me strangely when I tell them I'm really excited about putting this airplane out of control and doing departure suitability testing. We’re doing brand new developmental testing on a brand new airplane.' 'I like to emphasize that it can be a straight pilot training aircraft, where you fly and learn how to do aerobatics, learn how to land a jet, things like that. You can also tailor it in a live virtual constructive [LVC] environment where you have three or four actual wingmen with you fighting your classmates who are down on the ground in the simulator. The instructor can ramp up or down the scenarios, whatever the student or the training desires.' 'Fundamentally, the way we're going to produce pilots will change. They can learn how to turn on the radar on their first flight in the T-7 if they want that. Students that are doing well and flourishing are going to be able to move forward a lot quicker with the T-7.' 'Ultimately, it’s up to AETC to decide how they want to unlock all of these features, but with the T-7 we have all the right tools in place to dramatically advance military pilot training in the USAF.'

V-BAT Drone Has Proven Its Ability To Operate In Heavily-Conteste...	Shield AI’s novel vertical take-off and landing V-BAT drone is growing in stature, with steadily increasing orders, a new variant, and most notably with a recent series of successful missions flown over Ukraine. While in that war zone the drones were able to deliver reliable effects despite operating in the most dense electronic warfare combat environment in the world. V-BATs were initially tested in Ukraine in June 2024 to evaluate how they performed in the face of just this kind of enemy interference. According to a Ukrainian report the V-BATs were able to operate unhindered, even when they flew very close to Ukrainian jamming systems. A follow-up battlefield experiment in Ukraine in August saw V-BATs locate Russian surface-to-air missile (SAM) batteries before relaying targeting data back to Ukrainian forces so that M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HiMARS, could attack and destroy the SAM sites. V-BAT trials in Ukraine proved extremely successful. Shield AI The Ukraine experiments clearly demonstrated how V-BAT is able to operate in a highly complex modern battlespace, with its embedded artificial intelligence working hand-in-hand with its suite of onboard sensors. As a package, the V-BAT offers a relatively low-cost unmanned aerial system (UAS) capability with significant endurance that can take off and land nearly anywhere and can operate in cooperative swarms to tackle complex missions. These include intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and targeting tasks in higher-threat environments. Armor Harris is Shield AI’s vice president of aircraft engineering, where he leads the development of V-BAT. Harris came to Shield AI from SpaceX, where he was the responsible engineer for developing the propulsive landing capability on Falcon 9 and was also head engineer for the Starlink satellite constellation. 'In Ukraine, there has been a massive emphasis on a fourth-generation fighter capability in the form of the F-16, yet F-16s can’t get anywhere close to the front-line because of the surface-to air-missile [SAM] systems that are prevalent here,' Harris says. 'V-BAT is able to operate without GPS in a hostile communications-jamming environment. It can fly into an area, locate and identify targets, and fly missions way out ahead of fighter aircraft. Historically, the suppression of enemy air defense [SEAD] mission has been considered to be a role for fighter aircraft, but now we’ve proved in Ukraine that a V-BAT in the danger zone can team with a stand-off weapon such as HiMARS to execute the mission, which is a very effective strategy.' Shield AI's Armor Harris, pictured in the center. Shield AI The V-BAT’s ability to persist in areas where GPS isn’t reliable is a key part of its effectiveness, according to Harris. 'Part of being able to fly without GPS is about knowing where you are without GPS. If you're able to do that, you just need to refine that position estimate enough to generate target quality grids and tracks, and then pass that data back. V-BAT has a navigation system that doesn't require GPS, and a communications system that's able to operate in that highly jammed environment. We've put it up against the best jammers that Russia has, and it's been able to take those head-on.' 'We see a lot of small, one-way attack drones in Ukraine, but what makes V-BAT unique is that there’s nothing else in the theater that is comparable in its size category, that can be driven around in a truck, can launch vertically from pretty much anywhere, and carry sensors that are comparable with those carried on much larger aircraft.' The small drone with big missions Technological advances mean that mission payloads are shrinking in size. What 40 years ago may have required a U-2 Dragon Lady, or 20 years ago may have needed a large UAS to carry them, can today be accommodated by a drone as small as the 9-feet-long V-BAT. 'From a sensor standpoint, there’s a wide variety of electro-optical and infrared sensors that are carried in the nose of the V-BAT,' explains Harris. 'We can carry a couple of different models of Synthetic Aperture Radar [SAR] on the belly of the aircraft and a SIGINT [signals intelligence] payload that can be carried with antennas distributed across the aircraft. We also carry a wide area visual camera search system known as Visual Detection and Ranging, or ViDAR.' You can read more about Shield AI’s ViDAR system here. Shield AI has also developed a sensor payload known as Sentient Tracker, which combines artificial intelligence with Shield AI’s (formerly Sentient Vision Systems) moving target indicator. Its AI-enabled tracking allows operators to automatically detect moving objects within electro-optical (EO) or infrared (IR) full-motion video. 'During a recent demonstration, the Shield AI team performed a search over an area twice the size of Dallas, in about 90 minutes,' explains Harris. That demonstration enabled us to get an image file of every person and every single vehicle in that entire area. Comparing that to a moving target indicator radar image, for example, where you get loads of little dots on a map, with our system you get an actual image.' A V-BAT launches for a maritime mission. Shield AI The camera array on the V-BAT feeds raw data into a processing algorithm that's running onboard. 'The AI software sifts that data and downloads pertinent information to the ground station, along with the coordinates,' says Harris. This means there’s no requirement to transmit five different feeds of 8K video that would blow your bandwidth, you're just sending the things you really need to see. For example, you might see a vehicle driving down a street and with this system you have the resolution to decide if it’s weaponized or not.' 'While the V-BAT carries a smaller camera than some of the bigger platforms, and therefore it can't see as far, V-BAT is a one-million-dollar-class aircraft, so you can afford to procure and operate many more of them. Now you have a swarming team of four V-BATs monitoring that same area, which is a very powerful tool.' The V-BAT’s weapons capabilities elevate it from a versatile uncrewed aircraft system (UAS) to a powerful tactical asset. For example, in May 2023 during the U.S. Army Futures Command’s EDGE exercise, V-BAT successfully delivered a live glide munition known as Hatchet, a miniature precision strike weapon with GPS and laser guidance. This showcased its potential to deliver kinetic payloads with precision and efficiency. Configured with a 'belly bay' for payload delivery, and with a new generation of V-BAT being equipped with wing hardpoints for external payload carriage, the V-BAT offers the flexibility to serve as a long-range, reusable loitering munition capability, further enhancing its battlefield utility. Armor Harris inside the V-BAT production facility. Shield AI Superiority through mass Intelligent teams of drones are being developed to tackle a range of modern-day missions. A team of V-BATs not only offers a versatile range of mission roles, but also adds a level of survivability. 'There are three basic methods that we consider relevant in terms of survivability in a contested environment,' Harris explains. 'The first is to be faster than everybody else, which is what the SR-71 Blackbird did – it could outrun the interceptors. The west has also invested heavily in stealth designs to avoid a platform being targeted by radar, but that has resulted in platforms becoming dramatically more expensive over time. The third way, and part of the rationale behind V-BAT, is to be more numerous than your opponent.' Harris says if you can beat the cost curve, you can operate greater numbers of platforms, and therefore potentially operate in a denied environment just as effectively as the exquisite platforms. 'We’ve seen genuine realization that you can in many instances achieve the mission of a multimillion-dollar-class super exquisite aircraft with a team of much cheaper, more numerous, drones. Sure, some of them might get shot down, but those that survive will be able to complete the mission. There’s also the matter of getting them to where you need to launch them. V-BAT doesn’t require a huge airfield and doesn't need a complex refueling operation to get to where it needs to be.' 'In the Cold War it was all about mass. Then it evolved to be about exquisite capabilities. Now, the technology has evolved again, and we are right back at mass again, and that's really been enabled by autonomy. The fundamental limiters were cost and the number of trained pilots, and not wanting to put those highly trained pilots at risk. Today, with the ability to operate autonomous aircraft, it unlocks mass once again.' V-BATs ready to be shipped. Shield AI V-BAT on the rise Shield AI has delivered about 250 V-BATs to date, which are in service with a range of operators in the U.S. and around the world. In some cases they have replaced legacy unmanned intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) platforms of various sizes, and in others they have been used to establish completely new drone programs for customers. U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) and the U.S. Marine Corps have now been joined by the U.S. Coast Guard as a third domestic V-BAT operator. 'We will start flying with the Coast Guard in 2025,' says Harris. 'Operators are realizing that V-BAT is quite unique. It can do much of what an MQ-4 or MQ-9 can do, but they can launch it anywhere and carry it around on the back of a truck or on a ship.' 'During the recent operations in the Persian Gulf, the U.S. Navy has been launching waves of fighter aircraft, burning a lot of gas, operating fully loaded and waiting for Houthi targets to appear. They’ve been bottlenecked by the ability to find, fix, and engage these fleeting targets quickly, because they’re up against a smart adversary. The Houthis are popping up, launching, and quickly going back into hiding. You actually need a persistent, wide area search capability to pinpoint these kinds of targets fast.' 'We see the targeting mission as being extremely critical. If we can target, we can support a stand-off weapon as a far more effective combination.' V-BAT operations are highly automated, and Harris says it’s as simple as touching on a digital map where you want it to operate. 'We have settled on four aircraft as a V-BAT team, partly because of what we have seen during operations in the Red Sea. The Houthis have been able to down some of the larger drones, so four V-BATs give us some redundancy while being able to cover the same search area as a single larger Group 5 drone.' Shield AI's facility in Texas is the heart of V-BAT production. Shield AI The Batcave Shield AI manufactures V-BATs at its plant in Dallas, Texas, known affectionately as the 'Batcave,' and Harris says the company can easily build one V-BAT per day, and that the facility is capable of supporting a daily production rate of six-to-10, or more. 'We manufacture approximately half of the components in house and the other parts that are supplied to us are mainly machine parts, composites, as well as cast and forged parts. Our new generation of V-BAT that we are launching soon is the first to field a heavy-fuel [JP-5 and Jet-A] engine, where the previous engine ran on gasoline. From a logistics standpoint this will make a huge difference with integration to militaries around the world.' Harris says the new V-BAT iteration also provides fully autonomous launch and landing, which will be entirely without operator intervention. 'The current V-BAT requires a groundcrew to set it up, to stabilize it ready for launch, and to control it for initial take-off and landing. The new version does away with all of that, you can just stand it up on its small launch pad and literally press go.' 'V-BAT has a huge throttle range, which makes the powerplant pretty challenging to get absolutely right, because it’s a big beast to get vertically off the ground, but then once it’s airborne you want maximum endurance, that means burning as little fuel as possible while in the air.' V-BATs on the production line in the 'Batcave.' Shield AI The priority for V-BAT employment is to stay on station for as long as possible, which can be in excess of 12 hours. 'It actually wants to fly very slow, around 50 knots in loiter mode, but it can also dash at a faster speed,' Harris explains. 'It will also generally sit up at around 15,000 feet, which is a big advantage as it’s away from a lot of the ground threats.' 'The new variant is slightly bigger, and its take-off weight has increased from 130 pounds to 155 pounds. So, you can carry more fuel, more payload, and it has longer endurance. Having a lot more computer power onboard is also going to open up all kinds of missions that current V-BATs aren’t undertaking today.' The level of expertise and technological knowhow at Shield AI is a critical enabler of the types of advanced capability that the company is developing. It places huge emphasis on the quality of its engineers, who are working at the bleeding edge of drone and AI technology. 'In the U.S. over the last 20-30 years, too few talented young people in technology and engineering have considered working in defense. With the global situation, even a small percentage of these engineers could make a significant impact.' 'This is technology that drives the outcome of conflicts, making it critical to attract more talent to this space. At Shield AI, the best ideas win, whether they come from an intern or the CEO – it’s the ultimate meritocracy.'

Dressing For Success At 70,000-Feet Aboard The U-2 Dragon Lady	As the U.S. Air Force’s U-2 Dragon Lady spy plane enters the twilight of its career, opportunities to get a glimpse into its critical mission and unique mode of operations are becoming increasingly sought after. In the past, TWZ has reported on civilian photographer Blair Bunting’s flight into the stratosphere in the cockpit of a two-seat TU-2S and the spectacular imagery he brought with him back to Earth. Now, Blair has followed that up with an account of his preparation for that same mission, focusing on the life-support elements that are exclusive to the Dragon Lady. Blair’s latest account, which you can read in full on his website, brings to the forefront how the U-2 mission relies entirely on the pilot’s pressure suit, also referred to as the 'spacesuit' — and the broader life-support equipment — to ensure its success. The pilot of a U-2 Dragon Lady spy plane photographed by Blair Bunting, part of the series 'Photoshoot at the Edge of Space.' Blair Bunting Blair Bunting With a rare chance to ride in the cockpit of the U-2, Blair became well acquainted with the workings of the Physiological Support Division, or PSD, as he went through the long preparations for his flight at Beale Air Force Base, California. Eight months before the TU-2S lifted off with Blair aboard, the photographer was at Beale, getting familiarized with the base, the squadrons, and especially the spacesuit. 'On the third day of my initial trip [to Beale], I was required to don the suit and sit for over an hour working through how to drink and eat, and what to do when I needed to go to the bathroom,' Blair recalls. 'I put on a brave face, but the truth is, I was scared shitless.' As for the spacesuit — or full-pressure suit in Air Force parlance — this piece of kit really is remarkably similar in concept and design to those worn by astronauts. It is made of three layers of Nomex material and weighs 90 pounds. The suits are provided in around 12 different sizes, based on pilot body size, and are further customized with adjustable panels in the torso, arms, and legs. Each Air Force U-2 pilot has two suits, and each one costs about $125,000. A U-2 pilot photographed by Blair Bunting. Blair Bunting Blair Bunting Flying in excess of 60,000 feet above the Earth, a loss of cabin pressure could be fatal for U-2 pilots, meaning ‘the suit is life’ and its upkeep is the responsibility of the physiological support division at Beale. 'If the cabin pressure fails, a controller on the suit will inflate it to an atmosphere of about 35,000 feet,' Sergeant Hawley, a launch and recovery supervisor for the 99th Reconnaissance Squadron explained in a previous Air Force media release. 'If that fails, a second system will inflate it to about 37,000 feet. As a last resort, the helmet will create an atmosphere of about 39,000 feet. That’s a high altitude, but it’s better than 63,000 feet where they can’t survive.' A two-seat TU-2S Dragon Lady of the kind that Blair Bunting flew in. U.S. Air Force One of the Air Force's two-seat TU-2S trainers. USAF After all, at 63,000 feet, human blood will boil since there’s not enough pressure to sustain oxygen in the bloodstream. Nitrogen flows out of the solution, leading to decompression sickness, or ‘the bends.’ As well as the spacesuit, U-2 pilots also breathe 100 percent oxygen for one hour before the flight to try and rid the blood of most of its nitrogen, mitigating the risk of the bends. 'It was not on the flight, but rather the day before, as I was sitting in a pressure chamber testing my spacesuit one last time, that I realized how absolute my reliance on it would be,' Blair reflects. 'I was well aware of the extreme risk to anyone who had the misfortune of being ejected from a U-2. Yet, I took solace in knowing that because of this multi-layered suit, there would at least be a chance — although small — of survival should that situation become a reality. One of the images that came from Blair’s flight in a TU-2S, Other more mundane thoughts were running through Blair’s mind at this point, such as what to do if his nose began to itch at altitude, with no way to get within the pressurized 'glass fishbowl' encasing his head. Breathing exercises and mental meditations became an important part of his preparation to deal with these kinds of psychological stresses. Meanwhile, Beale’s Physiological Support Division was responsible for preparing the suit as well as the food and drinks and would also be driving Blair to the plane and strapping him into it, connecting his suit to the generators, and making sure the seal around his face was tight. In fact, so impressed was Blair with the PSD team that he returned to Beale six months after completing his photo-shoot flight. This next assignment was all about recording the work of the men and women in the background of the U-2 enterprise, but without whom its mission would be impossible. Blair trying out his fitted pressure suit prior to the actual mission. Blair Bunting For this next photo-shoot, Blair chose to document four of the key interactions that he had had with the PSD team in the run-up to the flight: pressure checks for the suit in the chamber, suit integration, the ride to the flight line, and stepping to the plane. It’s in the chamber that the U-2 pilot starts to breathe the 100 percent oxygen and it’s an impressive space by any measure. In a black-painted room the size of a house, concealed behind a foot-thick door, is a chair for the pilot. While being fed the oxygen from a yellow bottle, they are attended to by two members of the PSD team, wearing masks and helmets. The activity is observed from a control room, behind a thick pane of glass. In a stark reminder of the dangers of depressurization, a water bottle next to the pilot’s chair shows them how bubbles would course through their bloodstream, were the worst to happen. As for the suit integration part, Blair was limited here as to what he could photograph, due to operational security, but this portion of the preparation involves donning space underwear, of the crotchless type, to accommodate a catheter (or Urinary Collection Device). Next, actually getting into the spacesuit is a process that requires 20 people (plus a media team and assorted spectators from the base). Entering the suit is a case of ‘diving’ into it, 'folding forward and pushing my head into the main O-ring,' says Blair. 'While not visible from the outside, the feet are actually part of the suit and are then covered up by a secondary external boot.' A U-2 pilot is integrated into his spacesuit. Blair Bunting Blair Bunting 'Once you are zipped up (from the crotch to the bottom of the neck), you are walked to a chair that looks like a motorized La-Z-Boy on a platform. Along the wall are gauges, tubes, and headphones. On the armrests lay thin white gloves that will serve as a barrier between your hands and the suit itself. One of the members asks if you want your air conditioning tube on the top or bottom of your wrist.' Next, the helmet is put it on and locked to the suit’s O-ring to the suit, then the gloves are slid on and attached to the suit, and the visor is closed. 'Things move quickly. The chair is promptly reclined, and five or six squadron members dive in, pulling and tugging on straps, running through checklists, taking oxygen measurements, and adjusting the suit,' Blair adds. 'The realization hits you that the operating room you just entered is your own, and these people are here to keep you alive. It is as equally terrifying as it is inspiring.' A U-2 pilot during the ride to the flight line. Blair Bunting Blair Bunting The next image shows the ride to the flight line, in a truck nicknamed the ‘bread van.’ The pilot at this point is still hooked up to the oxygen tank and the van has two more La-Z-Boy-style chairs for the pilot (or pilots, for a TU-2S mission). A U-2 pilot in the ‘bread van.’ Blair Bunting Blair Bunting Finally, Blair documented the walk to the aircraft itself. At this point, the truck drops the pilot off outside a hangar, in which ground crew are already busily getting the Dragon Lady ready for flight. Understandably, Blair’s return to Beale six months after his own flight triggered his own memories of the mission and his own ‘stepping to the jet’ for an unforgettable journey to the edge of space. Earth from (near-)space. As recorded during Blair’s U-2 flight. Blair Bunting Blair Bunting As for Blair’s incredible flight, you can read more about that in his own account. By any measure, a flight in a U-2 is a vanishingly rare occurrence for a civilian. Now, as the U-2 enters the end of its long service, such opportunities are only becoming rarer. With that in mind, it’s all the more fitting that Blair has paid homage to the iconic spy plane in such a remarkable way.

Extended Range AIM-120s, AIM-9s Eyed To Meet Future Air-to-Air Mi...	The U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy could soon be tasked with exploring whether extending the range of existing AIM-120 and AIM-9 air-to-air missiles is one path to help right-size stocks of those weapons. Congress is pushing for a broader assessment of U.S. air-to-air missile inventories amid growing concerns that obligations in the Middle East and Ukraine are eating into key munition stocks that would be especially crucial for any future high-end fight with China. An entire section dedicated to 'Assessments of Inventory Requirements for Air-to-Air Missiles' is included in the latest iteration of the annual U.S. defense policy bill, or National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), for the 2025 Fiscal Year. The text of the bill, which represents a compromise between previous House and Senate drafts, was released this past weekend. Navy sailors handle AIM-9X Sidewinders aboard a carrier. USN If passed and signed into law, the new NDAA would require the offices of the Secretaries of the Air Force and the Navy to 'develop recommendations to adjust the planned mix of missiles, including an assessment of whether extending the range or capability of existing air-to-air missiles would better support combined combatant command requirements at medium risk' no later than April 1, 2025. The air-to-air missile section would also prompt the Air Force and Navy Secretaries to do the following: 'Assess planned deliveries of air-to-air missiles through 2029 and the total available missiles by type in each year through 2029.' 'Assess combined requirements for air-to-air missiles to support operational plans of the United States Central Command, the United States Indo-Pacific Command, the United States Northern Command, and the United States European Command, at low, medium, and high risk.' 'Consider emerging requirements for surface-to-air defense and collaborative combat aircraft and how those additional missions will affect inventory requirements for air-to-air missiles.' 'Consider the sufficiency of planned acquisition for air-to-air missiles through 2029 to meet operational requirements.' 'Consider whether continuing production of the advanced medium-range air-to-air missile [AMRAAM] program of record through 2029 would enhance available inventories of air-to-air missiles.' The Air Force and Navy currently have two main air-to-air missile types in their inventories, the AIM-120 AMRAAM and the shorter-range AIM-9 Sidewinder. The two services are working together on a new longer-range air-to-air missile, the AIM-260 Joint Advanced Tactical Missile (JATM), details about which remain limited. The Navy has also fielded, at least on a limited level, an air-launched version of the multipurpose Standard Missile-6 (SM-6) called the AIM-174B, which you can read more about here. The Air Force has also been exploring other new air-to-air missile concepts, including compact and modular designs, in recent years. The possibility of further extending the range of the AIM-9 and AIM-120 is particularly notable given that U.S. officials have publicly presented AIM-260 as being intended to meet the demand for increased reach in aerial combat. The Air Force has also said that the emergence of China's PL-15 air-to-air missile was a key factor in prompting the development of the JATM, which is expected to have the same general form factor as the AMRAAM. China, as well as Russia, have been developing and fielding other even longer-range air-to-air missiles, along with airborne early warning aircraft and other capabilities that could help maximize the effectiveness of those weapons. Increasing the range of existing missiles could be another valuable option. The stated goal had been to start fielding the AIM-260 JATM by 2022, but there are no indications publicly that this has occurred despite very active testing of the missile. Whether this reflects issues with JATM's development to date is unknown. In the meantime, the latest subvariants of the current generation AIM-120D already have significantly greater reach than earlier AMRAAMs and there has been talk in the past of extending the range of the AIM-9X Sidewinder. Improved rocket motors with highly loaded propellants have been cited previously as a possible relatively low-effort way to increase the capability of existing missiles. The War Zone has explored in detail how a short-to-medium range variant or derivative of the AIM-9X, specifically, could offer a substantial boost in capability. A US Navy F/A-18E Super Hornet with a full load of AIM-120 and AIM-9X missiles. USN Building off existing designs would offer the additional benefit of being able to leverage present production pipelines and supply chains. Depending on what changes are required, older missiles could conceivably be upgraded to newer extended-range standards, as well. At the same time, the other portions in the air-to-air missile section of the latest version of the Fiscal Year 2025 NDAA underscores broader concerns about present inventories and the ability to not only replenish them, but expand their size, in the coming years. As one of the other provisions highlights, the Air Force and Navy are, at least publicly, looking to stop buying AIM-120s entirely by the Fiscal Year 2028-2029 timeframe, which might align with current plans for the AIM-260. 'Up to this year, where most of the employment of weapons were really artillery pieces and short-range weapons, I had said not at all,' U.S. Navy Adm. Samuel Paparo, head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM), said in November when asked about whether U.S. military aid to Ukraine and ongoing fighting in and around the Middle East was having a negative impact on U.S. military readiness in his part of the world. Paparo's remarks came at an open event at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, D.C. 'Now, with some of the Patriots that have been employed, some of the air-to-air missiles that have been employed, it is now eating into [our] stocks. … and to say otherwise would be dishonest,' he continued. When it comes to air-to-air missiles, AIM-120s and AIM-9Xs have been expended in the course of operations to protect friendly warships and commercial vessels from attacks by Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen and in the defense of Israel. Ukraine has been making significant use of National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems the U.S. military has helped provide, especially in combination with the AIM-120. NASAMS can also fire AIM-9Xs. A US Air Force F-15E Strike Eagle carrying AIM-120 and AIM-9X missiles flies somewhere in the Middle East. USAF This latter point highlights the additional provision in the latest version of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2025 that calls for looking at how 'emerging requirements for surface-to-air defense' will have an impact on all this. The U.S. military operates a small number of NASAMS to help defend the airspace around Washington, D.C. The U.S. Army is also in the process of fielding a new short-range air defense system called Enduring Shield, the primary interceptor for which will be the AIM-9X, at least initially. That, in turn, will create additional immediate demand for more Sidewinders. There are similar questions about what increased fielding of the AIM-174B might mean for the SM-6 pipeline, which is already under strain. A rendering of Enduring Shield launchers firing AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles. Dynetics As the latest version of the 2025 Fiscal Year NDAA highlights, questions about the mix of platforms that will be armed with air-to-air missiles in the future, including Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) type drones that the Air Force and Navy are pursuing, are another factor in these deliberations. Plans to deploy large numbers of CCAs, which the Air Force already envisions arming with AIM-120s and AIM-260s, together with crewed platforms would increase the total number of air-to-air missiles required for any single mission. The Air Force's plans for a new sixth-generation stealth crewed combat jet as part of its Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative) are now extremely uncertain, while the Navy says it is pressing ahead in the development of a similar aircraft referred to as the F/A-XX. The Air Force has also laid out much larger concerns about the affordability of a host of top-tier air combat modernization efforts. There has even been talk about the possibility of expanding the aerial combat role of the forthcoming B-21 Raider stealth bomber to help meet future requirements. However the Air Force and Navy might choose to proceed, calls to not only sustain, but increase air-to-air missile inventories are only likely to grow in the coming years, especially in the context of preparing for a potential high-end fight with China in the Pacific. Missiles like the AIM-120 and AIM-9X contain high-end and often unique components that can take months or even years to procure, which puts additional emphasis on making decision about new developments as soon as possible. 'We should replenish those [munition] stocks and then some. I was already dissatisfied with the magazine depth,' Adm. Paparo said bluntly at the Brookings event back in November. 'I’m a little more dissatisfied with the magazine depth. You know, it’s a time for straight talk.' Congress looks increasingly poised to demand the Air Force and Navy look into whether extended-range AIM-120s and AIM-9X, as well as other avenues, could help address future air-to-air missile needs.

New Syrian Prime Minister Assumes Power Amid Airstrikes, Continue...	Syrian rebels selected a new caretaker prime minister on Tuesday as the nation remains roiled by conflict after the overthrow of dictator Bashar al-Assad. Mohammed al-Bashir assumes office on an interim basis amid ongoing fighting in parts of the country and as Israel and the U.S. take advantage of the post-Assad power vacuum in the form of mass airstrikes. Bashir is a provincial leader aligned with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the former al-Qaidi-linked group that led the lightning 11-day offensive that toppled Assad. He will serve until March 1, 2025, Al Jazeera reported. His appointment was announced after meeting with members of the old Assad government. 'Today we had a meeting for the cabinet and we invited members from the old government and some directors from the administration in Idlib and its surrounding areas, in order to facilitate all the necessary works for the next two months until we have a constitutional system to be able to serve the Syrian people,' he told Al Jazeera.

Zelin (@azelin) December 10, 2024 Bashir headed the Syrian Salvation Government (SSG) in Idlib province before the rebel offensive and has close ties to HTS. A Facebook page of the rebel administration says 'al-Bashir was trained as an electrical engineer, later received a degree in sharia and law, and has also held posts in education,' Al Jazeera explained. HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Julani met outgoing Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi al-Jalali on Monday to discuss the transition to a caretaker government. However, the peace Syria will need to establish a cohesive, inclusive government seems elusive. Israel on Tuesday said it had largely completed its campaign of air and naval strikes on Syria’s air defenses, missiles and ships it dubbed internally 'Bashan Arrow.' However, Jerusalem has created what Defense Minister Israel Katz said on Tuesday was a 'sterile buffer zone' with ground troops in Syria. He later said it would be a temporary presence, though he offered no end date to the operation.

It is a roughly 400-square-kilometer (155-square-mile) section of the Golan Heights that was established after the 1973 Mideast war. The push marks Israel’s first overt entry into Syrian territory since then. New reports emerged on Tuesday claiming that Israeli forces in Syria 'have reached about 25 kilometers (16 miles) southwest of Damascus,' The Jerusalem Post reported on Tuesday, citing two regional security sources and one Syrian security source. 'The Syrian security source said Israeli troops reached Qatana, which is 10 kilometers into Syrian territory east of a demilitarized zone (DMZ) separating Israeli-occupied Golan Heights from Syria,' the publication reported. Israeli officials denied those claims, saying that they are 'completely incorrect. IDF forces are present inside the buffer zone and at defensive points close to the border in order to protect the Israeli border.' Like Katz, the IDF spokesmen offered no timeline for when Israel will withdraw its ground forces from Syria. The reports circulating in the media about the alleged advancement of Israeli tanks towards Damascus are false.

Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia have condemned Israel’s incursion, accusing it of exploiting the disarray in Syria and violating international law, The Associated Press reported. Turkey, a major backer of anti-Assad forces, also condemned Israel’s advance. The Turkish Foreign Ministry accused Israel of 'displaying a mentality of an occupier' at a time when the possibility of peace and stability had emerged in Syria. On Monday, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Israel’s incursion constitutes a violation of the 1974 disengagement agreement and called on both Israel and Syria to uphold it. Meanwhile, Israel released new details and video on Tuesday of its air and naval offensive against the remnants of Assad’s military. 'Within the last 48 hours, the IDF struck most of the strategic weapons stockpiles in Syria, preventing them from falling into the hands of terrorist elements,' the IDF said on Telegram. IAF and the Israeli Navy carried out 'over 350 strikes during the operation,' Times of Israel military reporter Emanuel Fabian stated on Twitter. The military estimates that it destroyed '70-80% of the former Assad regime's strategic weapons,' he reported. 'The waves of airstrikes carried out by IAF fighter jets and drones hit Syrian air defense systems, airbases, weapon depots, and weapon production sites in Damascus, Homs, Tartus, Latakia, and Palmyra,' he explained, 'The IDF says the airstrikes destroyed many long-range projectiles, Scud missiles, cruise missiles, coast-to-sea missiles, air defense missiles, fighter jets, helicopters, radars, tanks, hangars, and more. The Israeli Navy's strikes at the Minet el-Beida bay and Latakia port on the Syrian coast destroyed 15 Syrian naval vessels.' You can read more about the Navy's assault in our story here.

'Turkish proxies, with support from Turkish airstrikes, advanced today toward the town of Kobani,' AL Monitor reported. 'They began their push after seizing control of Karakozak, a bridge that connects the western and eastern banks of the Euphrates River, despite fierce resistance from Kurdish forces.' The attacks come as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan renewed vows to crush 'terrorist organizations such as ISIS and the [Kurdish Workers Party] PKK/PYD in other parts of the country as soon as possible,' AL Monitor explained.

How long that ceasefire holds remains to be seen. Fighting rages on between Turks and Kurds in the northern Syrian town of Kobani. (Google Earth image) In addition to the fights up north, ISIS continues to present a deadly threat. The terror group's cells 'executed 54 members of regime forces near Kaziya in Al-Sukhna area in Homs Desert,' SOHR reported. The ISIS cells also arrested members who fled from the military service in the desert and Deir Ezzor after the regime of Al-Assad fell, according to SOHR. As we previously reported, over the weekend, the U.S. launched a massive series of airstrikes against ISIS, hitting over 75 targets using multiple U.S. Air Force assets, including B-52s, F-15s, and A-10s, according to U.S. Central Command. Deeply disturbing: 'Islamic State forces on Tuesday killed 54 people in the Homs region in central Syria who had been part of the Syrian government’s military and fled during the collapse of the Assad regime,' says the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights. Kenneth Roth (@KenRoth) December 10, 2024 Claims are now emerging about how Assad fled the country with a fortune. We recently told you about Assad's massive bunker and huge car collection, riches he amassed while his people starved. Now that he is supposedly in Russia, claims have emerged that Assad transferred $135 billion in assets during his escape, the Turkish Turkiye Gazetesi news outlet reported on Tuesday. 'The Assad family transferred the nation’s resources into their own pockets during the years of civil war,' former intelligence officer Khalid Beyye told the publication. 'As the regime collapsed, they took a large portion of the country’s economy with them.' The former Syrian dictator's flight to Moscow spurred the mocking ire of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whose country is defending a nearly three-year-old full-on invasion by Russia that contributed to Assad's demise. 'The 'brave' Assad ran away to Putin,' Zelensky chided on Twitter. 'Where will Putin run away?&#8230;Assad and Putin are more than just vassal and lord. They are accomplices in violence.

Tice, a Marine veteran and freelance journalist, disappeared on Aug. 14, 2012, while he was reporting on the Syrian civil war. Weeks later, a short video appeared online that showed a distressed Tice blindfolded with his apparent captors. It was the last time he was seen. President Joe Biden expressed optimism that Tice could be returned to the U.S. in the wake of Assad's fall. 'We think we can get him back, but we have no direct evidence of that yet,' Biden said at the White House Sunday. 'We have to identify where he is.' Biden previously said the U.S. knows 'with certainty that he has been held by the Syrian regime.' On Tuesday, White House National Security Advisor John Kirby cautioned that the U.S. 'has no additional information on Austin Tice.' 'This development could present an opportunity for us to glean more information about him, his whereabouts, his condition, but as you and I are speaking here this morning, I can't report that we have any additional context,' Kirby told reporters, including from The War Zone, at a press briefing.

Su-57 Felon’s Two-Dimensional Thrust-Vectoring Engine Nozzle Brea...	Imagery has appeared showing Russia’s Sukhoi Su-57 Felon advanced fighter fitted with a new type of thrust-vectoring engine nozzle. The radical-looking exhaust design is intended to improve the low-observable features of the Felon, although the future of the new nozzle is far from certain. The videos and photos show the rear aspect of the second flying prototype for the Su-57 program, T-50-2, which was first flown in March 2011. It was subsequently used to test the improved AL-51F-1 (also known as izdeliye 30) turbofan, which was first flown in December 2017 — with just one of the engines installed in the aircraft, alongside one of the original AL-41F-1s. Video soon according to secretprojects forum user QuadroFX pic.twitter.com/MTIs0FjAaK&mdash; Fighterman_FFRC (@Fighterman_FFRC) December 10, 2024 What’s notable about the turbofan seen fitted in the left engine nacelle of the T-50-2 is its nozzle, which is an example of the new flattened version that is intended to equip the AL-51F1 once it’s installed in the improved Su-57M version of the fighter. So far, no orders have been placed for this variant of the aircraft. Another view of the flat version of the nozzle for the AL-51F1 (in the left engine nacelle), alongside the original three-dimensional version (right nacelle). via X The AL-51F-1 was developed as a ‘clean-sheet’ design, intended to offer increased thrust, lighter weight, and lower operating costs compared with the previous AL-41F-1. Another drawback of the earlier engine is its inability to provide the Su-57 with supercruise performance — flying over Mach 1.0 for sustained periods without using afterburners. At this point, it’s worth looking at the AL-41F-1, the original engine for the baseline Su-57, and its nozzle configuration. This turbofan is also used, in a simplified form, in the Su-35 Flanker multirole fighter. The AL-41F-1 (also known as izdeliye 117) was produced by modernizing the existing AL-31F engine used in the earlier Su-27 and Su-30 Flanker series fighters.

This is also known as three-dimensional thrust vectoring and provides pitch, yaw, and roll control. In its initial form, the AL-51F-1 also retains a similar three-dimensional thrust vectoring nozzle, but what we see in the new imagery is an alternative nozzle, this time of the two-dimensional type, which provide pitch control as well as limited roll control if engaged asymmetrically. It isn't clear if the angled installation of the nozzle is meant to provide extra control in the latter. The original three-dimensional thrust-vectoring nozzle for the Su-57, seen top, compared with the new nozzle of the two-dimensional type, seen below. via X This kind of stealthy ‘flat’ engine nozzle is also used on the F-22 Raptor, for example, and is primarily chosen to reduce radar signature compared with an axisymmetric nozzle design. It also provides infrared signature advantages, as well. A close-up view of F-22's distinctive thrust vectoring exhaust nozzles in action. Their unique 'hemispherical design' enhances F-22's stealth, even from the rear. In fact, it's said that not even the F-35 can match the F-22's rearward stealth capabilities. pic.twitter.com/9NHC8DECZQ&mdash; Air Power (@RealAirPower1) September 16, 2024 According to Yevgeny Marchukov, CEO of the Arkhip Lyulka Design Bureau responsible for the AL-51F-1, in comments reported by Aviation Week, Sukhoi was not interested in using a flat nozzle for the Su-57 when that program was launched. Only later was the two-dimensional nozzle ordered, after the Su-57 and the AL-51F-1 were flying. Since Sukhoi 'resists changes to the airframe itself,' Marchukov explained, 'That’s why we came up with a rather complex flat nozzle.' As seen in the diagram below, the nozzle has four independently controlled flaps, which work by modifying the air outlet cross-section and thrust vector. Of these flaps, which are installed at an angle, two are reportedly tailored for use in the subsonic regime and two for supersonic flight. The images also appear to show the vectoring flaps being vented, which, when combined with air forced through these areas, would help cool the exhaust and lower the aircraft's infrared signature. Two diagrams of the new nozzle from a company brochure. via X Speaking in the summer of 2023, Marchukov confirmed that the new nozzle had been successfully run on a ground testbed, including with afterburning. He added that a first flight was expected before the end of 2023, although there’s no record of whether that ever happened. For the Su-57, the flat nozzle would bring notable advantages in terms of improving its low observability from the rear aspect. The original design of the Felon optimized low observability from the frontal aspect, with less attention paid to the side and rear aspects. At the same time, the revised nozzles will reduce thrust output to some degree, but this is clearly considered a worthwhile penalty based on the improved low-observable aspects it brings, which are badly needed for the type. It’s also worth noting that another flat nozzle design has been developed for the version of the AL-41F-1 engine used in the Sukhoi S-70 Okhotnik heavy subsonic uncrewed combat air vehicle. In this case, the two-dimensional nozzle is intended to reduce the infrared and radar signatures, but it’s far simpler, without any vectoring controls. via X The Okhotnik was first flown with an interim engine, with a standard round nozzle, but the revised nozzle was fitted to the second aircraft, which was rolled out in December 2021, as you can read about here. As for the flat nozzle version of the AL-51F-1, its future rests very heavily on that of the proposed Su-57M. Work on this enhanced version of the Felon was already well underway when the Su-57 entered production and service, although, with only 76 examples of the original model under contract, it’s far from certain that it will progress further, at least in the near term. Also known as the T-50M, formal work on the ‘deeply modernized’ Su-57M began when Sukhoi received a contract from the Russian Ministry of Defense in October 2018. At one point there were reports of a T-50M prototype beginning flight tests in mid-2022, and series production by the end of 2024. Obviously, these targets have been missed, but if Russia — or an export client — does order more Felons, then this could help kickstart the Su-57M as well. At that point, we might get to see a production version of the two-dimensional thrust-vectoring version of the AL-51F-1 engine, as well.

Tilting Mark 41 Launcher Emerges During Guam’s First Aegis Ashore...	The U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA) conducted its first live intercept of a ballistic missile from the West Pacific island of Guam on Tuesday. The successful test also highlighted new details about the launchers used with the new Aegis Guam System, initial information about which The War Zone was first to report on. The test launch, dubbed Flight Experiment Mission-02 (FEM-02), is considered a key step toward providing 360-degree protection for the strategic outpost, which is on its way to becoming the most densely protected piece of land on the planet. It saw the Aegis Guam System fire a Standard Missile-3 Block IIA (SM-3 Block IIA) to intercept a mock air-launched medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM ). The target MRBM was successfully hit more than 200 nautical miles to the northeast of the island, according to the MDA and the U.S. military’s Joint Task Force-Micronesia. The U.S. Missile Defense Agency's successful intercept of a ballistic missile off Guam. (U.S. Missile Defense Agency) The Aegis Guam System fired the SM-3 Block IIA from a launcher based on the Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS). A picture released by the agency and Lockheed Martin, seen below, reveals that the launcher can actually tilt at least in one direction and can sit vertical for loading weapons and servicing. This is unlike the fixed launcher towers used in existing Aegis Ashore systems. We have reached out to Lockheed Martin, the defense contractor behind the launcher, for more information about this launch system and what benefits it offers. Tilting the launchers to the west, where threats would primarily emanate from, could potentially add a bit more range to some weapons. And every mile would count when it comes to defending the island from a multi-layered missile attack. (U.S. Missile Defense Agency) Missile Defense Agency (U.S. Missile Defense Agency) The test also marked the first end-to-end engagement utilizing the AN/TPY-6 radar during a live ballistic missile defense test, according to the agency, and is the first demonstration we’ve seen of the growing, layered and integrated air and missile defense web that will blanket the island. AN/TPY-6 is based on the same technology as the AN/TPY-7 Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR), according to manufacturer Lockheed Martin. The LRDR is currently used in Alaska, and was also planned for Hawaii, but funding has since dried up for the Hawaii effort, Inside Defense reported in 2023. Guam, about three times the size of Washington, D.C., hosts U.S. Navy combat vessels and rotational deployments of combat aircraft, along with many other capabilities, including military communications and surveillance systems. It is a central cog in the Pentagon’s strategic deterrence efforts in the Indo-Pacific region. During a crisis, the island’s port and airfields would be flooded with U.S. and allied troops and platforms. Few American missions in the region are arguably more critical than protecting Guam. As such, Beijing would place Guam and its U.S. Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps forces in the crosshairs should a full-scale conflict erupt. China’s growing arsenal of ballistic missiles pose the greatest threat to the strategic island outpost. (U.S. Missile Defense Agency) 'The future is focused on defending Guam and protecting forces from any potential regional missile threats,' the MDA said in a statement. Tuesday’s test was part of an ongoing buildup of the so-called Guam Defense System (GDS), which is also referred to in online military records as the Enhanced Integrated Air and Missile Defense (EIAMD) system. It will lean on as many as 20 new air defense sites bristling with surface-to-air interceptors, radars and other assets to counter an attack if war with China breaks out. The MDA test also showcased the joint, interlocking nature of Guam’s defense, and how that task would likely involve not only the U.S. military services, but regional allies as well. While the surrogate threat missile was tracked from Aegis Ashore, the Navy destroyer USS Milius (DDG-69) also detected, tracked and simulated engaging the ballistic missile, providing another layer of sea-based missile defense, according to Joint Task Force-Micronesia. Meanwhile, a U.S. Army Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) unit based on Guam also tracked the missile, while the Japanese destroyer JS Haguro (DDG-180) 'exercised its air defense support' as well. (U.S. Army) www.twz.com TWZ first reported on the plans for drastically beefing up Guam’s defense in August 2023, as military authorities worked to inform local residents of the effort and how it would impact their lives. The Aegis Ashore system that was used in Tuesday’s test is at the core of the Guam defense plan, but it looks very different from other U.S. Aegis Ashore sites in Romania and Poland, the latter of which was declared mission-ready in July 2024. Romania’s system has been in operation since 2016. While the final configuration of Aegis Ashore on Guam remains to be seen, the MDA has noted that it will be distributed to a far greater extent than its predecessors, and could involve certain components being placed in hardened underground facilities or road-mobile ground platforms, TWZ reported. Guam’s Aegis system differs in other ways as well, according to an October 2024 TWZ report that highlighted initial glimpses of the Mk 41 VLS there: 'Aegis Ashore is primarily designed to engage ballistic threats during the midcourse portion of their flight outside the Earth’s atmosphere using SM-3 interceptors. However, the Mk 41 is a modular launcher, meaning that additional anti-missile interceptors, such as the terminal-stage intercept and anti-air SM-6 and the forthcoming Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI), which could also be added. With its ability to take down certain incoming hypersonic threats, as well as other weapons, the GPI could be especially relevant for the defense of Guam. With additional launchers, even dispersed around the island, shorter-ranged missiles, such as the Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) Block II and even the latest SM-2s, could feasibly provide protection against air breathing threats, such as cruise missiles and drones. Patriot interceptors are now also now a possibility.' A map published by the MDA in October 2024 reveals 16 proposed sites across the island for air defense system assets, including Ritidian Point at Guam’s northern end, Naval Base Guam’s (NBG) Barrigada site in the middle of the island and a location within the Naval Munitions Site (NMS) to the south. (U.S. Missile Defense Agency) Another map shows nine radar arcs, including a comparatively larger arc projecting from Ritidian Point, which is now under the jurisdiction of the Marine Corps’ new Camp Blaz. (U.S. Missile Defense Agency) Other air systems that could engage various types of ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as fixed-wing aircraft and drones, during an attack include Patriot surface-to-air missiles, and lower-tier anti-air missile systems to include medium-range and short range (SHORAD) systems, as well as possibly directed energy weapons in the future. Go here to read more about the lower-tier capabilities that will protect Guam. Precisely when all the planned GDS pieces will be installed and ready to operate remains unclear, but officials have said they want at least some of the components operational by 2026. While much remains to be seen, Tuesday’s takedown of a ballistic missile threat underscored one way that the Pentagon plans to lock down Guam’s airspace in the event of crisis, and how it will need a panoply of systems to accomplish this vital task.

Russia Giving North Korea MiG-29s And Su-27s Isn’t That Straightf...	North Korea is set to receive MiG-29 Fulcrum and Su-27 Flanker fighter aircraft from Russia in return for Pyongyang having sent thousands of troops to fight in Moscow’s war in Ukraine. This is the assessment of the commander of the United States Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM), after much speculation about the nature of the support that might be headed to North Korea to reward that country for its growing military backing of Russia. The prospect of fighter aircraft being transferred by Russia is something that TWZ has discussed in the past but there are questions to be asked about how simple it will be to provide Pyongyang with serviceable MiG-29s and Su-27s — especially at short notice. Adm. Samuel Paparo, the USINDOPACOM commander, recently told reporters that Moscow and Pyongyang had reached an agreement on the fighter transfer. Speaking at the Reagan National Defense Forum in Simi Valley, California, Paparo notes that the aircraft involved were older, fourth-generation types, but were still 'formidable.' U.S. Navy Adm. Samuel Paparo, left, commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, gives two thumbs up after a successful strike during a joint exercise. U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Kurtis A. Hatcher Petty Officer 1st Class Kurtis A Hatcher Paparo also provided some other details about the deployment of North Korean soldiers to assist Russia in its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, as well as the counteroffensive directed against Ukrainian troops in the Kursk region. The admiral said that North Korea had provided the troops without prompting and that, although they have been deployed to combat zones, they haven’t yet seen active combat. This is contrary to other statements, including from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has said that North Korean soldiers are in engaged in combat on the front line. Regardless, providing troops — as well as significant quantities of arms, including huge numbers of artillery shells, and all the way up to short-range ballistic missiles — clearly seems to have paid off for Pyongyang. As we have discussed in the past, a Russian offer to revamp the aging Korean People’s Air Force (KPAF) would almost certainly be snapped up by North Korea. The most capable aircraft in the KPAF inventory are MiG-29 fighters and Su-25 Frogfoot ground-attack aircraft, followed by older MiG-23 Flogger swing-wing combat jets. Otherwise, its combat fleet comprises even more antiquated equipment, including Chinese-made H-5 Beagle first-generation jet bombers, Soviet-era MiG-21 Fishbeds and their Chinese F-7 equivalents, and Chinese-made F-6 Farmers — a first-generation supersonic fighter. Even F-5 Fresco jets —a license-built version of the MiG-17, which was first flown in 1950 — remain in KPAF service, although these are reportedly only now considered for suicide missions. Back in September 2023, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited the Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association (KnAAPO), based in Komsomolsk-on-Amur in the Russian Far East. This plant builds advanced fighters including the Su-57 Felon next-generation fighter and the Su-35 Flanker multirole fighter, the two highest-end single-seat fighters in Russian service today. Kim’s visit to KnAAPO led to speculation that advanced fighters might be headed to North Korea, which at that point was preparing to provide Russia with artillery shells and other materiel. At the time of the visit, Mikhail Degtyarev, regional governor of Khabarovsk Krai, where the KnAAPO facility is located, took to Telegram to provide details and the following statement: 'Our fathers and grandfathers fought together against Japanese militarism, our country supported North Korea in its fight against the United States’ imperialist ambitions in the 1950s, and today we jointly stand up to the pressure of the collective West.' Meanwhile, in our reporting of the visit, TWZ wrote: 'Clearly, the Su-35 and Su-57 jets produced by KnAAPO would represent a huge upgrade over the severely outdated equipment that North Korea’s air arm currently flies … [But] even if top-of-the-line Su-35s and Su-57s are not on the table, other less capable aircraft would still be a massive upgrade for Pyongyang compared to its existing fleet of older Russian-made jets … Almost anything available from Russia would be sought after, whether MiG-29SMTs, Su-27s, or Su-30s. Even a supply of spare parts and overhauls of its current types would be of great value to Pyongyang.' North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visits the KnAAPO aircraft factory, accompanied by Russian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry and Trade, Denis Manturov (third from right), on September 15, 2023. Photo by Gov of Khabarovsk Reg/M. Degtyaryov/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images Based on Paparo’s statements, it seems that only the MiG-29 and Su-27 are currently being lined up for transfer to North Korea, a decision that raises some important questions. After all, the presence in Russian military service of both the MiG-29 and Su-27 is now dwindling and these types are by now long out of production. Aside from a handful used for test duties and with display teams, Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) first-generation MiG-29s are now found only within one training regiment, and a frontline regiment based in Armenia. One less likely, but possible source of MiG-29s could be the aircraft that were refurbished for use by Wagner in support of the Khalifa Haftar’s forces in the Libyan civil war. These unmarked jets appeared at Russia’s Khmeimim Air Base in Syria, where we got a better look at them, before being deployed to Libya. The current status of these jets is very much unclear. An unmarked MiG-29 at Khmeimim Air Base in Syria. via @200_zoka The status of the more modern MiG-29SMT — a type that Russia inherited from a botched Algerian order — is a bit more complex. While these aircraft — which are multirole-capable — went into service at Kursk-Khalino, they have since been stored for a longer period. They would require some degree of overhaul to make them active again, were they to be transferred to North Korea. One of the former Algerian MiG-29SMT fighters seen in Russian service in 2013.

The 14th Guards Regiment used them between 2010 and 2019 at Kursk airfield, and replaced them with Su-30SMs, so the original Russian SMTs flew for just under ten years!!! pic.twitter.com/BXKiNikX3o&mdash; Eastern Order of Battle (@EasternOrbat) December 7, 2024 Russia's most advanced MiG-29s, the naval MiG-29KRs that are assigned to the country's only aircraft carrier's air wing, are an option, but also a questionable one. Handing those jets over to North Korea would mean the Admiral Kuznetsov carrier would only have aged Su-33s for its fixed wing contingent. Although the ship has not been to sea for many years and its refurbishment has been plagued with disasters and delays, it doesn't seem like Russia has given up on it, at least yet. MiG-29KR (Russian Navy) If Russia figures keeping a token carrier air wing intact is less important than keeping North Korea happy at such a critical time, the MiG-29KRs could be supplied. This would give North Korea the most capable examples of the type. Still, these jets have had their fair share of issues for Russia and the only other operator, the Indian Navy, having a rocky experience operating the type. As for the Su-27, these are also still in small numbers to test and training units and display teams, but frontline operators are now limited to four bases: Krymsk, Petrozavodsk-Besovets, Belbek in Russian-occupied Crimea, and Tsentralnaya Uglovaya. The associated units are now mainly in the process of being re-equipped with more modern Su-30 series or Su-35 Flankers. A Russian Su-27SM operated by the 4th State Air Personnel Preparation and Military Evaluation Center at Lipetsk. Dmitry Terekhov/Wikimedia Commons Overall, this doesn’t leave a huge inventory of readily available MiG-29 and Su-27 fighters for potential transfer to Pyongyang. Making these aircraft available to North Korea at short notice would leave gaps in the VKS fighter force — and potentially also eat into vital training capacity. Also, these hard-worked fighters are now very old, although that’s likely less of an issue for North Korea, used to working with vintage equipment. MiG-29s would make more sense for North Korea since the KPAF already operates them. On the other hand, there are fewer MiG-29s available in VKS use compared with the bigger and more capable Su-27, on which North Korean pilots and maintainers would require a longer period of conversion training. Two female pilots make an appearance in front of a MiG-21 fighter during North Korea’s first airshow in 2016. AP The other option would be to refurbish MiG-29 and Su-27 aircraft from the considerable numbers of these jets that are in long-term storage around Russia. This would be a long and expensive process, however, especially with Russian aerospace overhaul concerns already heavily engaged in supporting their domestic customers, especially to ensure serviceability among combat fleets for the war in Ukraine. It’s worth noting that, outside of the MiG-29 and Su-27, Russia would appear to have a readymade fleet of fighters for transfer to North Korea. A batch of more advanced Su-35s has already been built for Egypt, but that deal collapsed, apparently under U.S. pressure. A proposal to transfer to Iran some of the Su-35s has so far not materialized, which could leave them available for North Korea. On the other hand, Paparo’s statements, referring only to the MiG-29 and Su-27, would seem to rule that out and we still don’t know for sure if the Iranian deal will fall through. One of the Su-35s built for Egypt but never transferred to that country.@nskplanes Whatever the source of the MiG-29 and Su-27 aircraft apparently now headed to North Korea, they will be a welcome addition to the KPAF. But, as we have discussed before, they may well not be the only Russian defense products headed in the same direction. As well as fighters, North Korea would also almost certainly be interested in other Russian technologies, too, whether related to the modernization of other parts of its armed forces or to assist in furthering its own missile and space programs. There have already been indications that North Korea is due to receive air defense systems from Russia — potentially S-400 long-range surface-to-air missiles — and Pyongyang would very likely also covet specific other capabilities, including ballistic missile technologies, especially reentry vehicles, as well as new submarine technologies. On a broader military level, North Korea and Russia have ratified a mutual defense treaty, which calls for each side to come to the other’s aid in case of an armed attack. In addition, the growing relationship between Russia and North Korea has seen increased economic cooperation and energy shipments. Another intriguing dynamic in this affair involves the relationship between Russia and South Korea. While MiG-29s and Su-27s hardly change the power balance on the Korean peninsula, Seoul will likely be alarmed at the prospect of North Korea receiving any kind of defense aid from Russia. A spectator poses for photos before a North Korean MiG-29 during the second day of the Wonsan Friendship Air Festival in Wonsan on September 25, 2016. Photo by ED JONES/AFP via Getty Images ED JONES In the past, the South Korean Foreign Ministry has warned Russia of 'very negative impacts' on its relations with Seoul if it continues to expand its military cooperation with North Korea. This is especially ironic considering that Russia and South Korea previously had a military relationship of their own, primarily based around Moscow delivering various kinds of arms — including armored vehicles and anti-tank missiles — to Seoul as a way of paying back debts incurred during the Soviet era. For now, there are very many questions still to be answered surrounding the anticipated delivery of MiG-29s and Su-27s to North Korea. Importantly, however, these are older and significantly less capable than the more recent Su-35 and Su-57 that at one time seemed to be potentially on the table for Pyongyang. Moreover, their fairly limited presence in the Russian Armed Forces at this point means that it’s not entirely straightforward to deliver MiG-29s and Su-27s at short notice. Perhaps more importantly, however, is the symbolic value of such a transfer, further cementing the growing military partnership between Russia and North Korea, which is playing out in Ukraine and, which, before long, looks like it will also bring about a modest — but badly needed — modernization of the Korean People’s Air Force.

Israel Lays Waste To Syria’s Missile Boats	Pictures and videos have now emerged of the aftermath of Israeli strikes on the Syrian port of Latakia overnight, which destroyed at least six Soviet-era Osa II class missile boats. The targeting of Syrian Navy assets was part of a larger operation Israel launched involving hundreds of strikes aimed at preventing military assets from the now-defunct regime of Bashar Al Assad from falling into the hands of rebel factions.

Israeli ships reportedly employed unspecified surface-to-surface missiles to hit their targets in Latakia. The Israeli Navy does have a variety of corvettes and missile boats, including types capable of firing Harpoon and Gabriel anti-ship missiles, Naval SPIKE Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS), and loitering munitions. Regardless of the munitions employed, as already noted, available imagery shows at least six Syrian Osa IIs were destroyed in the Israeli operation. Also called the Project 205 missile boat, this is a 1960s-era Soviet design the primary armament of which is the equally dated P-15 Termit anti-ship missile (also known in the West as the SS-N-2 Styx). The P-15 is an active radar-guided missile with the baseline version having a range of 25 miles (40 kilometers) and the improved P-15M variant (which Syria is said to have received) extends that out to 50 miles (80 kilometers). An aerial photo shows Syrian naval ships destroyed during an overnight Israeli attack on the port city of Latakia. AAREF WATAD / AFP via Getty Images AAREF WATAD / AFP via Getty Images AAREF WATAD / AFP via Getty Images Osa IIs, which are 127 feet long and displace 235 tons with a full load, can carry up to four of the large P-15s at a time. The boats, which can hit top speeds of around 40 knots, also have a pair of radar-directed AK-230 close-in weapon systems, each armed with two 30mm automatic cannons, one at the bow and the other at the stern.

AAREF WATAD / AFP via Getty Images Prior to last night's strikes, how many Osa IIs the Syrian Navy still had in inventory, how seaworthy they may have been, and whether any P-15 missiles were still available to load onto them, is unclear. Syria previously acquired a mix of even older Osa I types, as well as Osa IIs, with the latter boats being the most capable surface vessels still in service in Syria to any degree prior to Assad's downfall. The available imagery shows other smaller craft were caught up in the Israeli strikes, which also damaged port infrastructure, as seen below.

Israel's actions have drawn criticism from the United Nations, as well as from several countries in the region and the broader Middle East, including Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey. Otherwise, the situation in Syria remains extremely fluid. Various factions are now looking to consolidate their positions after one rebel coalition's lightning advance south to Damascus precipitated the downfall of Assad's brutal decades-long dictatorship this past weekend. Multiple foreign actors beyond Israel, including Russia, the United States, and Turkey, are also actively involved in the country's current affairs. Whatever happens in the coming days, weeks, and months, Israel has already delivered a significant blow to what was left of the Syrian Navy, as well as other military assets belonging to the Assad regime.

Syria’s Suddenly Permissive Airspace Prompts Flurry Of Foreign Ai...	The United States and Israel are capitalizing on the power vacuum left by the demise of the Assad regime in Syria. Israel has carried out a string of attacks that have taken out much of what's left of Assad's weapons caches, naval assets, air force, and air defense systems so they don't fall into the hands of whoever controls Syria next. Facilities tied to Assad's chemical weapons programs and advanced weapons development were also struck. This is in addition to Israeli armor moving into Syria deeper into the Golan Heights to establish a 'buffer zone.' The U.S. has also seized the opportunity to execute large-scale airstrikes across Syria against ISIS. All of this has occurred as Syrian airspace has suddenly become far more permissive than it had been. These actions come amid uncertainty about how the rebels will form a government and who it will align with given that Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) – which led the final uprising – is a U.S.-designated terror group. And considering how chaotic such transitions of power are, especially with so many competing factions in Syria, it's unknown if a wider civil war could erupt and create another even more nebulous power vacuum. It is clearly this uncertainty that the U.S. and Israel are trying to hedge against. Israel and the U.S. getting their licks in during this window of opportunity is something to see. Israel neutered Assad's legacy higher-end and 'unconventional' capabilities, U.S. went after ISIS. Mad scramble in the power vacuum.

That effort 'is a top-tier priority of ours, and making sure that anything with those types of derivatives, which is everything from chlorine to far worse is destroyed or cared for,' a U.S. official told reporters on Sunday. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, ruled out having U.S. troops on the ground in Syria to assist. 'I would not envision a scenario where we have U.S. boots on the ground for such a mission,' the official said. 'I think we have ways to take care of these things. But it is a primary focus.' The key to securing the chemical weapons is having Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) inspectors’ boots on the ground, David Adesnik of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) told us. 'The U.S. has ample incentives it can use to encourage Damascus to cooperate if its cooperation is for sale,' he said of relations with the government replacing Assad. 'We can adjust the speed at which we lift sanctions on Syria or contribute to reconstruction. Damascus also needs us to help broker a rapprochement with the Kurdish-led SDF, which is sitting on top of most of Syria’s oil and gas.' CENTCOM’s airstrikes came after President-elect Donald Trump stated on social media that America has no business in Syria, where there are still about 900 U.S. troops. Trump's reaction to the fall of Assad likely offered a preview into what could be a more hands-off approach to that country. 'There was never much of a benefit in Syria for Russia, other than to make Obama look really stupid,' Trump said on his Truth Social social media platform. 'In any event, Syria is a mess, but is not our friend, & THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT. LET IT PLAY OUT. DO NOT GET INVOLVED!' You can see that message below. '…THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT. LET IT PLAY OUT. DO NOT GET INVOLVED!' Says Donald Trump on his Truth Social about Syria while the US has its military presence in Syria. pic.twitter.com/vKUH36Q02g&mdash; Qais Alamdar (@Qaisalamdar) December 7, 2024 It should be noted that in 2017 when he was president, Trump ordered a Tomahawk missile strike on Syrian targets in response to Assad using sarin gas in an attack on Khan Shaykhun that killed hundreds. A year later, however, he decided with little warning and against overwhelming advice from his cabinet and senior advisers to rapidly withdraw all personnel from Syria and end combat operations in the country overall. That action spurred Defense Secretary James Mattis to resign. That move never came to pass before Trump lost his re-election bid to Joe Biden, who maintained a U.S. military presence inside Syria. As noted earlier, Israel is also bombing many targets in Syria and has moved more troops into the demilitarized zone separating the Golan Heights it occupies from the rest of Syria. The goal, according to officials in Jerusalem, is to improve Israel’s security situation by creating a buffer zone and dismantling 'strategic weapons systems' before they can fall into the hands of nefarious groups or even a future Syrian government. 'The only interest we have is the security of Israel and its citizens,' Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar told reporters on Monday. 'That’s why we attacked strategic weapons systems, like, for example, remaining chemical weapons, or long-range missiles and rockets, in order that they will not fall in the hands of extremists.' Saar did not provide details about when or where the strikes took place. However, Fox News reported on Twitter that the Israeli Air Forces (IAF) 'hit over 250 targets in Syria last night hours after U.S. bombers and strike aircraft dropped 140 satellite-guided bombs on ISIS&#8230;' IDF hit over 250 targets in Syria last night hours after U.S. bombers and strike aircraft dropped 140 satellite-guided bombs on ISIS.

Tehran’s ability to rearm that group will be severely hampered by not having Syrian or Russian air forces and air defense systems protecting what was already a porous sky from airstrikes on weapons storage facilities and transshipment points. For 35 years, the Assad regime helped Iran maintain a counterbalance to U.S. and Israeli influence in the region and now that's gone. However, Tehran still has the Houthis in Yemen and several militias in Iraq along with a defanged Hezbollah and a besieged Hamas in Gaza. Speaking of the Houthis, some leaders of the Yemen militant group are reportedly openly disparaging Assad now that he is no longer part of the so-called Axis of Resistance. It *is* news however that many senior officials in the upper echelons of the state in Sana'a can talk about it openly now that Assad has been toppled and fled his country in disgrace, and don't have to keep silent out of respect for internal axis cohesion.&mdash; روني الدنماركي (@Aldanmarki) December 9, 2024 After spending decades and billions backing Assad during the civil war, Iran is facing an internal backlash.

Meanwhile, the fate of Khmeimim Air Base and Tartus Naval Base - its two key military facilities located on the Mediterranean Sea - remains in question. You can read more about that in our latest piece here. The U.S. and Israel aren't the only ones bombarding targets in Syria, either. There is an ongoing proxy war between Turkey and Kurds, with both sides using drone strikes amid fierce fighting in the northern and eastern parts of Syria. U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian forces (SDF) hit Turkish-backed Syrian militants with drones.

As we noted in the opening of this piece, the ferocity of these strikes are largely opportunistic in nature. Concerns about equipment and capabilities falling into the hands of current and potentially future enemies is one driver, but the ability to operate over the country freely is a new development. A complex arrangement of loose norms and constantly morphing deconfliction channels existed for some actors to share the airspace to a limited degree, but the western part of the country remained a relatively high-threat area. This is especially true when it comes to Israel's air operations. Often times the IAF would use standoff munitions to keep manned fighters outside of the highest-risk areas, if possible. With Assad's regime gone and the husk of his military in disarray, as well as Russia's degraded air picture and need to protect its immediate interests, now is clearly seen as the time to strike. Israel, in particular, is working to reduce the future risk of a hostile Syrian regime by neutering what was left of Assad's more advanced and deadly military capabilities. Thus the free-for-all of sorts in terms of the application of airpower over the country in the last 48 hours or so. The ongoing airstrikes in Syria come amid uncertainty about what kind of government the HTS-led rebel alliance will form. HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Julani has emphasized a new approach, delivering a message of inclusion. In a speech following the capture of Damascus, Julani said the Syrian people are the 'rightful owners' of the country after Assad's ouster and declared a 'new history' has been written for the entire Middle East, Al Jazeera reported. 'We [the Syrian people] are the rightful owners [of this country]. We have been fighting, and today we have been rewarded with this victory,' he said. However, there are still concerns about what direction Julani might take and if he can even wrangle enough of Syria's warring factions to create a stable government. Saudi Arabia, a Sunni nation that has battled the Shia Houthis in Yemen backed by Iran, is calling for 'unified efforts to safeguard Syria's unity and cohesion. These efforts are essential to protecting Syria from sliding into chaos and division, The Kingdom affirms its support for all measures aimed at achieving Syria's security and stability while preserving its sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity.'

'Qatar plans to speak with Mohamed al-Bashir, an HTS leader, on Tuesday, the day after he was appointed to lead Syria's transitional administration,' Reuters noted. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose forces are striking targets in Syria and pushing deeper into the country at any time since 1973, offered a mixed message on Monday about his nation's approach to a new government in Damascus. 'If we can establish neighborly relations and peaceful relations with the new forces emerging in Syria, that's our desire,' he said. 'But if we do not, we will do whatever it takes to defend the State of Israel and the border of Israel.' A U.S. official on Monday told The War Zone that it was too early to say what approach America will take to Syria's new leaders. However, Washington said it will assess not just their words, but their actions. 'After 14 years of conflict, the Syrian people finally have reason for hope,' U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement on Sunday. 'The Assad regime’s refusal since 2011 to engage in a credible political process and its reliance on the brutal support of Russia and Iran led inevitably to its own collapse. The United States strongly supports a peaceful transition of power to an accountable Syrian government through an inclusive Syrian-led process. During this transitional period, the Syrian people have every right to demand the preservation of state institutions, the resumption of key services, and the protection of vulnerable communities.' 'We have taken note of statements made by rebel leaders in recent days, but as they take on greater responsibility, we will assess not just their words, but their actions,' Blinken added. 'We again call on all actors to respect human rights, take all precautions to protect civilians, and to uphold international humanitarian law.'

Fate Of Russia’s Prized Syria Bases: What We Know	What will happen to highly strategic Russian air and naval bases in Syria is now very much now an open question following the downfall of long-time strongman Bashar Al Assad. Though Russia has pulled back forces, it is unclear whether there are plans to abandon the crucial facilities for good. There are now signs that the Kremlin could be looking to cut a deal with the same rebels it has spent the better part of the last decade fighting. The current situation in Syria is extremely fluid following the final and total collapse this weekend of the brutal decades-old Assad regime. It took the Command of Military Operations rebel coalition, with Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) at its helm, some two weeks to steamroll its way from areas under its control in the northwest to the capital Damascus. Other rebel factors, including U.S.-backed predominantly Kurdish forces in the east, had subsequently launched their own offensives. The full map of Syria now looks like this &mdash; MAKS 24 (@maks23.bsky.social) 2024-12-08T14:55:37.281Z Rebel forces are now in at least de facto control of Syria's Latakia and Tartus regions, which are home to Russia's Khmeimim Air Base and Tartus naval base, respectively.

Maintaining access to Khmeimim and Tartus, if feasible, would be a top priority for the Kremlin. As The War Zone has previously explored in detail, the bases are of great importance to Russia well beyond its operations in Syria. The Russian government has also spent considerable resources to expand their abilities to serve as strategic regional hubs for air and naval operations, as well as key logistics nodes, especially for activities across Africa. Tartus also notably provides the Russian Navy with its only current warm-water port facility with direct access to the Mediterranean. The airfield offers a similarly unique point of power projection for the Kremlin. 2/ Russia has leveraged its Tartus naval base to project power in the Mediterranean Sea, threaten NATO's southern flank, and link its Black Sea assets to the Mediterranean Sea. pic.twitter.com/BXsxwQPHTg&mdash; Institute for the Study of War (@TheStudyofWar) December 9, 2024 4/ Russia could seek to leverage its presence in Libya or Sudan as alternatives, but the lack of formal agreements with these countries and insufficient infrastructure makes them inadequate substitutes. pic.twitter.com/YkaMwM4Hhb&mdash; Institute for the Study of War (@TheStudyofWar) December 9, 2024 The Russians are starting to get very nervous… They write that the loss of Syria as a refueling and logistics point undermines all of Russia's efforts on the African continent. pic.twitter.com/s4h5hWVgBk&mdash; MAKS 24 (@Maks_NAFO_FELLA) December 9, 2024 Russia's immediate bargaining position is complicated by the fact that it intervened militarily in 2015 on Assad's behalf and very actively fought for years to keep that regime in power. Russian operations in Syria were characterized by at best indiscriminate attacks on areas full of civilians and at worst deliberate targeting of civilian infrastructure, especially hospitals. The Kremlin also worked to shield Assad's regime from broader international repercussions, including over its use of chemical weapons. Russian combat aircraft were flying sorties against anti-regime forces as recently as last week. There were also reports of ships in port at Tartus and/or forces ashore there firing missiles at rebels at they advanced. The Kremlin has made a further statement in this regard by giving Assad asylum in Russia, at least for now. Proof of this remains elusive. Regardless, doing so does give the Kremlin an additional bargaining chip as many groups are likely to be looking for accountability of various kinds from the former Syrian dictator.

He’s useless now, if there was a payment it already was received. Just a thought experiment.&mdash; Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) December 9, 2024 On top of all that, Russia officially designated HTS, which now says it is looking to form a transitional Syrian government, as a terrorist group in 2020. HTS evolved from the Al Nusra Front, which at one point was Al Qaeda's main franchise in Syria, but claimed to have broken away from the international terrorist organization in 2016. The United States and the United Kingdom, among others, have also officially designated HTS as a terrorist group. The U.S. has a $10 million bounty out on Jolani himself. HTS is also just one of a number of rebel factions that control substantial territory across Syria and which Russia has listed as terrorists over the years. This includes the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces in the east, which American authorities say they will continue to support ostensibly to guard against ISIS taking advantage of the current situation. Over the weekend, U.S. B-52 bombers, F-15 Strike Eagle combat jets, and A-10 Warthog ground attack aircraft struck dozens of ISIS-linked targets, underscoring that ongoing mission. However, over the weekend, President-elect Donald Trump also declared 'THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT' in a post about Syria on social media and has pushed for withdrawing U.S. forces from there entirely in the past.

Moscow has long had an on-again-off-again relationship with Ankara, particularly with regard to the Syrian civil war. The HTS-led advance from the north notably marked the final collapse of a ceasefire deal Russian and Turkish authorities had brokered in 2020. CNN Turk reported yesterday, without appearing to cite any sources, that Russia had requested Turkish help in withdrawing forces from the country, but also that the Kremlin would retain its Khmeimim and Tartus bases. At the same time, there are signs that the Kremlin is already looking, if possible, to engage with whatever regime now emerges in Syria. 'It's premature to talk about it yet,' Dmitry Peskov, spokesperson for Russian President Vladimir Putin, told reporters earlier today, according to Reuters. 'This is all a subject for discussion with those who will be in power in Syria.' 'Of course, everything is being done now that is necessary and everything that is possible in order to get in touch with those who can deal with security,' he added. 'And, of course, our military is also taking all necessary precautions.' 'We are in dialogue with Ankara and other regional states, including on Syrian affairs,' Peskov further noted. 'Indeed, Syria is going to have a very difficult period now, due to instability. And, of course, it is very important to maintain a dialogue with all regional countries here. We are determined to do this.'

'This new triumph, my brothers, marks a new chapter in the history of the region, a history fraught with dangers [that left] Syria as a playground for Iranian ambitions, spreading sectarianism, stirring corruption,' HTS leader Ahmed Hussein Al Shar'a, better known by his nom de guerre Abu Mohammad Al Jolani (or simply as Jolani), said in a victory speech yesterday, according to CNN. Jolani did not mention any other country by name. Iran had also been a major supporter of Assad both directly and through the Iranian-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. For groups like HTS, despite past history, Russia, along with China (which has called for a 'political solution' to Syria's future), may offer the possibility of more pragmatic and pliable partners, at least in the near term. The United States and the United Kingdom notably say they have no current plans to de-list HTS as a terrorist group. What happens now to Russia's prized bases in Syria, and its broader influence in the country, is uncertain, but there are signs that the Kremlin is not yet completely over.

UK’s 757-Based ‘Excalibur’ Avionics Testbed For Tempest Future Fi...	The United Kingdom has taken an important step toward its Tempest next-generation fighter, with the start of a trials campaign for the Flight Test Aircraft (FTA), nicknamed Excalibur, which will serve as a flying laboratory for the new combat aircraft. Based on a Boeing 757 airliner, the FTA joins a growing band of dedicated trials aircraft that are being used to prove out technologies for current and future-generation fighter programs, also in the United States and China. In a joint statement today, the two prime contractors responsible for the FTA — Leonardo and 2Excel — and the U.K. Ministry of Defense announced that the aircraft has successfully completed its first phase of modification and flight testing. The aircraft has been fitted with new side and belly pods, which were assessed for stability during flight. The latest Tempest configuration. BAE Systems These fairings are designed to host the Integrated Sensors, Non-Kinetic Effects (ISANKE), and Integrated Communications Systems (ICS) that Leonardo is developing as part of its work on the Global Combat Air Program (GCAP) — the overarching effort that has the Tempest crewed fighter at its core. While GCAP involves the United Kingdom, Italy, and Japan, the Tempest also falls within the remit of the U.K.’s Future Combat Air System (FCAS) program. This is a wide-ranging effort that also includes advanced uncrewed platforms, next-generation air-launched weapons, networks and data sharing, and more. An earlier BAE Systems graphic from the Tempest program shows some of the key ancillary systems and technologies that are being developed alongside the crewed fighter. BAE Systems That the FTA was now in the air had been confirmed by several recent sightings of the aircraft operating out of QinetiQ’s Boscombe Down facility in Wiltshire, southern England. The FTA performs a test flight over southern England last week. Ian Turner At this point, the FTA has the fairings for the various ISANKE and ICS components, but the actual technology demonstrator systems are yet to be installed. It’s unclear exactly when these will be added, with today’s announcement only stating that it will start to fly with them 'within the next years.' Once installed, onboard scientists and engineers will then test and refine the systems during flight trials, de-risking critical technologies for the Tempest and GCAP/FCAS and accelerating the development program — if all goes to plan. Concept artwork of the 757-based Excalibur flying testbed. 2Excel Before that, Excalibur will undergo further engineering work at Boscombe Down, which will include adding a fighter-style nose cone, to host the Tempest’s advanced new radar. This radar is being developed by Leonardo under the Multi-Function Radio Frequency System program. Artist’s renderings of the final FTA configuration also show additional fairings under the nose — perhaps for an electro-optical sensor — and on the side of the nose. Two further fairings are also shown below the rear fuselage. A computer-generated artwork shows the final planned Flight Test Aircraft (FTA) configuration. 2Excel A close-up of the forward fuselage fairings on the Flight Test Aircraft (FTA). 2Excel In the past, 2Excel has stated that Excalibur is planned to have a maximum payload capacity of 16 tons and will operate at an altitude of 42,000 feet at speeds as high as Mach 0.86. The aircraft has a maximum range of 3,900 nautical miles and an endurance of eight hours. While there’s a long tradition of using surrogate aircraft as avionics testbeds, it’s interesting that the narrowbody 757 is forging something of a niche in this field. Honeywell’s 757 testbed with an HTF7000 turbofan engine installed on the aircraft’s third pylon for a test-flight program. Honeywell In the United States, Honeywell has long used a 757 for test duties, while Boeing’s 757 Flying Test Bed — better known as ‘The Catfish’ due to its unique and highly modified nose profile — is used in support of the F-22’s sensor and electronic warfare suite. It features a Raptor nose grafted onto the forward fuselage, containing the AN/APG-77 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar. A swept-wing section atop the flight deck houses conformal antennas for the Raptor’s AN/ALR-94 electronic support measures suite. A close-up of the Boeing Catfish. @Task_Force23 The Catfish also seems to have influenced at least one similar platform operated by China. Here, a specially adapted Russian-made Tupolev Tu-204C — itself essentially a clone of the 757 — is used for avionics testing for the J-20 stealth fighter. According to the prime contractors, the British FTA program 'remains on schedule and is proceeding at pace.' Previously Leonardo has said that Excalibur will begin its Tempest flight tests between 'mid-2026 and mid-2028.' A high tempo is certainly a prerequisite of the program since plans call for a supersonic crewed fighter demonstrator aircraft for the Tempest program to be in the air by 2027. Then, the finished Tempest fighter is expected to be in service by 2035. As we reported earlier this year, the building of the demonstrator for the Tempest, so far only known as the Flying Technology Demonstrator, is now underway at the BAE Systems facility in Warton, northern England. As of this summer, over 50 percent of the aircraft, by structural weight, was already being built or had been completed. The demonstrator takes shape on the production line at Warton. Team Tempest As well as the demonstrator’s crew escape system — tests of which have apparently been completed — there has been parallel work on the powerplant. Aerodynamic engine testing has taken place at the Rolls-Royce facility in Filton, England. With the Flying Technology Demonstrator primarily concerned with proving the configuration and dynamics of the Tempest design, it will be down to Excalibur to test the major subsystems. At the same time, there will be a heavy reliance on simulation, including using a digital representation of the Flying Technology Demonstrator that has already been ‘flown’ extensively. In the meantime, the future of the Tempest has begun to be questioned in some quarters. In particular, as the U.K. Ministry of Defense is grappling with budget cuts, which have seen it prematurely retire a range of current assets. This has led to some concern that defense spending priorities may affect future air power efforts, with one possible outcome being a reduction in the priority assigned to the Tempest program. The 757-based Excalibur flying testbed during a test flight prior to its conversion. 2Excel Ultimately, the Tempest could find itself competing for funds with various other big-ticket defense programs, including new nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines. There is also the fact that the United Kingdom is currently still planning on procuring more F-35B stealth fighters, although the exact fleet size for the U.K. Lightning Force has yet to be finalized. Alongside this, there are all the regular challenges involved in developing a new fighter from scratch, especially one incorporating stealth technologies. In programs like these, long development times and high costs are the order of the day. With that in mind, the work of the Excalibur Flight Test Aircraft will be even more important, to ensure that the Tempest program meets its highly optimistic targets.

Australian Navy Fires Tomahawk Cruise Missile For The First Time	Australia has become just the third country to launch a Tomahawk land-attack cruise missile (TLAM) after the Royal Australian Navy’s (RAN) Hobart class destroyer HMAS Brisbane (DDG-41) successfully test fired the long-range weapon for the first time during its current deployment off San Diego, the RAN announced Monday. Australia now joins the United States and the United Kingdom in having the capability. The test fire comes as Brisbane is in the midst of a so-called 'interchangeability deployment' off the American West Coast, and the X account WarshipCam spotted the destroyer pulling in and out of Naval Base San Diego over the past week. Brisbane spending time in SoCal reflects the ever-deepening military ties between Washington and Canberra. The TLAM’s 1,000-mile range instantly beefs up the RAN’s firepower over great maritime distances, a welcomed capability should war with China break out. They can strike ships or shore targets, and they would be a very well-proven standoff weapon in a fight where Beijing seeks to keep the United States and its allies at a distance via anti-access defenses. Tomahawks can also loiter over a target or be tasked to hit another target mid-flight via a satellite data link. Australia isn't the only nation in China's vicinity to pursue Tomahawk missiles. Japan inked a $2.35 billion deal with the United States to acquire 400 of the missiles and support equipment in January 2024, USNI News reported then. 'The successful test firing of the Tomahawk missile demonstrates the strength of our alliance and defence cooperation with the United States, in support of a peaceful, stable and prosperous region,' Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Richard Marles said in a statement. 'By enhancing our own Defence capabilities, and by working with partners, we change the calculus for any potential aggressor so that no state will ever conclude the benefits of conflict outweigh the risks. HMAS Brisbane fires its first TLAM. (Royal Australian Navy) (Royal Australian Navy) The three-ship Hobart class–which in addition to Brisbane includes the class namesake, HMAS Hobart (DDG-40), as well as the destroyer HMAS Sydney (DDG-42), is a sound home for the Tomahawk. The 7,700-tons displacement warships were all commissioned between 2017 and 2020 and are considered Australia’s most modern and capable surface combatants, even as the force moves on plans that would grow the fleet via smaller frigates and optionally crewed warships loaded with missiles. Go here to read TWZ’s past coverage of that vision. Australia is looking to buy more than 200 Tomahawks, both for their Hobart class destroyers and for future platforms, the defense ministry said. The U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency announced last year that the ally had requested to buy up to 200 Tomahawk Block V All Up Rounds, and 20 Tomahawk Block IV All Up Rounds, as well as the associated equipment required to field them, for $895 million. Aside from Tomahawks, it’s been a time of change and new capabilities for the Hobart class in recent years. The Sydney successfully fired an anti-ship Naval Strike Missile (NSM) in August 2024 during the multinational Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise, Richard Thomas at Naval Technology reported. The NSM, with its stealthy design and secondary land-attack capability has been gaining in popularity with fleets around the globe, including America’s, and replaces the Harpoon anti-ship missile aboard those Australian warships. It is slated to be installed on the destroyers and the Anzac-class frigates under a deal inked in 2023, USNI News reported. HMAS Sydney (DDG-42) fires a Naval Strike Missile as part of Exercise Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) 2024. (Royal Australian Navy) LSIS Daniel Goodman Hobart successfully fired a SM-2 Standard Missile for the first time in 2019, according to the Australian government. In August 2024, Sydney fired Australia’s first SM-6 missile as well. That missile will be 'progressively deployed' aboard the class and on future Hunter class frigates, according to the government. The SM-6 is the only missile capable of taking on anti-air, anti-surface, strike and elements of ballistic missile defense, according to past TWZ reporting and its manufacturer, Raytheon. It was also reportedly used by a U.S. Navy destroyer to take out a Houthi anti-ship ballistic missile (ASBM). And as cutting-edge munitions come online for the Hobart class, the three ships have already been readied by Lockheed Martin to receive enhanced combat systems. The company announced in November 2023 that it had upgraded the class’ design architecture to support Aegis Combat System Baseline 9 capabilities. Baseline 9 will allow the Hobart class to defend against ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and enemy aircraft simultaneously, TWZ previously reported. USNI News reported in May 2024 that the Baseline 9 upgrade work will begin in 2026. Public records show the Hobart class currently sporting Aegis baseline 7.1. A Tomahawk missile fired from Australia's HMAS Brisbane (DDG041) heads for its target. (Royal Australian Navy) U.S. Navy The destroyers also feature 48 Mark 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) cells, which, along with SM-2 and SM-6 missiles, also pack medium-range surface-to-air RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow missiles (ESSMs). The ships are also fitted with a Mark 45 5-inch main gun, MU90 torpedoes, two 25mm M242 Bushmaster chain guns and a Phalanx Close-In Weapons System (CIWS). While it remains unclear when the Hobart class will have all its newer Aegis and weapons systems in place, Brisbane’s deployment turned historic when it fired the Tomahawk. Australian Defence reported that the ship will be home after Christmas following a five-month, so-called 'interchangeability deployment.' A Tomahawk missile fired from Australia's HMAS Brisbane, moments before impacting it's target. (Royal Australian Navy) U.S. Navy Australia’s 2021 announcement that it would buy Tomahawks from the U.S. for its Hobart class came a day after the U.S., U.K. and Australia announced plans to provide the RAN with nuclear-powered attack submarines under a trilateral agreement known as AUKUS. TWZ has previously reported what AUKUS will mean for Australia’s undersea capabilities, which will involve nuclear-powered boats armed with conventional weapons: 'The U.S. plans to sell Australia between three to five Virginia class submarines that carry Tomahawks loaded in vertical launch tubes systems (VLS). However, the first of those boats won’t be delivered until the early 2030s, pending Congressional approval. The new class of SSN AUKUS will also have VLS tubes capable of launching Tomahawks, but they are not currently scheduled for delivery to RAN until the early 2040s.' While the Australian subs are still years away, AUKUS has already produced increased ties, including American boats stopping for maintenance Down Under. The Virginia class sub USS Hawaii (SSN 776) was the first U.S. boat to do so in August 2024. In addition to turning western Australia’s HMS Stirling naval base into a nuclear sub hub, rotational deployments are also being planned there for American and British boats. The Virginia class attack submarine USS Hawaii (SSN-776) departs Australia's HMAS Stirling base after undergoing maintenance. (U.S. Navy) Lt.Cmdr. Rick Moore To prepare for their own nuclear fleet, the first cohort of Australian officers has gone through the U.S. Navy’s nuclear education pipeline, and the first seven enlisted Australian sailors graduated from the U.S. Navy’s Nuclear Power School in October 2024. Meanwhile, Australian entry into club Tomahawk appears to be restricted solely to the Hobart class destroyers for now. Canberra announced in June 2024 that its six Collins class diesel-electric attack submarines won’t be getting the TLAM capability, which will leave the RAN’s undersea force with a firepower gap for years to come, TWZ previously reported. You can read more about that decision here. Brisbane’s Tomahawk firing once again showcases how Beijing’s rapidly advancing military capabilities have pushed traditional Western allies even closer together. Judging by the comments of some AUKUS nation leaders around the globe, that potential is not far over the horizon. 'We are doing everything humanly and legally possible to optimise the Royal Australian Navy’s surface combatant fleet as quickly as possible, as directed by the Australian Government,' Australian Defence quoted Australian Navy Chief Hammond as saying Monday.

Ukraine’s Drone Boats Are Now Shooting Machine Guns At Russian He...	Ukrainian forces say they are now using Sea Baby drone boats armed with heavy machine guns. The Security Service of Ukraine says the machine gun-toting uncrewed watercraft engaged Russian Flanker-series fighters, Mi-8/Mi-17 Hip helicopters, and Raptor patrol boats during a recent attack on targets on the occupied Crimean Peninsula around the Kerch Bridge. The Security Service of Ukraine (SSU, also known by its Ukrainian abbreviation SBU) released a video earlier today, seen below, that it said showed views through the targeting systems on the machine gun-equipped Sea Baby uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) during the attack on the Kerch Bay area on the night of December 5-6. Kamikaze drones were also reportedly involved in the attack, the results of which are not immediately clear. The SSU/SBU has been using Sea Baby USVs for more than a year now and the family has grown to include baseline kamikaze types and other versions with mounted rocket launchers. 'Intercepted Russian radio communication indicates that there are killed and wounded on board the helicopters. The helicopters themselves were significantly damaged and now require major repairs,' according to a machine translation of the caption accompanying the SSU/SBU video on YouTube. 'Also, SBU drones hit a barge carrying military equipment and equipment for the repair of the Crimean Bridge, which the occupiers are still unsuccessfully trying to restore after previous bombings by the Ukrainian special services.' The War Zone has not been able to immediately verify these claims independently. The video does show Mi-8/Mi-17-series helicopters (as seen at the top of this story) and patrol boats being fired on. A Flanker-type fighter is also seen at one point appearing to conduct a strafing run, but the footage does not clearly show the jet being engaged in return. The exact model of Flanker is unclear, but it appears most likely to be an Su-30SM variant from what can be seen, including its forward canards. Russian Su-30SMs regularly operate over and around the Black Sea including in sorties against Ukrainian maritime forces. Screen captures from SSU/SBU video showing, at left, a Flanker-series fighter conducting what looks to be a strafing run (muzzle flash appears to be visible) and, at right, a better look at the jet as it pulls away. SSU/SBU captures A grainy screen capture from the SSU/SBU video said to show another boat in the sights of a gun-armed Sea Baby. SSU/SBU capture When it comes to the actual weapon systems on the Sea Babies, they are 'equipped with large-caliber machine guns' of unspecified types and 'with ballistic programs for automatic guidance and auto-capture of targets,' according to the SSU/SBU video caption. 'These water drones were manufactured as a result of joint fundraising with UNITED24, monobank, Oleg Gorokhovsky, Sergey Sternenko, and Igor Lachen in February of this year.' The video shows views through electro-optical and infrared cameras, along with a targeting reticle and general user interface in line with that seen on remote weapon stations designed for use on ground vehicles and ships. No external views showing the weapon system installed on the drone boats, which could offer more insight into its capabilities, have emerged so far. Whether the gun-armed Sea Babies are also equipped to act as kamikaze drone boats or are intended to be recovered and reused is unknown. As already noted, this is not the first time that Sea Babies have emerged with additional external armament in addition to their internal explosive payloads. The SSU/SBU has employed versions armed with infantry-type shoulder-fired rocket launchers (reportedly RPV-16s loaded with rockets with thermobaric warheads) and 122mm Grad artillery rockets in the past.

Ukrainian sea kamikaze drones attack and destroy Russian Guided Missile Corvette Ivanovets. Tonight. pic.twitter.com/jBs61hXQhb&mdash; Special Kherson Cat (@bayraktar_1love) February 1, 2024 At the same time, Russia's forces have been steadily developing and employing new tactics, techniques, and procedures for countering these drone boats from the air and the sea, as is clear from the SSU/SBU's newly released video. The Russian military has also been implementing a still-growing array of defense measures against drone attacks from the sea and the air, as well as other threats, around the Kerch Bridge and other high-value targets in Crimea and elsewhere in the region. Reports of major Ukrainian USV attacks have notably slowed in recent months. As noted earlier, it remains unclear what damage the Ukrainian attack last week caused to Russian targets in the Kerch area. The emergence of the R-73-armed Magura Vs earlier this year already reflected increased aerial threats to Ukraine's USV operations. As The War Zone has highlighted in the past, the rocket-armed Sea Babies would also provide an additional way to still be able to prosecute attacks, at least on some level, in the face of expanding Russian defenses. Still, there are questions about the effectiveness of the new gun-toting Sea Babies and the general utility of employing the USVs armed in this way. The drone boats are already understood to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars apiece before the addition of the new weapon systems, which would be lost by design if they are still intended to end their missions in a kamikaze attack. Ukrainian decision-making regarding the allocation of its resources now comes amid renewed concerns about the future flow of military aid from the West, especially the United States. If nothing else, the new Sea Baby developments highlight the continued speed of iteration when it comes to uncrewed systems across domains being employed by both sides of ongoing the conflict in Ukraine. Whether gun armament ultimately proves worthwhile, Ukrainian forces are clearly continuing to explore ways to challenge Russian countermeasures to their USV operations.

V-22s Grounded Again After Special Operations Osprey Mishap	A mishap on an Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) CV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft last month has led to an operational pause for the U.S. military’s fleet of the aircraft, which are operated by the Marines and Navy as well. The Marines are pausing all non-essential flights. The Osprey was conducting a training mission at Cannon Air Force Base on Nov. 20 when it experienced 'a material failure' that forced the crew of four to make an emergency landing, AFSOC spokesperson Lt. Col. Becky Heyse told The War Zone Monday morning. There were no known injuries or external damage to the aircraft, she added. A CV-22 like this one from Cannon Air Force Base in New Mexico was forced to land on Nov. 20 after experiencing a material failure. (USAF) As they were flying, the crew started to 'get indications in the cockpit to land as soon as possible,' Heyse explained. 'The incident is under investigation, but the initial indications are that this was another material failure. We believe it was different than what occurred last year.' Heyse was referring to the November 29, 2023 mishap that killed all eight aboard a CV-22 operating off the coast of Japan. A subsequent investigation found that the crash was caused by 'a catastrophic failure of one of the tiltrotor’s gearboxes' and 'decisions made by the pilot.' From our story about the investigation: 'After an analysis of the parts of the left-hand [proprootor] PRGB that could be recovered, it was determined that the catastrophic failure in this instance was 'most likely initiated by a crack in one of the high-speed pinion gears and fatigue cracking of the associated pinion gear’s bearing cage. Additionally, at least one piece of the failed high-speed planet pinion wedged in the high-speed carrier assembly, grinding against the high-speed sun gear’s teeth until finally removed.'' In that flight, the pilot and crew did not 'plan for, deliberate, or even discuss' closer suitable landing options after they received the chip burn warning about the left-hand [proprotor gearbox] PRGB, according to the Accident Investigation Board report. The AIB described as an 'insufficient sense of urgency throughout the entire mishap sequence, beginning with the first PRGB cockpit advisory approximately 49 minutes prior to aircraft impact.' Heyse said it was too early to offer any details about the new material failure. Wreckage of the CV-22B Osprey off Yakushima Island, as photographed by the Japan Coast Guard, November 29, 2023. Japan Coast Guard The entire fleet of U.S. Ospreys was finally cleared to fly again in March, which you can read more about here. Now they are grounded again. 'Out of an abundance of caution, NAVAIR recommended an operational pause for all V-22 Osprey variants Dec. 6, 2024,' said spokesman Neil Lobeda. 'This decision comes following a recent precautionary landing of a CV-22. There were no injuries to the crew. The safety of our V-22 aircrew is our top priority. We are committed to ensuring our Sailors, Airmen and Marines are able to successfully complete their missions and return home safely.' All three services have paused their V-22 operations. 'We have a pause right now to our flight training operations, based on the recommendation from NAVIAR,' Heyse told us. 'In response to a NAVAIR recommendation on the V-22 Osprey fleet, the Marine Corps has decided to implement a 96-hour operational pause for non-essential flight operations starting on December 6, 2024,' a USMC spokesman said in a statement. 'This decision underscores our unwavering commitment to the safety of our personnel and the reliability of our aviation platforms. This pause will give us time to determine if any additional measures are necessary to ensure the continued safety and effectiveness of this critical capability. The Marine Corps remains confident in the safety and effectiveness of the MV-22.' Since the Osprey first flew in 1989, more than 400 V-22s have been delivered to the Marines, Air Force, and Navy, as well as the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF), the latter being the only non-U.S. operator of the type. The Marines are by far the largest operator of the Osprey, with some 348 MV-22Bs spread across 17 squadrons. AFSOC has about 50 and the Navy has 36, including one test aircraft. 210825-N-LN075-2010The Marines have paused flying their MV-22 tilt-rotor aircraft. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Jessica Kibena) 'On Dec. 9, 2024, Commander, Naval Air Forces directed an operational pause for all U.S. Navy CMV-22B Ospreys following the recommendation by Naval Air Systems Command,' Navy Cmdr Beth Teach said in a statement. Navy CMV-22Bs.( U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Emma Burgess) The lessons learned from the fatal 2023 crash contributed to the Cannon crew’s ability to land safely, Heyse told us. AFSOC 'updated all procedures after the crash last year,' she said. 'The return to fly part was an increased focus on training and simulators. The initial indicators show that is why they were able to safely land, based on those flight control measures and training taken. We will learn more as the investigation continues. After the November 2023 mishap, all V-22s were limited to flying within 30 minutes of a suitable divert airfield. In particular, this limits the CMV-22's ability to operate from aircraft carriers. The main function of CMV-22B Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft is to perform aircraft carrier onboard delivery (COD). Marine Ospreys from HMX-1 also support presidential airlift mission, primarily carrying the press pool, aids, and Secret Service counter-assault team around, which you can read more about here. This is the latest mishap in a long string of problems for the Ospreys. Overall, the Bell-Boeing tiltrotor has had a checkered history, punctuated by numerous fatal crashes since its first flight in 1989, though U.S. military officials regularly point to a broadly improving track record in the past few decades. For now, we will have to wait and see how long this latest pause lasts, which material part failed, and whether other variants are experiencing the same problem.

Descend Into The Depths Of The Assad Regime’s Massive Bunker	The dramatic collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime over the weekend has yielded some extraordinary scenes across the country, including first glimpses into part of the secretive world of the Syrian dictator — as well as his brother’s labyrinthine underground bunker. Here you can get up to speed on the situation, with our blow-by-blow account of the rebels’ lightning dash to the Syrian capital Damascus, which led to Assad running away from the country — his destination was Russia, which he safely arrived at, according to Moscow's claims, but the exact whereabouts of Assad remain unconfirmed. Among the most remarkable imagery that has appeared in the wake of Assad’s fall is that which shows a huge and modern underground bunker complex, said to be deep beneath the Damascus mansion of Maj. Gen. Maher al-Assad, the disposed dictator’s brother. Maher al-Assad was best known as the leader of the Syrian Army’s Fourth Armored Division, an elite formation tasked with protecting the government from internal and external threats. Clearly he failed in that role.

The facility is so deep that it includes its own funicular-like trolly system used for descending into it. One video begins with an entry to the bunker via a door, presumably in the basement of the mansion, which leads to another reinforced blast door, followed by a staircase, under an arched ceiling. Another blast door then provides access to a much longer tunnel, descending deeper into the ground. Running alongside the stairs, this tunnel features the aforementioned steep, funicular-type railway for assisted and cargo movement access. Different underground chambers are linked with other levels via a spiral staircase. A long tunnel with access provided by steps as well as a funicular-type railway. via X Another view of the same tunnel. Most seem to feature a characteristic vaulted ceiling. via X The underground chambers include offices, sitting rooms, bedrooms, and bathrooms. Many of the rooms have their contents strewn across the floor, but it’s not immediately clear if they were simply ransacked or if desperate efforts had been made by the owners to remove certain important items in advance of the rebels’ assault. One particular room is protected by a heavy vault door, which may have been still locked when discovered. Regardless, we don’t get to see inside this area. An apparently still sealed vault within the bunker complex. via X A caption on one of the videos posted to social media read: 'Massive tunnel complex beneath Maher Assad’s mansion, wide enough for trucks carrying captagon and gold to drive through.' Captagon is another name for the drug fenetylline, which is illegal in most countries and is produced primarily for illicit use, especially in the Middle East. Reportedly, Syria is the largest producer of the drug, accounting for around 80 percent of the global supply. There have been multiple reports describing how revenues from captagon played a major role in propping up Assad’s regime and Maher al-Assad has been labeled as having played a major role in this narcotics trade. A domestic-sized vacuum machine, likely used in the production of narcotics. via X A shrink-wrap machine, also probably used in the production of narcotics. via X As well as gold and drugs, it’s rumored that the same bunker network was also used to store weapons, which would have been used to defend it and the Assad family had they been at the facility when it was breached. Overall, it’s noteworthy just how modern this complex appears. It is conceivable that Iran — which is well known to be very proficient at building underground complexes — might have assisted in its construction. Underground bunkers are used to protect key regime, command and control, nuclear, and weapons storage facilities in Iran, and similar types of bunkers have also appeared in Lebanon. With that in mind, the Maher al-Assad facility could give us an indication of what others look like in Iran. Similar architecture has long been a hallmark of authoritarian leaders around the world, more often than not the product of an unhealthy relationship between power, paranoia, and colossal wealth.

Back in 2018 Assad was filmed allegedly driving his personal Honda Accord into a combat zone on the eastern outskirts of Damascus. As TWZ pointed out at the time, this was clearly propaganda play by the Syrian government, but the use of the no-frills Accord now makes an even starker contrast with the high-end carpool found at the palace. We are still at a very early stage of the post-Assad era and there is certainly much more to be discovered, not only from secretive locations belonging to the leader’s family and its acolytes but also the notorious prisons and other detention centers in which enemies of the regime were tortured and executed. Already, however, the picture is very much one of Assad — and presumably much of his family and close associates — having escaped the country with little to no effort being made to destroy anything left behind.

The Assad Regime Has Fallen, Claims Swirl Around Possible Crash O...	Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad boarded a plane to leave the country on Saturday, according to several media reports. His exit comes 12 days after a surprise uprising made a lightning dash to the capital of Damascus after capturing several major cities along the way. Meanwhile, there are claims that the jet carrying Assad either was shot down or had mechanical problems and crashed over Northwestern Syria. 'Assad left the country for an undisclosed location, fleeing ahead of insurgents who said they had entered Damascus after a stunning advance across the country,' The Associated Press reported, citing an interview with Rami Abdurrahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR). Abdurrahman told the AP that Assad took a flight Sunday from Damascus. 'Bashar Assad leaves for Russia with his family, and is expected to deliver his resignation speech in the coming hours,' the Step News Agency reported on Twitter. بشار #الأسد يغادر إلى #روسيا برفقة عائلته، ومن المتوقع أن يلقي خطاب التنحي خلال الساعات القادمة.#ردع_العدوان #دمشق&mdash; Step News Agency - وكالة ستيب نيوز (@Step_Agency) December 8, 2024 We must stress that the situation is very fluid and Assad's fate remains questionable at this time. New information could significantly change the prevailing narrative circulating in the media at this time. Assad’s reported flight came as the HTS-led rebels stormed into Damascus, The New York Times reported. 'The Syrian factions announced, at dawn on Sunday, that President Bashar al-Assad had left Damascus, calling on the displaced abroad to return to ‘Free Syria after declaring Damascus ‘free,’ while the commander of the Military Operations Administration issued a directive to his forces in Damascus to stay away from public institutions,' Al Hadath TV channel reported. 'The factions said in messages published via the Telegram that Bashar al-Assad had fled and 'we declare the city of Damascus free' adding 'after 50 years of oppression under the rule of the Baath, and 13 years of tyranny.'' The official Iranian Press TV also confirmed the end of the Assad regime. 'President Assad's rule ended: Syrian army command tells officers,' Press TV reported on Telegram. 'The Syrian army command has notified officers that President Bashar al-Assad's rule has ended as militants enter the capital Damascus, an officer says.' There are unconfirmed reports that the Il-76 Ilyushin transport jet that was supposedly carrying him was either shot down or suffered a mechanical problem. Based on its location, it may have been trying to reach Russia's airbase in Latakia, Syria. This has long been seen as among the safest place for the Syrian strongman. 'Unconfirmed information is being circulated about the sudden descent of the plane that was reportedly carrying Assad after it disappeared from radar and dropped suddenly from an altitude of over 3,650 meters to 1,070 meters in a few minutes, just outside Lebanese airspace north of Akkar,' Egyptian journalist Khaled Mahmoued posited on Twitter.

The status of the Alawite enclave on the Mediterranean Sea coast, where Syria's port facilities and Russia's bases are located, remains unclear. Assad is an Alawite and he enjoys very strong support from the ethnic group within Syria's power architecture. The official Syrian SAMA-TV news channel claimed on Telegram that forces loyal to Assad had not withdrawn. 'There is no truth to the news circulated by terrorist media platforms about the withdrawal of the armed forces from the northern Latakia countryside, and the General Command confirms that all this news is false,' SAMA-TV claimed. President Joe Biden and his team 'are closely monitoring the extraordinary events in Syria and staying in constant touch with regional partners,' according to the White House press pool. President-elect Donald Trump hinted at what his foreign policy agenda might look like in regard to Syria, saying the U.S., which has about 900 troops in Syria, should not be involved in that country. 'There was never much of a benefit in Syria for Russia, other than to make Obama look really stupid,' Trump said on social media. 'In any event, Syria is a mess, but is not our friend, & THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT. LET IT PLAY OUT. DO NOT GET INVOLVED!' Israel, meanwhile, said it had reinforced the occupied Golan Heights border with Syria. Jerusalem is eyeing these events warily, wondering what stance HTS and other rebel groups will take toward Israel. 'The Chief of the General Staff emphasized the high level of offensive and defensive readiness, the reinforcement of troops along the border, and the continued monitoring of developments,' the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Telegram. 'He also stressed that, alongside these efforts, we are not intervening in events in Syria, are working to thwart and prevent threats in the area, and are preparing plans for various options. Due to developments, the IDF has reinforced its deployment along the border, including intelligence and reconnaissance units.

What comes next is a major question, including what stance the anti-Assad forces, some of which have concerning ties, will take now that they have gone from a rebel force to a ruling one.

Bunker Talk: Let’s Talk About All The Things We Did And Didn’t Co...	Welcome to a slightly belated Bunker Talk. This is a weekend open discussion post for the best commenting crew on the net, in which we can chat about all the stuff that went on this week that we didn’t cover. We can also talk about the stuff we did or whatever else grabs your interest. In other words, it’s an off-topic thread. The caption to this week’s top shot reads: Storage-tunnel for nuclear missiles at an abandoned soviet military in Brandenburg State, Germany (FHM via Getty) Also, a reminder: Prime Directives! If you want to talk politics, do so respectfully and know that there’s always somebody that isn’t going to agree with you. If you have political differences, hash it out respectfully, stick to the facts, and no childish name-calling or personal attacks of any kind. If you can’t handle yourself in that manner, then please, discuss virtually anything else. No drive-by garbage political memes. No conspiracy theory rants. Links to crackpot sites will be axed, too. Trolling and shitposting will not be tolerated. No obsessive behavior about other users. Just don’t interact with folks you don’t like. Do not be a sucker and feed trolls! That’s as much on you as on them. Use the mute button if you don’t like what you see. So unless you have something of quality to say, know how to treat people with respect, understand that everyone isn’t going to subscribe to your exact same worldview, and have come to terms with the reality that there is no perfect solution when it comes to moderation of a community like this, it’s probably best to just move on. Finally, as always, report offenders, please. This doesn’t mean reporting people who don’t share your political views, but we really need your help in this regard. The Bunker is open!

USS Zumwalt Returns To The Water With A Hypersonic Missile Launch...	The USS Zumwalt (DDG-1000), a very large and stealthy Navy destroyer that has been beset by hurdles for much of its life, was put back in the water Friday after undergoing 14 months of work that saw its original and cost-prohibitive 155mm Advanced Gun Systems (AGS) replaced with launchers that will eventually fire Intermediate-Range Conventional Prompt Strike (IRCPS) hypersonic missiles. Photos released by shipbuilder HII don’t show much of the IRCPS, as its position on the deck where the big guns once stood is covered. Still, Friday’s news was years in the making, as the Navy first announced plans to remodel its tiny Zumwalt class fleet to field next-generation hypersonic missiles in November 2021. While the Zumwalt class was originally supposed to grow to 32 ships, the Navy ended up buying only three. Part of its original mission was gun fire support for amphibious operations, but the Navy never bought ammunition for its guns that would fulfill that role. This was largely due to the 155mm Long-Range Land Attack Projectiles (LRLAP) rounds fired from the ship’s two Advanced Gun Systems (AGS) costing $800,000 each. The USS Zumwalt (DDG-1000) back in the water after its hypersonic missile launcher upgrade. (HII) (HII) Ship costs also soared over their lifetime, from an original estimated $1.3 billion per ship in 1998 to more than $9 billion by late 2020, according to the Government Accountability Office. The fact that only three ships were purchased also meant that all development and future upgrade costs would only be spread across a tiny fleet less than one-tenth the size of what was originally planned. Citing the ongoing nature of the work, Naval Sea Systems Command declined to confirm what the hypersonic upgrades will cost. The future USS Lyndon B. Johnson (DDG-1002), the third and final ship in the class, will be the next to receive the IRCPS capability once Zumwalt’s work is done, Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) told TWZ this week. LBJ wasn’t built with the AGS installed, so less work will be needed to install the hypersonic missile capability, but the addition of the missiles will push the ship’s commissioning date from this year to 2027, according to NAVSEA. A rendering of USS Zumwalt (DDG-1000) firing a hypersonic missile. (Lockheed Martin) An artist's rendering of the USS Zumwalt firing a hypersonic missile. (Lockheed Martin) The second Zumwalt class ship, USS Michael Monsoor (DDG-1001), is operating out of San Diego and will get its own hypersonic capability installed during a future yard modernization period, although NAVSEA did not clarify when that will take place. Navy budget request records for this fiscal year show the sea service is looking to have all three ready to go by Fiscal Year 2028. While HII said they are not yet finished with the ship’s upgrade, Zumwalt’s eventual return to the fleet with a hypersonic missile capability marks the start of a potential redemption arc for the controversial class of ships. Partially due to its ammoless guns, the type has largely been one without a clear mission, despite the array of cutting-edge, albeit watered-down, technologies onboard. But IRCPS could prove the Zumwalt’s worth, because the hypersonic missiles the class carries would be reserved for very high-value, well-defended targets. They will be loaded into the ship’s triple-packed Advanced Payload Module (APM) cannisters that are now situated where the guns once were, according to past TWZ reporting. IRCPS and the U.S. Army’s hypersonic effort, the ground-based Dark Eagle Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW) system, are the same missile design and have a shared unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicle on top, with the only difference being how they are launched. (U.S. Navy) Such missiles will use rocket boosters to get their payload to the desired altitude and speed. At that point, the glide vehicle will separate from the rest of the booster and make its way toward its target through the atmosphere at very high speed along an unpredictable trajectory. Hypersonic velocity is defined as anything beyond Mach 5, but these weapons will far exceed that threshold. But it remains unclear when Zumwalt will head out to sea with actual hypersonic missiles onboard. The U.S. Army got its first Dark Eagle missile launcher prototype in October 2021. It scrapped three test launches in 2023. The Navy and Army conducted a test fire in June but have not disclosed the results. Navy budget requests in recent years indicated that the sea services wants to fire hypersonics from Zumwalt by the end of 2025. TWZ has previously reported on the benefits these speedy systems will provide: 'Boost-glide vehicles are also designed to be highly maneuverable, allowing for more unpredictable movements over the course of their flight compared to typical ballistic missiles, even those with advanced maneuverable reentry vehicles. This presents significant challenges for opponents in terms of detecting the incoming weapon and responding to it, including any attempts to intercept the threat. Giving an enemy less time to react also reduces their ability to relocate critical assets or just seek cover. All of this, in turn, means hypersonic weapons present an ideal choice for penetrating through even the densest air and missile defenses to strike high-value and potentially time-sensitive targets.'

(U.S. Army) Each of Zumwalt's four large diameter tubes can fit three missiles, allowing for up to 12 in all, and the sea service will set requirements for how many missiles the ships will field for any given operation, USNI News' Mallory Shelbourne reported in November 2024. And while the Zumwalt class will be hypersonic-ready going forward, other facets of the ship remain unchanged. The Navy previously said the IRCPS capability doesn’t require extra space aboard the ship, and would instead take up the space previously used by the guns. DDG-1000s will continue to sport 80 Mk 57 Vertical Launch System (VLS) cells. A host of missiles could be loaded into the refitted Zumwalt, including SM-2 Block IIIAZ and Evolved Sea Sparrow surface-to-air missiles, as well as Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles and potentially variants of the SM-6 missile family. Despite the class’ capabilities being diluted over the decades, and while some external system add-ons have increased the class’ radar signature, their stealthy design could help the ships sneak within range of targets that sit inside enemy territory, something that would be critical to countering China’s long-range defenses in the Pacific. The Navy destroyer Michael Monsoor (DDG-1001) underway in 2002. (U.S. Navy) The Zumwalt class has a huge, 14,500-ton displacement for a ship categorized as a destroyer. That is about one-third greater than Flight IIA Arleigh Burke class destroyers. It also boasts a stealthy design and multiple spectrum signature reduction–including electromagnetic emissions, radar, acoustic and infrared–that make it largely unprecedented for a ship of its size. Zumwalt can also generate a gaudy 78 megawatts of electricity, enough to power nearly 10,000 average American homes. And even while speeding along at 20 knots, the ship class still holds a sizable 58 megawatts of reserve power. The destroyer’s cutting-edge Integrated Power System means enough power has been kept in reserve to provide current to next generation radar systems and directed energy weapons. Still, with just three ships in the class, all packed with unique hardware, the cost of sustaining and upgrading these ships, including their stealthy features, will be hefty over time. There is talk of potentially replacing their proprietary radar and combat system with versions of the Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar (EASR) and Aegis Combat System to help with sustainment. Zumwalt's radar-absorbant material (RAM) coating looking very rough after months of dry dock time. (HII) While they have ventured into the western Pacific, the class has not been on a traditional cruise. But now that Zumwalt is approaching a final baseline configuration, nearly a decade after it was commissioned into service, Navy brass are hoping it can be a next-level contributor to the fleet, even if that capability has come relatively late in DDG-1000’s life.

Former Trump Acting SECDEF Talks About The Future Of Big Ticket D...	The Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program, just punted by the Biden administration to the next administration, is one of many big-ticket defense initiatives that will be closely scrutinized by President-elect Donald Trump's national security team, his former acting defense secretary told The War Zone in an exclusive interview Thursday afternoon. These are decisions that will affect hundreds of billions of dollars in defense spending and tens of thousands of jobs. You can read more about yesterday's NGAD decision here. NGAD, described by the Air Force as a 'family of systems,' includes its crewed sixth-generation stealth combat jet. The Air Force was already conducting a deep review of its NGAD plans, due to be completed before the end of the year. A rendering of Lockheed Martin's concept for an NGAD sixth-generation stealth fighter. (Lockheed Martin) Lockheed Martin 'I feel it is highly likely that the incoming team will take a very careful look at all major acquisition programs and try to bring coherence to them, and more importantly, determine if these are the necessary capabilities to fight in the future operating environments that, frankly, these legacy systems are not optimized for,' said Chris Miller, who served under Trump from Nov. 9, 2020, until Jan. 20, 2021. He spoke to us as a former cabinet member, not a representative of Trump’s new administration. 'The defense primes have such outsized influence,' he said when asked about the future of NGAD and other programs. '[Frank Kendall] the Chief of Staff of the Air Force recognized NGAD needs to be relooked or rescoped.' Miller acknowledged that he doesn’t have 'in-depth knowledge to pass judgement' about NGAD, 'but I can say with a degree of confidence that the NGAD program and others …will get looked at and probably a determination will be how made about how this fits into the new era of warfighting. As we return from quantity to quality, how we use military force to deter our enemies - and if not, how to fight and win - is the overarching concept.' Miller, who dealt with the nuclear trident and hypersonic weapons procurement during his short time at the Pentagon, singled out several programs he surmises will likely be closely examined. Many are among the U.S. government’s biggest expenditures. Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). The B-21 Raider long-range stealth bomber. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Army systems like the Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) tiltrotor replacement for the UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter; Long Endurance ISR; the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle and the overall quantity of heavy armor. The B-21 Raider stealth bomber program is one of several that will be closely reviewed by the new Trump administration, his former acting defense secretary told us. (USAF) USAF In addition to specific weapon procurements, Trump's team will likely also scrutinize the Pentagon’s $1 billion Replicator program, Miller said. It was designed by the Biden administration to overcome 'the PRC’s biggest advantage, which is mass: more ships, more missiles, more people,' Asst. Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks said when it was first unveiled in August 2023. Former Acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller, who served under the last administration, says the new one will closely examine several big-ticket weapon system procurement plans. (Photo by: HUM Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) HUM Images In May, AeroVironment’s Switchblade 600 loitering munition was the first weapon the Pentagon announced by name that it would buy for Replicator. The follow-on Replicator 1.2 tranche announced last month includes - among other items - low-cost air vehicles that could evolve into relatively cheap cruise missiles. The Enterprise Test Vehicle (ETV) program, which the Air Force is running in cooperation with the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), was among a second tranche of 'capabilities' to get a boost through the Replicator initiative. At present, four companies – Anduril Industries, Integrated Solutions for Systems, Inc., Leidos subsidiary Dynetics, and Zone 5 Technologies – are currently building prototypes for ETV with the expectation that all of them will be flight-tested. 'Select ETV prototypes will be accelerated to scaled production,' according to the Pentagon’s Replicator 1.2 press release. The next tranche of that effort, dubbed Replicator 2, will focus on counter-drone capabilities but funding for that won't proposed to Congress until the Fiscal Year 2026 Presidential Budget request, according to a September memo from the Pentagon. There was 'a lot of disenchantment in the defense technology, and small business community that were held out of being part of Replicator,' explained Miller, now serving as Chief Strategy Officer for DYZNE Technologies, which develops defense-facing AI-enabled air, land, and sea systems. 'The vast majority went to a handful of nontraditional defense companies.' 'Being a member of the nontraditional defense industry, I can say definitively that a whole bunch of the smaller and midsize up-and-coming defense tech companies were really, really frustrated and frankly disgusted at the way Replicator played out,' Miller explained. 'I don’t know if Replicator will continue as Replicator, it’s a heavy lift, tied to legacy people. It seems much more like a public relations stunt than an actual meaningful method to deliver capability to fielded forces.' Earlier Thursday, we asked the Pentagon's top spokesman about the future of programs like NGAD, Sentinel and Replicator. 'I'm not going to speculate on what future administrations may do, but I can be very confident in saying that we'll do everything we need to do to defend this country,' Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder responded to our question during his afternoon press briefing. Miller said the wrong approach has been taken to how the U.S. buys its weapons. Currently, 'we have it flipped on its head,' Miller stated about the procurement of big-ticket defense items. 'We are developing capabilities and then forcing them into the warfighting concept. We need to get back to the tried and true method, make sure of what our warfighting theory of victory is, and then use that to develop capabilities, instead of individual services creating incredibly complex weapon systems that no longer fit into what we are trying to do.' The new administration, he added, is 'going to go deep into the numbers and have a hard look at whether the American taxpayer gets value out of these systems. We are operating off a very decrepit and poorly produced joint warfighter concept.' There's a lot riding on the mercurial Trump's approach to these systems and we'll have more answers after he takes office on Jan. 20. While he doesn't have any inside information, Miller has more insight than most about what Trump might do. 'Anyone who says they speak for Donald Trump is either lying or stupid,' Miller exclaimed. 'I'm speaking as a national security professional who worked closely with him in the past.'

B-21 Raider Numbers Could Be Boosted With Existing Production Cap...	Should the U.S. Air Force want to buy more of the new B-21 Raider stealth bombers more quickly, it would be able to draw upon capacity that’s built into the production effort, the boss of Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) has confirmed. The disclosure comes as the Air Force increasingly looks at the size of the future Raider fleet, something that is influenced by other new-generation air combat programs, as well as drone developments, and broader budgetary concerns. 'If the Department of the Air Force, the Department of Defense, or Congress directs an accelerated ramp … for the B-21 program, there’s some capability growth within the current complex,' Gen. Thomas A. Bussiere noted, during an event hosted by the Air & Space Forces Association’s Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies, yesterday. Air Force Global Strike Commander Gen. Thomas A. Bussiere. U.S. Air Force photo by 1st Lt. Aaron Chen Aaron Chen Bussiere was responding to a question about the possibility of ramping up B-21 production, including whether other contractors could become involved, in addition to Northrop Grumman. The AFGSC boss said he thought 'the most efficient way' of expanding production would likely 'require opening up another production complex' with Northrop Grumman. However, Bussiere’s response does suggest that there is now not only a possibility of making more B-21s but that there is also some kind of additional capacity for a production ramp-up already. The Air Force’s publicly stated plan has long been to buy at least 100 Raiders. However, as we have talked about in the past, there is the potential that the B-21 force could ultimately become significantly bigger, and this broader topic is the subject of high-level discussion right now. Bussiere thinks now is the right time to 'reevaluate' both the B-21 production total and the rate at which they are procured, noting that the rapidly changing security environment means there will be a greater need for the 'exquisite' capabilities offered by the stealth bomber. 'Who would not want more?' he asked. Noting again that the program of record calls for 'at least' 100 B-21s, Bussiere also pointed to the fact that, in the past, the previous Chief of Staff, Chief of the Air Force, and Secretary of the Air Force all went on record and testified before Congress that a fleet of 220 bombers would likely be needed to meet requirements. Taking into account the current plan to retain 75 upgraded B-52Js, that would require a fleet of 145 B-21s. 'It’s a force mix discussion within the Department of the Air Force, and it’s a resource and priority [question] within the Department of Defense [and] the nation,' Bussiere added. A B-21 Raider conducts a flight test out of Edwards Air Force Base, California. Photo courtesy of Jonathan Case, Northrop Grumman Photo courtesy of Jonathan Case, Northrop Grumman Back in October, Northrop Grumman — currently engaged in progressing ground and flight testing work — also disclosed that the total number of the new stealth bombers could change as part of a force structure review. Kathy Warden, Northrop Grumman’s CEO, talked about the review and added that the Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall 'has been open about looking at the various options they have for increasing their force size,' specifically in relation to the B-21 and NGAD. NGAD is the Next Generation Air Dominance initiative, which includes the Air Force’s crewed sixth-generation stealth combat jet. Yesterday it was revealed that a decision on the path for NGAD has been pushed to the incoming Trump administration, as you can read about here. The fate of NGAD will likely help determine B-21 numbers, especially as the Air Force has talked about the stealth bomber potentially filling in for the sixth-generation fighter jet if that were to be procured in smaller numbers. As we have discussed before, the B-21 will be much more than a long-range bomber, and having it adopt a more ‘air dominance’-type role would not be entirely unexpected. A B-21 at Northrop Grumman’s facility at the Air Force’s Plant 42 in Palmdale, California. U.S. Air Force USAF Not only are the two programs — B-21 and NGAD — already working with some degree of overlap, but they are now competing for precious funds, and a cut to one program would almost certainly influence the other. Even before the Air Force launched its review into the NGAD requirements — which is due to wrap up around the end of this year — there were discussions about B-21 fleet numbers. During a Congressional hearing back in April of this year, Gen. David Allvin, the Air Force’s Chief of Staff, declined to commit to buying more than 100 Raiders. 'It [the B-21] certainly is the future of our bomber force. … 100 is the program of record,' Allvin said at the time. 'I think we’re not going to reach that number until probably the mid-2030s and beyond.' That, of course, could change if the decision is made to accelerate production. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen.

U.S. Air Force photo by Eric Dietrich Eric Dietrich At the same time, Allvin said the service was already looking to 'other technological advancements' to augment the new bombers — a likely reference to Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones. CCAs also came up during Bussiere’s talk yesterday. The AFGSC boss confirmed that the command is looking at the potential for long-range, autonomous CCAs to operate together with the B-21, but he also noted that they first want to wait and see how the concept works in relation to crewed fighters. 'We’re going to let the fighter force kind of mature that concept with [Increment] 1 … and then we’ll be prepared to integrate that into the Long Range Strike Family of Systems, probably at a later date,' Bussiere said. A model of General Atomics’ CCA design for Increment 1. Jamie Hunter 'I won’t get ahead of the Chief or the Secretary, but it’s a logical question to ask, whether long-range strike would benefit from the CCA concept,' Bussiere added. 'Right now, we don’t actually have that in the plan.' Only a day before Bussiere’s talk, another Air Force official, 8th Air Force commander Maj. Gen. Jason R. Armagost, had observed that 'a large aircraft, like a bomber, has many apertures and many radios, and in many cases, more crew members to be able to manage things like' CCAs. That may be true, but there remain questions about the degree of utility that a CCA developed primarily to operate alongside crewed fighters would be able to complement the missions flown by a long-range bomber, which are of considerably greater duration, on average. At the same time, the Increment 1 CCAs referenced by Bussiere are also primarily intended for air-to-air missions, at least at this point. With that in mind, it is somewhat baffling that there is no dedicated companion drone within the Long Range Strike Family of Systems — at least, not one that we know about. But the statements about pairing CCA with the B-21 seem to indicate that it doesn’t have a drone companion capable of tactically assisting it. This potential hurdle is something that Air Force Secretary Kendall has also referenced in the past. In fact, Kendall initially espoused the idea of having CCAs complement long-range bombers, before admitting, in 2022, that 'the idea of similar-range collaborative combat aircraft is not turning out to be cost-effective.' Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall. U.S. Air Force photo by Andy Morataya Andy Morataya While the Air Force plays a waiting game to see how best CCAs — and what type of CCAs — should collaborate with its next-generation stealth bombers, it seems certain that drone developments will also have a major role to play in shaping B-21 force size. At the very least, CCAs are now officially back on the table for AFGSC, too. It’s worth noting that, at the start of this year, Northrop Grumman disclosed a loss of nearly $1.2 billion on the B-21 program, admitting that it also expects to take a financial hit on each of the first five low-rate production lots of the bombers. However, the company still expects to make enormous revenues on the back of the program over its lifetime, even without additional orders. At the time of the Raider’s public rollout in December 2022, the overall program cost was pegged at $203 billion in Fiscal Year 2019 dollars, based on a fleet of 100 bombers, according to a report from Bloomberg. Since then, it has been reported that the cost of those first five low-rate production lots has decreased, from the $19.1 billion budgeted by the U.S. Air Force in 2023 to the $13.8 billion budgeted for 2025, according to figures published by Aviation Week — equivalent to a 28 percent discount. 'I do think in the coming months, we may get a better indication from the Air Force as to how they’re thinking about B-21 quantities in the long run,' Northrop Grumman CEO Warden added, back in October. While officials haven’t spoken openly about any changes to specific B-21 numbers, it’s certainly notable that AFGSC considers that extra production capacity is available, if needed.

Syrian Rebels Closing In On Homs, Cutting Off Damascus From Coast...	There are growing indications that the central Syrian city of Homs is close to falling as rebel forces push south from the newly seized town of Hama. Its capture would represent another stunning blow to the regime of Bashar Al-Assad, which has already lost Aleppo too during this 10-day-old operation. This would put Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS)-led fighters some 75 miles north of Damascus and all but cutting off the capital's access to the coast. The coastal region is a bastion of Assad's Alewite sect and home to Russia's two military bases in Syria. You can read more about the capture of Hama in our story about it here. HTS, the former al-Qaida-linked Al-Nusra Front, claimed on Friday that it had captured two towns six miles north of Homs, Syria’s third-largest city and a strategic gateway to the capital, Damascus, The Washington Post noted. There are also claims that those forces have reached Homs.

(Photo by Izettin Kasim/Anadolu via Getty Images) Anadolu In his first interview with international news media since launching this campaign, HTS leader Abu Mohammad al-Jolani told CNN on Friday that the goal of this drive is to reach Damascus and rid the nation of Assad. 'When we talk about objectives, the goal of the revolution remains the overthrow of this regime,' he told the network. 'It is our right to use all available means to achieve that goal.' The long-standing backing of allies Iran and Russia won't save Assad this time, al-Jolani argued. 'The seeds of the regime’s defeat have always been within it… the Iranians attempted to revive the regime, buying it time, and later the Russians also tried to prop it up,' he added. 'But the truth remains: this regime is dead.' CNN, not Al Jazeera, is the first international tv to interview the HTS leader Jolani.

The assessment mirrors much of what we mentioned in our previous piece. The rebel advance 'threatens the loss of the air strike component, which makes up 75 percent of the combat capabilities of our troops in the [Syrian Arab Republic] SAR,' the Russian Air Force-connected Fighterbomber Telegram channel bemoaned. 'The Khmeimim airfield is not a multi-story construction site with basements, it is a field with easily assembled houses on top, which will cease to function as soon as the enemy either approaches the range of artillery fire, or the range of drones,' Fighterbomber suggested. 'And here it will not be possible to use the maneuver of aviation, which saves us on the mainland.' Homs is about 50 miles east of the Russian naval base in Tartus and about 75 miles north of Damascus. (Google Earth image) Given the terrain and road systems, there is 'nowhere to withdraw,' the channel added. 'In fact, the only reserve airfields left in Syria are two airfields. This is a critical minimum. The situation with the naval base in Tartus is about the same. Of course, it is possible to defend and hold it for quite a long time, if there is someone and something, but it will either not be able to function at all, or very limitedly.' 'It is practically impossible to evacuate the bases,' Fighterbomber suggested. 'In the best case, it is possible to evacuate most of the personnel, documentation and ferry serviceable aircraft.' Russia's main task in Syria now is to hold Latakia, Fighterbomber hypothesized. Resistance to drones 'is also limited by the distance from the mainland with its supplies of missiles and air defense systems,' Fighterbomber posited. 'Therefore, the main task of our forces in Syria is to prevent the enemy from entering Latakia, even if we have to temporarily give up the rest of the territory.' The typically upbeat Kremlin regime blogger Fighterbomber seems unusually downbeat about the situation in Syria, warning that evacuating the remaining airfields and even the naval base could prove extremely challenging. pic.twitter.com/XncDMHamm2&mdash; WarTranslated (Dmitri) (@wartranslated) December 6, 2024 With the anti-Assad forces bearing down on Homs, some regime forces were reportedly seen withdrawing through Deir Atiyah, a town about halfway between Homs and Damascus along the key M-5 highway linking those two cities.

Given the state of play on the battlefield, with Iran's long-held land-routes across Syria that are used to deliver arms and personnel likely disrupted, that most likely means air flights into Damascus, which is under increasing pressure from the HTS-led forces. While those troops have reportedly captured air defense and radar systems, it is unknown if they have the know-how to endanger any aerial resupply efforts. Adding to the logistic woes, Israel has been intercepting flights from Iran over Syrian airspace, forcing them to return to Iran. So how exactly Iran will supply the increasingly physically isolated Assad regime is unclear, regardless of their intent. All this exacerbates the problem created by the Assad regime's potential loss of access to the coast, cutting off all the ports through which supplies could pass. The same is true for just supplying the country as a whole with the goods it needs.

Experimental Ballistic Missile Russia Used On Ukraine Could Be He...	Russian President Vladimir Putin has raised the possibility of forward deploying new Oreshnik ballistic missiles capable of carrying multiple warheads in neighboring Belarus in the latter half of next year. Oreshnik, which U.S. officials have said is an intermediate-range design derived from the RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), first emerged after it was used in an unprecedented attack on Ukraine last month. Putin discussed the feasibility of placing Oreshniks in Belarus during a televised ceremony today in Minsk where he signed a new mutual defense agreement with that country's leader Alexander Lukashenko. With the deal now in place, Belarus, the affairs of which have been ever more deeply intertwined with those of Russia in recent years, is firmly and openly under the protection of the latter's nuclear deterrent umbrella. Russia had already begun deploying nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory in cooperation with that country's armed forces last year. Lukashenko asked Putin to deploy Oreshnik missiles on the territory of Belarus.'I want to publicly ask you to have the new weapons systems and, above all, Oreshnik deployed on the territory of Belarus. This would calm some minds,' said the illegitimate leader of Belarus.Putin… pic.twitter.com/CCRyimMs8U&mdash; Anton Gerashchenko (@Gerashchenko_en) December 6, 2024 'Russia recently successfully launched the Oreshnik. This had a certain impact on our former partners, and now rivals. Do not consider this some kind of impudence, but I would like to publicly ask you to deploy new weapons systems, primarily the Oreshnik, on the territory of Belarus,' Lukashenko said at one point in the ceremony, per a machine translation of his remarks as reported by Russia's Interfax. 'I would very much ask you to think about it and agree to our request.' 'I think this will become possible in the second half of next year, as serial production of these systems in Russia increases and as these missile systems enter service with the Russian strategic forces,' Putin said in response, according to Reuters. 'There are a number of technical issues that must be resolved by specialists, namely, determining the minimum range taking into account the priorities of ensuring the security of the Republic of Belarus,' Putin added, per another machine translation of a report from the Kommersant newspaper in Russia. He also indicated that if Oreshniks were sent to Belarus that they would be under the control of Russian forces, but that Belarusian authorities would have a say in what targets they could be employed against. Details about Oreshnik remain limited. After its use against Ukraine in November, Putin had described it as a 'medium-range missile system' and 'a ballistic missile equipped with non-nuclear hypersonic technology' capable of reaching a peak speed of Mach 10. 'The kinetic impact is powerful, like a meteorite falling,' the Russian President more recently said.

Officials in Ukraine also later said that the warheads contained no explosives, according to Reuters. Whether these were traditional re-entry vehicles, maneuvering ones, or true hypersonic boost-glide vehicles, and what kinds of warheads (conventional or nuclear) they may be able to carry, remain unknown. Larger ballistic missiles, even ones with traditional designs, reach hypersonic speeds, typically defined as anything above Mach 5, in the terminal stage of their flight. U.S. authorities also subsequently said that Oreshnik is an intermediate-range weapon based on the RS-26, the development of which was said to have been shelved in 2018. Officially categorized as an ICBM, there have long been discussions about whether the Rubezh was actually an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) design. IRBMs and ICBMs are defined as having maximum ranges between 1,864 and 3,418 miles (3,000 to 5,500 kilometers) and greater than 3,418 miles (5,500 kilometers), respectively. You can read more about the RS-26 in detail here.

Roman Pilpey / AFP via Getty Images Putin's comments today that Oreshnik is not yet in serial production underscores that the missile remains developmental in nature and that there are only likely a very limited number available currently. The Russian President's note that Oreshnik's minimum range apparently still needs to be definitively determined is also notable. The example that struck Ukraine in November hit a target roughly 500 miles from the launch site in Kapustin Yar. As such, forward-deploying the missiles to Belarus might actually limit the ability to employ them against certain targets, such as those in Ukraine. The straight-shot distance between the far-northern end of Belarus and the Ukrainian border is only around 350 miles at most. Ukraine's capital Kyiv lies just some 56 miles from the boundary with Belarus. There has also been much discussion already about the threat Oreshnik poses to targets elsewhere in Europe, including the capitals of all NATO members in the region. This is something that Russian media has been happy to highlight, as seen below. From launch sites in Belarus, Oreshnik's minimum range could be factor in this context, as well. Belarus directly borders NATO allies Poland, Latvia, and Lithuania, and is also in relatively close proximity to another member of the alliance, Estonia. Russian media released a new graphic showing Oreshnik missile flight times to major cities in Europe pic.twitter.com/Ry7yLymK2n&mdash; Preston Stewart (@prestonstew_) November 22, 2024 Oreshniks could be fired across very high lofted trajectories to hit targets at shorter ranges, but there would still be a limit to what could be achieved in this way. Doing this could also increase the speed at which the missile and/or any payloads it releases are moving in the terminal phase, and the potentially destructive stresses on them, as well. Regardless, having Oreshniks in Belarus could also still be useful for dispersing that capability and shorter-range munitions deployed in that country, including nuclear-capable Iskander-M short-range ballistic missiles, which could still be employed against targets in closer proximity. The missile by itself presents a longer-range strategic-level threat that can be employed without crossing the nuclear threshold, something Russia has visibly demonstrated through the real-world attack on Ukraine. Whether it is also nuclear-capable is unclear. At a peak speed of at least Mach 10 (Ukrainian officials have said the missile fired at them might have actually gotten up to Mach 11), the weapon would also be flying faster than most air and missile defense systems can reliably intercept. The War Zone was quick to highlight the broader signaling to Russia's regional and global opponents behind the very public use of Oreshnik in November. Russian authorities used existing nuclear risk reduction channels to alert the United States to the launch of the missile beforehand. The New York Times reported this week that Russian Army General Staff Chief Valery Gerasimov also told U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Charles Q. Brown in a subsequent phone call that the launch had been in the works for some time. Gerasimov reportedly said the planning predated the U.S. government's decision to allow Ukrainian forces to fire Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) short-range ballistic missiles at targets inside Russia. This was also the first-ever direct call between Gerasimov and Brown, and Brown is said to have agreed to not proactively announce that it had occurred. All of this follows very public announcements by the U.S. military about its intention to send intermediate-range strike capabilities to Germany, and potentially elsewhere in Europe, in the coming years. This includes planned 'episodic deployments' of the U.S. Army's Typhon ground-based missile system, which can fire Tomahawk cruise missiles and multi-purpose SM-6 missiles, as well as that service's still-in-development Dark Eagle hypersonic missile. The U.S. Navy has also demonstrated its ability to deploy containerized launchers related to Typhon, which can be employed in a ground-base mode and also fire Tomahawks and SM-6s, to sites in Europe. A group of four trailer-based launchers and a mobile command post that make up the core of a single US Army Typhon missile system battery.

US Army Exactly when Oreshniks might appear in Belarus and how many missiles might be deployed there remain to be seen. At the same time, the missile is already clearly emerging as a particularly important element of any discussion about the evolving geopolitical environment in Europe and potentially beyond.

USS Carney’s Red Sea Operations Highlight 5-inch Deck Gun’s Anti-...	As U.S. Navy destroyers continue to shoot down Iran-backed Houthi militant drone and missile barrages in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, a new Navy recounting of the first of those engagements, which involved the USS Carney (DDG-64), highlights a seldom discussed secondary application for the ship's Mark 45 5-inch main deck gun — shooting down aerial threats. On Oct. 19, 2023, Carney became the first ship to take out a Houthi missile and drone barrage fired from Yemen following Israel's invasion of Gaza. It was the initial salvo in an ongoing fight that Navy leaders have deemed the most sustained and kinetic action the force has seen since World War II. Details have been previously reported regarding that incident and the missiles used, and other incidents have involved Navy ships leaning on their pricey missiles and even their last-resort, close-in weapon system (CIWS) to stop Houthi barrages during the past 14 months. But little has been said about destroyers using their Mark 45 five-inch main gun during such encounters, a gun normally leveled surface and shore targets. The Carney details released this week are admittedly short on specifics, but they feature personal insights from the sailors who were on the maritime front lines that day. The USS Carney (DDG 64). (U.S. Navy) USS Carney underway. (U.S. Navy photo by Journalist Seaman Apprentice Charles A. Ordoqui 'We were in berthing and heard [an announcement over the ship’s 1MC intercom system] ‘clear the weatherdecks,’ and I remember thinking, ‘what does that mean? I’ve never heard that before,’' Fire Controlman (AEGIS) 2nd Class Justin Parker, a SPY-1 radar technician, said in the Navy release. Parker then recalled hearing missiles and Carney's 5-inch gun being fired. 'We had never done anything like this before – we had only trained to it,' Gunner’s Mate 1st Class Charles Currie, a technician of the Mark 45 five-inch gun, is quoted as saying. 'There was a lot of adrenaline going on – this was real-world now.' All told, Carney spent 10 hours shooting down 15 Houthi drones and four land-attack cruise missiles that day, the first of 51 combat engagements the warship would rack up before arriving back home to Mayport, Florida, in May. Their actions earned the entire crew the Combat Action Ribbon, a distinction that hadn’t been given to an entire ships force since the Gulf War. Navy officials declined to clarify to TWZ what type of rounds were fired by its main gun, what they were targeting or exactly how the main deck gun was employed. Available ammunition types for the gun have included various high-explosive rounds, including proximity-fuzed air-bursting ones, and canister rounds packed with metal balls. BAE, the gun’s manufacturer, says its latest Mod 4 version can accommodate 20 conventional, semi-fixed rounds, 10 extended-length projectiles or a mixture of both in its 20-round loader drum. The ship’s entire magazine houses 600 rounds in reserve as well. Seventy-pound shells for a U.S. Navy destroyer's 5-inch main gun. (U.S. Navy) Some retired surface warfare officers say Carney’s five-inch gun was a prime tool for taking out some of the Houthi onslaught without expending precious stocks of costly Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles, RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missiles (for those ships that have it) or SM-2 missiles. USNI News reported that SM-2s were used to take out the Houthi missiles in that initial October 2023 fight, but such missiles cost millions per unit, and concerns started being raised about the rate of expenditure for such munitions just a few months after that first Carney battle. By the spring of 2024, such clashes had become a near-daily occurrence. And while we don’t yet know what kind of rounds Carney’s gun was firing that day, the Mk 45 mounted on the ship, which has a 13-nautical mile range when firing standard ammo, is capable of taking out a slower-moving aerial target like a Houthi drone. 'A (five-inch) gun can put rounds in the air, which with fragmentation can be effective air defense,' said Bradley Martin, a retired surface warfare officer and current analyst with the RAND think tank. 'Against an (anti-ship cruise missile), not so much.' Among the possible reasons for firing the gun, Carney’s leaders might have determined via flight characteristics that the Houthi ordnance were 'good gun targets' that didn’t require expending costly missiles, according to Jan van Tol, a retired destroyer and amphibious assault ship captain. 'I would be a fan of that kind of approach, i.e., do not always fire at max range with your longest-range weapon, both due to high [financial cost] and having only a limited magazine of them,' van Tol, now a senior fellow with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, told TWZ this week.

(U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Fred Gray IV/Released) MC1 Fred Gray IV Letting a hostile drone get close enough to the ship, where the gun could be employed, could also be the result of a saturated air defense environment, where other capabilities have to be left in reserve for other threats that are being engaged or could appear at any time. The target could have also presented itself only when it was within the deck gun's range. TWZ has previously showcased what the Mk 45 brings to the fight and how they fire 16 to 20 rounds per minute. Such a deck gun is also believed to have helped a Greek warship take out a Houthi drone off Somalia in July. Go here to read more about that incident. The Mark 45 is directed via the ship’s combat systems, including the powerful, 'Wall-E'-looking Mark 20 Electro-Optical Sensor System (EOSS), a critical and highly flexible system that you can read more about here. Representatives from L3Harris, the system’s manufacturer, clued TWZ in on what makes EOSS so unique during a 2019 interview: 'The primary purpose of the system is to provide highly accurate targeting information to the ship’s gun weapon system. In many instances, the ship’s radar may make an initial detection of a potential threat, and the Mk20 is then cued to visually confirm the target, and provide precise range and position for gun engagement. The goal is first shot hit accuracy. Of course, sailors are quite creative and immediately recognize the Mk20’s excellent performance as a situational awareness and navigation aid. We have heard of crews using the Mk20 to visually investigate suspicious vessels, and help navigate through congested waters. The operators find the thermal imaging capability and resolution particularly useful in nighttime operations.' The Mark 20 Electro-Optical Sensor System (EOSS). (TWZ.com) Some Navy efforts that got canceled in recent years would arguably have bolstered the five-inch gun’s capabilities for the Houthi fight, conserving precious missiles in the process. A program that envisioned loading five-inch guns with the speedy and versatile Hyper-Velocity Projectile (HVP) was scuttled in 2021, TWZ reported, but not before the Navy test-fired the rounds during 2018’s Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise. Red Sea observers and missile conservationists might be rueing that decision these days. Options like the HVP were seen as a more cost-effective and magazine-expanding way to take out a variety of threats, naval analyst and retired submarine officer Bryan Clark told USNI News in 2019. 'So if you think about the kinds of threats you might face in the Middle East, the lower-end cruise missiles or a larger UAV, now you have a way to shoot them down that doesn’t require you use a $2 million ESSM or $1 million RAM because a hyper velocity projectile – even in the highest-end estimates have it in the $75,000 to $100,000 range, and that’s for the fanciest version of it with an onboard seeker,' Clark told USNI News’ Sam Lagrone. While the combat effectiveness of the Carney and the destroyers that have succeeded it in the Red Sea fight is undeniable, we don’t yet know the full extent of the role the humble five-inch gun has played in these battles, or whether the Navy is once again considering giving their magazines some extra punch.

The Is The New ‘Counter-Drone Strategy’ Just Unveiled By Pentagon	The Pentagon has released a summary of a new classified strategy to guide efforts to protect American forces abroad and across the U.S. homeland from growing drone threats. This comes as the dangers posed by uncrewed aerial systems have become a national cause celebre due to a number of high-profile incidents. This includes still-unexplained drone incursions over Langley Air Force Base in Virginia last year, as well as more recent incidents in New Jersey and over multiple U.S. facilities in the United Kingdom, all of which The War Zone was first to report on. The new counter-drone strategy is said to build upon a number of existing efforts, including the establishment of the Joint Counter-small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Office (JCO) in 2020. It is also set to tie into a new Pentagon initiative to help speed up the acquisition and fielding of new counter-drone capabilities dubbed Replicator 2. The first Replicator effort has been focused on getting more uncrewed systems into the hands of U.S. warfighters. In addition, the heads of U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) and U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) have been given new synchronizer roles to help coordinate counter-drone preparedness (including the training and equipping of relevant forces) and actual responses to incidents. Counter-drone systems on display at the Falcon Peak 2025 demonstration event earlier this year. DOD 'Enabled by growing commercial innovation and the increasing sophistication of artificial intelligence (AI), autonomy, and networking technology, unmanned systems are fundamentally changing how militaries of all sizes, capacities, and capabilities – as well as non-state actors – achieve their objectives,' the fact sheet on the new counter-drone strategy explains. 'From the Middle East to Ukraine and across the globe – including in the U.S. homeland – unmanned systems are reshaping tactics, techniques, and procedures; challenging established operational principles; and condensing military innovation cycles.' 'At the operational level, these systems are making it more difficult for forces to hide, concentrate, communicate, and maneuver. They allow adversaries to more easily surveil, disrupt, or attack our forces, assets, and installations, potentially without attribution. At the strategic level, unmanned systems provide aggressors with the ability to reduce the initial human, financial, and reputational costs of conflict. The relatively low-cost, widely available nature of these systems has, in effect, democratized precision strike.' These are all points The War Zone has been highlighting for years. In February, we published a feature specifically on how AI looks set to enable major new evolution, if not revolution in lower-end uncrewed aerial capabilities. A Ukrainian drone, with its operator seen in the foreground, drops a payload during training. The heavy use of drones, including weaponized types, on both sides of the conflict in Ukraine has driven help fully drive the threats posed by uncrewed aerial systems into the public consciousness. Scott Peterson/Getty Images 'The Department is mitigating the potential negative effects of unmanned systems on U.S. forces, assets, and installations – at home and abroad. A critical portion of our efforts, particularly in the near-term, comes from improving our defenses, with an emphasis on detection as well as active and passive defenses,' the fact sheet continues. 'The Department will ensure our forces and priority installations have protection. To stay ahead of advances in unmanned systems – and their growing prevalence – the Department will prepare for more advanced challenges, pacing our future capabilities to more stressing cases (e.g., larger numbers of increasingly capable and autonomous systems). Over the mid- and long-term, the Department will also develop and design our future force to reduce their vulnerability and increase their resilience to these threats. Taken together, these approaches will allow the Department to maintain our advances and our ability to fight and win our Nation’s wars, if called upon.' To this end, the fact sheet lays out five specific 'strategic ways' that are central to how the Pentagon will seek to address drone threats through its new strategy, which are as follows: 'Deepen our Understanding and Awareness of Unmanned Systems Trends and Threats. The Department will 'sense and make sense' of threats that unmanned systems pose, including by gaining a greater understanding of unmanned systems threats and by improving the ability of our operational forces to detect, track, and characterize these threats.' 'Disrupt & Degrade Unmanned Systems Threat Networks. The Department will address the threat networks that drive the development and proliferation of unmanned systems whenever possible, including by launching and executing deliberate campaigns to counter these networks, in partnership with other U.S. departments and agencies.' 'Defend Against Unmanned Systems Threats to U.S. Interests. The Department will adapt fully to defending against unmanned systems as a core element of warfighting, including by: improving our active and passive defenses; clarifying, streamlining, and delegating authorities, as needed; and institutionalizing approaches across doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership, personnel, facilities, and policy.' 'Deliver Solutions with Greater Speed, Adaptability, and Scale. The Department will deliver robust counter-unmanned systems at speed and scale, including by leveraging rapid acquisition approaches; prioritizing integrated, open, modular solutions; employing systems engineering and predictive analytics; reducing the cost imbalance between unmanned systems and countermeasures; expanded budget agility; increasing experimentation; creating conditions for rapid and realistic testing; and maximizing exportability, co-development, and co-production of capabilities with our closest allies and partners.' 'Develop & Design the Future Joint Force for Unmanned Systems-Driven Ways of War. The Department will make countering unmanned systems a key element of our thinking about future force development and design, including by pursuing changes to our force structure, employing our forces differently, and seeking technologies that could enable us to offset adversary advantages.' The full fact sheet can be seen below. DOD 'I think the real sort of emphasis of the strategy is to say, you know, as we're taking on the effect of unmanned systems, we need to think about this temporally,' a senior U.S. official told The War Zone and a small group of other media outlets ahead of today's announcement. 'So, in the near term, a lot of what we're doing is improving our defenses.' 'As we think about more advanced challenges, as we think about the more stressing cases we could face, we also are thinking in a strategy perspective of making sure that we're developing and designing our future forces to reduce vulnerabilities and increase resilience to threats,' they added. 'When we think about how we defend against this&#8230; it's really a layered defense with a variety of sensing - everything from RF to active and passive radars,' another senior U.S. official said during today's press call when asked for more details about existing counter-drone capabilities and future plans. 'And then &#8230; there's a variety of defeat systems, kinetic and non-kinetic.' 'When we talk about this threat, you have to consider &#8230; the size of the threat. A small UAS [uncrewed aerial system] is a little bit different threat than the larger UAS threats that you tend to see going on with events in Ukraine and Israel,' they added. 'So there's a different set of options that you have to have, but we are looking at the span of everything from non-kenetic to kinetic to new capabilities such as directed energy.' The senior U.S. official specifically highlighted Raytheon's Coyote, Anduril's Roadrunner, and systems that use BAE System's laser-guided 70mm Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II (APKWS) rockets as effectors as examples of current kinetic counter-drone capabilities. They also mentioned work to better optimize other existing weapon systems, such as radar-guided Hellfire missiles and traditional surface-to-air interceptors, for use against uncrewed aerial systems. Multiple branches of the U.S. military are known to be actively developing and working to field laser and high-power microwave-directed energy weapons as additional options for physically destroying drone threats. Non-kinetic defeat capabilities primarily consist of various electronic warfare systems. That individual also acknowledged that the counter-drone capabilities that can be employed in a conflict zone are very different from the ones that would be usable, at least under current authorities, domestically within the United States. The aforementioned drone incidents in the United Kingdom have highlighted how similar rules and regulations are at play when it comes to domestic drone defense in other countries. At a counter-drone demonstration event called Falcon Peak 2025 in October, U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) Deputy Test Director Jason Mayes explicitly told The War Zone and others that kinetic and directed energy capabilities are not currently on the table for defending military bases and other critical infrastructure within the U.S. homeland. A mix of often convoluted legal, regulatory, and other challenges are central to all of this, as you can read more about here. A system designed to detect drones via the radiofrequency signals they put out and hijack the control link between them and their operators on display at Falcon Peak 2025. Howard Altman 'The homeland is a very different environment in that we have a lot of hobbyist drones here that are no threat at all, that are sort of congesting the environment. At the same time, we have, from a statutory perspective and from an intelligence perspective, quite rightly, [a] more constrained environment in terms of our ability to act,' a third senior U.S. official on today's call elaborated. 'When we think about the [new counter-drone] strategy, &#8230; it's really trying to make sure that we are making a conscious effort to mitigate the threat in the homeland today, and the unique ways in which it manifests in the homeland, but also looking forward in time.' 'And so, we're doing things like making sure that our people have the right training. So it's not just about the equipment, but it's about are we organizing and training the way that we need to ensure that our commanders on the ground understand how to make a great risk calculus in the homeland for the unique risks that we have here,' they continued. 'We have a lot of installations that are in &#8230; areas where we have to be very careful about collateral effects. And do we have the organization that we need to be able to rapidly respond, given the capabilities that we're building today and [that] we'll continue to build to meet the threat of all for the future?' That official used the drone incursions over Langley Air Force Base last year as a specific of what the new counter-drone strategy, as well as NORTHCOM's new synchronizer role, are meant to address. An F-22 Raptor stealth fighter under a shelter on the flightline at Langley Air Force Base. USAF 'What we had before this was &#8230; a not necessarily in the operational chain ability to talk to each other, to find out who had what systems that might be able to be brought to bear,' they explained. 'And so I think that would be a huge &#8230; new organizational ability to be able to drive action.' 'As time moves on, we will have more standardized, coordinated education and training so that commanders will all have a baseline knowledge of what their authorities are and how they're able to engage,' they added. 'It's also going to mean that for facilities that may not currently be covered by 130(i), but are eligible, that we're going to have somebody who's really looking to make sure everyone's getting covered.' '130(i)' here refers to that subsection of Title 10 of the U.S. Code (10 USC 130i), which covers current authorities for the 'protection of certain facilities and assets from unmanned aircraft,' including through the use of kinetic and non-kinetic capabilities. It contains a number of specific stipulations and where and when those authorities can actually be employed, which you can read more about here. A full list of the kinds of 'action' authorized under 10 USC 130i. Cornell Law School The strategy notably does not explicitly call for an expansion to 130(i) or ask for any other new authorities. Members of Congress have been separately pushing to expand the authorities available to the U.S. military and other government agencies to tackle drone threats, particularly within the U.S. homeland. 'I think our view is that we are using those authorities to their fullest, but we're working to improve the collaboration that we have with our interagency partners,' one of the senior U.S. officials said today. 'That's an important part of how those authorities are [employed].' In the U.S. homeland context, even incidents that occur in relatively confined areas can easily span multiple federal, state, local, and other law enforcement jurisdictions outside of the purview of the Department of Defense. There is also the potential for an international component, especially in instances that involve the U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). As the recent incidents in the United Kingdom have underscored, drone threats to U.S. interests that are removed from traditional war zones exist well outside of the confines of the homeland, as well. A stock picture of a 'No Drone Zone' sign and other warnings along the perimeter of RAF Lakenheath, one of the bases in the United Kingdom that hosts U.S. forces and was recently the site of still unexplained drone incursions. Mark Kerrison/In Pictures via Getty Images Altogether, the new counter-drone strategy the Pentagon has rolled out today is an important acknowledgment of the growing uncrewed aerial threat ecosystem, especially as it exists outside of conflict zones. It lays out equally important steps forward for addressing these issues. At the same time, drone threats, including to the U.S. homeland, are not new and this is not the first time the U.S. government has laid new policies and/or broad strategies for addressing them. It is particularly glaring that the U.S. military is apparently taking key steps just now to better coordinate action within existing authorities. This is all despite years of increasingly worrisome incidents in and around the United States, many of which The War Zone has been the first to report on. As we have pointed out repeatedly in the past, the U.S. military was long slow on the uptake and continues to very much play catchup when it comes to addressing the growing threats posed by drones even on traditional battlefields. With the Pentagon's newest counter-drone strategy in hand, it will be more important now to see how its lines of effort are actually implemented.

Final Decision On Next Generation Air Dominance Fighter Punted To...	A decision on the future of the U.S. Air Force’s high-stakes Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative, which includes its crewed sixth-generation stealth combat jet, has been pushed to the incoming Trump administration. The move comes amid uncertainty about the Air Force’s ability to pay for NGAD, with a list of priority programs competing for funds, as well as its relevance in a future high-end combat scenario and who will be selected to build it, if it moves forward. Lockheed and Boeing are the two contractors still competing for the contract. In a statement today, the Air Force said: 'The Secretary of the Air Force will defer the Next Generation Air Dominance way-ahead decision to the next administration, while the Department of the Air Force continues its analysis and executes the necessary actions to ensure decision space remains intact for the NGAD program.' NGAD has been one of Kendall's major initiatives and his work prior to becoming secretary on a secret program that resulted in a flying demonstrator for what would morph into NGAD was key in moving the program forward. Inbox: USAF punts the NGAD decision to the next administration: as it 'continues its analysis and executes the necessary actions to ensure decision space remains intact for the NGAD program.'&mdash; Brian Everstine (@beverstine) December 5, 2024 The Air Force added that it is extending the current contracts for NGAD to 'further mature designs/systems while ensuring the industry teams remain intact.' The service requests that the industry competitors 'update their proposals to account for the delays resulting from the current pause (schedule/milestone update only).' As noted earlier, Boeing and Lockheed Martin are competing for the contract to build the NGAD combat jet, but neither company has formally confirmed that. On the other hand, Northrop Grumman announced it had dropped out of the running voluntarily last year. The Air Force has said in the past that it hopes to begin fielding these new 6th generation stealth fighters before 2030. Only last month, Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall had questioned the affordability of the service’s big-ticket aircraft programs, which as well as new crewed fighters include advanced aerial refueling tankers and highly autonomous Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones that are both linked directly to NGAD. Yet the crushing cost of rebuilding the USAF ICBM force is perhaps the largest driving financial factor that is impacting NGAD and other high-ticket programs. A rendering of a notional crewed sixth-generation stealth combat jet. Collins Aerospace In advance of today’s decision, the Air Force was already conducting a deep review of its NGAD plans, due to be completed before the end of the year, although Kendall has so far been keen to emphasize that the future of the sixth-generation fighter is secure, with the focus now being on how next generation tankers, CCAs and different NGAD fighters designs can best be used together, and in what kind of mix. 'We are actually looking hard at the combination of the Next Generation Air Dominance platform, the Increment Two uncrewed Collaborative Combat Aircraft, and the Next Generation Aerial Refueling System, all in an Agile Combat Employment context,' Kendall said back in November. 'Right now, given our commitments, our resources, and strategic priorities, it’s hard for me to see how we can afford any combination of those new designs,' Kendall added. Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall. U.S. Air Force photo by Andy Morataya Andy Morataya With cost being the prime concern behind the current NGAD review, it’s likely to again be at the forefront when the Trump administration determines the future of the program. Previously, it was assessed that each of NGAD’s sixth-generation crewed fighters would cost in the region of $300 million or more. Since then, however, Kendall has said he wants that to be reduced by two-thirds, bringing it more in line with a fifth-generation F-35 stealth fighter. It’s unclear how such a dramatic price drop could be achieved, but options might include reducing the number of missions the fighter takes on, as TWZ has discussed in the past. There are potentially more radical alternatives, as well. Earlier this year, an artificial intelligence-generated rendering of a notional light stealth fighter was included in a briefing by Chief of Staff of the Air Force Gen. David Allvin, the service’s top officer, something that was billed at the time as a thought exercise. An artificial intelligence-generated rendering of a notional light stealth fighter, shown during a presentation at the Global Air and Space Chiefs Conference earlier this year. YouTube screencap Allvin has since spoken about the possibility of the possibility of the B-21 Raider stealth bomber taking on something closer to an ‘air dominance’ role depending on the outcome of the NGAD combat jet review. This is a possibility TWZ has been discussing for years and the two programs — B-21 and NGAD — are already working loosely within each other's orbits. Then there is the option of tilting the NGAD program more in favor of uncrewed assets, chiefly the Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA), for which the NGAD fighter is expected to serve as a ‘quarterback.’ While far from clear how the CCAs will operate within the broader NGAD architecture, there are also questions about how many of the drones the Air Force plans to buy. Initially, the service said it wanted as many as 1,000 of those drones, and potentially more. Recently, the Air Force has talked about more modest numbers, broken down by increments, with Kendall saying that Increment 1 would involve around '100 [aircraft] on order or delivered' by the end of the decade. A model of Anduril’s Fury design, which it is now developing under Increment 1 of the CCA program. Jamie Hunter How many more drones will eventually be acquired under subsequent remains unknown, but this is something that will also be closely tied to the future of the crewed fighter component. Around 200 NGAD fighters were originally said to have been the target force size. At one point, NGAD’s status might have looked all but bulletproof, but developments in recent months have, for the first time, raised the very real prospect of the fighter component, at least, being significantly cut back or even canceled altogether. Once key player in the incoming Trump administration has already lambasted manned fighters as yesterday's weapon. Elon Musk, who has been a strong proponent of advanced uncrewed air combat systems, reently lambasted the F-35. It is unlikely he would support an even more ambitious fighter program. And although he is not formally put in a place to make such decisions, he certainly has the President's ear on all matters. Ultimately, it’s far from unprecedented that the future of a major defense program like NGAD will be pushed from one outgoing administration to an incoming one. At the same time, it’s been clear for a while now that the Air Force will have to make some very tough decisions about its priority programs as it continues to wrestle with fiscal realities.

Anti-Assad Forces’ Capture Of Strategic Hama A Critical Stop On R...	In the latest major development in the conflict in Syria, anti-regime rebels have taken control of the key central city of Hama. The city was seized despite a major regime counteroffensive and after 'fierce battles' between Assad's forces and rebels in northern Hama province. These were accompanied by 'joint Syrian-Russian' airstrikes, according to Syria’s state news agency Sana. In only a week, the rebels have taken huge swaths of territory in the northeast, leaving real questions about the future of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. His rule has previously been shored up by Russia, which is now very much concerned with the war in Ukraine, while further support has come from Iran and its top proxy, Hezbollah, which has been deeply degraded after a months-long direct fight with Israel. This equates to a vastly different set of circumstances for Assad than in the past, with external military resources being far more limited than they were the mid-to-late 2010s. The head of the Islamist rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, today published a video declaring that Hama had been captured. 'This victory will be without revenge and merciful,' al-Jolani said, in a message to the people of the city.

Videos posted to social media suggested that the insurgents had captured the military air base on the outskirts of Hama. Footage shows several MiG-23 Flogger fighters and a long-inactive Il-28 Beagle bomber.

However, as of yesterday, the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) information office confirmed that rebels had encircled Hama 'from three sides.' The government forces’ hold on the city was already looking flimsy, despite having launched a counteroffensive to retain control there. The SOHR added that the rebels had advanced to 'a distance of three to four kilometers' (1.9 to 2.5 miles) from the city by Wednesday. The result was that Syrian government forces were 'left with only one exit towards Homs to the south.'

These included 'dozens of trucks' loaded with tanks, weapons, ammunition, and soldiers. Meanwhile, 'regime forces and pro-government fighters led by Russian and Iranian officers' repelled an attack northwest of Hama. Finally, as rebels got closer to the city center, the Syrian Army admitted it had withdrawn, redeploying its forces 'to preserve the lives of civilians and not to involve the people of Hama city in these battles.'

In that year, there was a major anti-Assad uprising in the city, followed by fierce battles in which the opposition fighters were eventually defeated by regime forces. It is also the second major city to fall to the rebels since they launched their latest offensive, after Aleppo, Syria’s second biggest population center. At the same time, Hama is in a highly strategic location, a stronghold from which Assad’s forces are better able to defend the capital, Damascus, located to the south. Hama is situated on the main highway that runs down the western side of Syria toward the capital. A rebel-operated tank moves toward Hama city center, in Hama, Syria on December 4, 2024. Photo by Kasim Rammah/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu If the rebels can retain control of Hama, and cut west towards the coast, this threatens to cut off the main Russian bases in Syria — Khmeimim Air Base in Latakia and the sprawling naval facility in the port of Tartus — from the rest of the country. Were that to happen, it would seriously compromise Russia’s ability to support Assad militarily, as well as deprive it of its only such facilities in the Mediterranean. This is a possibility that TWZ has also recently explored. On the other hand, there are questions about the ability of the rebels to hold onto the territory that they have very rapidly taken and a race to Damascus may be their top objective. There have been reports from Syrian state mesia that the rebels are already using drones to attack targets in Damascus, including the Republican Palace, an Assad residence. HTS-led rebel forces are advancing through the desert in the countryside of Aleppo towards Hama.&mdash; NOELREPORTS (@noelreports.com) 2024-12-04T11:51:49.274Z Despite a reputation for being well organized, the speed of the advance means that HTS forces are being spread more thinly, leaving them more vulnerable to regime counterattacks. Beyond that, there is the question of the degree to which HTS will be able to reliably govern territory in its hands, especially over the longer term. Over and above this, there are broader questions about how other key strategic players will respond to the latest developments. As noted earlier, Assad’s grip on power has been reinforced heavily by Russia and Iran — including via the latter’s proxy, Hezbollah. Moscow, of course, is very much preoccupied with the conflict in Ukraine. Already, Russia is not able to offer Syria anywhere near the same kind of air support that it did earlier in the conflict, which it joined in 2015. The capacity to provide persistent airpower was a critical factor in turning the tide of the conflict in Assad's favor. A Russian Su-24M Fencer strike aircraft prepares to take off from Khmeimim Air Base in Latakia. Russian Ministry of Defense For its part, Hezbollah has been seriously degraded by Israeli actions in Lebanon, although Iran still has more capacity to bolster the Assad regime. But even Iran is in a more precarious position as it needs to stabilize Hezbollah while also providing for the Houthis' anti-ship campaign in and around the Red Sea. Meanwhile, Turkey, which has backed the anti-Assad opposition, also has a major stake in what happens next, with its primary aim being to bring down the Kurdish Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria, controlled by an offshoot of Ankara’s sworn enemy, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). Moscow says that it is in 'close contact' with both Ankara and Tehran over the conflict in Syria. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, added that Moscow was 'closely monitoring', events in Syria. 'Depending on the assessment of the situation, we will be able to talk about the degree of assistance that is needed by the Syrian authorities to cope with the militants and eliminate this threat,' he said.

Clearly, this gesture wasn’t enough, but it is a measure of the desperation of the regime and a suggestion that, for the first time in years, Assad’s grip on power across Syria might be slipping.

Revised Fold-Away Rotor Aircraft Concepts Emerge From Special Ope...	Bell has released a rendering showing updated design concepts for vertical takeoff and landing-capable crewed and uncrewed aircraft that feature proprotors that fold away during cruise. The company is working toward building a flying demonstrator using this technology as part of a program intended to present options for a potential future high-speed, runway-independent special operations airlifter. The new rendering accompanied an announcement from Bell yesterday about the completion of wind tunnel testing in support of its work under the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Speed and Runway Independent Technology (SPRINT) program. Bell is one of two companies currently working on designs as part of Phase 1B of SPRINT, the other being Aurora Flight Sciences, a Boeing subsidiary. Aurora's SPRINT concept uses multiple internally mounted lift fans for vertical flight, as you can read more about here. A wind tunnel model of one of Bell's fold-away rotor design concepts. Bell The wind tunnel 'test phase follows successful evaluation of the Stop/Fold rotor system using the Holloman High Speed Test Track (HHSTT) in New Mexico in 2023,' according to a Bell press release. 'Building upon the previous folding rotor testing, the wind tunnel program validated the stability and control of the aircraft through the rotor fold and unfold sequence in flight. Together, these two critical risk reduction tests prove the concept is ready to move ahead into a flight demonstration as part of the DARPA SPRINT program.' Bell first released renderings of two crewed design concepts, as well as an uncrewed one, featuring what it is now calling the 'Stop/Fold rotor system' back in 2021 in relation to U.S. Special Operations Command's High-Speed Vertical Take-Off and Landing (HSVTOL) project. SPRINT is directly tied to HSTVOL, which is focused primarily on meeting certain future U.S. Air Force special operations aviation requirements. Bell released this rendering showing design concept with fold-away rotor blades in 2021. Bell At its most basic, the Stop/Fold concept is intended to offer vertical takeoff and landing capability, as well as the ability to hover, but with a tilting rotor system that can be stowed in a lower-drag configuration to allow for higher-speed level flight. A separate traditional jet propulsion system provides forward thrust in the latter mode. For comparison, the V-22 Osprey, which Bell developed together with Boeing, has very large and draggy wingtip proprotors that are used for vertical and forward flight. The V-22 is part of a long history at Bell of work on tilting rotor concepts, which also now includes the V-280 Valor and the Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) for the U.S. Army that is derived from it. FLRAA is set to replace a significant portion of the Army's Black Hawk-series helicopters. The new Bell SPRINT rendering offers updated looks at the larger of the two crewed Stop/Fold rotor concepts and the uncrewed design. The smaller crewed design concept is not shown. When it comes to the uncrewed design concept, the latest Bell render shows a significant redesign of the side-mounted air intakes. There are two new two top-mounted intakes, which could provide valuable additional airflow while in the vertical flight mode or in other low-speed flight regimes. The overall shape of the central fuselage has been streamlined, as have the wingtip rotor pods. A close-up look at the new rendering of the uncrewed stop/fold rotor design concept. Bell A look at the older uncrewed fold-away rotor design concept from 2021. Bell The crewed design concepts shows signs of similar streamlining in the shape of its fuselage and wingtip rotor pods. The fairings over the proprotor hubs have notably grown in size. A top-mounted air intake seen in previous renders is now missing, suggesting there could be a new flush intake on top instead. The crewed design concept seen in the newest Bell render. Bell A render of the larger of the two crewed design concepts with fold-away rotors that was previously released. Bell Bell's latest SPRINT press release does not include any new details about expected flight performance or other capabilities of any of the Stop/Fold rotor concepts. In the past, the company has said the technology could be scaled to designs with gross weights anywhere from 4,000 to 100,000 pounds, and offer top speeds in the level flight mode of up to 400 knots. For comparison, Air Force Special Operations Command's (AFSOC) CV-22B version of the Osprey has a stated maximum gross weight of 60,500 pounds and a top speed of 280 knots. You can read more about what Bell has previously disclosed about the fold-away rotor concept in this War Zone feature. Air Force Special Operations Command CV-22 Ospreys. USAF U.S. Air Force CV-22B Ospreys. USAF Previous renderings have also pointed to the potential for Stop/Fold rotor designs to be used for mission sets well beyond special operations airlift. This could include combat search and rescue (CSAR), intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), air-to-air combat, and air-to-surface strike. An older rendering from Bell showing vertical takeoff and landing capable drones with fold-away rotor systems armed with compact air-to-air missiles. Bell Whether or not any of Bell's Stop/Fold rotor designs become a reality remains to be seen. Tiltrotor designs, in general, are complex and present considerable challenges even before fold-way rotors are added to the mix, as has been evidenced by continued troubles with the V-22. At the same time, Bell has made significant advances in relevant technologies, as demonstrated by the V-280. There is also no guarantee that any design that emerges from SPRINT or HSVTOL will enter operational service. As The War Zone has explored in great depth in the past, the U.S. special operations community has been at least exploring new vertical takeoff and landing capable transport aircraft and related designs for decades now without fielding any of them that we know of. 'There’s a lot of hard things,' Air Force Lt. Gen. Conley, head of AFSOC, said back in October while speaking broadly about ongoing work on SPRINT and HSVTOL. 'Some of it’s just the technological pieces of the engines and trying to get enough lift and enough size.' 'I think, conceptually as an Air Force, we struggle a little bit with how big is big enough … as you look at the developmental models, some of them are, you know, the size of a sedan. And then… another iteration would be the size of about a UH-60 [Black Hawk helicopter]. And then you get up to a little bigger … probably C-130 ‘lite,'' he added at the time. 'And I think as an Air Force that’s used to move in a lot of big things, and a lot of people, and a lot of pallets, and big amounts of cargo, there’s a little bit of a mental block there.' At the same time, there is a clear and growing interest in new runway-independent capabilities across the U.S. military. Runway-independent aircraft, or at least ones with more limited runway requirements, crewed and/or uncrewed, are increasingly seen as particularly key to success in a potential future high-end conflict against China in the Pacific. The designs being explored now under SPRINT offer attributes that could also have broader applicability in operations elsewhere globally. A rendering Aurora Flight Sciences released in October showing a fan-in-wing vertical take-off-and-landing capable transport aircraft based on technology it is developing under SPRINT. Aurora Flight Sciences 'I think the high speed/range, high-speed kind of lower profile ability to get in and out of places that don’t require long runways, I think that would be attractive to any combatant commander,' AFSOC's Conley had said in October. 'It’s certainly a capability we need in the Indo-Pacific, just because of the geography, regardless of an [specific] adversary.' Large established air bases would also be top targets for an opponent in any future major conflict, which could further limit access to traditional runways. There is a significant debate ongoing now about how and where the U.S. military should invest in new hardened infrastructure and other defenses to shield critical bases from attack going forward, as you can read more about here. Being able to operate from more locations, including far-flung ones closer to active combat areas, would help reduce vulnerability and increase overall flexibility, as well. Bell is certainly continuing to move forward with work on its Stop/Fold rotor system as one option for meeting growing demands for new vertical take-off and landing-capable special operations airlift and other runway-independent capabilities.

Russia Massing For Possible Cross-River Offensive In South Ukrain...	As Ukraine continues to lose territory in the eastern region of its country and struggles to hold on to the salient it’s carved out in Russia’s Kursk Oblast, it is facing increasing pressure in the south. 'Russian troops are constantly conducting assaults in the Kherson direction,' Vladislav Voloshin, a spokesman for Ukraine’s Southern Command, told the Suspline media outlet on Wednesday. 'Over the past day, there were seven of them. They tried to gain a foothold in the [Dnipro River] island zone.' BREAKING Russian forces prepare a massive river crossing near my hometown #Kherson, amassing 300 boats in a desperate bid to secure a foothold on strategic islands.

Intelligence warns of storm group training… pic.twitter.com/zKyzwiJDMV&mdash; Iuliia Mendel (@IuliiaMendel) December 4, 2024 Russia is increasing its efforts on the Dnipro to draw Ukrainian troops from other regions, the spokesman suggested. 'They have the goal of capturing a certain bridgehead, holding it, and bringing them there as much of our strength and means as possible,' Voloshin said. 'Russia wants to launch another offensive here,' Oleksandr Prokudin, head of the Kherson regional military administration, told the Financial Times. Russian forces, he added, had assembled '300 boats to cross the river' for that effort. The control map of the region has remained largely unchanged since Ukrainian forces recaptured Kherson City in November 2022. Ukraine has mounted furtive attempts at establishing a bridgehead in Kyrynky on the Russian side of the river. It has also tried to advance east from the mouth of the Dnipro by attacking through the Kinburn Spit. However, neither of these attempts succeeded and this part of the battlefield has seen no real territorial gains by either side. Ukraine's attacks across the Dnipro River have been bloody and futile. (Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky) Ahead of any potential river crossing, Russia has been softening the Ukrainian side with a massive drone barrage, according to the Financial Times. 'Since mid-July, Kherson and its neighboring villages along the western side of the Dnipro River have suffered more than 9,500 attacks with small drones, killing at least 37 people and injuring hundreds more,' according to Prokudin, regional prosecutors and police. Russia had deployed some of its ‘best drone units’ across the Dnipro River,' Prokudin told the Financial Times. From the opposite bank of the river bisecting Kherson Oblast, 'Russians were launching advanced drone models, refining combat techniques and training new operators for their intensifying invasion.' Ukrainian officials say Russia may be preparing an attack across the Dnipro River. (Google Earth image) This Russian push is happening ahead of the return of Donald Trump to the White House, Ukrainian officials suggest, according to Financial Times. Trump has repeatedly said he can end the war within his first 24 hours of taking office, however, he has presented no definitive plans. You can read more about this later in our story. 'Ukrainian officials suspect the assault is part of Russia’s plan to ratchet up pressure on Kyiv before Donald Trump returns to the White House, accelerating battlefield gains and preparing for a potential push across the Dnipro River,' the publication explained. The push to gain as much territory as possible ahead of a potential freeze of the front lines as part of a peace deal has been expected. How successful that would be is a big question given the challenges of fording a major river, especially with major bridges down. Russian forces experienced the difficulty of such maneuvers as they unsuccessfully tried to cross the Seym River in Kursk and were pushed back yesterday from an attempted advance across the Oskil River in Kharkiv Oblast. Vessels crossing the Dnirpo would be quickly targeted by drones, anti-tank guided missiles and direct-fire weapons. Artillery could also be a problem for those trying to cross. Any central massing of Russian troops can be hit with artillery, GMLRS rockets, and stand-off aviation strike munitions liked winged JDAM-ER GPS-guided glide bombs, GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs (SDB) and AASM-250 Hammer rocket-assisted bombs. So far, the Russian attempts to cross the Dnipro have failed, the Southern Command spokesman claimed. 'All these assaults end in nothing,' said Voloshin. 'They are all fruitless. The enemy only bears losses.' Russia, however, can afford more losses than Ukraine. Forcing Kyiv to redeploy troops or weapons to the once stable Kherson region would only add to its battlefield woes as its defenses in the east continue to degrade. The Latest Elsewhere on the battlefield, Russian forces continued gaining ground in eastern Ukraine, especially in the Donetsk region. Another area of growing concern for Ukraine is a potential new Russian push in the Donetsk-Zaporizhzhia border area. Here are some key takeaways from the latest assessment from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). Kursk Oblast: Ukrainian forces recently advanced in the main Ukrainian salient in Kursk Oblast on December 3. 'Geolocated footage published on December 2 indicates that Ukrainian forces recently advanced in southern Darino (southeast of Korenevo),' ISW stated. Kharkiv Oblast: Russian forces conducted offensive operations along the international border north of Kharkiv City towards Kozacha Lopan, north of Kharkiv City near Hlyboke, and northeast of Kharkiv City near Starytsya and Vovchansk on December 2 and 3 but did not make any confirmed advances. Donetsk Oblast: Russian forces continued offensive operations northeast of Siversk near Bilohorivka and in the Chasiv Yar direction on December 3 but did not make any confirmed advances. However, they recently advanced south of Toretsk and south of Pokrovsk. Donetsk-Zaporizhzhia border area: Russian forces recently advanced north of Velyka Novosilka in Donetsk. Geolocated footage published on December 3 'indicates that Russian forces recently advanced in northern Novyi Komar (north of Velyka Novosilka),' ISW stated. 'Russian advances into Novyi Komar support multiple courses of action (COAs) that ISW recently forecasted the Russian military command might pursue, including enveloping or bypassing Velyka Novosilka to interdict the T0518 Velyka Novosilka-Bahatyr highway and advance into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, and advancing to Andriivka (west of Kurakhove) from the south.' Zaporihzhzhia: Russian forces continued offensive operations near Robotyne, Novoandriivka (northwest of Robotyne), and Novodanylivka (north of Robotyne), on December 2 and 3 but did not make any advances.

On Tuesday, Vassily Nebenzia Russia's U.N. ambassador, accused Ukrainian intelligence of supporting anti-regime forces opposing Syria's Bashar Assad. He alleged that some fighters were openly displaying their connections. Anti-regime forces fighting with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) 'have not only not concealed the fact that they are supported by Ukraine, but they are also openly flaunting this,' Nebenzia told the Security Council. There was an 'identifiable trail' showing Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR) was 'providing weapons to fighters' in northwest Syria. 'Ukrainian military instructors from the GUR are present &#8230; training HTS fighters for combat operations,' including against Russian troops in Syria, Nebenzia alleged. Abu Bakr, leader of a Syrian opposition drone team, reached out to Ukrainian military intelligence for guidance, the Clah report claims. 'Ukrainians supplied 3D printing files for key components like bomb carriers, tails, and warheads. This allowed the opposition to produce, assemble, and adapt their drones independently.' He and another Syrian drone operator stated that GUR is providing only training and guidance in conducting drone operations.

'Rutte emphasized that deepening ties between U.S. adversaries endangered America as he made a pitch to the president-elect to stick with NATO and continue to support Ukraine,' the publication reported. Rutte noted the risks from Russia supplying missile technology to North Korea and cash to Iran. In an apparent reference to Taiwan, he said that Chinese President Xi Jinping 'might get thoughts about something else in the future if there is not a good deal [for Ukraine].' 'We cannot have a situation where we have [North Korean leader] Kim Jong Un and the Russian leader and Xi Jinping and Iran high-fiving because we came to a deal which is not good for Ukraine, because long-term that will be a dire security threat not only to Europe but also to the U.S.,' Rutte told the FT in his first interview as head of the western military alliance.

According to ex-Wagner commander and milblogger Andrey Medvedev, an officer serving with the Russian Army's Central Military district complained about having to turn untrained troops into front-line motorized assault units. 'Our division command decided to take extreme measures that defy common sense,' the officer wrote. 'Namely, to form assault groups and reserves from among specialists from other units that do not belong to motorized rifle and assault units It is impossible to retrain personnel as stormtroopers at a training ground in a week, with subsequent use of hastily formed units, and to liberate (occupy) strategically important heights in the area of ​​responsibility.' 4/ 'It is impossible to retrain personnel as stormtroopers at a training ground in a week, with subsequent use of hastily formed units, and to liberate (occupy) strategically important heights in the area of ​​responsibility.'&mdash; ChrisO_wiki (@ChrisO_wiki) December 2, 2024 As part of a major effort to stop Ukraine's failed 2023 counteroffensive, the Russians built a massive series of trenches, bunkers, and mine fields around the country, especially in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. It was known as the Surovikin Line and named for Russian Gen. Sergei Surovikin, who developed that defensive plan. He was since fired after news broke that he was aware of the late Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin’s putative pitch ahead of time.

The Russian Astra news channel posted a video it claimed showed the moment of impact of an attack at or near the base. It looks like it came from a security camera and shows a bright flash at the end, making it hard to confirm what was actually seen. Ryazan Governor Pavel Malkov claimed on Telegram that a drone was downed over the region by Russian defense forces. 'At the crash site of the downed UAV in the Korablinsky district, windows in four nearby houses were damaged,' he stated. 'There were no casualties.' The Korablinsky district lies roughly 60 kilometers (around 40 miles) south of the regional center, Ryazan, the Kyiv Independent noted. The Dyagilevo airbase 'reportedly hosts the 43rd Center for Combat Training with Tu-22M3, Tu-95MS, Tu-134UBL, and An-26 aircraft, as well as Il-78 tanker planes and a repair plant,' the publication explained. A Ukrainian drone is said to have struck the airbase in December 2022, killing and injuring several soldiers. The military facility was allegedly targeted again in July 2024.

Our Best Look At Russia’s Shadowy Zircon Hypersonic Missile	A recent drill by the Russian Armed Forces in the Mediterranean has provided us with a more detailed view of the shadowy Zircon hypersonic missile, a weapon that has only been glimpsed in the past and shown up in the form of fragments after being combat tested in Ukraine. The maneuvers come as Russia’s position in Syria — home to its two major Mediterranean bases — increasingly looks to be under threat, as rebels continue their rapid advance south, threatening the rule of Bashar al-Assad, a key Kremlin ally. You can read more about the potential implications for Russia here.

From several different angles, the missile is seen emerging from the 3S14 vertical launch system (VLS) on the deck of a Russian Navy Project 22350 Admiral Gorshkov class frigate. The missile is seen pulling up, stabilized by vectoring rockets, before continuing on a vertical trajectory, at which point the video ends. Two views show the launch of a Zircon missile from the latest video. Russian Ministry of Defense capture Russian Ministry of Defense capture According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, the live-fire exercise took place in the eastern Mediterranean yesterday and involved sea-based and air-launched missiles. The frigates Admiral Gorshkov and Admiral Golovko are said to have fired Zirkon missiles, while the diesel-electric submarine Novorossiysk launched a Kalibr subsonic cruise missile. Meanwhile, on the Syrian coast, a Bastion coastal defense system launched an Oniks supersonic cruise missile. Another video showed a Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile being prepared under a MiG-31I fighter, although it’s unclear if this missile was also launched. Undoubtedly, various U.S. and NATO assets will also have been closely monitoring this exercise and likely yielding much new high-quality intelligence on Zircon and other systems.

We have seen an official video purporting to show a Zircon launch from close quarters before, but on that occasion, it was very difficult to see any details of the missile. This even led to some debate around whether that earlier video — released in October 2020 — may have been edited by splicing together a combination of footage showing one or more other weapons, and not just the Zircon. The 2020 video claimed to show the first test launch of the Zircon against a naval target, from the Gorshkov. A still from Russian Ministry of Defense footage shows a missile fired from the 16-cell 3S14 vertical launch system on the foredeck of the frigate Admiral Gorshkov, underway in the White Sea, in October 2020. This was the first official imagery purporting to show Zircon. Russian Ministry of Defense capture A Russian Ministry of Defense video that claims to show the Zircon test in the White Sea on October 6, 2020: Another video, released by the Russian Ministry of Defense in May 2022, is said to show the Gorshkov launching a Zircon, although the missile is seen only at a distance with no details visible: Comparing the new video with the one from 2020, it seems we are looking at the same missile, but there are still some questions about how it actually operates. Interestingly, much of the speculation around the Zircon back in 2020 focused on its potential relationship to one particular older design, the Oniks supersonic missile, which can also be fired from the 3S14 VLS. Seen from the bow of the warship, the Zircon climbs away after launch. Russian Ministry of Defense capture Another view of the Zircon after launch during a live-fire exercise yesterday. Russian Ministry of Defense capture The Oniks has also been used against land targets in Ukraine and in past fighting in Syria, and the Zircon is similarly billed as a dual-use weapon. In the past, the Russian Ministry of Defense has claimed that the Zircon has reached a speed 'more than Mach 8' in tests, while Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the weapon has a top speed of around Mach 9 and a range of approximately 620 miles. If true, that would put it firmly in the hypersonic category. In contrast, the Oniks flies at a maximum speed of up to Mach 2.2, powered by a liquid-fuel ramjet motor. Its maximum range is said to be 180 miles, although this is greatly reduced when flying a low-altitude profile. Mockup of a Yakhont missile (the export version of the Onyx). Boevaya mashina/Wikimedia Commons Boevaya_mashina The Zircon looks very different from the ‘waverider’-type hypersonic missile that the Russian media has used to illustrate it in the past. As in the U.S. Air Force’s experimental X-51 Waverider, this type of missile uses supersonic shockwaves to maintain the flight vehicle’s lift and stability. It would typically use a conventional rocket motor to bring it to the required speed and altitude, before an air-breathing high-speed engine, such as a scramjet, takes over. One of a number of graphics circulating on the internet purporting to show the Zircon. via AINOnline In January 2023, the Russian Ministry of Defense said that the Gorshkov had set out on a deployment armed, for the first time, with Zircon missiles, as you can read about here. Officials in Russia have said in the past that they expect a number of other types of ships and submarines, including the Russian Navy’s advanced and extremely quiet nuclear-powered Yasen and Yasen-M class submarines, to be able to employ Zircon in the future. In October 2021, Russia claimed that it had successfully test-launched the Zircon from a submarine for the first time, as you can read about here. However, the apparent combat debut of the Zircon appears to have made use of a ground-based launcher of some kind. In February this year, Ukrainian scientists claimed that Russia had, for the first time, used the Zircon in attacks on at least one target in Ukraine. Alongside these claims, the scientists showed a video of the alleged Zircon wreckage — 'fragments of the engine and steering mechanisms [with] specific markings.' Various alleged fragments of a Zircon missile were presented by the Kyiv Scientific-Research Institute for Forensic Examinations. via X Most interestingly, the Kyiv Scientific-Research Institute for Forensic Examinations also provided a line drawing of a supposed Zircon missile that looks very different from previous renderings. Instead of a waverider-type design, the drawing showed a missile with more in common with a very high-speed ramjet-powered design. The two-stage weapon features a cap over the nose that likely conceals an annular air intake, which feeds the main engine once the first-stage booster falls away. A similar approach was used in the Boeing HyFly, a demonstrator for a hypersonic ramjet-powered cruise missile. This would also seem to broadly tally with the video of the Zircon from yesterday’s exercise in the Mediterranean. A presumed mockup of the Boeing HyFly hypersonic vehicle at the TSNII VVKO, a secretive Russian military research facility. Zvezda TV The apparent evidence from Ukraine, combined with the latest video of the Zircon also point to a missile that with similar overall dimensions to the Oniks, and, most likely, an annular air intake. Similarity with the Oniks would also make it easier to fire the Zircon from the same type of ground launcher, which appears to have been the case when it was used against Ukraine. In the video we see the missile bulbous nose cap that will separate as it transitions to forward sustained flight. A close-up of the Zircon from the latest video shows the distinctive nose cap, apparently concealing an annular intake. Russian Ministry of Defense capture The U.K. Ministry of Defense assessed that, when used against Ukraine, the Zircon was likely fired from the land-based Bastion coastal defense system, which normally fires Oniks missiles. 'It is likely the Russians are testing a newly operational weapon system in a live conflict environment to provide assurance and demonstrate capability,' the U.K. Ministry of Defense added. In many ways, the Zircon remains an enigmatic weapon, with precise details of its operating principle and performance still unconfirmed. The operational status of the missile is also somewhat unclear, although Russia does now seem to be more willing to show the Zircon in greater detail than was the case in the past.

Mysterious Object Appears At Remote Chinese Airfield Linked To Sp...	Recent satellite imagery shows a curious white-colored object at the end of the runway at a remote airstrip in northwestern China. The airfield, which is situated near the Lop Nur nuclear test site, has been tied to Chinese reusable space plane developments in the past. A satellite image taken on November 29 that The War Zone obtained from Planet Labs shows the white-colored object, along with several smaller ones, which look to be vehicles and support equipment, at the southwestern end of the desert airstrip's runway. The runway itself is over 16,400 feet in total length, or more than 3 miles long, which makes it one of the longest anywhere in the world. A row of vehicles is also visible at the facility's main apron, which has been significantly expanded in recent years, including with the addition of a new large hangar.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION What the larger object on the runway might be, or even its exact shape, is unclear. Though it looks broadly cylindrical from above, its body is also seen casting a distinctly wedge-shaped shadow. Some obscuration of markings on the runway may point to the presence of short stubby wings at one end. It has an overall length of around 32 feet.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION As already noted, the remote Chinese airfield and its extremely long runway have previously been linked to work on reusable spaceplanes with potential military applications, including ones believed to be roughly akin in form and function to the X-37B. The War Zone's first report on this facility came after it appeared that one of these crafted touched down there following the end of a mission in space in September 2020. The recently observed object is comparable length-wise to the U.S. Space Force's two secretive X-37B mini-shuttles (just over 29 feet long), though that alone does not mean there is a relationship between the two.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Chinese authorities did announce the return to Earth of a 'reusable experimental spacecraft' back on September 6 following 268 days in orbit, but there are no indications that what is seen in the November 29 satellite image is in any way directly related. Reusable spaceplanes do sit on the runway for at least some amount of time after they land for post-mission servicing, including the removal of any remaining fuels or other payloads, and other preparation for relocation to a more secure location. However, those are not processes that take days, let alone weeks or months, to complete. The object's apparent orientation with its rear toward the end of the runway would not point to a recovery, either. At the same time, if the object at the end of the runway is indeed spaceplane-related, it could reflect a general need for personnel at the remote airfield to train for ground-handling activities. It also could be some other kind of test article. It is also worth noting here that Felix Schöfbänker, an amateur Australian space watcher, did capture imagery of what is believed to be the spaceplane that touched back down in September while it was still in orbit. From what is visible, it has been suggested that the craft might have a delta-wing planform, which could be in line with the 'wings' on the object seen in the November 29 image of the airstrip near Lop Nur.

In 2007, pictures did emerge that showed one such design called Shenlong (meaning Divine Dragon), or a related test article, under the fuselage of a People's Liberation Army (PLA) H-6 bomber. We also got a look at a full-size model of another reusable mini-shuttle design, called Haolong, back in October around this year's Zhuhai Airshow. State-run Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) subsidiary Chengdu is developing Haolong officially as an option for resupplying the country's Tiangong space station.

A remote facility with a runway this long would be a useful location for a wide array of aerospace-related testing activities away from prying eyes. Whatever the object might have been, it does not appear to be related to a warning notice to aviators that emerged at around the same time. A series of posts from @thenewarea51 on X called our attention to the so-called Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM), which covered an area further to the southwest that contains multiple large-scale targets with the outlines of warships. This includes one that is clearly meant to represent the U.S. Navy's newest supercarrier USS Gerald R. Ford.

The PLA has been very actively developing and fielding increasingly longer-range anti-ship capabilities, including longer-range ballistic missiles capable of hitting moving vessels, and the kill webs required to execute those strikes, as part of a broader anti-access/area-denial strategy. A before and after look at the Arleigh Burke class destroyer-shaped target that was hit around the time the NOTAM was active. PHOTO © 2024 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Regardless, the PLA does also have a clear interest in reusable spaceplanes, which could provide valuable platforms for the rapid deployment of relatively small satellites and other payloads into space. They could also act as space-based intelligence-gathering assets or even anti-satellite weapons, areas that China's armed forces have also been investing in heavily in recent years. With all this in mind, the rare appearance of a curious object, whatever it might be, on the huge runway at the remote airstrip near Lop Nur is notable.

F-35A’s 25mm Gun Still Needs Tests To Verify It Works	The Pentagon says more testing is required to demonstrate that the 25mm automatic cannon mounted internally on the F-35A variant of the Joint Strike Fighter is indeed now an effective weapon. Various software and hardware issues had long left the stealthy jets unable to shoot straight, but fixes intended to resolve them have been implemented. New questions about the actual effectiveness of the F-35A's internal gun emerged last month after the Project on Government Oversight (POGO), an independent nonprofit, published a heavily redacted declassified copy of a report on the Joint Strike Fighter program from the Pentagon's Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E). POGO obtained the document, which is dated February 2024, via the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and provided its own analysis of the contents. The report also underscored long-standing maintenance and logistics challenges that have contributed to historically low readiness rates across all variants of the F-35 and that could have worrisome impacts on future combat operations. The War Zone has explored those issues and their broader ramifications in detail in a past feature. 'The F-35 lethality assessment suffered from the inability of the F-35's gun to hit the targets because of design and installation issues,' according to an unredacted section of the February 2024 DOT&E report that POGO obtained. For context, each F-35A has a four-barrelled 25mm Gatling-type cannon, designated the GAU-22/A, mounted internally in a space above the aircraft’s left engine intake. The gun has a rate of fire of 3,300 rounds per minute and feeds from a 180-round magazine. A flush-mounted door opens when the gun is fired and closes when it stops to maintain the jet's stealth signature. The F-35B and C variants do not have internal guns, but can carry GPU-9/A gun pods that contain a GAU-22/A and 220 rounds of ammunition. It is no secret that problems tied to how certain symbology was presented to pilots through their helmet-mounted displays (HMD) had prevented all three F-35 variants from employing their guns effectively in the past. F-35s lack a traditional heads-up display (HUD) in their cockpits. The information a pilot would typically get from a HUD is instead projected onto the visor of their helmet. The design of the internal mount for the GAU-22/A on the A version of the F-35 was also found years ago to have been so badly misaligned that it not only negatively impacted accuracy, but also caused physical damage to the aircraft from firing the gun. Additional concerns about cracking on the F-35A as a result of gun use have also surfaced in recent years. You can read more about the F-35's gun-related woes in detail here. 'After working with the Air Force and our industry partners we can report that the gun has been improved and is effective,' Russ Goemaere, a spokesperson for the F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO), had told The War Zone in March of this year. 'We continue to work with industry, the Services, and our international partners for further improvements and to maximize effectiveness and lethality at the tactical/operational level.' 'The F-35 JPO made changes to hardware and software resulting in improved and effective gun operations,' Goemaere told The War Zone again last month in response to questions about the contents of the February 2024 DOT&E report. 'Operational testing of the F-35A/B/C gun systems occurred during F-35 Initial Operational Test and Evaluation [IOT&E]. The majority of this testing was in 2018 and 2019,' a U.S. defense official also told The War Zone in response to a question about when the 'F-35 lethality assessment' referred to in the DOT&E report actually occurred. 'Operational testing of the F-35A/B/C gun systems with the latest iteration of fixes is planned, but has not occurred. DOT&E does not yet have data or reports that would alter the observations in the IOT&E report,' that same U.S. defense official added when asked about whether DOT&E currently agrees with the F-35 JPO's current assessment of the effectiveness of the F-35A's gun. The effectiveness of the F-35A's internally mounted gun has been a particular talking point with regard to the U.S. Air Force's ongoing plan to retire the venerable A-10 Warthog ground attack jet and its famed 30mm GAU-8/A Avenger cannon. The A variant of the Joint Strike Fighter has been presented as the primary replacement aircraft. A separate and equally heavily redacted DOT&E report regarding still highly controversial comparison testing of the F-35A and the A-10C that occurred between 2018 and 2019 did refer to a need to 'fix the F-35A gun,' but any further context was censored. POGO also obtained that report, which is dated Febraury 2022 and had been effectively buried, via FOIA and subsequent litigation, and published it last year. An A-10 fires its GAU-8/A Avenger cannon. USAF An A-10 Warthog firing its iconic GAU-8/A Avenger cannon. USAF Effective or not, the GAU-22/A inside the F-35A with its 180 rounds of ammunition (which equates to just over three seconds of total firing time) cannot be directly compared in any way to the A-10's legendarily huge GAU-8/A, which feeds from a 1,174-round magazine. The 30mm rounds the GAU-8/A fires are much larger than the 25mm ones that the GAU-22/A spits out, too. It is worth noting that the Avenger caused serious problems during the initial development fielding of the A-10, as you can learn more about here and in the video below. The F-35A's ammunition load for its gun is small even in comparison to that of other stealthy and non-stealthy jets in U.S. service today. The M61 Vulcan cannons on U.S. Air Force F-16C Vipers and F-22 Raptors, for instance, have 500 and 480 rounds of 20mm ammunition to go along with them, respectively. The GAU-22/A's 25mm rounds are bigger than the 20mm shells that M61s fire. Questions have also been raised about the utility of available ammunition for the GAU-22/A. The primary operational round that all F-35s fire from their guns, whether they be internally mounted or in pods, is the PGU-48/B, referred to as a Frangible Armor Piercing (FAP) type. It is a kinetic round designed to damage/destroy targets through force of impact. The 'frangible' tungsten penetrator inside also breaks up after hitting its mark to create deadly shrapnel. Despite its lack of explosive or incendiary elements, the PGU-48/B is said to be effective against aircraft, as well as armored vehicles and soft-skinned ground targets, according to the manufacturer, Germany's Rheinmetall. What demonstrated effects the rounds may have against enemy personnel are unclear. Rheinmetall A 2014 briefing slide providing a general overview of the PGU-48/B and showing a cutaway of one of the cartridges. Rheinmetall At around $131 dollars per round, the PGU-48/Bs are also expensive. The price point for a single 20mm PGU-28A/B semi-armor-piercing high-explosive incendiary cartridge, the main ammunition type for Vulcan cannons in Air Force jets, is around $34. There remains a possibility that other 25mm ammunition types, such as high explosive and/or incendiary rounds, could be certified for use in the GAU-22/A in the future. The close air support mission, even when performed by the A-10, is ever more about the employment of precision-guided munitions rather than strafing runs. The Air Force's argument for retiring the Warthogs, a process that is now very much underway and looks set to be completed by the end of the decade if not well before then, has been centered on this reality. A-10s are still flying combat missions, including just this week in Syria. At the same time, a working gun can still be an important tool for tactical aircraft to have in various circumstances. An accurate aerial gun offers the ability to provide even more focused fire on a target, and even more limited risk of collateral damage than most precision munitions, which can be particularly useful for supporting ground forces in dense urban environments. In air-to-air combat, the expectation is that traditional dogfights will become increasingly uncommon, especially for stealthy jets like the F-35 with its still-growing array of other advanced capacities, At the same time, visual-range aerial engagements could still occur in future conflicts, including during lower-end missions in dense airspace with tight rules of engagement or in high-end fights with large volumes of enemy and friendly forces operating in relatively constrained battlespaces. Guns continue to provide immediate backup firepower for tactical jets should they run out of other munitions, in general. This was just recently highlighted by new details about the U.S. military's contribution to the defense of Israel against incoming Iranian threats back in April. At least one Air Force F-15E Strike Eagle crew switched to their Vulcan cannon after they ran out of missiles while swatting down drones, though they were unable to score any gun kills. In the meantime, DOT&E says it is still waiting to see the data showing that F-35A pilots can effectively do the same if necessary.

Russia’s Advanced Podlet-1K Radar Captured By Anti-Assad Forces I...	An advanced Russian air defense radar system is among the equipment captured by anti-regime forces in Syria as they continue their rapid push south, a development that has the potential for serious repercussions in the wider region. The Podlet-K1 radar system, also known by the designation 48Ya6-K1, is one of the more modern pieces of equipment in the Russian inventory, has been employed in the war in Ukraine, and would be a significant intelligence windfall if it were to possibly find its way into Western hands. Wow. Rebels also captured the antenna vehicle of the advanced Russian 48Ya6-K1 'Podlet-K1' multipurpose mobile three-coordinate S-Band radar system, specifically designed to detect air targets at low and extremely low altitudes.Operates with S-300/400 etc, very capable. pic.twitter.com/etjXgaBVmb&mdash; Cᴀʟɪʙʀᴇ Oʙsᴄᴜʀᴀ (@CalibreObscura) December 4, 2024 A photo of the captured Podlet-K1, which is mounted on a KamAZ-6350 8×8 truck chassis, appeared recently on social media, although when it was taken remains unclear. Furthermore, there’s no confirmation of its exact location, although some have suggested that it was captured during fighting around the city of Hama, in west-central Syria.

This has a long and involved history in the Syrian conflict and is spearheading the current assault toward the south. The photo shows the vehicle carrying the radar antenna in its lowered position. The complete system also includes another two trucks — an operator control station, and an energy support vehicle — which may or may not also now be in rebel hands. In promotional material, the Podlet-K1 is described as being optimized to detect aerial targets flying at low and very low altitudes. It does this using a phased-array radar antenna, operating in the S-band and reportedly able to track up to 200 targets simultaneously. The main antenna is complemented by a pair of other radars used for identification friend or foe (IFF) functions. Introduced to service around 2018, the Podlet-K1 can be used alongside the S-300PMU-2 and S-400 long-range surface-to-air missile systems, complementing their own detection radars, and other sensors. The reported maximum detection range of the Podlet-K1 is 200-300 kilometers (124-186 miles), although this would vary greatly in real-world situations, depending on many factors, including target type, altitude, and more. According to Ukrainian media reports, the complete system is worth around $5 million. The three vehicles that comprise the 48Ya6-K1 Podlet-K1 system. The radar vehicle is nearest the camera, with the antenna lowered for transport. Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation Timofey_Nikishin_nikisht It’s not clear if the Podlet-K1 was formally part of the Syrian Armed Forces, or if it belonged to a Russian unit operating in the country, although Syrian and Russian air defenses are already closely aligned in some respects. There are unconfirmed reports it was captured from the Syrian 25th Special Forces Division, although that doesn’t preclude it from being a Russian-operated system co-located with this unit. Already, Syrian rebels have captured significant quantities of military equipment as they advance south, including tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, rocket launchers, and even aircraft.

The Podlet-K1 would seem to be the most interesting item identified so far, however, on account of its modernity and the fact that, as far as we know, Ukraine has not managed to capture an intact one from Russian forces fighting there. At least two Podlet-K1 systems, or parts of them, have been destroyed by Ukrainian forces. One of these was within Russian territory when it was hit, by a long-range drone strike in September of this year. Before that, as TWZ reported in July of 2022, another Podlet-K1 was apparently targeted by an M31A1 guided multiple-launch rocket system (GMLRS) in the Kherson region of Ukraine. The war in Ukraine has already provided plenty of examples of high-end Russian military equipment being captured and then being subject to extensive analysis. This has even included some items being transported to the United States for a technical evaluation. Equipment captured in Ukraine has, in particular, provided insights into Russian electronic warfare capabilities, including containerized components of vehicle-borne systems, among them signals intelligence (SIGINT) systems, as well as airborne jamming pods. Like these, the Podlet-K1 would be of significant interest to military intelligence agencies, especially those of the United States and NATO, providing insight into the capabilities of one of Russia’s more modern air defense radars. As an example of FME of Russian equipment, in 2018, the U.S. Army reportedly took delivery of a Ukrainian 36D6M1-1 air defense radar, an example of which is seen here and that is associated with the S-300 air defense system. UKROBORONPROM Knowledge of the Russian military’s ability to detect low-flying aerial targets over the battlefield — including drones and cruise missiles, but also helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft — would be especially useful when it comes to fielding countermeasures. Having insight into the workings of the Podlet-K1 could allow the West to develop means not only of blunting its capabilities but also of feeding it false signals and devising tactics to exploit its weaknesses, both in terms of operations and in the cyber realm. While the United States is well known for its extensive so-called foreign materiel exploitation (FME) programs, dating back to the earliest years of the Cold War, actually getting the Podlet-K1 into the hands of U.S. or other NATO analysts is another matter. The situation on the ground in Syria is confused and it’s possible that the Podlet-K1 is no longer in anti-Assad forces' hands, although we have seen no proof of that being the case. There is also a possibility that it might have been destroyed by now, perhaps even being targeted by a Russian airstrike to prevent it from yielding any sensitive information. Bringing Russian-made equipment out of an active war zone outside of Ukraine is not impossible, however. In this case, one possible route out of Syria might involve the system being handed over via Turkish intelligence. Back in June 2020, the U.S. military reportedly spirited a Russian-made Pantsir-S1 out of Libya, after it was captured from forces aligned with rogue general Khalifa Haftar. Turkey was also involved here as an intermediary. The operation was ostensibly aimed at preventing the system from falling into the hands of any number of militant and terrorist groups in that country, but there would also be clear intelligence benefits, too, as you can read about here. A Pantsir-S1 air defense system captured from forces aligned with Khalifa Haftar at Al Watiya Air Base, Libya, in May 2020. via X Reportedly, a U.S. Air Force C-17A Globemaster III transport aircraft flew into Zuwarah International Airport, to the west of Tripoli, picked up the Pantsir-S1, and then flew it to Ramstein Air Base in Germany. Whatever happens next with the captured Podlet-K1 vehicle, its fate is emblematic of the dramatic progress made by the Syrian rebels in a short amount of time. The vehicle’s loss is symptomatic of the regime forces — and their Russian backers — having been caught by surprise. As long as the rebel push continues, they are likely to get their hands on more equipment, and the capture of further high-end Russian items shouldn’t be ruled out.

The Navy’s Amphibious Fleet Is In Really Bad Shape	The Navy’s amphibious fleet is in such a sorry state that half of the ships are declared to be in 'poor condition' and not on track to serve for the entirety of their service lives. In addition, the sea service will struggle to maintain a fleet of at least 31 amphibs into the 2030s as required by law. Those are some of the grim findings of a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on the state of the Navy’s 32 amphibious assault ships (LHD/LHA), dock landing ships (LSD) and amphibious transport docks, (LPD), which come together to form Amphibious Ready Groups (ARG) that transport Marines, their aircraft and other vehicles across the seas. Without these ships, which are based in San Diego, Little Creek, Virginia, and Sasebo, Japan, Marines can struggle to deploy or train, and Tuesday’s GAO report lays out how bad the fleet has gotten, and how hard it will be to get it back on a proper course. Home bases for the U.S. Navy's amphibious fleet. (GAO) The GAO highlights a host of longstanding problems that have afflicted the entire fleet to varying degrees, including chronic maintenance delays, competing budget priorities, ill-planned early-retirement efforts that went forward without required congressional approval, scarce spare parts, shoddy contractor oversight and other issues. But the report does not address the Marine Corps’ original Force Design 2030 vision, which involved sweeping changes to the Corps to ready Marines for a fight in the Pacific. Under the original proposed doctrine, far less emphasis would be placed on large-scale beach landings centered around a few dozen amphibious ships and more would be put into Marines operating in smaller groups, and possibly from smaller amphibious vessels, distributed across a vast battle space. This put the future of traditional amphibs in doubt, but that vision has since been watered down due to competing interests, including the demands of Congress, and the amphibious assault vessels have remained a priority for the Navy and the USMC. (U.S Marine Corps) Two-high profile amphib failures this year showcased the real-world consequences of the fleet’s ongoing issues. The Boxer ARG, composed of USS Boxer (LHD-4), USS Somerset (LPD-25) and USS Harpers Ferry (LSD-49), all experienced maintenance delays and were unable to deploy as planned in September 2023. Boxer couldn’t go until April 2024 and had to turn around and return to San Diego just days into its Pacific cruise due to a starboard rudder issue. After that, Boxer didn’t resume its deployment until July 2024, 10 months after it was supposed to head out. ARG leaders later highlighted the training they were still able to do on deployment, but the GAO notes that, with Boxer unavailable, 'the Marine Corps was unable to deploy the full 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit and lacked the capabilities provided by F-35 fighter aircraft.' The USS America (LHA-6) ARG was unable to patrol as a full group this year due to a lack of the three ships required for a full ARG, resulting in the Navy and Marine Corps missing exercises and creating a presence gap in the group’s assigned area of responsibility, the report states. A U.S. Marine Corps F-35B stealth fighter jet prepares to land aboard the amphibious assault ship USS America (LHA-6). Seaman Apprentice Jeadan Andre The Navy has also been down an additional amphib since a 2020 port fire, and bungled response, destroyed the USS Bonhomme Richard (LHD-6). Such readiness issues are not new in the fleet, according to the GAO, which cites Marine Corps records showing that the Navy had to extend 71 percent of its amphib depot maintenance periods from 2010 to 2021, and that this cost the Marines nearly 29 years in lost training and deployment time. Marine Corps leaders have diplomatically expressed frustration with the Navy’s inability to get its amphib house in order, even as the two services continue to hammer out an amphibious fleet plan for the future that will help mitigate such shortcomings. Then-Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps Gen. Eric Smith told reporters in July 2023 that four of the last five ARG deployments had failed to go on time. 'Did they have their full amount of training days? Did they have their full integration period? And did they deploy together as an ARG-MEU? If they couldn’t do that [then] we have a readiness problem,' Smith, who is now the Marine Corps commandant, told Breaking Defense’s Justin Katz. Navy Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti said at an event at the Stimson Center think tank Tuesday that the Navy was eventually able to deploy the Boxer, and that the deployment was extended so that the Marines could get through their training requirements. Navy Chief of Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti, left, and Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Eric Smith. (U.S. Marine Corps) Staff Sgt. Kelsey Dornfeld She said the services are working to understand how they can work through maintenance challenges without impeding Marine training or certifications, and that the Navy has funded the purchase of new amphibs. 'We’re committed, locked shields, in everything we do,' she said, adding that such ships are 'a capability we need all around the world, every single day.' Two Navy reviews commenced this spring and in 2023, when Franchetti was vice chief of naval operations, seeking to get a full picture of 'the wide range of problems affecting readiness in the amphibious fleet,' but the GAO notes that the sea service 'has made little progress in addressing these challenges.' Ship age and other factors means the Navy will have a hard time meeting its statutory requirement to have at least 31 amphibs going forward, the GAO report states. The service currently has 32 amphibs in its fleet and is mulling service-life extensions to keep the fleet at 31 vessels, but the GAO found that such work will cost up to $1 billion a ship, and that six ships will need such extensions in the next 30 years 'amid rising ship construction costs and maintenance backlogs.' The GAO also notes that the Navy maintaining at least 31 amphibs does not mean these ships are good to deploy or train: 'In some cases, ships within the amphibious warfare fleet have not been available to support Marine Corps operations and training for years at a time.' Several amphibs cited in the report highlight these ongoing issues. USS Wasp (LHD 1), the oldest LHD class ship in the fleet at 35 years, is struggling to get parts for its conventional steam propulsion system. This is doubly concerning as the Navy mulls the possibility of extending the service lives of its LHDs beyond their 40 years to maintain fleet size. The USS Wasp (LHD-1) underway earlier this year. (U.S. Navy) Petty Officer 2nd Class Sydney Milligan 'However, officials stated that replacing steam propulsion plants is not currently a part of this effort, so the Navy will need to continue maintaining them on LHD ships,' the report states, adding that the Navy is 'taking some measures to address obsolescence issues with the machinery control systems' on LHDs LHAs starting this fiscal year. New amphibs aren’t immune to travails, either. Less than three years into its service, the USS Fort Lauderdale (LPD 28) 'is already facing limitations with its use in part because of poor equipment design,' according to the GAO. Ship and maintenance officials reported that the USS Fort Lauderdale faced challenges with the knuckle boom crane and the mechanical arm used to launch rigid hull inflatable boats (RHIB), which had high failure rates coupled with increased costs and ordering delays for parts. What’s more, fuel and ballast tank level indicators were improperly calibrated and unreliable, and sailors didn’t have the information needed to calibrate the ship’s tank level indicators, resulting in the Navy having to fly in contractors every time a part needed recalibrating. 'The ship and maintenance officials stated that some LPD system selection choices involve proprietary parts that prevent the ship’s technicians from being able to maintain certain items, such as the fiber optic navigation lights,' the report states. Aboard the USS Essex (LHD 2), shoddy contractor work and poor Navy oversight resulted in welds having to be redone because of a lack of quality assurance oversights, resulting in 'extensive rework and delays to the repair period.' A U.S. Navy Landing Craft, Air Cushion with Assault Craft Unit 5 prepares to enter the well deck of amphibious assault ship USS Essex (LHD 2) in 2021. (U.S. Marine Corps) Cpl. Israel Chincio Part of the amphibious fleet’s poor condition stems from a prior Navy decision to cancel maintenance for a sizable portion of the fleet. The Navy planned as recently as 2022 to divest 10 of its LSDs, nearly a third of the fleet, before the end of their respective service lives. Congress came back in December 2022 and prohibited the Navy from spending money to divest a portion of those ships, so the Navy had to continue operating them, 'even though it had already canceled the required maintenance periods,' according to the GAO. 'As a result, these LSD class ships fell into further disrepair, which compounded the amount of work the Navy needs to complete in future maintenance periods,' the report states. 'In 2023, the Navy found that seven of 13 incidents that affected amphibious fleet readiness were linked to LSD diesel engine problems resulting from deferred maintenance.' Canceling these maintenance plans created a backlog of maintenance work that the Navy cannot realistically complete, the report adds. GAO also found that, in some cases, deferring maintenance resulted in the Navy having to retire amphibious ships earlier than planned. The USS Fort McHenry (LSD 43) was retired in 2021, six years before the end of its service life, and Navy maintenance officials described the vessel as 'a poorly maintained ship that had accumulated a significant backlog (i.e., approximately $146 million) of deferred maintenance at the time of divestment.' USS Fort McHenry (LSD-43) in 2019. (U.S. Navy) U.S. Navy The Navy also struggles to meet its amphibious availability goals because maintenance does not happen on time, a problem that has plagued the Navy overall for years. Just three of 14 depot maintenance periods undertaken between Fiscal Years 2020 to 2022 were done on time, resulting in more than 1,200 days of cumulative delays. 'Maintenance delays can result in cascading delays to training and, ultimately, deployment,' GAO states. 'Additionally, in total, the maintenance periods cost $400 million more than the original contract value for the efforts.' GAO had identified such problems in late 2022 as it pertained to generating carrier strike groups. The watchdog recommended the Navy identify measures of success and performance in its ready-ship producing processes, but that recommendation remained unresolved as of September 2024. Like the Marines' Force Design 2030 vision, some outside analysts question if the Navy even needs such a sizable amphibious fleet, given the fact that those large ships are unlikely to be landing huge numbers of Marines under fire during a peer fight in the Pacific. When it comes to the China threat, it’s highly unlikely that the kind of amphibious force provided by an ARG would be used to conduct an amphibious invasion, given Beijing’s targeting and weapons delivery systems, according to Bradley Martin, a retired surface warfare officer who spent two-thirds of his 30-year career at sea. 'That’s not gonna happen,' Martin, now a policy researcher at the RAND think tank, told TWZ. Still, he noted that ARGs and MEUs can provide a variety of useful missions elsewhere in the world, including seizure of advanced bases, raids, reconnaissance, sea basing, supporting lower-intensity conflicts, and non-combatant evacuations, including in areas where China and Russia have major interest. Amphibious assault ships upgraded to carry F-35 fighter jets could play a role in a China fight by serving as part of the Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations (EABO) construct, which would involve keeping China guessing as to where such aircraft are operating from. Go here to read TWZ’s past coverage of EABO. U.S. Marines during an Expeditionary Advance Base Operation exercise in Okinawa, Japan, in 2020. (U.S. Marine Corps) Cpl. Donovan Massieperez The Navy and Marines would benefit from better defining and scoping the missions they want an ARG and its embarked MEU to take on, according to Martin. 'This will allow more focused attention on real-world needs,' he said. 'This could lead to better definition of readiness and force structure requirements.' Whether the Navy is planning how to use its ARGs in a China fight remains unclear. The GAO report gives a quick mention to 'a modernization effort intended to increase the ship’s relevance in the future operating environment by expanding weapons, radar and other capabilities,' that could portend readying that fleet for such a contingency, but the Navy is in the early stages of planning for this effort and had not developed budget estimates for the effort. GAO’s latest report lays bare the extent of the amphibious fleet’s problems. How the Navy, Marine Corps, the Pentagon and Congress will respond to these problems, and their myriad of causes, remains to be seen.

Russia’s Prized Bases Along The Mediterranean In Syria Could Be A...	The rapid and sudden push south by anti-regime forces in Syria has caused a geopolitical quake throughout the region. The extremely complex situation, which includes a smattering of belligerents with their own alliances and bitter enemies, has in just a week's time put Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad's rule in jeopardy once again. While the rebel factions that are pushing to unseat Assad once and for all still have a ways to go toward realizing that goal, the loss of territory in Syria's northwestern regions is clearly a glaring concern for one of Assad's chief benefactors — Russia. Assad's reign does not have to end for Moscow to suffer a massive loss in Syria. Rebel forces just have to capture the country's provinces on the Mediterranean where the prized Russian bases lie, and they are slowly getting closer to one of them by the hour. As seen in the map in the social media post below, there is already a real possibility that the area in question could just be cut off from other regime-controlled portions of the country. In #Syria Rebel forces descend on #Hama. Front line units have already attacked the outer neighborhoods. Darkened area on the map shows today's conquests by HTS. The Hama situation will unravel tonight. pic.twitter.com/PL3D7rvw5T&mdash; Alexander Stoyanov (@Al_Stoyanov) December 3, 2024 As we have reported on for years, Putin's prize for stepping in to back Assad nearly a decade ago as his regime was under crushing threat after years of civil war was two critical bases — the Khmeimim Air Base in Latakia and the sprawling naval facility in the port of Tartus. In 2017, Russia was basically gifted these facilities, with Moscow signing a '49-year lease' on both of them. This gave Russia a master air base and a naval installation on the Mediterranean, the only such facilities under Russia's control. From here Moscow could project power along NATO's southern flank and into the Middle East and Africa. And that is exactly what Moscow has done. Its naval forces have gained a warm-water port to support prolonged operations in the Mediterranean and an airfield capable of bedding down tactical and strategic airpower with the ability to strike in any direction and threaten NATO warships across the Mediterranean. 2023 image of Russia's master air base near Latakia. (Google Earth) (Google Earth) Russia's naval port in Tartus supported Russia's all-out invasion of Ukraine, working as a node to transfer materiel from Syria to the war effort. Russia's air base in Latakia not only had been used to pound anti-regime forces with heavy airstrikes for years, but it has supported Russia's activities in Northern Africa and has hosted strategic strike and intelligence aircraft. In 2019, Putin triumphantly declared victory in Syria from this base. Suffice it to say that losing such a prize would be a disaster for the Kremlin, but that could become a real possibility. A 2024 image of the port of Tartus with Russia's naval base taking up the northern portion of the facility. (Google Earth) Reports vary on exactly how close anti-regime forces are to Khmeimim Air Base. Some put them at under 20 miles away, but the situation is changing very rapidly in some areas. While 20 miles is still a decent buffer, the speed at which the offensive has penetrated certain areas has been somewhat remarkable. Still, it's not like the base would just be abandoned on a whim. The installation has been seen as among the safest locales in the country during very intense fighting that punctuated the middle and late 2010s. Russian and Syrian regime forces would put up a major fight to retain control of it. Early yesterday morning, Syrian rebel groups reached the town of Qalaat Al Madiq, northwest of Hama.

Russian forces are stretched extremely thin at this time due to the ongoing nearly three-year-old war in Ukraine. Early on in that conflict, capabilities that were placed in Syria for force protection and contingencies were realigned toward the war effort. This includes tactical airpower that had given the Assad regime the boost it needed to turn the tide of the Civil War. While Russian fighters and attack helicopters are still present at the base and have been active in slowing this current offensive, they are not deployed in the capacity they once were. Manpower and the quality of it is also of major concern. With all this in mind, just how well-equipped Russia is for dealing with a direct threat by rebel forces to the base isn't clear. Still, there aren't any indications that reinforcements are being poured into the installation or that capabilities are being evacuated, just in case. Recent satellite imagery shows little in the way of new activity at the installation. Russia has built up Khmeimim Air Base extensively over the years, including many support structures, lengthened runways, expanded aprons, and aircraft shelters which came as a result of some of the first long-range drone strikes ever realized. Multiple anti-air systems are also installed there, potentially still including an S-400 battery that can threaten aircraft well out into the Eastern Mediterranean. Sensitive intelligence gathering and electronic warfare systems are also present at the base. Tartus is roughly 30 miles to the south along Syria's shore. This puts the port in a much more secure location, for the time being. Still, there are claims that the Russian Navy has evacuated its vessels from the facility. If this proves to be an enduring reality, it would be a big deal and would hamper Russia's ability to sustain operations in Syria and across the region. At the same time, it looks as if these reports were premature, with a major naval exercise occurring in the area, including the firing of P800 Oniks anti-ship missile via the Bastion shore defense system at a target vessel — a strangely publicized show of force at a very tumultuous time in the region. P800s can also be used against land targets and a Zircon hypersonic missile was also fired as part of the exercise, Russia claims. Yes.

But Iran too is plagued with resource issues. Hezbollah, its top proxy, has been deeply degraded after months fighting Israel. It is far more limited in weaponry, manpower, leadership, and command and control capabilities than it was just months ago. This limits how much the Iranians can help Assad via Hezbollah. Other Iranian-aligned militants in Syria are also under pressure as opposition forces open up offensives against the regime on all fronts. Iran is supplying the Houthis' anti-shipping campaign in and around the Red Sea, which has gone on for over a year now, as well. Taken as a whole, the picture simply isn't the same as it was in the last decade when it comes to external resources available to back Assad and keep his regime in power. Still, there is no immediate danger of Assad being ousted by rebel forces, although internal threats always exist. This could change in the weeks to come if Syrian government forces and their Russian and Iranian backers can't put a robust defense against further advances together. We have already seen a major slowing of forward progress in some areas due to actions by Assad-aligned forces, but so much territory has already been seized so quickly. The slow-down could also help the rebels shore up their gains. If indeed the situation continues to move in favor of the anti-Assad forces and they creep closer to Russia's prized naval and air bases in Syria, exactly what Russia and the Syrian regime do in response will be monitored closely. Regardless, with resources scarce, concern has to be growing in Moscow about the safety of these critical facilities and what contingencies are needed to be put in place in order to be best ready to respond to rapidly changing circumstances.

South Korea’s New Destroyer Is Designed To Fire Ballistic Missile...	The Republic of Korea Navy (ROKN) recently commissioned the first of its new KDX-III Batch 2 destroyers, ROKS Jeongjo The Great — the service’s largest. Among the many advanced features incorporated in these warships, the latest version of the Korean Vertical Launch System — KVLS-II — is especially interesting. While initially expected to accommodate long-range surface-to-air missiles, the launchers are also planned to add ballistic missiles, which are a growing area of interest for South Korea. ROKS Jeongjo The Great (pennant number 995) was commissioned on November 27 at the HD Hyundai Heavy Industries (HD HHI) shipyard in Ulsan after more than two years of trials. This is the first of three KDX-III Batch 2 destroyers, which follow on from the three KDX-III Batch 1 warships that were commissioned between 2008 and 2012. Collectively, the KDX-III warships are also known as the Sejong Daewang class. #HyundaiHeavyIndustries has successfully delivered ROKS Jeongjo the Great, the first KDX-III Batch II AEGIS destroyer, to the #ROKNavy.

This puts it at the very top end of contemporary destroyers, closer in size to a cruiser, although these definitions have become increasingly subjective. Powered by four gas turbine engines and two auxiliary propulsion systems, the destroyer can reach a top speed of around 30 knots. Compared with the previous KDX-III Batch 1 warships, the Batch 2 features improved sensors and weapons, based on the latest Baseline 9 version of the Aegis combat system, including the AN/SPY-1D(V) multifunction radar. Overall, KDX-III Batch 2 is intended to offer enhanced surveillance, strike, and anti-submarine warfare capabilities compared with their predecessors. DDG-II Jeongjo the Great.So beautiful&#8230; pic.twitter.com/m68o7r8voT&mdash; ハク Mason (@mason_8718) November 30, 2024 Central to these capabilities are the KDX-III Batch 2’s various vertical launch systems (VLS), which are a unique mix of the U.S.-made Mk 41, the locally developed KVLS, and the improved KVLS-II. Of these, the KVLS-II is a new addition to this sub-class. Between them, these provide for a total of 88 launch cells: 48 for the Mk 41, 16 for the K-VLS, and 24 for the KVLS-II. Mk 41 VLS cells on the Jeongjo, located between the main gun and the Mk 15 Phalanx close-in weapon system (nearest camera). via X Altogether, this ‘magazine capacity’ is on par with other high-end surface combatants. For context, the U.S. Navy’s Flight III Arleigh Burke class destroyer has 96 VLS cells, while the Zumwalt class stealth destroyer has 80 cells, and the Chinese Type 055 Renhai class ‘super-destroyer’ has 112 cells. Looking at the specific weaponry for each of these launchers on the KDX-III Batch 2, the Mk 41 will be armed with the Standard Missile (SM) series for longer-range air defense, including anti-ballistic missile capability. These missiles will comprise the SM-3 Block IB, SM-2 Block IIIB, and SM-6. Of these, only the SM-2 Block IIIB is found on the previous KDX-III Batch 1. The additional missile options reflect the importance of the KDX-III Batch 2 to defend against North Korean ballistic missile attacks, while the SM-6 also offers a surface attack capability, when launched in a quasi-ballistic mode. The KVLS handles shorter-range air defense needs, being armed with the Korean Surface-to-Air Anti-Missile (K-SAAM), as well as the South Korean-designed Haesong Tactical Surface Launch Missile (TSLM) for land attack, and the Korean Anti-Submarine Rocket (K-ASROC), also known as the Hong Sang Eo or Red Shark, an anti-submarine weapon that has a homing torpedo as its payload. A K-SAAM surface-to-air missile is fired from a vertical launcher. Agency for Defense Development A diagram of the Korean Vertical Launch System (KVLS). Agency for Defense Development Finally, and most intriguingly, there are the KVLS-II cells. These are initially expected to be armed primarily with the Long-range Surface-to-Air Missile (L-SAM), another domestic missile design, also with anti-ballistic missile capability. A video showing the land-based L-SAM, developed locally by the Agency for Defense Development (ADD) as a ‘high-end’ air defense system with significant anti-ballistic missile (ABM) capabilities: However, there have long been signs that the KVLS-II will ultimately be used to accommodate other weapons, too. The KVLS-II is currently still under development with Hanwha Defense as a follow-on to the earlier KVLS, which is found on the KDX-III Batch 1 as well as the Daegu class frigates.

U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Brandon Raile/Released In the KDX-III Batch 2, the KVLS-II will be installed as six modules of four missiles each. These are located towards the rear of the vessel, aft of the twin funnels, and ahead of the helicopter flight deck. For the time being, Jeongjo is fitted with a test version of the KVLS-II, which appears to consist of just four cells, at least based on photos of the warship under construction. This suggests another five modules will be added at a later date. The KVLS-II test configuration on the Jeongjo appears to have four cells, seen on the left, next to a KVLS launcher. via X The KVLS-II reportedly retains the same ‘hot launch’ operating principle as the KVLS. With a hot launch, the missile’s main rocket booster ignites while it is still inside the launcher, in contrast to a cold launch, where the missile is ejected first, often using a compressed gas generator, before the booster ignites. Most significantly, the KVLS-II is larger than its predecessor, meaning that bigger missiles can be accommodated. According to available data, the KVLS-II is at least 3 feet (0.9m) wide and 30 feet (9.1m) deep, compared to 2 feet (0.63m) wide and 22 feet (6.8m) deep for the Mk 41 and KVLS. This equates to the ability to launch much larger weapons with far greater internal volume.

Beyond these, it’s planned that the KVLS-II will be used to deploy ballistic missiles. South Korea’s very active ballistic missile development effort already includes a ship-to-surface ballistic missile program, with research and development work led by the Agency for Defense Development (ADD). According to reports, mass production of the new missile, compatible with the KVLS-II, is expected to begin in 2028 or 2029. Already, there are a number of options for weapons that could be adapted to arm the KDX-III Batch 2 destroyers. One possible candidate would be a surface-ship-launched version of South Korea’s submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), a weapon that has been test-launched from the ROKN’s Dosan Ahn Changho class diesel-electric attack submarine, as well as from a submerged barge, and from a ground test facility. The submarine ROKS Dosan Ahn Changho during trials. Defense Acquisition Program Administration Few details about South Korea’s SLBM have been made public, although the country’s media variously describes it as the Hyunmoo-4-4 or the K-SLBM. It reportedly has a range of 311 miles (500km) and is likely a naval variant of the ground-launched Hyunmoo-2B ballistic missile. For its sub-launched application, the SLBM uses the cold launch ejection method, again from VLS tubes. A South Korean Hyunmoo-2 ballistic missile is launched during a joint South Korean/United States military exercise in 2017. US Army As well as the SLBM program, South Korea’s ballistic missiles include a range of land-based weapons, too, with more under development. Seoul’s defense budget proposal for 2022-2026 refers to a new ballistic missile capable of carrying a warhead weighing up to three tons, compared to the two tons for the Hyunmoo 4 short-range ballistic missile (SRBM), and with a range of between 220 and 250 miles (350 and 400km). According to reports, this new missile would be tailored to destroy hardened underground sites, including North Korea’s nuclear storage facilities. Fielding some kind of ballistic missile on its KDX-III Batch 2 destroyers certainly reflects broader priorities, as stated by the South Korean Ministry of Defense. The country’s wider missile development plan calls for weapons 'with significantly enhanced destructive power' as part of its response to North Korea’s expanding missile capabilities. With North Korea’s expanding missile arsenal presenting particular risks to ground-based missiles in South Korea, ship-launched ballistic missiles — as well as even more survivable SLBMs — are seen as a very useful addition to Seoul’s armory. An increased focus on ballistic missiles has almost certainly also been spurred by South Korea having stepped away from a series of restrictions on missile range that had been in place since 1979, under a bilateral agreement with the United States. Most recently, these put a range cap of 500 miles on South Korean missiles. Since U.S. President Joe Biden and South Korean President Moon Jae-in agreed to scrap these limits, South Korea is now able to develop ballistic missiles capable of reaching targets far beyond the Korean Peninsula. President Joe Biden talks during a joint news conference with the then South Korean President Moon Jae-in, in Washington in May 2021. AP Photo/Alex Brandon This means that ballistic missiles can potentially be developed for use against threats further afield, including China and Russia. Furthermore, as TWZ has discussed in the past, there remains a possibility that Seoul may eventually seek to add nuclear warheads to its burgeoning ballistic missile force, although this seems a more remote possibility at this point. In the case of the KDX-III Batch 2 destroyers, the inherent versatility of the KVLS-II system means that the available cells can be loaded with a mixture of weapons. These could include air defense missiles, cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, and potentially future hypersonic missiles. The KVLS, for its part, is also a highly versatile system, covering inner-zone air defense as well as anti-submarine warfare and land attack. We all know that the South Korean military is crazy about firepower but nothing would show that the Korea is crazy about firepower as KVLS-II and its IV-2 Ship-Launched ballistic missile(and Hyunmoo-V).The KVLS-II is designed to store large and devastating Korean strike missiles… pic.twitter.com/VaS1VEI8IS&mdash; ハク Mason (@mason_8718) March 8, 2024 It should be noted that even without ballistic missiles, the KDX-III Batch 2 warships, and multiple other platforms — surface combatants, submarines, ground launchers, and aircraft — have the ability to launch cruise missiles against targets across North Korea. Still, ballistic missiles continue to offer certain advantages, including superior speed of response and kinetic energy, a larger warhead, as well as being much harder to defend against. In particular, a missile of this kind would be very well suited to attacking a hardened target at short notice, for example decapitating regime command bunkers in the opening phase of a conflict. Increasingly, ballistic missiles are also being adapted as anti-ship weapons, as well, something that China has done, in VLS-compatible form, for its destroyers. At this stage, however, it’s not clear if South Korea also has an ASBM program. More broadly, the KVLS-II is indicative of a broader trend toward outfitting warships with bigger vertical launch cells, to accommodate new kinds of weapons, including hypersonic missiles, which are typically larger than their subsonic brethren. The U.S. Navy is looking toward larger VLS cells beyond the Mk 41, with the Mk 57 being slightly larger, while the Zumwalt class is getting bigger cells for hypersonic weapons. America's next generation destroyer will likely include some larger VLS cells, as well, and America's future fast attack submarines are already being built with the ability to accommodate larger missiles if need be. Whatever the long-term plan for arming South Korea’s KDX-III Batch 2 warships, once commissioned, these will be some of the most impressive destroyers in service anywhere in the world. At the core of their capabilities will be their extensive and varied vertical launch system cells, of which the KVLS-II brings the option of a very wide range of munitions — including ballistic missiles.

Claims Swirl Around U.S. Strikes In Eastern Syria	Amid a now six-day-old rebel offensive in northwestern Syria against the Assad regime, the U.S. military has backed a Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) offensive operation in the eastern part of that war-torn country, a U.S. official told The War Zone Tuesday morning. That operation took place around Dier Ezzor, a town on the Euphrates River that has been a center of fighting between the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led SDF and various jihadi groups and militias. While the U.S. official told us that the operation was against ISIS, there are reports that it was against Assad's forces. 'An SDF operation occurred, they requested support and we supported them,' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss operational details. The official declined to say how the U.S. assisted but emphasized that it had 'nothing to do with events in the northwestern part of Syria,' which is taking place about 150 miles west of Deir Ezzor. 'This is not outside our normal capacity,' the official added. 'The mission remains unchanged. We are still there to defeat ISIS and that mission remains unchanged.'

The concern, according to SDF, is that ISIS is trying to exploit the turmoil taking place about 150 miles west as the anti-Assad fighters continue their push south toward Hama. 'In light of the serious security situation arising from recent developments in western Syria, particularly in the Badia region, and the existence of a serious threat related to the imminent movement of large ISIS terrorist cells to control geographical areas unprotected, especially in the north and east of Deir Ezzo, we confirm that our forces have become responsible for safeguarding the populations of the villages of Salhiya, Tabia, Hatla, Khesham, Marrat, Mazloum, and Husseiniya in the eastern countryside of Deir Ezzor,' SDF explained.

Statement On The Recent Situations In Villages East Of Deir Ezzor Syrian Democratic Forces (@SDF_Syria) December 3, 2024 While the U.S. official insisted that the operation it backed is not connected to the uprising against Assad, there are claims that the attacks were either against Iranian-backed militias or Assad’s forces. Troops from 'a U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led coalition 'battled Syrian government forces in northeastern Syria early on Tuesday, both sides said,' Reuters reported on Tuesday, adding that it is 'opening a new front for President Bashar al-Assad who lost Aleppo in a sudden rebel advance last week. Airstrikes also targeted Iran-backed militia groups supporting Syrian government forces in the strategically vital region, a security source in eastern Syria.' The Hezbollah-linked Al Mayadeen media outlet on Tuesday reported that the attacks are related to the rebel offensive and carried out on behalf of the SDF-affiliated Deir Ezzor Military Council 'which stands for armed groups supported by U.S. occupation forces, operating under the SDF and controlling areas north of the Euphrates River, where several US military bases are located.' Al Mayadeen's 'correspondent confirmed that U.S. occupation forces had instructed Deir Ezzor Military Council militants to launch an attack on Syrian Army positions in the seven villages in the Deir Ezzor countryside, coinciding with an offensive by the terrorist Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group and other opposition factions on Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama countrysides,' the publication stated. 'Intense clashes were reported between Deir Ezzor Military Council militants and the Syrian Army on the outskirts of the towns of al-Salihiya, Marrat, and al-Tabiya in northern Deir Ezzor, where the US-backed militants shelled Khasham village in Deir Ezzor countryside with 12 mortar rounds. Violent clashes were also reported between the militants and the Syrian Army on the al-Salihiya front in northern Deir Ezzor.' The SDF gained no ground in the operation, Al Mayadeen wrote. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a London-based watchdog group monitoring said aircraft from the U.S.-led anti-ISIS international coalition 'executed intensive airstrikes on positions of Iranian-backed militias in the region, amid frequent flights by Coalition aircraft over the ‘seven villages’ area.' SDF forces gained no ground in the operation, according to SOHR. #SOHRDespite ground and aerial support | Deir Ezzor Military Council fails to break first line of defence of 'seven villages' in Deir Ezzor المرصد السوري لحقوق الإنسان (@syriahr) December 3, 2024 On Monday, the Pentagon’s top spokesman was asked if the SDF was preparing 'to launch an operation in seven villages controlled by al-Assad regime near Conoco oil field.' 'So as I'm sure you can appreciate, we are in contact with the SDF as they are one of our key partners on the enduring defeat of ISIS mission,' Air Force Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder told reporters. 'I won't speak for the SDF or talk about their potential future operations other than to say that again, we will continue to coordinate closely when it comes to the threat of ISIS and ensuring that they're not able to resurge throughout Syria or into Iraq. I'll just leave it there.' Ryder, emphasizing that the U.S. has no involvement in the rebel offensive, added that American forces have recently come under fire in the Deir Ezzor area and responded with defensive actions. 'There was a rocket attack against one of our facilities in Syria,' he said. 'No U.S. personnel were injured; no infrastructure damaged. Separately, on the 29th, there was a self-defense strike near [Mission Support Site] MSS Euphrates. U.S. forces essentially [took] out a potential threat to that facility.

The Syrian insurgents 'have launched attacks in the central province of Hama, threatening to cut off government troops from a key route linking the capital, Damascus, with rebel-held Aleppo,' the Guardian reported on Tuesday. 'The army was engaging in 'violent confrontations with armed groups in Hama, the Syrian state news agency Sana reported.' Insurgents said they were 'positioned about six miles from Hama city, the country’s fourth largest city, and that their forces had captured the towns of Maardis and Soran just north of the city,' the publication stated.

Surprise Martial Law Declaration Throws South Korea Into Turmoil	South Korean military forces have descended on the country's parliament building and other parts of the capital Seoul following President Yoon Suk Yeol's unexpected declaration of martial law. South Korea's political opposition has decried Yoon's surprise move, the first of its kind in more than 40 years, which has already led to scuffling between civilians and security forces. Yoon announced he was imposing martial law across the country in a brief televised announcement late on Tuesday local time. It is now Wednesday, December 3 in South Korea. In a televised address, President Yoon Suk Yeol said his decision to impose martial law in South Korea is supposedly critical for defending the constitutional order. He also vowed to eradicate 'anti-state forces,' without elaborating on what exactly is meant by that term. pic.twitter.com/8xA8212Mux&mdash; DW News (@dwnews) December 3, 2024 'The martial law is aimed at eradicating pro-North Korean forces and to protect the constitutional order of freedom,' Yoon said, according to South Korean news outlet Yonhap. President Yoon, a member of the People Power Party, accused the opposition Democratic Party of Korea of 'clear anti-state behavior aimed at inciting rebellion' and of having 'paralyzed state affairs and turned the National Assembly into a den of criminals,' according to CNN. He said that martial law was required to remove the 'shameless pro-North anti-state forces' and pledged to 'eliminate the anti-state forces and restore the country to normalcy as quickly as possible.' This is the first time in more than four decades that South Korea's government has declared martial law. In 1980, the military dictatorship then in charge of the country made the move in response to pro-democracy protests. From NYT: 'This is the first time in 44 years that a South Korean leader has declared martial law. It was declared in 1980 during a pro-democracy uprising against the military.'&mdash; Alex Ward (@alexbward) December 3, 2024 The War Zone subsequently obtained a South Korean military proclamation regarding the martial law declaration that states the following: 'To safeguard liberal democracy and protect the safety of citizens from the threat of anti-state forces attempting to overthrow the Republic of Korea, the following orders are proclaimed effective from 11:00 PM on December 3, 2024, across the entire nation: All political activities, including those of the National Assembly, local councils, political parties, and any political associations, assemblies, and demonstrations, are prohibited. All acts that deny or attempt to overthrow the liberal democratic system, as well as the dissemination of fake news, manipulation of public opinion, and false propaganda, are prohibited. All media and publications will be subject to the control of the Martial Law Command. Strikes, slowdowns, and gatherings that incite social disorder are prohibited. All medical professionals, including resident doctors, who are currently on strike or absent from their medical duties, must return to work and faithfully carry out their responsibilities within 48 hours. Violators will be punished under the Martial Law Act. Measures will be taken to minimize inconvenience to ordinary, law-abiding citizens, except for anti-state forces or those attempting to overthrow the system. Violators of this proclamation will be subject to arrest, detention, and search and seizure without a warrant under Article 9 (Special Authority of the Martial Law Commander) of the Martial Law Act. They will also be punished under Article 14 (Penalties) of the Martial Law Act.' As already noted, South Korean military forces subsequently deployed to the National Assembly building, the seat of the country's parliament, and other areas of Seoul.

The Yoon administration has also been struggling to tackle strikes by doctors that have now put significant strain on the country's healthcare system. It also comes at a time of heightened tensions between South Korea and North Korea, the latter of which has been taking steadily more hostile actions, as well as becoming more deeply embroiled in Russia's war on Ukraine. Yoon has taken a hardline stance toward the North and has been actively pushing for a greater buildup of South Korea's armed forces. He has even raised the possibility of his country's developing its own nuclear arsenal. South Korea is a major U.S. ally with approximately 28,500 American military personnel forward-deployed in the country. 'The Administration is in contact with the ROK government and is monitoring the situation closely,' a spokesperson for U.S. President Joe Biden's National Security Council told The War Zone. The full extent of the fallout from Yoon's martial law declaration remains to be seen, but it is certainly an extremely worrisome development for the country. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available.

Qatar’s Strange New Warship Combines Air Defense Frigate And Amph...	The capabilities of Qatar’s Navy took a leap forward when Italian shipmaker Fincantieri delivered the country’s first multi-mission landing platform dock (LPD) last week, an outright unique warship that combines features of a surface combatant and an amphibious assault ship. Al Fulk, has a very 'interesting' appearance, featuring a deck gun on its bow, vertical launch system (VLS) arrays tacked onto its side, and an unusually proportioned flight deck. Looks aside, it's a fascinating vessel that packs a lot of capability into a relatively efficient package. The ship is the culmination of a multi-billion dollar deal inked nearly a decade ago, and offers the latest signal of the country’s burgeoning military might as it seeks to strengthen itself in a very tough neighborhood. The 468-foot-long, 71-foot-wide ship’s technology and versatility represent a significant maritime upgrade for the Qatari Emiri Navy (QEN). Displacing roughly 8,800 tons in a full combat load (nearly the same as a Flight II Arleigh Burke class frigate), Al Fulk can serve as a sea base of sorts, sporting a flight deck that can host light or medium helicopters, including the nation’s NH90 helicopter fleet. The Al Fulk also features a roomy garage with two vehicle ramps and a floodable well deck that will allow the ship to deploy landing craft that can ferry armored vehicles, troops, and other materiel ashore. The Qatari landing platform dock Al Fulk. Fincantieri While one of its primary mission sets will be leading the area air defense mission, which is normally executed by traditional surface combatants, the ship can do a lot of other things, especially roles that are normally carried out by more mission-focused LPDs. For one, it will give the Navy the ability to cruise far from home. The ship’s two main diesel engines propel the vessel to a maximum speed of 20 knots, and the ship can sail for 7,000 nautical miles at 15 knots, according to Fincantieri. Such range primes the Al Fulk to be able to take on extended deployments inside and far outside of the Gulf. It can also host up to 550 people on board. Fincantieri has not clarified how many personnel are required to crew the ship, but another variant of its class requires just 152 sailors. The larger full complement would include troops and aviation support personnel. 'The LPD is a niche capability that could be the backbone of a multinational operation in the region and significantly augment the capabilities of partner navies,' Andreas Krieg, CEO of the London-based consulting firm MENA Analytica, told Breaking Defense in 2023. 'It could function as a hub for greater maritime operations in the Gulf and Indian Ocean.' Al Fulk was the centerpiece of a nearly $6 billion, seven-ship deal finalized in 2017 that included multiple corvettes and patrol boats. Four Al Zubarah-class corvettes and two Musherib-class offshore patrol vessels had already been delivered to Qatar by the time Al Fulk was handed over in a ceremony at the Muggiano shipyard in Italy on Nov. 29, company officials told TWZ Monday. The ship is based on an enhanced version of Fincantieri’s San Giusto design, one of which, the Kalaat Béni Abbès, is already in use by Algeria. Rendering of an Al Zubarah-class corvette. (Ficantieri) While neither Doha nor Fincantieri are believed to have publicly stated precisely what is installed aboard Al Fulk, the Algerian variant was delivered in 2014 and features an advanced electronic warfare suite capable of detecting, categorizing and jamming threats that is likely on the Qatari variant as well, TWZ previously reported. Kalaat Béni Abbès also includes the Italian defense company Leonardo’s ATHENA advanced Combat Management System. The Kalaat Béni Abbès. (Fincantieri) It isn't clear if the same system or an outgrowth of it is also equipping the Qatari variant, but that seems more probably than not. Al Fulk features a Leonardo-built Kronos Power Shield radar. The Kronos AESA radar utilizes an energy-efficient gallium-nitride-based technology to maximize detection capabilities, all within a compact package, according to past TWZ reporting: 'The system can rapidly switch between broad, 360-degree area search and more focused tracking modes. There is also a 'fence' functionality able to track short- and medium range ballistic missiles, but only in a very limited envelope. Leonardo says that the complete 430-square foot array offers a typical maximum search range of between approximately 930 and 1,240 miles, though this would be dependent on a host of environmental factors and the nature of the targets in question.' The two eight-cell Sylver vertical launch system (VLS) arrays that can fire 16 Aster 30 surface-to-air missiles (Aster 15s are also possible) provide the arrows in Al Fulk's quiver. This package of systems concievably gives the ship the ability to provide area air defense, including the ability to intercept tactical ballistic missiles, as well as shoot down traditional air breathing anti-ship cruise missiles, helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, and various aerial drones at significant distances. The 16-cell VLS array can be seen here. In addition to its own capabilities, the Al Fulk will serve as a mother ship and command and control asset for the four corvettes, providing long-range targeting information, Enrico Bonetti, then the shipbuilder’s senior vice president for naval vessels said at the Doha International Maritime Defence Exhibition & Conference (DIMEX) in 2018. The corvettes, with a displacement of 3,250 tons at full combat load, were also slated to have their own Aster 30 missiles and radars, TWZ previously reported. Bonetti also said at DIMDEX that a 76mm rapid fire main gun would be on the Al Fulk as well as the corvettes, along with Sylena Mk 2 decoy launchers that would, along with smaller automatic cannons for close-in protection, provide additional defensive capabilities. Each corvette was also slated to have a RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile launcher for close-in defense. A U.S. Navy RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM).

U.S. Navy Photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Hector Carrera And amidst a fleet of smaller corvettes and offshore patrol vessels, Al Fulk is the largest and most advanced warship that that force has fielded to date. It also comes as the country continues on a prolific military acquisition spree, which includes many new and highly-capable fighter jets. Doha has in recent years bought advanced 4th generation fighter jets from three sources, and began adding advanced jet trainers to its fleet in 2022. Go here to read more on how the Qatari Emiri Air Force is growing. Multiple reasons exist for Qatar betting big on a LPD, according to the non-profit Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. Qatar is an exporter of liquified natural gas and needs to secure export routes, and senior officials have spoken of terrorism, regional instability and drug smuggling as other factors for building out the Navy, the institute’s Albert Vidal wrote in August 2023. The Fincantieri deal that brought Qatar the Al Fulk was followed by a $1.1 billion deal with multinational missile company MBDA to build missiles for the new ships, Vidal writes, and that was followed by a $3.7 billion purchase of 28 NH90 helicopters from Leonardo, 12 of which are configured for naval operations. We have officially handed over, at our Muggiano shipyard, the amphibious vessel LPD 'Al Fulk' to the Ministry of Defence of Qatar as the completion of a significant naval program for the Qatari Navy. The ceremony was attended, among others, by the Commander of the Qatar Emiri… pic.twitter.com/tI0UFwx7IW&mdash; Fincantieri (@Fincantieri) November 29, 2024 Qatar is also building out its naval infrastructure and seeking to grow its Navy to 7,000 sailors by 2025, up from less than 3,000 sailors, Reuters reported in 2018. Qatar’s acquisition of Al Fulk inevitably provides the country with extra military might in a very tense region, while offering the tiny but wealthy nation a way to contribute to multinational combat and foreign humanitarian missions in ways that exceed any of its capabilities in the past.

Airstrikes Slow Advance Of Anti-Assad Forces In Syria	As the anti-Assad regime forces' surprise counteroffensive against regime forces stretches into its fifth day, Russia and Syria have stepped up their aerial bombardment campaign to slow it down. That appears to be having some effect on what until now had been a lightning-quick advance. Adding to the challenge, forces supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad continue to pour into the Hama region to create a defensive line against the advance led by Hayyaat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS). To further assist the regime, hundreds of Iranian-backed Iraqi militia fighters have crossed the border to join the fight. The dramatic (HTS) advance 'has somewhat slowed in the past 24 hours,' according to Al Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu, reporting from the Turkish-Syrian border. 'The advances by the Syrian opposition continue on the battlefront, but not as fast as before,' Koseoglu said. 'The acceleration is down as the diplomatic efforts to discuss the crisis have risen within the last two days.' Syrian government forces 'appeared to be regrouping to counterattack Monday,' The Washington Post noted.

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said Tehran 'is ready to improve cooperation with Syria to overcome the ongoing crisis in the Arab country in the wake of the resurgence of terrorism,' Press TV reported on Telegram. However, at least one Iranian effort to resupply his troops was thwarted by the Israeli Air Force (IAF). IAF jets reportedly forced an Iranian supply plane to leave Syrian airspace and head back to Iran, the Times of Israel reported. The interception was part of a larger Israeli effort to prevent Iranian weapons from reaching the Lebanese terror group, during a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah that has seen multiple violations. 'In recent months, the Israel Defense Forces has forced several Iranian flights to make U-turns over Syrian or Iraqi airspace, after they were suspected of carrying weapons to Hezbollah,' the publication reported. 'IAF fighter jets intercepted the Iranian plane [-suspected to be ferrying arms to the Hezbollah terror group in Lebanon-] over Syria and ordered it to turn around, and it did a short while later, a defense source said.'

Troops from the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Defense Force (SDF) as well as Kurdish militant groups the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and the Syrian Kurdish YPG are also waging their own campaign against Turkish-backed militants like the Free Syrian Army (FSA) and the Syrian National Army (SNA). Highlighting the complex nature of the Syrian battlespace, SNA has also fought Assad as well as ISIS and HTS. The current clashes between the Kurdish forces and the Turkish-backed groups have spilled over into Aleppo. SDF commander Mazloum Abdi said in a statement on Monday that his fighters in northwestern Syria were facing intense attacks on multiple fronts. The group had tried to establish a 'humanitarian corridor' linking Kurdish-held northeastern regions to Tel Rifaat, a strategic area northwest of Aleppo to 'protect our people from potential massacres,' Reuters reported. 'However, attacks by armed groups supported by the Turkish occupation have disrupted this corridor,' Abdi said. He added that 'our forces continue to resist to protect our people in the Kurdish neighborhoods of Aleppo.' HTS leaders offered a safe passage for YPG militants in Aleppo to move further north in Syria toward the Turkish border. They also emphasized that their fight is solely against Assad and Iranian militias and reaffirmed that Kurds are part of Syrian society and have the same rights.

Russia has accumulated huge losses in its nearly three-year-old full-on invasion of Ukraine. Iran, meanwhile, saw its Lebanese proxy Hezbollah suffer huge losses in a fight against Israel, which appears to be ongoing despite a ceasefire agreement. Tehran has also contributed a large amount of resources to the Yemeni Houthi rebels in their continuing campaign against Red Sea shipping in support of Hamas' fight against Israel. One factor that may work to Assad's advantage is the growing cooperation between Russia and Iran over the fight in Ukraine. Iran has provided thousands of drones and hundreds of ballistic missiles while Russia has provided Iran with cash and captured U.S. and British weapons. Both nations have significant reasons to want to see the offensive fail and it is possible they can pool limited resources to make that happen. For the Russians, two key bases along the Mediterranean Sea are at stake. Assad's ouster would likely mean Russia loses Khmeimim Air Base, near the city of Latakia, and their port facilities at Tartus, further to the south That would be a huge blow to Russian President Vladimir Putin both militarily and prestige-wise. Iran, meanwhile, would suffer the loss of a massive center of gravity abutting its arch-enemy Israel. Should HTS and its allies take over much of Syria, Iran's ability to ship arms across the border to Hezbollah in Lebanon would be imperiled given the rebel forces' long fight against that group. Iranian-backed militias in Syria would also be at major risk of being taken off the board. Amid the fighting, there are behind-the-scenes diplomatic efforts to pull Assad away from Iran and place him under the U.S. umbrella. The U.S. and the United Arab Emirates 'have discussed with each other the possibility of lifting sanctions' on Assad 'if he peels himself away from Iran and cuts off weapons routes to Lebanon's Hezbollah,' Reuters reported, citing five people familiar with the matter. 'The conversations intensified in recent months,' the sources told the news outlet. The effort is 'driven by the possible expiry on Dec. 20 of sweeping U.S. sanctions on Syria and by Israel's campaign against Tehran's regional network, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza and Iranian assets in Syria.' It is highly unlikely that happens. Regardless, even if it does, the idea that Assad would pull the plug on efforts to take back lost territory seems like a reach.

Final MiG-21 Fishbeds Stand Down From Active Duty In Europe	The last of the classic Cold War-era MiG-21 Fishbed fighters in Europe have been stood down from operational duties. Assigned to NATO, the Croatian Air Force was the final European operator of the MiG-21, a type that originally entered service back in 1959 and which had been a presence over the continent ever since then, in the hands of over a dozen different nations. Croatia’s Ministry of Defense announced that, as of yesterday, December 1, its MiG-21s — which equip its sole fighter squadron — would no longer defend the country’s airspace during peacetime quick reaction alert (QRA) duty.

U.S. Air Force photo by Tech. Sgt. Miquel Jordan Tech. Sgt. Miquel Jordan Although Croatia has already begun to receive far more advanced Dassault Rafale multirole fighters, these won’t start operational duties yet, since they are required for pilot training. The Croatian Ministry of Defense had previously expected the Rafale to achieve initial operational capability by the end of 2025, but this could slip until early 2026. A Croatian Air Force Rafale touches down at Pleso Air Base, Croatia, on April 25, 2024.

Ironically, both the Typhoon and Gripen had been offered to Croatia to replace its MiG-21s, together with F-16 Block 70/72s and second-hand F-16s, before the Rafale was chosen in May 2021. The final selection of the Rafale was also protracted, only happening after an earlier deal for 12 second-hand Israeli F-16C/Ds had collapsed in 2019 after the U.S. Congress refused to approve the transfer of the fighters.

Mulag/Wikimedia Commons The Croatian government is not paying for the stopgap QRA coverage, with the air defense fighters being provided under a NATO arrangement broadly similar to the alliance’s Baltic Air Policing mission, which protects the Baltic states. Currently, the Croatian Air Force has received seven Rafales (five single-seaters and a pair of two-seaters), with the remaining five single-seaters due to arrive by the end of April 2025, at the rate of one aircraft per month. Like the MiG-21s, the Rafales fly from Pleso Air Base, also known as the 91st Air Base, co-located with the international airport in the country’s capital, Zagreb. As we reported before, the 12 Rafales will provide a huge leap in capabilities for the Croatian Air Force, which will advance from a second-generation fighter armed with short-range air-to-air missiles to an advanced fourth-generation jet offering active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, beyond-visual-range air-to-air missiles, precision attack, and many other potential new capabilities.

Ex13/Wikimedia Commons The only air defense armament available to the MiG-21s was the infrared-guided R-60MK (AA-8 Aphid) air-to-air missile, as well as the internal 23mm twin-barrel cannon. The Fishbed had a particularly important air defense role, considering that Croatia for many years otherwise only operated anti-aircraft guns, man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS), and vehicle-mounted Strela-type short-range surface-to-air missiles. It’s unclear when the MiG-21s will cease flying altogether, with the potential that some training activities or familiarization flights will still take place. However, as of now, the Fishbed has ended its operational service in Europe. The last previous operator on the continent, Romania, retired its upgraded MiG-21 LanceR fleet in May 2023. In recent years, only a handful of Croatian MiG-21s were still active, hampered by dwindling supplies of spares.

Malissa Lott Emerging from the violent breakup of Yugoslavia, Croatia received its first MiG-21 when a Yugoslav Air Force pilot defected to the country in one of the jets in February 1992. The windfall fighter was then put into Croatian service but was shot down over Bosnia and Herzegovina in June of the same year. Another pair of MiG-21s arrived in Croatia via defections in May 1992, one of these also being lost in combat. As recently independent Croatia built up its air force, it acquired 40 MiG-21s from Ukraine between 1993 and 1994, these aircraft having been originally used by another ex-Soviet state, Kyrgyzstan. These were provided to Croatia despite an arms embargo. Of these fighters, 26 were put into Croatian service, while the other 14 were used for spare parts. As well as another wartime shoot-down, in May 1995, the Croatian Fishbed fleet suffered six attrition losses after hostilities had come to an end in September 1995.

Dana Potts Dana Potts With no replacement in sight, in 2003, Croatia decided to provide eight of its single-seat MiG-21s with a modest upgrade, undertaken in Romania, which was intended to allow them to serve until 2024. However, this was primarily an overhaul and is in no way comparable to the extensive modernizations undertaken on Indian or Romanian MiG-21s, for example. At the same time, another four two-seat MiG-21s were acquired, either from Poland or Romania. With NATO membership on the horizon, the upgrade did add Western communication, identification, and navigation systems and the aircraft emerged from the work with new designations: MiG-21bisD for the single-seaters and MiG-21UMD for the two-seaters. A single two-seat Croatian Air Force MiG-21UMD was painted in this striking red-and-white scheme to reflect Croatia’s national colors. Chris Lofting/Wikimedia Commons A further overhaul and refurbishment for seven Croatian MiG-21s took place in Ukraine, between 2013 and 2015, and Zagreb also bought another five Fishbeds at the same time, although these turned out to be problematic, and all of them spent a period grounded. Meanwhile, the Croatian government investigated their provenance, amid reports that four of them had fuselages taken from second-hand Bulgarian MiG-21s, which would have breached the terms of the contract. With the MiG-21’s retirement looming, Croatia held a public farewell for its MiGs at Pleso in May of this year, which also included participation from the Rafale.

At the same time, Croatia will go down in history as the final operator of the MiG-21 in Europe. The Fishbed still serves elsewhere in the world, however, notably in India and North Korea, while smaller numbers of the iconic fighters are still operating in a handful of other countries.

Stand-In Attack Missile Released From Fighter For First Time In U...	A U.S. Air Force F-16C Viper has conducted the first test release of a Stand-in Attack Weapon (SiAW) missile. The service has said it expects the F-35A Joint Strike Fighter to be the first operational launch platform for the SiAW, which is being developed to provide a high-speed strike capability against a variety of time-sensitive ground targets. The Air Force put out a picture of the F-16C from the 40th Flight Test Squadron releasing the SiAW test missile, seen above, over a range in the Gulf of Mexico earlier today. The test flight was staged from Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, but it is unclear when exactly it occurred. Prime contractor Northrop Grumman announced the delivery of the first SiAW test article last month, but it is not clear if that was the missile dropped in this test or how many others have been delivered since. The missile is derived from the AGM-88G Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile-Extended Range (AARGM-ER), which has already been in flight testing for years now. The first SiAW test article delivered to the US Air Force. Northrop Grumman 'The test missile used, called a jettison test vehicle, contained no rocket motor or internal electronics. The JTV is a tool used specifically to determine whether the weapon safely separates from the aircraft upon commanded release,' according to an official Air Force release. 'The goal of the test was to prove the new weapon could separate from an aircraft successfully, a major milestone, so further testing can begin.' 'Test conductors planned and controlled the mission out of the Eglin Central Control Facility,' the release adds. 'Engineers monitored the separation and will conduct post-flight analysis soon.' Separation testing is an important part of the development of any new air-launched munition. Not all stores act the same way after release, and this can be further impacted by what station on what type of aircraft they are released from. The historical video montage below highlights the very serious potential risks that these tests are designed to help mitigate. For SiAW, gathering data on how the missile separates from any pylon would be a useful starting place toward working up to future tests. The picture of the F-16 dropping the test article also gives a good sense of just how big the weapon is overall. A low-resolution picture the Air Force also released showing the SiAW test missile under the wing of the 40th Flight Test Squadron F-16C. USAF As already noted, the expectation is that the F-35A will be the first operational launch platform for the missile and that those jets will be able to carry them in their internal bays, which will require additional separation testing. Internal carriage will allow the A model Joint Strike Fighters to employ the weapons while operating in their most stealthy mode. A picture showing a fit check of the AARGM-ER design in the internal bay of an F-35A or C variant. Orbital ATK www.twz.com The Air Force has said the SiAW could also arm 'future stealth aircraft' in addition to the F-35A, which might include the B-21 Raider stealth bomber and uncrewed types. Regardless of the launch platform, 'the Stand-in Attack Weapon (SiAW) system will provide capability to strike rapidly re-locatable targets that create the Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) environment,' the Air Force said in its 2025 Fiscal Year budget request, released back in March. 'SiAW targets include Theater Ballistic Missile Launchers, Land Attack and Anti-Ship Cruise Missile Launchers, Jammers, Anti-Satellite Systems, and Integrated Air Defense Systems.' This is a broader array of targets than the ones the AGM-88G is primarily intended to defeat. The AARGM-ER is optimized for supporting the suppression and destruction of enemy air defenses (SEAD/DEAD) mission sets. However, that missile will still have an inherent secondary general strike against targets on land and at sea, as you can read more about here. A US Navy F/A-18F Super Hornet fires an AGM-88G AARGM-ER during a test. Northrop Grumman It is also possible that the SiAW could find its way onto other aircraft within the service, as well as with other U.S. and foreign operators. Sized for the A version of the F-35, the missile would also be able to fit inside the bays on U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine F-35Cs, though not in the smaller ones on F-35Bs that the Marines and others fly. All three types could be able to carry the missiles externally, too. Depending on the SiAW's maximum range, it may also be an option for non-stealthy platforms like the F-16, especially when leveraging third-party targeting data to help stay away from threats. Those aircraft could also employ the weapon against air defense assets or other high-value targets of opportunity that might suddenly emerge closer by. Currently, the Air Force's stated goal is to reach initial operational capability with SiAW at least on F-35A by 2026. Flight testing of the missile is now fully underway.

Detailed Deck View Emerges Of China’s Mysterious Aircraft Carrier...	Additional photos provide a more detailed look at the mysterious Chinese flattop that TWZ was first to report on, and which recently went to sea, apparently for its first trials. While the exact function of this vessel remains murky, the recently published photos do confirm that it’s intended to operate rotary-wing aircraft (perhaps in addition to fixed-wing drones), but there are no obvious signs of catapults or arrester cables of the kind that would be used for operating heavier fixed-wing types. There is also no indication that the vessel has a floodable well deck like those found on many amphibious warfare ships. You can find TWZ’s full previous analysis of the intriguing vessel here. The new aviation-capable Chinese vessel in port, providing a first proper look at the starboard side of the ship. Chinese Internet via X Another view of the mysterious aviation-capable Chinese vessel. Chinese Internet via X The new photos show the vessel in port, seen from above, providing a good look at the large open flight deck. On the forward half of the deck are two sets of markings associated with operating rotary-wing aircraft, either crewed or uncrewed.

As we discussed before, the superstructure nearest the bow includes a bridge and conventional-type mast, while the larger central one has a rear-facing glazed tower area for managing flight operations, plus a prominent mast, although the spherical radome seen on top in previously published images is missing here. The new images also show no windows on the starboard side of the central island. Finally, the structure closest to the stern houses the ship's exhaust stacks. 中船一号，体制外'航母' pic.twitter.com/r7BSjCOGZq&mdash; DS北风（风哥） (@WenJian0922) December 1, 2024 In one of the photos, we might be able to see an elevator to move aircraft between the main deck and a hangar deck, located between the first and second superstructures. This area is somewhat obscured by construction-related equipment and the opening could be simply an access point. A close-up of the area between the first and second superstructures, with an aperture that could be a trapdoor-type elevator. Chinese Internet via X If this is not an elevator, it’s not immediately clear how aircraft would be moved between the deck and the hangar. We already know there’s no elevator on the left side of the ship, and the aperture in the same position on the starboard side may well also be used for stowing a lifeboat inside. It’s also conceivable that no hangar deck is present at all. While details of the port facility have been obscured, the location may well be Guangzhou Shipyard International’s (GSI) facilities on Longxue Island, just southeast of the city of Guangzhou, where the vessel was built. GSI is a subsidiary of the China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC), whose logo is prominently displayed on the exhaust stack. The speed with which the project has been undertaken is notable.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Construction work on the new vessel appears to have started sometime after May of this year, with the launch following sometime between mid-September and mid-October. Although the photos give us a better idea of the overall configuration of the vessel, it’s still unclear whether this is a People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) project or if it’s being pursued as a private venture by CSSC. With still no signs of obvious military-style markings or a hull number, the latter option currently looks more likely. The mysterious aircraft carrier during recent sea trials. 民用版075试航 pic.twitter.com/reQIGlxhNN&mdash; DS北风（风哥） (@WenJian0922) November 26, 2024 The photos of the vessel so far suggest that it’s intended to operate crewed helicopters and drones, while the overall appearance may well point to a simpler and cheaper design and one that can be produced rapidly, if required, by commercial shipbuilders. The PLAN’s interest in expanding its use of various tiers of drones from all of its big deck warships, including its aircraft carriers and big deck amphibious assault ships, has been well documented. A vessel of this kind could provide the PLAN with additional naval airpower capacity without the same level of capability as a true aircraft carrier or a multifunctional amphibious assault ship, like the impressive Type 076 class, which you can read more about here. A picture that just emerged in May of this year showing the Type 076 taking shape at the Hudong-Zhonghua yard. Chinese Internet Particular missions in which such a vessel could be highly relevant to the PLAN’s broader doctrine could include scenarios in the South China Sea or around the Taiwan Strait. Furthermore, crewed helicopters and drones could be operated from it in support of anti-submarine warfare operations, as well as amphibious operations. Previously, we also looked at the possibility that the new vessel was built to meet a known Chinese government requirement for a 'large-scale special deck operation' ship for maritime survey and other test/research activities. As well as a flight deck, this called for a 'dock compartment,' although that is missing from this vessel. That’s not to say that the vessel might not be related to a similar requirement for an ostensibly civilian research ship, but one that could equally flex to military operations, or be used for ‘gray zone’ warfare that falls between the two. A model of a catamaran-type mini-aircraft carrier intended to launch and recover small aerial drones, shown at the Zhuhai Airshow in 2021. Chinese Internet This would also provide parallels with Chinese efforts in building various types of more specialized drone mothership vessels, claimed to be primarily for training and testing purposes, but which could also have operational roles. Even without a well deck, a ship of this kind could still deliver forces ashore via helicopters, during a variety of different contingency scenarios. These could include amphibious assault but also support during humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations. For now, we can’t say for sure whether CSSC’s new design is intended for training, testing, or demonstration, or whether it will become an operational crewed helicopter/drone carrier for the PLAN. But with the vessel having already gone to sea, as part of a very rapid development program, we are sure to learn more about it in due course.

AI-Enabled HX-2 Kamikaze Drones Now In Production For Ukraine	German firm Helsing says production of its HX-2 kamikaze drone, thousands of which are expected to be sent to Ukraine, is underway. The company states that the HX-2s feature stand-off range, artificial intelligence (AI) enabled capabilities that make them resistant to electronic warfare systems, and can be employed in networked swarms. Helsing offered new details about the HX-2 as part of an official rollout of the one-way-attack drone earlier today. The Bild newspaper in Germany had first reported on the HX-2 and plans to send thousands of them to Ukraine last month. An HX-2 drone in flight. Helsing The electrically-powered HX-2, which has an x-shaped main wing and tail configuration, weighs close to 26 and a half pounds (12 kilograms), has a top speed of almost 137 miles per hour (220 kilometers per hour), and a maximum range of 62 (100 kilometers), according to Helsing. The company also says the drones, also reportedly known by the name 'Karma,' can be loaded with multi-purpose warheads, as well as ones optimized for use against armored vehicles or structures. 'Onboard artificial intelligence ensures that HX-2 is immune to hostile electronic warfare (EW) measures through its ability to search for, re-identify, and engage targets, even without a signal or a continuous data connection,' Helsing says on its website. 'A human operator stays in or on the loop for all critical decisions.' What kind of onboard sensors and other systems the HX-2 has to support these capabilities is unclear. As seen below, the drone does have two small apertures in the nose, which are likely electro-optical and/or infrared cameras, as well as what looks to be a small pitot tube off to one side. Helsing 'When operating as part of Helsing’s Altra recce/strike software, multiple HX-2s can assemble into swarms, controlled by single human operators,' a Helsing press release adds. A rendering depicting a swarm of HX-2s. Helsing 'HX-2 has been designed to be mass-producible and at significantly lower unit cost than conventional systems,' the Helsing release continues, but does not provide any further details about unit cost When exactly Ukraine might get its first HX-2s is unclear. Bild's report said that the first tranche of the drones would be delivered to Ukraine sometime this month and that around 4,000 would be sent in total. The press release today says the drone's 'capabilities [were] developed and tested through Helsing’s extensive experience in Ukraine' and that core technology is currently deployed in Ukraine.' A picture simply titled 'Field' that Helsing released along with its HX-2 announcement today. Helsing Regardless, the HX-2 looks set to offer Ukrainian forces a valuable array of capabilities coupled with a significant range allowing for strikes deeper behind the front lines, even for relatively small units. Electronic warfare is in heavy use on both sides of the conflict in Ukraine, especially against drones. AI-enabled targeting has already emerged as one of a number of countermeasure options. The War Zone has explored in detail in the past how AI is pushing uncrewed aerial systems toward a major new evolution, if not a revolution in capabilities, especially when it comes to dynamic targeting and operating in large groups or fully networked swarms. As we have previously written: 'The ability would open up dynamic targeting deep in contested territory. For Russia, for instance, this would be a huge advantage as it has failed to gain air superiority over Ukraine and has very limited ability to hit non-static targets far beyond the front lines. The same can be said for Ukraine. It could hunt for and strike land Russian vehicles deep in occupied territory, something it cannot do today because it too lacks air superiority and is confronted with the dense air defense overlay that sits atop the entire region. Flying these drones deep into those air defenses makes sense even if they do not complete their mission. A long-range kamikaze drone may cost thousands of dollars, but the high-performance surface-to-air missile that knocks it down will likely cost much more and would take far longer to replace.' 'Waves of similar drones could be sent to their own individual geographical ‘kill boxes,’ or defined areas of engagement. Collectively, they could put enemy targets at risk over a huge area persistently without ‘doubling up’ and attacking the same target twice. Using machine learning/AI and associated hardware they could not just identify targets of interest, but also differentiate moving from still targets, to ensure they are indeed active (not destroyed or already damaged) vehicles. Meanwhile, they can be set to engage other target types, such as surface-to-air missile systems or other high-priority targets, regardless of whether they are static or not. Even troop movements on the ground could potentially be recognized and attacked. All the parameters as to what the drone can engage, and where it can do so, can be defined and tailored to each mission before launch.' Helsing says the HX-2's onboard software can be updated wirelessly 'to dynamically adapt to new threats and tactics.' It's unclear if the drones are designed to receive those updates in flight in the middle of a mission. The War Zone has also previously highlighted how AI algorithms can be rapidly trained in a digital environment, as well as incorporate data collected from actual real-world employment, to improve their ability to spot, categorize, and engage targets. A view of an HX-2 from the rear. Helsing Increasing autonomy for kamikaze drones and other weapon systems has also prompted a broader ethical debate, which Helsing has proactively sought to address in relation to the HX-2. 'As a company founded in democratic countries and on democratic values, we have a special duty to approach the development and deployment of advanced defense systems, such as strike drones, with particular responsibility and thoughtfulness,' a section on Helsing's site says. 'We believe in the principle that a human needs to be in or on the loop for all critical decisions; and we know that enforcing this principle requires conviction and technological leadership, especially in the face of adversaries taking shortcuts.' If nothing else, a new stream of relatively low-cost kamikaze drones by itself is a boon for Ukraine, especially amid growing uncertainty about the future of foreign military aid contributions. The German government, which has been especially reluctant to send stand-off strike munitions to Ukraine also looks to be presenting HX-2 as an alternative that still demonstrates its commitment to supporting Kyiv. Some reports say that the drone has been nicknamed the Mini-Taurus, an apparent reference of sorts to Germany's repeated rebuffing of requests for air-launched Taurus cruise missiles. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was in Kyiv just today where he was shown numerous kamikaze drones that Ukraine has developed domestically. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz inspected the AQ 100 Bayonet kamikaze drones in Kyiv today. He was also shown Ukrainian analogs of the Russian 'Lancet' and a smaller version of Iranian Shahed-136 kamikaze UAV. pic.twitter.com/qnZCaeVPaf&mdash; Clash Report (@clashreport) December 2, 2024 In addition, as already noted, the HX-2's capabilities reflect broader trends that are not limited to the fighting in Ukraine. The threats that kamikaze drones and other weaponized types pose, which are not new, as well as the potential benefits they could offer in friendly hands, have now been fully driven into the public consciousness. Uncrewed aerial systems capable of executing one-way attacks or of dropping munitions, in particular, have become an increasing fixture in conflicts globally, including in the recent surge in fighting in Syria. There is no sign that their proliferation, or that of new functionality, including AI-driven features, among state armed forces, as well as terrorists and other non-state actors, will slow any time soon. The overall bar to entry to fielding weaponized drones is already low. Helsing is one of a steadily growing number of companies worldwide, including many smaller ones, that are now looking to enter this market space or expand their existing presence there, including by leveraging experience from supporting Ukrainian forces. It remains to be seen when definitive evidence of the HX-2's use in Ukraine will emerge, but the drone is a sign of things to come beyond that conflict.

Aleppo Has Fallen, Assad’s Forces Regrouping As Rebels Blitz Sout...	A day after entering Aleppo, rebels have reportedly seized most of the city, Syria’s second-largest, pushed south toward Hama and captured much of Idlib province on Saturday in their surprise offensive launched on Thursday. In reaction, the Russian Air Force bombarded rebel positions in Aleppo, the first time they've struck the city in any robust capacity in the better part of a decade . Meanwhile, there are unconfirmed reports of a coup attempt against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the capital of Damascus. You can catch up with our previous report on the rebel advance here. Led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, this offensive is its first major attack against the regime in four years and comes as Iran's top proxy force Hezbollah and Russia - Assad’s biggest backers - are embroiled in their own conflicts. Hezbollah, which supports the Assad regime, has been greatly degraded after open conflict with Israel and some Russian resources have been realigned away from Syria to fight in Ukraine. HTS, formerly an al-Qaida-affiliated group known as al-Nusra Front, has since cut its ties to the notorious Sunni jihadi organization. ALEPPO, SYRIA - NOVEMBER 30: Armed groups opposing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime seized control of much of Aleppo's city center in Syria on November 30, 2024. Reaching Sadallah al-Jabiri Square, a central location in the city, the groups advanced further, taking over a significant portion of Aleppo. In a short period, the opposition forces also seized the governor's office, the police headquarters, and Aleppo Citadel, a symbolic landmark of the city.

Assad on Saturday vowed to 'defend [Syria's] stability and territorial integrity in the face of all terrorists and their backers,' according to the BBC. '[The country] is capable, with the help of its allies and friends, of defeating and eliminating them, no matter how intense their terrorist attacks are,' his office quoted him as saying. The Syrian strongman is getting help in the form of the aforementioned Russian airstrikes on rebel positions in Aleppo. Russian tactical jets and attack helicopters have been active from Khmeimim Air Base, near the city of Latakia, since 2015, providing vital support to the regime in Damascus. The bombardment reportedly resulted in civilian casualties, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a London-based watchdog organization monitoring the conflict. 'At least 16 civilians were killed and 20 others were injured in a horrific massacre carried out by fighter jets believed to be Russian, targeting a gathering of people at Al-Basel Roundabout in Aleppo city,' SOHR claimed 'The number of civilians and combatants, who were killed in Idlib and Aleppo countryside during the 'Deterrence of Aggression' operation which started in the early hours of November 27, has increased to 327.' Aleppo has already been badly ravaged by years of war. It was first captured by rebel forces in 2012 and it became the site of a months-long siege in 2016. Russia and Syrian aircraft carried out constant air strikes that destroyed entire neighborhoods as Syrian regime forces fought to recapture the city of roughly two million residents. HTS also said on Saturday that it had taken control of several areas on the outskirts of Hama, a government-controlled city and Syria’s fourth-largest. The rebels took over regime positions in at least 15 villages and towns, according to SOHR. 'This approach coincided with consecutive withdrawals by the regime forces from positions in Hama City, Hama Military Airport and several other positions, while several members of a military convoy of the regime fled,' SOHR reported. 'Meanwhile, nearly 15 military convoys withdrew from Hama towards Homs.' The status of control over Hama remains unclear and the city could still remain at least partially contested. Regardless, the airbase there that was used by Russia and the regime as under rebel control, as is the main airport in Aleppo.

Syria state TV stopped broadcasting.The videos and information are not verified. pic.twitter.com/y3SGGTM83X&mdash; Anton Gerashchenko (@Gerashchenko_en) November 30, 2024 Officials from Iran have pushed back on those claims. Hossein Akbari, the Iranian Ambassador to Syria, said there was no military coup in Damascus nor any attempt to detain Assad, the official Iranian Shafaq news agency reported. 'The news published by some Iranian online platforms about a coup in Damascus surprised us,' Akbari stated, 'The Syrian army knows what needs to be done. This sedition will be crushed, God willing.' A reporter for Tasnim, another official Iranian news outlet, said the streets of Damascus are calm and called the claims 'a psychological operation by the terrorists and their supporters to break the resistance and advance further.' The War Zone cannot confirm any of these claims The ongoing offensive against the regime is one of the most serious challenges Assad has faced since the Syrian civil war began in 2011 when regime forces responded to Arab Spring protests with deadly force. That ignited years of bloodshed, forcing some 14 million Syrians to flee their homes, about half to places elsewhere in the country. The vacuum created by all this conflict has turned Syria into a regional crisis, drawing in troops from Turkey, Kurdish forces from Iraq and Iranian-backed Lebanese Hezbollah fighters. Israel routinely bombs Iranian troops and weapons concentrations in Syria. Jerusalem is watching the rebel advances in Syria with considerable wariness, as intelligence chiefs told the political echelon developments in Syria could ultimately spell trouble for Israel, according to Israeli media. 'Referring to a consultation hurriedly convened by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday evening with key figures in the defense establishment…intelligence officials assessing that ‘Iranian infrastructure in Syria has been harmed, and much of it has been captured by the rebels,’' the Times of Israel reported. Netanyahu was reportedly said that Hezbollah’s attention will now be shifted to Syria, and 'so will its forces, in order to defend the Assad regime.' Israeli intelligence officials are concerned that Assad's fall could allow the 'strategic capabilities' of his regime to fall into the jihadists’ hands. The prime concern relates to 'the remnants of chemical weapons,' according to the Times of Israel. Amid all this, the U.S. maintains a presence near Deir Ezzor in the north officially to continue the fight in a coalition against ISIS, which established a so-called 'caliphate' in large portions of Syria and Iraq in the wake of years of conflict. Saturday night, the White House said the U.S. 'has nothing to do with this offensive, which is led by Hay’at Tahir al-Sham (HTS), a designated terrorist organization&#8230;We will also continue to fully defend and protect U.S. personnel and U.S. military positions, which remain essential to ensuring that ISIS can never again resurge in Syria.'

How much longer Assad can hold on is a lingering question, exacerbated by the fact that his two main backers have their own troubles siphoning off resources otherwise available for Syria. Russia is bogged down in a nearly three-year-old war in Ukraine, forcing it to redeploy capabilities and personnel that were previously being used in support of the Syrian regime. Russian interests in Syria include the aforementioned Khmeimim Air Base, as well as access to port facilities at Tartus. These two bases serve as the only Russian facilities of their kind in the Mediterranean, making them highly strategic but also symbolic prizes that Moscow gained in exchange for saving Assad. Iran, meanwhile, has seen its proxy Hezbollah, which has a substantial presence is Syria, severely weakened by Israel, and the Israeli Air Force has continued to pound Iranian and Iranian-proxy targets in Syria. The HTS-led offensive has been as stunning as it has been swift. Whether it has the troops, equipment and logistical tail to not only push through Hama, but further south to Homs and eventually Damascus is something we will learn more about in the coming days. And while a lightning-fast blitz may be impressive, holding the territory gained against regrouped Syrian-Russia-Iranian-backed forces will be no easy task.

Rebel Forces Enter Syria’s Second Largest City Of Aleppo	Syrian rebels have entered the country’s second city of Aleppo, after launching a dramatic surprise attack on the government-held areas of northern Aleppo province earlier this week. The development is significant: not only was Aleppo previously seen as very well defended, but it has also been four years since Syrian government forces lost significant swathes of territory. The insurgents had entered Aleppo as of this afternoon, local time. Meanwhile, the Associated Press said that residents reported hearing missiles striking the city’s outskirts.

Ahead of that, there were multiple reports and further videos showing fierce fighting on the outskirts of the city. Reports suggest that the rebels entered the city from the southwest outskirts, with clashes with regime forces reported less than six miles from there earlier today, in an area straddling the Idlib and Aleppo provinces. Mohamed Bashir, the leader of the jihadist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which is at the forefront of the rebel offensive, stated in a press conference today: 'This operation aims to repel the sources of fire of the criminal enemy from the frontlines.'

Paweł Wójcik (@SaladinAlDronni) November 29, 2024 'The highway has now been put out of service after it was reopened by regime forces years ago,' the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based monitor of the conflict, said. The rebels have also taken the junction of the M5 and M4 highways, which connects Damascus and Aleppo with Latakia, a regime stronghold on the coast. #Syria: rebel forces have seized the village of Tal Hadya as they continue to advance along and across the M5 highway in SW #Aleppo. pic.twitter.com/vU3QY2DZB6&mdash; Thomas van Linge (@ThomasVLinge) November 29, 2024 Earlier today, the observatory said that 182 people had been killed in the current offensive, of which 102 were HTS fighters, 19 from allied factions, and 61 from regime forces and allied groups. A significant number of the rebel fatalities were caused by Russian airstrikes. Russian fighter-bombers have been active from Khmeimim Air Base, near the city of Latakia, since 2015, providing vital support to the regime in Damascus. #Syria: as rebels advance across western #Aleppo the #Assad regime is bombarding the town of Darat Izza, hitting women and children.

The rebel offensive was only launched on Wednesday, apparently led by the HTS but also includes other allied factions, including Turkish-backed Syrian rebel groups. After HTS fighters flooded out of their base in the rebel-held Idlib countryside, the northwest of Syria was scene to some of the fiercest fighting seen in the country for several years. Already, rebels have taken dozens of towns and villages in the Aleppo countryside and have captured a military base, weapons, and tanks from Syrian government forces. #Syria: a rebel soldier shows some of the vehicles that were abandoned by the regime in the 46th Regiment base in western #Aleppo.At least two tanks and a BMP. pic.twitter.com/ZcNuQJoKSK&mdash; Thomas van Linge (@ThomasVLinge) November 28, 2024 #Syria: in yet another major development, Syrian rebels seem to have captured a number of MANPADS surface-to-air missiles.This severely limits the regime's capabilities to retaliate from above. pic.twitter.com/yBnMGYNIzy&mdash; Thomas van Linge (@ThomasVLinge) November 29, 2024 Russian equipment has also fallen into rebel hands, as evidenced in the videos below.

Syrian government forces have meanwhile been hitting the rebels hard, as they try and blunt their advance. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), regime forces have carried out at least 125 airstrikes and shelled areas across the Idlib and western Aleppo provinces. In the process, at least 12 civilians have been killed and 46 injured, while 14,000 more have been displaced, the OCHA says.

Assad’s forces put down the original uprising with assistance from Russia and Iran. The arrival of Russian military forces in 2015, in particular, proved to be a turning point for Assad. After losing control of around four-fifths of the country, the Russian intervention helped swing the conflict back in favor of the regime.

In more recent years, with backing from Moscow and Tehran, Assad has remained in power, while the intensity of the conflict has decreased. However, the level of control Assad has over the country is fragile in places, as the latest rebel offensive has demonstrated. Notably, as well as having control over much of the northwest Idlib area, HTS also has strongholds in smaller areas within the Aleppo, Hama, and Latakia provinces.

Photo by Anas Alkharboutli/picture alliance via Getty Images picture alliance At the same time, more pressure has been applied on the Syrian regime by Israel, which has stepped up its campaign of airstrikes targeting Iranian proxy forces that operate in the country. This has put the Iranian forces on the defensive, meaning they can no longer contribute as much to shoring up Assad’s forces against the rebels. In addition, Tehran is currently more focused on the fate of Hezbollah in Lebanon, and Hamas in Gaza, as well as the prospect of further strikes on its own territory by Israel. HTS has specifically said it will target Iranian forces fighting alongside Syrian government troops. Yesterday, an Iranian news agency reported the death of a general in Iran’s Revolutionary Guards in Syria, during fighting between government forces and jihadists. As well as more than 100 Israeli airstrikes on Syrian territory, the war in the Middle East has forced around half a million people to flee the conflict in Lebanon for the relative safety of Syria. Assad’s other major backer, Russia, is meanwhile bogged down in the war in Ukraine, where it has redeployed forces — including air defense units — that were previously being used in support of the Syrian regime. Rebel fighters pose in front of a seized Syrian Army tank in the village of Talhiyah, located east of the northwestern Syrian city of Idlib after the area was taken over by jihadists and their Turkish-backed allies in the latest battles with government forces in the northern Syrian Aleppo province, on November 29, 2024. Photo by Omar HAJ KADOUR / AFP OMAR HAJ KADOUR This leaves Syria as something of a distraction for Russia and it’s notable that, in a statement from the Kremlin today, its spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, called upon Syrian authorities to quickly regain control and thwart the rebel attack, which he described as a violation of Syria’s sovereignty. Russian interests in Syria include the aforementioned Khmeimim Air Base, as well as access to port facilities at Tartus. These two bases serve as the only Russian facilities of their kind in the Mediterranean, making them highly strategic but also symbolic prizes that Moscow gained in exchange for saving Assad.

Photo by PAUL GYPTEAU/AFP via Getty Images PAUL GYPTEAU Another major player is Turkey, which backs several rebel groups active along Syria’s northern border. Recently, Turkey has made efforts to re-establish relations with Assad, but it’s unclear exactly how it will respond to this latest round of fighting. Already, some Turkey-backed factions have joined the new offensive. At this point, it appears that the Syrian rebels, including HTS, have identified a weakness in the Syrian regime’s grip on the northwest of the country, compounded by Israel’s attacks on Iranian proxies in Syria, as well as Russia’s focus on Ukraine. Even against this backdrop, it’s surprising how fast the Syrian regime forces have apparently crumbled in the face of the latest rebel offensive. It remains to be seen whether Aleppo will fall but there are also major questions about the ability of Assad’s forces to respond in an effective way, especially without rapid backing from Russia and/or Iran.

If you can’t handle yourself in that manner, then please, discuss virtually anything else. No drive-by garbage political memes. No conspiracy theory rants. Links to crackpot sites will be axed, too. Trolling and shitposting will not be tolerated. No obsessive behavior about other users. Just don’t interact with folks you don’t like. Do not be a sucker and feed trolls! That’s as much on you as on them. Use the mute button if you don’t like what you see. So unless you have something of quality to say, know how to treat people with respect, understand that everyone isn’t going to subscribe to your exact same worldview, and have come to terms with the reality that there is no perfect solution when it comes to moderation of a community like this, it’s probably best to just move on.
