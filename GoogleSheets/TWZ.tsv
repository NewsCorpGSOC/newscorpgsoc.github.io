AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon To Equip Ukraine’s F-16s: Report	Ukraine will likely receive a number of AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) glide munitions in a new $375 million U.S. aid package next week, Politico reported. The unpowered air-to-ground weapon has a range of over 70 miles, depending on flight profile, so it can be launched from outside the range of most enemy’s air defense systems. JSOWs do not have the reach of air-launched cruise missiles like the U.K.-French Storm Shadow/Scalp-EG it has received, or the German Taurus KEPD 350 cruise missiles it has long coveted. They also aren't as capable, long-ranged, hard-hitting, or stealth as the AGM-158 JASSM cruise missiles Ukraine wants most for its F-16s. However, it still gives Ukraine a weapon that can fire from safer distances at Russian troop concentrations, air defenses, and other targets, and navigate around air defenses to get there. .

(Photo by LEILA GORCHEV / AFP) LEILA GORCHEV In a previous analysis of potential Ukrainian F-16 weapons, we described JSOW as the most likely new advanced weapon Ukraine would receive with its donated F-16 Vipers. You can read our complete report on what could be available for Ukraine's here. The analysis continued: '[JSOW] is very well suited for the unique combat environment in Ukraine. It can autonomously glide to its target from over 70 miles away when launched at altitude or over a dozen miles when launched at low altitude. It could be especially useful for target geolocated static/semi-static air defense systems and its imaging infrared sensor it uses for terminal homing is impervious to radio-frequency jamming. It has a very small signature, as well, making it that much harder for Russian air defenses to shoot down.' JSOW had been delivered in cluster and unitary warhead configurations, with the latter being the focus of production today. Zelensky is scheduled to visit Washington next week, where he will present his peace plan as well as appeal to the Biden administration to remove restrictions on the use of long-range weapons deep inside Russia. This package, also likely to include artillery ammunition, rockets and air defense missiles, will be the largest package the U.S. has sent Ukraine since May, Politico noted. It could be the last presidential drawdown of equipment before the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. Under authority granted by Congress, the U.S. pulls existing weapons from its stockpiles, and the money is meant to purchase replacement munitions and equipment. The Pentagon is working with Congress to roll the remaining $5.9 billion left in the presidential drawdown authority (PDA) over to the next fiscal year, spokesman Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said last week in a statement. No deal has been struck yet as lawmakers struggle to come up with a plan to avoid a government shutdown on Oct.1, which will occur if no stopgap funding measure is passed in time. NEW: In a first, US will likely send Ukraine the Joint Standoff Weapon for its F16s. It's a precision missile that can travel around 70 miles. It's part of a $375M aid package expected to be announced Monday. Paul McLeary (@paulmcleary) September 20, 2024 The Latest Russia lost up to three months' worth of ammunition during the massive Sept. 18 Ukrainian drone attack on a sprawling storage facility in the country’s west, an Estonian intelligence officer told reporters on Friday. Ukraine managed to hit the warehouse when part of the ammunition was not completely placed in the bunkers, and that set off a chain of explosions, Ants Kiviselg said, according to the Estonian ERR news outlet. You can see the first moments of the attack in a video posted on Twitter. Short video of the first moments of the attack on a Russian Toropets ammunition storage and the panic of local residents. pic.twitter.com/UBN13AL6kV&mdash; Special Kherson Cat (@bayraktar_1love) September 20, 2024 About '30,000 tons of ammunition exploded, that is, 750,000 shells,' he claimed. 'At the average rate of hostilities, Russia produces 10,000 shells per week. That’s a two- to three-month supply of ammunition.' 'We will see the consequences of this loss at the front in the coming weeks,' he added. The War Zone cannot independently verify Kiviselg's assessment. Toropets suffered widespread damage in the attack, though one analyst suggested the loss of ammunition was likely far less than the numbers posited by Kiviselg. I have counted more than 90 destroyed buildings at the base. In 2018, Russian state media reported that each 'storage facility' can hold 240 tons of ammunition. If every building was full that would be a loss of approx. 21,600 tons. The real number is likely significantly lower.&mdash; Kyle Glen (@KyleJGlen) September 20, 2024 Data collected by NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) showed that the facility was still smoldering days after the attack.

In addition, other accounts suggested that that guided bombs, artillery, and S-400 air defense missiles were also stored there. The head of Ukraine’s Center for Countering Disinformation, Andriy Kovalenko, said on Telegram that the facility in Toropets was also being used to store ballistic missiles supplied to Russia by North Korea. The facility was still spewing smoke a day after being attacked, according to this Maxar Technologies satellite image taken Wednesday. A huge explosion rocked the Tver region, in the west of Russia, with initial reports indicating that Ukrainian long-range attack drones targeted an ammunition depot there. Videos and pictures on social media from the scene show an initial explosion, with a very large fireball, followed by a significant visible shockwave, then several minutes’ worth of secondary explosions illuminating the night sky.(Satellite image ©2024 Maxar Technologies) Russia depends heavily on artillery barrages on the front lines and deep-strike missile attacks on Ukrainian cities to prosecute this war. While the Estonian claim of 750,000 artillery shells is certainly a huge number, Russia has received millions of rounds from North Korea. Pyongyang has also supplied Moscow with ballistic missiles, as has Iran, which has also delivered thousands of Shahed drones. Still, in a war where its troops are consistently overmatched in terms of artillery, facing three-quarters of a million fewer shells would be good news for Ukraine. On the battlefield, Ukrainian forces continued to push westward in its Kursk salient but neither side made confirmed advances, according to the latest assessment from the Institute for The Study of War (ISW). There is visual evidence that Ukraine tried to advance toward the town of Veseloe. That's located about five miles southwest of Glushkovo, a tactically important city on the Seim River. The idea is to try and create a pincer, catching thousands of Russian troops between Glushkovo and Tetkino, about 13 miles to the west. However, as the last video below shows, the Ukrainian advance came under heavy fire with several vehicles likely destroyed. Meanwhile, Russia pounded Ukrainian positions in Kursk with glide bombs.

Geolocated footage published on September 19 indicates that Russian forces recently marginally advanced southwest of Mykhailivka (southeast of Pokrovsk and just east of Selydove).

'With many different units — all in various states of combat effectiveness — deployed to the Pokrovsk front, effective communication between brigades is a crucial factor that is often lacking,' soldiers from two brigades told the publication. 'One officer of the 68th, who asked not to be identified because of the nature of his comments, said that for months over summer, one of the neighboring brigades would consistently fail to report lost positions, leaving his own units vulnerable from the flank without knowing about it,' the Kyiv Independent reported. 'In our area, there are a lot of different units, and communication between them becomes a big problem,' said one of those soldiers.

'The Ukrainian Defense Forces have now managed to reduce the assault capabilities of the occupiers in the Donetsk region,' he said in his evening address on Thursday. 'The situation remains extremely challenging, with heavy fighting daily in the Kurakhove and Pokrovsk directions. But we are doing everything possible for the resilience of our combat brigades. A separate issue was the operation in the Kursk region. We have already managed to divert around 40,000 Russian troops to this area. Our active operations continue. The 'exchange fund' is also being replenished for us, for Ukraine. All these are important factors influencing the overall situation in the war. I thank all our combat brigades, every soldier, sergeant, every commander, for their bravery.' The shortage of troops is not something just affecting Ukraine. The issue has become so dire for Russia that its Defense Ministry officials have unsuccessfully pressed President Vladimir Putin for more troops, The Wall Street Journal reported. 'Months before President Vladimir Putin’s inauguration in May, he met with Defense Ministry officials who pushed for a fresh round of mobilization to recruit more troops to offset Russia’s losses on the front line in Ukraine,' the publication reported, citing a person briefed on the exchange. 'Putin dismissed the idea, saying he wanted to use only those who were voluntarily signing military contracts,' the person said. 'Forces are currently not sufficient to achieve the original war aims, knock Ukraine out of the war, to undermine its military potential or protect border regions of the Russian territory. More and more people are saying mobilization is inevitable.'

Before his F-16 went down, Mes, who went by the call sign 'Moonfish,' shot down three Russian cruise missiles and a one-way attack drone, Ukrainian Air Force Command West said on Facebook at the time. 'One scenario floating among the Ukrainian defense community is that the F-16 flew inadvertently through a cloud of debris created by the successful intercept and destruction of one of the incoming Russian missiles,' Breaking Defense reported. 'These fragments of the destroyed missile may have caused damage to the engine and other parts of the aircraft, causing the F-16 to break apart and/or the death of the pilot before he could eject.' This version 'is emerging as one of the more plausible scenarios, due to past precedence,' the publication noted, citing Ukrainian defense industry executives. One of them told the outlet that 'earlier in the war we lost four other fighters to this same cause of airborne foreign objects disabling the aircraft.' A Ukrainian F-16 piloted by pilot Oleksii Mes allegedly crashed due to the impact of a downed Russian missile. Other Ukrainian aircraft could also have been disabled for the same reason, Breaking Defense reports, citing sources in Ukraine.&mdash; Hromadske Int. (@Hromadske) September 20, 2024 France plans to upgrade Mirage 2000-5F jets being donated to Ukraine to help the country strike Russian ground targets, according to the SudOuest media outlet. The aircraft could be delivered with valuable new munitions, including versions of the MICA beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile. The -5F variant is optimized for air-to-air use, but the plan now appears to be using them as ground-attack jets, employing air-to-ground munitions that France has already been sending to Ukraine, such as the stealthy SCALP-EG cruise missile and the Hammer rocket-assisted precision-guided bomb.

The ban, announced Friday, was enacted out of national security concerns during the all-out war with Russia. 'During a meeting on Thursday, the Security Service of Ukraine and the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said Telegram is actively used by Russia for cyberattacks, phishing, spreading malware, establishing user locations and calibrating missile strikes,' The Associated Press reported. 'An exception to the ban will be allowed for people who use the app in their official duties. Ukrainians are free to use the app in their personal devices.' The app is widely used in Ukraine and Russia not only for texting but also for reading news, including updates on Russian air attacks. Telegram is also the primary way Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, engage with the public and relay war developments. Zelensky is likely to continue using Telegram in his public communications since it is in his official capacity, the AP reported.

Videos and pictures on social media from the scene show an initial explosion, with a very large fireball, followed by a significant visible shockwave, then several minutes’ worth of secondary explosions illuminating the night sky.(Satellite image ©2024 Maxar Technologies) Russia depends heavily on artillery barrages on the front lines and deep-strike missile attacks on Ukrainian cities to prosecute this war. While the Estonian claim of 750,000 artillery shells is certainly a huge number, Russia has received millions of rounds from North Korea. Pyongyang has also supplied Moscow with ballistic missiles, as has Iran, which has also delivered thousands of Shahed drones. Still, in a war where its troops are consistently overmatched in terms of artillery, facing three-quarters of a million fewer shells would be good news for Ukraine. On the battlefield, Ukrainian forces continued to push westward in its Kursk salient but neither side made confirmed advances, according to the latest assessment from the Institute for The Study of War (ISW). There is visual evidence that Ukraine tried to advance toward the town of Veseloe. That's located about five miles southwest of Glushkovo, a tactically important city on the Seim River. The idea is to try and create a pincer, catching thousands of Russian troops between Glushkovo and Tetkino, about 13 miles to the west. However, as the last video below shows, the Ukrainian advance came under heavy fire with several vehicles likely destroyed. Meanwhile, Russia pounded Ukrainian positions in Kursk with glide bombs.

'With many different units — all in various states of combat effectiveness — deployed to the Pokrovsk front, effective communication between brigades is a crucial factor that is often lacking,' soldiers from two brigades told the publication. 'One officer of the 68th, who asked not to be identified because of the nature of his comments, said that for months over summer, one of the neighboring brigades would consistently fail to report lost positions, leaving his own units vulnerable from the flank without knowing about it,' the Kyiv Independent reported.

'The Ukrainian Defense Forces have now managed to reduce the assault capabilities of the occupiers in the Donetsk region,' he said in his evening address on Thursday. 'The situation remains extremely challenging, with heavy fighting daily in the Kurakhove and Pokrovsk directions. But we are doing everything possible for the resilience of our combat brigades. A separate issue was the operation in the Kursk region. We have already managed to divert around 40,000 Russian troops to this area. Our active operations continue. The 'exchange fund' is also being replenished for us, for Ukraine. All these are important factors influencing the overall situation in the war. I thank all our combat brigades, every soldier, sergeant, every commander, for their bravery.' The shortage of troops is not something just affecting Ukraine. The issue has become so dire for Russia that its Defense Ministry officials have unsuccessfully pressed President Vladimir Putin for more troops, The Wall Street Journal reported. 'Months before President Vladimir Putin’s inauguration in May, he met with Defense Ministry officials who pushed for a fresh round of mobilization to recruit more troops to offset Russia’s losses on the front line in Ukraine,' the publication reported, citing a person briefed on the exchange. 'Putin dismissed the idea, saying he wanted to use only those who were voluntarily signing military contracts,' the person said. 'Forces are currently not sufficient to achieve the original war aims, knock Ukraine out of the war, to undermine its military potential or protect border regions of the Russian territory. More and more people are saying mobilization is inevitable.'

Before his F-16 went down, Mes, who went by the call sign 'Moonfish,' shot down three Russian cruise missiles and a one-way attack drone, Ukrainian Air Force Command West said on Facebook at the time. 'One scenario floating among the Ukrainian defense community is that the F-16 flew inadvertently through a cloud of debris created by the successful intercept and destruction of one of the incoming Russian missiles,' Breaking Defense reported. 'These fragments of the destroyed missile may have caused damage to the engine and other parts of the aircraft, causing the F-16 to break apart and/or the death of the pilot before he could eject.' This version 'is emerging as one of the more plausible scenarios, due to past precedence,' the publication noted, citing Ukrainian defense industry executives. One of them told the outlet that 'earlier in the war we lost four other fighters to this same cause of airborne foreign objects disabling the aircraft.'

The -5F variant is optimized for air-to-air use, but the plan now appears to be using them as ground-attack jets, employing air-to-ground munitions that France has already been sending to Ukraine, such as the stealthy SCALP-EG cruise missile and the Hammer rocket-assisted precision-guided bomb.

What American Fighters And Their Drone Wingmen Fighting Chinese J...	Collins Aerospace has put forward a vision for what a high-end air combat engagement between the U.S. and Chinese armed forces, with the American side employing crewed fighters and Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drone wingmen, could look like in the future. A division of Raytheon (now formally known as RTX), Collins released the glitzy computer-generated video seen below last week primarily to showcase its work on autonomous capabilities that could support the U.S. Air Force's CCA program, as well as the U.S. Navy's separate, but closely related effort of the same name. The video opens with U.S. forces forming for the mission at hand. CCAs are showing taking off from a remote airstrip and an aircraft carrier. This highlights the potential for the drones to be launched from disparate operating locations and not necessarily ones tied to the basing of their crewed companions. The War Zone has noted in the past how drones with limited dependence on traditional runways, or even complete runaway independence, could be extremely valuable in future distributed operations. A notional CCA takes off from a remote airstrip. Collins Aerospace capture Two different kinds of notional CCAs are depicted. One that has some very general similarities to Anduril's Fury. The other looks very much in line with Kratos' XQ-58 Valkyrie. A CCA design that General Atomics is currently working on also has a broadly similar overall configuration with a top-mounted intake and v-tail. A screen capture showing the two types of notional CCAs in the Collins Aerospace video. Collins Aerospace capture Fury and General Atomics' CCA design are currently under development as part of the first phase of the Air Force's CCA program. The Air Force, as well as the U.S. Marine Corps, have also been flying XQ-58s to support work on autonomous capabilities, as well as other research and development and test and evaluation efforts.

General Atomics/Jamie Hunter A US Marine Corps XQ-58 Valkyrie. USAF Collins' video shows two-seat F-15E Strike Eagle derivatives, F/A-18F Super Hornets, and F-35 Joint Strike Fighters as the crewed controllers for the CCAs. Both the F-15s and F/A-18Fs are notably shown carrying podded infrared search and track (IRST) systems, as well as full air-to-air combat load-outs including AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) and AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles. US Navy F/A-18F Super Hornets carrying IRST pods, AIM-120s, and AIM-9Xs, flying together with CCAs. Collins Aerospace capture The F-15s depicted in the video are some of a hybrid of real-world variants. The jets are shown with additional outboard underwing pylons currently only found in U.S. Air Force service on the F-15EX Eagle II, but lack other key features on that version. The aircraft also have 'MO' tail codes indicating jets based at Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho, where F-15E Strike Eagles are based. There are no current plans to replace the F-15Es in Idaho with EXs. Collins Aerospace capture The War Zone has repeatedly highlighted how two-seat tactical jets like the F-15EX would be particularly well suited to serving as airborne drone controllers since the individual in the back seat could handle that mission while the pilot focuses on actual flying. Back-seaters in F-15s and F/A-18Fs are seen issuing instructions to their pilotless wingmen via touchscreen interfaces on tablet-like devices. The F-35 pilots are depicted using the same user interface via the wide-area display in their jets' cockpits. The user interface that is shown provides the ability to select multiple drones at once and to direct them to perform pre-set mission profiles – including transit, defensive counter air (DCA), and combat air patrol (CAP) – at least semi-autonomously. Depictions of a tablet-based touch-screen user interface for controlling drones, as well as one utilizing the F-35's wide-area cockpit display. Collins Aerospace capture In the video, the drones are ordered first to transit to a mission area before being switched over to the DCA mode. Doing this causes the CCAs to turn on their sensors and begin scanning, at which point various threats – a mix of Flanker variants and Chinese J-20 stealth fighters – are detected. A J-20 stealth fighter seen in the Collins video. Note that the aircraft depicted here is wearing fictional national markings, but that China's People's Liberation Army is the only one to currently operate this aircraft. Collins Aerospace capture A pair of Flanker-type fighters seen in the Collins video. China also operates multiple Flanker variants and derivatives. Collins Aerospace capture One of the most commonly cited benefits of groups of drones tethered to piloted fighters in air-to-air combat is the ability of the uncrewed component to extend the sensor reach of the entire force without necessarily increasing the risks to the crewed component. For instance, CCAs could employ active sensors and pass the information they gather along to piloted fighters operating their sensor suites in a passive mode making them harder to detect. Crewed combat jets could also potentially engage enemies based on that targeting data forwarded from drone wingmen. With additional networking connectivity, the data collected by the complete crewed-uncrewed team could be pushed to other nodes, as well. Text narration in the Collins' video highlights how a human-machine team could 'collaborative search the battlespace, detecting threats building shared understanding, triangulating to generate target tracks.' It's also worth noting here that one of the key benefits of the IRST systems that the F-15s and F/A-18Fs are depicted carrying in the Collins' video is that they function passively, which also does not alert opponents to the fact that they are being tracked. IRSTs, which be paired with other sensors to provide additional capabilities, are also immune to radiofrequency electronic warfare jamming. You can read more about the value of IRSTs, which are seeing a renaissance in the U.S. military, here. The video from Collins subsequently shows U.S. fighters and CCAs engaging and shooting down a number of Chinese jets. Interestingly, the footage does not appear to depict any direct authorization being given to the drones before they fire their missiles. U.S. military officials have stressed repeatedly that, at least for the foreseeable future, a human operator somewhere 'on-the-loop' will always be responsible for authorizing uncrewed platforms in the air or anywhere else to employ lethal force. A notional CCA about to launch its AIM-120s. Collins Aerospace capture After combat concludes, the video shows different groups of CCAs being directed to maintain CAPs or return to base (RTB). As seen below, the user interface at this point in the computer-generated footage also shows what looks to be options for handing off control of the drones from the fighters to other aircraft, as well as ships and forces on the ground, and even nodes in space. The Air Force and Navy are already known to be working on ways to be able to seamlessly exchange control of CCAs in future operations. There has been talk of expanding portions of that architecture out to other branches of the U.S. military, as well as to allies and partners. Collins Aerospace capture The scenario outlined in the Collins' video is, of course, notional and, in many ways, truncated. A high-end aerial combat mission like this would likely occur across a much broader area with actual engagements occurring at beyond visual range. Notably absent entirely in the footage are hostile uncrewed combat air vehicles (UCAV) and other drones, which the Chinese aviation sector is very actively developing. When it comes to stealthy highly-autonomous flying wing UCAV, in particular, this is a space the United States has all but completely ceded to China, at least publicly.

Yang Suping/VCG via Getty Images Yang Suping/VCG via Getty Images In the video, neither side is shown leveraging their still-growing arrays of offboard air and other assets that would be involved in any operation of this kind, either. U.S. military officials have routinely cited China's growing airborne early warning and control and aerial electronic warfare capabilities as being major expected factors in any future air-to-air engagement between the two countries. A Chinese Y-9LG standoff electronic warfare aircraft, a relatively new design that shares many characteristics with the country's KJ-200 airborne early warning and control aircraft. via X What Collins' has put out still presents an interesting outlook for what highly autonomous crewed-uncrewed teaming might look like in future high-end aerial combat. It also highlights questions about concepts of operations when it comes to executing these kinds of teamed air-to-air engagements, as well as basing and sustaining CCAs, that the Air Force, as well as the Navy, are still very much working to answer. The Air Force 'has talked about potentially having as many as 1,000 of these CCAs to use in a contingency,' Gen. Kenneth Wilsbach, head of Air Combat Command, said at a talk that the Air & Space Forces Association's Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies hosted earlier this year. 'And I think that’s a noble goal, and one that would create a lot of dilemmas as people think about getting into a fight with us and having to contend with that many, plus all of our manned platforms.' At the same time, 'you probably don’t need to fly that [CCA] aircraft every day,' Wilsbach continued. 'And in fact, what we think is that we’ll have these aircraft available to fly, but they won’t fly that often. And the benefit of that is you don’t need the maintenance. You don’t need the long-term sustainment, and so you get a lot more airframes for a given amount of money.' Wilsbach added at that time that the drones would likely be kept essentially in 'flyable storage' and 'in a hangar and they’ll be ready to fly' most of the time, only being brought out when necessary. You can read more about the benefits of an operational concept like this in this past War Zone feature. Collins Aerospace capture Exactly how CCAs will be controlled and what levels of autonomy may truly be available in the near term to support all of this still very much remains to be seen, as well. 'There's a lot of opinions amongst the Air Force about the right way to go [about controlling drones from other aircraft],' John Clark, Lockheed Martin Vice President and General Manager of Advanced Development Programs (ADP), better known as Skunk Works, told The War Zone and others at this year's Air & Space Forces Association's (AFA) Air, Space & Cyber Conference earlier this week. 'The universal thought, though, is that this [a tablet or other touch-based interface] may be the fastest way to begin experimentation. It may not be the end state.' 'We're working through a spectrum of options that are the minimum invasive opportunities, as well as something that's more organically equipped, where there's not even a tablet,' Clark added. Testing to date has exposed potential issues around using tablets and other touch interface systems. 'We started with [the Air Force’s] Air Combat Command with tablets… There was this idea that they wanted to have this discreet control,' Michael Atwood, Vice President of Advanced Programs for General Atomics, said during an appearance on The Merge podcast earlier this year. 'I got to fly in one of these jets with a tablet. And it was really hard to fly the airplane, let alone the weapon system of my primary airplane, and spatially and temporally think about this other thing.' At that time, Atwood advocated for ceding greater control to drones under human supervision. An example of an actual tablet-based drone control system General Atomics has experimented with in the past. GA-ASI 'We know two things about autonomy,' Andrew Hunter, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology & Logistics, told The War Zone and other outlets at a media roundtable on the sidelines of this week's AFA conference. 'One is laws of war require us to have, you know, human engagement in key decisions involving employment of weapons and other key decisions. So we have to have that. We have to have that human engagement, the ability to do that. The second is [that] we know that our ability to create systems that can operate autonomously and do missions well is something that is still maturing.' 'So, in other words, there are things that we know that we already know how to do well with autonomy, and there's things that we know we do not know how to do well with autonomy,' Hunter continued. 'So we're going to stick to the things we know we can do well, and then have humans do the other things, and, over time, that mix is going to change&#8230; it's not going to be static.' With the Air Force pushing hard to begin fielding its first operational CCAs by the end of the decade, it should become increasingly clear in the coming years how well Collins' vision does or doesn't align with reality.

Israeli Airstrikes In Lebanon Intensify	Israel has launched its most intense airstrikes on Lebanon since the start of the Gaza war almost a year ago. The raids, launched by Israeli Air Force (IAF) aircraft late on Thursday, and centered upon southern Lebanon and Beirut, follow the unprecedented series of explosions targeting electronic devices belonging to Hezbollah members in that country, earlier this week. Israel claims that a significant number of leading Hezbollah commanders were killed in an airstrike on Beirut today. As more members of the international community call upon both sides for restraint, Israel and Hezbollah appear closer to all-out war than they have been at any point in the last 12 months or so. People gather in front of a building targeted by an Israeli strike in Beirut's southern suburbs on September 20, 2024. The strike on Hezbollah's stronghold in Lebanon's capital Beirut reportedly killed at least eight people and wounded dozens of others, with a source close to the movement saying a top military leader was dead. (Photo by AFP) - IAF jets also conducted at least one raid on Beirut this afternoon, killing at least one top Hezbollah commander in what was described by the Israeli Ministry of Defense as a 'precision strike.'

The airstrikes followed attacks earlier this week that have been widely attributed to Israel and which left 37 people dead and around 3,000 injured after explosives were triggered in Hezbollah pagers (on Tuesday) and walkie-talkies (Wednesday). Meanwhile, Hezbollah has launched over a hundred rockets against targets in Israel today. According to the Associated Press, around 140 rockets were fired from Lebanon across the border.

Nasrallah said Hezbollah hoped Israeli troops would enter southern Lebanon, providing the militant group with an 'historic opportunity' to take them on in battle. Israel will face 'a crushing response from the Axis of Resistance,' Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Commander Hossein Salami said yesterday, according to state media. Iran is the major military backer of Hezbollah, while the Axis of Resistance refers to other Iran-aligned militant groups including Hamas, the Houthis in Yemen, and various armed groups in Iraq and Syria. Today, the Iranian Embassy in Lebanon also directly condemned the airstrike in Beirut, describing it as 'Israeli madness and arrogance.' In a post on X, the Iranian Embassy wrote: 'In the strongest terms the Israeli madness and arrogance that crossed all limits by targeting residential areas in the southern suburbs of Beirut… We reaffirm once again that such terrorist crimes will not undermine the determination and faith of the Lebanese.

However, with both sides continuing to launch attacks on each other’s territory, and Israel stepping up its offensive, the prospect of some kind of diplomatic solution, which Washington has pushed for, looks less likely.

A Peak Into The Future Of Offensive Electronic Warfare	Electronic warfare (EW) has taken on new prominence as the threat from near-peer adversaries has ballooned in recent. Who can best dominate the radio frequency spectrum and take the electronic fight directly to the enemy will have a massive advantage in tomorrow battles. To find out more about the state of play in offensive EW, we sat down with Chuck Angus, director of business development in Naval Power at Raytheon. He oversees the company's cutting-edge offensive electronic warfare (EW) portfolio. Angus talked with The War Zone about the latest in offensive EW, his company's new AN/ALQ-249(V)1 Next Generation Jammer-Mid Band (NGJ-MB) electronic warfare pods (currently installed on EA-18G Growlers aboard the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln) and the applicability of such systems on sixth-generation fighters and loyal wingman drones. This conversation, which took place on the sidelines of the Air & Space Forces Air, Space & Cyber conference in National Harbor, Maryland, has been slightly edited for clarity. The AN/ALQ-249(V)1 Next Generation Jammer-Mid Band (NGJ-MB). (Raytheon) Q: Talk about how electronically scanned array (AESA) antennas like those on the NGJ will improve offensive EW. A: What’s interesting is that AESA arrays can do lots of things differently than some of the steerable arrays that we had. So essentially, the AESAs, based on their field of regard, can do a lot of things in a lot of places simultaneously, and so you think about electronic attack systems like NGJ, where we've got eight AESA arrays from that, for those, for that shipset, from those two pods. And it can do a lot of things for a large breadth of area. An exploded view of the components inside Raytheon’s NGJ-MB pod. (USN) If we talk about electronic attack per se, the way those arrays are set up, the way it was designed, is that, is that I can attack an adversary out the front and the side, and then as I'm ingressing. Once I egress, that system, working together, can move those assignments from one set of arrays, from the front to the back, from the left pod to the right pod. The point of it is, is that when you have that multifunctioning array, and you have some autonomy that goes with it, you can move those assignments or jobs or whatever it's going to be doing, whether it's comms or delivering payloads or whatever it is, it can do it around that platform, even while it's making a turn. So I think it's really, really important. And fire control radar, is the same way, right? So now you got a fire control radar, and you've got a sensor and stuff, and if you get them all fused together, I think that that's a very valuable contribution. (You can read all about what multi-function AESA arrays distributed around an aircraft are capable of in this past special feature of ours.) NAVAIR Q: What kind of effects can next-generation EW have on adversary systems? Can it destroy radar seekers on incoming missiles, for instance? A; I'll talk about offensive electronic attack, because that's distinguishing it from self-protect, right? So as an example, what you're really trying to do is protect a protected entity with another entity. So, as an example, a Growler flying in formation with a [F/A-18] Super Hornet, right? The Growler is not protecting itself. That's not what it's about. It's protecting the Super Hornets flying out in front of it. And so it's protecting that Super Hornet by denying that adversary radar from detecting it so it can drive in closer and drop its weapons right again when you ingress and egress, you can stay on that target at the same time. So not only is it reducing the detection range of a platform that's dropping weapons, it's also protecting that platform against an air-to-air threat. So maybe it's a Chinese fighter or a Russian fighter. If you can reduce that fighter's ability to see you, you get a chance to shoot first. Great combat advantage. The other thing, I think it's really important, is when we talk about magazine depth, and everybody's interested in 'how many weapons do I have?' So again, if you can reduce that adversary radar from seeing that weapon that’s inbound until it gets really, really close, then you're going to improve that capability to attack that target, support those weapons all the way to target, reducing the amount of weapons you have to fire, right? And, by definition, increasing your magazine depth. A VAQ-133 EA-18G with NGJ-MB pods lands on board the USS Abraham Lincoln. (USN ) Q: Can it affect inbound air-to-air missiles? A: I probably can't talk much about that. I'll say it this way, if a weapon was using a radar and you had the ability to affect a radar, I could imagine that there may be some effect. Q: What about distributing EW to platforms across the battlespace and connecting them for cooperative EW via networking? How far along is this and what are the advantages? A: Certainly a lot of advantages. And I think the advantages, besides the fact that the guy over here can send an assignment hundreds of miles away, and get something done over there, that's an incredible advantage. I think the ability to team them together on a specific target would also be an advantage. One of the things that we talk about in electronic attack is the ability to do simultaneous targets, multiple simultaneous targets, with multiple techniques. So the ability to attack this target while the same time attacking another target from the same AESA array that you've that you've divided. That’s the idea behind the AEASs. You don't have to turn it. You can divide it and split that beam. So not only can you attack multiple simultaneous targets, but you can also move from one to the other really, really quick. And I think that's one of the great benefits of something like an electronic attack that you can move quickly so sometimes that threat radar may not even know that you've left it and gone to something else. So imagine multiplying that capability across the board. It doesn't have to be a small platform. It can be much larger platforms. It can be multiple types of aircraft, bombers, fighters, maritime patrol, UAS, and mobility aircraft, right? That whole thing can enable that joint fight. And it's not just about the capability, it's about the capacity. That was your point. Your point was, ‘how can I increase the capacity?’ Then working together. That's what you're doing. You're increasing the capacity. A graphic giving a very general look at different jamming mission profiles, with the EA-18G seen here providing so-called 'modified escort jamming' from outside the range of enemy ground-based air defenses. The NGJ-MB pods are capable of supporting other profiles, as well. (GAO) Q: Are you looking at cognitive electronic warfare on this? A: ​​So that's important, and we have been looking at it, but I can't really discuss the work that's going on. Q: What can EW do as far as making things appear to the enemy that are not there? A: So the nice thing about having a software-defined radio is that any equation that can be built in MATLAB [a programming platform designed specifically for engineers and scientists to analyze and design systems and products], you can project. So you can imagine that you could do a lot of things with RF energy. I can't talk about some other things that it can go do. But certainly, there are a lot of effects that you can do with AESA arrays and different techniques. Q: What do you think EW will look like on a Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) sixth-gen fighter or a collaborative combat aircraft (CCA)? A: Well, I understand that there are still some requirements generation going on about what those missions are, but it's clear to me that electronic attack is an enabler. It has to have a position as part of that, right? Is it high-powered? That's a great question. It probably depends on the platform. Right? Is it going to be very directed, is it going to be attritable? Because it’s a question about what that solution is. Could it be carried in a pod? It could be carried in a pod. It would be a small pod, but I still think you have to have power generation capability, because some of these platforms are maybe power starved anyway. A model of General Atomics’ CCA design on display at the AFA conference this week. Jamie Hunter Q: That sounds like a difficult challenge. A: It is a difficult challenge and that's why you see something like an NGJ, which has its own power system. Because once it's airborne, it doesn't need any power from the airplane. It has its own. NGJ has a ram air turbine generator. It has doors on both sides that open up when it's airborne, and it takes the air through those doors, turns a turbine and generates 82 kW. Q: Would some version of the NGJ fit in a CCA at some point? Is it something you're considering looking at? A: I think the market is heading towards smaller form factor, as you're describing. So I think there's opportunity there. Q: Is that something you are actually pursuing? A: We've been investing in a smaller form factor. I can't just tell you who've been working with on it, but you know, NGJ is 14 feet, 1,200 pounds. Depending on the size of the platform, you may have to have something smaller. (Raytheon) Q: Can you talk about what kind of platform? Crewed? Uncrewed? A: I think both, there's no reason why you couldn't do it. NGJ in itself is pretty autonomous, especially if you've done the mission plan. A lot of those assignments are mission-planned, so you really don't need any operator intervention. And we don't talk about managing the assignments anymore. It's not like the guy in the back is [doing] pushing-the-buttons kind of stuff. What we're doing is managing the priorities of those assignments. So if it's that radar you want to go after, that's a higher priority than this other one. So mission-plan the priority of those assignments, and It'll prosecute those targets autonomously. Q: Has NGJ achieved initial operational capability (IOC) yet? A: You'll have to talk to the Navy about IOC and deployment. What I can tell you is that we're delivering pods to the Navy. Operational testing has gone extremely well. Q: When was the operational test? A: Well, I think there's still some pieces of it ongoing. But performance has been very, very good. Q: Have you gotten any feedback or lessons learned from that [deployment on an operational cruise]? A: Just like any new weapon system, I think when you put it in the hands of the operator, you learn something because those guys are smarter than you and I both. And they find new ways to use things. I think every day we learn something from operational tests, developmental tests, because the guys are actually putting it through its paces. Q: But have you gotten any feedback from the Lincoln, which arrived with the pods in the U.S. Central Command region last month? A: I can't tell you what they're doing operationally and where they are. What I can tell you is that we have field service representatives who support the squadrons. And we get feedback. A VAQ-133 Growler assigned to the USS Abraham Lincoln with AN/ALQ-249(V)1 Next Generation Jammer-Mid Band (NGJ-MB) pods under its wings. (USN) Q: Has anything that's happened on Lincoln come back to you to figure out how to make things better? A: We get all kinds of feedback from the Navy. Okay? I just can't describe where it is. So I think what you're starting to hear around is that everybody loves the Growler and NGJ. But there are only so many Growlers and so many NGJs, right? You can put this on the non-traditional EW platforms, the bombers, the fighters, maritime patrol, UAS… Q: Tankers? A: Tankers. You can put it on those, and you can automatically increase the EA capacity in the fight. And the other thing, and I'll mention quickly, is that if you put it on a bomber whose primary mission is to shoot weapons, that's what they're there for, they're going to drop weapons. So that non-kinetic effect of electronic attack is an enabler…it increases the capability of that kinetic effect, right? It's really interesting working them together like that, and it's something we hadn't talked about. And again, increasing the magazine depth. Q: Where are the adversaries like China and Russia on offensive EW? Can you say what you might be learning from them? A: I think we learn from them every day. And then some things we learned that maybe we've known, and some things that we probably didn't understand at the time, but I think it's a very interesting threat landscape right now. And my belief is that electronic attack is one of those disruptive technologies and capabilities that's really needed to prosecute the war, whether it's in the South China Sea, or there's [U.S. European Command] EUCOM and support with NATO wherever. I think it's an incredible enabler. Revolutionary change. Q: How would you rate China’s capabilities in terms of offensive EW? For instance, its Y-9LG electronic warfare aircraft recently took part in military drills with Thailand. A: I don’t think there's anything like what we have in the inventory. But clearly they have - like everybody else - they've moved the ball rather quickly on EW. Everybody has because technology is getting better. So they're not doing the scanning antennas anymore, right? They're doing something different. They're using GaN [Gallium Nitride] in places, right? So I think it's really, really important. It is believed that China's Y-9LG jammer aircraft uses its powerful electronically scanned radar beams to suppress enemy radar signals. (Via Twitter) via X Q: How about the Russians? Can you assess their offensive EW capabilities? A: I really can't, I can just tell you that, just like the Chinese - and everybody - they’ve advanced their EW capabilities. Q: This is an Air Force trade show. Talk about how putting NGJ on Navy Growlers helps the Air Force. A: The [non-recurring engineering] NRE [cost] is done for NGJ, essentially, right? The DoD spent $3 billion, probably a little more than that, over all the NRE. So a service or a country could essentially pick that system up as it is and be able to use it. You'll need to do some integration, that kind of stuff. But certainly, all the heavy lifting has been done. So there's opportunity there, and of course, you drive the cost down. The other piece that we're investing in, and the Navy's investing in, is our production facility in Forest, Mississippi, where we're now increasing the capability to test faster, to develop faster, and to produce it quicker. End of interview. Despite its importance, EW overall hasn't historically received the budgetary support some U.S. military leaders say it deserves, a point Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall drove home during his keynote speech at the AFA conference. 'We started looking closely at electronic warfare for several reasons,' he said. 'First of all, we thought it was a key enabler in almost every one of our operating barriers. Second, most of our electronic warfare programs are platform-centered, so there was a unifying focus on this area as a whole. My own experience suggested that this is a historically neglected area that can be that can have an oversized impact, but doesn't compete well with our internal budget values relative to other priorities. We established cross-cutting operational neighborhood structure in this area try to bring more focused and conscious consideration to electronic warfare.' Whether Kendall can match his support for robust EW with commensurate funding is something we will watch closely. There has been growing chatter about the F-15EX getting Next Generation Jamming pods to tie into its extremely advanced electronic warfare system, but that hasn't been formalized at this time. There are significant investments being made in the new EQ-37 Compass Call fleet as well as updating the electronic warfare systems on existing fighters. The biggest leap may come with the F-35 Block IV, which will have an EW system that is touted as the most important aspect of the Block IV upgrade. All these elements and more could contribute to a new distributed EW strategy for the USAF that will only be bolstered by CCAs, new air-launched effects weapons and aircraft like the NGAD fighter and B-21 Raider. Clearly other developments are also happening in the classified realm. But considering the threat posed by China and Russia's own growing EW capabilities, more funds flowing toward controlling the radio frequency spectrum are more likely than not.

Collaborative Combat Aircraft Program 'Ingesting' Modular Chassis...	The U.S. Air Force says the once-secretive Off-Board Sensing Station (OBSS) drone program has been fully folded into the service's Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) effort. General Atomics has already disclosed that its current CCA design is derived from the XQ-67 drone it developed for OBSS. The Air Force and General Atomics have done pioneering work on the idea of accelerating the development and production of different kinds of drones by using a common core 'chassis' that includes landing gear and critical mission and flight control computer systems through OBSS. It is now hoped that these concepts will be beneficial to future tranches of CCAs. The XQ-67A during its first flight on February 28, 2024. Courtesy photo via USAF Air Force officials offered new details about the relationship between the OBSS and CCA programs, as well as the earlier Low Cost Attritable Aircraft Platform Sharing (LCAAPS) effort, at the Air & Space Forces Association's (AFA) main annual conference just outside of Washington, D.C., earlier this week. A model of General Atomics' CCA design on display at the AFA conference this week. Jamie Hunter '[Speaking] from the [Air Force] Test Center [AFTC] perspective, but also having some experience with the Lab [the Air Force Research Laboratory; AFRL], we went through a long process of developing that technology,' Air Force Maj. Gen. Scott Cain told The War Zone and others at a media roundtable on the sidelines of the AFA conference yesterday. 'Our steps that we took &#8230; were proving out that system [the XQ-67] and making sure that it got through that first flight and airworthiness. And now that has been picked up &#8230; that program, OBSS, &#8230; did a seamless transition over to the CCA program.' Maj. Gen. Cain is the current head of AFTC and was previously in charge of AFRL. The XQ-67 broke cover in February, as The War Zone was first to report, and the drone took the skies for the first time later that month. In February, AFRL also presented the first real public chronology of how it arrived at OBSS, as you can read more about here. Simply put, a direct line flows from the Low Cost Attritable Aircraft Technologies (LCAAT) initiative, which kicked off in 2014, to LCAAPS in 2018, and then to OBSS in 2021. An explicit link from OBSS to CCA was not drawn at that time. CCA is leveraging other efforts, past and present, including the Air Force's Skyborg project, as well. LCAAT also separately led to the Low Cost Attritable Strike Demonstrator (LCASD) project under which the Air Force acquired its first example of the Kratos XQ-58 Valkyrie drone. At least a concept for an armed, higher-performance companion to the OBSS 'sensor truck' drone, called the Off-Board Weapons Station (OBWS), also exists. It is unknown whether or not an actual uncrewed aircraft is being developed, or already has been, as part of the exploration of OBWS. A key element of both OBSS and OBWS, and the overarching LCAAPs effort, was the idea of very modular designs using a high degree of common physical architecture. The Air Force and General Atomics have since described the idea of a common core as a 'genus' from which multiple 'species' of very differently configured drones can be created. Ahead of the AFA conference, AFRL put out the video below about LCAAPS and its underlying philosophy. 'So the Test Center supported the Lab in getting XQ-67 to that first flight and to do some early characterization of the platform,' Maj. Gen. Cain added at the roundtable yesterday. 'There are other lessons from this about building a common chassis that will be carried forward. And the CCA program is ingesting those and thinking about those for future increments of the system.' The CCA program is structured around relatively rapid iterative development cycles. General Atomics and Anduril are currently developing designs as part of the first cycle, or Increment One. The Air Force is also in the process of finalizing requirements for Increment Two. A model of Anduril's Fury drone, which it is now developing under the CCA program, that was shown at the AFA conference this week. Jamie Hunter As already noted, General Atomics has confirmed that its Increment One CCA is based on the XQ-67. The company is also now marketing an entire family of drones called Gambit that leverage a common core chassis. 'There's an [XQ-67] OBSS down there [on the AFA show floor]. &#8230; There's also [model of] a General Atomics CCA offering down there,' Air Force Gen. Duke Richardson, head of Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC), said at the same media roundtable yesterday as Maj. Gen. Cain. 'So they might be similar, but they're not exact. So if you look at them closely, they're not exact. So we definitely learned a lot from the XQ-67.' That OBSS and CCA are directly linked at a programmatic level is not surprising. In February, The War Zone highlighted the similarities in language being used to describe key elements of both programs, as how well the then newly disclosed OBWS concept seemed to align with the Air Force's CCA plans, writing: 'Overall, OBSS looks more and more like it is at least a related exploratory effort running in parallel to the CCA program, and one that could be a key stepping stone for the latter to achieve its ambitious goals. The potential existence of an armed, higher-performance drone developed under OBWS, or at least the exploration of such a design, would also align with the CCA effort.' Interestingly, Michael Atwood, Vice President of Advanced Programs for General Atomics, described the company's CCA entry 'as more of a weapons station' to the XQ-67's 'sensor station in an exclusive interview with The War Zone from the AFA convention floor, which you can find here. A graphical depiction of the core 'genus/species' concept behind LCAAPS and, by extension, OBSS. USAF capture The Air Force's confirmation now of an explicit link between OBSS, and by extension LCAAPS, and CCA is still significant and raises new and interesting questions about how this focus may impact the latter program. The Air Force has already made clear that, win or lose, contractors can compete in as many increments of the program as they want. In addition, the service has said that companies not selected to develop CCA designs could still get contracts to actually build them in order to help meet its ambitious production and fielding timelines. Even having contractors utilize a centralized pool of components to some degree could help further accelerate these schedules, while also helping to reduce costs and streamline supply chains for sustainment down the road. It isn't clear what advantages the CCA program directly leveraging OBSS could provide to General Atomics. The Air Force does have a clear interest in the modular chassis approach that General Atomics has now done significant risk reduction prototyping on with the XQ-67, which is still being very actively tested. The XQ-67 on the ground. USAF Courtesy photo via USAF The hope currently is that General Atomics and Anduril will have their Increment One designs flying by the end of the end of next year, if not well before then, and that the first operational CCAs will enter service before the end of the decade. Increment Two is supposed to kick off next year, as well. 'So what should Increment 2 be? Do not assume and it may not be just an evolution of Increment 1. It could be an entirely different set of missions. Could be [an] entirely different kind of an aircraft,' Andrew Hunter, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology & Logistics, had said at the 2024 Defense News Conference earlier this month. 'And so part of that initial work is, again, starting with a large vendor pool, what are the good ideas out there? We’ll have some ideas [about] what we think Increment 2 needs to do as part of a broader force, and that’s part of this broader look at air dominance and how we’re going to deliver that.' With what we know now, whatever CCAs the Air Force chooses to buy under any increment of the program could well look very different outwardly, but be much more similar inside than meets the eye.

How Israel Turned Hezbollah’s Pagers Into Exploding Trojan Horses	Details are starting to come to light about how Israel apparently orchestrated two days of coordinated explosions targeting thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah in Lebanon. You can read our reporting of the first wave of explosions here, and the second wave here. At this point, it’s worth remembering that Israel has not admitted responsibility for the blasts, but it is now widely acknowledged that was behind them. Moreover, as we have discussed before, it would be entirely in keeping with what appears to be a developing plan for a full-scale military operation launched against Hezbollah. Addressing the first wave of explosions, on Tuesday, this targeted pagers used by Hezbollah. At 3:30 p.m. local time, it seems the pagers were triggered simultaneously, by a specific message. The message was one that looks, at least, as if it was sent by Hezbollah leadership. A communication device on the ground as the Lebanese Army prepares to destroy it in a controlled explosion, in southern Lebanon between the villages of Burj al Muluk and Klayaa, on September 19, 2024. Photo by Rabih DAHER / AFP RABIH DAHER This suggests a modification of the software in the pager that in turn triggered an explosion. However, based on eyewitness accounts, the pagers didn’t explode immediately after the message arrived, but with a slight delay. A bleep and then a pause would give time for the device to be picked up and even brought closer to the face of whoever owned it. This would correspond with reports of multiple hand and facial injuries among those targeted. Modifying the pagers to respond in a specific way to a particular message is one thing, but then there’s the fact that each seems to have contained a small amount of explosive. The physical sabotage of the devices would also have required this explosive to be added, although not necessarily much. Even a few grams of explosive would likely be enough to inflict life-changing injuries. All of this put together indicates a very elaborate operation to get appropriately sabotaged pagers into Hezbollah’s hands. According to an investigation by The Guardian newspaper, the pagers were AR-924 models from a Taiwanese manufacturer, Gold Apollo. The Taiwanese firm has since said that the manufacture of these devices was carried out by a subcontractor, BAC Consulting, which is based in Hungary, but which bears all the hallmarks of a front company. The related deal was apparently signed three years ago. CEO of Gold Apollo, Hsu Ching-Kuang denied manufacturing the explosive pager. When asked abt AR-924, he said 'it is produced & sold by BAC…we only provide brand trademark authorisation & have no involvement in design or manufacturing of this product.' See my exchange w him. pic.twitter.com/eb6k65oyKl&mdash; Tingting Liu 劉亭廷 (@tingtingliuTVBS) September 18, 2024 The exact status of BAC Consulting is something of a mystery, with its website having gone offline yesterday. Its chief executive, Cristiana Bársony-Arcidiacono, confirmed to NBC that her company had links to Gold Apollo, but that BAC Consulting was 'just the intermediate.' Hungarian officials have also said the pagers were not made in Hungary. Israel didn’t intercept the pagers. It built a fake company and manufactured the pagers themselves. Imagine the paranoia that must be running through Hezbollah now. If Israel can do this, what it can it do in a war? No wonder they’re so afraid to escalate. pic.twitter.com/LgaRuPa0Gu&mdash; Richard Hanania (@RichardHanania) September 19, 2024 Wherever the modified pagers were produced, they were fitted with an explosive device and the requisite software and then supplied to Hezbollah — this is perhaps the most remarkable part of the story. The implication is that Israeli intelligence knew that the militant group was in the market for a large quantity of pagers — around 5,000. Ironically, the acquisition of the devices had been encouraged by the group’s leadership since pagers were deemed to be safer than mobile phones. Israel, therefore, became aware of Hezbollah’s demand for pagers and then managed the entire production and delivery process — including a plausible-looking supply chain — to ensure that they were distributed and that the entire plan remained a closely guarded secret. In the time between the devices having been issued to Hezbollah and the explosions this week, the fact that they were used for encrypted communications means that Israel was also very likely reading all their traffic and reaping a significant intelligence windfall. A photo taken on September 18, 2024, in Beirut's southern suburbs, shows the remains of exploded pagers on display at an undisclosed location. Photo by AFP - The second wave of explosions, on Wednesday, targeted walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah. Fewer details have emerged about these, but it seems highly likely that the devices were tampered with and distributed in a similar way. The results, however, are beyond doubt. The blasts on Tuesday killed 12 and injured up to 2,800 more, while those on Wednesday killed 14 and left more than 450 more injured. Just as importantly for Israel, the explosions created chaos and confusion, stripping Hezbollah of secure communications and eroding its chain of command. A review of operational security within the group will also have tied up further resources and caused yet more disruption. There have also been other effects, including the announcement today that Qatar Airways would refuse to allow passengers to bring pagers or walkie-talkies onto its flights. Effective immediately: Following the directive received from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation of the Republic of Lebanon, all passengers flying from Beirut Rafic Harirl International Airport (BEY) are prohibited from carrying pagers and walkie-talkies on board flights.…&mdash; Qatar Airways (@qatarairways) September 19, 2024 Interestingly, there are suggestions that Israel may have rushed the operation amid fears that it was about to get compromised. Unnamed U.S. officials apparently told Axios that the decision to trigger the devices this week was made due to concerns that Hezbollah was poised to uncover the nature of the plot. 'It was a use it or lose it moment,' one U.S. official told Axios. As can be easily imagined, the terrifying nature of electronic devices exploding on command has also resulted in a general panic among the population in Lebanon. There have been reports of other electronic items exploding, including solar power systems and fingerprint readers, although there has been no independent confirmation of devices other than pagers and walkie-talkies having been affected. Photos of damaged and burned iPhones have appeared on social media. At least some of these have been debunked, but they do show the degree to which the population is now fearing what might happen next.

The weaponization of electronic devices in this way has caused alarm, with the monitoring group Human Rights Watch noting that it contravenes human rights law, which specifically 'prohibits the use of booby traps … precisely to avoid putting civilians at grave risk.' This also raises the prospect of similar kinds of booby-trapped devices being utilized by non-state actors in the future. The possibility of a terror campaign making use of modified electronic devices sold in public online marketplaces is a very worrying one, and one that could exploit loopholes in existing supply chains to create widespread disruption. With the exploding pagers/electronics operation precedent, and considering how many crappy electronic devices from questionable vendors are sold on Amazon etc. it is worrying. A bad actor could hurt a lot of random people and cause a ton of havoc and disruption.&mdash; Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) September 19, 2024 You have an international delivery/distribution system and ability to communicate with the device out of the box.&mdash; Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) September 19, 2024 While the explosions may have been unprecedented in terms of scale, Israel has previously assassinated key figures using broadly similar methods. In 1996, Yahya Ayyash, the chief bombmaker of Hamas, was killed by an exploding cell phone. The device had been given to him by Israeli intelligence, who used it to eavesdrop on his conversations, before triggering a fatal explosion. The series of explosions this week came as a surprise, but there are also reports that the Israeli Minister of Defense, Yoav Gallant, called his U.S. counterpart Lloyd Austin only minutes before the first wave of blasts, alerting him to the fact that an operation in Lebanon was about to begin. The call falls short of a public acknowledgment of responsibility, and it seems that no specifics of the operation were revealed to Austin. Undoubtedly, the explosions have had a significant impact on Hezbollah and Lebanon, but the long-term results remain to be seen. For its part, Hezbollah has promised to avenge the attacks of the last two days. Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s leader, today threatened Israel with 'tough retribution and just punishment' and that this would happen 'where it expects it and where it does not.'

However, with the unprecedented explosions across Lebanon this week, Israel has laid down a significant marker of the lengths it is willing to go to tackle the militant group, using all means at its disposal.

AC-130J Ghostrider Gunships Will Keep Their 105mm Howitzers, For ...	The U.S. Air Force's top special operations officer says AC-130J Ghostrider gunships will continue being armed with 105mm howitzers for the time being, though this could still change in future. The service had been considering removing these weapons from the AC-130Js amid a growing debate about the relevance of the gunships in future high-end conflicts, such as one in the Pacific against China. Air Force Lt. Gen. Michael Conley, head of Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), talked about current and future plans for the AC-130Js with The War Zone and others at a media roundtable yesterday. The gathering came on the last day of the Air & Space Forces Association's 2024 Air, Space & Cyber Conference just outside Washington, D.C. An AC-130J Ghostrider. USAF 'The 105[mm howitzer] will continue to be relevant,' Conley said. 'The plan is to keep using that in the years to come.' AFSOC has some 31 AC-130Js in inventory, which are the only AC-130 variants now in service. The Ghostrider's current armament package includes a 105mm howitzer, as well as a single barrel 30mm GAU-23/A Bushmaster II automatic cannon. The gunships can also employ an array of precision-guided missiles and bombs via Common Launch Tubes (CLT) and underwing racks. You can learn more about how the Air Force AC-130s have evolved since the introduction of the original AC-130A version in the 1960s here and in The War Zone video below. Operational Ghostriders were initially delivered to AFSOC armed with modified versions of the 105mm M102 howitzer, a weapon that had been found on multiple preceding AC-130 variants dating back to the Vietnam War. The M102 was originally developed during the Cold War as a light towed artillery piece for the U.S. Army, which retired the last of its examples in the early 2000s. An AC-130J armed with a modified 105mm M102 howitzer. USAF A close-up look at the 105mm howitzer on an AC-130J. USAF With the M102s becoming increasingly unsupportable, the Air Force, in cooperation with the U.S. Navy, had begun acquiring improved 105mm howitzers for the AC-130J. As of November 2023, 17 Ghostriders had received replacement howitzers, referred to at the time by the interim nomenclature GAU-XX. At that time, however, AFSOC had also confirmed to The War Zone that further integrations had been put on hold 'pending the results of the assessment of capabilities of the AC-130J.' A look at the improved GAU-XX howitzer on an AC-130J at Yokota Air Base in Japan during an exercise in 2022. USAF Separate plans to arm a Ghostrider with a laser directed energy weapon, which had previously been described as ideally suited for use in counter-terrorism and other lower-intensity operations, were also notably scrapped last year. The War Zone has now reached back out to AFSOC about whether the GAU-XX integrations have resumed, how many AC-130Js now have the improved howitzers, and for other additional information. Speaking at the roundtable yesterday, Lt. Gen. Conley did acknowledge that there could be less emphasis on the 105mm howitzers when employing AC-130Js in a future high-end fight. 'As we look through our training portfolios and what we need to do for future fights, it probably involves less of the 105mm,' Conley said. 'It's got munitions that could sink a ship, &#8230; not a capital ship, not a carrier, but it could do damage to smaller ships.' 'In a peer fight, I think our spot is probably on the periphery,' he added. 'It [AC-130Js] could harass outlying [enemy] forces.' 'What the gunship's known for, in many cases, with our ground partners, is just the sound of freedom overhead and knowing that someone's there watching them,' Conley continued. The AFSOC commander's comments here followed the rare appearance of an AC-130J at a sinking exercise (SINKEX) in the Pacific in July. The SINKEX in question, where various assets were used to send the ex-USS Dubuque, a decommissioned U.S. Navy Austin class amphibious warfare ship, to the bottom of the ocean was part of the larger biennial Rim Of The Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise, which you can read more about here. At that time, The War Zone highlighted very similar kinds of potential roles and missions for AC-130Js, as well as challenges those aircraft would face, in a future major conflict, writing: 'During a future major conflict, just getting within gun range of a higher-value target like an amphibious warfare ship, likely operating as part of a larger group of warships further supported by air and other assets, would be a very tall order, if not impossible, for Air Force AC-130s. Ghostriders might still be able to leverage their guns against vessels in lower-risk areas or to help finish off severely damaged vessels separated from their companions. Armed overwatch over and around friendly forces on islands and anchorages could be another future maritime mission in a higher-end fight. It is worth noting that even during operations in largely permissive airspace over countries like Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan in the past 20 years or so, AC-130s have almost exclusively operated at night in large part to help reduce their vulnerability to potential threats.' 'We're looking at options for improved radars [and] other things that a traditional AC-130 would not have been asked to do,' Lt. Gen. Conley noted yesterday. The Air Force and U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) have a stated interest in adding new active electronically-scanned array (AESA) radars to the Ghostriders. These would give the aircraft important new targeting, threat warning, and potentially even electronic warfare capabilities, along with giving their crews generally improved situational awareness. AC-130Js already have a substantial and still-growing self-protection electronic warfare suite. Adding smaller and lower-cost cruise missiles to the AC-130J's arsenal to significantly increase its ability to launch stand-off strikes further away from enemy defenses is also increasingly on the horizon. Lt. Gen. Conley separately highlighted yesterday how AFSOC has been experimenting with using its MC-130 special operations tanker/transports as stand-off strike platforms using the Rapid Dragon palletized munitions system. AFSOC is looking to increasingly utilize autonomous capabilities, supported by advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, across all of its aircraft fleets and that could also impact how AC-130Js are employed in the future. 'I'd say [what] we're looking at in AFSOC &#8230; is an incremental approach, where what I am asking industry and my team to get after is, what are the things we can do inside the plane right now that allow the aircrew to focus on mission things and not the mechanics of flying an aircraft,' Lt. Gen. Conley said yesterday. 'So how do you fully automate [aircraft] startup and all that stuff where you hit a button and everything does it versus reading the old school checklist back and forth. The next step of that would be, okay, is there a point that we could reduce a crew member?' 'I think there's also an autonomy piece in our mission side, where &#8230; like with our [AC-130] gunship, you know, what can we do, as far as sensors and targeting to use the technology that's out there and getting better to help us with target identification, and kind of take the human out of the loop and put him or her on the loop,' he added. The head of AFSOC also repeatedly stressed that, while the U.S. military's primary focus is shifting to preparing for future high-end conflicts, the special operations community in particular remains heavily engaged in lower-intensity operations globally. Those missions, in turn, mean a need is still seen for the traditional capabilities that the AC-130 offers. This reality is also impacting discussions about plans for the planned fleet of OA-1K light attack aircraft, which are facing the same kinds of questions about future relevance as the Ghostriders. One of the Air Tractor AT-802U aircraft now being used to train Air Force pilots ahead of the delivery of the first OA-1K aircraft. The OA-1K is a derivative of the AT-802U. U.S. Air National Guard 'From when OA-1K was conceptualized and decided on until now, the world's changed a little bit. And so we look at some different opportunities with it. I think it still provides a cost-effective close air support platform, which is one of the missions that it was designed for. It's still going to provide an ISR [intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance] capability,' Conley explained. 'But as we move forward, I think there's opportunity to look at, again, some novel mission sets. &#8230;how quick can we get the wings on and off it so we could use it in some sort of crisis response, if we needed to? Where does the role of SIGINT, or ELINT or&#8230; some sort of ISR collect [factor in] there. I think there's opportunity for that. Again, not anything we've committed to yet.' Conley added that AFSOC's requirement currently remains for a fleet of 75 OA-1Ks despite discussions about potentially truncating those purchases. All this being said, AFSOC is clearly at a watershed moment in its history, as is the rest of the U.S. special operations community, after spending the bulk of the last two decades focused almost exclusively on counter-terrorism, counter-insurgency, and other lower-intensity operations. Plans for the AC-130J's future armament and other capabilities, as well as the gunship's expected roles and missions, are continuing to evolve as eyes turn to future high-end fights. In the meantime, at least, the Ghostriders will continue to wield their 105mm howitzers. Howard Altman contributed to this story.

B-21 Ground Test Airframes Join Flying Pre-Production Raider	The U.S. Air Force and Northrop Grumman have expanded testing of the B-21 thanks to two ground test articles, which are being used to evaluate the bomber's core construction and the time it takes before certain parts break. The tempo of flight testing of the initial pre-production Raider is also growing, with the jet now sometimes taking to the skies twice a week. The Air Force is otherwise continuing to lay the groundwork for fielding the first operation B-21s toward the end of the decade. The Air & Space Forces Association hosted a panel on the B-21 today as part of its main annual conference just out of Washington, D.C. Air Force Gen. Thomas Bussiere, head of Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), and Maj. Gen. Jason Armagost, the commander of Eighth Air Force, along with William 'Elvis' Bailey, the Director and Program Executive Officer of the Air Force's Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO), and Tom Jones, President of Northrop Grumman's Aeronautics Systems sector, offered updates about the Raider. The Air Force also released new official flight test footage of the B-21, seen below, alongside the panel discussion. 'We've completed structures testing for our first ground test vehicle,' RCO head Bailey announced. 'Now, what really we were doing there was proving out the structure, you know, of the platform, and also, at the same time, too, validating that digital model that we've been working on throughout – trying to understand analytically how the aircraft's going to perform, then testing it and testing it physically, then going back to that model.' The structural ground test article is also referred to as G-1. 'We're doing fatigue testing on another ground model, as well, and we'll be getting into, you know, how does the aircraft age over time,' Bailey continued. 'It's just not as flashy as the flight test crowd is, however, if you intend to build a lot of these and operate them for a long time this is very important work.' When it comes to the first flying B-21, or T-1, 'we're going through and expanding that operating envelope for the aircraft, leading our way into follow-on system testing, for sure, learning as we go there,' the RCO head added. The Air Force ultimately expects to take delivery of six pre-production B-21s. The full Raider force is eventually expected to consist of at least 100 aircraft. An aerial view of the first pre-production B-21 during flight test. USAF 'We're actually able to generate two test flights, sometimes, week-in-week &#8230; that's great,' Northrop Grumman's Jones elaborated. 'When we started this journey, way back at contract award, we made a vow that we were going to design this system to be a daily flyer.' 'Clearly, I think we're well on our way to delivering that kind of asset,' he added. Jones said that the B-21 program continues to meet its affordability and schedule targets, but did not elaborate. He added that testing to date has proven the company's digital modeling of the B-21 and its capabilities to be highly accurate. 'Everything we've heard is it flies very much like the model. In fact, a funny story I like to tell about the first flight. We're all very excited to hear from the test pilot&#8230; he said 'it's almost exactly like the model, but we noticed on takeoff, it rotated slightly differently,' Jones recalled. 'So engineers being engineers, they didn't want their model to be wrong. So they pulled off all of the recorded data and looked at it and went back to the test pilot&#8230; [to] say, 'actually, you kind of double-pumped the stick, and when we put that into the simulation it performed exactly the way the simulation said it would, so the model itself is very good.'' 'Overall, I am pleased to see the performance of our test jet. The handling qualities are better than expected coming out of the simulated environment – validating the accuracy of the digital models the team has developed and analyzed over many years,' Chris 'Hoss' Moss, a Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider test pilot, said separately in a statement in a press release the company put out today. Photo courtesy of David Henry, Northrop Grumman Northrop Grumman and the Air Force have both cited the importance of highly accurate models and digital engineering techniques in the development of the B-21 since the initial contract was awarded back in 2015. This has continued in spite of growing criticism that digital engineering's benefits have at least been over-hyped, in general, a viewpoint that the current Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall has himself espoused. When it comes to the B-21, Jones also said that digital engineering had helped reduce risks associated with concurrency, which refers to a system entering production despite the design not being completely finalized in many respects. The pre-production B-21 configuration is understood to be very close to that of the first production examples in large part thanks to modeling done earlier in development. 'If you are around acquisitions a lot, and you heard someone say, 'we're in tests and also in production,' a lot of people would start worrying about something we concurrency, right,' Jones explained. 'And that's something that, traditionally, there's been a lot of risk in, but I believe the digital engineering environment&#8230; and the&#8230; contract management's allocation of risk mitigation actions we've done in concert with RCO has really been able to manage down risk.' Jones added that Northrop Grumman views the modeling for the B-21 to be accurate enough to directly inform test points and overall test planning and that it is now also factoring into the initial low-rate production of the bombers. USAF 'This is the way we're going to build things. We're retroactively putting it into other systems that we build. And I can't imagine going forward in any future designs or builds not adopting this type of &#8230; highly integrated digital model to shop floor methodology,' the Northrop Grumman executive said. The philosophy Jones described has also already been observed in the creation of the Model 437 Vanguard technology demonstrator jet by Northrop Grumman subsidiary Scaled Composites. Colin Miller, Vice President for Engineering within Northrop Grumman’s aeronautics sector, highlighted the influence digital engineering techniques from the B-21 program had on the Model 437 project in an exclusive interview with The War Zone on the latter aircraft that you can find here. Beyond digital engineering, 'in terms of advanced manufacturing, there's a lot of different techniques we're using. We're using robotics in a number of different places, from&#8230; automated fiber layup, in some cases, to automated robotic non-destructive inspection. So we're finding ways to build efficiency in there,' according to Jones. 'One of the areas that has produced some of the most gains is augmented reality. Started out basically just wanting to use augmented reality to get the shop floor instructions [to] where basically the technicians can see them as they're doing the operation and not have to run back and forth to the desk to consult drawings&#8230; And we realized, hey, we can superimpose subsystems and wiring and hydraulic tubing on there and speed up subassemblies.' In addition to the ongoing development and production of the B-21s themselves, the U.S. Air Force is also improving infrastructure, training personnel, and working on tactics, techniques, and procedures to help get ready to actually field the first operational Raiders. Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota is set to host the first operational squadron of the bombers, followed by units at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri and Dyess Air Force Base in Texas. 'You can get on Ellsworth Air Force Base, just drive around and look, it is a substantial lift is what is happening. It's impressive and it is similar to the aircraft itself,' Maj. Gen. Armagost said. 'It's falling on that wing [28th Bomb Wing]. It's falling on the airman. It is falling on the contractors who join with us and partner with us to really make that happen. It's quite impressive.' USAF The first B-21 in a hangar at Plant 42. USAF 'What we have done is modeled what we were calling the 'farm team' as led through the mighty Eighth Air Force, but also directly led through the 31st Test and Evaluation Squadron at Edwards,' Armagost continued. 'And we are gathering from around the Air Force instructors who are experts in their systems and we're bringing them together along the model of operators with industry and acquirers to develop TTPs [tactics, techniques, and procedures] to understand differently how we're going to use this penetrating system, this sixth generation penetrating system, in a way that we have to work our way through so that when we have it on the ramp at Ellsworth Air Force Base, we're ready to do that.' 'We're trying to be very ahead of how we might actually deploy this airplane. And I would say that's what's different about the B-21 from the B-2,' Armagost continued. 'I think we learned some lessons early on in the B-2 program that maybe we could have done it slightly differently along these lines.' By all indications, the Air Force, together with Northrop Grumman, is making progress in not just getting its hands on its first production B-21s, but having them in operational service in the 2030s.

More Electronics Explode In Lebanon As Israel Declares ‘New Phase...	Following yesterday’s unprecedented explosions targeting pagers belonging to thousands of Hezbollah members, which you can read about here, another wave of similar blasts has struck Lebanon. The second series of explosions seems to have targeted walkie-talkies used by members of the Iran-backed militant group, although there are suggestions that a variety of different electronic devices may have been affected. While Israel has not claimed responsibility for either of the two days’ attacks, Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant today declared the start of a 'new phase' of the war with a focus on the northern front.

Three of those killed were said to have been in the Bekaa region in the east of the country. Many of the injuries were reported to victims’ abdomens and hands, as was the case yesterday.

A Hezbollah source confirmed the nature of the attack, which so far bears many of the hallmarks of yesterday’s series of explosions, which was widely attributed to Israel. As was the case yesterday, when pagers were targeted, injuring more than 2,800 and killing 12, the explosions today were reportedly 'small in size.'

Today, several solar power systems reportedly also exploded in people’s homes across Lebanon, according to the National News Agency, with at least one such blast injuring a girl in the town of al-Zahrani, south Lebanon.

Additional reports state that at least one of the models of walkie-talkie that exploded in Lebanon today was discontinued, but that Hezbollah got a shipment of them five months ago, around the same time that it appears to have received the pagers involved in yesterday’s blasts. This would clearly point to the devices being tampered with before they arrived in Hezbollah’s hands. However it was achieved, today’s events do at least suggest that many more types of electronic devices could have been modified into explosive devices, raising more questions about how the attacks were orchestrated, and whether more will come. The deeper implications of this dystopian development are something we have previously discussed at length. UPDATE - The radios that were booby-trapped in advance by Israeli intelligence services and then delivered to Hezbollah were part of the group's emergency communications system which was supposed to be used during a war with Israel, sources tell Axios  Faytuks News (@Faytuks) September 18, 2024 However, if Israel is now able to target Hezbollah members and associates via a variety of types of electronic devices, the last two days of attacks may also imply that Israel is poised to launch a large-scale campaign against the militant group. Not only do these explosions help remove key Hezbollah figures from the equation, but they also greatly reduce the group’s ability to communicate and maintain a chain of command. Then there is the significant factor of sowing fear and confusion within Hezbollah but also more broadly within Lebanon, comprising the group’s ability to operate more freely. Overloading the hospitals with injuries would be another impact of these detonations that would benefit an opposing force prior to a campaign. In a reflection of the chaos created by the blasts, there were reports today of Hezbollah members frantically pulling the batteries out of any walkie-talkies that had not exploded, and putting the parts in metal barrels, in case they detonated. Two sources tell Axios that Israel's goal in the second wave of attacks today was to increase paranoia and fear in Hezbollah's ranks pic.twitter.com/CJulO0jn7Q&mdash; Faytuks News (@Faytuks) September 18, 2024 As TWZ editor-in-chief Tyler Rogoway has observed, if Israel invested heavily into such an exotic espionage capability, it may be compelled to use it to its maximum extent as rapidly as possible if there was imminent risk of it being compromised. Under ideal circumstances, such measures would be exploited prior to or just at the beginning of a major military operation in order to degrade the opposing for as discussed above. Now there are signs that Israel is about to launch just such an operation. There are also reports that the detonation of these devices was rushed out of fears that the operation would be uncovered. Clearly, if you have the ability to detonate pagers and other electronic devices belonging to players in your adversary's ranks, you do it right before or at the start of a major military operation to:1.) Take many players, including key ones, off the board 2.) Cripple comms…&mdash; Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) September 18, 2024 International concern is building, too. Even before today’s explosions, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said it was 'very important' that civilian objects should not be weaponized. The U.N. chief said that yesterday’s explosions presented 'a serious risk of a dramatic escalation in Lebanon' and warned that 'everything must be done' to avoid that. He continued: 'What has happened is particularly serious, not only because of the number of victims that it caused, but because of the indications that exist that this was triggered, I would say, in advance of a normal way to trigger these things, because there was a risk of this being discovered.' I’m deeply alarmed by reports that a large number of communication devices exploded across Lebanon & Syria, killing at least 11 people, including children, and injuring thousands.All actors must exercise maximum restraint to avert any further escalation.&mdash; António Guterres (@antonioguterres) September 18, 2024 The European Union’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, described the device detonations in Lebanon as 'extremely worrying,' noting that they had caused 'heavy, indiscriminate collateral damage among civilians.' There are now other signs from Israel that it may well be poised to begin a more concerted campaign against Hezbollah, including unconfirmed reports of movements of large numbers of troops and armor toward the border.

Gen. Herzi Halevi, the head of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), said the country has drawn up plans for additional action against Hezbollah and is ready to strike. Halevi also warned that Israel has 'many more capabilities' that have not been used yet. 'We have many capabilities that we have not yet activated… we have seen some of these things, it seems to me that we are well prepared, and we are preparing these plans going forward. At each stage, the price for Hezbollah needs to be high,' Halevi added.

Taken together, and potentially driven by the need to rush the electronics detonations, these developments may well indicate that a large-scale conflict between Israel and Hezbollah could be imminent, fueled by tensions that have increased dramatically in recent months.

New Look At B-21 Raider Stealth Bomber Flight Testing Released	The U.S. Air Force has released new video footage of its first pre-production B-21 Raider stealth bomber undergoing flight testing. The service just recently confirmed plans to field Raider squadrons at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri and Dyess Air Force Base in Texas, in addition to Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota that is set to be the home of the first operational B-21s. The Air Force released the video above around the Air & Space Forces Association's main annual conference, which wraps up today just outside Washington, D.C. Today also happens to be the Air Force's 77th birthday. The footage again various distinctive features of the B-21, including its unusual cockpit window arrangement, which you can read more about here. Also prominently visible are the Raider's two swing-up auxiliary intake doors. These help suck in more air for the engines during take-offs and landings where high power settings, steeper angles of attack, and slower speeds can be too much for the bomber's deeply-buried main inlets to handle alone. A previously released picture of the first pre-production B-21 highlighting its cockpit window arrangement and auxiliary intake doors. Photo courtesy of David Henry, Northrop Grumman Northrop Grumman's B-21 is the most advanced aircraft ever built, at least that we know about, and is the most significant development for the U.S. Air Force in recent memory, as The War Zone has explored in detail in the past. The first pre-production Raider, which took to the skies for the first time from Plant 42 in Palmdale, California last November and is now at Edwards Air Force Base in the same state, is also said to be very representative of the final production configuration. Five more pre-production examples are in various stages of being built. The Air Force currently plans to buy at least 100 B-21s, but there have already been discussions about a larger total fleet size. As already noted, the first operational Raiders are set to head to Ellsworth and the hope is that the bombers will be flying real missions before the end of the decade. The Air Force will then move to establish B-21 squadrons at Whiteman and Dyess. 'We continue to achieve B-21 production milestones; through digital engineering and open architecture design, we are getting an agile strategic deterrent that delivers a decisive response as required,' Air Force Gen. Thomas Bussiere, head of Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), said in a statement last week. This accompanied the formal announcement that B-21s will be headed to Whiteman and Dyess. USAF Before then, the expanding force of pre-production B-21s based at Edwards will be put through extensive testing. 'We are in the flight test program, the flight test program is proceeding well,' Andrew Hunter, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology & Logistics, told members of Congress in May. 'It is doing what flight test programs are designed to do, which is helping us learn about the unique characteristics of this platform, but in a very, very effective way.' The new video underscores this important testing work as the Air Force moves toward fielding its first B-21s in the coming years.

Work Toward KC-135 Tankers That Fly Themselves, Uncrewed Cargo Ai...	The U.S. Air Force is pushing ahead with experimentation that could lead to the transformation of KC-135 tankers into optionally crewed aircraft, as well as the development of other autonomous aerial refueling capabilities. U.S. military interest in autonomous airlifters, an area where China has been notably surging forward in the past few years, is also growing. Air Force Gen. Jacqueline Van Ovost, head of U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM), discussed work on autonomous aerial refueling and airlift capabilities with The War Zone and other members of the media at a roundtable on the sidelines of the main annual Air & Space Forces Association conference yesterday. TRANSCOM serves as a centralized U.S. military-wide manager for logistical support in the air, as well as on the ground and at sea. 'So we're actually in a &#8230; Cooperative Research and Development Agreement [CRADA] on autonomous KC-135,' Van Ovost said. 'So we are looking at that.' US Air Force KC-135 tankers. USAF CRADAs provide the U.S. military with a mechanism to partner with industry, academia, and other organizations on projects outside of normal contracting processes and they typically involve an exchange of resources and data in lieu of traditional payment. Autonomous flight technology company Merlin has been leading the work relating to the KC-135 in cooperation with the Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC), a major aerospace firm that specializes in aircraft modification, and the U.S. Air Force's Air Mobility Command (AMC) and Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC). AMC oversees the vast majority of the service's tankers and airlifters. Merlin's efforts with regard to the KC-135 have been focused first on ways autonomous capabilities can help reduce the workload for aircrews. 'Starting [on] July 22, Merlin and SNC were granted a temporary military flight release by the United States Air Force (USAF). The team conducted real-time data collection and analysis to inform the Merlin Pilot’s integration design and flight control tuning for military aircraft,' according to a press release from Merlin in August. 'The flights support an ongoing agreement with Air Mobility Command (AMC) and Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) to design, integrate, test, and demonstrate aspects of the Merlin Pilot on the KC-135. Merlin engineers also joined USAF pilots on data collection flights at MacDill Air Force Base in May 2024.' 'The flights helped the team better understand crew workload drivers for military use cases,' Merlin's August release added. 'Together, these milestones signify Merlin’s progressive system design and integration work to achieve its goal of an in-flight demonstration of the Merlin Pilot in the next year.' Autonomous capabilities that can be integrated into existing Air Force KC-135s and other tankers could also support other ongoing initiatives. In speaking yesterday, Gen. Van Ovost highlighted AMC's experimentation with aerial refuelers, as well as airlifters, flown by skeleton crews. The Air Force has presented this as a potential way to help increase sortie rates and overall operational capacity, especially in a potential future high-end conflict, such as one in the Pacific against China. Flight safety and other questions have been raised about these plans, as you can read about in more detail here. What Merlin, SNC, and the Air Force are working on now could help provide extra margins of safety to AMC aircrews in general. Greater autonomy or even pilot-optional capabilities could just help breathe new life into the Air Force's aging KC-135s, as well as feed into future aerial refueling developments. The service is currently in the process of refining core requirements for its Next Generation Air-refueling System (NGAS), which is expected to be a multi-layered 'system of systems.' A rendering of a notional next-generation stealth tanker, something that could be part of the future NGAS family of systems. Lockheed Martin Skunk Works via Aviation Week 'There's the Analysis of Alternatives for the NGAS &#8230; that's coming out here at the end of this year. It's been&#8230; almost two years of work &#8230; and the initial insights are not surprising,' Gen. Van Ovost said at yesterday's roundtable. 'How do you fly into a contested environment? How do you shrink the visibility of your airplane, right? How much does it have to carry?' Van Ovost also highlighted questions about how NGAS platforms might refuel crewed and uncrewed aircraft, and do so in instances where the tanker and/or the receiver are operating autonomously to some degree. Crewed stealth tankers, as well as uncrewed aerial refuelers and new podded 'buddy store' refueling systems with collapsible or retractable booms, have already been discussed as potential components of NGAS. The initiative is now directly tied to other major modernization efforts, including the fate of plans for a new crewed sixth-generation stealth combat jet, as you can learn more about here. 'Frankly, I think in air fueling, that's the place I would go to first [to integrate more autonomy], because we're already seeing some capabilities for autonomous boom engagements,' the head of TRANSCOM added. Both Boeing in the United States and Airbus in Europe have been actively working on and demonstrating capabilities to increasingly automate the process of boom-equipped tankers linking up receivers, including uncrewed ones. The boom method remains the Air Force's preferred way of getting gas into aircraft in flight, though it does have probe-and-drogue tankers primarily for refueling helicopters and V-22 Ospreys. The probe-and-drogue method is also predominant in the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps, as well as many other countries around the world. In addition to autonomous aerial refueling capabilities, Van Ovost talked about interest in autonomous airlifters, which the Air Force has also been experimenting with in recent years, at yesterday's roundtable. She did highlight additional complexities that come along with uncrewed aerial logistics platforms, especially when it comes to moving personnel, that aren't necessarily considerations when talking about pilotless tankers. 'If I have an autonomous capability that's doing that last tactical mile, and it goes to an airfield or a road, how does it autonomously offload, turn around, and fly back?' she asked rhetorically. 'So we are looking at what technologies that [it] would&#8230; take to do that, what will be the concept of operations. &#8230; could you launch it out of C-17? Would it then recover at a known airfield somewhere, in Australia or whatever? So we're looking at all of that and that certainly is on the table.' Van Ovost's mention of Australia underscores significant discussions ongoing now about what kind of new and novel logistics chains will be required to sustain future operations in a high-end Pacific fight where U.S. forces will be dispersed across broad areas many of which will be separated by large expanses of water. Distributed hub-and-spoke air mobility concepts incorporating cargo and potentially personnel-carrying drones, which would also be more employable in higher-risk environments, could be key elements of that equation in the future. China is looking at the same realities for future operations and, while the U.S. Air Force has been experimenting with uncrewed airlifters, there has been a much more substantial explosion in developments in this realm from Chinese aviation firms recently. Just this year, Chinese drone maker Tengden and the country's state-run Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) announced the first flights of two new uncrewed cargo-carrying aircraft. Tengden's new design has a stated payload capacity of around 4,410 pounds (2,000 kilograms), larger than anything similar the U.S. Air Force has tested to date, at least publicly. Gen. Van Ovost has made clear that the U.S. Air Force and TRANSCOM remain very interested in autonomous aerial refueling, airlift, and other logistics capabilities. At the same time, U.S. developments in this regard still look to be in their infancy, despite how essential they could be in future conflicts.

Dmitry Bulgakov, the then deputy minister of defense, the facility met 'the highest international standards.' 'The arsenal in Toropets allows us to shelter reserves of missiles and ammunition from external influences and ensure their safety and fire and explosion safety,' Bulgakov said at the time. The site covers an area of around two square miles, with an outside perimeter of roughly seven miles.

While this hasn’t been independently verified, North Korean short-range ballistic missiles have been used by Russia since at least December 30, 2023. Although they make up only a very small fraction of the weapons used in Russian strikes on Ukraine, there has long been concern about the burgeoning military relationship between Moscow and Pyongyang. Kyrylo Budanov, Ukraine’s military intelligence chief, recently placed North Korea at the top of the list of countries that provided the most military support to Russia, saying that 'North Korea would be first, then there is no one for a long time, and then everyone else.' A fragment of wreckage from a North Korean missile is presented after a Russian attack on Kharkiv, on March 14, 2024. Photo by Denys Glushko /Gwara Media/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images Global Images Ukraine According to Russian reports, Toropets has been previously attacked, in May and June of this year. With Kyiv’s Western partners still refusing to allow the use of long-range weapons they have supplied to hit targets deep inside Russia, Ukraine has continued to make use of domestically produced one-way attack drones instead. The developing capabilities of its one-way attack drones have allowed Ukraine to strike targets at distances of more than 1,000 miles in the past. While long-range Ukrainian attacks against targets within Russian borders have had an important morale-boosting role, the campaign of drone strikes has increasingly concentrated on key energy infrastructure and military targets. With that in mind, the apparent level of destruction in Toropets should also have a positive impact for Ukraine both on the battlefield and as it seeks to defend itself against Russian long-range strikes.

Skunk Works’ Losing Loyal Wingman Drone Was Very Stealthy 'Gold P...	Lockheed Martin's losing entry in the first increment of the U.S. Air Force's Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drone program was a very stealthy design, the head of the famed Skunk Works advanced projects division has disclosed. The company is now expecting future CCA increments to revolve around proposals that might lean closer to not just being lower-cost, but maybe even expendable, to support a concept of operations that requires tolerance for very high losses. All of this speaks to broader questions about how the Air Force is balancing capabilities and cost with regard to CCAs, which the service sees as critical to winning future conflicts, especially high-end fights against near-peer competitors like China. John Clark, Lockheed Martin Vice President and General Manager of Advanced Development Programs (ADP), better known as Skunk Works, spoke to The War Zone and others about CCAs and other developments at the Air & Space Forces Association's main annual conference today. In April, the Air Force announced that it had picked General Atomics and Anduril to proceed in the CCA program's Increment One. The service is still in the process of refining its requirements for a second of what is expected to be multiple subsequent increments. The expectation currently is that CCAs of any kind will work very closely together with crewed combat aircraft and under the direct supervision of human operators. A model of Anduril's Fury drone, which it is now developing under the CCA Program's Increment One. Jamie Hunter 'Our Increment One offering had higher levels of stealth than were necessary in the requirements because of the operational analysis conviction of building something that actually had value to the Air Force over the long haul,' Clark said. 'I think, hindsight 20/20, we could certainly armchair quarterback and say, well the Air Force isn't valuing survivability right now, so we gold-plated something they didn't need gold-plated.' Clark did not mention it explicitly, but in 2022, Skunk Works had publicly laid out a future crewed-uncrewed teaming vision that included multiple tiers of drones, including a very low-observable (stealthy) type, as you can read more about here. The designs that General Atomics and Anduril are working on right now both have stealthy characteristics, but neither one has a very high level of broadband low-observability (stealthiness) like one might find on something like Northrop Grumman's B-21 Raider stealth bomber. The War Zone just explored these trade-offs in a story about how the U.S. military is continuing to pass over more exquisite, very stealthy, and highly autonomous uncrewed combat air vehicles (UCAV) in favor of pursuing lower-tier CCAs. This is despite China and others actively pursuing stealthy flying wing UCAVs. 'You can go look at what's represented in GA's [General Atomics] booth or the AFRL [Air Force Research Laboratory] booth. What you see is that they try to take all the [radar signal] energy &#8230; [and] as it comes nose on it splashes around,' Clark added. 'But if you look there's these tails on the side that are big reflectors that all that energy hits the side of the tail and comes right back.' General Atomics and Anduril brought models of their respective CCAs to display at the AFA convention. General Atomics' XQ-67 Off-Board Sensing Station (OBSS) drone, which it developed for AFRL and from which its CCA design is partially derived, is also on the show floor. A model of General Atomics' CCA design. Jamie Hunter 'The way it reaches its survivability is modest stealth with a lot of interoperability with other Department of Defense systems,' Michael Atwood, VP of Advanced Programs for General Atomics, told The War Zone about his company's CCA in a separate interview from the show floor that you can find here. Skunk Works' Clark did acknowledge other ways to achieve survivability beyond stealthy design features. However, he argued that things like electronic warfare jammers and other countermeasures are complementary rather than substitutes for higher degrees of stealth. 'Do you want to put your asset at risk? Do you want to put your crew at risk on the premise of the countermeasure alone? Or do you want to have a very solid foundation that allows you to get closer and interoperate, or have that freedom of maneuver, and then if something happens to go bad, I can employ the countermeasure as an evasive tactic?,' Clark asked rhetorically. 'I'm going to drive in on the adversary. And what happens if that [AN/]ALQ-99 just happens to stop working right when I go into the adversary area? The jammer is no longer working and I've now put myself in dire straits. There's no escaping that.' 'So that's philosophically the way that we look at it is it putting countermeasures together on top of stealth [is] very good,' he continued. 'Not having that basic foundation that we begin with puts yourself in a very risky situation that if it works, great. [But] none of that stuff works 100 percent of the time.' A rendering showing an F-35 flying together with various types of drones, including a very stealthy flying wing design at top center, that Skunk Works has released in the past. Lockheed Martin Skunk Works All of this is impacting how Lockheed Martin plans to approach the second increment of the CCA program and its beliefs about what the Air Force is likely to be looking for in that next phase. 'So with Increment Two, I think that right now we're actively looking at how the Air Force is going to go with their requirements. I think that what we see from a macro level&#8230; environment, is that something &#8230; that has more expendable characteristics and is at a much, much lower cost point,' Clark said. That 'seems to be a good place to go explore. And so that's where we're exploring and putting time and energy in is in that trade space, because ultimately, from a buying power perspective, you've got to find something that's actually executing the mission, but not costing the national treasury on the first day of the war when you lose most of your aircraft.' Clark stressed that this was Lockheed Martin's view based on the information it has in hand and not on the actual Increment Two CCA requirements, which the Air Force says it has not finalized. It is interesting to note here that the U.S. Navy has presented a vision for its CCA program, which is separate, but heavily intertwined with the Air Force effort, wherein drones might be 'expended' as munitions or targets when they reach the end of what could be very short service lives. At least for Increment One CCAs, the Air Force has been targeting a unit cost of roughly a quarter to a third of the price of an F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. F-35 prices differ based on variant and fluctuate regularly, but publicly available data puts the CCA price range between around $20.5 and $27.5 million. As The War Zone has reported in the past, what is known about the Increment One requirements has pointed to higher performance designs with price points at the very high end of the project cost range. The Air Force is aiming for Increment One CCAs, at least, to cost between one-quarter and one-third of the price of F-35 stealth fighters like the A models seen here. USAF 'I think that there will &#8230; be a reckoning to come at some point when [the Air Force is] looking at [a scenario where] &#8230; I'm going to spend $15 million or $20 million an airplane, and the OA [operational analysis] is telling me that 80 percent or more of them don't make it home,' Clark said. 'How many airplanes am I willing to spend that sort of money on before that's a losing proposition financially as a nation.' 'That's a question that I'm very interested in how the Air Force will ultimately choose to go down that path,' he continued. 'What is the right place from an expendable asset [perspective] and what's the right place from an attritable [one], and where do you want to have something that comes home every time? And I think that's part of what the Air Force is looking to go experiment with and learn more about &#8230; but that's something that, given our OA, we already have some strong convictions about what we think is necessary.' These are certainly questions the Air Force will need to answer and the service has already made clear that what it will want from CCA Increment Two could be dramatically different from the Increment One requirements. 'So what should Increment 2 be? Do not assume and it may not be just an evolution of Increment 1. It could be an entirely different set of missions. Could be [an] entirely different kind of an aircraft,' Andrew Hunter, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology & Logistics, said at the 2024 Defense News Conference earlier this month. 'And so part of that initial work is, again, starting with a large vendor pool, what are the good ideas out there? We’ll have some ideas [about] what we think Increment 2 needs to do as part of a broader force, and that’s part of this broader look at air dominance and how we’re going to deliver that.' The Air Force is also expecting to face broader budgetary pressures in the coming years, a reality that has already helped prompt a top-to-bottom review of plans to acquire a new crewed sixth-generation stealth combat jet. That aircraft and the CCA drones are part of the service's larger Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) modernization effort. The future of the NGAD combat jet, as well as the CCA Increment Two requirements, are also now further tied to other ongoing deliberations about stealth tankers and other future aerial refueling capabilities, as you can read more about here.

Collins Aerospace A rendering of a notional sixth-generation crewed combat jet flying together with a trio of drones. Collins Aerospace Regardless, it is now clear that Skunk Works passionately believed a more advanced and survivable design was the outright critical route for the Air Force's CCA needs, a gamble that ended up in a loss on Increment One, but things could change if the service learns that its cheaper and simpler designs outright lack combat effectiveness and general survivability.

Link 16 Coverage From Space, Laser Communications Relays Make Maj...	The U.S. Space Development Agency, or SDA has outlined the progress made so far in demonstrating a satellite-based Link 16 system to transmit data directly from space, the potential of laser communications to connect satellites together in a mesh network and back to earth, as well as developments in using those same satellites to conduct missile tracking from low Earth orbit (LEO). All could have significant implications for future conflicts. The updates were provided by SDA director Derek M. Tournear, speaking at the Air & Space Forces Association’s (AFA) main annual conference just outside Washington, D.C. yesterday. Derek M Tournear, Space Development Agency director. U.S. Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Raisa Christie U.S. Air Force Airman 1st Class Raisa Christie To explore the potential of Link 16 in space, SDA is using satellites from York Space Systems, with the first data sent via this system in November of last year. The initial space-to-ground Link 16 connection was from LEO and involved three of York’s T0 Transport Layer satellites and what the SDA described as 'a series of receivers using terrestrial radios during three demonstrations held November 21-27, 2023.' 'Operators working with SDA conducted both passive and active network entry, obtained fine synchronization, and transmitted multiple tactical messages from satellites using L-band radios aboard Tranche 0 (T0) Transport Layer satellites to a ground test site located within the territory of a Five Eyes partner nation,' the agency announced in a media release at the time. The Five Eyes partners are Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States, which share a broad range of intelligence with one another. Another set of data-transport satellites, built by Lockheed Martin and launched in September 2023, are also now serving the Link 16 trials. In all, the SDA’s initial Tranche 0 constellation comprises 28 satellites — 19 transport and eight tracking satellites in LEO, plus one ground-based testbed satellite. Link 16 is a NATO-standard tactical datalink communication system and one that’s central to U.S. and allied military operations, allowing coalition forces to seamlessly transmit and exchange real-time situational awareness data. A U.S. Marine Corps radio operator uses the AN/PRC-117 Multiband Manpack Radio to set up communication during exercise Steel Knight at Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms, California, Dec. 5, 2019. U.S. Marine Corps photo by Cpl. Alexa M. Hernandez Cpl. Alexa Hernandez Link 16 is also a fundamental component of America’s expanding Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) initiative, which aims to allow commanders to share data and create a 'common operating picture' for real-time intelligence and automate fire control. Using satellites to support Link 16 connectivity offers various benefits, including the potential to provide a more robust link between sensors and shooters wherever they may be. While traditional Link 16 radios have a line-of-sight range of around 200 to 300 nautical miles, putting relay systems in space has the huge advantage of providing beyond-line-of-sight communications around the globe in near-real-time. Already, providing an active Link 16 network across a region via an aircraft gateway brings significant advantages and a space-based capability should provide this same capability on a much wider and more persistent level. So far, Tournear says, the results of putting Link 16 in space have been impressive. 'Essentially, 100 percent of our links work every time we go in,' Tournear said in his briefing yesterday. 'When someone's prepared to listen to us, we transmit, receive, and that works. We’ve demonstrated that to a lot of different platforms, including aircraft with the Navy and down to aircraft carriers at sea. All that works perfectly.' In the Tranche 0 configuration, satellites can maintain Link 16 contact for around 10 minutes at a time, which Tournear said is 'working exceptionally well.' However, for Tranche 1, it will be possible to maintain contact longer with each satellite. More importantly, Tranche 1 will eventually involve more than 100 satellites. 'Essentially, any time you’re on the globe, you’ll be able to look up and have at least one, if not two to four, Link 16 satellites overhead at any given time. So you’ll have that assured connectivity with that network,' Tournear said. Meanwhile, for the laser communication experiments, the SDA is using a pair of missile-tracking satellites built by SpaceX and launched in April 2023. The video below from the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) offers a good overview of the benefits of laser-based communications systems. The idea behind the laser communications tests is to have satellites that can ‘talk to’ one another as well as to communicate with ground stations, ships and aircraft via laser, ensuring data can be moved around the globe quickly and more securely than past communications methods. The advantages of using lasers for this include the ability to rapidly transmit higher volumes of data as well as making it much harder for a potential adversary to intercept or jam those communications. Initially, SDA demonstrated that it was possible to maintain laser communications links 'for a couple of hours at a time,' but now the satellites are 'able to maintain link essentially longer than 24 hours at a time,' Tournear said. 'They drop link maybe once every other day, and it takes them, you know, under 100 seconds to regain that link again. That’s essentially where we need it to be for an operational system.' As well as communications between satellites, Tournear said that the Tranche 1 version of the laser system would extend communications to assets on the ground and to airborne systems. Tournear also said that one of the next steps will be to demonstrate the transfer of data between the York satellites using the mesh network, the concept used in SpaceX’s Starlink commercial satellite constellation. After that, he said he wanted to show that crosslinks could also be set up between the York and SpaceX satellites. As regards using satellites to create a missile tracking layer, Tournear confirmed that the SDA has demonstrated the detection of 'a lot of targeted opportunities, including some small, short-range ballistic missile launches — we’ve been able to detect and track them, as well as larger launches and even the Starship reentry, things like that. That’s all going exceptionally well.' Bearing in mind the extensive use of ballistic missiles in Ukraine and, more recently in the latest Gaza war, the option to call upon satellites for missile tracking is an especially interesting one, as Tournear observed: 'If you just look at a lot of the missiles that are being utilized in the Russia–Ukraine conflict, those are starting to get into what we have always euphemistically referred to as ‘advanced missile threats.’ Especially when you start to get to a lot of those, and I’ll talk about the April 13 event when Iran attacked Israel, when you start to get many, many volleys and missiles that are short-range ballistic in nature, that’s where you really see the advantage of this proliferated low Earth orbit tracking constellation.' In the future, the combination of missile-tracking SDA satellites and new communications networks will mean that data on missile activities will be distributed to theater commanders much quicker than has traditionally been the case. An Iskander short-range ballistic missile, a type that has been heavily utilized by Russia in its war in Ukraine. Russian Ministry of Defense Russian Ministry of Defense The next phase of all this work will involve yet more satellites, under Tranche 1 of the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA), which will seek to make operational the communications capabilities tested so far. Contracts for Tranche 1 were awarded in February 2022 and called for satellites to be ready to launch by September 2024. This schedule has now shifted, with Tournear now stating that the satellites will be launched in 2025. Tranche 1 will be a significant effort, involving six launches that will put 128 data transport satellites into orbit, four to send up 35 missile warning/tracking satellites, and one launch to deliver 12 demonstration and experimentation satellites. Previously, plans called for a launch rate of around one launch every two months, leading to an initial operational capability for PWSA by the summer of 2025, but this schedule may well now have slipped. While PWSA promises to bring powerful new communications capabilities for U.S. and allied warfighters, this kind of technology doesn’t come cheap and is arriving at a time in which U.S. defense budgets are under strain. In the past, Tournear has said that he’s confident that it will be possible to drive down the costs of a single data transport satellite to around $15 million. It’s hoped that the potential benefits offered by the commercial sector will mitigate the challenges of inflation and traditional supply chains, but that remains to be seen. After all, Tournear has also admitted that, while the costs of the satellites themselves should drop as the market grows, adding new capabilities will push the prices back up. The importance of PWSA shouldn’t be underestimated, with the SDA describing it as nothing less than 'the backbone of JADC2 in space.' Once up and running, the delivery of tactical messages, including beyond-line-of-sight scenarios, will be achieved not only by platforms within the atmosphere but also by a network of Link 16 systems aboard multiple space vehicles. As well as the addition to the communications node, SDA is also moving ever closer toward a new constellation of satellites that will also be able to communicate with each other much more reliably than was previously the case, and also bring their sensors to bear on ballistic missile threats, helping to keep tabs on a critical proliferating threat. Overall, the SDA’s emerging architectures focused on constellations of many satellites instead of a handful of larger, more expensive ones should make the entire space-based system far more resilient to enemy attack — and capable — than in the past.

General Atomics Says Its Collaborative Combat Aircraft Is Like A ...	General Atomics, which is one of two finalists for the first increment of the USAF’s high-stakes Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) program gave The War Zone a close look at their design, as well as the closely related XQ-67A Off-Board Sensing Station (OBSS) drone. The company brought the CCA model and the actual XQ-67A OBSS to the show floor at the Air & Space Force Association’s annual Air, Space, Cyber convention just outside of Washington, D.C. General Atomics' CCA design is derived from the XQ-67 and reflects work the company has done and continues to explore on concepts revolving around the use of a core chassis onto which very different airframes — from those optimized for loitering near contested territory for long periods of time to much higher performance, transonic, fighter-like configurations — can be installed. OBSS has already played as something of a partial proof of concept for the common chassis idea. General Atomics is also developing a full family of drones, called Gambit, around this concept, each with the same chassis that includes landing gear and critical mission and flight control computer systems. You can read more about the company's CCA design, the XQ-67, and Gambit here. Michael Atwood, VP of advanced programs for General Atomics, gave us a great overview of both aircraft designs, and mentioned some interesting things, including how apparently their CCA is designed to be able to operate from rough fields. He also described exactly how General Atomics is positioning its increment one CCA contender in terms of balancing cost and capability, stating: 'General Atomics believes in balanced survivability. Which is while this plane may have some stealth features, we rely on a variety of methods, from the seafloor to space, to augment the capability. So really what you can see this as is kind of a weapons truck. It can bring all sorts of different types of weapons in different configurations, but the way it reaches its survivability is modest stealth with a lot of interoperability with other Department of Defense systems… Attritability has been a hard number for us to figure out. XQ-67 allowed us to find relative cost points where we could bring this aircraft to bear. You can think of some of these airplanes being match sticks, you can think of some of them being Zippo lighters that you refill and use all the time. We tried to make this be the Bic lighter — the thing that you’re going to depend on, that you are going to take on your camping trip that’s going to work. but after you have used its useful life, you throw away and don’t have this huge O and S (operating and support) cost.'

Hezbollah’s Exploding Pagers Could Be As Monumental A Cyber-Espio...	In an extraordinary development in the Middle East conflict, thousands of Hezbollah members have been injured and at least three people were killed after pagers that the militants used exploded simultaneously today. While exactly how this occurred remains unclear, it could very well be a monumental cyber attack that could have widespread implications far beyond the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. Regardless, it should be a wake-up call. While no one has so far taken responsibility, Hezbollah has blamed Israel for the attack. A source from the group said that they expect the attack may have been launched in response to an alleged assassination attempt by the Lebanese militant group on a former senior Israeli security official. The existence of that plot was only revealed today by Israel’s Shin Bet security agency.

At the time of writing, at least nine people have died and approximately 2,800 have been wounded, according to Lebanon’s Minister of Health Firas Abiad.

Photo by Anwar AMRO / AFP ANWAR AMRO The incidents have led to alarm among Hezbollah, with one official from the group telling Reuters that the pager explosions represented the 'biggest security breach' they had faced since the start of the current Gaza war. Security considerations mean that Hezbollah is responsible for its own discrete communication network and there have been previous concerns that Israel may have managed to penetrate its telecommunications. This speculation, though unconfirmed, has been fueled since October by the assassination of several Hezbollah commanders, with targeting coordinates having been generated for locations that were otherwise considered safe. Lebanon, and specifically Beirut, has been in Israel’s sights since Hezbollah began a campaign of rocket and drone strikes against Israel almost a year ago, in solidarity with Hamas, after that group launched its surprise invasion on October 7, 2023, starting the current conflict in Gaza. Smoke billows after rockets were fired from southern Lebanon over the Upper Galilee region in northern Israel on September 11, 2024. Photo by Jalaa MAREY / AFP JALAA MAREY Tensions between Israel and Hezbollah have increased dramatically in recent months, stoking fears of a large-scale conflict breaking out between them. One key factor in the standoff is Israel’s stated plan to return tens of thousands of Israelis who had been evacuated from towns along the northern border with Lebanon when Hezbollah stepped up its campaign of rocket attacks. With the return of these evacuees now approved by Israeli officials, there have been suggestions that a major military operation may be about to be launched against the militant group. As well as the evacuations, the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah has so far resulted in hundreds of deaths, most of them from the Lebanese militant group, as well as Israeli civilians and soldiers. The prospect of a large-scale offensive against Hezbollah isn’t universally supported by Israeli officials. This has led to reports that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could be poised to remove Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant from his post since he is said to oppose such an operation. In the meantime, Lebanon deals with the bloody aftermath of today’s pager explosions. Hezbollah's pagers were jammed by Israel and caused their batteries to explode in different parts of Lebanon.Here's two examples. pic.twitter.com/iCjEyoxR7d&mdash; Clash Report (@clashreport) September 17, 2024 Speculation is already growing as to how Israel might have carried out the campaign. There have been reports, including from three different security sources, that the targeted pagers were from a recent shipment to arrive in Lebanon. If true, that could suggest that they had some kind of malware implanted in them and an explosive charge. This would have required Israel to intercept and alter or swap out the shipments of these pagers, which would be a complex affair, but not one outside of the realm of feasibility. WSJ: exploding pagers were from a new shipment that arrived recently, were carried by hundreds of Hezbollah members; Hezbollah official speculates malware caused the devices to overheat and explode; some members felt pagers getting hot and disposed of them&mdash; Aleph א (@no_itsmyturn) September 17, 2024 Another possibility is that the lithium batteries in the pagers were triggered into an overheating mode, turning them into improvised explosive devices. The potential for commercial lithium batteries to explode is something that we have touched upon in a previous report. In such a way, it may have been possible for Israel to remotely trigger a ‘thermal runaway,’ in which a power source either bursts into flames or explodes. It's also possible that a combination of the two, insertion of malware or alterations physically to the devices and using cyber warfare to exploit that structured vulnerability at an opportune time could also be at play here. 'Exclusive sources for Sky News Arabia: Mossad placed a quantity of highly explosive PETN on the devices’ battery and detonated it by raising the battery’s temperature.' Evergreen Intel (@vcdgf555) September 17, 2024 In a similar manner how the deployment of the Stuxnet malicious software worm — which Israel played a direct role in — against Iran's nuclear program two decades ago was a revelation that highlighted the new realities of cyber warfare, this event could end up having a similar effect. Turning everyday electronics that include wireless connectivity into improvised explosive devices may seem like dystopian science fiction, but it really isn't that far-fetched. Considering everyone reading this likely has just such a device in their pocket or hand, and considering the potential vulnerabilities of hardware created overseas, often by possible future adversaries, as well as the software that controls these devices, the alarm bells couldn't ring any louder, even if this event proves to be something else. We interact every day with examples of networked technology — from the cars we drive to the computer hardware we use to make a living — that also have power packs with large amounts of stored potential energy. So targeting such devices for nefarious kinetic purposes is darkly logical. When you think about it in that light, the explosive/incendiary charges are already distributed all over the globe by the billions. The possible ability to connect to and trigger those charges is, at least in theory, already built in. Now targeting the right devices and making them actually ignite is another thing, but for some devices, that could be more of a software challenge above anything else. Being able to remotely target individuals via their unique device, which has their electronic fingerprint attached to it, is also an unprecedented concept to comprehend. A potential kinetic attack opportunity like this has never existed in human history and even an adversary just lighting as many batteries on fire in a target country could cause massive and widespread damage and a near halt to productivity. This is just one of myriad potential cyber attack vectors that could cripple an entire society. On the other hand, if Israel meddled with the pager hardware directly and this wasn't just a pure cyber operation, that also points to the potential vulnerabilities in hardware supply channels, which have already been a constant issue of contention. This is a developing story and we will bring more details as they emerge.

No Flying Wing UCAVs Being Developed By U.S. Air Force While Chin...	The U.S. Air Force has no plans to acquire stealthy uncrewed combat air vehicles (UCAV) capable of operating with very high degrees of autonomy independently of crewed aircraft. The service is instead focused on buying large numbers of Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones that it plans to employ tightly tethered to piloted aircraft. This is in spite of the potential value of fully autonomous UCAVs, especially in a potential high-end end fight across the broad expanses of the Pacific against China, which is investing heavily in drones of this kind. The War Zone has been keeping a close eye on the still-widening UCAV gap between the U.S. military and its Chinese counterparts for years now. For a time, stealthy flying wing UCAVs looked on track to become a revolutionary new capability for America's armed forces before suddenly disappearing completely from the public eye in the United States without any real explanation more than a decade ago, as you can read more about in this past feature. Our own Howard Altman took the opportunity to ask Gen. David Allvin, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, about the issue yesterday at a roundtable for members of the media on the sidelines of the Air & Space Forces Association's (AFA) main annual conference outside of Washington, D.C. A look at the underside of a Boeing X-45A UCAV demonstrator with one of its internal payload bays open during a flight test in the early 2000s. The X-45A is one of a number of UCAV designs the US Air Force has experimented with in the past. USAF 'I would say that our conception for the Collaborative Combat Aircraft &#8230; it's part of the human-machine teaming,' Allvin said. 'What we think is the most value for the types of fights that the Air Force is going to be expected to participate with a joint force in is in this affordable mass, in this first increment of Collaborative Combat Aircraft, following on with some combination to be able to do either collective or disaggregated air superiority.' 'If there's a mission that we think is best served by something like that [a flying wing-type UCAV], we'll certainly look at investing in it,' he continued. 'But our focus right now is in these Collaborative Combat Aircraft to do the human-machine team.' The U.S. Air Force had been very active in the development of flying wing UCAVs, and publicly so, in cooperation with the U.S. Navy, around the turn of the last century. However, by the early 2010s, the Air Force's interest in such capabilities, at least in the unclassified domain, had completely evaporated. The Navy pushed ahead alone for a short time before it too abandoned its UCAV efforts. As already noted, this was a still very curious series of events. 'So, to do something that is independent of that [human-machine teaming], we have some capabilities,' Gen. Allvin did add, which might allude to ongoing work on some level in the classified realm or at least some degree of preservation of work from previous programs. The Air Force has continued to develop and field stealth flying wing drones configured for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions over the years. This includes Lockheed Martin's RQ-170 Sentinel and Northrop Grumman design commonly referred to as the RQ-180. A notional rendering of the Northrop Grumman drone commonly referred to as the RQ-180. Hangar B Productions Allvin's comments are very much in line with those from other senior Air Force officials when it comes to plans for future uncrewed combat aviation capabilities. As it stands now, the service has laid out a vision of operating large numbers of less complex and lower-cost CCAs in a completely different category from flying wing UCAVs, which will be very directly overseen by a controller in another aircraft. General Atomics and Anduril are currently working on two separate designs as part of the CCA program's initial iterative development cycle, which is expected to be the first of many such 'increments.' 'As we go forward, I expect there'll be a strike aspect to CCAs, as well, but initially we're focused on air superiority and how to use the CCAs in conjunction with a crewed aircraft to achieve air superiority,' Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall said at a separate media roundtable The War Zone and other outlets attended on the sidelines of the AFA conference yesterday. 'When we do the ops analysis, there's a really clear advantage of that.' A model of Anduril's Fury drone, which the company is now developing as part of the CCA program's Increment 1, on the show floor at this year's main annual AFA conference. Jamie Hunter 'I was just talking to our program manager downstairs&#8230; and we were talking about what we think the number of aircraft, CCAs, that can be controlled by a crewed aircraft [is]. And I initially started out with a range of three to five,' Kendall continued. 'We're talking about bigger numbers than that now. So we're moving towards greater reliance on uncrewed aircraft working with crewed platforms to achieve air superiority and to do other missions.' 'One of the things you have to have if you're going to use CCAs and have them be armed and &#8230; Lethal is that they have to be under tight control. And, for me, one of the elements of that needs to be line-of-sight communications. And I think that that's an important thing to have in the mix, secure, reliable line-of-sight communications. We're not going to have aircraft going out and doing engagements uncontrolled,' the Air Force's top civilian added. 'So the default, if they lose communications, would be for them to return to base, which takes them out of the fight. So we don't want that to happen. And when they do do engagements, &#8230; we want them under tight control. So I think the mix of crewed and uncrewed aircraft, I think, is going to be the right answer for the foreseeable future.' Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall (at left) and Chief of Staff of the Air Force Gen. David Allvin (at right) sign a model of General Atomics' CCA design on the show floor at this year's main AFA conference. GA-ASI Kendall also suggested that more narrowly focusing the design of a planned crewed sixth-generation stealth combat jet around the drone controller mission might offer a path to dramatically reduce the unit cost of those aircraft. He has left the door open in the past to the potential for this aircraft, which is part of the larger Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative, to be pilot-optional or even entirely uncrewed in the end but has also said a crewed design of some kind is still likely to emerge. The NGAD combat jet program is currently on hold while a complete reassessment of the underlying requirements is conducted, as you can read more about here. 'The F-35 kind of represents, to me, the upper bounds of what we'd like to pay for an individual [NGAD combat jet] aircraft,' the Secretary of the Air Force said yesterday. 'I'd like to go lower though &#8230; once you start integrating CCAs and transferring some mission equipment and capabilities [and] functions to the CCAs, then you can talk about a different concept, potentially, for the crewed fighter that's controlling them.' The original NGAD combat jet concept that is now under review has been expected to have a unit cost roughly three times that of an F-35. Kendall said that the Air Force could still pursue a design like that if the ongoing reassessment determines that to be the best course of action. The average unit price of an F-35 differs by variant and fluctuates regularly, but is generally pegged at between $80 and $90 million based on publicly available information. 'We are maturing our approach to autonomy so it's getting better,' Andrew Hunter, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology & Logistics, told The War Zone and other outlets at his own roundtable at the AFA conference yesterday. 'So it's not going to be static.' A rendering of a notional crewed sixth-generation stealth combat jet flying together with a trio of CCA-type drones. Collins Aerospace A rendering of a notional sixth-generation crewed combat jet flying together with a trio of drones. Collins Aerospace At the same time, 'we know two things about autonomy,' Hunter explained. 'One is laws of war require us to have, you know, human engagement in key decisions involving employment of weapons and other key decisions. So we have to have that. We have to have that human engagement, the ability to do that. The second is [that] we know that our ability to create systems that can operate autonomously and do missions well is something that is still maturing.' The Air Force's future vision of CCAs operating under the tight control of human operators in other nearby aircraft stands in stark contrast to a steady stream of UCAV developments, especially with regard to stealth flying wing types, in China in recent years. There is growing evidence that testing of one particular design, the GJ-11 Sharp Sword, is now significantly expanding in scale and scope. Work to date on the GJ-11 has already pointed to plans to operate the UCAVs in highly autonomous cooperative swarms, as well as teamed with crewed combat jets. Shipboard operations from aircraft carriers and big deck amphibious assault ships also increasingly look to be in the Sharp Sword's future.

Malan, situated in China’s far-western Xinjiang province, is a major drone testing hub. The War Zone recently reported on these and other Chinese UCAV developments in more detail, as you can find here. An annotated satellite image showing a pair of GJ-11 Sharp Sward UCAVs at China's Malan Air Base in July 2024. PHOTO © 2024 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION After we published that story it also came to our attention that other satellite images had caught a GJ-11, along with other military drones, at China's Daocheng Yading Airport. Located in the Garze Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of China's Sichuan province at an altitude of approximately 14,472 feet, Daocheng Yading is the highest civilian airport in the world. It is also less than 250 miles from the border with India, one of China's chief regional competitors. The dichotomy is even more striking considering the U.S. military currently uses its Chinese counterparts as its chief 'pacing threat' to plan against. More exquisite autonomous stealthy UCAVs would be more expensive and complex than the CCAs that the U.S. Air Force, as well as the U.S. Navy, is planning to acquire, but would also come along with greater lower observability (stealthiness), range, and payload capabilities that could be very valuable in a future high-end fight across the broad expanses of the Pacific. What is known about the Air Force's evolving CCA requirements has already pointed to significant debate about the desired range and other capabilities for those drones. Developing a true UCAV would also not preclude plans to field lower-tier CCAs designed to operate more closely together with crewed platforms. China's People's Liberation Army is also actively pursuing drones in CCA-like categories, along with ones like the GJ-11. H-6K drops multiple drones pic.twitter.com/EaQ9Hh2Cx8&mdash; 彩云香江 (@louischeung_hk) October 12, 2022 It's worth noting here that China is not alone in actively pursuing flying wing UCAVs, either. Russia, India, Turkey, and others are doing so, as well. In addition, China is also surging forward in its work on autonomous uncrewed capabilities, and not just in the air domain, and technologies to support those developments, especially when it comes to artificial intelligence and machine learning. There have now long been questions about whether the Chinese government will concern itself to the same degree as the United States and many other countries when it comes to the moral and ethical questions about autonomous systems capable of carrying out lethal attacks. These will continue to be pressing questions broadly as uncrewed platforms, even very low-tier ones, with artificial intelligence-driven targeting and other capabilities continue to proliferate, as The War Zone has explored in detail recently. As our own Tyler Rogoway wrote back in 2018: 'I can tell you that our potential enemies have no trouble defining these systems or embracing their game-changing capabilities, regardless of the moral ambiguity that may go along with it. What we are left with is potentially a missed opportunity of epic proportions. We could be spending considerable effort not simply trying to build a better fighter jet but to leap-frog the enemy in full by totally changing the game via investing in advanced unmanned air combat technologies. ' 'Instead it seems the USAF and the Navy are concentrating on keeping a human totally in the loop via manned-unmanned teaming and other concepts. This is fine for some interim applications but totally keeps the great potential of autonomous swarming UCAVs under lock and key, and therefore stunts their inevitable growth.' Six years later, the U.S. military's focus remains unchanged and the Air Force has now confirmed it has no higher-end UCAVs in the works, at least publicly, even as the gap with China in this regard continues to widen.

Everything We Just Learned About The Supersized AGM-158 XR Stealt...	Lockheed Martin has provided new details about their AGM-158 Extreme Range (XR) variant of the proven Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) family of munitions. JASSM now underpins much of the USAF's deep strike capabilities and a growing portion of the Navy and Air Force's air-launched anti-ship capabilities via its sister, the Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM). We have known the XR version of this weapon has been in development for some time, but this is the first time we have seen it and have gotten official details about its configuration. This unveiling came at the Air Force Association's biggest gathering of the year — Air, Space & Cyber 2024 — outside of Washington, D.C., an event widely used for just this kind of official disclosures and product promotions. John Hill, Lockheed Martin's general manager for air dominance and strike weapons said the following this morning about the AGM-158 XR: 'I would say that the '158 XR' really is a story of innovation and anticipating the needs of the warfighters. It leverages an existing production line, production processes… When we think of XR, think of that as extreme range. What it really does is it stretches the existing JASSM and LRASM family, that outer mold line, to give us more fuel, essentially, and that buys us the range that we need and that the warfighters need.' 'It leverages modularity. So while we're in doing modifications, we're going digital. We're leveraging the existing mission planning structure along with the existing software architecture. And as you know, JASSM or LRASM benefit from inline upgrades and fixes as they come down the production line. So for me, being part of a production line where you can incorporate changes that the warfighters ask for in stride is a pretty powerful thing. So this weapon leverages all of those really great things, and it's a great option for the Air Force to consider for the future.' The XR clearly sports the familiar trapezoidal cross-section and low-observable shaping of the JASSM and LRASM, but this new variant is substantially larger via a stretched fuselage. The XR is a substantial leap in proportions compared to its predecessors, allowing it carry much more gas, as well as a sizable 1,000-pound-class warhead. As it sits now, the land attack part of the AGM-158 family, which started service over two decades ago, is made up of the following: AGM-158A JASSM - baseline variant (no longer in production). AGM-158B JASSM-ER - baseline extended range variant. AGM-158B-2 JASSM-ER - 'replaces obsolete components and provides a new electronic fuze, a new Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, an upgraded Missile Control Unit (MCU), and enhanced software.' (according to the U.S. Air Force's Fiscal Year 2025 budget proposal); 'Obsolescence upgrade; increased computing capability, C++ missile control software. Foundational system upgrade for follow on 158B-3 and 158D variants.' (from a declassified Pentagon Modernized Selected Acquisition Report). AGM-158B-3 JASSM-ER - M-code GPS capability (still in development). AGM-158D JASSM-ER - 'Weapon Data Link (WDL) capability to re-target the missile, post-launch, against relocatable or higher priority targets during mission execution.' (again per the Air Force's proposed Fiscal Year 2025 budget; still in development). A JASSM about to be loaded on a bomber. (USAF) On top of this evolutionary roster is the anti-ship derivative of the JASSM, the aforementioned AGM-158C Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), which leverages nearly the identical airframe as earlier variants of the missile, but is optimized for attacking highly-defended ships in dense and very hostile combat environments. It includes an imaging infrared (IIR) seeker optimized for spotting, classifying, and precisely attacking vessels, as well as the ability to detect electromagnetic threats and either avoid them or use those signatures to help home in on and destroy them. A data link is also supposedly a key option, allowing LRASM to communicate in a networked battlespace, a feature that stands to vastly increase its lethality. This could also allow the missiles to talk to each other, providing cooperative swarming capabilities that can react to their environment and allow the missiles to autonomously work together to prosecute a target set or mission in conjunction with one another. An extended-range version of LRASM, also known as AGM-158C-3, which also incorporates other upgrades, is now in development. Lockheed Martin is specifically calling this new cruise missile variant AGM-158 XR, not the JASSM XR, as its vastly extended range could be adapted to the LRASM side of the portfolio, as well as the JASSM one. This would provide a survivable, very long-range maritime strike capability against highly-defended ships, which could be a critical capability to degrading China's anti-access/area-denial bubble that extends far off their shores. Further adapting and evolving existing munitions for this purpose has become a top priority and we are seeing the fruits of some of those efforts emerge as of late. The original A variant of the JASSM is thought to have a range of well over 230 miles (with some sources stating it is over 300 miles), while the ER variant boosts that dramatically to over 500 miles (around 575 miles by some accounts). The XR is thought to be able to reach Tomahawk-like distances of around 1,000 miles. This vastly expands the weapon's flexibility and unpredictability, while providing drastically increased survivability for its launch platforms, which are primarily aircraft, from fighters to bombers, and, in the future, even possibly cargo aircraft. It's also possible a ground-launched capability could emerge, too. LRASM has already been tested in the Mk 41 naval vertical launch system (VLS), as well. It's also possible that AGM-158 XR could trade warhead size to pack even more fuel inside, extending its range even further, although weight and balance issues may restrict just how much flexibility exists in this regard. The AGM-158 XR mockup at the convention. (Jamie Hunter) Lockheed's Michael Rothstein, vice president of air weapons and sensors, laid out a bit of the value proposition, including how this missile could reduce critical tanking requirements, during the Q&A with reporters today: 'You know, operationally, I would kind of put it in three things I think this brings relevance to… the first is a threat. We all know, the threats continue to evolve, and ranges continue to grow… When you can have more standoff [range] and still do the kind of exquisite targeting and get a survivable kind of weapon that JASSM/LRASM has proven itself to be at greater standoff [range], that's good for the warfighter.' 'The second benefit it does is that, as you were dropping things at increased standoff range, instead of having to drive in farther to the release point, you're now going back to refuel, rearm, and turn your next sortie. So it helps build operational tempo for the warfighter, because now they can generate more sorties in a day, put more mass across the target if they need to do that with other weapons, or other XRs, or whatever it may be.' 'The third&#8230; key operational standpoint, is refueling. We all know tanker bills and refueling is always a &#8230; factor for our aviation forces. You know, particularly in something like a China theater. In every theater tankers are always a hard thing. So again, if you have farther release points, that's less gas you got to drive. That's less [sic; fewer] tankers you need for that given mission set. And those tankers are then freed up, or that gas is freed up, to do other things.' 'Can't get into the specifics, but we've done the operational analysis of all of those things, on the ranges and the threat, the tankers, and certainly&#8230; there's benefit there to the warfighter that's very, very significant.' JASSM striking a mock target during an early test. (USAF) One of the AGM-158's top features is its low-observable skin coatings and underlying structures. Its ability to weave its way through the densest of anti-air umbrellas is the key selling point for the weapon. This also includes reducing its infrared and electromagnetic signature, all of which can be fused by advanced enemy air defenses to spot and potentially track stealthy targets. Lockheed Martin says that the spiral enhancements made to the AGM-158 family will be able to be adapted directly to the XR. Just the fact that this missile was designed to use the exact same production line is stated as a big advantage. The company is targeting a 1,100 missiles-per-year production goal in the not-so-distant future. The idea is that some of the missiles produced could be ERs and others could be XRs, depending on what customers order. It will be interesting to see what additional weight has been added to this larger AGM-158. All existing platforms that carry JASSM or LRASM can carry XR, aside from the F-16, according to Lockheed Martin. The F-15E and F-15EX are still well-suited host platforms, and the USAF's bomber force would certainly be able to accommodate many of them in their weapons bays and external pylons. F/A-18E/F Super Hornets can also fly with them, as well. But perhaps one of the most attractive applications could be using cargo aircraft to launch them via Rapid Dragon. These aircraft are more vulnerable than their bomber and fighter counterparts, so giving them hundreds of miles of extra standoff range could be a very enticing proposition. Another interesting tidbit shared at the press conference today regarding the missile's unveiling was that all AGM-158s going forward will have the semi-gloss black coating we see on the XR mockup and on some test LRASMs in the past. This is apparently for reducing the visual signature of the missile, according to Lockheed officials. Traditionally, at least for the most part, in-service JASSMs have been painted gray. A LRASM in flight during a test. (USAF) It's worth noting that the JASSM-related 'XR' derivative is something of a reused moniker. Nearly 20 years ago, Lockheed Martin was working on a missile with a similar name that was an outgrowth of JASSM. That XR concept had a similar range objective and was also longer than JASSM-ER by about six feet. The design featured a canard foreplanes, not a great addition to a missile built for low observability, although Lockheed Martin said at the time its impact was not a dealbreaker for the design. The current AGM-158 XR concept does not feature canard foreplanes. Regardless, that original XR variant didn't move forward and the JASSM-ER has remained the focus of ongoing production. As for when we may see a AGM-158 XR actually tested? That isn't clear. This is an internally funded initiative and moving it deep into flight test is still at least a couple years out. But considering the success of its predecessors and what the U.S. military and its allies could face in a fight across the sprawling Pacific, it would be hard to think that the Pentagon wouldn't have extreme interest in the extreme range version of JASSM/LRASM.

38,000 Russian Troops Committed To Kursk Counteroffensive: Report	Russia is stepping up its pressure on Ukrainian forces in the Kursk region, after launching its counteroffensive there last week. It’s now reported that as many as 38,000 Russian troops have been committed to the operation, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been forced to defend the incursion — which began in August — against mounting criticism. A report in The Financial Times cites a senior Ukrainian military intelligence official who assessed the number of Russian soldiers now involved in the counteroffensive, with some of these having been redeployed from southern Ukraine. Despite this, the same source says that the counterattack is 'still not large-scale,' and Russia will need to introduce more of its combat-proven assault brigades before making more significant gains. In the past, Zelensky has mentioned 100,000 Russian troops being required to fully repulse the incursion.

Around 460 square miles of territory were seized in the Ukrainian operation, which began on August 6. At this point, the biggest worry for Ukrainian commanders is very likely the fact that Russia has, so far, not diverted substantial forces away from the east of Ukraine, where Kyiv’s troops remain under significant pressure and continue to lose ground. In particular, the area around Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region, which is home to a major railway hub, has seen an uptick in Russian attacks. A detonation of a Russian BTR-82 in the Kursk direction.

Russian officials said that the counteroffensive launched last week quickly led to around 24 square miles of territory being recaptured, primarily on the left flank of the area occupied by Kyiv’s troops. Meanwhile, the Deepstate military analysis outlet, which has close links with the Ukrainian military, reports that Ukrainian troops are still pushing toward the north. Other reports claim that the Ukrainians are also making advances in the Russians’ rear, which could even threaten to trap them in a pocket against the Seym River.

But it remains to be seen whether Kyiv is able to sustain its gains, especially with Russia seemingly happy to play the long game to claw back its territory. The Latest In an interview with CNN, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Western military aid provided so far is not enough to equip 'even four out of 14' brigades that the country 'needs to be ready.' Zelensky didn’t provide details of where exactly those brigades are needed but did point to the adverse effect of the eight-month pause in deliveries of Western aid and how it has contributed to Russian progress. The Ukrainian president also reflected on the fact that despite more arms deliveries being approved, including a major U.S. package back in April, these have so far been slow to arrive. 'We moved [to use] what we had in storage, and whatever the reserve brigades had — [those brigades that] we need now [to fight],' Zelensky added. Of the brigades now fighting to defend the east of Ukraine, the Ukrainian leader said that 'half of them' are not fully equipped. Once again, shortages of ammunition are being especially keenly felt, Zelensky said, and more armored vehicles are also needed. In terms of the ammunition deficit, Zelensky claimed that the Russians are currently firing 12 times as many rounds as the Ukrainian troops. Western aid not enough to equip 'even 4 out of 14' underarmed brigades needed on the front, Zelensky tells CNN. The Kyiv Independent (@KyivIndependent) September 15, 2024 There are growing reports that Russia hopes to achieve a decisive victory in the war by the end of 2025 or the beginning of 2026. This is being driven by concerns that the Russian economy will start to face serious problems starting in the summer of 2025. In its recent analysis of the strategic situation, U.S.-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) argues that 'Russia will likely face growing challenges in the production and procurement of the materiel that Russian operations in Ukraine require, and the Kremlin will likely become increasingly reliant on foreign partners to meet its materiel needs.' In particular, these economic issues are expected to lead to 'likely medium- to long-term economic and force generation constraints' that would 'begin to significantly degrade Russia’s ability to sustain its war effort in Ukraine.'

Another factor around the same time period will be insufficient recruitment and the problem of whether the Kremlin decides to announce full mobilization, or otherwise reduce the intensity of its operations.

Future Stealth Tanker Plans Tied To NGAD 6th Generation Fighter’s...	The U.S. Air Force's still evolving requirements for a next-generation aerial refueling 'system of systems,' including a possible stealth tanker, will directly impact the service's reassessment of plans for a new sixth-generation stealth 'fighter.' The Next-Generation Air-Refueling System (NGAS) effort will also inform work on a second tranche of Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones. This comes amid broader and still growing questions about how the Air Force expects to achieve and maintain air superiority and refuel aircraft in flight, especially in and around highly contested environments in future major conflicts like one in the Pacific against China. Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall provides brief updates on NGAS and the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative during a keynote address today at the Air & Space Forces Association's (AFA) main annual conference just outside Washington, D.C. The overall NGAD effort currently includes the development of a crewed sixth-generation combat jet and the CCA drones, as well as a host of other related technologies, including new weapons, sensors, networking and battle management suites, and advanced jet engines. Work on an initial tranche of CCA drones, also known as Increment 1, is ongoing now, while requirements for a follow-on Increment 2 are being refined. The Air Force also confirmed in July that the NGAD combat jet program had been put on hold so that the service could take a deep look at the very core of what it wants out of that aircraft, as you can read more about here. Lockheed Martin Skunk Works 'During my tenure, we've gone through an evolution in our strategy to recapitalize the tanker fleet,' Kendall said today. 'The threat is now reaching out to longer and longer ranges. That puts both tanker and transport aircraft at risk over ever-increasing ranges. This is a particular problem for aerial refueling fighters within their combat radius ranges. ' The Air Force's current plan to modernize its aerial refueling fleets is to proceed with the planned acquisition of at least 179 Boeing KC-46 Pegasuses and 75 additional tankers in a traditional configuration. The latter aircraft are increasingly expected to just be more examples of the KC-46, a design that continues to be beset by major technical issues. Those acquisitions would then be followed by the NGAS family of systems, which could include a new crewed stealth tanker, uncrewed aerial refueling platforms, and/or other novel capabilities. Kendall has previously said that new more survivable aerial refuelers are not just desirable, but critical for succeeding future conflicts. The Air Force has previously stated a goal of having elements of NGAS start to enter service no later than 2040, if not well before then. In the meantime, the Air Force is already on the verge of retiring its entire fleet of KC-10 tankers and has been divesting KC-135s, as well. KC-135s, KC-10s, and KC-46s make up the service's current aerial refueling force. The three tankers that make up the US Air Force's current aerial refueling fleets. Left to right, a KC-135, a KC-46, and a KC-10. USAF All three of the US Air Force's current tankers. From front to back, a KC-135, a KC-46, and a KC-10. USAF 'Almost two years ago, we started an Analysis of Alternatives, what we now call NGAS, the Next-Generation Air-Refueling System,' Kendall continued in his keynote. 'We are about to complete that analysis, and we are folding that work into our reconsideration of both the NGAD [combat jet] platform and the next increment of CCAs.' The Air Force has previously raised the possibility of adding aerial refueling capability to one or more tranches of CCAs, primarily as a way to increase the range of those drones. The War Zone has highlighted in the past how this, in turn, points to a desire for greater performance and/or payload capabilities, and the potential for greater-than-expected unit costs. A US Air Force graphic depicting a drone being refueled in flight. USAF 'Late last week, we issued an RFI [request for information] to industry seeking input on mission systems for NGAS and potentially for the rest of the tanker fleet, as well. This is the first step in establishing competitive vendor pools that will evaluate and enable new approaches to refueling the joint force,' the Air Force Secretary added. 'Our intent is to have simultaneous &#8230; answers about the design concepts for NGAS, NGAD, and CCA Increment Two over the next few months.' The existence of NGAS has already been a clear reflection of the fact that existing non-stealth tankers would already face serious challenges getting anywhere near the tactical edge in a high-end fight, such as one with China in the Pacific. At the same time, the U.S. military's current tactical combat jet fleets are designed around the expectation that close proximity aerial refueling support will be readily available. Fuel-hungry stealth fighters like the F-22 Raptor and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter that would be operating out in front in higher-risk areas have added limitations when it comes to carrying additional fuel in draggy external drop tanks that would negatively impact their radar-evading capabilities. Stealthy drop tanks are now in development for the F-22 and have at least been proposed for the F-35 family in the past. Cropped into oblivion but this is the first time I've seen the LO fuel tanks and pods on the F-22 pic.twitter.com/srOgbeht1e&mdash; TaskForce23 (@Task_Force23) March 22, 2024 In addition, the distributed and dispersed concepts of operation that will be key to the survival of friendly air power in a major conflict scenario will demand that tankers of any kind operate very far forward. Larger aerial refuelers will also be limited in what forward bases they can operate from. As already noted, NGAS is a family of systems concept that is expected to include multiple tiers of capabilities that could be employed in a hub-and-spoke manner, with larger tankers operating further away from threats offloading fuel into smaller and more survivable platforms. Boeing is notably set to formally unveil a proposed Land-Based Variant (LBV) of the MQ-25 Stingray tanker drone it is developing for the U.S. Navy at the AFA conference, a development that Aviation Week was to first report. The company says work on this design, which has a longer overall wingspan and the ability to carry more fuel compared to the naval MQ-25 configuration, has been funded internally and is not officially tied to NGAS, at least as of yet. Scoop: @BoeingDefense is unveiling a land-based MQ-25 with a longer wingspan, targeting potential U.S. Air Force and international interest Brian Everstine (@beverstine) September 16, 2024 The Air Force also just recently awarded two contracts for work on new ‘buddy store’ podded aerial refueling systems that can offload fuel to aircraft that use the boom method. The pods could give the service's tactical jet fleets and other crewed and uncrewed aircraft the ability to turn into small, but still valuable organic tankers for forward-deployed forces. You can read more about what is known about the Small Hybrid Aerial Refueling Kit (SHARK) project here. In the meantime, questions about the complexities and costs of developing and fielding a fleet of new crewed stealth tankers are emerging. 'I haven't heard anybody recently tell me that they think that's remotely achievable within the timeframe and the budget,' an unnamed industry executive said, according to a report last week from Defense One.

JetZero A rendering of JetZero's blended wing body concept configured as a tanker, with F-35A Joint Strike Fighters flying in formation and receiving fuel. JetZero 'I will say that we are still looking at our existing capabilities with what we have for air refueling, but looking for ways to be more agile with that,' Gen. Kevin Schneider, head of Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), also said in response to a question from The War Zone at a separate media roundtable on the sidelines of the AFA conference today. 'We continue to expand Agile Combat Employment [concepts of operations] to find ways that we can move into austere airfields, you know, to disaggregate our force for survivability [and] re-aggregate it for lethality.' 'Getting gas into airplanes is a key piece of that.' the Air Force's top commander in the Pacific continued. '[But] in terms of changing how we put gas into airplanes in the air, we're not going down that road yet.' Gen. Schneider also noted that his command was looking at 'being more creative' in how it gets gas into aircraft on the ground, but did not elaborate. He differed on further questions about aerial refueling to Air Mobility Command (AMC), which oversees the bulk of the Air Force's tanker fleets. The Air Force's plans for the crewed NGAD combat jet have been facing similarly increased scrutiny over cost for months now. 'As I expect everyone here knows, we are re-evaluating the NGAD [combat jet] platform design concept. The initial impetus for this was a concern over the affordability of total program cost and high unit cost,' Secretary Kendall reiterated today. 'As the Air Force operational committee looked at the design concept, which is essentially an F-22 replacement, concerns expanded to include the cost-effectiveness of the operational concept, the implications of changes in the threat, the evolving nature of the most stressing operational environments and scenarios we have to plan for, and the maturation of technology, including the introduction of CCAs.' Gen. Kenneth S. Wilsbach, head of Air Combat Command, said in July that the Air Force currently has no formal replacement plan for the F-22 Raptor stealth fighter. The Raptors are in the process of receiving significant sensor and other upgrades, as well. A row of F-22 Raptor stealth fighters. USAF 'We plan to move quickly to conduct the assessment for a variety of reasons, including industrial base impacts and the fact that both the FY25 and FY26 [Fiscal Years 2025 and 2026] budgets still have to be finalized,' Kendall continued. 'But if I were going to make a change in the NGAD platform's requirements, now is the time to do so before the next major contractual commitment and the commitment to proceed towards production.' In terms of potential industrial base impacts, competing NGAD combat jet designs from Lockheed Martin and Boeing are already understood to be in development. Northrop Grumman publicly withdrew from the competition voluntarily last year, but has said more recently that it could seek to jump back in depending on what revised requirements look like in the end. In the past at least, the expected NGAD combat jet contract looked set to be a major windfall for the winner and its associated supplier base. Tying plans for the NGAD 'fighter' now directly to expectations about future aerial refueling capabilities can only raise new questions about what the future might hold for the program. Kendall has previously left the door open for a dramatic shift in requirements, including a reduction in emphasis or even elimination of the demand for the design to be crewed. The Secretary has also previously said he was 'absolutely confident' that work on a crewed sixth-generation combat jet of some kind would move forward, but his choice of language in this regard has been steadily evolving. How larger stealth tankers fit into the NGAS equation could have particularly significant impacts on the NGAD combat jet requirements. The new sixth-generation stealth aircraft could carry less gas, and be smaller and less expensive, as well as have higher performance, if aerial refueling support could be more assured in higher-risk areas. There would still be trade-offs and risks, as The War Zone has highlighted in analyzing the growing need for stealthy aerial refueling platforms in detail in the past. 'One thing I would like to make very clear: we are not walking away from the core United States Air Force function of providing air superiority. I'll say that again, we are not walking away from the core United States Air Force function of providing your superiority,' Kendall said today to great applause from the audience. 'We are looking at what we need in order to achieve our superiority in a manner consistent with the increased threat, the changing character of war, and [in] the most cost and combat-effective way.' A rendering of a notional sixth-generation crewed combat jet. Lockheed Martin A direct link between NGAS and CCA Increment 2 could also have major impacts on the latter effort. 'So what should Increment 2 be? Do not assume and it may not be just an evolution of Increment 1. It could be an entirely different set of missions. Could be [an] entirely different kind of an aircraft,' Andrew Hunter, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology & Logistics, said at the 2024 Defense News Conference earlier this month. 'And so part of that initial work is, again, starting with a large vendor pool, what are the good ideas out there? We’ll have some ideas [about] what we think Increment 2 needs to do as part of a broader force, and that’s part of this broader look at air dominance and how we’re going to deliver that.' The Air Force is still voicing a clear commitment to the broader NGAS and NGAD initiatives no matter how they might evolve going forward. Questions about how aerial refueling support will be provided in high-end conflicts are also now clearly emerging as a central factor in the service's planning for the future. 'We have a strong sense of urgency here. Our analysis must be adequate to support major decisions and to help us align our requirements, our acquisition strategies, and funding for these three programs,' Kendall said in his keynote, referring to NGAS, the NGAD combat jet, and CCA. 'Stand by for answers in the next few months.' Howard Altman contributed to this story.

Russia’s Kursk Counteroffensive Fully Underway	More than a month after Ukraine first invaded Russia’s Kursk Oblast, Moscow’s forces have mounted a counteroffensive to try and take back the hundreds of square miles they lost. Just how effective it has been so far is not quite clear, but indications are that Russia is making a serious bid to kick Ukraine out. The Russian Defense Ministry (MoD) claims its 'Units of the North' forces had reclaimed 10 settlements in two days in the area around Snagost, according to the BBC. That town is on the western flank of Ukraine’s salient. That is roughly in line with the dynamic control map produced by the Ukrainian DeepState open-source intelligence group. The map shows Russian forces have knifed through the salient, moving about six kilometers south from Korenevo to Snagost. The area in the blue is controled by Ukraine north of the border in Kursk Oblast. The area in the gray is contested. (DeepState screencap) Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has acknowledged that Russian forces have launched a 'rapid' counterattack but 'haven’t achieved serious success,' according to the Kyiv Independent. 'In the Kursk direction, the Russians have started their rapid offensive, and they want to use about 60,000-70,000 people there,' Zelensky said, according to the publication. He also said the counteroffensive 'is going in line with our Ukrainian plan,' the BBC noted. One Ukrainian officer told the BBC that the 'fighting is very tough and the situation is not in our favor as of now.' An indication of the ferocity of battle can be seen in the video below shot from the Russian perspective.

However, Russia began moving more troops and equipment into the region. The units included the 56th Air Assault Regiment to the west, the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade to the north, the 11th Separate Assault Brigade to the east, and the 488th Motor Rifle Regiment and 155th Separate Brigade of Marines to the southeast, according to DeepState. Russia also increased its airstrikes. The fighting grew more fierce and has turned into a full-blown counteroffensive. Ukraine is not entirely on its heels, according to the Institute for The Study of War (ISW) and at least one of its military units fighting there. 'Russian forces continued counterattacking throughout the Ukrainian salient in Kursk Oblast on September 12 but made only marginal gains, likely due to continued Ukrainian offensive operations and defensive counterattacks in the area,' ISW reported in its latest assessment.

As we noted nearly a month ago, Ukraine wants to move east through Tetkino and thousands of Russian troops are estimated to be stuck south of the Seim River thanks to a campaign of attacks on bridges. Those strikes continue as Russia attempts to build pontoon bridges across the River.

'The operational and combat situation remains difficult,' the Russian Senior Border Guard Telegram channel claimed on Friday. 'Yesterday, the enemy managed to consolidate its position in the area of ​​the village of Novy Put. After which the enemy made a dash towards the settlement of Veselove consisting of a tank and two armored fighting vehicles, the first attack was repelled. By evening, the enemy began to dig in near Veseloye, continuing the attacks. The enemy is actively destroying our UAVs, which complicates the reconnaissance and adjustment of our artillery. Border guards, together with units of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, are repelling enemy attacks. Heavy fighting is underway.'

The Kursk invasion was launched in large measure to try to draw Russian troops from eastern Ukraine, where they are within a few kilometers of taking several key towns. However, that advance continues, albeit at a much slower pace as Ukrainian forces too have dug in and reinforced their positions. More on that later. Even before the counterattack, things were getting difficult in Kursk, Ukrainian troops said. Three days before it was launched, CNN spoke with 14 Ukrainian soldiers from five different units who were deployed to Kursk as part of the incursion. All 14 said the Kursk invasion 'was a difficult operation with casualty rates on par with other parts of the frontlines. They said it was getting tougher, five weeks in, and some even questioned the decision to launch the incursion at a time when Ukraine was struggling to defend key towns and cities in the east of the country.' 'It will get more and more difficult,' one soldier said. 'There will be more artillery fire, more soldiers, and there will be very big and difficult battles, but we must do everything we can that improves our position. Ukraine, said the soldier, 'wants peace, but peace when we win, not when we lose. Russia is sending a lot of troops and artillery (to Kursk). We have a lot of guys who have been killed and we have a lot of destroyed hardware.' Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his troops to retake territory lost in Kursk by Oct. 1, a deadline that will be challenging to meet. Zelensky, meanwhile, has indicated he has no intention of a rapid withdrawal from Kursk. He has sent some of his best troops and equipment into Russia even as the eastern part of his nation buckled under a withering Russian advance. The coming days should provide a better indication of whether Ukraine's push into Russia was a bet worth making at such a critical time in the conflict. The Latest In the heavily contested eastern part of Ukraine, Russian troops are continuing their advance toward Pokrovsk. As we have frequently noted, the city is a key logistics hub for this region. It is nestled by important roads and bisected by a major rail line. Just a little under six miles from the city, Russia is pushing westward toward it, but there are indications that the massive offensive has slowed a bit. 'Over the past 24 hours Russian troops have occupied the village of Lisivka and pushed closer to Pokrovsk, about 10 kilometers distant,' Politico reported. 'As we can see, the Russians put everything in the direction of Pokrovsk,' Ukrainian army spokesman Dmytro Lykhoviy told the news outlet.'They don't have enough resources to conduct a massive offensive on several fronts at once, and this has been evident for the past few months.' Still, that town is in trouble and the Donetsk Oblast governor urged the remaining civilians to leave. 'The situation is difficult and will not get better soon,' Vadym Filashkin said on Facebook Thursday. 'That’s why I urge you again: evacuate! Evacuation is the only right choice for civilians!' Russian troops pushing toward Pokrovsk say the offensive force ranges from well-organized modern military units to undertrained troops sent out on assaults with minimal artillery support, no armor or aviation, and are heavily targeted by Ukrainian drones.

'On September 12&#8230; Four waves of assaults from 5:45 a.m. to noon on the positions of the battalions of our brigade should, according to the enemy's plan, break through the defense of the Ukrainian paratroopers,' the unit claimed on Telegram. 'Tanks, armored personnel carriers, infantry fighting vehicles, infantry on motorcycles - a total of 46 units of armored and not so armored vehicles fell on us. And the record was set! Such a number of destroyed and damaged enemy equipment in one day in the direction of responsibility of the 46th brigade has never really happened.'

'There is no change to our view on the provision of long-range strike capabilities for Ukraine to use inside Russia, and I wouldn't expect any sort of major announcement in that regard coming out of the discussions, certainly not from our side,' White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Friday. 'I also leave it to the Prime Minister to decide what he wants to talk about.' While there have been increasing indications that the U.S. will allow Ukraine to uses its Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) short-range ballistic missiles inside Russia and the U.K. will do the same with its Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missiles, those permissions have yet to be granted. In an exclusive interview with CNN, Ukrainian President Volodymry Zelensky continued pushing for the. U.S., the U.K. and allies to allow the use of those long-range fires inside Russia. 'Everybody is looking [for] the decision of the United States, everybody's waiting for sides' decisions, after that, they make decisions,' he said. 'And so, we wanted very much to use this weapon and just to attack these jets on the military bases, not civilians, infrastructure. Military bases.' Zelensky said he had meetings with U.S. officials and told them 'we waited too long. Now Russia [has begun] to move their jets from 100, 150km, 300 to 500km. After that, I will tell you. And that now we need more permissions. But now you will tell me, maybe we will give you 100 or 200, but for what? To destroy what if they began to move? So we're again, like with the packages, slow decisions and again, we can't win in such circumstances.' CNN’s Fareed Zakaria sat down for an exclusive interview with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (CNN) Russian President Vladimir Putin warned the United States and its allies not to lift restrictions on the use of these long-range weapons. 'We are not talking about allowing or not allowing the Ukrainian regime to strike Russia with these weapons,' Putin said Thursday in comments to propagandist Pavel Zarubin, according to NBC News. 'We are talking about deciding whether NATO countries are directly involved in the military conflict or not.' Putin said that the use of Western long-range precision weapons against Russia by Ukraine would signal direct NATO involvement in the war in Ukraine.

'We have $5.9 billion left in Ukraine Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA); all but $100 million of which will expire at the end of the fiscal year,' Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said in a statement Friday. 'The department will continue to provide drawdown packages in the near future and is working with Congress to seek an extension of PDA authorities beyond the end of the fiscal year.' So far, the U.S. has committed more than $56.6 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the beginning of the Biden Administration, including approximately $55.9 billion since the beginning of Russia’s all-out invasion on February 24, 2024, according to the Pentagon. (DoD) Russian drones attacking Ukraine have frequently landed on or crossed over the airspace of several nations. However, to date, only Russian client state Belarus has shot one down, an irony Zelensky chided NATO allies about. 'Only Belarus has distinguished itself by shooting down Russian drones,' Zelensky complained. 'I think it's simply humiliating for the strong democratic world.'

'We strongly condemn Russia’s attack on a commercial cargo ship in the Black Sea last night,' Bridget A. Brink said on Twitter. 'This escalatory attack is a blatant violation of international law that threatens global food security.' A Kh-22 supersonic cruise missile fired by a Russian Tu-22M3 Backfire bomber 'slammed into the port side of the bulk carrier MV Aya on Sept. 11 in a morning strike,' according to the Kiyv Post. 'Reportedly, the weapon was one of three launched by a trio of bombers flying over the Black Sea shortly after 11 a.m.' The Belize-owned, Turkey-operated Aya 'was carrying Ukrainian grain loaded in the port Chornomorsk and was en route to Egypt. At the time the Russian missile struck her, the Aya was in international waters some 15-20 nautical miles off shore. She had been travelling in convoy with other cargo vessels.' It was the first time a missile has struck a civilian vessel transporting grains at sea since the start of Moscow's invasion in February 2022, according to Reuters.

Overall, Ukrainian decoy-makers have revealed themselves to be notably skilled practitioners of this craft, with various mock-ups of armored vehicles, multiple launch rocket systems, air defense systems, and other items of equipment having appeared.

Russia Covering Aircraft With Tires Is About Confusing Image-Matc...	Russia putting tires on top of bombers and other aircraft was about confusing seekers with image-matching capability on incoming munitions, a senior U.S. military technologist has confirmed. This is exactly what The War Zone said was the most likely explanation for the tactic when it first emerged last year. A close-up of a Russian Tu-95 Bear bomber with tires on the wings and top of the center fuselage at Engels-2 Air Base, taken August 28, 2023. Satellite image ©2023 Maxar Technologies Schuyler Moore, U.S. Central Command's (CENTCOM) first-ever Chief Technology Officer, mentioned the Russian use of tires to disrupt incoming attacks on air bases during a broader live-streamed roundtable talk on artificial intelligence (AI) and related technologies that the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS) think tank hosted today. Before taking up her current role, Moore had been Chief Strategy Officer for U.S. Naval Forces Central Command’s (NAVCENT) Task Force 59, which is tasked with experimenting with integrating new AI-driven and uncrewed capabilities into day-to-day naval operations in the Middle East. A 'sort of classic unclassified example that exists is like a picture of a plane from the top, and you're looking for a plane, and then if you put tires on top of the wings, all of a sudden, a lot of computer vision models have difficulty identifying that that's a plane,' Moore said as part of a larger discussion about AI models and data sets. Russia was first observed using tires to help shield Tu-95 and Tu-160 bombers at the Engels-2 Air Base from attack in the fall of 2023. This followed numerous Ukrainian long-range kamikaze drone attacks on the base, which is situated some 300 miles from the border with Ukraine. Images of other types of Russian aircraft covered with tires subsequently emerged. Russian Tu-95 and Tu-160 bombers seen covered with tires at Engels-2 Air Base in Russia in 2023.

Before then, Ukraine's Air Force had also begun receiving virtually identical Storm Shadow and SCALP-EG air-launched cruise missiles, which also use imaging infrared seekers to find their targets in the terminal stages of flight.

Seekers of this kind are immune to radiofrequency electronic warfare jamming and also scan for potential targets to check against their pre-loaded data library passively making weapons equipped with them harder to detect in the first place. Other AI-driven targeting capabilities are now also starting to emerge on the battlefield in Ukraine. These are likely to keep proliferating, and on far less complex platforms that can be deployed en masse, as The War Zone has previously explored in detail. CENTCOM's Moore brought up the tire tactics as an example of why AI-driven targeting systems need to use models and data sets that are readily 'accessible' in various ways to users as close as possible to the tactical edge to be truly effective going forward. 'We're not saying that we need to have our own internal AI development team. What we need is for our users to better be able to engage with the models that exist out there,' she explained. 'So that means that they need to be able to label new data sets that they think are relevant to them. They need to be able to push those labeled data sets to then retrain a model to look for something different.' 'If you were able, in that single moment for a user to say, I identified that the adversary has changed what they are doing visually [with the tires], I am going to go back and start labeling to at least adjust for maybe I'm looking for a different type of plane shape, or I'm looking for a nuance that accounts for a change in coloration on top of the wings, that may be able to get me there,' she continued. 'But if it takes you six months to get to that answer, and then the next day, they said 'Oh, perfect. You didn't like tires? Okay, I'll put something else on top,' and it breaks the model &#8230; again, we are spending inordinate amounts of time on computer vision with very little to gain.' Moore's mention of 'coloration' here is also notable. Though she did not reference it directly, Russia has also been painting silhouettes of aircraft on the tarmac at air bases, again most likely to try to confuse imaging seekers and lure them away from real targets. There is at least one example of a submarine silhouette (which also had a fake sail structure) appearing at a Russian naval base for what is very likely the same reason. Last year, some surface warships in Russia's Black Sea fleet also began sporting new paint jobs that seemed similarly intentioned.

America's armed forces are currently focused primarily on preparing for future high-end fights, especially a potential one against China in the Pacific. As a result, there has been a notable resurgence of interest in camouflage, concealment, and deception capacities and tactics in the face of significantly growing Chinese intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities, particularly in space. AI has already progressed to the point where it is being used to help find objects of interest in publicly available commercial satellite imagery. 'Today, the adversary has migrated to kill webs that fully integrate multiple sensors [and] multiple 'bullets' [kinetic and non-kinetic effects] &#8230; against multiple simultaneous targets, all fully networked together &#8230; and all talking together through multiple communication paths,' U.S. Space Force Gen. Michael Guetlein, Vice Chief of Space Operations, said at the 2024 Defense News Conference just last week. 'Unfortunately, the adversary is capable of using these kill webs to hold our joint forces at risk across great distances, across multiple domains, and with persistence. This is a very sophisticated and challenging threat.' 'We have to be very sophisticated in our decoys, if you will,' Gen. David Allvin, Chief of Staff of the Air Force also said at another live-streamed talk at the Hudson Institute think tank back in August. 'I mean, you can’t just put [up] an inflatable F-35 and say, ‘Guess what? Everybody’s gonna think it’s an F-35.'' 'When you think of how advanced algorithms are, you need to be pretty sophisticated, otherwise that money will be worthless because the adversary will go, they’ll discount it immediately,' Allvin continued. 'How do you mimic pattern of life? How do you mimic a signature? And so we’re looking at all those ways to ensure that the things that we are doing are actually appropriate for the time.' It seems unlikely that American military aircraft will emerge covered in tires any time soon. At the same time, that Russian tactic, now confirmed to have been about confusing imaging seekers, reflects real issues that go well beyond the conflict in Ukraine.

MQ-9 Reapers Gathered In Florida, Simulated Fighting Over South C...	The U.S. Air Force brought together more than 30 MQ-9 Reaper drone squadrons for the latest iteration of the Reaper Smoke competition, scenarios in which included simulated missions over the highly strategic and tumultuous South China Sea. This is an interesting development in as much as there have been questions about the utility of the MQ-9 in that kind of context, although Air Force Special Operations Command, in particular, has been looking at ways of ensuring the Reaper is relevant in contested or denied environments. The South China Sea context in Reaper Smoke 2024 was brought to wider attention by @IntelWalrus on the social media platform X. A closer look at a photo published by the Pentagon’s Defense Visual Information Distribution Service (DVIDS) shows a computer monitor displaying a map that includes Mischief Reef, an atoll in the east of the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. AFSOC hosted an exercise for MQ-9 reaper pilots and operators at Hurlburt Field, featuring simulated missions & strikes over Mischief Reef in the Spratlys. 'Reaper Smoke 24' included 'tactical scenarios aimed to test their abilities and decision-making' such as the one pictured. pic.twitter.com/24O8lU0cHs&mdash; IntelWalrus (@IntelWalrus) September 12, 2024 Located around 130 nautical miles west of Palawan Island in the Philippines, Mischief Reef is claimed by China, Taiwan, and Vietnam, although it’s located well within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone (EEZ). However, China has controlled the atoll since the mid-1990s and more recently has used it to build a large artificial island, including a harbor, as well as an 8,675-foot runway, part of its efforts to assert claims over this and other disputed shoals in the South China Sea.

Photo by Ezra Acayan/Getty Images As for how Mischief Reef was employed as part of a scenario in Reaper Smoke is unclear, with the accompanying DVIDS text not making any mention of an Indo-Pacific angle to the competition. What we do know is that this was the fifth edition of the annual Reaper Smoke exercise, and it took place at Hurlburt Field, Florida, from September 5-6. It was organized there by the resident 2nd Special Operations Squadron.

U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Deanna Muir Senior Airman Deanna Muir Inspired by the Air Force’s famous Gunsmoke competition launched in 1949, Reaper Smoke sees MQ-9 pilots and sensor operators from across the Air Force take part in 30-minute tactical scenarios aimed to test their abilities and decision-making. According to a media release, the competing crews faced 'challenges that ranged from general tactical maneuvers to specialized skills requiring precise and advanced techniques, reflecting the evolving nature of modern warfare.' The 196th Attack Squadron from the California Air National Guard sealed the victory, but as well as the competitive rivalry between units, Reaper Smoke provides a platform for the exchange of MQ-9 tactics and strategies. 'When it comes to the fight of tomorrow, we’re all going to be working together,' Staff Sgt. Francisco Rivera-Monge, 2nd SOS MQ-9 sensor operator and combat operations noncommissioned officer said in an official media release. 'Understanding each other’s capabilities is the key to success when it comes to MQ-9 survivability and the contribution in the fight for tomorrow.'

Carly Kavish With briefings from leaders across the MQ-9 community, the competition will also have provided insight into how Hurlburt Field’s 2nd Special Operations Squadron and the broader Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) envisage using the Reaper in future contingencies. It’s here, perhaps, that the apparent focus on the South China Sea — for at least a portion of the competition — is notable. 'Air Force Special Operations Command is focused on specialized air power,' explained Col. Mark Jones, chief of the AFSOC Concepts and Capabilities Development Division. 'The MQ-9 inside AFSOC is focused on training the fundamentals — training airmen to be skilled and adapt to use the MQ-9 in ways we haven’t used it before, for the future.' One of the ways that AFSOC is planning to use the Reaper, especially in a conflict with China in the Indo-Pacific theater, or with other near-peer and peer adversaries, is the Adaptive Airborne Enterprise concept, or A2E. This is part of broader efforts within the command to adapt to the reality that future conflicts are likely to be fought against much more capable adversaries, after decades of counterinsurgency and counter-terrorism operations.

U.S. Air Force photo by Staff Sgt. Vernon R. Walter III Senior Airman Vernon Walter Above all, A2E plans to find ways to ensure the MQ-9 is relevant for future contingencies, by expanding its mission repertoire beyond the more familiar intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and strike operations. 'Adaptive Airborne Enterprise is vital to thickening the Joint Force kill web throughout the spectrum of conflict and continues to be AFSOC’s number one acquisition priority,' Lt. Gen. Tony Bauernfeind, AFSOC commander said earlier this year. 'Our Air Commandos are incredibly innovative, capable, and driven… they are bringing A2E to life. We will continuously develop the concept to full capability through multiple demonstrations over the next few years.'

The attached travel pod allows combatant commanders to use the MQ-9 Reaper to deliver vital supplies in a confined area instead of relying on a cargo aircraft. U.S. Air Force photo by Maj. Doniell Mojazza AFSOC’s development of A2E has been broken down into five phases, of which the first three were already underway as of January this year. They are as follows: Phase one, replacing the traditional stationary drone control system with a new A2E interface to create a much-reduced deployed footprint, optimized for austere locations. Phase two, developing a capability for a single crew to fly multiple MQ-9s. Phase three, developing a capability for a single crew to fly multiple types of drones, ranging from small Group 1 types like the RQ-11B Raven to larger Group 5 ones like the Reaper. Phase four, a single crew will control formations of drones from mobile and austere locations. Phase five, establishing new 'effects-based ISR units.' According to AFSOC, as well as drones, these units could include 'forward-deployed ground forces, cyber operators and space operators that can collaboratively employ UAS capabilities in permissive, contested or denied environments.' The first three phases of A2E were demonstrations conducted last year at Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico, in Exercise Talon Spear, hosted by the 27th Special Operations Wing. Last December, meanwhile, the A2E demonstrations were expanded to include a single drone crew controlling three MQ-9s via a single common control interface, as well as attaching and air-launching a Group 2 drone from an MQ-9A. The capability for one drone to launch and recover other, smaller drones in flight is something that the U.S. military at large is showing increasing interest in. It also has particular resonance in the Indo-Pacific, where long distances are the norm, airspace will likely be heavily contested, and the maximum number of assets will likely need to be brought to bear to achieve the desired effects.

Carly Kavish As we have explored in the past, the shift from U.S. military operations in almost exclusively permissive environments, towards future conflicts in contested and denied spaces, has led to a recognition of the vulnerability of the MQ-9 and similar platforms. This issue would likely be particularly acute in a future conflict with China in the Indo-Pacific. Even in Yemen, where the anti-aircraft threat is an order of magnitude lower than it would be in a war with China, several U.S. military Reapers have already been brought down, with Houthi officials claiming eight examples of the drone shot down since the start of the war on Gaza. Giving the Reaper the ability to act as a ‘mothership’ for other smaller drones, including ones with standoff sensor payloads, as well as loitering munitions, is one way to get around the problem and maximize its potential. Other survival measures that should help improve the survivability of the MQ-9 include using its own standoff sensors, making better use of intelligence, working with combined forces, as well as self-protection capabilities including electronic warfare pods and air-to-air missiles. An Air Force MQ-9 Reaper armed with an AIM-9X Sidewinder air-to-air missile. U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Haley Stevens www.twz.com Ultimately, A2E envisages an MQ-9 controller also being responsible for controlling swarms of drones and being able to have these operate from dispersed and austere locations. In this scenario, the Reaper would also be expected to function as a data transport node, ensuring long-range communications and establishing the mesh networks required for complex drone operations, including swarms. One potential threat to the MQ-9 is a budgetary one, especially now, with a raft of other big-ticket programs for the Pentagon to fund. If it’s determined that the Reaper is no longer so relevant, the program could be scaled back and further airframes withdrawn. This also helps explain why AFSOC and others are scrambling to find new ways to employ these drones in contested battlespaces. A similar issue currently affects another niche Air Force platform, the AC-130 gunship, as discussed in the video below. As to Mischief Reef, it’s not clear whether the presence of this location in a Reaper Smoke scenario implies that the Air Force is already looking specifically at options for operating MQ-9s in this area. However, it is notable that the U.S. military has stepped up its MQ-9s operations from the Philippines. A map showing Chinese military outposts in the Spratly Islands at the southern end of the South China Sea, as well as other non-Chinese facilities in the hotly contested region. DOD Reapers were deployed to the Philippines for the first time in April 2023, when a pair of MQ-9s from the California Air National Guard’s 163rd Attack Wing operated from the former U.S. naval air station at Subic Bay on the Philippines’ main island of Luzon. From here, the drones flew ISR missions during the annual Balikatan exercise. Meanwhile, tensions between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea have been notably high in recent weeks, with an uptick in maritime confrontations. These have been centered around Sabina Shoal, another disputed atoll in the Spratly Islands. Manila has repeatedly accused Chinese maritime forces of ramming its vessels, blasting them with water cannons, and firing flares toward its aircraft.

Beijing, however, claims large swathes of the South China Sea as its own, despite an international tribunal in the Hague rejecting its arguments. Tensions in the South China Sea, a strategically important waterway linking the Indian and Pacific Oceans, show no sign of dissipating, and, against this backdrop, it’s very interesting, at the least, that the Air Force is building training scenarios around the flashpoint of Mischief Reef.

Germany’s New HK416 Service Rifles Appear At Panama Test Site	What appears to be one of the first looks at members of the German armed forces with new 5.56x45mm Heckler & Koch HK416 A8 rifles, also known as G95A1s, has come from an unexpected source: the U.S. Army. With help from the service, the Germans have been testing the guns in very hot and humid conditions at a facility in Panama, as well as in the Arizona desert. This follows reports earlier this year that authorities in Germany watered down various requirements, including temperature-related ones, before selecting the HK416 A8 as the country's new standard service rifle nearly two years ago. The U.S. Army's Yuma Proving Ground (YPG) released a picture of German personnel with G95-series rifles at the site in Panama yesterday. The Germans also brought Accuracy International G22A2 and C.G. Haenel G29 sniper rifles and Heckler & Koch 5.56x45mm MG4 and 7.62x51mm MG5 machine guns, as well as new night vision goggles, to test there, according to YPG. Additional German small arms testing was carried out at YPG proper in Arizona. A member of the German armed forces fires an MG4 or MG5 machine gun during testing facilitated by the US Army at a site in Panama. A G95-series rifle is also seen at the right. US Army 'The Bundeswehr, the armed forces of Germany, has tested a variety of equipment at YPG and its constituent test centers in the past decade, from the PzH 2000 155mm [self-propelled] howitzer to the MG 5 machine gun and G29 sniper rifle,' according to the YPG release. 'This year, the Bundeswehr returned to test both variants of its recently adopted G95 assault rifle in the desert of Yuma, followed by testing at a Panamanian facility frequently utilized by U.S. Army Tropic Regions Test Center (TRTC). The G95 is based on Heckler and Koch’s HK416A8.' In December 2022, the German Federal Ministry of Defense announced that funding had formally been approved for the acquisition of its new Bundeswehr Assault Rifle System, or System Sturmgewehr Bundeswehr, based around the HK416 A8. In addition to the G95A1 with its 16.5-inch barrel, the new 'system' also includes a shorter 14-inch barrelled variant designated as the G95KA1. In 2022, the hope had been that German forces would start getting the new rifles by the end of this year and it is unclear to what extent this may have begun happening already. It's worth noting here that Germany's special operations community has already been armed with versions of the HK416 A7, designated as G95s, for years now. German personnel on a range in Panama with G95-series rifles. An individual with an MG4 or MG5 machine gun is also seen lying prone on a table in the background. US Army Interestingly, the picture from the testing in Panama shows G95s with two different types of handguards. One appears to use the increasingly popular M-LOK accessory attachment system from Magpul in the United States, while the other looks to feature Heckler & Koch’s proprietary HKey system. Both also have U.S.-standard Picatinny attachment rails. Pictures of HK416 A8s that Heckler & Koch has put out previously in relation to the Bundeswehr Assault Rifle System deal have all shown HKey handguards.

Heckler &#038; Koch The HKey handguard also looks to be similar, if not identical to ones found on German special operations G95s, as seen in the video below. The rifles seen in the picture from Panama also have ELCAN SpecterDR 1-4x adjustable optical sights, which the Germans separately announced in 2021 would be standard on all G95A1s and G95KA1s. One of the rifles is also seen with an additional thermal imager fitted. Aiming lasers and lights are visible on a number of the guns, as well.

Bundeswehr The different handguards do raise the question of whether all the guns seen at the site in Panama are actually A1 G95 types or if the final standard service rifle configuration is still being finalized. Whether or not the configuration differences are related to reported issues uncovered in previous testing is unknown. In January, German news magazine Der Spiegel reported that testing requirements for the Bundeswehr Assault Rifle System had been significantly changed in late 2022, ostensibly to help speed up the process of fielding the new G95A1s and G95KA1s. This involved allowing Heckler & Koch to use civilian rather than military-standard ammunition in testing and for that testing to occur under more controlled laboratory conditions, according to a classified report the outlet said it had obtained. No extreme hot or cold weather testing was reportedly conducted. 'Current testing by the army in laboratory conditions shows that the weapon doesn’t meet army standards when loaded with combat ammunition,' the report said, according to a subsequent story from the Telegraph newspaper in the United Kingdom. 'The army requires an assault rifle that is sufficiently accurate under real conditions with its combat ammunition &#8230; [but the German Defense Ministry] can no longer ensure this&#8230; due to a modified contract with the weapon manufacturer.' This is all eerily reminiscent of problems that the existing G36-series rifles in German service suffered after their adoption in the 1990s. Loss of accuracy in hot weather environments, as well as in the event of sudden rapid temperature changes, have been the most notable reported issues, which authorities in Germany have consistently downplayed. The G95A1 and G95KA1 are now in line to replace the G36. A member of the German armed forces armed with a G36 rifle in Niger in October 2022. Bundeswehr Per Der Spiegel, German authorities downplayed the potential issues arising from limited initial testing of the G95A1 citing the increasingly widespread use of HK416 variants globally, including with the U.S. Marine Corps and American special operations units, without any serious reported problems. The HK416 family has also been increasingly entering the public consciousness, especially since members of SEAL Team Six carried them on the raid that led to the death of Al Qaeda founder Osama Bin Laden in 2011. The HK416 at its core is a derivative of the U.S. AR-15/M16 family, but uses a gas-piston operating system rather than the direct impingement one found on its parent design. In a direct impingement system, propellant gas is siphoned off from the barrel during firing and funneled directly into the internal action of the gun. A gas piston system keeps the gas, and any particulate matter within it, away from the gun's main working components, reducing the chance of fouling. This can offer advantages when it comes to ease of maintenance and overall reliability. YPG's press release makes no mention of any of the reported issues surrounding the Bundeswehr Assault Rifle System, but sending G95-series rifles to Arizona and Panama would be in line with German government efforts to address the reported testing deficiencies, especially when it comes to very hot conditions. 'The test area was exactly what we were looking for,' Germany Sgt. Maj. Michael Diehl, said in a statement in the U.S. Army release. 'We had no problems with the testing of the weapons.' 'We go a lot of times to Almeria in Spain, but it is very hot there for just two or three weeks of the year and you can’t shoot tracer ammunition there,' Sgt. Maj. Ernest Tretow, another member of the Bundeswehr in the testing, also said. 'Here, everything was possible.' Germany's effort to adopt a new standard service rifle had already been mired in controversy with the cancellation of an initial deal with C.G. Haenel for MK556 rifles in 2020. Around that time allegations emerged that the MK556, and the preceding CR223 design on which it was based, was so similar to the HK416 that it actually infringed on Heckler & Koch's patents. German authorities subsequently said the decision was based on a revised analysis of the company's offer, which was subsequently deemed to be 'economically inferior.' No direct mention was made of the patent issues, which Heckler & Koch has since had success litigating in court, as being a factor. The C.G. Haenel MK556. C.G. Haenel All of this now comes amid a broader push to revitalize and modernize Germany's armed forces driven in large part by the new geopolitical environment in Europe that has emerged since Russia launched its all-out invasion of Ukraine. 'We must be ready for war by 2029,' German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius told members of the lower house of the country's parliament, or Bundestag, in June. 'We must provide deterrence to prevent it from coming to the worst.' The news of testing in Panama, as well as Arizona, shows Germany is still pushing ahead with its Bundeswehr Assault Rifle System plans, despite the reported issues.

Israeli Commando Raid In Syria Sends A Message To Iran That Its U...	Israel destroyed a secretive missile production facility in northwest Syria last week in an attack that included inserting special operations forces by helicopter to retrieve equipment and documents, media outlets are reporting. The new details shed light on an attack initially described as only an airstrike. Not only did the raid strike at the heart of the Iranian military presence in Syria, but it also sent a clear message to Tehran that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) can and will attack deep underground complexes with ground troops that it otherwise cannot destroy from the air. The raid, which took place September 9, 'obliterated' the facility, located in northwestern Syria near the Lebanese border, The New York Times reported, citing unnamed American and other Western officials. 'A number of people' were killed at the site, those sources said. It is located about 140 miles north of Israel.

Charles Lister (@Charles_Lister) September 12, 2024 The raid also included airstrikes on the sprawling site in Masyaf, which is tied to the Syrian Scientific Studies and Researchers Center (SSRC). Despite its name, the SSRC is actually a network of facilities across the country. According to the Times, independent experts, Israeli officials, and the U.S. government have described the SSRC's site in Masyaf 'as a center of weapons research and development, aided by the country’s ally Iran. Chemical, biological and potentially nuclear weapons are developed there, as are missiles used by Hezbollah, the powerful Iran-backed militia group in Lebanon that is fighting Israel.' The operation was carried out by the Israeli Air Force's elite Shaldag special operations unit, according to Axios. 'The Israeli special unit surprised the Syrian guards at the facility and killed several of them during the raid, but no Iranians or Hezbollah militants were hurt,' Axios reported, citing anonymous sources. 'The special forces used explosives they brought with them in order to blow up the underground facility, including sophisticated machinery, from inside, two sources said.' An above-ground view of the facility that was attacked and destroyed by Israeli commandos. (Google Earth) Since 2017, Israeli airstrikes have targeted facilities at Masyaf multiple times. Between 2018 and 2022, an S-300 surface-to-air missile system Russia ostensibly gifted to the Syrian government helped guard the site. 'The Iranians began building the underground facility [at Masyaf] in coordination with Hezbollah and Syria in 2018 after a series of Israeli airstrikes destroyed most of the Iranian missile production infrastructure in Syria,' according to Axios' report today. The decision 'to build an underground factory deep inside a mountain in Masyaf [was] because it would be impenetrable to Israeli air strikes,' Axios wrote. 'The sources claimed the Iranian plan was to produce the precision missiles in this protected facility near the border with Lebanon so that the delivery process to Hezbollah in Lebanon could take place quickly and with less risk of Israeli airstrikes.' The Israeli raid on the missile production facility took place 140 miles north of its border. (Google Earth image) The new subterranean facility was discovered by Israeli intelligence and monitored for the past five years under the code name 'Deep Layer,' according to Axios. 'The Israelis realized they would not be able to destroy the facility with an airstrike and would need a ground operation,' one of the sources told the publication. An elite IDF unit conducted a highly unusual raid in Syria earlier this week and destroyed an underground precision missile factory that Israel and the U.S. claim was built by Iran, according to three sources briefed on the operation. My story on @axios Barak Ravid (@BarakRavid) September 12, 2024 The Israeli military 'considered conducting the operation at least twice in recent years but it wasn't approved because of the high risk, one source said,' Axios added. The fact that Israel executed such a risky operation shows its willingness to put troops on the ground in order to neutralize a major Iranian facility it cannot otherwise destroy using conventional weapons from the air. Israel lacks the ability to be able to destroy deeply buried fortified installations, including critical facilities related to Iran's nuclear program, such as the enrichment site at Fordow. The U.S. military potentially has a capability to strike these sites from the air, but even that is not certain. Barring the use of nuclear weapons, Israel's bunker busters, while capable, cannot reach deep enough to take these sites out. As we have discussed multiple times, the IDF would have to insert special operations forces with unique training on long-range, extremely risky raids in order to physically access these facilities and destroy them. Unconventional means, including nuclear contamination, may be feasible but doing so would highly controversial and problematic in its own right. US special operations forces during training. DOD While Iran is markedly farther from this site in Syria, Israel has had years to plan for executing such long-range missions and has shown its ability to operate even in significant numbers inside the heart of Iran for deep espionage purposes. Still, executing such an operation against a major installation in Iran would be far more challenging. But while the risks would be much higher, the stakes would be even more disproportionate. would be the stakes. With all this in mind, it's very likely that we just saw a glimpse of how the IDF could employ its elite special operations forces if it were to try to eliminate Iran's nuclear program, or at least drastically degrade it. While destroying this site and garnering critical intelligence were the key goals of the operation, sending a stark message to Iran about its ability to access even the most hardened facilities deep in a hostile area was clearly also a factor in the operation. Before the revelations about the ground component of Israel's operation, reports about what happened in Masyaf earlier this week had presented it as yet another airstrike on the site. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) a U.K.-based organization tracking conflict in Syria, had said the strikes hit 'an area containing a scientific research institute where work on developing short- and medium-range precision missiles is conducted,' the Times reported. You can read more about Hezbollah’s massive arsenal of stand-off weapons in our deep dive here. As we noted in 2019, the facility had also been responsible for Syria’s chemical and ballistic missile programs, as well as other advanced military research. It has come under attack before. Area residents unwittingly videoed the helicopters used in the strike.

'On Sunday, the head of U.S. Central Command, Gen. Michael E. Kurilla, visited the underground war room of the Israel Defense Forces’ Northern Command, where he was presented with the military’s operational plans for Lebanon, according to the Israel Defense Forces,' the publication wrote. Local Syrian media at the time also initially reported what had happened as being purely airstrikes.

It also caused 'material damage to the infrastructure, electricity networks, water, telephone, sewage lines, roads and machinery.' The raid came as Hezbollah and Israel continue to exchange fire along the border with Lebanon. Last month, Israel launched a preemptive attack against Hezbollah targets in Lebanon That was in anticipation of an expected strike from the jihadi group for the July 30 assassination of Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut It was also launched against the backdrop of a still looming Iranian retaliation attack in response to the July 31 assassination in Tehran of Ismail Haniyeh, the top political leader of Hamas. While Iran had threatened to hit Israel, that has yet to happen. This week, the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt and its strike group left the Middle East region, departing for the INDPACOM area. That left the region with the normal presence of just one carrier strike group - the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group. The Pentagon’s top spokesman sidestepped a question of whether moving the Roosevelt strike group is an indication that the U.S. believes the threat from Iran has died down as time has passed. 'Iran has indicated that they want to retaliate against Israel, and so we're going to continue to take that threat very seriously, and we're going to continue to maintain a robust presence in the central command and European Command, AORs, and so that's not going to change,' Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters, including from The War Zone, Thursday afternoon. Whether this attack changes Iran's calculous or spurs Hezbollah to ramp up its attacks is unknown at the moment. While this attack was likely a setback for Hezbollah and Iran, just how badly it hurt is also unclear. The coming days might provide an answer to retaliation strikes, but it might be some time before we learn the scope of the damage this caused.

Russia Now Using Thermite-Spewing ‘Dragon Drones’ To Torch Ukrain...	Russia has entered the 'dragon drone' fray, launching its own thermite-spewing aerial weapons over Ukrainian troops. The development comes about a week after videos first emerged on social media showing Ukraine’s use of these adapted unmanned aerial vehicles over Russian troops ensconced in treelines and trenches. Thermite, which has primarily been used in grenades and artillery shells, among other applications, is a combination of oxidized iron and aluminum that burns at about 4,440 degrees Fahrenheit. The drones attack by dispersing the compound over treelines and other foliage under which an enemy seeks cover, as well as into trenches. Burning growth away reduces where the enemy can hide, increasing their exposure. By deploying it where troops are hiding, including in trenches, thermite can kill anything exposed. It can also choke off oxygen to and burn those not directly in contact with it. A video published on Telegram by Moscow politician and military journalist Andrey Medvedev shows Russian troops deploying their dragon drone. It is the first such video to emerge. In it, one soldier is seen attaching a canister purportedly containing thermite to a first-person view (FPV) drone. It is then launched, reportedly toward a Ukrainian position. The video then shows an operator’s view of the drone over the treeline followed by another drone’s view of it dispensing the burning substance over Ukrainian troops. A week later, Russia started using its 'dragon drones', armed with thermite, against Ukrainian positions. pic.twitter.com/opDNRwTI5M&mdash; Julian Röpcke (@JulianRoepcke) September 11, 2024 'Meanwhile, Russian drone pilots (hooligans, really) from Omut Group are filming the third season of ‘House of the Dragon’ somewhere in the vastness of the' special military operations, Medvedev wrote in a post filled with references to the dragon-lore-loving ‘Game of Thrones’ television series. 'A man in a mask plays Prince Daemon Targaryen. A copter with a thermite charge plays the dragon. A Ukrainian stronghold plays the castle of Harrenhal in landing.' Unlike the Ukrainian dragon drones captured on video, the Russian version emitted mostly a shower of sparks with very little real damage seen. 'Jokes aside, war is increasingly becoming a drone war,' he wrote. 'And incendiary drones are getting on video more and more often. At this point, the result of the drone's work is not very obvious. But in the end, the landing burned out completely. Just as Prince Daemon said. ‘Dreams didn’t make us kings. Dragons did.’' Russian dragon drone spews thermite over a Ukrainian position. Twitter screencap Russia has a long history of using thermite weapons. In 2012, it fired cluster munitions filled with the compound at targets in Syria. It has also used thermite devices in Ukraine since the early days of the all-out war. You can see one such instance in the following video. Bakhmut, Russian shelling with 122mm Grad 9M22S incendiary rockets. pic.twitter.com/7yIUp7Pozm&mdash; OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) December 16, 2022 Ukraine had thermite weapons before the dragon drones as well, according to Human Rights Watch. The organization said it 'reviewed visual evidence showing that there were at least 82 attacks in Ukraine using surface-fired incendiary weapons between February 2022 and April 2023.' Those attacks were spread out across seven Ukrainian regions. 'At this time, it is not possible to attribute responsibility for specific attacks, but Russia and Ukraine both possess the same types of incendiary weapons, including 122mm Grad rockets that deliver incendiary weapons,' the organization stated. Several Ukrainian Telegram channels bemoaned the new Russian weapon. 'Just another reminder that the enemy learns very quickly!' the Brothers in Arms Telegram channel wrote. Russians 'have already copied our Dragon drone and are now burning our positions.' 'The Russians are quickly copying and learning, and the battlefield is increasingly resembling a drone war,' the Sofa Assault Brigade Telegram channel chided. The following video shows a Ukrainian dragon drone working against a Russian treeline position. Now the 3rd Assault Brigade also uses the Dragon drone against russian positions. pic.twitter.com/e8PQko4QRz&mdash; WarTranslated (Dmitri) (@wartranslated) September 12, 2024 Evidence emerged last week that Russia was tinkering with its own thermite-dropping drone, however, it appeared at the time to offer far more limited battlefield effects A video posted by the Ukrainian Landmines and Coffee Telegram channel purported to show one such effort. It used 'ignition elements from a 120 mm mortar mine,' Landminds and Coffee said. The mortar shells contain thermite. The 62-second video appeared to show a demonstration of the technology. The drone hovered a few feet off the ground, emitting a torrent of fire and dropping likely thermite-containing submunitions. They created a small fire when hitting the ground. The video, which you can watch below, ended with the drone rising higher before crashing in flames. The Russians have been attempting to develop their own version of Dragon’s Breath, but the results so far are more of a baby dragon than Drogon in Game of Thrones.2/2 pic.twitter.com/hoVY4f7cBe&mdash; Roy (@GrandpaRoy2) September 3, 2024 This new drone weapon application, now deployed in combat by both sides, differs from previous ones as it provides wide-area effects in a way no other can, while also doing so with incredible precision and no risk to the operator. One drone can do immense damage on a thermite-spewing run, compared to far more limited effects usually associated with small weaponized drones. The psychological angle to this weapon is also substantial. That Russia is now using dragon drones is no surprise. This war has served as a real-world laboratory for weapons development, especially drones, and each side rapidly learns from the other. The lessons learned extend far beyond Ukraine. Militaries across the world have taken notice of these new battlefield dynamics and it would not be surprising, either, to see other nations develop their own dragon drones.

ATLAS Uncrewed 'Combat Wingman' Fighting Vehicle Unveiled	BAE Systems has launched its new uncrewed ground vehicle, or UGV, the Autonomous Tactical Light Armor System (ATLAS) Collaborative Combat Variant (CCV), a roughly 11-ton 8&#215;8 vehicle, developed in Australia, and pitched as a 'combat wingman' with the potential for a high degree of autonomy. Armed with a powerful 25mm Bushmaster cannon, the vehicle is the latest addition to a growing number of UGVs that are designed to provide more flexibility to ground forces’ commanders, primarily by reducing the risks that personnel are exposed to on the battlefield. Unveiled at the Land Forces 2024 exposition in Melbourne yesterday by the company’s BAE Systems Australia subsidiary, the ATLAS CCV is described as a 'cost-effective, modular, 8&#215;8 UGV.' It’s a design that fits into the manufacturer’s vision of a future battlefield that will 'involve a mix of autonomous, semi-autonomous, and human-machine teams, generating combat mass and removing soldiers from many of the most dangerous tasks.' By adding uncrewed platforms like the ATLAS CCV to ground forces, BAE Systems argues that overall costs will be driven down, with UGVs being cheaper to acquire and operate (not least, since they require a smaller personnel footprint). At the same time, the company envisages the ATLAS CCV as very much an adjunct to crewed platforms like tanks and infantry fighting vehicles. The Autonomous Tactical Light Armor System (ATLAS) Collaborative Combat Variant (CCV). BAE Systems Core design principles in the ATLAS CCV include modularity so that it can be adapted for different missions and upgraded through its service life. Perhaps most significant, however, is the concept of autonomous operations, with BAE Systems outlining missions in which the ATLAS CCV will be driven by an 'autonomy system' that will be able to avoid obstacles, plan routes, and make 'tactical decisions.' Those tactical decisions will not include firing weapons, with the ATLAS CCV’s gun turret including a ‘human-in-the-loop’ targeting system. 'We’ve developed the ATLAS vehicle to give soldiers the advantage on the modern battlefield,' explained Andrew Gresham, Managing Director, Defense Delivery at BAE Systems Australia, in a company media release. 'This has resulted in an autonomous platform that will deliver the dull, dirty, and dangerous tasks expected in a combat environment.' BAE Systems Developed in Australia, the ATLAS is already being pitched to the Australian Army, with the demonstrator wearing the service’s camouflage colors. The Australian Department of Defense has been an enthusiastic proponent of uncrewed systems, especially in the air domain, but increasingly also at sea. Now, BAE Systems is trying to capitalize on interest in these emerging technologies in the land warfare branch. 'We have proven expertise in autonomous technologies, built on more than 30 years of complex autonomous projects,' Gresham added. 'We’re excited that this is the first UGV of its kind to be developed in Australia and look forward to working with our industry partners to deliver this capability for our customers.' Looking around the vehicle, one feature that immediately stands out is the Vantage Automated Turret System (ATS), billed by BAE Systems as being 'lightweight, affordable, and highly automated' and armed with a low-profile 25mm M242 Bushmaster cannon. Vantage ATS is specifically designed for use on uncrewed platforms and its integration on the ATLAS CCV makes this a notably hard-hitting UGV and one that is suitable for assault missions. Indeed, the power of the Bushmaster cannon, which has an effective range out to around 1.5 miles, means the ATLAS CCV will be able to take on infantry fighting vehicles, but the war in Ukraine has also once again demonstrated the Bushmaster’s effectiveness against tanks, as well. The ATLAS CCV’s fully stabilized 25mm gun has a dual ammunition feed system, with a ready-use ammunition capacity of 260 rounds. Two separate types of ammo, such as armor piercing and high explosive, can be loaded and toggled between thanks to its dual feed system. Other more offensive roles envisaged for the vehicle include counter-drone and indirect fire support using a 120mm automated mortar system. The ATLAS CCV is armed with a low-profile 25mm M242 Bushmaster cannon. BAE Systems The 8&#215;8 wheeled configuration chosen for the ATLAS CCV provides a good balance of speed and mobility on and off the road while ensuring that the vehicle is also easily transportable. The UGV’s dimensions are tailored to fit inside a standard 20-foot ISO container or 20-foot ISO flat rack and it can be transported by aircraft and landing craft. Once deployed, the ATLAS CCV is expected to undertake a variety of roles, both in a standalone capacity, like the aforementioned assault missions, but primarily in support of crewed platforms. In this way, the ATLAS CCV should act as a force multiplier, including supporting other combat vehicles on the battlefield by transporting ammunition, fuel, spares, and other supplies, for example. Another role outlined for the ATLAS CCV is reconnaissance, which the baseline vehicle will be able to perform thanks to a sensor suite that includes a multi-spectral automatic target detection, tracking, and classification system. In this way, the ATLAS CCV could scout ahead of crewed fighting vehicles, venturing into more dangerous areas to find targets that it could then engage itself, or provide coordinates for crewed platforms to attack. As well as operating like a more traditional armored scout, BAE Systems describes the vehicle as taking on other surveillance missions, including as a 'leave-in-place ‘sentry’ that can detect and track threats and hand these off to other combat assets,' and conducting electronic surveillance. Mirroring the emerging air power concepts in which ‘loyal wingman’ drones work in collaboration with crewed combat aircraft, the ATLAS CCV is also being pitched as a 'combat wingman,' in which it will serve as a companion for crewed combat vehicles. Here, again, the ATLAS CCV would be expected to take on more dangerous missions on behalf of crewed ground forces, including flank security, target identification and engagement, combat reconnaissance, and direct fire. For these sorts of missions, the vehicle’s combination of firepower, compact size, and high mobility are seen as key selling points. The ATLAS CCV’s mobility is claimed to be sufficient for it to work as a combat wingman for crewed tracked vehicles as well as wheeled ones. Concept artwork from BAE Systems shows two ATLAS CCVs working alongside a formation of crewed main battle tanks. BAE Systems The manufacturer has also provided details about the degree to which the ATLAS CCV will operate autonomously. 'The system is capable of uncrewed dynamic vehicle behaviors such as accepting real-time control from a user (akin to remote control), autonomous geometric path following (a string of waypoints defining a path the vehicle follows), and path generation to avoid obstacles and navigate complex environments such as bushland,' BAE Systems says on its website. For this, the vehicle relies on the combination of an advanced sensor suite, which feeds data to the autonomy system ‘brain’ to enable vehicle self- and situational awareness. This includes identifying, classifying, and understanding the environment around the vehicle in real time and formulating appropriate responses so that it can complete its mission. The autonomy system also ensures that the ATLAS CCV remains in secure communication with other crewed and uncrewed assets. This should allow some degree of teaming, with formations of the UGVs working together in a concept that broadly echoes aerial and naval drone ‘swarms.’ This would mean multiple ATLAS CCVs could be used in combined assaults, for example, multiplying their effect and having a much better chance of overwhelming hostile forces. At this stage, however, it’s not clear whether all of the vehicle’s functions other than operating the gun turret will be executed fully autonomously or if a human will still be in the loop somewhere, at least giving higher-level instructions. Also unclear is whether a human operator will be able to control the vehicle beyond the line of sight, or if a line-of-sight communications link will be required. Regardless, any degree of autonomous capability in the ATLAS CCV will at least help alleviate the workload on any human 'quarterbacks,' too. Several subsystems in the vehicle are common to those found on existing Australian Army platforms, including the 25mm Bushmaster that is found on the Australian Light Armored Vehicle (ASLAV), as well as Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, U.S. Marine Corps LAVs, and others. Meanwhile, the Cummins ISB six-cylinder diesel engine and Allison 3000 automatic transmission, both of which are also used in the Supacat HMT high-mobility vehicle. Australian Army soldiers from the 3rd Brigade in an ASLAV as part of Exercise Brolga Run 2024. Australian Department of Defense SGT SUSANNA BEYER While the Australian heritage of the ATLAS CCV should position it well for potential domestic orders, it’s meanwhile the case that the concept of cannon-armed UGVs is becoming more popular in the West. At the same time, Russia and China are also working on similar kinds of platforms. The U.S. Army recently conducted the first live-fire testing with one of its prototype 30mm cannon-armed Ripsaw M5 unmanned mini-tanks, as you can read about here. A Ripsaw M5 unmanned ground vehicle at Fort Dix, New Jersey, during testing in 2021. U.S. Army Although the Ripsaw M5 is tracked rather than wheeled, it’s intended for a broadly similar category of missions to the ATLAS CCV. The U.S. vehicle is similarly intended to work closely with crewed platforms, as demonstrated when it was operated from a control station installed inside a modified Bradley infantry fighting vehicle in a combat wingman-type role. Like the ATLAS CCV, the Ripsaw M5 is designed to accommodate a wide array of payloads with relative ease and falls into a broadly similar weight category, at around 10.5 tons, although the tracked platform implies an overall weight penalty compared to the wheeled configuration used in the BAE Systems design. Broadly speaking, the ATLAS CCV, Ripsaw M5, and other UGVs, like the tracked Milrem Type-X, fit into a weight class of between around 10-12 tons. It is also worth noting that the Australian Army’s crewed ASLAV tips the scales at around 13 tons. As for the U.S. Army’s Mission Enabling Technologies Demonstrator (MET-D) vehicle, as the adapted Bradley drone controller is known, this provides one idea as to how the ATLAS CCV might be employed as part of a crewed/uncrewed concept. The U.S. Army’s Mission Enabling Technologies Demonstrator (MET-D), a modified Bradley Fighting Vehicle. Persistent Systems The MET-D is a mobile control center for UGVs although it notably has an array of additional capabilities, including an advanced communications and data-sharing suite and cameras positioned around the hull to improve situational awareness. U.S. Army tests have demonstrated that the MET-D can control two UGVs, with the entire trio operating as a single team. One focus of U.S. Army studies in this area has been on the degree to which it might want its future UGVs to be attritable — indicating that they are cheap enough for commanders to be willing to commit them to missions where the risk of losing them would preclude the use of more expensive platforms. Notably, the U.S. Army has talked of wanting its medium UGV — the category into which the Ripsaw M5 falls — to be 'durable' rather than attritable, while the light UGV will fall into the attritable category. It’s not clear whether BAE Systems sees the ATLAS CCV as being an attritable platform, although it’s certainly expected to be lower cost, at least compared with crewed vehicles of similar size, weight, and capabilities. The U.S. Army has also outlined using its medium UGVs under the direct control of human personnel, although it expects an increasing level of autonomous capabilities to be introduced as time goes on. The same should be possible for the ATLAS CCV, too, based on how BAE Systems describes its levels of autonomy.

Russian Su-30SM Flanker Crashes In Black Sea, Ukraine Says They S...	The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense has published a video that it claims shows the destruction of a Russian Su-30SM Flanker multirole fighter, which it says was brought down by a shoulder-launched surface-to-air missile over the Black Sea. The engagement appears to be part of the latest round in the battle to control oil and gas platforms close to Russian-occupied Crimea and reinforces the tactical advantage that these can provide. #працюєГУР Піке на глибину ― розвідники у Чорному морі знищили російський Су-30СМ Під час операції в акваторії Чорного моря воїни спецпідрозділу ГУР МО України знищили російський бойовий літак Су-30СМ влучанням з ПЗРК. pic.twitter.com/toqbmJGHxO&mdash; Defence intelligence of Ukraine (@DI_Ukraine) September 12, 2024 Ukrainian reports suggest that the Su-30SM — operated by Russian Naval Aviation — was brought down while attempting to attack an oil platform in the Black Sea yesterday.

It’s more unusual still for them to be shared on official channels by the ministry. In this instance, however, a Ukrainian surveillance drone operating in the vicinity of the engagement recorded some of the last moments of the two-seat Russian fighter. Unconfirmed reports suggest that the drone used to monitor the engagement was a Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2, a type widely used in the opening months of the conflict but much less frequently encountered since then, although they have been active over the northwestern Black Sea throughout the conflict. Creedence to the Ukrainian claims is given by accounts on unofficial Russian channels, including some closely associated with the Russian Armed Forces, which also confirm that a Su-30SM was lost on a combat mission in this area at the same time.

The same source says the fighter had just launched one or more Kh-31P (AS-17 Krypton) anti-radiation missiles when it went missing. The missiles were apparently directed against (presumably air defense) targets 'in the Odesa region.' A Kh-31 (AS-17 Krypton) missile mockup. Boevaya mashina/Wikimedia Commons Boevaya_mashina The Ukrainian Militarnyi defense website says that the Su-30SM had 'fired four missiles out of six available, after which it disappeared from the radar screen.' Monitor claims that Russian search and rescue operations were underway as of yesterday, at the site of the fighter’s disappearance — around 40 miles from the port of Zaliznyi. This account says there is no information about the fate of the two crew members. According to the account from the GUR, the Russians lost contact with the Flanker at around 5:00 a.m. on September 11, several hours later than claimed in some other reports. The GUR says a Russian search and rescue operation was launched around 8:00 a.m. yesterday, involving an An-26 twin-turboprop transport, as well as Mi-8 and Ka-27 helicopters. Approximate positions of key locations in and around Crimea related to the apparent shootdown of the Su-30SM. Google Earth This led to the Russians reportedly locating 'a characteristic stain of aviation fuel in the sea,' around 45 miles northwest of Cape Tarkhankut, and also soon found the wreckage of the destroyed Su-30SM. The GUR says the aircraft in question was operated by the 43rd Independent Naval Assault Aviation Regiment of the Russian Naval Aviation. The unit’s Su-30SMs are home-based at Saki, on the Russian-occupied Crimea peninsula and they came to prominence during several encounters with NATO forces in the Black Sea in 2021. Saki has previously come under Ukrainian attack, which may have forced at least some of its aircraft to be redeployed to safer airfields. In August 2022, for example, satellite imagery revealed that at least 10 jets were seriously damaged or destroyed by Ukrainian attacks on Saki.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION The Militarnyi website says the fighter that was shot down was operating from the air base at Krymsk, in Russia’s southwestern Krasnodar Krai, directly adjacent to occupied Crimea. This base already accommodates Russian Aerospace Forces Su-30SMs, and a temporary combat deployment by Russian Navy aircraft is a possibility. According to the Oryx open-source tracking group, prior to this latest incident, the Russian military had suffered 11 Su-30SMs destroyed or damaged beyond economical repair. Since this number is based on losses that can be verified based on publicly available imagery, the actual total is very likely higher. Regardless, the loss of a Su-30SM — the most modern combat type in the Russian Naval Aviation inventory — is significant, with a value of around $50 million, according to the GUR.

Russian Ministry of Defense While it’s not entirely clear if the shootdown was the result of a carefully planned operation or was a more opportunistic engagement, it reinforces the fact that Russian military aircraft operating over the Black Sea are vulnerable to man-portable air defense systems as well as longer-range surface-to-air missiles and may also prompt a change of tactics. Otherwise, the incident reflects the ongoing battle for control of the Black Sea oil platforms, which have been fiercely fought over since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion, with the GUR being especially active. Before Russia seized the Crimea peninsula, the Black Sea shelf provided Ukraine with a large part of its natural gas. The annexation of Crimea in 2014 led to the offshore drilling platforms being occupied by Russia and they were used for military purposes after full-scale invasion, including for surveillance, communications, and air defense. By September last year, however, Ukrainian forces — spearheaded by the GUR — had regained control of several of the oil and gas platforms close to Crimea. These platforms can also be useful operational nodes for the Ukrainian military, including helping to exert control further out into the Black Sea. Russian air power has been used regularly in this campaign, with mixed results. Among its frequent targets have been Ukrainian special forces boats operating between the platforms and the mainland. On at least one occasion, Ukrainian troops apparently fought off an attack by another Su-30SM, with some reports suggesting the fighter received damage when they fired upon it.

(@narrative_hole) August 23, 2023 For Ukraine, control of the platforms is not only of military significance but also highly symbolic, bearing in mind its longer-term aim of regaining Crimea. Part of this effort has been the successful campaign to deprive the Russian Black Sea Fleet of its ability to fully control the Black Sea. With the Black Sea region still very much a key flashpoint in the conflict, Russian air activity is likely to remain a feature of the fighting. However, the loss of a Su-30SM is a reminder to Moscow that Ukraine poses a threat to its operations in the air over the Black Sea as well.

Marine Legacy F/A-18 Hornets Getting Major Firepower Boost With J...	The U.S. Marine Corps legacy F/A-18C/D Hornets are getting a major boost in stand-off strike capability in the form of AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) cruise missiles. JASSM breathes new life into the aging Marine Hornets, enabling them to hit targets on land at substantially greater ranges than they can now, keeping the jets further away from threats, and helping to maintain their relevance going forward, especially in future high-end fights. In August, personnel at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in California evaluated procedures for loading JASSMs onto Hornets as part of ongoing integration work, according to a release this week from the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing (3rd MAW). An F/A-18D from Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 232 (VMFA-232) was used for this validation and verification testing. Elements of Marine Aviation Logistics Squadron 11 (MALS-11) also participated in the test event. Personnel at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar unload an AGM-158A JASSM cruise missile during testing in August 2024 as part of work to integrate the missile onto the F/A-18C/D Hornet. USMC The Marine Corps is in the process of phasing out its F/A-18C/D Hornets, with the last of them expected to head into retirement at the end of the decade. Around 84 jets are expected to remain in service until the very end and are being heavily modernized in the meantime. Those upgrades include new APG-79(V)4 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars and improved electronic warfare suites. The Marines have at least been interested in integrating JASSM and potentially other longer-range weapons onto the aircraft for years now. You can read more about the Corps' plans for the legacy Hornets here. JASSM has substantially more reach than any strike weapon Marine Hornets can currently carry. Though the official maximum range for the baseline AGM-158A variant is classified, publicly available sources put it at between 230 and 330 miles. The extended-range AGM-158B JASSM-ER, the only version of JASSM currently in production, is understood to be able to fly roughly twice as far, at least. The AGM-48D Harpoon anti-ship cruise missiles and AGM-84H/K Standoff Land Attack Missile-Expanded Response (SLAM-ER) derivatives available for Marine Hornets now have reported ranges of around at least 80 and 170 miles, respectively. A US Marine Corps F/A-18C Hornet with a live AGM-84D Harpoon anti-ship cruise missile under its wing. USMC A US Navy legacy Hornet with a SLAM-ER missile under its right wing during testing. USN The missiles in the JASSM family are more survivable and lethal than the existing stand-off strike options for Marine legacy Hornets. This is thanks the their stealthy design and highly advanced navigation capabilities, which help them skirt hostile defenses and successfully reach their targets. The missiles' use of an imaging infrared sensor with scene/image matching capability in the terminal phase helps the weapon find and hit its mark accurately even in the face of heavy radiofrequency electronic warfare jamming. 'The integration of the AGM-158A joint air-to-surface standoff missile into the F/A-18’s arsenal significantly enhances the Hornet's capabilities, enabling it to strike targets from well beyond the reach of enemy air defenses,' Marine Maj. Bradley Kirby, an aviation ordnance officer with 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, said in a statement in the release about the testing at Miramar in August. This, in turn, opens new options for employing Marine F/A-18C/Ds in future conflicts. Giving the Hornets the ability to employ JASSM could be especially valuable in potential high-end fights, such as one against China in the Pacific, where ever-growing air and missile defense threats are expected to present significant challenges even to more modern stealthy platforms. With the Hornet's ability to operate from shorter airstrips, including ones on far-flung islands, thanks to deployable arresting gear systems, the Marines could also push JASSM-armed aircraft further forward to begin with. Integrating JASSM on the Corps' legacy Hornets also has broader implications in the near and long term. No other aircraft in the service's current fleets can currently employ JASSM, though there are plans to integrate it onto all three variants of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. It's also worth pointing out that AGM-158s are too big to fit inside the internal bays on any version of the F-35 and will have to be carried under their wings, which will increase their radar signature. The Marines are already in the process of supplanting their remaining F/A-18C/Ds, as well as AV-8B Harrier jump jets, with a mixture of F-35Bs and Cs. A rendering of an F-35 carrying a pair of AGM-158C Long-Range Anti-Ship Missiles (LRASM) under its wings. LRASM is derived from the JASSM and this is how Joint Strike Fighters would carry the latter missiles in the future, as well. Lockheed Martin 'The JASSM not only surpasses the capabilities of any other weapon currently in the Hornet’s extensive weapons portfolio, but also the Marine Corps at large,' Maj. Kirby noted following the test event at Miramar. 'This added capability will greatly increase 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing’s ability to support the joint force and enable greater freedom of maneuver across all operational domains.' 'The JASSM validation and verification process allowed Marines to contribute valuable feedback that will inform the development of checklists to be used by both the Marine Corps and the Navy against future adversaries,' Warrant Officer Josiah Hood, ordnance officer with VMFA-232, also said, highlighting how the integration of the missile on the F/A-18C/D is feed into plans to add these weapons to the F-35's arsenal. The expectation is that any future large-scale conflict will also require significant overall stand-off strike capacity. The Air Force's work on the Rapid Dragon palletized munition system to turn cargo planes into platforms to launch JASSMs is a prime example of other ways the U.S. military is looking to address that demand. Arming Marine F/A-18C/Ds with AGM-158s also adds to the total available launch platforms for those missiles. Integrating JASSMs onto legacy Hornets could open a door to adding other weapons to the available arsenal for those jets, including the Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) derivative of the AGM-158. The Marines have also talked about integrating longer-range Harpoon variants and the latest AGM-154C-1 variant of the unpowered Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) glide bomb on their F/A-18C/Ds in the past. Earlier JSOW variants are already cleared for use on legacy Hornets. The Navy halted work on a cruise missile derivative of JSOW in 2021 ostensibly to focus resources on an extended-range version of LRASM. An AGM-154 JSOW under the wing of a Finnish legacy Hornet. MKFI via Wikimedia It's also interesting to note here that the U.S. Air Force is now in the process of acquiring Joint Strike Missiles (JSM), derived from the increasingly popular Naval Strike Missile (NSM) that is in U.S. Navy and Marine Corps service, primarily as a bridge to integrating the larger LRASM onto its F-35A. LRASM is also expected to be an option in the future for the other two existing F-35 variants. JSM is less capable in many regards to JASSM and LRASM, but also significantly smaller and can fit inside the weapons bays on F-35As and Cs. JSM, which has a reported maximum range of around 350 miles, also has the ability to hit targets both on land and at sea. Plans to develop a version of LRASM with secondary land-attack capability have been axed, at least for the time being. All of this might make the JSM, which has already been fit-checked on the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet along with a host of other aircraft, an attractive additional stand-off strike option for Marine legacy Hornets.

Kongsberg Pictures showing work on integrating the Joint Strike Missile on all three variants of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, as well as the F-16. Kongsberg There has also been a surge in interest in new lower-cost cruise missiles and other types of stand-off munitions recently across the U.S. military that might feed into future Marine planning for the F/A-18C/D. Just integrating JASSM onto the Marine Corps' legacy Hornets will give the jets a major boost in capability in the twilight of their careers.

Anduril Introduces Barracuda-M That Aims To Disrupt The Cruise Mi...	Defense contractor Anduril has unveiled Barracuda, a new family of what it is calling 'expendable autonomous air vehicles' that are scalable, highly modular, and already being flight-tested. The company is heavily focused now on 'M' versions configured as relatively low-cost air-breathing precision munitions that could be launched from helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, as well as maritime and ground platforms. A Barracuda type is one of the designs the Pentagon's Defense Innovation Unit is looking at in its Enterprise Test Vehicle effort, which reflects particularly growing interest within the U.S. military in cheaper and more readily producible cruise missiles and other types of stand-off munitions. The Barracuda family as it exists now consists of three different core vehicles, the Barracuda-100, Barracuda-250, and Barracuda-500. An 'M' configuration is available for each one. Each tier of Barracuda has roughly the same general layout, with a pair of pop-out wings in the center and folding tail fins at the rear. Conformal intakes built into the bodies of the vehicles feed into their air-breath propulsion systems. Anduril says the top speed of all three existing Barracuda designs, which are powered by small turbojets, is 'up to 500 knots' depending on the mode of launch and other factors. There is a set of core subsystems that are common across all Barracuda types, but they are otherwise intended to be readily reconfigurable. The vehicles are also all designed with an eye toward using 'commercially-derived and widely-available components' to help reduce costs and enable the ramping up of production. The Barracuda-100, the smallest and shortest-ranged version, has a 35-pound payload capacity and projected maximum range of 60 and 85 nautical miles when launched from the surface and the air, respectively, according to Anduril. The company says that this version could be well suited for launch from attack helicopters like the AH-1Z Viper and AH-64 Apache, as well as from Common Launch Tube (CLT) and similar launchers mounted on the rear cargo ramps of AC-130s and other platforms, including ones on the ground. Interestingly, Anduril released an image of an example of a Barracuda-100, seen below, which shows it sporting a connector 'shoe' that is very similar to the ones found on AGM-114 Hellfire missiles and AGM-179 Joint Air-to-Ground Missiles (JAGM). For the AGM-114 and AGM-179, the connector provides an interface between the missiles and standard rail-type launchers used on AH-1s, AH-64s, and other helicopters, as well as a host of other platforms, including MQ-9 Reaper drones and AC-130J Ghostrider gunships. The Barracuda-100 is also depicted sitting in front of an AH-1 helicopter and looks to feature some kind of electro-optical, infrared, and/or laser seeker in the nose. Anduril A briefing slide showing a general breakdown of the components of the basic AGM-179A JAGM, including those components lifted directly from the AGM-114R Hellfire. The connector 'shoe' is seen on the guidance section (GS) in light green. U.S. Army The Barracuda-250 has the same payload capacity as the Barracuda-100, but with a greater expected range – up to 150 and 200 nautical miles for surface and air launch, respectively. Anduril is pitching the 250 version primarily as a potential air-launched store for tactical combat jets and bombers, including as something that could fit inside the bays of stealth fighters like the F-35. The company says it is also something that could possibly be fired from Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) vehicles on the ground or ships at sea. The Barracuda-250. Anduril Barracuda-500 has a significantly greater payload capacity of up to 100 pounds and is envisioned, at least currently, exclusively for air-launched applications with a maximum range of up to 500 miles. In addition to being employed by combat aircraft, Anduril says that this version could be suitable for use from cargo aircraft via a palletized launch method. The U.S. Air Force is currently developing a palletized launch system like this called Rapid Dragon. The Barracuda-500. Anduril The entire Barracuda-M line is intended to be usable against an array of targets on land and at sea. The company says it is still refining what guidance options it might employ to prosecute those different target sets, which will include ones that are static and moving. As already noted, Barracuda is one of four designs the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) selected to take part in its Enterprise Test Vehicle (ETV) effort. DIU is conducting ETV in cooperation with the U.S. Air Force, which sees the designs as stepping stones to a new lower-cost cruise missile. The missile offshoot of ETV is also known as 'Franklin,' reportedly a reference to the late singer Aretha Franklin and, specifically, her famous song 'Respect.' However, ETV and Franklin are just two examples of a recent explosion of interest within the U.S. military in new relatively cheap air and surface-launched stand-off munitions the production of which could also be ramped up relatively quickly. American military planners increasingly see lower-cost stand-off weapons as not only valuable, but essential for fighting and winning future wars. U.S. forces would be called upon to prosecute tens of thousands of targets in the opening stages of any high-end fight, especially one in the Pacific against China, and there would be a substantial continued need for munitions if such a conflict were to drag out. Replenishing stockpiles of expended munitions would be critical regardless in order to ensure preparedness for other contingencies. In addition, while lower-cost munitions might also be less capable, they could be used against appropriate target sets to help ensure more capable weapons are available for use in contexts that demand their employment. 'You're all familiar with the war games, where, you know, the United States and our allies run out of critical munitions in the first week or two of the conflict, and then we struggle, or theoretically would struggle, for a period of years, to replenish all the weapons that we extended,' Chris Brose, Anduril’s Chief Strategy Officer told The War Zone and other outlets. 'And I think Ukraine has put that problem in high relief for the past few years on far simpler tactical weapon systems, to say nothing of the larger critical munitions that are going to be so central for an INDOPACOM [U.S. Indo-Pacific Command] scenario.' The AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM) seen here are a prime example of the kinds of traditional cruise missiles expected to be in especially high demand in a future high-end conflict. USAF Many U.S. allies and partners are taking a similar view, underscored by lessons being drawn from the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. It emerged earlier this year, that the U.S. Air Force's Extended Range Attack Munition (ERAM) effort is focused primarily on acquiring a lower-cost stand-off aerial strike capability for the Ukrainian Air Force. The U.S. Navy has a similar focus on helping friendly foreign countries acquire new maritime stand-off strike options with what it is calling Coalition Affordable Maritime Strike (CAMS). Anduril would not name any other programs beyond ETV and Franklin in which Barracuda M versions may be involved, but acknowledged the clear and growing interest on the U.S. side, as well as among potential foreign customers, in munitions of this kind. 'There are other places where Barracuda is making progress' and 'we're seeing a lot of interest from allies and partners,' according to Brose. Barracudas could also be configured in other ways besides munitions. As The War Zone has noted in the past, there is already an increasingly blurry line between cruise missiles, decoys with electronic warfare payloads, and longer-range kamikaze drones. 'People… were thinking about how we do a better job of applying digital engineering and said you know, ‘if we built a software programmable, modular, but recoverable air vehicle that looks a lot like a missile and flies over most of the missile envelope that could greatly accelerate how we do test[ing],' Tim Grayson, Special Assistant to Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall, said during a talk the Air & Space Force Asscoation's Mitchell Institute hosted in July. 'And it was sort of like chocolate and peanut butter coming together. …this modular thing for testing purposes, it’s very adaptable, one of the modules is a warhead, sure looks like a low-cost cruise missile.' Grayson said at the time the Air Force was referring to the concept he described as the Affordable Mass Munition, which is very much in line with the thinking underpinning both DIU's ETV effort and Anduril's Barracuda. Anduril has itself highlighted the potential for Barracudas to work collaboratively in groups using the company's propriety Lattice artificial intelligence-enabled autonomy software package, third-party systems, or a mixture of both. 'Undergirding all of what exists inside of Barracuda is the Lattice operating system and the high levels of mission autonomy that that brings. So when we talk about barracuda, and this is kind of inherent in the name, right? It is, it is a capability that is designed to be deployed in groups, you know, to hunt and effect in teams,' Brose explained. 'You can, obviously, you know, deliver those effects through a single air vehicle, but the real value of the capability, which is realized both in the high levels of autonomy and the low levels of cost, is the ability to actually deploy these as teams, to go out and do collaborative engagement.' 'There was the question about survivability, countermeasures, and I think&#8230; we're trying to think about this problem differently,' he continued. 'You don't necessarily have to bundle every single piece of capability into a single round or air vehicle. You can also envision how working as a team, multiple air vehicles are capable of collaborating, providing different capabilities, whether it's target detection, whether it's decoying or countermeasures, whether it's strike, so that that package can go deliver the mission effect that you want, without, again, having to bundle all of that into one air vehicle and then radically, drive up the cost per round of every single vehicle.' What Brose is describing here is an inherent capability offered by fully networked swarms of systems acting as a unified whole. Networked munitions that can work together collaboratively is something the U.S. military has a stated interest in with the U.S. Air Force's Golden Horde project being a prime example. The entire Barracuda family and the core design of the vehicles highlight Anduril's broader vision for disrupting typical development, production, and supply chains, as well as exportability, when it comes to defense programs. The animated promotional video for Barracuda, seen at the top of this story, underscores the company's consistent push to set itself apart from traditional defense contractors. Founded in 2017, it is still a relative newcomer in the industry, but has been steadily securing more major contracts from the U.S. military and foreign armed forces. It is also been working to significantly grow its own organic production capacity, including a planned 'hyperscale' factory in the United States announced earlier this year. A rendering of Anduril's planned 'hyperscale' factory. Anduril What Anduril is looking to do with Barracuda 'is the opposite of what you see in our traditional weapons sector, which are exquisite systems that are incredibly hard to produce, that are limited in their scalability across those programs by highly specialized labor, overly defense-specific supply chains, very complex, bespoke, manual defense-unique manufacturing processes, exquisite materials and the like, such that these systems become incredibly difficult and all but impossible to really produce in the volumes that our operational leaders are saying they're going to need, which is like a 10x increase in weapons production,' Anduril Brose explained. 'These are systems that can be assembled with tools, literally, that you probably have in your garage – screwdrivers, pliers, things of that sort. So it is not gated in terms of its producibility on highly specialized tooling, highly specialized manufacturing processes, highly specialized labor, none of which we're ever going to have enough of.' A key aspect of the underlying approach is 'I have to leverage commercial supply chains as much as possible. I have to make the weapon as simple to produce and as simple to assemble as possible, so that the broadest possible labor tool can be brought to bear, to scale production,' he continued. 'So the ability to tap into commercial automotive&#8230; labor pools and related sources of workforce, is how we're thinking about this system, not just so you can build it in large numbers at low prices to begin with, but if, God forbid, we find ourselves in another protracted conflict where we have to keep that rate manufacturing high over a prolonged period of time, we're capable of doing that.' In addition, 'you can take it apart like Lego blocks, and it makes it a lot easier to kind of work through and navigate, you know, kind of defense export issues and collaboration with allies,' Brose added. 'A lot of that is keeping it simple. Don't reduce the number of parts that you need to use. Rely more on commercial components. Reduce the tooling and the complexity of manufacturing. This makes it much more producible, and allows us to kind of rely on infrastructure and manufacturing capabilities and labor forces that isn't, again, bespoke to just one single system,' Diem Salmon, Vice President of Air Dominance and Strike at Anduril, also told The War Zone and other outlets while speaking alongside Brose. 'This also significantly brings the cost down. So less touch labor, etc, if you're down to, you know, a handful of common tools, rather than having unique tool sets for every single variant of weapon that you're developing.' Whether Anduril will be able to make good on its broader vision, through Barracuda or any of the rest of its steadily growing portfolio, remains to be seen. The company has somewhat nebulously said 'a single Barracuda takes 50 percent less time to produce, requires 95 percent fewer tools, and 50 percent fewer parts than competing solutions on the market today' and that 'the Barracuda family &#8230; is 30 percent cheaper on average than other solutions, enabling affordable mass and cost-effective, large-scale employment,' but has so far not provided a direct 1:1 comparison with an existing system. A statement like '30 percent cheaper on average' presents a very broad potential cost range when talking about a multi-tier family of readily reconfigurable systems. Existing in the same general classes can have different price points, as well. For instance, the unit cost of a current-generation AGM-114 Hellfires is around $210,000 to $215,000, while that of a newer AGM-179A JAGM is in the $300,000 to $330,000 range, according to U.S. Army budget documents. A munition in either of those price ranges is much cheaper than something like an AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM) with a unit cost of more than a million dollars. At the same time, U.S. military officials have been increasingly public about their view that there is a need for expansion in the U.S. defense industrial base and that smaller or otherwise non-traditional companies will play important roles in doing that going forward. ETV, specifically, presents a path 'to expand our industrial base into non-traditional suppliers that perhaps have not historically been large-scale munitions producers,' Vice Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force Gen. James Slife said back in July. 'If the manufacturing techniques we’re able to leverage pan out we’ll be able to take advantage of a bigger part of the American industrial base to produce munitions for us.' With this in mind, Anduril faces already stiff and still growing competition when it comes to products like Barracuda. In August, Y Combinator, a powerful Silicon Valley technology incubator, announced it was backing a startup aiming to produce lower-cost cruise missiles in its first-ever foray into the defense sector. If nothing else, the public debut of the Barracuda family is the latest evidence of bigger trends in the U.S. defense industry that could have ramifications well beyond work on new and cheaper precision munitions.
