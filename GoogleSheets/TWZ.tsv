Boeing’s Little Bird Helicopter Production Set To End	Boeing expects to shutter its production of the Little Bird light helicopter after fulfilling a current contract with the Thai armed forces. The Little Bird is well known for its continued service with the U.S. Army's famed 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR), which operates the helicopter in AH-6 light attack and MH-6 assault configurations. Boeing has been able to secure just two export sales of its 'international' AH-6i variant to Saudi Arabia and Thailand in the past 15 years. A separate company, MD Helicopters also produces Little Bird variants and looks set to continue to do so. Multiple outlets have reported Boeing's plans to close out its Little Bird production line. The company disclosed the news at the DefenceIQ International Military Helicopter conference in London, which opened yesterday. An AH-6i destined for Thailand seen during flight testing. Boeing 'We are probably going to cease production on the AH-6i,' Mark Bellew, Boeing’s Director for Vertical-Lift Program Business Development and Strategy, told Aviation Week. 'We will complete production for Thailand, but right now, unless there is another country that came along immediately and said we want AH-6 today, it would still be a challenge as there would be a gap in production.' Bellew also 'suggested that rebuilding the supply chain for the aircraft would not only take time, but also make the aircraft more expensive to produce,' according to Aviation Week's report. TWZ has reached out to Boeing directly for more information. Boeing is currently working on delivering eight AH-6is to the Royal Thai Army under a contract finalized back in 2022 valued a just under $104 million. The U.S. government had approved that sale in 2019. The single turbine engine AH-6i is an evolution of the OH-6 Cayuse, originally developed by Hughes Helicopters in the 1960s and made famous by its service with the U.S. Army as a light scout helicopter during the Vietnam War, and subsequent H-6 variants based around the improved Model 500 design. McDonnell Douglas acquired Hughes Helicopters in 1984. Boeing subsequently absorbed McDonnell Douglas, to include the Little Bird and the rest of the former Hughes Helicopter product line, in 1997. A prototype YOH-6A seen during US Army testing in the 1960s. US Army The Little Bird's story has become somewhat confusing in that Boeing sold off virtually all of its inherited Hughes Helicopter product line, with the prominent exception of the AH-64 Apache, in 1999 to what has become MD Helicopters. However, Boeing continued to work with the Little Bird design after that, including upgraded Mission Enhanced Little Birds (MELB) for the 160th SOAR. One of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment's MH-6 Little Birds seen during a public demonstration in 2024. Jamie Hunter The company also developed an uncrewed H-6U version and an improved light attack variant dubbed the AH-6S. The AH-6S was pitched to the U.S. Army for its abortive Armed Aerial Scout (AAS) program. The export AH-6i is based on the AH-6S. As already noted, Boeing has found just two customers for the AH-6i, Thailand and Saudi Arabia, the latter of which ordered 24 examples for the Saudi Arabian National Guard (SANG) in 2014. Jordan signed a letter of intent to buy at least 18 AH-6is in 2010, but an expected contract never materialized. By comparison, MD Helicopters has enjoyed significant success in the international military market with Hughes Model 500-derived Little Birds, as well as sales of related commercial variants. This includes dozens of MD-530FU light attack variants delivered to the now-defunct Afghan Air Force, some of which made their way back to the United States after the Taliban takeover in August 2021. What level of involvement Boeing expects to continue to have in supporting the 160th SOAR's Little Bird fleet going forward is unclear. The Army had previously expected to replace around half of its AH-6/MH-6s with a special operations version of the design selected for the service's Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) program. However, FARA was canceled last year and the 160th is now looking, at least in the near term, at options for further upgrades to its Little Bird fleet, as you can read more about here. For Boeing, plans to shed the Little Bird production line also come amid significant turmoil across its military and commercial portfolios. This has translated to major delays on very-high-profile programs, including new Air Force One jets for the U.S. Air Force, and billions in financial losses. In 2023, the company had also announced its intention to shutter production of the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighter and refocus those resources elsewhere, again citing a lack of new customers. Unless a major new customer for the AH-6i emerges soon, Boeing's part of the Little Bird story looks set to come to end, though versions of the iconic helicopter will remain in production through MD Helicopters.

Ground-Launched And Powered Air-Launched Versions Of StormBreaker...	Raytheon has revealed that it’s working on a ground-launched version of its StormBreaker glide bomb, previously available only in air-launched form. The new development of the weapon should provide a very versatile follow-on to the Ground-Launched Small Diameter Bomb (GLSDB), which made its combat debut in Ukraine but had reportedly performed poorly there, especially due to heavy Russian jamming. Meanwhile, the same motor that will be used on the ground-launched model is also planned to be added to the air-launched version, providing a considerably greater standoff range. The existence of the ground-launched StormBreaker — the official name of the weapon was not revealed — was disclosed by Jon 'Stormin' Norman, the Vice President Air & Space Defense Systems Requirements & Capability at Raytheon. He was speaking on the Fighter Pilot Podcast, the full episode of which you can find here. A GBU-53/B StormBreaker loaded onto an F-15E Strike Eagle during a test. Raytheon 'On company funding, we’re working with some of the service labs to do a ground launch variant of [StormBreaker],' Norman said. 'We’ll be testing that to summer on company money, and that’ll give it a good range and a good point-defense capability.' Norman added that the company was still looking at propulsion options for the ground-launched version, with either a rocket motor or an air-breathing engine under consideration. However, whatever option is chosen will likely also make its way onto the air-launched version, too. 'We’re working on the engineering design to integrate that onto the weapon to greatly enhance the range of that StormBreaker so we can keep our pilots outside of threat rings. So we’re very excited about that. We think that this has a lot of growth capability.' An F-15E drops a StormBreaker during a test. Raytheon Before looking at the particular advantages offered by a ground-launched StormBreaker, it’s worth looking briefly at the development path that brought Raytheon here. The story starts with the 250-pound GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bomb or SDB I, a ‘fire and forget’ precision attack weapon that combines standoff with small size. This means more examples of the weapon can be carried by a single aircraft. Depending on the launch height and speed, the unpowered SDB I can reach targets as far as 60 miles away, thanks to its pop-out wing set. However, this is under optimal conditions, and a range in the region of 45-50 miles is more likely when launched from a tactical jet.

Lewis An A-10 carrying a load of 16 GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs (SDB) during testing. U.S. Air Force / William R. Lewis However, the original SDB I is not able to engage moving targets, a limitation addressed by the Small Diameter Bomb II, now better known as the GBU-53/B StormBreaker. This is able to hit moving targets in any weather, thanks to its tri-mode guidance system, which uses imaging infrared, millimeter-wave radar, or semi-active laser homing to hit a designated aimpoint. There is also a datalink, allowing the munition to communicate over the Link 16 network, so pilots can send updated target information to the StormBreaker after the weapon has left its launch pylon. While it only weighs 204 pounds, this includes a surprisingly powerful penetrating warhead for its size. The tri-mode seeker for the StormBreaker. Raytheon Depending on the altitude and speed of the launching aircraft, the weapon can glide up to 69 miles on its own using a GPS-assisted inertial navigation system, after which it can strike a specific coordinate or begin searching for a target. For moving targets, the weapon’s range is reduced to 45 miles.

James Deboer A Marine F-35B sitting on a stretch of highway in California during a recent exercise. James Deboer The air-launched StormBreaker is therefore well suited to tasks as battlefield interdiction and destruction of enemy air defenses against ground-mobile targets and even anti-ship attacks. It’s also much more flexible when it comes to targeting and re-targeting overall. The first effort to transform the series into a surface-launched long-range precision strike weapon was the Ground-Launched Small Diameter Bomb, or GLSDB, developed by Boeing, in partnership with Saab of Sweden, on the basis of the air-launched SDB. Each GLSDB is comprised of two existing components, the air-launched GBU-39/B SDB and the rocket motor from the 227mm-caliber M26 artillery rocket. The M26 is among the rocket types that can be fired from the M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS), and variants thereof, and the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS). A rendering shows the launch of a GLSDB. Saab The GLSDB is propelled by its M26 rocket motor before the pop-out wings deploy for the final unpowered run-in to the target. Saab The GLSDB relies on the M26 rocket motor to propel it for the initial boost/loft phase, after which the wings are deployed and the munition flies unpowered, as a glide bomb. It uses the GBU-39/B’s existing inertial navigation system and embedded GPS to guide it to its target. The GLSDB has a range of around 94 miles. In its marketing literature, Saab claimed that the GLSDB’s guidance system not only ensures accuracy to within three feet but is also resilient to electronic warfare jamming, something that is of particular concern in the Ukrainian conflict. However, once exposed to combat for the first time by Ukrainian forces, it seems the GLSDB was found wanting. 'One company, I won’t say who they are, they came up with a really cool idea of taking an air-to-ground weapon and doing a ground-launched version of it, and it would be a long-range fire weapon,' Bill LaPlante, Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, said in April 2024. Although he didn’t mention the GLSDB by name, his meaning was clear, as no other weapons fit this description. 'They raced and did it as fast as they could,' LaPlante continued. He added that U.S. authorities relaxed their testing requirements to help speed the weapon system in question to Ukraine. 'We said, look, just test for safety. Otherwise, the operational testing will be non-cooperative with the Russians,' according to LaPlante. 'And so then we sent it to Ukrainians. It didn’t work.' A scale model of a GLSDB. Joseph Trevithick A scale model of a complete GLSDB round. Joseph Trevithick LaPlante claimed the GLSDB’s performance was limited for 'multiple reasons,' including the dense electronic warfare environment, as well as the tactics, techniques, and procedures. 'It just didn’t work,' LaPlante explained, before suggesting that the weapon had been more or less abandoned by the Ukrainians as a result. While LaPlante didn’t provide any more details on the electronic warfare issue, it’s by now no secret that Russian GPS jamming, in particular, has reduced the efficiency of Ukraine’s use of Western precision-guided ground and air-launched munitions. As the war in Ukraine has continued, Russian forces have significantly expanded their use of various kinds of electronic warfare capabilities. Clearly, weapons like GLSDB that rely on GPS are going to be especially vulnerable to Russian jamming of this kind. The StormBreaker, however, should be much more resilient, thanks to its tri-mode guidance. Although Norman made no mention of the GLSDB’s performance or of its utilization in Ukraine, having a weapon that is better able to cope with Russian or any other hostile electronic warfare makes a good deal of sense. A tri-mode seeker means that, unlike the GLSDB, the ground-launched StormBreaker will have the ability to find its way to a moving or static target and to cope with smoke, dust, and other poor weather conditions. Furthermore, the weapon’s onboard computer is able to classify and prioritize targets on its own, seeking out their especially vulnerable points, too. Additionally, the StormBreaker features hardening against electromagnetic jamming and cyber attacks, providing a further level of reliability. Aside from the propulsion choices, Norman didn’t provide details of how the ground-launched StormBreaker might work in comparison to the GLSDB. It’s unclear if the rocket motor he referred to would be the same as that used in the GLSDB, although the possibility of an air-breathing engine would tally with Raytheon’s goal of developing a weapon that will have a maximum range considerably greater than the roughly 94 miles of the GLSDB. This would be especially relevant for the air-launched version, in which the speed and altitude of the launch platform would combine with the motor to provide even greater standoff distance. The war in Ukraine has also reinforced the importance of having munitions that put considerably more distance between the launch platform and the target area. Even the GLSDB, for all its apparent problems, provides significantly greater reach than the longest-range 227mm artillery rockets currently available for the M270 MLRS and the M142 HIMARS. These can fire precision-guided rockets out to around 50 miles. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian Air Force has had notable success with the air-launched SDB. A weapon that combines the versatility of the air-launched StormBreaker with even greater standoff range would be of huge interest to any number of air forces. Clearly, depending on the eventual maximum range, a single ground-launched StormBreaker battery will be able to provide prompt precision strike option even against moving targets over a large geographical area. Just assuming the same range as the current GLSDB, it would be able to address targets over nearly 28,000 square miles. As such, it will offer even small forward-based unit unprecedented capabilities. This could including striking numerous vehicles dozens of miles away with exacting precision, in any weather, without the use of air support — whether it be manned or unmanned aircraft. This capability would offer drastic efficiencies and a new level of organic precision fire support basically anywhere on the battlefield a launcher can survive. When it comes to the powered air-launched SDB II, that would also offer a huge leap in capability, allowing aircraft to make greater use of ever more capable and farther-reaching kill webs that leverage advanced networking for targeting. Its extended range would also provide a larger margin of survivability for the launch platform, which face increasingly long-ranged air defenses. TWZ has approached Raytheon for more details about the ground-launched version of the StormBreaker — and the powered air-launched model. With tests of the ground-launched version apparently now underway, we should learn more about the new weapon in due course. While it’s hard to determine the full scope of its capabilities at this early stage, the ground-launched StormBreaker would appear to offer a range of advantages over the GLSDB, not least its ability to hit moving targets in all weathers — and its better resilience to electronic warfare jamming.

Axing Next Generation Fighter Would Leave Air Force Worse Off: Fo...	The U.S. Air Force's force design director says analyses to date show the service will face more operational risk and be less able to achieve assigned objectives without a new crewed sixth-generation combat jet. Air Force wargaming has shown a need to keep persistent pressure on the enemy in forward areas and that a force structure centered solely on long-range, stand-off capabilities does not win major fights. The service has yet to make a final decision on how to proceed, or not, with work on a new crewed sixth-generation combat jet as part of its Next Generation Air Domaince (NGAD) initiative, which will have broader ramifications for the entire force. Air Force Maj. Gen. Joseph Kunkel discussed the NGAD combat jet and related matters during a talk the Hudson Institute think tank in Washington, D.C., hosted earlier today. Kunkel is currently the Director of Force Design, Integration, and Wargaming within the office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Air Force Futures at the service's top headquarters at the Pentagon. A Lockheed Martin rendering of a crewed 6th generation stealth combat jet concept. Lockheed Martin 'So, the fight looks fundamentally different with [the] NGAD [combat jet] and without NGAD,' Kunkel said. 'I won't go into the details on how the fight looks different, but the fight looks much better when NGAD's in it.' 'So, I think at the end of the day, what we'll find is, you know, we'll make a decision on how the Joint Force wants to fight. If the Joint Force wants to fight with an NGAD, and [to gain] air superiority in these really, really tough places to achieve it, then we'll pursue NGAD and it'll be, frankly, it'll be less operational risk. The NGAD provides dominant capabilities,' he continued. 'If we choose not to, as a nation, to pursue NGAD, then that fight's just going to look a little bit different, all right, and we may not be able to pursue or achieve all of our policy objectives.' Details about competing NGAD combat jet designs that have been under development for years now are limited. The core requirements are understood to call relatively large, high-performance, and long-range design with a very high level of broadband low-observability (stealthiness) and an array of advanced sensors, networking, and other capabilities. The jets have also been expected to have a high unit price of around $300 million or more. Former Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall said in January that it would take approximately $20 billion, at least, just to complete the development of the aircraft. Series production of the aircraft would result in the complete cost of the program being much larger. Kendall had initiated a deep review of the NGAD combat jet plans last year. The Air Force considered several alternatives as part of that process, including a lower-cost design with more truncated capabilities and more focused on just acting as an aerial controller for Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones. The reassessment of NGAD also tied in with larger future force structure discussions, including about a possible shift in focus to longer-range, stand-off capabilities, such as those that the forthcoming B-21 Raider stealth bomber will provide. A rendering of a notional sixth-generation combat jet flying together with a trio of drones. Collins Aerospace 'There were some folks that were like, what if we just become an all-long-range force? And so we're like, okay, let's try it, let's see what [an] all-long-range force looks like,' Maj. Gen. Kunkel said at the Hudson Institute today. 'And turns out, an all-long-range force loses because what it can't do is it can't apply constant pressure to the adversary.' 'You've got to be forward in order to sustain the tempo that's required to bring the adversary to a sneeze. So an all-long-range force, &#8230; it sounds wonderful, doesn't it? You sit in Topeka, Kansas, you press a red button, the war gets fought. Nobody gets hurt. It's all done at long range,' Kunkel continued. '[But] it doesn't win because it just can't sustain the tempo of the fight.' 'Long-range fires are extremely important. They're absolutely game-changing. They're going to help us out,' he added. 'But they're probably not going to do it at the tempo that's required to keep the adversary, you know, on its knees all the time. You need something else. You need something inside. You need something inside that can generate tempo and mass.' Kunkel acknowledged that this need to be able to persist closer to the epicenter for a future fight raises its own challenges and questions, especially amid ever-growing air and surface-launched missile threats. The Air Force published a report detailing a vision for the service by 2050 last year, which underlined these issues, particularly in highlighting the expectation that anti-air missiles with a range of 1,000 miles will be part of that future threat ecosystem. For years now, the Air Force has already become increasingly concerned about the survivability of key supporting assets, especially aerial refueling tankers, even in what have been traditionally considered safer rear areas. A rendering of a notional sixth-generation combat jet refueling in flight. Lockheed Martin 'We are more focused on survivable air refueling,' Kunkel said. 'We're approaching this from the kill chain perspective.' He further elaborated that what this means is that the Air Force is looking a multiple tiers of what he referred to as 'attack surfaces' in the aerial refueling space that a potential adversary would have to address, which, in turn, would complicate their their kill chain planning cycles. The service has been looking to acquire new stealthy tankers as part of a larger Next-Generation Aerial Refueling System (NGAS) initiative, but has also been exploring other options like podded aerial refueling capabilities for fighter-sized aircraft. 'There are many attack surfaces that we can attack to bring survivable air refueling, right?' Kunkel noted. 'NGAS might be part of the solution, but there are other places along this kill chain that we can attack the adversary, and that's the approach we're taking.' A notional stealthy tanker depicted refueling a pair of F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. Lockheed Martin Skunk Works The Air Force is also looking at future air operations, especially in the context of a potential high-end fight in the Pacific against China, with the expectation of being under constant attack, or at least the threat thereof. This creates additional demands for forces trying to conduct higher-tempo operations in forward areas. 'The Air Force of the future is not going to be one that's operating from sanctuary, right? We are going to be contested everywhere, and frankly, we're contested everywhere right now,' Kunkel said. 'So this thought that we have to operate under the threat of attack is something that's going to be with us forever.' Kunkel emphasized the Air Force's current focus in this regard on more distributed and disaggregated concepts of operations, presently referred to collectively as Agile Combat Operations (ACE), that are designed to make friendly forces harder to target. Expanding the total number of operating locations available to Air Force units is a key element of ACE, as underscored by the massive effort in the past year or so to refurbish historic North Field on the U.S. island of Tinian in the western Pacific, which you can read more about here.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION New and improved supporting capabilities, all the way down to the most basic levels, as well as survivable supply chains, will also be needed to ensure that Air Force aircraft can operate effectively even from more far-flung locales, according to Kunkel. The requirements for sustaining historically maintenance-intentive stealthy aircraft, including skins and coatings that are highly sensitive to environmental factors, is a particular issue that needs to be addressed. 'When you think about the sustainment architectures that we built in the past, the thought was that they were going to be in sanctuary. So, you know, you could afford to build a piece of aircraft ground equipment that weighed 10,000 pounds and wouldn't fit on a C-130,' Kunkel explained. 'You can afford to have low-observable [steathly] restoration timelines on your aircraft that lasted multiple days and required climate-controlled facilities. Robotic systems apply a corrosion-resistant coating to a U.S. Air Force F-35A Joint Strike Fighter. USAF 'In a new environment where that whole thing is going to be under threat, we've got to think about it differently,' he continued. 'So we have been leveraging new technologies &#8230; in the field of low-observable maintenance, we made a significant amount of progress.' 'And I will tell you, some of it's not like the sexy, cool stuff. It's like the basics. It's like bomb loaders, missile loaders, and, you know, refueling trucks and, you know, electric carts and air conditioning carts. They've got to be made differently,' he added. Kunkel did appear to push back on calls for more physical hardening of facilities against enemy attacks, something that has become a heated topic of debate. The Hudson Institute think tank itself just published a report in January warning that U.S. airbases in the Pacific have been left worryingly vulnerable by a lack of investment in hardened and unhardened aircraft shelters. An F-16 Viper fighter sits inside a hardened aircraft shelter. USAF 'There's this thought that we need to invest in more defense. &#8230; And my counter that is no, we actually need to invest in more offense,' Kunkel said without explicitly mentioning physical hardening. 'We need to invest in more offense, and we need to make sure that those offensive capabilities inherently have survivability built into them.' As other Air Force officials have done in the past, Kunkel did advocate for more active air and missile defenses. A huge new air defense architecture taking shape on the critically strategic U.S. island of Guam in the western Pacific is a prime example of work already being done toward this end. Kunkel is also the latest Air Force official to raise the possibility of the service taking a more direct role in the air and missile defense realm. Since 1948, the U.S. Army has been the lead service in charge of defending Air Force bases at home and abroad against air and missile threats. There is the additional question now about whether budget priorities under President Donald Trump's new administration might upend various Air Force modernization plans, as well as ones across the rest of the U.S. military. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has directed a review of proposed Fiscal Year 2026 spending plans with an eye toward shifting roughly eight percent, or some $50 billion, of the Department of Defense's entire budget to new priorities, including a hugely expanded homeland missile defense architecture now dubbed Golden Dome. Air Force officials have already raised concerns about the affordability of the NGAD combat jet, as well as stealthy tankers and CCA drones, given the demands of even higher-priority programs. The ballooning costs of the Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) effort have been a key factor. There is also talk about increasing the size of the future B-21 bomber fleet. Secretary of Defense Hegseth has also ordered the Air Force to put a broad swath of modernization work on pause until a new Air Force Secretary is confirmed and can review the plans. The first pre-production B-21 Raider. USAF Speaking today, Kunkel was bullish on the Air Force's future budget prospects, but acknowledged that cuts to existing programs could have significant impacts. 'The role of the Air Force is increasing. It's not decreasing. It's increasing,' he said. 'For this future fight, we're going to be a big part of that. So no easy solutions in that space.' 'Our investments and our force design is [sic] completely in line with where the administration is going,' he added. 'When you look at the Secretary's priorities, and you look at our force design, there's a match.' Though questions remain about exactly what shape it take, the Air Force is clearly still pushing for the NGAD combat jet to be part of that future force structure.

This Is What The Classified AIM-260 Missile Actually Looks Like, ...	The U.S. Air Force has confirmed that a recently released rendering of the AIM-260A does indeed reflect the actual design of what is also known as the Joint Advanced Tactical Missile (JATM). The JATM, details about which are still highly classified, is expected to ultimately supplant the AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) in U.S. military service. The new AIM-260A rendering was included in an unclassified U.S. Navy industry day briefing that the service posted online earlier this month. The complete briefing provides an overview of projects that fall under the broad umbrella of Naval Air Systems Command's (NAVAIR) Program Executive Office for Unmanned Aviation & Strike Weapons (PEO U&W). JATM is more specifically within the purview of PEO U&W's Air-to-Air Missile Office, or PMA-259. The AIM-174B air-launched version of the Standard Missile-6 (SM-6), which was only formally unveiled last year, as well as the AIM-120, AIM-9 Sidewinder, and AIM-7/RIM-7 Sparrow missiles, are also in PMA-259's portfolio. The full slide from the PEO U&#038;W briefing that includes the AIM-260A rendering. USN As its name makes clear, JATM is also a joint program that the Air Force is directly involved in. When asked for more information about the AIM-260A rendering and for a more general update on the missile's development, NAVAIR redirected TWZ to the Air Force. 'This is a rendering of the AIM-260A,' an Air Force spokesperson subsequently told TWZ. 'A higher-resolution rendering is not available for public release.' 'Specific programmatic and technical details of the program are classified,' they added. 'JATM milestones and capabilities are classified.' In 2022, now-retired Air Force Gen. Mark Kelly, then head of Air Combat Command (ACC), also shared artwork of upgraded F-22 Raptors with new stealthy sensor pods and drop tanks seen below. One of the jets was depicted firing a then-unknown missile now definitively established to be a JATM. At least one other official AIM-260A rendering has emerged previously, which also aligns with the design seen in the PEO U&W briefing. Via USAF Gen. Mark Kelly This one has been around for a bit, from a Hook presentation a couple years ago. pic.twitter.com/CQx0qKnTuq&mdash; Brian Everstine (@beverstine) February 24, 2025 All three AIM-260A renders show the same core missile design optimized for high speed and low drag with just four fins at the tail end. For comparison, the existing AIM-120 has four tail fins and another four along the middle of its body. There are some minor detail differences between the AIM-260A renders that are now available, including the number and location of what appear to be conformal antennas along the front end of the missile's body. The latest depiction of the JATM from the PEO U&W briefing also has markings that point to a rocket motor that is substantially longer than the one found on the AMRAAM. Per U.S. military-standard munition markings, brown bands denote the presence of low-order explosives like solid-fuel rockets. On missiles, a pair of brown bands typically reflects where the rocket motor starts and ends within the body. Yellow bands mark the location of high-explosives used in warheads. Training missiles with inert rocket motors and/or warheads have blue bands instead. A side-by-side comparison of the AIM-260A render, at top, and a live AIM-120 missile, below. The distance between the brown bands on the AIM-260A represents a notably larger proportion of the missile's overall length compared to what is seen on the AIM-120. USN/USAF An advanced rocket motor with highly loaded propellant has long been seen as a likely route to give the AIM-260A significantly greater range, as well as speed, over the AIM-120 without making the new missile larger. A core known requirement for the JATM is that it has to have the same general form factor as the AMRAAM, in large part to ensure that it can fit inside the internal bays on stealth fighters like the F-22 and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. In addition to crewed aircraft, AIM-260As are expected to arm future stealthy drones like the ones under development under the Air Force's Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) program. 'The Next-Generation Highly Loaded Grain project team has matured the technology and seeded the development of future mission-modular propulsion systems that can increase weapon ranges by up to 1.5x while maintaining inner boundaries for short-range and time-critical missions,' according to a factsheet detailing notable achievements by NAVAIR's Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCAD) in 2023. PMA-259 has been similarly looking at highly loaded grain rocket motors as part of work toward a possible improved Block III version of the AIM-9X Sidewinder in recent years, as TWZ has explored in detail in the past. As part of the annual defense policy bill for the 2025 Fiscal Year, or National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which was passed and signed into law last year, Congress has demanded the Air Force and the Navy look into whether extended-range variants or derivatives of the AIM-9X and the AIM-120 could also help meet future air-to-air missile needs.

Thrust vectoring capability would also be a requisite to give the missile sufficient agility in the absence of additional control surfaces. If the renders of the AIM-260A prove fully accurate, the missile will also have a high-explosive warhead rather than be a hit-to-kill design intended to destroy its target through sheer force of impact. At the same time, if the AIM-260A's rocket motor is longer than that of the AIM-120, but the two missiles are roughly similar in size, this will reduce the space inside JATM for other components. This, in turn, could point to a smaller, but more advanced warhead designed to produce suitable destructive effects with less mass. A broadly similar rearrangement of internal space has also been observed on the AGM-88G Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile-Extended Range (AARGM-ER) compared to the preceding AGM-88E AARGM. A previously released briefing slide showing the internal configuration of the AGM-88G AARGM-ER and the considerable space inside devoted to its solid rocket motor. USN Details about the AIM-260A's capabilities otherwise remain limited. An active electronically scanned array radar (AESA) seeker is likely. Multi-mode seeker capability, potentially with imaging infrared and passive radiofrequency (RF) guidance capabilities, could be extremely valuable in the face of an ever-expanding countermeasure ecosystem, although we have no idea if this is a feature now or not. It's also possible it could be introduced in later variants. Advanced networking capabilities would be a key feature, allowing the missile to get additional targeting information from an array of third party sources. This is especially imported for engaging targets beyond the reach of the launch platform's own sensors and it can allow the aircraft firing the missile, especially a stealthy one, to avoid having to switch on its radar and increase its vulnerability to detection as a result. Multiple networked JATMs might even be able to prosecute engagements cooperatively. As TWZ has written in the past: 'The U.S. military has said explicitly in the past that concerns about increasingly longer-range Chinese air-to-air missiles have been a key driver behind work on the AIM-260. Even an extra 50 miles would give JATM a huge boost in capability over the AIM-120D. Better end-game energy state and multi-mode seeker would further boost its comparative abilities. As such, it would sit atop the AIM-120 as a long-range air-to-air weapon, with some significant overlap. Networking capabilities on all these weapons also give them the ability to leverage third-party targeting and all the guileful tactics that come with that feature set.' It's also it's unclear when the first JATMs might enter the U.S. military arsenal. When the program first emerged publicly in 2019, the goal was to begin fielding the missiles in 2022. However, there have been no indications publicly that this has occurred despite active testing of the missile, including live-fire shots, and other work to support its entry into service. No imagery of a real AIM-260A has emerged to date. What we do know for sure now is that the rendering in the recently released Navy briefing, as well as ones that have merged in the past, do show the AIM-260A JATM design.

South Korea’s Loyal Wingman Air Combat Drone Unveiled	South Korea today unveiled a new stealthy loyal wingman-type drone, the Low Observable Unmanned Wingman System, or LOWUS, which it plans to operate alongside the locally developed KF-21 Boramae next-generation fighter. The new drone is part of a growing fleet of low-observable drones being developed in South Korea as the country seeks to introduce new uncrewed technologies for a range of missions. The first prototype of the LOWUS was rolled out today at Korean Air’s Busan Tech Center in the southeast of the country. The drone was developed by Korean Air together with the Agency for Defense Development (ADD), a government body responsible for research and development in defense technology, funded by the Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA). Check out LOWUS design in the video below: The Agency for Defense Development (ADD) and Korean Air held a rollout ceremony on the 25th at the Korean Air Tech Center in Busan for the first prototype of the 'Low Observable Unmanned Wingman System (LOWUS),' a core platform of the manned-unmanned teaming system.The unmanned… pic.twitter.com/Y574HvlCW0&mdash; kf21_military (@fa50_defense) February 25, 2025 The LOWUS program was launched in 2021, with the research and development phase. A first flight of the first prototype is reportedly planned for the end of this year, leading toward the first manned-unmanned teaming flight tests by 2027. These will involve a piloted aircraft directly controlling the drone in flight. The new drone is being developed from the outset for manned-unmanned teaming, in which it will operate with a significant degree of autonomously alongside crewed combat aircraft. It is expected to undertake missions including reconnaissance, electronic warfare, and strike, in support of crewed fighters, including the KF-21. South Korea’s locally developed KF-21 Boramae next-generation fighter during its first air-to-air refueling trials. DAPA DAPA screencap In terms of its design, the LOWUS has stealth features, including a reduced radar cross-section and a construction that makes use of radar-absorbent material (RAM). Superficially, the drone looks very similar to the XQ-58A Valkyrie, the stealthy, affordable uncrewed aircraft that has been developed by U.S. drone-maker Kratos. The LOWUS also has some visual similarities with the Airpower Teaming System loyal wingman drone, now known as the MQ-28 Ghost Bat, which was developed by Boeing’s Australian subsidiary, initially for the Royal Australian Air Force. Previously, a drone design very similar to the LOWUS — if not identical — was presented by Korean Air in the form of an artist’s rendering, seen below. A rendering of what Korean Air pitched as a 'Stealth UAV Squadron' that includes a flying wing-type UCAV and multiple loyal wingman-type drones, with the closest one looking very much like the LOWUS. Korean Air Like the Valkyrie, the LOWUS features a stealthy trapezoidal fuselage, sharply swept main wings, a V-shaped tail, and an air intake located above the fuselage. Unlike the U.S. drone, the South Korean product features an electro-optical sensor in a turret below the nose. The powerplant of the LOWUS is not immediately obvious, although a domestically produced engine has been reported and the video released so far doesn’t reveal details of the internal weapons bay. There are also suggestions that the drone can be fitted with a locally developed active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar. For some time now, we’ve known that South Korea was working on manned-unmanned teaming system. In October 2021 it was announced that Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI), which is leading the KF-21 program, had won a $3.4-million contract from DAPA to rapidly develop technology of this kind, although it’s not immediately clear if this is related to the LOWUS program or a separate effort. However, the KAI initiative was apparently aimed, at least initially, to allow drones to support joint operations involving South Korean battlefield helicopters, such as the Surion and the Light Attack Helicopter (LAH). Previously, we had predicted that these same technologies could later be adapted for future integration of the KF-21 and drones, which may well be what’s happening now. Having a stealth drone available as a loyal wingman for the KF-21 would make a lot of sense, especially since the initial iteration of the fighters lacks the high-end stealth attributes of the F-35, for example, which is also operated by the ROKAF. The KF-21, at least in its initial form, will carry all its disposable armament externally and not in internal weapons bays.

Photo by South Korean Defense Ministry via Getty Images Furthermore, the KF-21 will initially be fielded in the air-to-air-only Block 1 variant, making a drone like the LOWUS, capable of carrying air-to-ground munitions, much more useful as an adjunct to the crewed fighter. This would allow the drone to prosecute ground targets that have been identified by the KF-21, for example. Only with the subsequent Block 2 version will the KF-21 gain an air-to-ground capability. As TWZ wrote in the past: 'More generally, a stealth unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV)carrying internal weapons would be an enormous advantage to the KF-21 Block 1 or Block 2 when penetrating heavily contested airspace. This would allow the manned fighter to remain at a safer standoff distance and use its highly capable Meteor missiles and AESA radar and infrared search and track (IRST) to pick off aerial targets. This could be done perhaps by targeting data received from the UCAV’s own sensors without the need to use the KF-21’s onboard radar at all. This concept is increasingly attractive as it could allow manned fighters to remain largely electromagnetically silent, increasing their survivability, with the drone taking on the higher-risk role as a forward sensing platform.' South Korea is developing the KF-21 to replace the Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF) now-retired F-4E Phantom II and still-active F-5E/F Tiger II fighters. Currently, it’s planned for the ROKAF to introduce 40 KF-21s by 2028 and have a full fleet of 120 aircraft deployed by 2032. For the manned-unmanned teaming component of the KF-21’s operations, it’s likely that the ROKAF will make specific use of the two-seat variant. With accommodation for an additional crewmember, this would make it ideal for the ‘loyal wingman’ drone-controller mission, reflecting the same approach pursued by China, where a two-seat J-20 stealth fighter apparently intended for this mission has been developed. A two-seat KF-21 fighter, the sixth prototype, on display during the Seoul International Aerospace and Defense Exhibition (ADEX) in Seongnam, South Korea, on October 17, 2023. Photo by Zhang Hui/VCG via Getty Images Of course, the LOWUS could also find practical applications beyond the KF-21, including in support of the FA-50 light combat aircraft, providing it these relatively cheap fighters with a much higher degree of survivability. Although based on an advanced jet trainer, the FA-50 is a potent combat platform in its own right, with a multimode radar and precision-guided weapons, including the AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missile and GBU-38/B Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM). It also has twin seats, making it suitable for a drone-controller role. A ROKAF FA-50 light combat aircraft. KAI ROKAF The FA-50 has already found export success and the option of offering for sale with a complementary loyal wingman drone could make it even more attractive, provided that Seoul releases these technologies for sale to foreign customers. Even without the FA-50, or the KF-21, for that matter, the LOWUS could be a compelling export prospect. South Korea is an increasingly major player on the global arms market and a loyal wingman that could be integrated with a range of other combat aircraft would be a unique selling point. As regards Seoul’s stealthy drone programs, we know of previous efforts, most of which have focused on tailless flying-wing designs. For some years now, Korean Air has been working on a stealthy UCAV under the KUS-FC program. A subscale demonstrator, the Kaori-X, began flight testing in 2015. This demonstrator has reportedly been used to test low observability, aerodynamic control and stability, and propulsion concepts. The stealthy, tailless Kaori-X demonstrator developed by Korean Air was unveiled in August 2020. Korean Air In September 2021, the ADD announced that it had mastered critical technologies to allow the production of full-size stealthy UCAVs, the result of a project launched in 2016. In particular, the agency pointed to the development of aerial structures, including RAM, plus flight control algorithms that would help reduce a drone’s radar cross-section. The ADD also described these features being incorporated in a tailless unmanned aerial vehicle. Reports suggest that this effort was separate from but complementary to the KUS-FC program. Concept art from Korean Air showing a possible configuration of the KUS-FC stealthy UCAV. Korean Air Meanwhile, in September 2023, another — much smaller — stealthy-shaped flying wing drone appeared in a military parade in Seoul. Five of these uncrewed aircraft were included in the procession, each mounted on top of a 4×4 light utility vehicle, although the drones’ tricycle landing gear indicates they are intended to take off and land from traditional runways. Although broadly similar in layout to the Kaori-X, the new drones features a ‘cranked kite’ wing configuration, similar to what is seen on the X-47B. South Korean flying wing drones on top of Kia Light Tactical Vehicles (KLTV) on parade in Seoul in September 2023. ANTHONY WALLACE/AFP via Getty Images Overall, drones are very much an area of interest for the South Korean military, which announced the creation of a dedicated drone operations command in September 2023. 'The command will mainly utilize the unmanned assets to carry out defensive and offensive operations and deter various asymmetric threats posed by the enemy, including drones, nuclear weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction during a contingency,' South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) explained at the time, according to a report from South Korean media outlet Yonhap. 'It is also tasked with conducting surveillance, reconnaissance, and strike operations, as well as psychological warfare and electromagnetic warfare at a strategic and operational level.' A DAPA video shows a heavily armed KF-21 (complete with an external targeting pod) flying a mission with three stealthy drones. DAPA screencap Already, the KF-21 is gaining much interest on account of its rapid development timeline and its innovative approach to fielding a new-generation fighter, with certain design compromises having been taken to ease its path into service. With today’s rollout of the Low Observable Unmanned Wingman System drone, another part of the KF-21’s intriguing concept of operations has emerged.

Trump’s Missile Defense Initiative’s Name Changed From Iron Dome ...	From now on, President Donald Trump’s effort to create a hugely expanded missile defense system will be called Golden Dome. 'Please note the Department of Defense has renamed this program from ‘Iron Dome for America’ to ‘Golden Dome for America,' the U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA) wrote in a recent request seeking input from industry on how it could contribute to this effort. This follows what seemed to be an off-hand comment Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth made on Feb. 20. In a video explaining the Pentagon’s budget realignment plans, he listed 'the Golden Dome, or Iron Dome,' as among defense programs that will be protected from any cuts. The MDA RFI seems to have codified that. The new name is starting to gain traction. During his confirmation hearing for the position of deputy defense secretary earlier today, Stephen Feinberg was asked by U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds (R-SD) if he supported the creation of the 'Iron Dome missile defense shield for America, I think some people called it the Golden Dome&#8230;' Feinberg answered in the affirmative. 'If confirmed will you protect the Dept of Defense’s spectrum so that @POTUS Iron Dome (Golden Dome) for America can be built and function optimally?'Feinberg: YES! pic.twitter.com/7zhRZWdax4&mdash; DOD Rapid Response (@DODResponse) February 25, 2025 It is unknown exactly what circumstances prompted the name to be changed. It is clearly a way to distinguish the plan from the wholly unrelated Israeli Iron Dome system. Made by Raytheon and Israel’s Rafael, as seen in the video below, Israel’s Iron Dome is designed primarily to defend against lower-end and localized threats like artillery rockets and mortar shells. It also now has some capability against drones and cruise missiles. The choice of the new name was likely made to invoke Trump’s famously favorite color, gold. We reached out to the Pentagon and the MDA for more details about when the change was made and why. The MDA referred us to the White House, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment. We will update this story with any pertinent details provided. As we have previously reported, one of Trump’s first official acts of his second term was to order the U.S. military to move forward with plans for a massively enlarged missile defense architecture. Dubbed, at the time, Iron Dome, it notably included a call for new space-based anti-missile interceptors. The concept was something Trump talked about on the campaign trail and made official in a Jan. 27 executive order. You can read more about what we knew about the plan before Trump signed it into law in our detailed story here. From our story about the executive order: It calls for a 'next-generation missile defense shield' that 'shall include, at a minimum, plans for' the following eight components: Defense of the United States against ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks from peer, near-peer, and rogue adversaries Acceleration of the deployment of the Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor layer Development and deployment of proliferated space-based interceptors capable of boost-phase intercept Deployment of underlayer and terminal-phase intercept capabilities postured to defeat a countervalue attack Development and deployment of a custody layer of the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture Development and deployment of capabilities to defeat missile attacks prior to launch and in the boost phase Development and deployment of a secure supply chain for all components with next-generation security and resilience features Development and deployment of non-kinetic capabilities to augment the kinetic defeat of ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks' A graphic showing, in a very rudimentary way, the difference in trajectories between a traditional ballistic missile and a hypersonic boost-glide vehicle. GAO MDA is seeking industry feedback on 'innovative acquisition methods or contract vehicles' that could be used to speed up the procurement process of making Golden Dome a reality. The agency wants industry to point out changes needed to 'reduce timelines and avoid delays' and 'obstacles in regulations or policies that impede going ‘fast’ and recommended mitigations.' More specifically, MDA is seeking 'innovative missile defense system technologies, architectures, and concepts to demonstrate and field rapid hypersonic defense capabilities applicable to both regional and homeland defense.' Those capabilities should include, but are not limited to 'near-term, innovative, and disruptive hypersonic defense capabilities across the missile defense kill chain (Left of Launch through Missile Defeat) including sensors and effectors.' The deadline for submitting ideas is Friday. So for a few more days, MDA will revert to the initiative's previous name. 'Since the RFI will close in less than a week, our drop boxes and other related items will remain as ‘Iron Dome for America,’' MDA stated.

China’s Massive WZ-9 Divine Eagle Drone Now Operating From South ...	China's large, jet-powered, twin-fuselage WZ-9 Divine Eagle drone has been operating at least sporadically out of an airbase on the highly-strategic Hainan Island at the northern end of the hotly contested South China Sea since at least December 4th. This is a new indication that this highly important aircraft is now at least in a semi-operational state. The WZ-9 is a high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) uncrewed 'sensor truck' that carries multiple radars capable of spotting and tracking targets over vast areas. These include objects in the air and on the surface below, as well as producing high-quality map-like radar images. While the operational status of the Divine Eagle is unclear, operations from Hainan would make perfect sense for providing valuable broad-area early warning and surveillance coverage out into the South China Sea and potentially far beyond. A satellite image TWZ obtained from Planet Labs, seen below, shows the WZ-9 drone at Ledong Air Base, also known as Foluo Northeast Air Base, on December 4, 2024. Ledong/Folou is a People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) facility situated at Hainan's southwestern end. Hainan is an absolutely critical location for the People's Liberation Army that hosts multiple bases, including two sprawling naval facilities, one of which supports the country's second strike nuclear deterrent and features a submarine cave complex.

Google Earth Two additional drones are seen in the image, one of which is a WZ-7 Soaring Dragon with its own highly distinctive joined-wing design. WZ-7s have been operating from Ledong/Folou since at least 2022. What the other uncrewed aircraft, which has a v-shaped tail, might be is not as immediately obvious, but it could be a member of the popular Wing Loong family. There were also reports that jet-powered WZ-10s, which have v-tails, were flying from the base last year, although the aircraft in the image does not match that more advanced type. Additional satellite images, seen at the top of this story and below, from Maxar Technologies, show the Divine Eagle drone still at Ledong/Folou as of just yesterday. A WZ-7 is again seen alongside the WZ-9 in this satellite image of Ledong/Folou taken on February 24, 2025. Satellite image ©2025 Maxar Technologies Satellite image ©2025 Maxar Technologies Details about the WZ-9, the development of which reportedly traces back at least to the early 2010s, remain limited and it's unknown how many examples may currently exist. Imagery of the exotic-looking Divine Eagle that has emerged to date, along with renderings and models, show it has a very long high-aspect-ratio wing at the rear, as well as a smaller wing structure between the front ends of the two fuselages serving as a forward stabilizer. The drone is powered by a single jet engine mounted in a nacelle pod on top of the main wing between its two vertical tails. Chinese interest The span of the WZ-9's main wing is around 147 feet (45 meters), but its overall length is just shy of 50 feet (15 meters). For comparison, the U.S. RQ-4 Global Hawk HALE drone has a wingspan of just under 131 feet (nearly 40 meters) and is almost 48 feet (14.5 meters) long. At least one model has previously emerged indicating that the WZ-9 has at least two large side-looking radars (SLARs), one in each fuselage facing outward. These radars may have ground moving-target indicator and air moving-target indicator (GMTI/AMTI) capabilities, as well as the ability to produce synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. Not sure how credible this desk-top model of the WZ-9 Divine Eagle AEW UAV is, but it shows the internal structure of the antenna array.Also it is the first time a model of the WZ-9 (?) is carrying the PLAAF symbol.(Image via 柳成梁/FB) pic.twitter.com/rIcb4AZhRH&mdash; @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) December 18, 2022 The WZ-9 may have made its maiden flight in 2015 and Divine Eagles have been seen in the skies above parts of China since then, including in a video seen immediately below that emerged online in December. 神雕ことWZ-9 Divine Eagleの飛行映像だ……対ステルスも考慮された大型の早期警戒UAVです。ちょくちょく目撃例は上がってましたが何れも衛星画像や飛行中の画像で、飛行中の映像が確認されたのはこれが初なはずです。 pic.twitter.com/WUZzzZda8k&mdash; お砂糖wsnbn (@sugar_wsnbn) December 28, 2024 Un #drone HALE WZ-9 a été photographié fin Juillet par un internaute chinois à Anshun, dans la province du Guizhou, près de l’usine d’assemblage de GAIC. pic.twitter.com/kFjcmK31Cl&mdash; East Pendulum (@HenriKenhmann) August 6, 2023 Divine Eagles have also been spotted in past satellite imagery on the ground at manufacturer Shenyang Air Corporation’s main plant in the city of the same name, the PLA Air Force's (PLAAF) Malan Air Base test and evaluation hub in far western Xinjiang Province, and Anshun Huangguoshu Airport in southeastern Guizhou Province. Even more interesting, not only the WZ-7s but also - and in my opinion a first - the Soaring Dragon (WZ-9 ?) are painted grey in PLAAF colours. pic.twitter.com/Tq5U9vAhnA&mdash; @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) October 24, 2023 What the WZ-9's maximum range and endurance might be is unknown. TWZ has noted in the past that the design looks intended to fill a need for a higher-end HALE design as higher-performing counterpart to the WZ-7 that is designed around the ability to carry two large radar arrays. Advanced passive radio frequency detection capabilities are also likely to be present on the WZ-9. Reports about the Divine Eagle's have also long pointed to the airborne early warning role in addition to the ability to perform other intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions, whereas the WZ-7 has been more focused on general ISR. The PLAAF and the PLAN have already fielded an impressive array of increasingly capable crewed airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft, the majority of which are turboprop-powered designs, as you can read more about in this past TWZ feature. The PLA continues to make significant investments in this area. A new AEW&C aircraft based on the Y-20 four-engine jet-powered cargo plane, offering advantages in terms of speed, range, on-station time, and altitude over turboprop types, is now in development. A turboprop-powered KJ-500A, one of China's most modern airborne early warning and control aircraft in service currently. This particular example has an aerial refueling probe. Chinese Internet The HALE WZ-9 would fit in well with this existing AEW&C ecosystem. Altitude is especially important for the airborne early warning mission, particularly when it comes ‘look down’ capability to find low-flying aircraft and missiles that radars down below might not be able to ‘see’ because of terrain and other factors. A higher perch also offers a much better line of sight, which can increase the area a single platform can surveil. As already noted, the current operational status of the WZ-9 is not clear, but the presence of a Divine Eagle in Hainan for months now could point to the drone being at a very mature phase of testing or even semi-operational, if not fully operational. Basing the drone at Ledong/Folou makes good sense from an operational perspective, too. From there, Divine Eagles could monitor broad swaths of the South China Sea. China claims the bulk of this body of water as its national territory, something that is not recognized by the vast majority of the international community. The PLA has been working for years now to expand its anti-access and area denial capabilities (A2/AD) in the region to help assert its claims. This includes a number of man-made islands with airstrips that also host anti-ship and surface-to-air missile batteries. A map showing estimated ranges and endurances for various Chinese crewed and uncrewed ISR platforms when operating from man-made outposts in the South China Sea giving a sense of existing coverage capacity. Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory As part of the PLA's A2/AD strategy in the South China Sea, WZ-9s could fly more persistent orbits for long periods, covering broader areas than their manned counterparts. In this capacity, the WZ-9 would also be able to act as a highly valuable source of situational awareness and targeting data. This includes providing key data for air, ground, and ship-launched missiles. The Divine Eagle is large enough that it might be able to take on additional roles, including as a communications signal relay, in the future. WZ-9 flying from Hainan could also conduct similar missions to the north around Taiwan, but they could be an even more powerful force multiplier further out into the Pacific. Divine Eagles could stage from other bases across China to provide coverage of this vast and desolate space, working as a critical component of complex kill chains stationed at the forward edge. Data from its radars could provide critical real-time targeting updates for long-range weapons and detect enemy aerial and surface movements from extreme standoff ranges. The aircraft could also play a role in areas at the center of other territorial disputes, as well as overland, especially along the country's contested borders with India, although just how optimized its radar and software is to the maritime environment isn't known. All of this follows the PLA's increasing use of drones overall to conduct more persistent surveillance of areas of high strategic interest, as well as China's general pursuit of ever-more capable uncrewed aircraft, in recent years. The WZ-9, which has now emerged in the highly strategic South China Sea, is well in line with those trends.

France Eyeing Deployment Of Nuclear-Armed Rafale Fighters To Germ...	France is apparently looking at the possibility of deploying air-launched nuclear weapons to Germany, a consideration that’s being made amid growing concerns that the United States will no longer guarantee European security under NATO. Broader discussions about nuclear deterrence among European leaders point very clearly to the deepening crisis in the transatlantic alliance under U.S. President Donald Trump, emphasized by calls from German leader-in-waiting Friedrich Merz for talks with his British and French colleagues about European 'nuclear sharing or at least nuclear security.' According to a report in the British newspaper The Telegraph, which cites an unnamed French official, 'Posting a few French nuclear jet fighters in Germany should not be difficult and would send a strong message' to Russia, which would aim to bolster Europe’s nuclear deterrent. A French Air and Space Force Rafale B over Ramstein Air Base in Germany, during NATO exercises in June 2024. Photo by Thomas Lohnes/Getty Images Thomas Lohnes While it’s unclear how seriously the proposal is being discussed at the highest levels in France, there is a logic behind raising the idea at this point in public. In France, there is now an increasing focus on building up Europe’s capacity to provide a defensive bulwark against Russia, as Trump shifts to embrace Moscow. The result has been a growing rift between the United States and its European NATO allies, with differing positions on the continued provision of support for Ukraine looming large. Evidence of this fractious relationship was provided in a meeting between Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron in Washington yesterday, in which Ukraine was again atop the agenda. Trump refused to provide security guarantees to Ukraine once a potential peace deal is signed.

Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images The Washington Post Macron warned Trump against a 'surrender' of Ukraine, while the U.S. president claimed that Putin 'wants to make a deal' that might include European peacekeepers. The talks took place just hours after the United States voted against a United Nations resolution drafted by Ukraine and the European Union condemning Russia for its invasion. Macron interrupted Trump and corrected him on how much Europe spends on defense and he also called on Europe to do more collectively to protect the continent. Now, it seems, stationing French nuclear weapons in Germany is being assessed as one way of extending Europe’s deterrence, in the potential absence of U.S. security guarantees. Before his meeting with Trump, Macron had talks with Merz, who is expected to be the next German chancellor after winning elections in the country last weekend. Friedrich Merz, set to be the next German chancellor, stands in front of a German Luftwaffe Eurofighter EF2000 at Rostock-Laage Air Base in June 2024. Photo by Michael Kappeler/picture alliance via Getty Images picture alliance For his part, Merz has also been promoting the idea of increased European independence from U.S. security guarantees, including extended nuclear protection from France and the United Kingdom — the only two NATO countries in Europe with sovereign nuclear deterrence capabilities. 'We need to have discussions with both the British and the French — the two European nuclear powers — about whether nuclear sharing or at least nuclear security from the United Kingdom and France, could also apply to us,' Merz said last week. He then went on to warn that the United States was now 'indifferent to the fate of Europe.' This statement came after U.S. Vice President JD Vance had suggested that American troops might be pulled out of bases in Germany, where they have been ever-present since the end of World War II. The Telegraph story cites German diplomats as suggesting that the French proposal to station their nuclear weapons in Germany could prompt the United Kingdom to do the same. Currently, however, the United Kingdom relies exclusively on a submarine-based nuclear deterrent, based around Trident 2 D5 missiles. A U.K. Royal Navy Vanguard class submarine, which currently provides the U.K.’s Continuous at Sea Deterrent. Each of the four boats is armed with Trident 2 D5 nuclear missiles. Crown Copyright PO(PHOT) IAN ARTHUR France, meanwhile, has both submarine-launched ballistic missiles and air-launched nuclear missiles of its own design. More importantly, these weapons are technically independent of NATO nuclear planning, unlike the British nuclear deterrent, which is also closely intertwined with that of the United States. How this would all play out when confronted by the realities of a nuclear conflict involving NATO is unclear, but it does at least provide Paris with more flexibility when it comes to discussions of how its nuclear umbrella might be extended to European NATO allies. The suggestion of 'a few French nuclear jet fighters in Germany' would involve French Air and Space Force Dassault Rafale multirole righters, armed with ASMP-A standoff missiles. These are part of France’s Forces Aériennes Stratégiques (FAS, Strategic Air Forces), which were established back in 1964. In fact, during the 1960s, France had F-100D/F Super Sabre jet fighters stationed at two bases in West Germany, armed with U.S.-supplied tactical nuclear bombs. A French Air Force F-100D at Toul-Rosières Air Base France in June 1970. French Air Force However, the ASMP-A is a sovereign capability and not part of the ‘dual-key’ arrangement that still provides U.S.-supplied B61 nuclear bombs for use by NATO air arms in Europe. Currently, the French Air and Space Force’s nuclear assets are based around roughly 50 two-seat Rafale Bs, which are located at Saint Dizier-Robinson Air Base and are supported by a fleet of Airbus A330 MRTT Phénix aerial refueling tankers. As well as two air force squadrons with nuclear-tasked Rafale Bs, the French Navy also operates navalized Rafale Ms from the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle, which can also be armed with ASMP-A.

Photo by FRANCOIS NASCIMBENI/AFP via Getty Images FRANCOIS NASCIMBENI As for the missile itself, this is a medium-range supersonic standoff cruise missile equipped with a thermonuclear warhead of around 300 kilotons. Its liquid-fuel ramjet engine powers it at speeds of Mach 3 over a maximum range of around 500 kilometers (310 miles), depending on the flight profile. In 2015, the then-president of France, François Hollande, confirmed that France had 54 operational ASMP-A missiles. Clearly, a detachment of aircraft and missiles at an air base in Germany would be a significant burden on France’s hard-worked Rafale fleet, although it would not be impossible. At the same time, France is also preparing to add to its Rafale fleet, as part of increasing investment in its armed forces across the board. Last weekend, France’s Minister of the Armed Forces, Sébastien Lecornu, took to social media platform X, calling for Europe to 'accelerate our rearmament,' and outlining plans for France to buy up to 30 additional Rafales, three more frigates, more drones, and electronic warfare platforms. It’s unclear if the French proposal is intended to supplement the U.S.-supplied weapons on German soil, but it seems more likely it’s envisaged as an emergency measure should the United States remove or scale back its critical role in the NATO nuclear-sharing arrangement. Under this, U.S.-owned B61 bombs are also housed in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Turkey, and can be employed by tactical jet aircraft from approved member states. Turkey notably hosts B61s but is not among the countries that could employ them.

Public Domain/Wikimedia Commons At present, Germany has around 20 U.S.-owned B61 nuclear bombs at Büchel Air Base, where they are provided for the German Luftwaffe’s Tornado swing-wing strike aircraft. This base is midway through an upgrade that is adding, among others, a service area for Germany’s future nuclear-capable F-35As and a refurbished runway. Those stealth fighters were acquired by Germany primarily on the basis of them being able to continue the nuclear mission, armed with the latest B61-12 version of the bomb.

Photo by Thomas Frey/picture alliance via Getty Images picture alliance Notably, Trump has regularly spoken about the possibility of slashing the U.S. nuclear inventory as part of a future arms deal. With that in mind, a dialing back or even an ending of the nuclear-sharing program could also emerge as a significant cost-cutting measure. At the same time, it’s conceivable that such a move could be made in parallel with the likely return of B61s to the United Kingdom, which may be an attractive move to ensure there is still U.S.-provided European deterrence coverage, albeit at a lower level than now. Whatever comes of the latest proposal, it’s the latest example of Europe’s leading NATO nations taking another look at how nuclear deterrence works on the continent and whether it should be expanded, independent of the United States. The idea of some kind of European nuclear deterrent has also been raised in the past by France. In fact, as long ago as 2007, France proposed talks with Germany on sharing its nuclear arsenal, although Berlin was unmoved. The theme was raised again in 2020, by Macron, who suggested a 'Europeanized' French nuclear deterrence.

Photo by BOB EDME/POOL/AFP via Getty Images BOB EDME More recently, Macron has called for further discussions on the topic, likely to involve Germany and the United Kingdom, and, for the first time, such proposals seem to be gaining traction with European allies. A 'Europeanized' nuclear deterrence scenario, in the short term at least, would be reliant on French air-launched nuclear weapons, which are the only examples of their kind in NATO not owned by the United States and which offer the flexibility to be deployed at air bases across Europe — provided the local infrastructure has been upgraded to support and securely store them. An unnamed German diplomat told The Telegraph that they considered that Merz and his CDU party — now the strongest single force in German politics — believe that 'a nuclear umbrella' is needed for Europe, outside of the ‘dual-key’ arrangement with the United States. 'We want to have a say in this, we should be ready to talk about this, and we are willing to pay for it,' the same diplomat added. TWZ spoke to Hans Kristensen, the director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists for their thoughts on the French proposal, which he said was 'understandable … given what’s happening in the United States.' But he also noted that there were more than a few questions about the plan and its utility. 'France and the United Kingdom are already nuclear members of NATO, and although the French arsenal is officially independent, it’s an illusion to imagine France staying outside a European conflict that rises to the level of nuclear weapons,' Kristensen remarked. 'France has less than 50 air-based missiles and ‘offering’ deployment in Germany would immediately raise issues about the much wider nuclear posture in Europe,' he continued, before noting the difference between France’s ‘strategic’ ASMP-A and the ‘dual-key’ B61s held by the United States in Europe that are classified as ‘tactical’ weapons.

Photo by Jean GUICHARD/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images Jean GUICHARD 'Would this mean that France’s air-delivered nukes are tactical after all? What would that mean for French nuclear policy that insists its nukes are not tactical? What about the other allies; why don’t they get deployment? How capable would a French bomber umbrella actually be given Russia’s much larger nuclear arsenal? Why would this have any additional reassuring impact on reassuring Germany/Europe than the current posture has? Why would it have any positive impact on Russia?' 'It’s so easy to throw up symbolic chest-thumping initiatives these days, but supporters have to be careful about creating hollow postures with commitment traps,' Kristensen observed. 'If Europe wants to help deterrence and reassurance, it should focus on conventional capabilities that it can actually use and let nukes stay in the background where they belong.' TWZ also spoke to Dmitry Stefanovich, a research fellow at the Center for International Security, IMEMO RAS, who provided his assessment of the latest French proposal. 'Clearly, France seems to be the natural provider of such a nuclear umbrella, and actually to some extent, it is already the case, judging by the language used by Macron labeling European security a French vital interest. However, I have doubts that the materialization of this umbrella can take the form of the actual deployment of nuclear weapons in Germany or elsewhere. Some sort of ‘European conventional support to nuclear operations’ seems more realistic, i.e. conventional jets, tankers, or airborne early warning and control aircraft joining the French Poker [nuclear readiness] exercise or something like that. Moreover, French Rafales from ‘nuclear’ units already participate in Baltic Air Policing missions, and something like that in practice, but labeled with ‘nuclear flavor’ and including deployment and joint flights in other European countries is also possible.' Stefanovich also noted how the actual deployment of nuclear weapons could be promoted as a substitute in case the United States does finally decide to pull its nuclear weapons out of Europe, in which case the United Kingdom would be the likely exception. 'I find this scenario very unlikely,' Stefanovich added. 'But still, it might be a step towards achieving a more stable security architecture in the region, including Russia. And French forward-deployed nukes might be traded for some Russian forward deployments.' Ultimately, it might not even take these questions to derail any plans for a deployment of French nuclear weapons in Germany, since such a move would only really be likely were the United States to pull its nuclear weapons out of Germany — and potentially out of other NATO countries too. At this point, that doesn’t look to be on the agenda, but it’s nonetheless highly significant that European NATO leaders are at least starting to imagine a future security environment where this could happen.

Third Anniversary Of Ukraine War Markedly Different Than Previous...	Last February, when Ukraine marked the second anniversary of the full-on invasion by Russia, the geopolitical chess pieces were in vastly different positions than they are today, the third anniversary of the war. The U.S., Ukraine’s staunch benefactor, has made a stunning course correction under President Donald Trump. The new administration has opened up direct negotiations with Russia without Ukraine at the table and has put into question America's commitment to NATO. A deal to obtain rights to Ukraine’s mineral reserves that Trump says will recoup America's investment in the war effort has also spurred a backlash in Kyiv. Perhaps nothing is more illustrative of this change than the U.S. siding with Russia, North Korea, Iran and 14 other Moscow allies Monday against a resolution condemning Russian aggression in Ukraine and calling for the return of Ukrainian territory. #BREAKINGUN General Assembly ADOPTS resolution 'Advancing a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine'; calls for deescalation, early cessation of hostilities and peaceful resolution of the war against UkraineRESULTIn favor: 93Against: 18Abstain: 65 pic.twitter.com/VhQ5Y1W2il&mdash; UN News (@UN_News_Centre) February 24, 2025 Meanwhile, Ukraine is feeling the effects of the slow provision of arms by the Biden administration. It is on its heels across a 600-mile front line in a grinding, bloody fight that is resulting in the slow loss of territory in critical areas. Any gains by either side have come at a tremendous cost to both sides. Ukraine’s salient in Russia’s Kursk region has been greatly reduced since its peak last fall. Overall, the Ukrainian armed forces are facing a glaring manpower deficit, which puts into question its ability to sustain the status quo. One reason for Trump’s embrace of Putin is his desire to drive a wedge between Moscow and Beijing, The Wall Street Journal recently suggested. A briefing memo obtained by the Journal 'suggested that Moscow propose ending cooperation with China on sensitive technological and military issues as part of a deal to end the war in Ukraine on terms favorable to Russia.' Moscow 'could also offer to limit Chinese participation in infrastructure projects that would strengthen China’s strategic capabilities,' the memo said. 'It also suggested a pledge by Russia to limit the resumption of natural gas exports to Europe to undermine European competitiveness and to allow sales of American liquefied natural gas, as well as offers to grant U.S. companies rights to mineral deposits in occupied Ukraine.' However, prying Moscow and Beijing apart would be difficult at best. With a 'no-limits' friendship agreement, the two have deep military and intelligence ties and China has provided computer chips and machine tools the Russian military has relied on.

'For me, the absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA' in defense matters,' Friedrich Merz said. Leader of the center-right CDU/CSU alliance, Merz said he had 'no illusions at all about what is coming out of America.' 'After Donald Trump's statements in the last week, it is clear that the Americans are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe,' he said on German television following national elections. 'I'm very curious to see how we head toward the NATO summit at the end of June — whether we will still be talking about NATO in its current form or whether we will have to establish an independent European defense capability much more quickly,' Merz added. Germany has contributed the second most military aid to Ukraine, trailing only the U.S., according to the Kiel Institute For The World Economy’s Ukraine Support Tracker. Merz’s election could be good news for Ukraine. As we previously reported, he favors providing Kyiv with air-launched Taurus KEPD 350 cruise missiles, a 180-degree change from outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

The €40bn figure was mentioned by one member state and is seen as an outlier. The EU says it gave Ukraine €20bn ($21 billion) in military aid in 2024, a figure that is a starting point for the latest plan on the table. EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, suggested that the alliance 'would send Ukraine 'as soon as possible' at least 1.5m rounds of large-caliber ammunition, air-defense systems, missiles capable of deep precision strikes, drones, as well as offering training to brigades,' The Guardian reported. A decision is being passed to EU leaders, who will gather for an emergency summit in Brussels next Thursday, where they will also discuss European defense.

'Russia dedicated staggering amounts of manpower and equipment to several major offensive efforts in Ukraine in 2024, intending to degrade Ukrainian defenses and seize the remainder of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts,' ISW assessed. 'These Russian efforts included major operations in the Kharkiv-Luhansk Oblast area, Avdiivka, Chasiv Yar, northern Kharkiv Oblast, Toretsk, Marinka-Kurakhove, Pokrovsk, and Vuhledar-Velyka Novosilka.

'I am not going to recognize $500 (billion),' Zelensky said during a press conference at a forum marking the third anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. That could take 250 years, Zelensky noted, adding that he could not sign anything that 'ten generations of Ukrainians' would have to pay back. Yesterday, Zelensky pushed back against Trump's demands. 'I know we had $100bn [of US assistance] but I’m not going to acknowledge $500bn, no matter what anyone says. I’m not going to sign something that 10 generations of Ukrainians will be paying for.' Christopher Miller (@ChristopherJM) February 24, 2025 Another reported objection to the deal was the U.S. threatening to cut off Elon Musk's Starlink internet system widely used by front-line units if Ukraine didn't agree to the terms. That report is now in question based on statements from Ukrainian officials. Regardless, Ukraine has alternatives for that system and is making decisions about the use of the technology, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said at the Ukraine: Year 2025 forum in Kyiv on Sunday. The head of Ukraine's Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR) said so far, Musk's Space X has not prevented Ukraine from using its Starlink satellite communications system. '​​The U.S. has the ability to remotely cut off Starlink connections and has previously turned off Starlinks belonging to Russian forces in the military ‘gray zone’, akin to no man’s land,' Lt. Gen.

Zelensky, for instance, suggested that in return for Ukrainian membership in NATO, he would be willing to resign. 'If (it guarantees) peace for Ukraine, if you really need me to resign, I am ready. I can exchange it for NATO,' he told reporters on Sunday. His statement came after Trump said that Zelensky needs to run for reelection again and declared him a dictator because he has frozen elections since the war began. As we previously reported, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that Kyiv joining NATO was unrealistic, upending the alliance’s stated policy that Ukraine was on an 'irreversible path' to membership.

'We hope that we can finish the war this year,' he said. Budanov said that he believes there will be a ceasefire with Russia this year, but its duration remains questionable. He described the situation as 'paradoxical' since the positions of Kyiv and Moscow are drastically opposite. 'At the same time, I think we will reach a ceasefire this year,' Budanov said. 'How long it will be, how effective it will be, is another question. But I think it will happen. Most of the components needed for this to happen are there.' Budanov added that he does not believe a peacekeeping force, like the one proposed by European leaders, will do much good. 'Can this be considered a guarantee?' he asked rhetorically. 'It’s questionable—let’s just say, very much in doubt.' The war could end in 2025 as Russia needs a pause due to lack of forces and high financial costs, – GUR chief Budanov said.'I have seen their strategic planning until 2045: if it does not get out of the conflict by 2026, then in the coming years it will lose its chances of… pic.twitter.com/39WnbbHJLW&mdash; NOELREPORTS (@NOELreports) February 23, 2025 As Budanov noted, nothing is set in stone when it comes to the future of this war. Though his forces have taken tremendous casualties and he is facing economic pressures at home, Putin sees his troops on the offensive and may decide it is to his advantage to continue fighting. Ukraine meanwhile, though exhausted, has little faith that Russia would live up to any agreements it signs. Still, there is a growing sense that Feb. 24, 2026 won't presage a fifth year of fighting. The Latest On the battlefield, the front lines continued to remain largely stagnant with Russia making some small gains in Luhansk Oblast while both sides inched forward in parts of Donetsk. Here are some key takeaways from the latest ISW assessment: Kursk: Russian forces continued offensive operations in Kursk Oblast on February 23 but did not make any confirmed advances. Kharkiv: Russian forces continued ground attacks in the Kharkiv direction on February 23 but did not advance. Luhansk: Russian forces continued ground attacks in the Kupyansk, Borova and Lyman directions on February 23 but did not make confirmed advances. Donetsk: Russian forces advanced in the Pokrovsk and Siversk directions while Ukraine advanced near Toretsk.

'There is no U.S. base in Alexandroupolis - it is a Greek facility that the U.S. has access to under the Mutual Defense Cooperation Agreement,' a U.S. defense official told The War Zone Monday morning. 'It simply serves as a surface transportation hub when U.S. equipment flows into and out of Europe. US transport personnel can surge to the location to manage episodic arrivals and departures of equipment, but this is not a US ‘base’ for the US to close.' The U.S. official's comments are in response to our questions about the future of this hub raised by Greek media. 'As the direct talks between the US and Russian delegations on the fate of Ukraine are considered positive and productive, the Trump administration will no longer send American material and personnel to Ukraine against Russia and therefore the American base in Alexandroupolis may be considered unnecessary,' the Greek gnomionline media outlet reported. In addition to not being a U.S. base to close, the official told us there was no anticipated change in the flow of equipment from the port. 'The U.S. population changes depending on the shipments, so it wouldn’t be strange for a small footprint to be there depending on the day,' the official added. 'Priority access to the Port of Alexandroupolis in northeastern Greece has allowed the U.S. military to continue to support Ukraine as that nation fights to maintain its sovereignty following the unprovoked February 24 invasion by Russia, the U.S. defense secretary told his Greek counterpart,' the Pentagon said in a statement released in July 2022, about five months after Russia launched its full-on invasion.

The F-16s are serving as escort aircraft for Ukraine’s Soviet-era MiG-29 Fulcrum bomb trucks. 'They fly in groups of three aircraft,' Rybar claimed. 'One F-16 and two MiG-29s, which act not only as cover aircraft but also to carry out strikes - the latter are armed with JDAM and Hammer guided air bombs.' The MiG-29s 'fly close to the border, while American aircraft keep a distance,' Rybar posited. 'Most likely, they act as ‘hunters’ for our aircraft. Colleagues noted that the F-16s are armed with AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAMs). As we recently reported, Ukraine is also using the Vipers on air-to-ground missions, which you can read more about here.

That’s probably 'because it perceives the demobilization of Russian veterans as a potential threat to regime stability.'

Taiwan Is Testing An Air Launched Supersonic Anti-Ship Missile	Taiwan appears to be moving toward adding a supersonic anti-ship cruise missile to its F-CK-1C/D Indigenous Defense Fighters (IDF). The current timeline for the introduction of the air-launched version of the homegrown HF-3 missile is unclear, but when fully integrated, it will provide the Republic of China Air Force (ROCAF) with a powerful new capability to better counter China’s growing naval might. A photo of an F-CK-1 carrying HF-3 missile was recently published by Taiwan’s United Daily News. The image, submitted by an anonymous reader of that newspaper, appears to show test rounds of the missile, which is part of the Hsiung Feng, or Brave Wind series. One of the large missiles is carried under each wing. The jet also has a 275-gallon fuel tank under the fuselage and AIM-9P Sidewinder air-to-air missiles on the wingtip stations. The HF-3 carries calibration marks, of the kind used to make it easier to monitor a store after launch. UDN published what appears to be the first clear image of an air-launched HF-3 dummy round, if not shopped.It seems to have a rotating sleeve at the end for initial stabilization? pic.twitter.com/KRrfTdqQ37&mdash; Taepodong (@stoa1984) February 21, 2025 Liberty Times just published another image.If goes well, it could lend the F-CK-1 a second life, maybe even leading to further development of an indigenous support fighter (ISF) — that is me fantasizing. pic.twitter.com/9UqHKZotBB&mdash; Taepodong (@stoa1984) February 21, 2025 The article notes that the ROCAF and the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST) have resumed work on the air-launched HF-3, 'which was previously reported to have been stalled for a long time.' The NCSIST, which originally developed the HF-3 for launch from warships and ground launchers, is a state research and development agency broadly similar to the Pentagon’s DARPA but with its own production capability. Reportedly, work originally began in 2022 to reduce the size of the HF-3 for aircraft carriage, including plans for the production of a small batch of the ‘compact’ version of the missile. The UDN story notes that, at some point after this, the project was suspended, but work had been restarted by September 2024, with further research and tests conducted 'in the sea and air.' As a result, the air-launched HF-3 should be ready to undergo operational evaluation later this year. A model of a surface/ground-launched HF-3 missile. The additional solid-propellant boosters are removed from the air-launched version. 玄史生/Wikimedia Commons The original plan for the air-launched HF-3 was intended to be completed by 2028, although it’s not immediately clear if this has since changed as a result of the program pause. According to the UDN report, the air-launched version of the HF-3 is 5.5 meters (18 feet) long, with a diameter of no more than 36 centimeters (14 inches), and a weight of less than 900 kilograms (1,980 pounds). The original HF-3 was 6.1 meters (20 feet) long, with a diameter of 46 centimeters (18 inches), and weighed around 1,400kg kilograms (3,090 pounds). As an air-launched anti-ship weapon, the HF-3 offers several notable advantages over the U.S.-supplied AGM-84 Harpoon otherwise used by the ROCAF in this role — although this is not compatible with the F-CK-1, instead being used by the F-16, as you can read about here. A ROCAF F-16 armed with Harpoon missiles during an anti-invasion drill on a highway road in Chang-Hua, Taiwan, in May 2019. Photo by Patrick Aventurier/Getty Images Aventurier Patrick The HF-3’s liquid-fuel ramjet motor provides supersonic performance, compared to the subsonic Harpoon. With a top speed of Mach 3.5, the HF-3 is much harder to defend against. Range figures published for the missile differ, with some accounts suggesting a short-range version can hit targets at around 120-150 kilometers (75-93 miles), increasing to 300-400 kilometers (186-249 miles) in long-range form. It’s unclear which version the air-launched HF-3 best corresponds to. However, launching the missile from a fast-moving fighter at altitude should help boost overall range regardless. In comparison, the air-launched Harpoon has a range of around 80 miles in the AGM-84L form that is the most capable model operated by the ROCAF. At the same time, air launch obviates the need for separate booster motors to bring the HF-3 up to the speed at which the ramjet can start to operate. According to reports, removing the solid-propellant boosters trimmed around 200 kilograms (440 pounds) from the missile’s weight, helping make it more suitable for aircraft carriage. However, further weight and size-reduction measures were still necessary. Like Harpoon, the HF-3 is guided by an inertial navigation system (INS) with terminal active radar homing. In surface/ground-launched form it is armed with a 265-pound high-explosive, semi-armor piercing warhead, although this may well be smaller in the air-launched version. The warhead is reportedly triggered by a smart fuse designed to direct most of the explosive energy downward, into the ship’s hull, for maximum destructive effect. Test launch of an HF-3 missile from a Tuo Chiang class corvette of the Republic of China Navy. Taiwan Ministry of National Defense Chinese naval forces have been rapidly expanding in recent years, in general, which has already prompted the Taiwanese military to seek a variety of new and improved anti-ship capabilities. Anti-ship missiles launched from the land, from warships, and from ROCAF fighters are already a very important component of Taiwan’s defensive plans, designed to thwart a potential Chinese move on the island. In an ROCAF context, TWZ has previously reported: 'The pairing of F-16 and AGM-84 Harpoon is a key element in Taiwan’s ability to defend important strategic waterways and territorial claims against a maritime opponent. The ROCAF operates a mix of older Harpoons plus the newer Block II AGM-84Ls.' You can read more about Taiwan’s AGM-84s here and about the missile in general in this past TWZ piece. A model of an HF-3 missile during the Kaohsiung International Maritime and Defense Exhibition in 2016. SAM YEH/AFP via Getty Images SAM YEH The air-launched HF-3 would be a potent complement to the Harpoon. This is especially true when it comes to pushing anti-ship missile kill zones farther from Taiwan’s shores and in a far more unpredictable and responsive manner. However, it would likely be limited to carriage by the F-CK-1, at least in the shorter term. If a war with China were to break out, anti-ship missiles of all kinds would be absolutely critical in providing Taiwan with any hope of slowing an all-out advance by the People’s Liberation Army Navy. As such, the continued effort to field a more capable air-launched anti-ship missile is increasingly seen as a necessary deterrent as tensions between Taipei and Beijing continue.

Aircraft Carrier USS Harry S. Truman Back At Sea After Collision ...	The U.S. Navy aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman is back at sea conducting routine operations after a week or so in port in Greece for repairs. Truman collided with the cargo ship M/V Besiktas-M in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Egypt’s Port Said earlier this month. The Navy announced today that Truman is now conducting routine operations in the Mediterranean after leaving Greece's Souda Bay yesterday following a so-called Emergent Repair Availability (ERAV). The carrier first arrived in Souda Bay for the ERAV, which was immediately preceded by a more comprehensive damage assessment, on February 16. The collision, which occured on February 12, had caused damage to various parts of the aft starboard end of the flattop, as you can read more about here. Engineering department officers, assigned to the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75) and Forward Deployed Regional Maintenance Center inspectors assess the exterior damage of the ship on February 16, 2025, while completing an emergent repair availability at U.S. Naval Support Activity (NSA) Souda Bay. USN Seaman Michael Gomez 'Led by Forward Deployed Regional Maintenance Center (FDRMC), Truman completed the five-day ERAV at Naval Support Activity (NSA) Souda Bay, Greece,' according to a Navy press release. 'In an all-hands effort, Sailors worked with FDRMC personnel, Norfolk Naval Shipyard, and local industry partner Theodoropoulos Group to assess damage, develop a repair plan, and restore weathertight integrity to the ship following the collision on Feb. 12.' A picture the Navy previously released showing damage to the aft starboard end of the USS Harry S. Truman following the collision with the M/V Besiktas-M. USN Another look at some of the collision damage to Truman. USN 'FDRMC is focused on keeping our forward-deployed naval forces mission-ready across 5th and 6th Fleets, maintaining critical combat readiness for the ships and their Sailors,' Navy Capt. Mollie Bily, the FDRMC's commanding officer, said in a statement. 'The rapid repair effort on Truman was a testament to our expeditionary maintenance expertise and the exceptional collaboration with our Norfolk Naval Shipyard teammates and industry partners.' The Navy has not yet released any details about the cost of these repairs or of the total damage Truman sustained in the collision. What additional repairs might still be required and what the timeline might be for conducting that work is unknown. TWZ has reached for more information. 'Our ship remains operationally ready to complete deployment with mission and purpose on full display by the entire crew,' Navy Capt. Christopher Hill, Truman's commanding officer, also said in a statement. 'We are out here launching and recovering aircraft, ready to ‘Give ‘em Hell’ with combat credible power.' An F/A-18 Super Hornet launches from the USS Harry S. Truman on February 15, 2025. USN MC2 Emily Guillory Also known by his callsign 'Chowdah,' Hill took command of the Truman on February 20 after the Navy relieved Capt. Dave Snowden 'due to a loss of confidence in his ability to command' following the collision. An investigation into the incident remains underway. Chowdah Hill is stepping in. Quite the endorsement from the USN Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) February 20, 2025 Hill had previously commanded the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower during a deployment between November 2023 and June 2024 that included months of intense combat in and around the Red Sea. You can learn more about that cruise in our exclusive interview with 'Chowdah' Hill. Prior to the collision, Truman and its embarked air wing, as well as the rest of its strike group, had also been conducting operations in and around the Red Sea. 'Since deploying, Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 1 has flown over 5,500 sorties, including two self-defense strikes into Houthi-controlled Yemen territory and a large force strike against ISIS-Somalia targets in Northeast Somalia in coordination with U.S. Africa Command,' according to today's Navy release. 'The Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group continues to provide maritime security and regional stability in support of its component commanders.' TWZ has previously highlighted the importance of getting Truman, the only U.S. carrier currently in the region, back on station as quickly as possible to avoid any major operational impacts. In addition, performing even limited no-notice repairs at Souda Bay could have provided the Navy with useful data to help refine and improve procedures for handling battle damage on forward-deployed ships. The service's current capacity, or lack thereof, to readily repair battle-damaged ships has been a particular area of concern for years now, especially in the context of preparing for a future high-end fight, such as one against China in the Pacific. Whatever repairs Truman might still require, the carrier is now back conducting routine operations. Contact the author: joe@twz.com The post Aircraft Carrier USS Harry S.

Su-57 Felon’s First Visit To Iran Seen In Satellite Imagery	A Russian Su-57 Felon fighter recently touched down in Iran on its way back home from the Aero India 2025 international airshow. This appears to be the first known instance of one of the new-generation Russian jets stopping over in Iran for any reason. Satellite imagery indicates the Felon was at the Iranian airbase in Bandar Abbas in the southeastern end of the country for multiple days, and it is not entirely clear if it has now departed. TWZ obtained a satellite image, seen at the top of this story, showing the Su-57 at Bandar Abbas, which lies on the Persian Gulf, on February 19 from Maxar Technologies. A pair of U.S.-made P-3 Orion maritime patrol planes, sold to Iran before the fall of the Shah in 1979, and a Russian-built Il-76 Candid cargo plane, are visible, as well. This aligns with a video, seen below, that has emerged that is said to show the Felon, which has the bort number Blue 054, at the Iranian base next to a Russian Il-76 with the registration RA-76373. That Candid was also in India as of February 18, according to online flight tracking data. Iran does operate Il-76s, as well.

Only the Orions are still visible there in a subsequent Planet image taken yesterday. A stock picture of Su-57 'Blue 054.' VCG/VCG via Getty Images Whether or not the Su-57 has now left Bandar Abbas or may just have been moved to another part of the base is unclear. Another video, seen below, is said to show the jet taking off at the Iranian base and has been making the rounds online since at least February 20. At the same time, there are unconfirmed claims circulating on social media that the Felon's stay in Iran was extended due to engine issues. The satellite imagery pointing to the jet still being there as of at least February 21 would lend some credence to those claims. Engine trouble has certainly been a recurring theme in the Su-57's history.

(@mhmiranusa) February 20, 2025 Russian military aircraft have made use of Iranian bases in the past, including as staging points for combat operations over Syria. Bandar Abbas is a logical intermediate point between Bengaluru in India where the Aero India 2025 show was held and Russia's current main Su-57 hub at Akhtubinsk Air Base in the southeastern end of the country. The Su-57's appearance in Iran does come amid new discussions about the jet's future on the open market with Algeria now having become the type's first export customer. This looks set to be an important shot in the arm for the Felon, which has been slow to enter Russia service, let alone attract foreign sales. Alegia's announcement came earlier this month around the Aero India 2025 show, where the jet also shared the ramp for the first time with a U.S. F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. A bilateral partnership between Russia and India on the Su-57 that began in the early 2000s had notably collapsed by 2018, as you can read more about here. Blue 054 and a U.S. F-35 Joint Strike Fighter seen together at Aero India 2025. PJSC United Aircraft Corporation/Anadolu via Getty Images There are no clear indications one way or the other that the Russians may have taken the current opportunity to more formally show off the Su-57 to Iranian officials at Bandar Abbas. There have been no reliable reports to date about active Iranian interest in acquiring the Felon. Even if Iran were to move to operate Su-57s, there would be immediate questions about its ability to operate and maintain the aircraft. The Felon is dramatically more complex than anything in Iran's current aging fighter inventory. Iran has said it is in the process of acquiring Russian Su-35 Flanker-Es, which would also represent a major boost in capability over its existing tactical jet fleets. That sale has been tied to Iranian assistance to Russia with regard to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, especially the sale of kamikaze drones and helping Moscow establish its capacity to produce them domestically. There is added emphasis now for Tehran to improve its air and missile defense capabilities and capacity after Israel struck multiple prized sites and key assets deep inside the country essentially with impunity in the past year. It is worth noting that it is unclear if Israeli aircraft ever entered Iran's airspace in the course of those operations. Whether or not Blue 054 is still at Bandar Abbas or if Su-57s start making more regular appearances in Iran, the stopover at the Iranian base does come at some of a new moment in the Felon's story.

B-52 Flies Close To Border Of Russia And Belarus	A U.S. Air Force B-52H Stratofortress bomber today flew over the Estonian capital, Tallinn, on a sortie that brought it within roughly 50 miles of the Russian border, according to online flight-tracking data. The B-52 had earlier appeared over Tallinn to mark Estonian Independence Day, the national day of the Baltic State, but broader geopolitical developments in the region put the flight in a different context. While over Tallinn, the strategic bomber joined a formation with four F-35A stealth fighters and a pair of F/A-18 Hornets. The F-35s were very likely Royal Netherlands Air Force examples that are currently conducting the Baltic Air Policing mission out of Ämari Air Base in Estonia. Meanwhile, the F/A-18s were from the Finnish Air Force.

It should be noted that overflights of Tallinn have happened before for Estonian Independence Day and have also previously involved B-52s. On the other hand, the signaling of this type of flight cannot be entirely overlooked, especially coming amid something of a reset in relations between the United States and Russia — and between Washington and NATO — since President Donald Trump took office. The B-52, from the 5th Bomb Wing from Minot Air Force Base, North Dakota, is one of two currently at RAF Fairford in England as part of a routine Bomber Task Force (BTF) deployment.

U.S. Air Force photo by Staff Sgt. Kristen Heller Staff Sgt. Kristen Heller Such deployments regularly involve missions in and around the Baltic Sea, an area of considerable importance, especially since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent East-West tensions. Earlier today, after flying over Tallinn, the B-52 continued in an eastward direction, heading toward Saint Petersburg. Based on publicly available data from online flight-tracking websites, the bomber came to within around 50 miles of the Russia-Estonia border before turning south. B-52 flight activity in and around Tallinn, Estonia, with the Russian border immediately to the east. flightradar24.com Continuing its return leg, the B-52 flew through Latvia and Lithuania, before crossing into Polish airspace, via the so-called Suwalki Gap. This brought the bomber to within around 10 miles of the Belarusian border, again based on online flight-tracking data. It’s worth noting that it’s not unheard of for U.S. bombers to pass through this area. The route taken by the B-52 through the Suwalki Gap. flightradar24.com screencap A wider view of the route taken by the B-52 today. flightradar24.com screencap The Suwalki Gap provides the shortest land route between Belarus and the heavily militarized Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, a distance of roughly 40 miles. As such, this has become a choke point and an area of great strategic and military importance to NATO and Russia. Were a conflict ever to break out in the region, Russian control of the Suwalki Gap would cut the three Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia off from the rest of the European Union and it would create a land bridge to Kaliningrad. A Lithuanian border guard monitors the video feed from cameras along the border to the Russian semi-exclave of Kaliningrad in Vistytis, Lithuania, within the strategically vital Suwalki Gap. Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images SeanGallup Again, the symbolic nature of a B-52 flight in these specific areas is hard to ignore. For the three Baltic States in particular, today’s B-52 sortie may be seen as a reminder of U.S. commitment to their continued independence in the face of an increasingly belligerent Russia. So far, the U.S. Department of Defense has not issued an official statement about the flight. However, in 2023, when a pair of B-52s also flew over Tallinn for Estonian Independence Day, U.S. Air Force Gen. James Hecker, commander of U.S. Air Forces in Europe-Air Forces Africa, and NATO Allied Air Command said: 'The United States and Estonia are close allies and share a strong partnership based on a common commitment to democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. We remain steadfastly committed to the freedom and sovereignty of Estonia and all our Baltic allies as we deter and defend against any threats to our shared security.' Such commitment is now in shorter supply, at least as far as the messaging from the Trump administration. In recent weeks, Trump has branded Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a 'dictator' and blamed Kyiv for starting the war with Russia. At the same time, there has been a sudden move to normalize relations between Washington and Moscow. For his part, Vance, speaking at the Munich Security Conference earlier this month, accused European leaders of suppressing free speech, failing to halt illegal migration, and betraying its 'most fundamental values.' U.S. Vice President JD Vance speaks during the 61st Munich Security Conference on February 14, 2025, in Munich, Germany. Photo by Johannes Simon/Getty Images Johannes Simon Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has said that the United States 'is no longer the primary guarantor of security in Europe.' These are words that will be of particular concern for the Baltic States, which rely to a huge extent on their NATO allies for defense. Traditionally, of course, NATO’s posture in Europe has been backed up by plausible nuclear deterrence — reinforced by the nuclear-capable B-52 and regular BTF deployments. Amid a general realignment of U.S. foreign policy priorities, and Washington’s changing expectations of NATO — that guarantee now looks rather more questionable. With that in mind, a show of force like the one conducted today carries some powerful signals not only for Russia, but also for the Baltic States and, more broadly, to other members of the NATO alliance who have no doubt been alarmed by recent messages from the Trump administration to Europe.

The strike happened nearly five months ago, but the war with Israel kept a full public funeral from happening. Israel also released footage of the bombardment of the bunker for the first time today. It is known that dozens of JDAMs with BLU-109/B warheads were used to devastate the subterranean facility.

Hezbollah's current Secretary General Naim Qassem addressed the public remotely during the funeral, vowing to follow Nasrallah’s example 'even if we are all killed.' Hezbollah has been deeply degraded by Israel's campaign against it, with much of its leadership being killed, thousands of its operatives wounded by sabotaged communications devices, and many of its fighters killed and its higher-end weapons destroyed during a protracted ground and air operation. The fall of Syria's strongman Bashar al-Assad also has had a major impact on the group's ability to rebuild its capabilities, both logistically and operationally. The loss of Assad also impacted Iran heavily, who used Syria to supply and support Hezbollah. A ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah was signed in November. IAF over Beirut International (IAF) IAF over Beirut (IAF) IAF fighters over the procession (IAF) The overtly ironic formation flyover — an act usually reserved for highly-honored military persons within a society — occurred at low altitude over Southern Beirut, which served as a reminder of Israel's total aerial supremacy over the area. This is especially true following the regime change in Syria, after which Israel struck all of Assad's known air defense capabilities. Russian air defenses in Syria, which reached out over a broad area, have also largely packed up and left. Still, such a flight profile is not without risk. Small arms fire or a sudden mechanical issue could leave few options flying that low and fast over a hostile area in broad daylight and during a time when your sworn enemies are already massed and rife with hatred. The flyover also came amid multiple airstrikes carried out by Israel on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon. Screenshot Today is Hassan Nasrallah’s funeral.

U.S.-Ukrainian Mineral Deal Getting Close To Fruition	Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky will soon sign a minerals agreement with the United States potentially worth hundreds of billions of dollars, White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said Friday. That move is part of U.S. President Donald Trump’s effort to end the war with Russia and a deal the American leader says will recoup billions in military aid provided to Kyiv. 'Here’s the bottom line: President Zelensky is going to sign that deal, and you will see that in the very short term,' Waltz said during remarks at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), according to The Guardian. Zelensky to sign US minerals deal soon, Waltz says.U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz said on Feb. 21 that President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to sign a minerals deal with the U.S. 'in the very short term,' the Guardian reported. 'President Zelensky is going to…&mdash; The Kyiv Independent (@KyivIndependent) February 21, 2025 During his evening address on Friday, Zelensky hinted that a deal could be close. 'Today, teams from Ukraine and the U.S. are working on a draft agreement between our governments,' he said. 'This is an agreement that can strengthen our relations, and the key is to work out the details to ensure its effectiveness. I look forward to the outcome – a just result.'

The exact terms could not be learned. Asked if this would go through, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office Friday: 'I think they want it. They feel good about it.' U.S. and Ukrainian officials negotiated all night into Friday morning to ink an agreement and end the souring Zelesnky-Trump relations, Axios reported, citing a U.S. official and a source with direct knowledge of the issue. Ukrainian, US officials negotiated throughout the night amid minerals deal dispute, Axios reports.Ukrainian and U.S. officials were at the table overnight and into the morning discussing an 'improved' bilateral rare earth mineral deal on Feb. 21, Axios reported.…&mdash; The Kyiv Independent (@KyivIndependent) February 21, 2025 The pending deal would give the U.S. access to Ukraine’s deposits of critical minerals including aluminum, gallium and titanium, Waltz said. As we previously reported, Ukraine possesses materials that are essential components of microchips and electric vehicle batteries and have significant military value. Trump has been touting this as a way to reduce the burden for supporting Ukraine, with Waltz claiming US aid to Kyiv has exceeded $175 billion, The Guardian reported. That figure, as we have explained before, contradicts information compiled by the Kiel Institute For The World Economy’s Ukraine Support Tracker, which shows that the U.S. has provided Ukraine with a little less than $120 billion from the U.S. More than half – $66.5 billion – was for direct security assistance in the form of donated weapons, according to Pentagon figures. Data compiled by the Kiel Institute shows Europe outpaced the U.S. in aid to Ukraine. (Kiel Institute) Last week, the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, presented Zelensky with the draft proposal for that plan, with Ukraine providing approximately $500 billion worth of rare earth elements to the U.S., The Guardian explained. There were claims that Bessent told the Ukrainian president to sign the deal on the spot, but we can't confirm that. News about the looming mineral deal came as the war of words between Trump and Zelensky continues to escalate in the wake of peace talks in Saudi Arabia between the U.S. and Moscow that did not include Ukraine. In comments to Fox News radio host Brian Kilmeade on Friday, Trump blasted Zelensky as a poor negotiator, and called Bessent’s trip 'dangerous' and 'a waste of time.' The pair 'couldn't even come close' to a deal, Trump told Kilmeade. Ukrainian officials, however, said that they had only a few hours to study it before it was presented to them. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he was 'very upset' with Zelensky over the deal, claiming the Ukrainian leader misrepresented the outcome of a meeting he had with Rubio and Vice President J.D. Vance. Zelensky said he wanted to make the deal but needed the approval of his legislature, Rubio said. However, 'I read two days later that Zelensky is out there saying ‘I rejected the deal. I told him, No way that we're not doing that.’ Well, that's not what happened in that meeting,' Rubio explained. 'So you start to get upset by something. We're trying to help these guys.' Trump: Zelensky had the most beautiful cities, and now they’re all destroyed.Host: But that’s Putin’s fault, wouldn’t you agree?Trump: I’m tired of hearing that, I’ll tell you that much.Host: Isn’t Putin to blame?Trump: *ignores the question* pic.twitter.com/LjWaMzOVBJ&mdash; Clash Report (@clashreport) February 21, 2025 As we previously noted, it’s one thing to strike a deal, but something else entirely to extract and process the resources. A little more than half of Ukraine’s mineral resources are contained in the four regions Russian President Vladimir Putin annexed in September 2022, and of which his army occupies a considerable swathe, The Independent reported earlier this month. That includes Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, though Kherson holds little value in terms of minerals, the publication added. The Crimean peninsula, annexed and occupied by Russian forces in 2014, also holds billions in mineral wealth, The Independent added. Regardless of the difficulty though, it seems that both sides see value in a mineral deal. Signing it could go a long way to cooling the tensions between Trump and Zelensky that have erupted over the past week. The Latest On the battlefield, the bulk of the fighting continues to rage in eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk region, but despite strong Russian pressure, its forces are making few advances. Here are the key takeaways from the latest Institute for the Study of War (ISW) assessment. Kursk: Russian forces continued offensive operations in Kursk Oblast on February 20 but did not make any confirmed advances. Kherson: Russian forces continued ground attacks in the Kharkiv direction on February 20 but did not advance.

'I think the Russians want to see the war end, I really do. I think they have the cards a little bit, because they've taken a lot of territory. They have the cards,' Trump told the BBC on Air Force One. When asked if he trusts that Russia wants peace, Trump said 'I do.' Trump says Russia 'have the cards' in peace negotiations BBC News (World) (@BBCWorld) February 20, 2025 Russia used the first round of the recently concluded negotiations with the U.S. over ending the war in Ukraine to demand the withdrawal of NATO forces from the alliance’s eastern flank, the Financial Times reported. That triggered concern in European capitals that the Trump administration 'could acquiesce to seal a peace deal,' the publication suggested. The Romanian president’s chief of staff and adviser for defense and national security said while the U.S. delegation had rejected Moscow’s demand, there were no guarantees that Washington would not eventually make this concession to Vladimir Putin. ''As far as I understand, the situation can change from hour to hour or from day to day,''' Cristian Diaconescu told Antena3 television,' FT noted. Diaconescu was referring to Trump’s scathing criticism of Zelensky as well as the American leader's 'concessions made to Russia even before talks began,' according to FT. Diaconescu 'stressed that the Russian delegation to the talks in Riyadh earlier this week 'failed to convince the Americans' on a NATO withdrawal and that further visits by the leaders of the UK and France to Washington next week would seek to persuade Trump not to give in to this demand,' FT wrote. There is a growing list of U.S. legislators objecting to Trump’s harsh comments about Zelensky, including calling the Ukrainian leader a 'dictator.' Several Republican Senators broke ranks with the president about that assessment, including Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, and John Thune of South Dakota. 'I would certainly never refer to President Zelensky as a dictator,' Murkowski told reporters. 'It is quite clear who started the war. It was absolutely Russia at Putin's directive.'

Thom Tillis (R-NC), another staunch Trump supporter, also questioned Trump's support for Putin. 'I believe his instincts are pretty good,' Tillis said of Trump. 'But what I'm telling you, whoever believes that there is any space for Vladimir Putin in the future of a stable globe, better go to Ukraine. They better go to Europe. They better invest the time to understand that this man is a cancer, and the greatest threat to democracy in my lifetime.'

The plan calls for fewer than 30,000 troops 'deployed to Ukrainian cities, ports and other critical infrastructure sites, such as nuclear power stations, far away from the current front lines,' the publication reported. Starmer will reportedly urge Trump 'to have U.S. fighter jets and missiles on standby in Eastern Europe to respond with lethal force if Russia breaks the terms of any armistice,' The Telegraph noted, citing 'Western officials briefed on the plans.' 'Rather than stationing a much bigger force in the war-torn country, the mission will rely on ‘technical monitoring,’ including intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft, drones and satellites to provide a ‘complete picture of what is going on,' The Telegraph stated, citing a Western official. 'The operation would be backed up by enough firepower to ‘monitor and shoot those attacks down,’' to reopen Ukraine’s airspace and enable commercial flights, the source added. Naval patrol vessels would also be sent to the Black Sea to monitor Russian threats to commercial shipping routes.

The move comes out of concern that the U.S. will 'no longer protect Europe via NATO,' the publication noted. 'We are entering a time when we will have to ... reinvest even more, French and European, to strengthen our defense and our security,' Macron said, adding that he did not know 'if 5% is the right figure for France, but in any case, we will have to go up.'

French Aid to Ukraine (@aidefranceukr) February 20, 2025 EU countries are preparing a military aid package worth at least €6 billion ($6.3 billion) for Ukraine, Politico reported, citing three EU diplomats. That aid was being gathered 'to shore up Kyiv's strategic position at the outset of U.S.-led talks with Russia, the news outlet explained. The package, which should include everything from 1.5 million artillery shells to air defense systems, 'would mark one of the EU's largest military aid packages since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022 and could be unveiled ahead of a highly symbolic visit by European commissioners to Kyiv on Feb. 24,' Politico noted. Two of the diplomats said the package could be 'increased to up to €10 billion ($10.5 billion) or more as countries dig into their inventories to see what they can send to Ukraine,' Politico posited.

In addition, despite Putin’s efforts to paint the Russian economy as robust, inflation in that country has been rising due to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, 'Russia primarily recruits volunteer soldiers through large individual payments and has had to increase payments significantly to sustain recruitment. Russian lenders show signs of uncertainty about Russia's economic future and the solvency of Kremlin coffers,' ISW stated. 'Putin’s protracted war in Ukraine is destroying Russia’s national wealth through the steady erosion of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund and growing inflation. The Kremlin has been trying in recent months to reduce state spending on benefits to military personnel, indicating that the Kremlin is aware that it cannot continue such high spending and must find ways to cut costs.' These factors are contributing to Russia's current force generation apparatus appearing to be 'unable to recruit the manpower that the Russian military needs to sustain Russia's current rate of offensive operations.' ISW posited. To convince the Russian populous not to worry, the Kremlin 'has been engaged in an information campaign in recent months that aims to posture the Russian economy as strong and stable to both domestic and international audiences, and the state of Russia's economy is likely more strained than Kremlin officials publicly acknowledge,' ISW suggested. 3/ The Kremlin has been engaged in an information campaign in recent months that aims to posture the Russian economy as strong and stable to both domestic and international audiences, and the state of Russia's economy is likely more strained than Kremlin officials publicly… pic.twitter.com/VBlkrFITBI&mdash; Institute for the Study of War (@TheStudyofWar) February 20, 2025 Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk 'has called on the European Union to confiscate the assets of the Russian Central Bank, which are frozen due to sanctions, to finance future financial support for Ukraine,' Euronews reported. 'So far, the bloc has only used the extraordinary revenues of the assets held in its territory, estimated to be worth €210 billion (about $220 billion), to deliver financial and military assistance to the war-torn nation,' the publication reported.

A new study by RUSI shows just how effective they’ve been, causing the majority of damage to Russian equipment of any weapon in Ukraine’s arsenal. That's despite challenges presented by electronic warfare (EW), weather and interference caused by multiple drones operating in the same area. 'Tactical UAVs have significant limitations,' the report states. 'Between 60% and 80% of Ukrainian [first-person view] FPVs fail to reach their target, depending on the part of the front and the skill of the operators. Of those that do strike their targets, a majority fail to destroy the target system when striking armored vehicles.' The success rate in wounding infantry is high, the report notes. 'Furthermore, there are long periods where either EW or the weather significantly degrades UAV operations. With FPVs that are remotely piloted by radio frequency, it is also difficult to concentrate multiple drones in time and space because they can interfere with one another’s guidance systems,' the report continues. 'Despite these limitations, tactical UAVs currently account for 60%–70% of damaged and destroyed Russian systems,' RUSI found. 'A key finding is that tactical drones are inflicting roughly two-thirds of Russian losses…twice as effective as every other weapon in the Ukr arsenal put together…remarkable…for weapons which did not officially exist in the Ukr mil at start of the war' Shashank Joshi (@shashj) February 20, 2025 To help defend against Ukrainian drone attacks, some Russian troops are kitted out with backpack-style electronic warfare countermeasures bristling with antennae and hooked into a portable power supply.

Earlier this month, we told you about a mile-long mesh net 'tunnel' Russian forces were using to protect convoys against onslaughts of Ukrainian’s first-person view drones. Ukrainians, however, found a quick workaround. Just destroy the netting. 'This may involve using drones equipped with flammable thermal mixtures or deploying other types of drones to destroy the net—such as heavy bombers—before engaging with classic FPV drones,' Michael, the commander of Ukraine’s Typhoon drone unit, recently told Forbes.

However, as the war progressed, drones became a greater danger and both sides added extra armor and often massive so-called cope cages to protect against them. But as the following video shows, the Javelins remain a menace, one that this Russian tank's huge cage couldn't defeat.

North Korean troops deployed to Russia are adapting quickly, gaining firsthand experience in modern warfare with Russian military support—an alarming development that could reshape security dynamics in East Asia, Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov told the Chosun Daily. 'This war has mobilized the full military capabilities of the nations involved. Only three countries—Ukraine, Russia, and North Korea—are gaining direct experience in full-scale 21st-century warfare. The North Korean military of the future will be fundamentally different from its past,' Budanov explained. He cited the KN-23 missile that North Korea supplied to Russia as an example. 'Initially, its accuracy was severely flawed, with an error margin of 500 to 1,500 meters,' he said. 'But Russian missile experts made technical modifications, resolving the issue. The missile is now significantly more precise and a far greater threat.' He warned that this technological advancement could have serious security implications for South Korea and Japan, both of which are within North Korea’s missile range. 'North Korea is using this war to gain combat experience and modernize its military technology,' Budanov said. 'This will have lasting consequences for the security landscape in the Asia-Pacific region.'

Drone-Equipped U.S. Marines Now Helping Protect Baltic Se Submari...	About 40 drone-equipped U.S. Marines have been sent to Finland to join NATO’s Baltic Sentry effort to protect undersea cables in the wake of several instances of suspected sabotage, according to the Finnish Defense Ministry (MoD) and U.S. Marine Corps. That news comes as Swedish Police say they are investigating a potential new break in a cable running between Gotland and Germany, the latest in a series of such incidents. While U.S. Marines routinely train with Finnish forces and U.S. Navy P-8 surveillance aircraft have already participated in Baltic Sentry, this marks the first commitment of American troops. Baltic Sentry was stood up last month by 10 NATO nations in the wake of the suspected sabotage in December of undersea power and communications cables between Finland and Estonia.

Shane Beaubien The Marines will use hand-launched RQ-20 Puma surveillance drones to 'provide additional maritime domain awareness' to Baltic Sentry, according to the Marine Corps. The Pumas 'are capable of being operated from sea and land, but their employment will be determined by the Finnish and Marine Corps team on the ground,' Lt. Col. Zach Leuthardt, a spokesman for U.S. Marine Corps Forces Europe, told us. U.S. Marine Corps Cpl.

(U.S. Marine Corps photo by Lance Cpl. Sydni Jessee) Lance Cpl. Sydni Jessee The Marine platoon 'will help create the recognized maritime picture and monitor critical undersea infrastructure in the Gulf of Finland by identifying and tracking vessel movements together with the Finnish Navy,' the Finnish MoD said in a statement. The Recognized Maritime picture 'is created based on multiple different sensors and the analysis formed from this data,' the Finnish MoD told us. 'The USMC platoon will use capabilities such as UAVs that can supplement the current Recognized Maritime picture. In other words, they are one node in the network that collects movement of the ships in the Baltic Sea. Sensors that USMC uses are not armed and thus there is no need for specific Rules of Engagement.' 'Having the US Marine Corps unit in Finland and as part of NATO’s Baltic Sentry will strengthen the security of Finland and the Baltic Sea region.' Finnish Defense Minister Antti Häkkänen said in a statement. 'This cooperation is a continuation of our active international exercises with our Allies.' The Marines arrived this week and the length of their deployment has not yet been determined, the Finnish MoD told us. They came to Europe 'to train as part of Marine Rotational Force Europe and were dynamically re-tasked to support Baltic Sentry,' Luethardt explained, adding that they are well-suited for this mission. 'The Marine Corps’ ability to be an expeditionary and agile force, with expertise in littoral environments, makes us a logical partner for this type of enhanced vigilance activity,' Leuthardt noted. 'This is another milestone in our long-standing collaborative relationship with Finland and NATO. This mission will set conditions for European allies to bolster their NATO contributions and capabilities.' U.S. Marines undergoing training with Finnish troops. (NATO) The deployment is mutually beneficial, a spokesman Gen. Christopher G. Cavoli, the Supreme Allied Commander Europe of NATO (SACEUR), told The War Zone Friday morning. 'This is a great opportunity for the two countries to work together, and with other Allies, on an important issue for both America and Europe - the protection of critical undersea infrastructure,' Army Col. Martin O’Donnell said. 'This is also a great opportunity for the Marines to hone their cold weather skills. The Arctic is a focus of NATO and the U.S. and anytime we partner with a country like Finland, it is a good thing for the Marines, America and the Finns.' Having Marines deployed on this mission fits into their new doctrine of positioning small units in littoral areas inside an enemy's weapons engagement zone (WEZ), though that has been largely focused on the Pacific. 'Being forward inside the weapons engagement zone, with allies and partners, reassuring them every day, by walking the real estate with them, that is deterrence,' Marine Corps Lt. Gen. Karsten Heckl told a virtual panel held by the Center for International and Strategic Studies in 2022. A Marine Javelin team operates from a small inflatable rubber boat during Exercise Castaway 21.1. (USMC) Highlighting the need for this cooperation, the Swedish Police on Friday announced that they are investigating 'a possible cable break in the Baltic Sea…within the Swedish economic zone. The preliminary investigation into suspected sabotage was opened so that the police can have access to the tools needed to clarify what happened and whether it is a new or old damage.' There are no suspects yet, the police stated, adding that they are 'cooperating with the relevant authorities and have no further information to share at this time.' 'We take all reports of possible damage to infrastructure in the Baltic Sea very seriously,' Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said Friday on X. 'As I said earlier, they must be seen in the context of the serious security situation that exists.' Jag har sedan en tid kännedom om uppgifterna i media om ett eventuellt nytt kabelbrott i Östersjön. Regeringen informeras löpande av berörda myndigheter som undersöker vad som skett. Vi tar alla uppgifter om eventuella skador på infrastruktur i Östersjön på största allvar. Som…&mdash; SwedishPM (@SwedishPM) February 21, 2025 'We (Allied Maritime Command and SHAPE) are also in touch with Sweden on reports of a new cable break in the Baltic Sea,' SACUER spokesman O’Donnell told us. 'Sweden’s Coast Guard was informed of the purported break yesterday and is investigating.' There have been several instances of suspected sabotage of undersea cables, with Russia and China as the prime suspects. According to Finnish authorities, the Russian-linked Eagle S oil tanker severed the Estlink 2 undersea power cable and four telecommunications cables with its anchor in December. The ship, found to be brimming with spy equipment, was seized and authorities are continuing their investigation. You can see that ship after it was seized by Finnish authorities in the following video. In November, Germany said damage to two communication cables running under the Baltic Sea was most likely the result of sabotage. The two cables in question are both fiber-optic communication cables, running along the Baltic seabed. One runs between the Swedish island of Gotland and Lithuania, and the other between Finland and Germany. Gotland is about 280 miles southwest of where the Estlink 2 cable was severed. A day later, Denmark confirmed it was monitoring a Chinese cargo vessel at the center of allegations surrounding that damage. The 735-foot-long Yi Peng 3 was identified as operating near the cables when the incidents occurred. The Chinese vessel had departed the Russian port of Ust-Luga, in the Leningrad region, close to the Estonian border, on Nov. 15 and had been scheduled to sail to Port Said, Egypt, where it was originally due to arrive on Dec. 3. Last month, Swedish Defense Minister Carl-Oskar Bohlin announced that the Norbalt undersea power cable linking Sweden with Lithuania was likely also purposely damaged by the Yi Peng 3 as well. Officials suspect the Yi Peng 3 of severing at least three cables running underneath the Baltic Sea. (Photo by Mikkel Berg Pedersen / Ritzau Scanpix / AFP) / Denmark) The deployment of the Marines to Baltic Sentry comes against the backdrop of the ongoing war in Ukraine, which will mark its third anniversary on Monday. It is part of a greater effort by NATO to establish a more ready force in the face of potential Russian aggression. '&#8230;we will have a rigorous exercise program to enhance our readiness,' Cavoli, the SACEUR, said during a NATO press conference last month. 'Allied Command Operations has nearly 100 separate exercises planned in 2025.' At that press conference, Cavoli stressed there would be limited U.S. involvement in Baltic Sentry, a sign that NATO is more than just an American operation. 'There's not a single U.S contribution to that,' he said at the time. 'I think I'm the only U.S. contribution to it, in fact. So this is an alliance that is not a one-trick pony. This is an alliance that is capable of doing things and is rapidly gaining the ability to do more and more.' This was before the Navy’s P-8s flew surveillance missions and the Marines were sent in. Whether there will be additional U.S. contributions to Baltic Sentry remains to be seen. 'We don’t speculate about future operations, but would reemphasize what NATO leaders have said in that Baltic Sentry is primarily about regional allies helping regional Allies,' Arlo Abrahamson, a NATO spokesman, told us.

China’s Sudden Live Fire Naval Drills Off Australia Rattle Canber...	A rare Chinese naval drill with a previously unannounced live-fire component has disrupted air traffic over and around the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand. Authorities in Australia say they only learned that the Chinese ships would be firing some of their weapons after the crews of commercial airliners flying overhead received alerts. In addition to the signals this particular incident sends, the general presence of the flotilla in the region underscores the increasing reach of a steadily larger and more capable People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) beyond China's own shores. The PLAN's Type 055 destroyer Zunyi, Type 054A frigate Hengyang, and Type 903 replenishment ship Weishanhu have been sailing south in international waters to the east of Australia since at least last week. Often referred to as a cruiser given its size, the Type 055 is one of the most modern and capable warships in Chinese service today. Elements of the Australian and New Zealand armed forces, including warships and P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol planes, have been shadowing their movements. A picture Australian authorities previously released of the Type 054A frigate Hengyang sailing waters to the east of the country. Australian Defense Force 'We weren't notified by China, we became aware of the issue during the course of the day,' Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles said while speaking to ABC Radio Perth earlier today. 'What China did was put out a notification that it was intending to engage in live fire, and by that I mean a broadcast that was picked up by airlines, literally commercial planes that were flying across the Tasman.' 'I can understand why this was probably … very disconcerting for the airlines,' Marles added, stressing that Australia typically gives 12 to 24 hours notice ahead of live-fire exercises. Based on information in alerts shared via the international Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS), the Chinese drills occurred in an area roughly 400 miles (340 nautical miles) to the southeast of the Australian city of Sydney. An Emirates flight heading from Sydney in Australia to New Zealand's Christchurch was reportedly directly hailed by the Chinese flotilla warning the aircraft to stay at least 19 nautical miles away from where they were operating. Qantas and Air New Zealand have now made changes to the routes their planes take over and around the Tasman Sea, and other airlines have reportedly done the same. Civilian aviation authorities in Australia have now issued formal 'advice' regarding air traffic around where the Chinese ships are operating.

'The ABC understands the Chinese vessels were seen deploying a floating target, changing formation and then resetting formation consistent with a live fire event,' according to that outlet. 'However, it is understood the Australian military did not observe the vessels firing on the target.' Inflatable floating targets, typically red or bright orange in color, and often referred to as 'killer tomatoes' as a result, are routinely used in maritime training exercises, especially live-fire gunnery drills, by armed forces around the world. Chinese sailors drop a 'killer tomato' target off the side of a ship during training in the South China Sea. China Military Online Whether the Chinese ships will conduct additional live-fire drills while they are in the Tasman Sea or elsewhere in the region is unknown. 'This is activity that has occurred in waters consistent with international law,' Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has said. 'There has been no imminent risk of danger to any Australian assets or New Zealand assets.' 'The [People's Liberation Army] Southern Theatre Command organized the Chinese fleet to conduct a far seas exercise,' Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry, said, according to ABC. 'The drill was carried out in a safe, standard, and professional manner in accordance with the relevant international law and international practice.' At the same time, the Chinese flotilla's actions today, as well as its general presence in the region, are clearly at best atypical. Prime Minister Albanese has already drawn criticism within Australia for his muted response. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, at the podium, and, to his left, Richard Marles, now Australia's Defense Minister, at a press conference in 2022. David Gray/Getty Images DAVID GRAY 'There is no doubt that this is, not unprecedented, but an unusual event,' Australian Defense Minister Marles had also told Sky News television yesterday just about the arrival of the Chinese ships in waters to the east of Australia. 'We have not been informed by the Chinese government why this task group has been deployed into our region, and we have not been informed what its future plans are,' New Zealand Defense Minister Judith Collins had said in a separate statement yesterday. Especially now with the disruptive live-firing that was not announced in advance, it is hard not to see the Chinese flotilla's operations as being intended to send a message at least to Australia, if not well beyond. Just five days ago, Australian and Chinese military officials held a high-level strategic dialogue in Beijing, the 23rd such engagement the two countries have held, but the first since 2019. 'At today’s Dialogue, both countries exchanged views on bilateral, global, and regional security issues, as well as military transparency and communication,' Australia's Department of Defense said in a statement after the February 17 gathering. 'Australia reiterated the importance of all countries in the region operating in a safe and professional manner at all times to avoid the risk of miscalculation or escalation.' There has been a general trend of increasingly assertive Chinese naval activity around Australia in recent years. For instance, in 2022, Australian authorities accused a Chinese warship sailing in waters to the north of Australia of harassing one of its P-8A aircraft with a laser. Chinese intelligence-gathering ships have become an increasingly common sight in international waters off Australia coasts, as well. A Royal Australian Air Force P-8A Poseidon. Australian Department of Defense There has been a similar trend in more aggressive Chinese military interactions with foreign warships and aircraft, especially in and around the hotly disputed South China Sea. Just earlier this month, a Chinese fighter jet dropped flares in front of another Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) P-8A flying over the South China China Sea in what officials in Australia described as an 'unsafe and unprofessional interaction.' Chinese state media has since released footage of this incident, as seen below. In a documentary, China released a real footage of PLA J16 intercepting Australian P-8A Poseidon by releasing IR decoy flare. pic.twitter.com/x8h0C9ESZX&mdash; Li Zexin (@XH_Lee23) September 13, 2024 All of this also comes as Australia has been working to modernize and otherwise bolster its naval capabilities with a clear eye toward being better able to challenge China in the Pacific. The most prominent effort in this regard is the Royal Australian Navy's planned acquisition of a nuclear-powered submarine force with the assistance of its American and British allies. This is part of the larger trilateral Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS) defense cooperation agreement. The U.S. military's own forward-deployed air and naval presence in Australia is also set to grow significantly. For its part, China's military has steadily working to expand its ability to project naval and air power further and further away from its shores in all directions in the Pacific, as well as elsewhere globally. This includes a significant uptick in Chinese activity in the waters and skies around the U.S. state of Alaska, which has also often been conducted in direct cooperation with Russian forces. Chinese H-6 missile carrier aircraft notably made their first-ever appearance off Alaska last year as part of a joint patrol with Russian Tu-95 Bear bombers. How long the Chinese flotilla in the Tasman Sea will stay there and whether it will conduct more live-fire drills remain to be seen. The ships have already sent clear signals and their actions so far could be a sign of things to come well beyond this particular deployment.

X-37B Spaceplane Shares Earth Image For First Time As New Mission...	For the first time, the U.S. Space Force has released a photo of Earth taken by one of its secretive X-37B mini-shuttles. The image appears to be the first in-orbit shot from the craft of any kind to be officially released by the Pentagon. However, a brief video clip published in 2023 did show the service-module-equipped X-37B separating from its launch rocket after being lofted into space in 2020. Earth, seen from the perspective of the X-37B’s onboard camera, during its ongoing seventh mission. U.S. Space Force Courtesy Photo Master Sgt. Gustavo Castillo The new photo, published by the Defense Visual Information Distribution Service (DVIDS) yesterday, shows Earth captured by an X-37B’s onboard camera, during its seventh mission, sometime last year. The image was taken 'while conducting experiments in a highly elliptical orbit,' and the camera itself is primarily used to 'ensure the health and safety of the vehicle,' the Space Force says. The caption notes that the X-37B’s seventh mission included, for the first time, a series of aerobraking maneuvers, used to change its orbit using minimal fuel. The X-37B used on the OTV-6 mission on the flight line at the Kennedy Space Center after its return to Earth on November 12, 2022. U.S. Air Force The seventh X-37B mission, known as OTV-7, launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on December 28, 2023. The X-37B is still in orbit now, having passed 400 days in orbit on January 31 this year. You can find out more about the mission in TWZ’s previous reporting. In general, the Boeing-built X-37B has been incredibly camera-shy. Before the photo published yesterday, and the video clip from 2023, the U.S. Space Force and Boeing only released the first pictures of the service module — including ones showing the U.S. Air Force Academy’s FalconSat-8, a small cubesat, and other payloads loaded onto it — after the conclusion of the OTV-6 mission in 2022. A SpaceX video montage that includes a clip of the X-37B separating into space. The montage begins at approximately 3:38 in the runtime: Watch Falcon Heavy launch the USSF-52 mission to orbit SpaceX (@SpaceX) December 29, 2023 Boeing also previously released footage of an X-37B without the service module separating from its launch rocket during the OTV-1 mission, which began on April 22, 2010, and ended on December 3 of that year. This level of secrecy is hardly surprising given that the X-37Bs and their missions remain highly classified. This, in turn, has led to much speculation about their functions, including their potential use as space-based intelligence, reconnaissance, and surveillance (ISR) or weapons platforms. TWZ has discussed what is known about these spaceplanes and their capabilities in depth in the past. As for OTV-7, some details about the mission have gradually emerged, adding to what we already knew about it when it began. The launch, also known as USSF-52, used a Falcon Heavy rocket for the first time, meaning that the X-37B could be placed in a much higher orbit than on previous missions, as TWZ previously explored.

Orbits that take spacecraft beyond the GEO belt — which is defined as being around 22,236 miles (35,786 kilometers) above sea level — are categorized as high-Earth orbits (HEO). A graphic depicting the major different orbits around our planet, from low-Earth orbit (LEO), via medium-Earth orbit (MEO), to geostationary orbit (GEO). Sedrubal via Wikimedia Commons Furthermore, OTV-7 involves taking the X-37B for the first time on a highly elliptical orbit (confusingly, also known as HEO). In the past, former Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson referred to the X-37B’s ability to operate on a highly elliptical orbit, an egg-shaped trajectory that allows it to maneuver itself once it’s close enough to the atmosphere. The advantage of this is that it allows the spaceplane to reappear unexpectedly in orbit, making it harder for any potential adversaries to track. A video shows a notional trajectory of the X-37B in a highly elliptical orbit: 'We know that that drives them nuts, and I’m really glad about that,' Wilson said, back in 2019. A key aspect of the X-37B is that it is highly maneuverable and the spaceplanes have been observed changing their positions during previous missions. The Space Force had previously said that OTV-7 would include 'experimenting with future space domain awareness technologies, and investigating the radiation effects on materials provided by NASA.' As far as payloads for OTV-7 are concerned, the Space Force has so far only revealed that the X-37B is carrying NASA’s Seeds-2 experiment, which will explore what happens to plant seeds exposed to 'the harsh radiation environment of long-duration spaceflight.' We now know a little more about some of the various aspects of the mission, including that Boeing developed a new collision avoidance system ahead of OTV-7. For the current mission, the Space Force has identified about '1.7 million collision avoidance opportunities,' Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman told Aviation Week in a recent interview, referring to the threat posed by the proliferation of manmade objects in space. Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman, the senior uniformed officer heading the Space Force. U.S. Air Force photo by Andy Morataya The aforementioned aerobraking maneuver is another key aspect of OTV-7. According to Aviation Week, the X-37B vehicle needed some modifications, covering 'fault protection, autonomy, and collision avoidance' to make it capable of this maneuver. This involves the spaceplane using the drag of the atmosphere to dip into low-Earth orbit (LEO), during which it can separate from its service module. You can read more about the aerobraking maneuver in the context of the X-37B in this previous story. The X-37B used for the OTV-6 mission seen ahead of its launch in 2020 with the service module attached to its tail-end. This picture was released in November 2022 after OTV-6’s conclusion. U.S. Space Force Saltzman told the same publication that the aerobraking maneuver was also used to evaluate the Space Force’s Space Surveillance Network, a collection of optical and radar sensors used to detect, track, identify, and catalog all human-made objects in orbit. Finally, OTV-7 has been exploring autonomy, seen as vital as space becomes increasingly busy, especially since spaceplanes like the X-37B operate in various regimes. Saltzman also said in the interview that there were no plans to use the X-37B as an operational vehicle, but it’s clearly being used to gather data that will inform both potential future U.S. spaceplanes and also gain a better understanding of how adversaries could use similar systems. Most notably, China has been busy testing a spaceplane, named Shenlong (meaning Divine Dragon), which is understood to be broadly comparable to the X-37B. Unofficial concept artwork of the Chinese spaceplane, named Shenlong (meaning Divine Dragon). via Chinese Internet Some other details about the X-37B were recently provided to Aviation Week by Boeing’s Michelle Parker, company vice president for space mission systems. She confirmed that the company has been conducting continual upgrades on the X-37B, including introducing new types of batteries and solar cells. 'Even though it may look the same, a lot of the innards have been upgraded and then can continue to fly for a significant amount of time,' Parker told the magazine. While we may still be being drip-fed new information about the X-37B, the fact that more is being disclosed may well reflect calls from U.S. officials and members of Congress to reveal more regarding military activity in and related to space. The X-37B used in OTV-6 sits at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center. U.S. Air Force photo by Staff Sgt. Adam Shank With the X-37Bs now assigned to the Space Force’s main unit tasked with 'orbital warfare,' their military role is now made explicit. Meanwhile, more efforts have also been made to try and communicate to the public about the importance of space to military operations (and daily life) and potential threats outside of the Earth’s atmosphere, as well as what the U.S. government is doing about those issues. Bearing in mind the activities of near-peer adversaries like China or Russia, space is now indisputably a key military domain and potential battlefield in future conflicts. In particular, the ability of China and Russia to threaten U.S. and allied activities in space via various anti-satellite weapons is a growing area of concern. Currently, it’s unclear to what degree the new Trump administration might change how sensitive U.S. military space missions might be communicated to the public. However, the release of a photo showing — for the first time — the Earth seen from an X-37B is certainly a welcome glimpse into the still-secretive world of these hard-working spaceplanes.

New Hypersonic Strike-Recon Aircraft Effort Eyeing Prototype Deve...	The U.S. Air Force, in cooperation with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), is still exploring concepts for a reusable hypersonic air vehicle capable of performing strike and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Work being done now could lead to the start of the development of a flying Next Generation Responsive Strike (Next RS) prototype or demonstrator within the next five years. A secretive Air Force program called Mayhem with very similar stated objectives had become mired in uncertainty last year, including over whether there was even demand for a capability of this kind. The Next RS concept has emerged quietly over the past year or so in multiple DARPA contracting notices seeking proposals to meet various relevant technological needs. Aviation Week was first to report on the effort earlier this month. '[DARPA's] Aerospace Projects Office (APO), working in close partnership with [the] Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), develops and demonstrates technologies which enable Next Generation Responsive Strike (Next RS) air platforms,' one DARPA contracting notice put out on February 5 says. 'APO envisions reusable hypersonic aircraft attributes providing future multi-mission strike/ISR capabilities against targets protected by advanced air defense systems. APO is seeking innovative technologies that close the gap between the state-of-the-art in reusable hypersonics and the level of technical maturity required to initiate a NextRS Y-Plane design and development program later this decade.' A rendering of a notional hypersonic air vehicle. GE The notice lists six technological areas of interest that APO sees as key to advancing the Next RS concept: structures and materials, high-speed weapon separation, dual-mode propulsion, power generation, thermal management systems, and a high-Mach turbine engine. When it comes to dual-mode propulsion, APO is specifically looking at 'technologies that allow continuous powered operation of a Turbine Based Combined Cycle (TBCC) propulsion system over the entire flight envelope.' Advanced high-Mach turbine engine technology will also 'allow efficient TBCC operations through ascending and descending mode transition without the need for water injection.' 'DARPA seeks a better understanding of High Mach Gas Turbine (HMGT) developments to date and what technologies are needed to advance such an engine to the preliminary design level,' a separate Next RS-related contracting notice posted online in April 2024 adds. 'If this engine is going to be developed in the near term, DARPA also believes an existing core is needed as the heart of such an engine development program.' The April 2024 notice, which also highlights DARPA's work already on TBCC propulsion through the past Advanced Full Range Engine (AFRE) program, lays out a notional requirement for an HMGT capable of producing 30,000 to 38,000 pounds of continuous thrust. Other projected performance specifications are classified. A practical TBCC propulsion system has long been viewed as a something of a holy grail for very high-speed aircraft design. Ramjets and scramjets typically used to propel air-breathing air vehicles to hypersonic speeds, typically defined as anything about Mach 5, do not work properly at subsonic speeds and can have trouble operating efficiently even at low-supersonic speeds. As such, a significant initial boost velocity, usually provided by a rocket motor, is required before those engines can kick in. A TBCC combines ramjets/scramjets with jet turbines that work at lower speeds, and offers the ability to seamlessly shift from one mode to the other. An air vehicle with a TBCC propulsion system would be able to take off and land from suitably long existing runways, but cruise at high-supersonic or even hypersonic speeds, offering immense operational flexibility. A graphical depiction of a notional turbine-based combined cycle engine arrangement. Lockheed Martin The explicit mention in DARPA's February 5 contracting notice of 'technologies that allow weapons, weapon bays and ejection systems to accommodate hypersonic separation from aircraft and flyout to the target' is also worth discussing. Any air vehicle flying at hypersonic speed is subjected to immense physical and thermal stresses. Designing a payload bay that can safely open and release something under those conditions presents significant additional challenges. Whatever payload might be released would also be moving at hypersonic speeds, at least initially, and need to be able to withstand those stresses. The development of bespoke munitions would likely be required for an operational Next RS platform. 'The recent development of hypersonic weapons, whether scramjet based or boost-glide based systems, brought with it a resurgence in structural concepts and material development that could survive the hypersonic environment and weapon-like life cycles and timelines,' another contracting notice related to Next RS put out in April 2024 says, adding further context to the substantial materials science and engineering requirements. 'Advances in thermal protection systems, 'hot' structures and additively manufactured structures accompanied these development efforts. Likewise, research in composite materials such as carbon-carbon, infused carbon-carbon or ceramic matrix composites has followed.' 'These structural and material advances for hypersonic weapons are a necessary but not sufficient step towards enabling hypersonic aircraft structures which need to be reusable over larger operational timelines, weight efficient over large surfaces/airframes and primarily designed for thermal loads rather than mechanical loads,' that notice, which expresses interest in 'reusable, weight efficient, thermally driven, metallic airframe and skins,' adds. No further details about the platform or platforms that DARPA and the Air Force might be envisioning for Next RS, including overall size or payload capacity, are provided in any of the contracting notices. As yet, there are no clearly defined requirements that would point to a large aircraft with a big payload. When reached for additional information about the February 5 contracting notice, DARPA told TWZ it could not provide anything else. TWZ has also reached out to AFRL and NASA. Lockheed Martin However, the details about Next RS in hand now are extremely similar to how AFRL previously described the Mayhem program, also referred to as Hypersonic Multi-mission ISR and Strike, and an adjacent effort called Enabling Technologies for High-Speed Operable Systems (ETHOS). Leidos won a contract to develop a scramjet-powered Mayhem air vehicle, which was also expected to be air-launchable from another aircraft, in 2021. Leidos' team also included Calspan, the Draper Laboratory, and Kratos Defense & Security Solutions. However, by the beginning of last year, Mayhem's future had become very murky. 'AFRL is neither terminating the initial task order nor the Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract,' Air Force Col. Aaron Tucker, the High Speed Systems Division Chief at AFRL’s Aerospace Systems Directorate, told TWZ in February 2024. 'The initial task order will be fulfilled with a conceptual design review.' 'The Mayhem program did not receive funding in fiscal year 2024 to proceed beyond the scope of task order 1 (CoDR/SRR),' Tucker added. 'This funding decision results in a year-for-year slip in the development of a digital design and enabling technologies for an air-launched hypersonic ISR [intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance] & strike capability until funds are restored.' Furthermore, 'although AFRL is not terminating the existing contract with Leidos, the operational pull is not clear enough to warrant significant investment to launch and deliver a more complete design package suitable for an acquisition program,' AFRL spokesman Bryan Ripple also told TWZ at that time. 'AFRL may seek to add additional task orders to the Leidos contract in the future.' 'Air Force Global Strike Command [AFGSC] is conducting an Analysis of Alternatives, or AoA, over the next year to refine the requirement for high speed strike and the Office of the Secretary of Defense, or OSD, is continuing to refine leap ahead capability for reuseable applications,' Ripple added. 'What we are more interested in right now, in terms of a feasibility perspective, is a high-mach turbine engine,' a U.S. Air Force official also told TWZ when asked about AFGSC’s interest in Mayhem in February 2024. The current status of Mayhem is unclear and there is a possibility that Next RS is a follow-on or otherwise adjacent to that program. Mayhem, which first emerged back in 2020, has also been tied to another project called the Multi-Mission Cruiser and work on TBCC propulsion systems. The program appearance also followed a still highly curious burst of public discussion around reusable hypersonic aircraft capable of performing strike and ISR missions toward the late 2010s. Central to this was Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works advanced projects division very actively promoting a concept called the SR-72 – a reference to succeeding the company’s famed SR-71 Black Bird spy plane – and related developments. Former company CEO Marillyn Hewson talked openly about potentially building a fighter-sized hypersonic demonstrator for less than $1 billion in 2016. Rob Weiss, then head of Skunk Works, described hypersonic technology as 'mature' at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Aviation Forum the following year and there were reports that an actual flight test of a relevant design could come by 2018. Lockheed Martin's pronouncements even prompted Boeing to subsequently present a competing concept called Valkyrie. An artist’s conception of the proposed SR-72. Lockheed Martin An artist's conception of the proposed SR-72. Lockheed Martin By the end of the 2010s, the SR-72 had disappeared from Lockheed Martin's website and other promotional materials. Talk about the design resurfaced around Skunk Works' creation of a fictional hypersonic aircraft called the Darkstar for the 2022 blockbuster movie Top Gun: Maverick, a design said to be so realistic that parts of it 'could be more than mere fiction.' In 2022, Beoing also released a rendering of a new hypersonic aircraft design, seen below, which looked to have evolved from Valkyrie. The company would not say whether or not it was related to a pitch for Mayhem or work tied to any other U.S. government project. Boeing The Air Force has also publicly worked with various other firms on hypersonic aircraft concepts and related technologies, including with the Hermeus Corporation and Exosonic just in the past few. DARPA and NASA have done extensive research and development related to reusable hypersonic air vehicles over the years, as well. Hermeus has notably been working on a TBCC propulsion system called Chimera. The company is also progressing toward the first flight of its uncrewed Quarterhorse Mk. 1 aircraft, which is powered by a very mundane J85 turbojet engine and is not expected to fly at even supersonic speed. Quarterhorse Mk. 1 is the first of a planned series of designs with progressively more capable propulsion arrangements. We also don't know what else might have been or is still going on in the classified realm in terms of reusable hypersonic aircraft, including with regard to the SR-72 or a similar concept. Running unclassified efforts in parallel with classified ones is not unheard of, and doing so presents benefits, including allowing for the solicitation of proposals to meet certain needs from a wider pool of sources. Whether Next RS reflects work already being done in the classified domain is unknown. Regardless, as TWZ has written in the past about Mayhem: 'Still, a reusable uncrewed air-launched hypersonic strike and reconnaissance aircraft could certainly offer benefits in various operational scenarios. Such a system could be ideal for prosecuting time-sensitive targets, or just gathering intelligence on them, including deep in denied areas at extreme stand-off ranges. From an ISR perspective, spy satellites, which might be the only other option for collecting on the targets in question, could take too long to retask and are predictable, with the enemy knowing when they will pass overhead.' 'An air-launched reusable platform could offer additional flexibility in terms of vector of approach and timely arrival over a target area compared to regional ground and surface-launched concepts.' At the same time, there is a question about whether what a reusable hypersonic aircraft, with all of its complexities, has to offer could be better provided by other capabilities, such as stand-off munitions, including hypersonic types. Whether or not Next RS or any other project leads to an operational reusable hypersonic strike/ISR platform very much remains to be seen. An official Air Force report detailing a vision for that service, as well as the U.S. Space Force, by 2050, which was published in December, notably makes no mention of reusable hypersonic air vehicles, though it does talk about expendable hypersonic weapons. That report did also highlight ever-more serious air defense threats, including anti-air missiles with ranges of up to 1,000 miles, which is in line with the stated drivers behind the Next RS effort. Lockheed Martin Earlier this month, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth also ordered the Air Force to pause a large swath of modernization efforts until a new Air Force Secretary has been confirmed and can review those plans. Hegseth has also issued a memo directing a review of proposed Fiscal Year 2026 spending plans with a goal of shifting roughly eight percent of the entire Department of Defense budget, or approximately $50 billion, to new Trump administration priorities like the Iron Dome missile defense initiative, according to Breaking Defense. The memo, which has not been released publicly, was first reported on by The Washington Post. The Air Force has already been facing an increasingly serious crisis over the affordability of its many modernization priorities. Budgetary concerns, driven in large part by the ballooning costs of the Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) program, notably triggered a deep review last year of plans for a new sixth-generation crewed combat jet being developed under the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative. No decision about the NGAD combat jet's future, which is also intertwined with planning around new Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones and stealth aerial refueling tankers, has been announced so far. All of this has fed into new questions about the optimal size of the future B-21 Raider stealth bomber fleet, as well. A rendering of a notional sixth-generation crewed combat jet. Collins Aerospace What is clear from the emergence of Next RS in the DARPA contracting notice this month is that there remains at least some interest within the Air Force in a reusable hypersonic strike/ISR platform.

Trump Mulls Options To Accelerate Delivery Of Air Force One Jets	President Donald Trump appears to be looking at alternative options for the next Air Force One presidential jet, which has seen its delivery date potentially pushed beyond 2029. As well as recently inspecting a Boeing 747-8 once belonging to the ruling family of Qatar, Trump is reportedly looking into ways of speeding the delivery of the two future VC-25B presidential aircraft, including relaxing security clearances for those working on the jets. The two VC-25Bs are being converted from 747-8i airliners, as you can read more about here. They are due to replace the two existing VC-25As, the first of which entered service in 1990. The VC-25As are based on older 747-200s that are increasingly challenging to support. One of the current VC-25A Air Force One aircraft is seen landing for U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit to the NASCAR Cup Series Daytona 500 at Daytona International Speedway on February 16, 2025, in Daytona Beach, Florida. Photo by Chris Graythen/Getty Images Chris Graythen The 747-8i was the final airliner variant of Boeing’s iconic 747 aircraft and production of the 747 series, as a whole, came to an end for good in December 2022. This means that the new Air Force One presidential jets have to be converted from existing, second-hand airframes, which brings its own set of problems. The final deal for the new Air Force Ones was negotiated under the previous Trump administration, but the process has been far from smooth since then. Last summer, the first flight of the VC-25B was pushed back to March 2026, a delay of 16 months. On top of years of delays, Boeing has recorded over $2 billion in losses on the program, the contract for which was negotiated on a fixed-price basis. Already staggeringly expensive, the new Air Force One program will cost around $4.7 billion for the jets alone, making them the most expensive aircraft ever built. Adding the ancillary costs, including an enormous new hangar at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, with a price tag of around $250 million, provides a total program cost of around $5.3 billion. This is taking into account the much-publicized claims by President Trump that he personally slashed the cost of the jets, although that is debatable. According to Breaking Defense, the Air Force was, as of mid-December, 'still working to validate the schedule' for delivery. This schedule should be completed this spring. The Air Force will then 'conduct a schedule risk assessment to inform establishing revised' dates for key milestones, including delivery dates and operational capability. One of the Boeing 747-8i jets now in the process of becoming a VC-25B Air Force One aircraft heads to Texas in March 2019 to begin conversion. Matt Hartman/Shorealone Films Earlier this week, it was revealed that the VC-25Bs may not be delivered until 2029 or even later — this would mean Trump would not get the opportunity to fly in the aircraft before the end of his second term in office. At one time, the first aircraft had been slated for delivery in December 2024, but Boeing then pushed that back until at least 2027 or 2028. This latest delay was confirmed to Reuters by a White House official, who cited supply chain issues and changing requirements as the reasons. They said that the delay could actually stretch 'years beyond' 2029. The official pointed to problems in acquiring components for the aircraft since some of the manufacturers had gone out of business. At the same time, they noted that some requirements have been revised based on 'evolving potential threats,' according to the report. President Donald Trump walks down the stairs as he exits Air Force One at Valley International Airport in Harlingen, Texas. Photo by Go Nakamura/Getty Images Go Nakamura 'Clearly, the president would like the airplane earlier, and so we’re working to see what could be done to accomplish that,' Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg said last month. Since taking office, it seems that Trump, frustrated by the mounting delays, might have taken a more direct approach, including engaging his close ally Elon Musk. At the end of last month, Boeing’s Ortberg told CNBC that 'we’re working with Elon to see what can we do to pull up the schedule.' In remarks today, Ortberg added: 'Elon Musk is actually helping us a lot in working through the requirements … so that we can move faster and get the president those airplanes delivered.' More details of some of the options Trump and Musk might be looking at emerged today in a report from The New York Times, which cites five unnamed people with knowledge of the discussions. Elon Musk holds up an Air Force One stuffed toy as he walks from the presidential helicopter Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House on February 19, 2025, in Washington, DC. Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images Win McNamee The most radical option in that report involves 'relaxing security clearance standards for some who work on the presidential planes.' This would mean that Boeing could engage workers for the VC-25B that don’t have the currently required high-level Yankee White security clearance, the same that military personnel would need for interaction with the president or the vice president. Reportedly, officials are only looking at relaxing the clearance for employees not involved in most secure parts. Nevertheless, the implications of such a move, were it to happen, would be significant. After all, every aspect of the Air Force One platforms is closely tailored to ensure the highest levels of security, befitting its mission, including as an airborne command center. While it’s claimed that Boeing officials consider that relaxing some security clearance standards is possible, for certain types of workers, anything that could compromise the safety of the president — and the security of the United States — would clearly be unacceptable. Musk is reportedly also critical of the amount of time built into the program for flight testing. Again, however, any move that could compromise the safety requirements for Air Force One is hardly likely to be palatable, especially when the net gain might only be getting it into service several months earlier. A rendering of a VC-25B with the livery President Trump selected during his first term in office. Boeing Reportedly, Musk visited the Boeing facility in San Antonio, Texas, last December, intending to find ways to accelerate the production of the VC-25Bs. 'The idea was that we could just strip out a lot of the military stuff, just give the president a good-looking new airplane to fly in with commercial capabilities and maybe some minimal military upgrades,' an unnamed former Pentagon official told The New York Times. While that would certainly be feasible, the end result would most not fit the Air Force One requirements, including playing its part in the critical ‘continuity of government’ mission — which you can read about in-depth here — and operating in the most demanding situations, including a nuclear apocalypse. As well as being hardened against the effects of electromagnetic pulse (EMP), it’s also worth bearing in mind that the VC-25s are equipped with extremely elaborate communications systems and the most capable single self-defense suite against man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS), as well as some other threats, found anywhere on the planet. The article also states that consideration is being given to acquiring another airframe, which would be refitted at short notice and then used as an interim transport until the VC-25Bs are ready. This would be the 747-8 that Trump toured at Palm Beach International, Florida, on Saturday. This 12-year-old aircraft previously belonged to the ruling family of Qatar but was subsequently refurbished and is now privately owned. You can read all about it in this previous in-depth piece.

It arrived from Doha and returned there shortly after the tour. pic.twitter.com/PvLGFVs43l&mdash; Jack Sweeney (@Jxck_Sweeney) February 17, 2025 The White House said that Trump wanted to look at the ex-Qatari jet to see 'how everything was configured,' in relation to the new VC-25Bs, although The New York Times suggests that the president might actually want the Air Force to buy it. If that were the case, it is extremely questionable whether the ex-Qatari 747-8 would offer anything like a practical solution — especially the reported aspiration to have the jet retrofitted for the Air Force service 'within a year’s time.' After all, even for interim service, the aircraft would still require extensive conversion work followed by certification and it’s far from clear how all this could be achieved in such a short timeframe — let alone, why it would be significantly easier than is the case with the VC-25Bs. Were the ex-Qatari 747-8 somehow rushed into service in a more basic configuration that would be achieved quicker, it would leave the Air Force with a non-standard presidential fleet once the VC-25Bs finally arrive. It may also be the case that Trump’s visit to the ex-Qatari jet was more about providing Boeing with a very obvious signal that the high-stakes Air Force One program is very much in his sights. Another proposition could involve canceling Boeing’s Air Force One contract altogether and handing the work over to another contractor. The most obvious would be Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC), which has been contracted to deliver a fleet of highly specialized Survivable Airborne Operations Center (SAOC) aircraft. These will replace the Air Force’s aging 747-200-based E-4B Nightwatch ‘doomsday planes.’ However, while Trump has been repeatedly critical of Boeing’s business practice in the past, such a radical move at this stage would likely also not get the new Air Force Ones into service any quicker. Whatever happens next, Boeing’s VC-25B effort has become something of a lesson in how not to run an Air Force acquisition program. Already, there have been issues with security clearance lapses for workers involved in the program and the discovery of empty liquor bottles in one of the airframes. There have also been tiny cracks discovered in the aircraft’s structures, requiring repairs. A rendering of a VC-25B in a paint scheme more in line with the iconic ones on the existing VC-25A Air Force Ones. President Joe Biden reversed the decision made by his predecessor, Donald Trump, during his first term in office, which would have seen the aircraft wear an entirely new red, white, and blue livery. Depending on the delivery timeline, that would appear to be now back on the table. U.S. Air Force One of the biggest stories surrounding the new Air Force One jets is their paint scheme. Trump wants to get rid of the classic design that is steeped in Kennedy-era history and replace it with his own red, white and blue look. It's possible that if the jets get pushed nearly into 2030, he will not get to make this decision. It's only the delays in the program that put the Air Force One paint job question back in his lap after being elected to his second term.

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) Alex Wong Whether it’s discussions about the colors of their livery, or much more dramatic changes to the aircraft and their capabilities, the new Air Force One program has never been far from controversy. However, it’s already clear that, under the Trump administration, these high-profile aircraft will be under even closer scrutiny.

M10 Booker Undergoing Cold Weather Trials In Alaska	Eyeing a potential future fight in the Arctic, the Army is putting its new light tank-like M10 Booker Combat Vehicle through a series of cold-weather tests at Fort Greely, Alaska. The trials come as the U.S. military is seeking to boost its ability to fight in the Arctic, an area of increasing strategic importance. Soldiers are conducting 'primarily reliability testing as well as automotive, systems and firing at extreme cold temperatures,' Ashely John, a spokesperson for the Army’s Next Generation Ground Vehicle Cross-Functional Team told us. The Greely cold-weather trial was prescribed when Booker’s testing plan was approved in Fiscal Year 2022, she added. There is also hot weather testing underway, both of which are normal for major weapons systems like this. (U.S. Army) It is unclear when the testing at Greely will conclude, how it performed in the cold or what soldiers using the vehicles think about them. We asked the Army and will update this story with any pertinent details provided. The Booker was designed under the Mobile Protected Firepower (MPF) program to fill a capability gap the Army identified after two decades of largely counter-insurgency operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. There was little need at the time for a light tank-like vehicle that could bridge the gap between the M-1 Abrams main battle tank and armored vehicles like the Bradley and Stryker. A Stryker Mobile Gun System variant had a 105mm gun, but the Army divested that in 2021 because of problems with its dated cannon and autoloader. That platform was also far less protected than the Booker and its wheels meant it could not navigates rough terrain like the tracked M10 can. With an MTU 8v199 TE-22, 800 hp diesel engine and an Allison transmission, the Booker can travel at up to about 40 mph. Armed with a 105mm main gun, the vehicles won’t have as much firepower as the Abrams with its 120mm gun. Nor will the Bookers have as much armor to protect them. But they will require much less fuel and a far smaller logistical tail, and they will still be able to deliver a badly needed punch that can destroy armor, bunkers, and fortifications. Perhaps more importantly, they will get to the fight, including arriving at remote locales via airlift, far faster than an Abrams ever could. This could be critical in defending arctic locales during a crisis. You can learn more about the Booker in our detailed profile video below. The Army is planning to to buy more than 500 Bookers from General Dynamics Land Systems and have four Booker battalions fielded by 2030, with most of the planned acquisition scheduled to be completed by 2035, according to the Congressional Research Service (CRS). With a projected price tag of about $13 million a piece, the total package would be about $6.5 billion. The total life-cycle cost of the program, including sustainment, military construction and personnel, is estimated at $17 billion, Defense News reported. You can read more about the Booker’s capabilities and planned future role in our story here. The M10 Booker's 105mm main gun is powerful enough to take on Chinese armor, says an armor expert. (U.S. Army photo) The Army has previously described operating in the Arctic, where the lowest temperatures can reach between −65 and −50° F, as just being a struggle to survive, let alone fight an enemy. At Fort Greely, winters have an average temperature of -13°F. That drastic climate creates extreme stress on troops and equipment. That played out in 2022 when the Army withdrew a fleet of 8×8 Stryker wheeled vehicles from Alaska in part because of persistent difficulties in keeping them running in cold weather conditions. Those vehicles had been assigned to what is now known as 1st Brigade Combat Team, 11th Airborne Division at Fort Wainwright in Fairbanks. In 2022, the division received BvS10 Beowulf tracked vehicles as its new Cold Weather All-Terrain Vehicle, or CATV to help transport troops and equipment. You can read more about how the Army is trying to cope with fighting under frigid conditions in our deep dive here. Beowulf can carry up to 14 soldiers. (BAE Systems) BAE Systems For the Army, being able to conduct combat operations in the Arctic is critical. The region has seen renewed strategic attention from the U.S. military for years now. Global climate change has caused the polar ice caps to recede, opening up new access to natural resources and trade routes. This, in turn, has created new geopolitical competition, and the potential for conflict, especially with Russia and China, as a byproduct. President Donald Trump’s keen interest in acquiring Greenland highlights the importance of the Arctic. There are several challenges when an armor track vehicle operates in the cold. 'Arctic conditions make starting armored vehicle engines, especially diesel engines, difficult due to battery power loss and potential fuel gelling,' an armor expert familiar with the Booker told us. 'Preheating techniques may be necessary, and fuel additives (such as anti-gel treatments) are required to prevent it from thickening up depending if it’s diesel or JP8.' In addition, 'batteries and electronics may have issues due to extreme cold, reducing battery efficiency affecting vehicle startup, communications systems, and fire control systems,' the expert explained. 'Also electrical wiring insulation can become brittle and crack, increasing the risk of malfunctions.' There can be hydraulic and lubrication issues as well 'because Arctic temperatures thicken hydraulic fluids and lubricants slowing turret traverse and gun elevation,' the expert noted. 'Also, the oil viscosity changes can reduce engine and transmission efficiency.' The rubber tracks 'may become brittle and more prone to cracking. The track suspension such as torsion bars, and shock absorbers may stiffen, impacting ride quality and performance over rough terrain. Finally, snow and ice buildup in the running gear can cause track slippage and jamming,' according to the expert. Beyond that, 'condensation on the optics, sensors, circuit boards, and other electronics caused by the rapid temperature changes can lead to ice buildups and then lead to malfunctioning.' Testing armor like this M1 Abrams tank at Fort Greely can find glitches in cold weather operations unimaginable in the desert. (Sebastian Saarloos) The Arctic testing will be important to see whether Booker is suitable for the region beyond just being able to stand up to the elements. Mobility and smaller logistics trains are two critical requirements for the Arctic, where bases are few and far between, increasing the challenge of keeping vehicles maintained and fueled. At 41 tons, the Booker weighs about 40% less than the Abrams. Smaller in dimensions and having no heavy side skirt, two can be delivered by a single C-17 Globemaster III, roll out of its cargo bay, and be combat-ready for wherever needed far more rapidly than an Abrams, the expert said. By contrast, only one 70-plus-ton Abrams can fit on a C-17 and they can take days to reach their destination. The Arctic isn’t the only place where the Army is testing Booker. The vehicles are also undergoing testing at the Yuma Proving Ground (YPG) in Arizona. 'In addition to test firing the armaments in both the natural environment and from a cold chamber, the platform is being subjected to a full complement of performance and reliability, accessibility, and maintainability testing,' the Army said in a recent media release.

(Mark Shauer) There is plenty of additional testing planned for these vehicles, as well. Beyond how it performs in the cold and other trials, Booker faces other challenges. The war in Ukraine has, in some respects, changed the way armor is looked at on the modern battlefield. In particular, armor has shown itself extremely vulnerable to drones, especially first-person view (FPV) variants. Alterations to existing designs — none of which Booker possesses at this time — has helped harden them against this threat, but even the Abrams remains susceptible to it. 'Given this threat and reported vulnerability, Congress might further explore with the Army-specific M-10 design characteristics and countermeasures intended to address the threat posed by UAS and loitering munitions,' the Congressional Research Service (CRS) suggested in its report on the vehicle last month. In addition, the Trump administration is eyeing the Pentagon budget and cuts to weapons programs and enhancements to others are sure to be on the horizon. Time will tell whether the Army procures the hundreds of Bookers it wants.

This Is What A Peacekeeping Air Policing Mission Over Ukraine Cou...	The United Kingdom is reportedly prepared to send Typhoon fighters to support a future air policing mission over Ukraine. The apparent proposal comes only a day after the leaders of several European nations met to discuss whether to send troops to help bolster any deal to end the Ukraine war, something you can read more about here. The Times of London today cited a 'senior government source' as saying that an 'air policing' mission for Ukraine would make sense, although also warning that it would need significant numbers of aircraft, as well as ground-based air defense systems to protect the jets on the ground.

Crown Copyright The same report suggests that British ministers have already discussed ways to provide security guarantees to Ukraine without the need for large numbers of troops on the ground. With that in mind, one proposal involves potentially 'dozens' of U.K. Royal Air Force (RAF) Typhoons that would monitor Russian air activity and help protect a 'smaller peacekeeping force of troops' from the United Kingdom and other European countries on the ground. Previously, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that a future peacekeeping force might require as many as 110,000 foreign troops on the ground in the country, with perhaps three times that number in total to enable rotational deployments.

It now seems that a more powerful air policing contingent might be increasingly seen as a way of compensating for the smaller troop presence, which would otherwise be insufficient to monitor and patrol the extent of whatever Ukraine’s future land border with Russian-controlled territory will look like. Regardless of where the border will be redrawn and to what degree Ukraine gets parts of its sovereign territory back, this new border would become the line of control. An unnamed RAF source told The Times of London that an air policing mission was more likely than a no-fly zone of the kind that would normally serve to sanitize airspace above an area that does not benefit from a line of control. A Russian Il-20 Coot-A aircraft intercepted during a QRA scramble by RAF Typhoons from Siauliai Air Base, Lithuania, in June 2020. Crown Copyright In contrast, an air policing mission is primarily a peacetime effort that provides surveillance as well as fighter aircraft that can rapidly respond to possible airspace violations and other contingencies. Of course, the nature of the response will then depend on a host of operational considerations, but it could extend to engaging that aircraft if it was determined to be undertaking a hostile action. All this would depend on the nature of the potential ceasefire agreement — at this point, we are still in the very early stages of such an agreement taking shape. Already, however, there are reports that consideration has been given to basing air policing aircraft in Poland, while the same RAF source added: 'We are prepared to do whatever we are told to do.' TWZ spoke to Air Marshal (Ret’d.) Greg Bagwell, the president of the Air and Space Power Association, one of the RAF’s most experienced former operational commanders, who oversaw combat operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and Syria, as well as various peacekeeping missions worldwide. Air Vice Marshal Greg Bagwell speaking to the media at an Italian Air Force base from where the RAF was patrolling the no-fly zone over Libya in 2011. Photo by Chris Ison/PA Images via Getty Images Chris Ison - PA Images Bagwell notes that the U.K. military will almost certainly already be doing contingency planning for a potential peacekeeping mission. 'I would be amazed if people in the Ministry of Defense, Permanent Joint Headquarters, and the likes weren’t at least thinking through some of the challenges and some of the things that you’d need to put in place as part of it. Some of that conversation may even leak into NATO, or European nations of a like mind — a coalition of the willing, if you like — so that they could think through what sort of assets would be needed and who might provide them.' At this early stage, however, nothing will be formal and, as Bagwell observes, 'Nobody’s asked the exact question, apart from just making offers, or just talking about it in principle.' Obviously, any air policing mission for Ukraine, or whatever kind of peacekeeping force, first requires a peace to keep. 'If it is a peacekeeping mission, then it would need agreed rules, if you like, for what that peace was supposed to be, which would include boundaries and the rules of engagement to match,' Bagwell says. Bagwell also notes that the talk of European nations sending 'troops' to Ukraine, or in support of Ukraine, post-ceasefire, could also refer to air forces (and navies) as well as ground troops. 'It could be anybody from any service depending on the requirement … whatever it would take to maintain peace and you’re going to need to do that on land, sea, and air.'

In this particular case, let’s be honest, we’re pretty much talking about keeping one side out. I would expect that policing to be done almost exclusively on the Ukrainian side of that line, and it would be both to keep an eye on any air activity and any potential encroachment, but it would also be used to keep an eye on anything going on the ground, both at the border and beyond.' In such a scenario, the aircraft involved — be they RAF, other NATO, or from different friendly nations — would be used to patrol the line of control. Ultimately, their job would be to forbid Russian aircraft — but potentially also Ukrainian aircraft — from encroaching within a certain distance, whatever that distance may turn out to be.

Crown Copyright 'The problem is, these days, with the long range of air-launched weapons, you need to keep airplanes quite a long way away to ensure that they’re not releasing weapons or potentially conducting an attack. So that buffer might become quite large.' Even so, Bagwell considers that creating a buffer zone exclusively within Ukraine would be sufficient in this particular case. As well as monitoring the airspace for aircraft encroaching beyond the line of control, the mission would almost certainly involve some monitoring of forces on the ground, too. This would then raise the question of how close Ukrainian and Russian ground forces would be allowed to get within that line. Whatever the rules, this is something that would probably be easiest to monitor from the air or space.

Photo by Diego Herrera Carcedo/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu 'To airmen, the problem won’t be that challenging,' Bagwell contends. 'I mean, if it goes wrong, it will be challenging. But in terms of working out how to segregate the airspace, how to have the right sensors in the right places to detect what’s going on, and then to have the rules of engagement, and the right things in the right places to intercept or investigate or warn off. If it gets really sticky, those are well-worn procedures that you just have to apply and adapt to the specific circumstances.' The fact that participants — very likely NATO members — would potentially be going head-to-head with Russian forces 'obviously carries an additional degree of risk,' Bagwell notes, 'but we’ve done that pretty recently in Syria. We’ve had Western coalition assets flying extremely close to Russian assets, and we’ve managed just about stay out of each other’s way. But it gets fruity at times.' Footage of a Russian Su-35S Flanker that reportedly violated coalition airspace in Syria in April 2023, before being intercepted by U.S. Air Force fighters: There are then logistical questions to address, although it already seems inconceivable that an air policing mission for Ukraine could be conducted by the RAF alone — at least if it were to be both fully capable and to endure over an extended period. Policing such a large area would involve an operation with a degree of magnitude bigger than anything that the RAF has attempted in recent history and would surely only be attempted as part of a broader coalition. 'The border itself is vast,' Bagwell says. 'You’re talking about covering a very large piece of airspace. I think the real question is ‘How secure is the peace?’ If we’ve got to a situation where both sides have stood back from each other and are not literally staring at each other from a trench 100 yards away, if they are now miles apart, and things have returned to a relatively stable situation, then monitoring that more stable situation is something that can be done from a more measured perspective.' In theory, Bagwell notes, such a situation could involve a ground alert scenario where, if it was known, for example, that an aircraft had got airborne and was heading west, a fighter could get airborne and head east to ensure that it didn’t encroach. In this way, it’s conceivable that the operation could get to a stage where it would require a relatively low posture in terms of numbers, but offer very fast response times. A Romanian Air Force F-16 and a pair of Typhoons conduct an intercept as part of a NATO training mission in Romania. Crown Copyright SAC Harry Roberts 'That’s the beauty of air, of course — it can respond quickly,' Bagwell continues. 'You could, in theory, control minor incursions or relatively small amounts of air activity.' On the other hand, if the situation as regards Russia were to become more hostile, to the point where the air policing force was facing 'a hornets’ nest, but only 50 miles away,' then the scenario would look altogether different, as Bagwell explains. 'You’re then effectively looking to deter; it goes beyond air policing and then really does become a sort of air deterrence mission, where you’re saying: ‘Don’t you dare cross here, because you’ll get something back at you’ — assuming you’ve got rules of engagement for that.' However, even providing a ground-alert-type operation, in a relatively stable environment, would involve a lot of assets and expenditure. Furthermore, these assets would likely have to be in Ukraine, Bagwell contends, from where they would be able to fly three or four combat air patrols, between 100 and 200 miles apart, up and down the border, flying around the clock to maintain an air presence. This would be impossible for the RAF to achieve on its own, demanding a multinational rotational force. Bagwell provides the example of putting just one combat air patrol up with two aircraft — which he says would be the bare minimum. 'Just to keep those two jets in that orbit for 24 hours takes almost a squadron’s worth of airplanes and crews to sustain it in the long term, because you’re putting two up every couple of hours … in a worst-case scenario, you could easily swallow up the entire Royal Air Force’s assets if they were doing on it their own, just to give you an idea of scale.' A live-armed RAF Typhoon returning to its base after a scramble callout for a Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) mission over the North Sea near U.K. airspace. Crown Copyright For the best-case scenario, Bagwell expects the operation 'might be able to get away with one or two squadrons, one or two airborne radar airplanes, and a few tankers, but that would be thin, and if Russia tested it, it would be found wanting pretty quickly.' Airborne early warning would be a critical asset for this kind of mission, giving the ability to see a lot further into Russian airspace, especially from a relatively high altitude, fairly close to the border. This would allow incoming aircraft to be detected very early on. A NATO E-3A Airborne Warning And Control System (AWACS) aircraft takes off from the NATO air base at Geilenkirchen, Germany. Photo by Christof Koepsel/Getty Images Christof Koepsel While Bagwell can envisage that a Ukraine air policing operation could be a relatively low-cost scenario, compared to a bigger deployment of peacekeeping ground troops, his instinct is that considering it might be unclear how it plays out, commanders 'might want to err on the side of caution and put more in than they need.' For a larger-scale operation, the possibility exists to have assets flown from outside Ukraine, for example operating from bases in Poland or Romania and then flying into Ukraine on patrol, using air-to-air refueling. On the other hand, having other nations on the ground in Ukraine — including in the form of aircraft — could also have a deterrent value, forcing Russia to think twice about future incursions, because of the complications it would bring. Ultimately, there would be an aspiration that Ukraine would be able to take on at least some of the burden of air policing duties, something that will now be easier since it’s receiving Western fighter aircraft — first the F-16, and more recently the Mirage 2000. These aircraft types are already more capable of being integrated into a Western-style air defense system, which would also give Ukraine the ability to plug into a broader network and make it more capable as a peacetime policing air force.

Photo by Vitalii Nosach/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images Photo by Vitalii Nosach/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images On the other hand, it remains to be seen just how quickly Ukraine can adjust and adapt to policing its own airspace, also based on the number of Western fighters it is receiving and the speed with which it can integrate these newer systems. Regardless, having the Ukrainian Air Force conduct these kinds of post-ceasefire operations would no longer be peacekeeping, but a continuation of two sides standing off against each other. Once again, this brings us to the argument that politicians in Europe are now grappling with, which suggests that air policing needs to be done independently by a third party. Herein lies the problem of Russia’s reluctance to have a third party involved that is also a NATO member or operating under some kind of NATO jurisdiction. Without a doubt, the situation is complicated. In Bagwell’s words, 'this is probably as tricky as it gets,' based on the potential consequences of something going wrong. At the same time, it’s worth noting that NATO’s Article Five wouldn’t cover NATO assets operating in Ukraine, since it doesn’t extend outside the alliance’s boundary. This would be a factor if Russia engaged a NATO aircraft involved in a Ukraine air policing mission, although it’s doubtful that the alliance would simply let Russia trample over a Western presence in the country without any sort of response. It’s here that U.S. involvement in any kind of air policing effort is perhaps most critical. If Europe’s NATO allies are to go it alone and set up some kind of air policing initiative, it will still be a relatively small stick compared to Russia’s military might. As such, it will surely benefit from America’s much bigger stick to back it up.

F-16s With Larger Laser-Guided Rocket Loads, Drone Kill Marking E...	New pictures show U.S. Air Force F-16C Viper fighters on patrol in and around the Middle East with loadouts that include two seven-shot 70mm rocket pods, and both on the same pylon, rather than just one as has been seen previously. The same images also show an F-16C armed with a mix of AIM-120 AMRAAM and AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles and sporting a drone kill marking. TWZ first reported last month that Air Force Vipers have been using laser-guided 70mm Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II (APKWS II) rockets, originally designed as air-to-ground munitions, as a lower-cost way to down Houthi drones. The U.S. Air Forces Central (AFCENT), the service's top command for operations in the Middle East, released two sets of pictures of F-16s flying in the region earlier today. The photographs were all taken earlier this month. A pair of US Air Force F-16Cs fly somewhere over the Middle East on February 11, 2025. The jet seen at the rear has the two seven-shot 70mm rocket pods. USAF Staff Sgt. Jackson Manske The image sets show pairs of F-16Cs flying together and, in both cases, one of the Vipers has a pair of seven-round 70mm rocket pods on a single pylon under its right wing with the help of a triple ejector rack (TER), as seen below. Each of the rocket-armed jets also are seen carrying two AIM-9X Sidewinders, two AIM-120s, a LITENING targeting pod, a HARM Targeting System (HTS) pod, and two drop tanks. As noted, pictures AFCENT has previously released have shown F-16s with one rocket pod instead of two, but otherwise similar load-outs. A version of the single rocket pod loadout has also been observed on Vipers forward-deployed in Japan. USAF The other Vipers seen in the new pictures are armed with four Sidewinders each – a mixture of AIM-9M and AIM-9X variants – and two AIM-120s, as well as the same array of pods and drops tanks. One of these jets also has a drone kill marking, as well as six others that are silhouettes of a revolver, on the left side of the fuselage right under the forward end of the cockpit canopy. What the revolvers signify is unknown, but they might reflect the destruction of targets with the jet's 20mm M61 Vulcan cannon, a six-barrel Gatling-type design. This particular aircraft also has three large rows of badly worn air-to-ground mission marks. A picture of the air-to-air missile-armed F-16 with the kill markings. USAF A close-up look at the kill markings. Some of the faded air-to-ground mission marks are also visible. USAF Other U.S. military combat jets, as well as American and other foreign warships, have previously emerged with drone and missile kill markings in relation to operations against the Houthis in and around the Red Sea. A Navy EA-18G Growler electronic warfare jet also now has a silhouette of a Hind attack helicopter painted on its fuselage after having blown one up on the ground in Yemen with an AGM-88E Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile (AARGM), which TWZ was first to confirm. The appearance of F-16s in the Middle East with larger rocket loads is not surprising. As TWZ highlighted in January in our first report on the use of APKWS II in the air-to-air role, even a single seven-shot pod of the laser-guided rockets dramatically increases the Viper's total magazine depth. As seen again in the newly released pictures, an F-16 with a more typical air-to-air loadout carries just six missiles. An annotated image of an Air Force F-16C flying in the Middle East with the single rocket pod loadout. USAF Underscoring the importance of magazine depth, during the separate U.S. operations in the defense of Israel against incoming waves of Iranian drones and missiles, F-15E Strike Eagles had to land and rearm while threats were still passing overhead. At least one Strike Eagle crew switched to the jet's Vulcan cannon after running out of missiles, but was unable to down any targets with the gun. The F-15E has far more payload capacity than the F-16C to begin with, though the Strike Eagle is not currently cleared to carry APKWS IIs. An F-15E Strike Eagle brandishing various air-to-air missiles and precision-guided bombs during a recent sortie somewhere in the Middle East. USAF There's also the associated cost benefit. An APKWS II rocket consists of a laser guidance kit slotted in between one of a variety of warheads and a standard 70mm rocket motor. A single guidance unit costs between around $15,000 to $20,000. Warheads and motors add a few thousand dollars more to the price tag of each complete rocket. By comparison, traditional air-to-air missiles are hundreds of thousands of dollars or more apiece. APKWS II does have limitations in the air-to-air role. As TWZ has previously explained: 'In an air-to-air engagement, the laser designator in the LITENING pod could be used to ‘laze’ or designate the target. LITENING’s sensor turret can be slaved to the radar on the aircraft carrying it, or vice versa. So-called buddy lasing, where one aircraft designates the target for another, could also be useful in this case, especially given the speed differential between typical Houthi drones and F-16s. One jet could keep the target steadily lazed while the other makes its attack run.' 'APKWS IIs are usable against drones, as well as subsonic cruise missiles, in the first place because those are relatively steady, non-reactionary, low-performance targets. The rockets are not dogfighting weapons.' After first being demonstrated as an air-to-air weapon, at least publicly, in 2019, APKWS II has clearly become a valuable addition to the U.S. military's aerial arsenal in this role. Further expanded loadouts could now begin to emerge. Asymmetrical load of two seven-shot pods under each wing would give an F-16 28 total engagement opportunities just with laser-guided rockets. Similar loadouts could be a boon for other aircraft, especially when facing down large drone and missile attacks. In addition to the Viper, the AV-8B Harrier, A-10 Warthog, and F/A-18 Hornet fixed-wing aircraft, as well as AH-1Z, UH-1Y, and MH-60R/S helicopters, are currently cleared to employ APKWS II. APKWS II is also combat-proven in the surface-to-air role against drones and as a surface-to-surface weapon, as well as an air-to-ground munition. There is work now to at least test a passive infrared seeker for the rockets, which would further expand their capabilities, as you can read more about here. The use of the 70mm laser-guided rockets in the air-to-air role, at least in the Middle East, already looks to be expanding.

War Of Words Erupts Between Trump And Zelensky	The war of words between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky erupted on Wednesday in a remarkable series of tit-for-tat accusations highlighting a growing schism between Washington and Kyiv. The increasingly harsh exchanges come in the wake of U.S.-Russia negotiations to end the war in Ukraine and the sudden move to normalize relations between the U.S. and Russia. The talks in Riyadh did not provide Ukraine with a seat at the negotiating table. In a post on his Truth Social platform Wednesday morning, Trump called Zelensky a 'moderately successful comedian' and strongly implied a lack of support for Ukraine and its leader. 'A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left,' Trump stated. '…I love Ukraine, but Zelenskyy has done a terrible job, his Country is shattered, and MILLIONS have unnecessarily died – And so it continues…..' Think of it, a modestly successful comedian, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, talked the United States of America into spending $350 Billion Dollars, to go into a War that couldn’t be won, that never had to start, but a War that he, without the U.S. and 'TRUMP,' will never be able to settle.…&mdash; Donald J. Trump Posts From His Truth Social (@TrumpDailyPosts) February 19, 2025 Trump also repeated his accusations about U.S. aid for Ukraine. Zelensky 'talked the United States of America into spending $350 Billion Dollars, to go into a War that couldn’t be won, that never had to start, but a War that he, without the U.S. and ‘TRUMP,’ will never be able to settle. The United States has spent $200 Billion Dollars more than Europe, and Europe’s money is guaranteed, while the United States will get nothing back.' Those figures, however, contradict information compiled by the Kiel Institute For The World Econonmy’s Ukraine Support Tracker. Those figures show that Europe – counted as the sum of the EU and individual member states – has allocated $137.9 billion in help for Ukraine, which is more than the nearly $119 billion from the U.S. More than half of the U.S. aid to Ukraine - $66.5 billion - was for direct security assistance in the form of donated weapons, according to Pentagon figures. Data compiled by the Kiel Institute shows Europe outpaced the U.S. in aid to Ukraine. (Kiel Institute) U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance echoed Trump's sentiments. 'The idea that Zelensky is going to change the president's mind by badmouthing him in public media, everyone who knows the President will tell you that is an atrocious way to deal with this administration,' Vance told the Daily Mail.

'Unfortunately, President Trump – I have great respect for him as a leader of a nation that we have great respect for, the American people who always support us – unfortunately lives in this disinformation space,' Zelensky told reporters in Kyiv. 'I wish Trump’s team had more truth. Because none of this is having a positive effect on Ukraine.' Ukraine President Zelenskyy said U.S. President Trump is living in a Russian 'disinformation space' regarding his previous day’s comments about the Ukrainian leader’s approval rating.Trump said at Mar-a-Lago that Zelenskyy’s rating stood at 4%. The Associated Press (@AP) February 19, 2025 Zelensky was reacting to Trump's suggestion that he was not a legitimate leader and only had a 4% approval rating. 'As we are talking about the 4% [approval rating for me] we have seen this information,' Zelensky explained. 'We understand it is coming from Russia. We understand that and we have proof that these numbers are being discussed between America and Russia.' He did not share that proof, however, according to the latest research published by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, 57% of Ukrainians trust Zelensky. 'This morning, KIIS published a poll showing 57% trust in me. So if someone wants to replace me right now – it won’t work,' – Zelensky. The President added that the disinformation about 4% comes from Russia, which spread this narrative to the Americans. pic.twitter.com/BehR1G6xTv&mdash; NOELREPORTS (@NOELreports) February 19, 2025 Zelensky also lashed out at Trump’s comment that Ukraine started the war, as well as the agreement struck between the U.S. and Russia paving the path toward a peace deal. That four-point plan seeks greater cooperation between Moscow and Washington and subsequent comments by top U.S. negotiators suggested Ukraine might have to give up territory without reciprocal concessions by Russia. 'They are letting Putin out of isolation and I think Putin and the Russian people are very happy, because they are involved in discussions and yesterday there were signals that they are the victims. That is something new.' Even former Vice President Mike Pence weighed in to support Zelensky, offering a public reminder on social media that Russia started the war on Feb. 24, 2022. 'Mr. President, Ukraine did not 'start' this war,' Pence said on X. 'Russia launched an unprovoked and brutal invasion claiming hundreds of thousands of lives. The Road to Peace must be built on the Truth.' Mr. President, Ukraine did not 'start' this war. Russia launched an unprovoked and brutal invasion claiming hundreds of thousands of lives.

'It is shameful to hear the president repeat Putin’s propaganda while laying the groundwork for negotiations that favor Russia at Ukraine’s expense.'

'‘Trump isn’t even trying to hide his irritation with Zelensky,’ the Rossiya channel said at the top of its newscast, according to the wire service. 'Trump steamrolled Zelensky for his complaints about the talks with Russia,' the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda said, AP added. Ultra-nationalistic Russian philosopher Alexander Dugin also expressed joy over the angry discourse between the American and Ukrainian leaders. 'Checkmate,' he stated on X. 'Zelensky and his regime is over. Now he will be betrayed literally by everybody. Terrible destiny - to lose all - power, country, esteem, soul (if there was any), respect. And soon life I presume.'

'At that time, 73% of respondents preferred fighting for victory. In 2023, this number dropped to 63%, and by 2024, there has been a noticeable increase in war fatigue among the population.' However, 'it is important to emphasize that this does not mean support for peace talks between the U.S. and Russia without Ukraine’s participation,' SIC-Group explained. 'Representatives of Ukrainian civil society strongly condemn such negotiations, stressing that any agreements about Ukraine without its direct involvement are unacceptable and contrary to international law.' Putin, meanwhile, offered his own take on the peace process. He said that Kyiv is not being cut out of the peace talks. Offering a readout of his previous conversation with Trump, Putin confirmed that he was told Ukraine would be part of any negotiations.

Massive WWII B-29 Bomber Base Fully Reclaimed For Future Pacific ...	Satellite imagery shows the extent of the massive amount of work that has been done in the past year to restore more than 20 million square feet of runways and other World War II-era infrastructure at historic North Field on the U.S. island of Tinian in the Western Pacific. The airfield was originally established as a launchpad for B-29 bomber raids on Imperial Japan, including the ones that saw atomic bombs dropped on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The facility has been refurbished to again offer a critical power projection node with its original grid-like layout presenting targeting challenges for a modern opponent, all of which could be especially valuable in a future high-end fight in the region against China. A series of satellite images of North Field taken between December 3, 2023, and January 29, 2025, by Planet Labs starkly illustrates just how extensive the reconstitution of the derelict airfield has become. The images, as can seen below, show the progressive clearing of the previously overgrown runways, taxiways, and other infrastructure. PHOTO © 2025 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Additional satellite imagery from Planet Labs shows the ongoing work to expand Tinian International Airport further to the south of North Field, which is also to support U.S. military operations in the region. As seen below, a very large new apron and adjacent taxiway are being built to the north of the airport's existing runway. Additional infrastructure, including new fuel storage facilities at Tinian's main port at the south end of the island, is also included in the divert field project, as you can read more about here.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION The U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force have been working together on the military construction across Tinian. Tinian is one of the 14 islands that comprise the U.S. Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). It is situated in the Western Pacific some 120 miles northeast of Guam, which is another U.S. territory, but is not part of the CNMI. A map showing the general location of Tinian, at left, with Guam directly to its south. Wake Island, at center, and Hawaii, at right, are also marked. Google Maps At the height of operations in 1945, North Field had four 8,500-foot-long runways and associated taxiways, ramp space for more than 500 B-29s, and other facilities to support the approximately 40,000 personnel stationed at the base, according to the U.S. National Park Service (NPS). U.S. Navy construction battalions, better known as Seabees, led the work to enlarge what had been a far smaller Japanese airfield following the island's capture in 1944. North Field seen during World War II. This picture was taken before the fourth runway was built. US Army Air Force 'Because the shape of the island was reminiscent of Manhattan, New York, the Seabees laid it out in a pattern, and with place names, based on the city streets there,' per NPS. By the time World War II ended, North Field was the largest airfield anywhere in the world. However, the massive drawdown that followed the conclusion of the war led what was then the U.S. Army Air Force to completely abandon the facility in 1947 and it sat largely idle for the next five decades. A picture of North Field on Tinian in 1945. US Government The U.S. military did some much more modest work to restore parts of North Field in the 2000s and 2010s to expand its utility for training purposes. The extent of this was using one of its runway areas as a semi-improved landing strip and an area for austere forward-deployed operations training. A satellite image taken in June 2023 showing the more modest refurbishments at North Field. Google Earth A US Marine Corps KC-130J tanker/transport aircraft lands at North Field on Tinian during an exercise in 2024. USMC Sgt. Jose Angeles By 2020, the decision had been made to make the aforementioned improvements to Tinian International Airport, located south of North Field, primarily to expand its ability to serve as a divert field, especially in case Andersen Air Force Base on nearby Guam is put out of action for any reason. By the end of 2023, the U.S. military had decided to reclaim all of North Field, as well. The Air Force highlighted what it described as the 'adaptive rehabilitation work being done on the North Field' in a press release last April. 'The Airmen [on the island] there are restoring over 20 million square feet of degraded World War II pavement so that ultimately the rejuvenated runway can serve as a power projection platform.' 'Our Airmen at Tinian are successfully expanding our Agile Combat Employment options to enhance deterrence, increase flexibility, and, if needed, rapidly generate combat power,' Chief of Staff of the Air Force Gen. David W. Allvin said in a statement at the time. 'They are the pathfinders for advancing our scheme of maneuver in the Indo-Pacific.' Agile Combat Employment (ACE) refers to a set of concepts of operations the Air Force has been refining for several years now that are heavily centered on short notice and otherwise irregular deployments, often to non-traditional and austere locales. Expanding available operating locations, including similar work to refurbish Northwest Field on Guam, as well as new camouflage, concealment, and deception capabilities, are also important elements of ACE. The core idea is to reduce vulnerability by upending enemy targeting and other planning cycles. A US Air Force F-22 Raptor stealth fighter at Tinian International Airport during an ACE-focused exercise in 2024. USAF Tech. Sgt. Curt Beach Concerns about the availability of large established facilities, especially in any future high-end conflict in the Pacific against China, wherein facilities like Andersen on Guam would be prime targets, have been key drivers behind ACE. Other branches of the U.S. military, especially the U.S. Marine Corps, have been developing their own new expeditionary and distributed concepts of operations for the same general reasons. Within this context, a heated debate has also emerged about whether or not the U.S. military should be doing more to physically harden bases against attack. The Air Force, in particular, has largely pushed back against passive hardening in favor of active air and missile defenses and ACE. A huge new air defense architecture is being established in Guam in line with this broader strategy. This is despite global trends going in the opposite direction on hardening, especially in China, as you can more about here. A US Air Force F-16 Viper fighter sits inside a hardened aircraft shelter. No such shelters are currently present on Tinian. USAF Rehabilitating North Field on Tianian provides not just an additional operating location, but one that is also inherently more difficult for an opponent to target. An enemy would have to devote significant resources to ensure the disruption, let alone destruction, of the facility and its runways. Andersen on Guam, an absolutely strategically critical location for U.S. air operations in the Western Pacific located to the South of Tinian is a similarly sprawling facility. Still, in December, the Henry L. Stimson Center think tank published a report highlighting the danger posed by Chinese missile strikes aimed just at cratering runways to hobble flight operations at key U.S. bases in the Pacific. Aircraft operating from North Field could also regularly move between different parking spots at the base's grid-like apron, which would make it far harder for an enemy to achieve maximum destruction by targeting just one section. In a report released in January, the Hudson Institute think tank assessed that just 10 missiles with warheads capable of scattering cluster munitions across areas 450 feet in diameter could be sufficient to neutralize all exposed aircraft on the ground, as well as, fuel storage facilities at U.S. airbases like Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni in Japan, Naval Support Facility Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, or Langley Air Force Base in Virginia. All of this also highlights the growing interest in new runway-independent aircraft, crewed and uncrewed, across the U.S. military. Short and vertical takeoff and landing designs could make use of the restored North Field, as well. Underscoring this, U.S. Marine Corps short-takeoff and vertical landing capable F-35B Joint Strike Fighters forward-based in Japan conducted a routine training deployment to Tinian International Airport in January. US Marine Corps F-35B Joint Strike Fighters on Tinian in January 2025. USMC Lance Cpl. Dahkareo Pritchett The U.S. military also uses mobile arresting gear systems to provide critical safety margins for tactical jets operating from shorter runways, including at remote and austere locations like North Field. Defense contractor General Atomics has gone a step further in proposing the adaptation of the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) catapults and Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG) it originally developed for the U.S. Navy's Ford class aircraft carriers to support flight operations on land. North Field is one of a number of other airfields being readied in the Western Pacific for combat aircraft to operate out of should a war with China erupt, and it appears to be the largest by a good margin. While they are in no way hardened from enemy attacks, having so many airfields as potential operating areas deeply complicates the enemy's targeting process and puts a strain on precious resources, notably standoff weaponry, that would be used to attack American airpower, where it is most vulnerable, on the ground.

Zelensky Decries Peace Talks Without Ukraine, Trump Says He Had H...	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky complained that peace talks about Ukraine are taking part without his country's participation and seemingly to Russia's benefit. Speaking to reporters after the U.S. and Russia wrapped up the first sessions of negotiations to stop the nearly three-year-old war, Zelensky said he wants the conflict to end, 'but we want it to be fair and that no one decides anything behind our backs.' Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump seemed to blame Ukraine for not seeking an earlier peace deal and sided with the Russian position that Zelensky should face new elections. 'You cannot make decisions without Ukraine on how to end the war in Ukraine, on any conditions,' he stated after meeting with Turkish President Recep Erdogan. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, who hosted the talks in Riyadh, originally invited Zelensky to take part in the meeting. However, both the U.S. and Russia objected, according to Bloomberg, citing sources. 'Prince Mohammed had wanted Zelenskiy to be represented at the talks but both the Americans and the Russians had insisted that they wanted to meet without the Ukrainians, according to a person with knowledge of the Saudi preparations.' Status-6 (Military & Conflict News) (BlueSky too) (@Archer83Able) February 18, 2025 Tuesday afternoon, U.S. President Donald Trump dismissed concerns that Ukraine has not had a seat at the table during the negotiations, essentially blaming Kyiv for not negotiating a way out of the war earlier. 'They're upset about not having a seat, well, they've had a seat for three years, and a long time before that,' Trump told reporters Tuesday afternoon. 'This could have been settled very easily&#8230;' Trump’s message to Ukrainians who feel let down by his administration:'I hear they're upset about not having a seat. Well, they've had a seat for three years.' pic.twitter.com/Gz4GHiawYT&mdash; Polymarket Intel (@PolymarketIntel) February 18, 2025 Trump echoed comments earlier in the day by a top U.S. negotiator who pushed back on the notion that Ukraine and European allies are being left out of this process. 'If you’re going to bring both sides together, you have to talk to both sides,' said U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, who took part in the Riyadh peace talks. 'And we’ll continue to remind everyone literally within minutes of President Trump hanging up with President Putin he called and spoke with President Zelensky. So shuttle diplomacy has happened throughout history, it’s happened all over the world. We are absolutely talking to both sides.' Waltz was part of high-ranking delegations from Washington and Moscow that met for nearly five hours in the Saudi capital to find a way to end the conflict. They came away with a four-point agreement focused mostly on improving U.S.-Russian relations that badly deteriorated after Russia’s all-out invasion of Ukraine nearly three years ago. It called for normalizing bilateral relations, creating 'high-level' teams to find a way to end the war 'as quickly as possible,' laying the groundwork for future bilateral political and economic agreements and pleading to keep the peace process moving forward. The four points were drastically different from positions Rubio held while a U.S. Senator before becoming Secretary of State. The four points of the agreement reached between Russia and the U.S. today. (U.S. State Department) The talks, led by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, were a stunning turnaround from the stance Washington held under the Biden administration. After Russia launched its full-on invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, then-President Joe Biden organized an international effort to isolate Russian President Vladimir Putin and impose harsh economic sanctions on his country. Today’s agreement opens the door to reversing that. 'Should this conflict come to an acceptable end, the incredible opportunities that exist to partner with the Russians, geopolitically on issues of common interest, and frankly economically on issues that hopefully will be good for the world and will also improve our relations in the long term between these two important countries,' Rubio told reporters in Riyadh after the talks wrapped up. Rubio's comments caused consternation among allies. The negotiations were held without Russia offering any concessions and as U.S. relations with Europe are plummeting in the wake of the Trump administration's sudden foreign policy shifts.

'There are sanctions that were imposed as a result of this conflict. And so I would say to you that in order to bring an end to any conflict there has to be concessions made by all sides,' Rubio explained. 'We’re not going to predetermine what those are. We’re certainly not going to negotiate this today or in a press conference for that matter.' Any future deal will also involve a discussion about Ukrainian territory seized by Russia, said Waltz. 'We know just the practical reality is that there is going to be some discussion of territory and there is going to be a discussion of security guarantees,' he stated. That territory could conceivably include not just land Russia captured, which is about 20% of Ukraine including Crimea, but territory it annexed from four Ukrainian regions which is even larger. Waltz said that is on the table as well. 'I think that those are things to be discussed,' he told reporters.

'I have reason to believe that the American side has started to better understand our position,' the Russian foreign minister said. That position may be just a stalling tactic, intelligence officials and political leaders told NBC News. '&#8230;intelligence from the United States and close allies shows that Russian President Vladimir Putin still wants to control all of Ukraine,' the network reported, citing four Western intelligence officials and two U.S. congressional officials. 'We have zero intelligence that Putin is interested in a real peace deal right now,' one of the congressional officials said. 'He thinks he’s winning,' one of the Western intelligence officials said, adding that Russian losses on the battlefield are not pressuring Putin to stop fighting. No way! Putin isn’t interested in a real peace deal and just wants more land? Shocking. Unbelievable. Never saw that coming. pic.twitter.com/SaGCrGbTZA&mdash; Maria Avdeeva (@maria_avdv) February 18, 2025 Meanwhile, European leaders left out of the negotiations and angered by how the U.S. is handling the process, continued to find a way to play a role. French President Emmanuel Macron is planning a second meeting, scheduled for Wednesday, to find ways to guarantee Ukraine’s security, Reuters reported. Additional European nations and Canada were invited to take part. That follows a meeting held in Paris on Monday seeking commitments for a European peacekeeping force on the ground in Ukraine to bolster any successful negotiation to end the war. The meeting ended without a consensus. Foreign troops on Ukrainian soil after a peace deal is a non-starter, Lavrov said. 'The presence of troops from NATO countries, whether under foreign flags, EU flags, or their own national flags, does not change anything. This is, of course, unacceptable to us,' the Russian foreign minister exclaimed.

The Russian ambassador called Zelensky 'the self-proclaimed Ukrainian president' and referred to his government as 'the Zelensky cabal,' saying that neither had 'a role to play in the new Ukraine.' However, Zelensky won the second round of Ukraine’s 2019 presidential election in a landslide and there have been no elections because the country is under martial law and voting has been considered logistically unfeasible and challenging after so many residents fled the war. Despite that, Trump seemed to concede that Nebenzya's point as well Tuesday afternoon. Zelensky wants 'a seat at the table&#8230; but the people of Ukraine have to say, like, 'you know, it's been a long time since we've had an election,'' Trump told reporters. 'That's not a Russia thing. That's something coming from me and coming from many other countries also.' REPORTER: 'We're hearing that Russia wants to force Ukraine as a condition for a peace deal. Is that something the US would support?'TRUMP: 'We have a situation where we haven't had elections in Ukraine, where we have martial law &#8230; the leader in Ukraine, I hate to say it, but… pic.twitter.com/JILCUKjcx4&mdash; Polymarket Intel (@PolymarketIntel) February 18, 2025 While today marks the first time high-level meetings were held between the U.S. and Russia since the all-out war in Ukraine began, this is an extremely fragile process, something Rubio acknowledged. 'Today is the first step of a long and difficult journey but an important one,' he explained, heaping praise on Trump for being 'the only leader in the world that could initiate that process.' No date has yet been set on when Ukraine will get a seat at the negotiating table. Clearly angered, Zelensky said he expects a delegation led by Trump peace envoy Keith Kellogg to arrive in Kyiv on Thursday. However, it remains to be seen whether that visit will make the Ukrainian leader any more reassured about how this peace process will play out.

Ukraine’s Black MiG-29 'Ghost' Fulcrum Showcased In New Video	Since at least the summer of last year, the Ukrainian Air Force has been flying an unusual, black-painted MiG-29 Fulcrum. A recently published official video shows the jet in more detail, although it remains unclear exactly why it was repainted in this way. The footage was posted to Facebook on the official account of the Ukrainian Air Force’s 204th Tactical Aviation Brigade. The aircraft is shown from above, as well as filmed on the ground surrounded by various support vehicles (of Soviet and Western origin) as well as members of the various personnel groups who support the brigade’s wartime operations.

There are also blue and yellow markings on the wing leading edges, the flaps and ailerons, and the tailplanes. These are to provide a rapid visual identification, to try and avoid ‘friendly fire’ incidents. This is especially critical for this jet as many Russian tactical jets also adopt a charcoal gray color scheme. The nose also has a white ‘Ghost Of Kyiv’ emblem — this motif appeared early on in the conflict as a morale-booster. An overhead view of the MiG-29 together with support vehicles, including a U.S.-supplied Humvee. Ukrainian Air Force What’s far less clear is why the fighter otherwise wears overall black, although the jet is known to have emerged before August 2024, when photos of the repainted MiG began to circulate on social media. One of the first photos of the black MiG, which emerged last summer, showing the jet before the blue and yellow identification panels were added. via X Another early photo of the black MiG, now with the blue and yellow identification panels applied. via X The new paint was added after an overhaul, which is standard Ukrainian Air Force practice, although the black scheme seems to be an anomaly. So far, it’s only been seen on the MiG-29, but more than one of these aircraft may have received it by now. Otherwise, most MiG-29s have emerged from in-depth overhauls with different variations of the ‘pixelated’ camouflage, with different shades of gray. Photographed pre-war, a two-seat MiG-29UB with the ‘pixelated’ camouflage applied after an in-depth overhaul. Ukrainian Air Force It’s worth noting that there have been a handful of other special MiG-29 schemes for refurbished jets, as well, most notably the highly colorful one inspired by the pre-war Ukrainian Falcons display team, which you can see in the video below and read more about here. It seems the patriotic paintwork was added primarily as a morale booster, reflecting the continued ability of the Ukrainian Air Force to fight against overwhelming odds, and of the local maintenance, repair, and overhaul facilities to keep the MiGs serviceable, even when facing Russian attacks. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, dozens of combat aircraft (also Su-24s, Su-27, and Su-27s) have been refurbished and returned to service to help address attrition losses and the demands for additional airpower. At least some of these were returned to action after long periods standing dormant or in storage. Photographed pre-war, a MiG-29 heads for an in-depth overhaul after a long period inactive. Ukrainian Air Force The MiG-29 fleet has been further boosted by aircraft transferred from Poland and Slovakia, which began to arrive in the spring and summer of 2023. These aircraft have retained their previous colors, with the addition of blue and yellow identification panels. While the pixelated gray colors are optimized to reduce visual conspicuity during daytime sorties, the black scheme would appear to have the opposite effect — making the aircraft even more obvious against the sky. Indeed, the U.K. Royal Air Force paints its training aircraft in (gloss) black specifically to enhance their visual signatures and reduce the chances of collisions. On the other hand, the dramatic-looking black Fulcrum finish may be more connected to the mythical Ghost of Kyiv legend — the popular accounts told early on in the conflict that suggested a single Ukrainian MiG-29 pilot had become ace in a day in defense of the capital. There were rumors, later proven to be erroneous, that the Ghost might have been Stepan Tarabalka, a MiG-29 pilot killed in action in March 2022 and posthumously awarded Hero of Ukraine honors. On March 13, 2022, Major Stepan Tarabalka died heroically during an air battle with the dominant forces of the russian invaders.Major Stepan Tarabalka was awarded the title of 'Hero of Ukraine' (posthumously) for the protection of airspace, his bravery and commitment. pic.twitter.com/8ZI7Mtugvs&mdash; Ukrainian Air Force (@KpsZSU) March 25, 2022 A photo of the supposed pilot was even posted to social media by former Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko. It later emerged that the pilot in that photo was Andrii Pilshchykov, the MiG-29 pilot better known by the callsign 'Juice,' who gave several in-depth interviews about the air war to TWZ. Before his death in a flying accident, Juice had told us: 'Actually, [the Ghost of Kyiv is] from my home base, my unit … I couldn’t tell you all the details now, but I think after the victory you will know everything about him.' Andrii Pilshchykov in the cockpit of a MiG-29, in a photo widely shared as showing the supposed Ghost of Kyiv. Ukrainian Air Force While Juice maintained that at least some details of the Ghost of Kyiv story were grounded in reality, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense has admitted that the idea of a single pilot filling this role is a 'superhero legend,' and that the story 'embodies the collective spirit of the highly qualified pilots.' Clearly, the idea of an avenging MiG-29 pilot sweeping Russian aircraft from the skies, and becoming a national hero in the process, is a potent one, and the Ghost of Kyiv myth has endured, as seen in the use of the emblem on jets and crew patches, for example. It’s certainly very possible that the 204th Tactical Aviation Brigade took the decision to paint a single MiG-29 in a ghostly black scheme to continue that myth. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Air Force does have something of a history of painting jets in less-than-standard color schemes. At this point, we don’t know for sure but have asked the service for more details. Meanwhile, despite the arrival of the F-16, the MiG-29 is still the service’s most numerous fighter, by a fairly considerable margin, compared with other types. While it began the war flying almost exclusively air defense sorties, the arrival of Western-supplied precision-guided munitions means it’s now a multirole fighter and it has been widely used for offensive missions. For these, it can be armed with the AGM-88 High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM), the Joint Direct Attack Munition-Extended Range (JDAM-ER), and the French-supplied Hammer rocket-assisted bomb. While the exact reasoning behind the all-black MiG-29 remains mysterious for now, there is little doubt that the Soviet-era fighter remains a very important asset for the Ukrainian Air Force and one that every effort will be made to keep in service via continued refurbishment, even as western 4th generation F-16 and Mirage 2000 fighters trickle into the service's tactical jet fleet. As that continues, we may well see other unorthodox color schemes emerge too.

CIA MQ-9 Reaper Drones Are Covertly Spying On Mexican Drug Cartel...	The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is reportedly flying unarmed MQ-9 Reapers inside Mexican airspace to snoop on drug cartels. The overflights are said to have built off of a covert CIA drone surveillance program focused on finding labs producing the narcotic Fentanyl inside Mexico that began under President Joe Biden. The use of Reapers, which are capable of being armed, comes amid talk of unprecedented direct action by American forces against Mexico's cartels, operations that could include drone strikes as TWZ previously highlighted in an in-depth feature. CNN first reported the CIA MQ-9 flights over Mexico earlier today. The exact size of the agency's Reaper fleet and how those drones may be configured compared to ones in service elsewhere, including with the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), is unknown. Current generation Reapers can stay aloft for more than a day at a time depending on their configuration and loadout. MQ-9s can carry an array of precision-guided bombs and missiles, as well as a wide variety of sensors internally and in underwing pods, along with other stores. There is also considerable evidence of a very close working relationship when it comes to drone operations between the CIA and the U.S. military's secretive Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), as well as Air Force Special Operations Command. An example of a US Air Force MQ-9 Reaper armed with Hellfire missiles and also carrying a range-extending external fuel tank. Air National Guard 'The &#8230; flights were communicated to Congress by the Trump administration using a particular notification reserved for new or updated covert programs that the CIA intends either to conceal or deny, a source familiar with the matter said — suggesting that the flights represent a distinct escalation,' according to CNN. 'The notifications made no mention of Mexican partners, the source said.' TWZ has reached out to the CIA and the Mexican Embassy in Washington, D.C. for more information. 'The CIA has flown surveillance drones to hunt cartels inside Mexico before, according to a former and a current U.S. official, under at least one small program that partnered with Mexican authorities,' the report added. It is interesting to note here that CBP has, at least in the past, flown its unarmed Reapers, which it refers to as Predator B drones, inside Mexican airspace in cooperation with that country's government. 'CBP also uses Predator B aircraft to perform bi-national law enforcement operations with the government of Mexico through coordination at the Information Analysis Center located at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City, Mexico,' according to a 2017 report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO), a Congressional watchdog. 'We found that 7 percent of Predator B flight hours from fiscal years 2013 through 2016 were in foreign airspace located in Mexico or 1,615 flight hours.' A pair of CBP MQ-9 Reaper, or Predator B, drones. CBP A separate report today from The New York Times does not mention the use of MQ-9s, specifically, but provides additional context about CIA drone flights over Mexico. 'The United States has stepped up secret drone flights over Mexico to hunt for fentanyl labs, part of the Trump administration’s more aggressive campaign against drug cartels, according to U.S. officials,' according to that report. 'The covert drone program, which has not been previously disclosed, began under the Biden administration, according to U.S. officials and others familiar with the program.' 'C.I.A. officers in Mexico pass information collected by the drones to Mexican officials,' the Times' story adds. 'The drones have proved adept at identifying labs, according to people with knowledge of the program. Fentanyl labs emit chemicals that make them easy to find from the air.' The ability of aerial platforms to use multi-spectral imaging capabilities to detect chemical plumes is not new, as TWZ has reported on in the past. A side-by-side example of a traditional image captured by an aerial platform and one of the same spot taken using a multi-spectral camera showing chemical plumes not visible to the naked eye. National Guard Bureau via FOIA Depending on their exact sensor configuration, CIA drones, including MQ-9s, would be able to gather other kinds of data via cameras and radars, as well as collect signals intelligence, such as communications chatter between cartel members. Uncrewed aircraft could also use sensors to geolocate emitters like radios and cellphones and otherwise track the movements of targets of interest. This, in turn, could be used to help establish so-called 'patterns of life' for a specific individual or group of individuals. That data can then be used to further refine intelligence-gathering efforts, as well as support the planning and execution of targeted raids or strikes. The U.S. military and the U.S. Intelligence community have honed the ability to use sensor-packed aircraft, crewed and uncrewed, to find and fix often hard-to-locate targets after two decades of counter-terrorism operations. These skill sets continue to be actively demonstrated in places like Syria on a regular basis. Northrop Grumman's AN/ZPY-5 Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar (VADER), which has flown on CBP Reapers and certain U.S. military aircraft, is just one particularly prime example of relevant known available sensor capabilities. VADER is a fast-scanning active electronically-scanned array (AESA) radar with ground moving target indicator (GMTI) with synthetic aperture radar imaging (SAR) modes. It can produce high-quality map-like images even through cloud cover, smoke, and dust, and also at night. Objects detected using the GMTI functionality can be overlaid on those images and changes in their positions can be tracked from one scan to the next. A view of the feed from VADER. DHS There have been previous reports, including one from The Washington Post just yesterday, about President Donald Trump's administration directing the CIA to take a larger role in the counter-drug fight south of the border, in general. The U.S. military has already publicly acknowledged an increase in aerial intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) activity on its end involving crewed aircraft in support of counter-drug and border security operations. This has involved flights in U.S. airspace along the southern border, as well as in international airspace around Mexico. 'We've &#8230; increased some uniquely military capabilities that will get after the point you make, the cartels, which are driving illegal migration, and that's primarily through airborne ISR to get more information on those and figure out how we can counter their actions,' U.S. Air Force Gen. Gregory Guillot told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee at a hearing last week. U.S. Navy P-8A Posiedon and Air Force RC-135V/W Rivet Joint aircraft have been tracked conducting these flights, as TWZ has previously reported. A separate past report from CNN says that U-2S Dragon Lady spy planes have been utilized, as well. A stock photo of a US Air Force RC-135V/W Rivet Joint, one of the highly capable US military crewed intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft now being actively used to surveil Mexico. USAF 'We have a number of intel analysts that work with &#8230; lead federal agencies to provide intelligence that gets after the cartel networks that drive the production and distribution of Fentanyl and pushes it across the border,' Guillot also said during last week's hearing. In addition, 'we do have intelligence sharing with Mexico to show them what we see.' TWZ has previously highlighted how the use of more capable and strategic-focused aerial ISR platforms, especially the Rivet Joint, already represented a significant new development in operations around Mexico. The reported covert CIA drone flights inside Mexican airspace, especially if they are being conducted without any cooperation or coordination with authorities in that country, is another major escalatory step. 'It's part of this little campaign,' Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said today in response to questions about the reported CIA drone flights, but did not elaborate. Earlier this month, Sheinbaum directed the deployment of 10,000 additional military personnel to the border with the United States to help with counter-drug operations.

YURI CORTEZ/AFP via Getty Images YURI CORTEZ 'We cannot rule out espionage because we do not know exactly what was done,' Mexican Defense Minister Ricardo Trevilla said last week about the U.S. military's increased aerial ISR activity in U.S. and international airspace around his country. Today's reports from CNN and The New York Times both stress that the CIA drones flying over Mexico are not currently armed and that there are no immediate plans to use them to conduct strikes. However, the news can only prompt additional discussions about whether it might be a prelude to U.S. direct action against the cartels from the air and/or on the ground. The Trump administration is also working toward formally designating at least some of Mexico's drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, which would expand the scope of actions that U.S. authorities could take against them. Any direct action targeting Mexican drug cartels, especially without a new level of cooperation and trust with the Mexican government, would have major ramifications on both sides of the border. Striking any target from the air in a neighboring country you are not otherwise at war is a major escalation and it's unclear if the Trump administration will end up going that route. However, collecting key intelligence, including from covert CIA MQ-9 flights, would be a first step. As TWZ has previously wrote: 'Trump’s first option would likely be airstrikes — with drones and/or standoff weapons being the most likely choice — for several reasons.' 'As we have previously reported, Mexico’s increasingly well-armed drug cartels pose a serious threat to external forces. Some cartel units are extremely well-equipped and have adopted some of the latest features of warfare. They have been using drones to attack enemies for years now, for instance.' This is terrifying.

'Cartels can also have defacto control over large areas with lots of support at the ready. Inner circles around key drug lords are among the most heavily defended and fortified positions in these areas, which makes them challenging targets. But the same ‘find and fix’ tactics that have been used to take out terrorists in the Middle East, especially with the help of drones, could potentially be brought to bear to help solve that problem. Unless Mexico agrees to their employment, they would not be operating in totally permissible airspace. While Mexico’s air defenses are extremely rudimentary, this could still be an issue.' 'Any sort of ground raid without prior authority from Mexico raises the concern that any U.S. troops inadvertently left behind or otherwise captured could be without legal protection. That’s why U.S. military deployments frequently take place with Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs) giving military personnel and civilian contractors protection from being subject to unfair criminal or civil justice systems.' &#8230; 'While far less risky to U.S. troops, the downside of relying solely on airpower is the loss of valuable intelligence U.S. forces could gather on the ground to rapidly exploit, as they did in Afghanistan and Iraq.' Details about existing U.S. military activities on the ground in Mexico, understood to primarily revolve around advise and assist and training support type missions, are limited. Members of the U.S. Army's 7th Special Forces Group (Airborne) reportedly just recently deployed to the country to help train members of the Mexican Marine Crops through the end of March. Mexico's Marines have now long been among the country's military units most heavily committed to the counter-drug fight. Whatever the Trump administration's exact plans to go after the cartels might be, the CIA already looks to have taken a leading role, including with its reported covert drone flights.

Army’s Stinger Surface-To-Air Missile Replacement Makes Progress	The U.S. Army’s ongoing effort to field a successor to the FIM-92 Stinger man-portable air defense system (MANPADS) has seen a series of successful subsystem demonstrations, with the next step planning to put the system into troops’ hands for field evaluation. The latest demonstrations as part of the Army’s Next-Generation Short-Range Interceptor program (NGSRI) were carried out by RTX’s Raytheon business unit. The need to field a replacement for the aging Stinger has been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, which has seen the United States transfer thousands of the older missiles, while the drone threat has continued to grow globally. Raytheon announced today that it had completed all 10 planned subsystem demonstrations for its NGSRI entrant over the past several months. Members of the U.S. Army fire Stinger missile. U.S. Department of Defense Members of the US Army fire a Stinger missile. DOD These successful subsystem demonstrations are a crucial step in meeting the U.S. Army’s range and performance requirements for this transformational short-range air defense capability,' said Tom Laliberty, president of Land & Air Defense Systems at Raytheon. 'We are confident in our ability to rapidly deliver the Army an affordable, low-risk, highly producible NGSRI solution.' The company provided specific details of four of the subsystems that were looked at. First of these is the seeker assembly, which demonstrated a maximum acquisition range 'far exceeding Stinger in both laboratory and outdoor environments.' Meanwhile, the rocket motor 'demonstrated the ability to extend the intercept range of maneuver short-range air defense engagements.' As for the command launch assembly (CLA) — the man-portable missile launcher interface — this also demonstrated an 'enhanced range for operator detection and identification of aerial targets in real-world, low-visibility environments.' Finally, the warhead, which underwent static arena testing, demonstrated 'precise and repeatable lethality against a broad spectrum of aerial threats.'

Brienna Tuck A Marine fires a Stinger missile from a US Navy Mk VI patrol boat. USN The remaining six demonstrations addressed other critical functions of the new missile, including tracking, guidance, aerodynamic control, fuzing, and safety. The success of the subsystem demonstrations, Raytheon says, should lead to exercises in which U.S. Army soldiers and Marines will get their hands on NGSRI prototypes and test them in exercises. It seems likely these trials won’t involve troops actually firing the missiles — at least, not yet. Raytheon said a first system flight test demonstration is only planned for later this year. A replacement for the venerable Stinger short-range heat-seeking surface-to-air missile has been in the works for some time now, as TWZ has reported in the past, with the original plan being to get a finalized weapon into production no later than the 2027 Fiscal Year. The Army issued a formal request for information (RFI) for the proposed Stinger replacement in March 2022, at which time the program was known as Maneuver Short Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD) Increment 3. While other M-SHORAD increments focused on the development of air defense vehicles, Increment 3 was exclusively focused on developing a new missile to replace Stinger. A video showing a U.S. Army live-fire exercise with the M-SHORAD system on the Baltic Sea coast of Germany on October 7, 2021: According to that RFI, 'The system must be capable of defeating Rotary Wing (RW) aircraft, Group 2-3 Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), and Fixed Wing (FW) ground attack aircraft with capabilities equal to or greater than the current Stinger missile (with Proximity Fuse capability). The system must provide improved target acquisition with increased lethality and ranges over current capability.' At least some of those performance aspirations look to have been met in the recent subsystem demonstrations. We also know that the Army wants the new missile to be faster than the existing Stinger and more resistant to countermeasures. As well as being soldier-portable, the new missile is designed to be integrated on vehicles, via the existing Stinger Vehicle Universal Launcher (SVUL). This is a four-round launcher used on the M-SHORAD Increment 1 vehicle and the Avenger system, which can be mounted on a Humvee or in a static position. The rendering at the top of this article shows how Raytheon expects the new missile to appear when deployed in M-SHORAD-based and man-portable forms. A U.S. Army Humvee-based Avenger system with the two SVULs on its turret clearly visible. U.S. Army RTX and Lockheed Martin have both received contracts to competitively develop the Stinger replacement. Speaking in October 2023, Brig. Gen. Frank Lozano, who runs the Program Executive Office Missiles and Space, told Defense News that the service expected to spend the first two years of the program developing the missiles, which would be built in a 'very small quantity.' Then there would be a competitive fly-off, with the possibility that both RTX and Lockheed Martin entrants could progress to the second phase: a rapid prototyping effort. This will see improvements made to the missiles (or missiles) and another round of prototypes. After another fly-off round, if required, the service would look to start low-rate production — sometime before the end of 2028. The original drivers behind fielding a Stinger successor included the determination that the Stinger Reprogrammable Microprocessor (RMP) would become obsolete in Fiscal Year 2023, with the Stinger Block I meanwhile undergoing a life extension to keep it relevant. This upgrade includes the addition of a proximity fuze, making the missile more effective against smaller targets, such as drones. 'We found some ways to buy time in the near term, including, for example, refurbishing older Stinger missiles,' Army acquisition head Douglas Bush said in March 2023, during an online Defense News event. 'We think we’ll get at least 1,200 good new Stingers out of that effort, and save a lot of money doing it.' A very rudimentary breakdown of the core Stinger design. Raytheon At the same time, the Army’s Stinger inventory has been in decline for some time now, with a steady reduction due to normal training and test and evaluation requirements now compounded by the war in Ukraine. This has seen the U.S. military transfer thousands of these missiles to Ukraine, which has an urgent need for air defense equipment. The dwindling missile inventory in the United States across the board has led to broader questions about the feasibility of replenishing these stocks, or surging production if more missiles are required, as you can read more in this previous TWZ piece. As far as Stinger is concerned, the production of all-up missile rounds can no longer be undertaken, with all work now focusing on modernizing existing missiles. Ukrainian servicemen with a Stinger missile launcher on the front line in the Zaporizhzhia region. Photo by Andriy Andriyenko/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images SOPA Images All this taken together helped the Army decide to develop a Stinger replacement, although it’s still unclear exactly how much of the older Raytheon system might have made its way into that company’s NGSRI offering. Meanwhile, the conflict in Ukraine has only further underlined the need for more capable SHORAD capabilities for the U.S. military. In particular, the threat posed by small drones, which is very much a reality now and only continues to grow, has already shown the need for improved SHORAD systems, and in significant numbers. The generally parlous state of the U.S. military’s SHORAD enterprise is something we have discussed in this previous TWZ feature. All in all, while many details of the Next-Generation Short-Range Interceptor are still to be revealed, the program is fast-emerging as one of the most important for the U.S. military as it seeks to optimize its short-range air defense capabilities to better meet current and emerging threats.

Europe Debates Sending Troops To Ukraine	Leaders of several European nations met in Paris today to discuss whether to send troops to help bolster any deal to end the Ukraine war and if so, what they would do there. A lot of those decisions, however, depend on what kind of support, if any, the U.S. would provide. That’s if an agreement is even reached, which is still an open question. The French-led effort to ramp up ongoing discussions about committing boots on the ground was spurred by the Trump administration last week cutting Europe out of the negotiations. They are set to begin tomorrow in Saudi Arabia between Washington and Moscow. While not giving European nations a seat at the table, Trump has suggested they could play a peacekeeping role there. PM @Keir_Starmer joins President @EmmanuelMacron in #Paris for an informal meeting on #Ukraine & European security. pic.twitter.com/qFr3NzwuUt&mdash; French Embassy UK (@FranceintheUK) February 17, 2025 The Washington Post on Monday reported that European nations could contribute upwards of 30,000 troops 'who would not be stationed along the contact line but would stand ready as a show of force if Russian forces tried to restart the war,' the publication reported, citing four officials with knowledge of the plans. 'The troops could be backstopped by more forces outside Ukraine in case they need to ramp up and move quickly.' There is ongoing discussion between those nations and the Trump administration on what assets the U.S. would be willing to provide to back up any international force and what Europeans are willing to commit. While decrying Trump's move to leave them out of the negotiations, the European leaders say much of their planning is continngent on U.S. support. The U.S. has to date ruled out providing troops, though Trump's peace envoy Keith Kellogg on Monday suggested that 'the policy has always been that you take no options off the table,' Reuters reported. So far there have been few solid promises from European nations for that effort. European leaders planned to meet Monday on how they might influence talks that could determine the future of Ukraine and of Europe’s security landscape. The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) February 17, 2025 France 'has done more advanced military planning than others and estimates that it could commit nearly 10,000 troops,' the Post posited. On Sunday, U.K. Prime Minister Kier Starmer broached the possibility of contributing troops to any peacekeeping force in an opinion piece for the Telegraph. In addition to guaranteeing Ukraine 3 billion pounds per year (about $3.79 billion) in military aid through at least 2030. Starmer wrote that supporting Kyiv 'means being ready and willing to contribute to security guarantees to Ukraine by putting our own troops on the ground if necessary.' 'I do not say that lightly. I feel very deeply the responsibility that comes with potentially putting British servicemen and women in harm’s way. But any role in helping to guarantee Ukraine’s security is helping to guarantee the security of our continent, and the security of this country,' he explained without offering any specifics. UK PM Sir Keir Starmer says UK 'ready and willing' to put troops on the ground in Ukraine to help guarantee its security as part of a peace deal BBC Breaking News (@BBCBreaking) February 16, 2025 Sweden and the Netherlands were more vague about offering to send forces. Sweden said that it would not rule out sending troops to Ukraine if necessary, while the Netherlands is 'not negative' about European peacekeeping force in Ukraine. Germany, Poland and Spain each dismissed the possibility of sending troops, at least in the near term. 'Unfortunately we are still a long way off' from such a decision, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said, according to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, adding that 'it’s quite clear that a very strong Ukrainian army, even in peacetime, must be at the core' of any solution. Poland’s Prime Minister Donald Tusk offered a similar stance. Warsaw 'does not foresee sending Polish soldiers to Ukraine,' he told reporters before boarding a flight to Paris. 'Nobody is currently considering sending troops to Ukraine,' said José Manuel Albares, Spain’s foreign minister, according to Financial Times. 'Peace is still very far away and for one reason only: Vladimir Putin.' Albares added that any discussion of troop deployments or peacekeepers would 'have to consider for what mission, who will comprise it, under what flag, with what mandate.'

'I believe that this is the first platform for the future creation of such a force — the Armed Forces of Europe, such an army that will be able to respond in the sky, on water, on land, with drones in artificial intelligence, as well as in the event of a Russian offensive,' he said, adding that a foreign military presence does not necessarily mean troops stationed on Ukrainian soil but could include air defense systems and weapons to enhance security. All this depends on a peace deal, which is far from guaranteed. While the exact terms have yet to be announced, Trump administration officials painted some broad outlines last week. As we previously reported, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth cast doubt on Ukraine’s ability to reclaim the land lost since Russia first invaded in 2014. He also said membership in NATO was unlikely. Trump later concurred with both of those stances. In addition, Hegseth made it clear that while the Trump administration wants European and non-European troops to provide a security guarantee, those troops 'should be deployed as part of a non-NATO mission, and they should not be covered under Article Five [NATO charter of mutual aid]. There also must be robust international oversight of the line of contact to be clear as part of any security guarantee.' You can see Hegseth's comments in the following video.

Zelensky has also been reluctant to give up all the roughly 20% of his nation in Russian hands. In Moscow, Russian Foreign Ministery Sergei Lavrov said that not only will Russia not accept any deal that cedes territory it has gained, but Moscow wants the entirety of four regions it illegally annexed. All this is posturing ahead of the negotiations. While so many pieces have to fall into place for a peace deal to be realized, this is the closest there has been to an end to the bloodshed, at least temporarily, since Russia launched its full-on invasion nearly three years ago.

AH-1Z Attack Helicopter’s New Long Range Missile Seen For The Fir...	The U.S. Navy has released a picture of a U.S. Marine Corps AH-1Z Viper attack helicopter with a previously unseen long-range munition armament. The Marines are known to be in the process of developing at least one new missile, the Precision Attack Strike Missile (PASM), to dramatically extend the range at which AH-1Zs can engage targets on land and at sea. The Corps sees this as key to ensuring the relevance of the helicopters in a future major conflict, especially one in the Pacific against China. Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) recently shared the image of the AH-1Z as part of an announcement about 'the Marine Corps [having] successfully executed its first live employment test of a new Long Range Precision Fire (LRPF) capability' last November. 'The event was successfully executed at Yuma Proving Grounds (YPG) in Yuma, AZ where an AH-1Z conducted [a] single launch by way of a wireless application via Marine Air-Ground Tablet (MAGTAB),' according to NAVAIR's release. 'The November test at YPG exceeded the threshold requirements with regards to position, navigation, and timing.' A wider view of the AH-1Z with the new munitions seen in the picture NAVAIR recently released. USN Though NAVAIR did not specifically name the Corps' PASM program, which evolved from an effort known as Long-Range Attack Missile (LRAM), it seems likely that what has been shown now is the first look at a missile developed through these efforts. 'This project is an Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD R&E) sponsored Defense Innovation Acceleration (DIA) project led by the XMA-ADT to evaluate cost-effective, long-range disparate effects in expeditionary and maritime environments,' according to the Navy release. XMA-ADT, which is housed within NAVAIR, has been directly involved in the LRAM/PASM work, as well as other advanced aviation projects. The 2025 Marine Aviation Plan, released earlier this month, also said that 'recently, PASM successfully completed its first launch from the AH-1Z.' It is also possible that the munitions seen in NAVAIR's recently released image are unrelated to LRAM/PASM. A slide from a 2024 briefing describing XMA-ADT's work, including on LRAM. USN/USMC The AH-1Z in the picture NAVAIR put out is armed with two of the munitions loaded one each onto the outboard pylons of the helicopter's stub wings via standard U.S. military triple ejector racks (TER) with large orange-colored fairings at their front. The Viper also has test instrumentation pods on its wingtip pylons, as well as a pair of fuel tanks under its stub wings. The missiles themselves each have an x-shaped tail fin arrangement and pop-out wings under their bodies. Though NAVAIR's image is of lower quality, the munitions also look to have a design intended to reduce its radar signature, at least from the front, with a prominent orange-colored section on the lower half of the front of the nose. This might be an aperture for a seeker, but is also unclear whether the image may have been edited in some way for operational security reasons. A look at the missile under the AH-1Z's right wing, attached via a triple ejector rack, as well as the drop tank under the stub wing and what may be a data point on the wing tip. USN NAVAIR also interestingly says that the test last year marked 'the first time a Marine Corps rotary-wing platform has employed a weapon system using a tablet-controlled device.' The aforementioned MAGTAB system is typically used by individual Marines on the ground or riding in aircraft for communications and other data-sharing purposes, including coordinating close air support, helping with route planning, and providing additional situational awareness. MAGTAB could be used to pass data from offboard sources to the AH-1Z about targets beyond the range its onboard sensors can 'see.' TWZ has previously pointed out that LRAM, at least, would require some kind of offboard cueing given the Viper's existing sensor capabilities. It is worth highlighting here that the U.S. military has also been using tablet-like devices to help with the rapid integration, in general, of new Western precision-guided munitions onto Ukraine's Soviet-era jets. A Marine riding in the back of a UH-1Y Venom armed light utility helicopter uses a Marine Air-Ground Tablet (MAGTAB) during a training exercise. USMC TWZ has reached out to NAVAIR and the Marines for more information. The Marine Corps has previously said that LRAM was leveraging an existing, but unspecified U.S. Air Force missile design. The Air Force has three projects ongoing, at least that we know about, which are centered on the development of new, more compact, and lower-cost air-launched precision-guided munitions with ranges in the hundreds of nautical miles. A number of designs with x-shaped tail fins and pop-out wings have already emerged from those efforts, though none appear to be clearly in line with the missiles seen on the AH-1Z in NAVAIR's recently released picture. A munition design with x-shaped tail fins and a pop-out wing from Leidos subsidiary Dynetics that the Air Force is testing in cooperation with the Defense Innovation Unit as part of the Enterprise Test Vehicle (ETV) program. Leidos Dynetics There is a possibility that any designs that the Marines explored through the LRAM effort, which is described as a Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) and dates back at least to 2023, are different from what service is now pursuing for PASM. As mentioned earlier, the munitions seen on the AH-1Z in the recent image from NAVAIR could be unrelated to LRAM/PASM entirely. The Navy has its own stated interest in new air-launched munitions in a somewhat similar category to LRAM/PASM. Private industry has been taking notice of the overall growing demand in this space, as well. Just in January, General Atomics teased a previously unseen air-launched 'Strike Missile' concept, which you can read more about here. An unpowered gliding munition, such as the GBU-53/B Small Diameter Bomb II, also known StormBreaker, which also has pop-out wings, could be another pathway to longer-range strike capability for Marine AH-1Zs. Published estimates of StormBreaker's maximum range vary, from 45 miles to upwards of 60 miles at maximum release height and speed from a fixed-wing aircraft. The development of powered derivatives of existing glide munitions is another growing trend globally. Regardless, extending the range at which AH-1Zs can engage their targets is a clear imperative for the Marines, especially in the context of planning around a potential future high-end fight in the Pacific against China. A new munition with a range of around 100 to 150 nautical miles would substantially increase the kinetic reach of the Viper. The AGM-114 Hellfires and AGM-179 Joint Air-to-Ground Missiles (JAGM) the Vipers can carry now have maximum ranges under 10 miles. Hellfires and JAGMs with tripled and doubled ranges, respectively have been tested, but still fall far short of what the Marines are looking at for LRAM/PASM. A US Marine Corps AH-1Z fires an AGM-179 JAGM during testing. USMC A Marine AH-1Z fires an AGM-179 Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM), one of the existing and much shorter-ranged missiles in its inventory. USMC 'I was a bit frustrated about the conversation they were having about what the next fight looks like. It was about a fight with a peer competitor and the distances we had over water with China and that H-1s were not going to be there,' Marine Col. Nathan Marvel told The War Zone in an interview back in 2023 laying out a case for the continued relevance of the AH-1Z, as well as the UH-1Y. 'I was like yes they are. Not only are we going to be there but we are going to be right beside the Marines in the field because that’s what we do.' At that time, Col. Marvel was commander of Marine Aircraft Group 39 (MAG-39) based at Marine Corps Air Station Camp Pendleton in California. He subsequently became the head of the Rapid Capabilities Office and Science and Technology Directorate within the Marine Corps Warfighting Lab (MCWL). 'Coming back to that interoperability, it’s multiple pathways and multiple waveforms. I don’t think we say kill chains anymore, because it’s not a linkage of nodes, It’s a linkage of webs,' Marvel added in his 2023 interview. 'We may very well be an enabler where you’re pushing data through us via voice and or data and we may very well be the end of that kill web or that kill chain enabler as well. We may tell someone where something is so they can go kill it or we maintain custody or someone may tell us where something is so we can go kill it like we have traditionally done. Interoperability is a huge focus for us.' 'We are going to be able to carry a Potpourri of weapons. It would not be unheard of to hang some exquisite fixed-wing fighter weapons on the wing-stub of a cobra and bring that to a fight,' he continued. 'It may be a loitering weapon or maybe an exquisite pod that does only certain things that we’re used to seeing on fixed-wing aircraft and bring that to the fight and put that down at the rotor wing level to enable the battlespace commander and the maneuver element commander to do things that they may or may not have thought they could do before.

Ukraine Appears To Have Destroyed Its First Russian S-350 Air Def...	Ukraine appears to have destroyed the first example of Russia’s S-350 Vityaz ground-based air defense system since the start of the Kremlin’s full-scale invasion. The S-350 is one of Russia’s most advanced surface-to-air missile systems and has previously only been rarely seen deployed in the conflict. A surveillance drone video released by a Ukrainian Armed Forces artillery reconnaissance brigade, named Chornyi Lis (Black Forest), shows the demise of the S-350 transporter-erector-launcher (TEL) vehicle, purportedly in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine. The video shows a column of Russian vehicles alongside a tree line, before showing the moment of impact on the isolated TEL — the cluster of launch tubes in the upright position, ready to fire means it’s not easily confused with any other Russian system. Meanwhile, the explosion and subsequent shockwave are broadly consistent with that of a M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS, although this is just one possibility. The date of the engagement is not specified, but the presence of plenty of green foliage suggests it could pre-date this winter. Video of an earlier HIMARS strike against a Russian air defense system — this time an S-300/S-400 series system — that emerged last summer: A video appeared online that reportedly shows the result of a HIMARS strike on a S-300/S-400 complex in Belgorod region of Russia.I've added a picture in the end of the video. I think it adds a little something. pic.twitter.com/VrCTITiIAH&mdash; Anton Gerashchenko (@Gerashchenko_en) June 3, 2024 'Thanks to the skilled actions of the reconnaissance troops of the Chornyi Lis artillery reconnaissance brigade, we were able to detect and destroy the latest Russian S-350 Vityaz medium- and short-range surface-to-air missile system,' the unit stated. As we have discussed in the past, the S-350 system — developed by the Almaz-Antey company — is made up of different mobile components, including the 50P6 TELs and the very similar 50P6T launcher/loader vehicle, as well as the 50N6A passively electronically scanned array radar, and the 50K6A command post. 50N6A passively electronically scanned array radar vehicle. Vitaly V. Kuzmin 50K6A command post. Vitaly V. Kuzmin The primary missiles fired by the S-350 are from the 9M96 series which can also be used by the long-range S-400 air defense system. The basic 9M96 has a range of only around 18 miles, while the extended-range 9M96D can reach targets at 75 miles, with unconfirmed reports suggesting it could perhaps have a range as far as 90 miles. Each of the 50P6 series launchers can carry 12 of the 9M96 series missiles. Shorter-range 9M100 missiles are also planned to be integrated, these being intended for point defense out to a range of between around six and nine miles. Expected to be carried in much larger numbers on each launch vehicle, it is unclear if these have actually been fielded yet. The S-350, which reportedly began serial production in 2019, and entered service in early 2020, is designed to tackle aircraft, drones, and cruise missiles, as well as ballistic missile targets in limited situations. Reportedly, the S-350 can detect and track up to 40 targets simultaneously while engaging eight of them with two missiles per target.

While sharing a high-mobility wheeled chassis like the S-300, the S-350 is altogether more versatile. With the ability to fire missiles optimized for long/medium-range engagements as well as for point defense — at least in its definitive form — the S-350 can cover the same kind of target sets as the S-300 and the Pantsir short-range air defense system (SHORADS).

Photo by DIMITAR DILKOFF/AFP via Getty Images DIMITAR DILKOFF In a previous interview with TWZ, Dmitry Stefanovich, a Research Fellow at the Center for International Security, IMEMO RAS, provided his assessment of the advantages offered by the S-350: 'Their main asset is the increased number of relatively simpler missiles per launcher, which makes it a good tool against salvo strikes of adversary precision weapons, including cruise missiles, UAVs, and guided MLRS rounds, as well as ballistic missiles,' he explained. 'However, there are too few S-350s available due to their somewhat delayed entry into service. Probably the priorities will be shifted now, but in any case, the S-350 has its role in countering adversary precision weapons under any scenario.' As we reported at the time, the S-350 appears to have made its first appearance in the war in Ukraine when evidence emerged of deployment at an airbase less than 40 miles from the Ukrainian border in August 2022. Elements of an S-350 system were seen in an official Russian Ministry of Defense video depicting operations by Su-25 Frogfoot attack aircraft at Taganrog Air Base, near the port city of the same name in the Rostov region of western Russia.

However, by early 2024, there was evidence that the S-350 was also being used on the battlefield within Ukraine’s borders. In February 2024, a video emerged showing a knocked-out 50P6 TEL, which is said to have accidentally been driven into a Russian minefield. The level of damage meant that its crew abandoned it, in an incident that reportedly occurred in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine. Luhansk Oblast, a Russian 50P6E TEL from an S-350 SAM system accidentally drove into a Russian minefield, hitting a mine. The vehicle was reportedly severely damaged, with Russian recovery crews unable to retrieve it due to the minefield. pic.twitter.com/nLbmQandO2&mdash; OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) February 10, 2024 Employment of the S-350 on or close to the front lines is something that we had predicted when the system first appeared at Taganrog. The appearance of this very modern system reflects the continued challenge posed by Ukrainian drones, missiles and guided bombs — as well as crewed aircraft — over the battlefield, with the Russian Armed Forces still incapable of gaining air superiority nearly three years after the full-scale invasion was launched. Unlike the tracked S-300V and Buk series, for example — the older S-300P doesn’t offer the same level of mobility when operating off-road, especially in the snow and mud of the Ukrainian winter. The S-350 is more mobile and better suited to frontline operations thank its predecessor. At the same time, there have been unverified reports from Ukraine suggesting that the S-350 has been pushed toward the front lines to make up for deficiencies in the Pantsir, which has also suffered notably heavy losses — at least 27 examples have been lost, according to the Oryx open-source tracking group. However, many more have likely been lost because Oryx only tabulates losses for which it has visual confirmation. A destroyed Russian Pantsir-S1 air defense system is displayed in the center of Kyiv. Photo by Aleksandr Gusev/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images SOPA Images With that in mind, anything that can further extend Russian air defense coverage — especially against drone and missile threats — is to be welcomed by the Russian Armed Forces. However, with the slow rate of S-350 production — almost certainly hampered by international sanctions — and the unclear status of the new 9M100 missiles, the impact that the system will have on the battlefield will likely be fairly limited, for now.

Aircraft Carrier USS Harry S. Truman In Greece For Repairs Follow...	The U.S. Navy aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman is now in port in Greece for repairs following the collision with the cargo ship M/V Besiktas-M this past week. The service is continuing to assess the full extent of damage to the flattop, which is in the middle of a deployment that has already included combat operations in and around the Red Sea. The Navy announced yesterday that Truman had arrived at Naval Support Activity (NSA) Souda Bay in Greece for what it has described as an Emergent Repair Availability (ERAV). The carrier had made a port stop in Souda Bay just days before the collision, which occurred on February 12 in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Egypt as it was about to enter the Suez Canal. The incident remains under investigation. The USS Harry S. Truman underway in the Mediterranean Sea on February 15 following the collision with the M/V Besiktas-M. USN Petty Officer 3rd Class Michael Shen 'An assessment team will conduct a full survey of damaged areas and develop a repair plan to be executed immediately following completion of the assessment,' according to an official press release. 'The assessment team includes structural engineers, naval architects, and other personnel from FDRMC [the Forward Deployed Regional Maintenance Center] and Norfolk Naval Shipyard (NNSY). They will be supported by ship’s force personnel and local industry partners for the repair effort.' On Friday, the Navy released a picture showing damage to a sponson on the starboard side of the stern end of the ship's number three aircraft elevator. The service subsequently released additional images, seen at the top of this story and below, showing further damage to the aft end of the starboard side of the hull. The first picture the Navy released showing damage to a sponson next to the number three aircraft elevator. USN A picture showing additional damage to the aft end of the starboard side of Truman's hull. USN MCC Jose Hernandez 'Damage [already] assessed includes the exterior wall of two storage rooms and a maintenance space. External to the ship, damage assessed includes a line handling space, the fantail, and the platform above one of the storage spaces,' according to the new Navy release. 'Aircraft elevator number three sustained no damage and is fully operational. Forward Deployed Regional Maintenance Center (FDRMC) will lead the pier side ERAV, including an assessment and follow-on repairs to damages sustained.' The Navy has previously said Truman did not experience any flooding and that its nuclear reactors were safe and sound as a result of the collision. None of the aircraft onboard were damaged and none of the crew were injured. Details about the full extent of the damage to Besiktas-M remain unclear. There have been no reported injuries among its crew. The Panamanian-flagged cargo ship appears to be continuing on its planned voyage to the port of Constanta in Romania on the Black Sea, according to online ship tracking site Vessel Tracker.

'The United States’ relationships with Allies and partners provides access to ports around the world, granting the U.S. Navy strategic pier availability and resources critical for operational flexibility.' 'While the ship is fully mission capable and the ship conducted flight operations following the collision, pulling into port for emergent repairs will enable the ship to continue deployment as scheduled,' Navy Capt. Dave Snowden, the carrier's commanding officer, also said in a statement. An F/A-18 Super Hornet launches from the USS Harry S. Truman on February 15. USN MC2 Emily Guillory At the same time, it remains to be seen how long Truman might be sidelined following the collision. As noted, the ship is in the middle of a deployment that has already included supporting ongoing operations against Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen and ISIS-affiliated terrorists in Somalia. The are no other U.S. carriers in the region currently and the time Truman spends in port now for repairs could still have significant operational impacts. 'The Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group (HSTCSG) units remain operational across geographic regions in support of their component commanders,' Rear Adm. Sean Bailey, commander of the strike group, said in a separate statement. 'Our mission has not changed and we remain committed to responding to any challenge in this dynamic and global security environment.' In addition, to the Truman and its embarked air wing, the strike group includes the Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Gettysburg and the Arleigh Burke class destroyers USS Stout, USS The Sullivans, and USS Jason Dunham. In December, Gettysburg shot down an F/A-18F Super Hornet fighter assigned to Truman in a separate friendly fire incident that is also still under investigation. Whatever happens, Truman will now be in port in Souda Bay for at least some amount of time as Navy personnel get a full picture of the damage and determine what repairs are necessary to get the flattop back on station.

Bunker Talk: Let’s Talk About All The Things We Did And Didn’t Co...	Welcome to Bunker Talk. This is a weekend open discussion post for the best commenting crew on the net, in which we can chat about all the stuff that went on this week that we didn’t cover. We can also talk about the stuff we did or whatever else grabs your interest. In other words, it’s an off-topic thread. The caption to this week’s top shot reads: NANTWICH, ENGLAND - MAY 24: The British Telecom telephone exchange inside the former RAF Hack Green secret nuclear bunker on May 24, 2023 in Nantwich, England. Hack Green played a central role in the defence of Britain for almost sixty years. It was chosen during WW2 to protect the land between Birmingham and Liverpool from hostile attack and as a location for the new RADAR equipment. The bunker went on to be used for shelter and protection during the Cold War. As relations between East and West thawed many of the UK's nuclear bunkers were sold off. The Secret Bunker is now privately owned by the Siebert family and is run as a museum trust. (Photo by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images) Also, a reminder: Prime Directives! If you want to talk politics, do so respectfully and know that there’s always somebody that isn’t going to agree with you. If you have political differences, hash it out respectfully, stick to the facts, and no childish name-calling or personal attacks of any kind. If you can’t handle yourself in that manner, then please, discuss virtually anything else. No drive-by garbage political memes. No conspiracy theory rants. Links to crackpot sites will be axed, too. Trolling and shitposting will not be tolerated. No obsessive behavior about other users. Just don’t interact with folks you don’t like. Do not be a sucker and feed trolls! That’s as much on you as on them. Use the mute button if you don’t like what you see. So unless you have something of quality to say, know how to treat people with respect, understand that everyone isn’t going to subscribe to your exact same worldview, and have come to terms with the reality that there is no perfect solution when it comes to moderation of a community like this, it’s probably best to just move on. Finally, as always, report offenders, please. This doesn’t mean reporting people who don’t share your political views, but we really need your help in this regard. The Bunker is open!

Hole Blasted By Drone In Chernobyl’s Radiation Shield: What We Kn...	Top Ukrainian nuclear experts tell The War Zone that they are concerned about the future effects of a drone strike on the radiation shield covering the doomed Reactor 4 at the decommissioned Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. While the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said there was no immediate radiation release, the massive, complexly designed New Safe Containment (NSC) structure was compromised and could suffer further damage, the experts told us. In addition, one expert expressed concern that in a worst-case scenario, the ensuing repair work could require the entire containment structure to be rolled back on tracks, exposing the destroyed inner core that the NSC was designed to encapsulate. This infographic shows the location of the drone strike on the New Safety Containment structure at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant. (Photo by Murat Usubali/Anadolu via Getty Images) Anadolu The concerns were raised after a drone struck the NSC overnight, causing a fire and breach of the NSC roof's outer layer, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi stated. While the outer layer sustained damage, investigations are ongoing to determine the status of the inner layer of that roof. Video and images emerging in the aftermath show a fire, as well as remains of the drone that fell into the facility. Emergency personnel on top of the NSC were also seen assessing the damage. Ukraine says this was a deliberate attack while the Russians say they did not strike the facility. Because the structure is so tall, the possibility exists that this could have been accidental.

We must hold Russia accountable, not appease it. pic.twitter.com/QBlSdctK6y&mdash; Maria Avdeeva (@maria_avdv) February 14, 2025 The nearly 2,000-ton NSC is a huge arch structure. Standing 360 feet tall, 213 feet long, and 850 feet wide, it was built to slide over the remains of the reactor that melted down in 1986. In the wake of that disaster, workers built a 21-story tall 'sarcophagus' to cover Reactor 4. However, it left many gaps and was not secured to the underlying structure, which could still collapse. That left the enclosure vulnerable to leaking rainwater, settling, earthquakes, as well as aircraft and projectiles. To mitigate these problems, the NSC was built at the cost of nearly $2 billion and pushed via railroad-like tracks over the sarcophagus in 2016. While designed to withstand an earthquake, tornadoes and even small aircraft strikes, the NSC was not built to protect against an explosive drone, the experts told us. New Safe Confinement diagram courtesy of European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Another big concern is that explosive shock waves from the strike could have caused damage far beyond the hole it punched in what was a virtually hermetically sealed container, the commander of the radiation surveillance platoon in the Chernobyl Zone during the first months after the 1986 explosion told us. The NSC is a complex, integrated system with many components and the section that was struck is just one part of that, explained Mirnyi, now a research fellow at the National Chernobyl Museum in Kyiv. 'The main problem is not the opening itself, but rather what will happen to the other components and the system as a whole,' Miryni explained. There are two layers to the roof. The drone punched through the first layer and officials are assessing the integrity of the second. However, the strike damaged rails attached to it designed to move cranes that eventually will take apart the remains of Reactor 4, Olena Pareniuk, a senior researcher for Ukraine’s Institute for Safety Problems of Nuclear Power Plants (ISSNP), told us. ISSNP oversees operations at the NSC. The damage will delay testing on the crane system, Pareniuk stated. 'That’s a big deal,' she exclaimed, adding that an assessment is now underway to determine the extent of the damage. Inside the New Safe Confinement Arch, December 2016 (chnpp.gov.ua/) The worst-case scenario is that future repair work will require the NSC to be rolled back on the tracks, exposing the sarcophagus. 'That is an unstable structure,' she said of the sarcophagus. 'Of course, it would be dangerous if we had to do this.' That would risk the release of radioactive material and be 'crazy expensive,' she said. Mirnyi estimated that the repair work could cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Pareniuk stressed that it was very early in the process and much more will come to light in the coming days and weeks. This is the latest in a series of incidents affecting nuclear power plants in the Ukrainian war zone. There were concerns raised when the Russians first occupied Chernobyl in the early days of the war that radioactive dirt could be kicked up by their presence and the facility itself could be struck by a weapon. Just weeks later, combat at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), Europe’s largest, sparked global concerns after a training facility on the site was struck by a projectile. The Russians later occupied ZNPP and built defensive fortifications on it as both sides traded accusations about attacks there. You can see the fighting that took place at the ZNPP in the following video.

We will know more about the exact extent of the damage and the cost to repair it in the coming days and weeks.

America’s First Broken Arrow Incident Happened 75 Years Ago	The United States lost its first nuclear weapon exactly 75 years ago when a Convair B-36 Peacemaker jettisoned a single freefall nuclear bomb before crashing in northwestern British Columbia, Canada. This was the first of at least 32 known U.S. nuclear weapon accidents, of the kind known as Broken Arrows, which are defined as the accidental launching, firing, detonating, theft, or loss of a weapon. None of these have occurred since the Cold War, but their legacy remains a stark reminder of the enormously high stakes faced by atomic warfighters in all their forms. Just before midnight on February 13, 1950, a B-36B from Strategic Air Command’s 7th Bombardment Wing-Heavy, opened its bomb bay doors at around 8,000 feet, around 55 miles northwest of Bella Bella, on the north coast of British Columbia. A single Mk 4 nuclear bomb plummeted into the Pacific Ocean; there was a bright flash on impact, followed by a sound and shockwave. B-36s over Illinois on July 4, 1949. The aircraft are very likely B-36Bs from the 7th Bombardment Wing at Carswell Air Force Base. U.S. Air Force The detonation was caused by the bomb’s high-explosive material, with the fissile core having been removed and replaced with a lead practice core of the same weight. Otherwise, with a yield of up to 31 kilotons, it would have had roughly twice the destructive power of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Led by pilot Capt. Harold Barry, the crew of the B-36 took the decision to drop the unarmed bomb after encountering serious mechanical problems in the course of a training mission. This had involved a simulated combat profile flown between Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska and Carswell Air Force Base in Texas (the latter was the home station of the 7th Bombardment Wing, Heavy). The simulated target would have been San Francisco, standing in for a Soviet or Chinese city of comparable size. The aircraft commander of a B-36 of the 11th Bombardment Wing, Heavy, prepares to fly a practice mission from Carswell Air Force Base in Texas. U.S. Air Force At the time, the B-36 was very much the cutting-edge of Strategic Air Command — the first truly intercontinental U.S. bomber, the airframe involved in the incident was also very new, with only 186 hours of flying before its loss. Soon after taking off, the bomber had run into trouble. After entering bad weather, ice began to form on the exterior of the aircraft. In an effort to maintain the required altitude, the crew powered up the engines. Around six hours into the training mission and at an altitude of around 12,000 feet, three of the engines caught fire and had to be shut down. The bomber was now flying on its remaining three Pratt & Whitney Wasp Major radial engines — the B-model was yet to receive the four additional J47 turbojet engines, two each in two underwing pods, which appeared on later Peacemakers and gave a much-needed performance boost. A B-36 on deployment at RAF Lakenheath, England, in January 1951. This example has the underwing pods with additional jet engines. Photo by Mirrorpix via Getty Images Mirrorpix Despite the emergency power settings on the three engines, the aircraft was now losing altitude. When it became apparent that level flight could no longer be maintained, the decision was made to abandon the aircraft. First, and following Air Force protocol of the time, the Mk 4 nuclear bomb had to be jettisoned, its fuze having been set to detonate at around 4,600 feet — once again, there was no nuclear material in the weapon. At this time, U.S. freefall bombs were designed to have their fissile cores inserted during flight, a safeguard that was deemed necessary for these first-generation strategic weapons. Only with a Presidential decision would a bomber take off with the fissile core onboard. A Mk IV nuclear bomb. This was essentially an improved and mass-produced version of the Fat Man weapon that was dropped on Nagasaki. Public Domain Barry later told an Air Force board of inquiry, in a testimony later published by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists: 'We were losing altitude quite rapidly in excess of 500 feet a minute, and I asked the radar operator to give me a heading to take me out over water. We kept our rapid rate of descent, and we got out over the water just about 9,000 feet, and the copilot hit the salvo switch, and at first, nothing happened, so he hit it again and this time it opened. The radar operator gave me a heading to take me back over land, the engineer gave me emergency power to try to hold our altitude. We still descended quite rapidly, and by the time we got over land, we were at 5,000 feet. So, I rang the alarm bell and told them to leave.' Capt. Barry then set the aircraft’s course to fly southwest for an ocean crash. The 17-man crew bailed out over Princess Royal Island. The crew of a Strategic Air Command B-36. In this case, the variant is an RB-36 from the 72nd Strategic Reconnaissance Wing. U.S Air Force There was a huge rescue effort to try and recover the crew and sensitive equipment from the aircraft. In all, more than 40 U.S. and Canadian aircraft were involved. A search southwest of the bailout point found no sign of the bomber, which was, at this point, thought to have come down in the sea. Of the crew, five were never recovered. It’s presumed they came down in the water between Gil and Princess Royal islands. In freezing conditions, and without exposure suits, they wouldn’t have survived long; furthermore, not all the crew had inflatable life jackets. As for the B-36, the wreckage was eventually found in 1953, on the side of Mount Kologet on Vancouver Island, around 220 miles north of where the crew had bailed out. The bomber had been uncovered during a separate Royal Canadian Air Force search for a missing oil prospector. The approximate location of the crash site, and other key locations in the incident, including Eielson Air Force Base, from where the B-36 took off. Google Earth With concerns that sensitive equipment from the bomber might find its way into the Soviets’ hands, the U.S. Air Force sent a recovery team, but they were initially unable to access the mountainous crash site. Two follow-up missions were sent and, finally, in 1954, a small demolition team managed to get to the crash site and secure or destroy classified parts of the bomber. One of the missing crewmembers was the atomic weaponeer, Capt. Theodore Schreier. With no confirmation that he bailed out, this led to some speculation that he may have decided to stay onboard the stricken aircraft. This, in turn, raised questions about whether the bomb had also remained on board, with Schreier attempting to nurse the aircraft back to Alaska. However, all evidence points to the crew having successfully fuzed the bomb to explode, dropping it out of the bomb bay, and watching it detonate above the water. A more recent investigation of the crash site suggests the same, with the bomb shackle showing no evidence that the plane crashed with a weapon onboard. The relatively intact bomb shackle among the wreckage.

Also, trophy hunters have stripped much of what was left of the bomber for artifacts. Now, with the availability of helicopters, and with less snow on the ground, it has become much easier to reach the crash site. Wreckage from the characteristic B-36 cockpit section. Diefenbunker: Canada’s Cold War Museum During a 2003 visit, an investigation team found the aft crew compartment, the rear bomb bay, and one section of the outer wing, as the only significant intact parts, with the wreckage otherwise mostly consisting of the tiny pieces left after the demolition team did their work. When the B-36 and its nuclear cargo were lost on February 13, 1950, the United States and the Soviet Union were only just embarking on the Cold War and the tense nuclear standoff that would follow for decades beyond. Indeed, at the time of this incident, the United States still enjoyed a huge advantage over its adversary in terms of nuclear capability, with around 235 fully functional atomic bombs, compared to perhaps two in the Soviet Union.

Armstrong Roberts/ClassicStoc As the Soviets matched that gap, and the nuclear stockpiles in East and West continued to grow, the demands of maintaining and operating weapons safely became ever greater. Broken Arrow incidents have led to the confirmed loss of six nuclear weapons that were never recovered, but each incident has also served as a stark learning process, leading to revisions in how U.S. nuclear weapons are stored and operated. In the Canadian context, another Mk 4 nuclear bomb was jettisoned over Quebec later in 1950, after a Strategic Air Command B-50 suffered engine trouble, but subsequently landed safely. In that incident, the high explosive detonated, and around 100 pounds of uranium — used for the bomb’s tamper, the dense metal used to hold the core together, rather than the core itself — were scattered over the nearby area. As for the U.S. Air Force, the service’s nuclear-armed bombers would soon be airborne at all times, in an alert posture known as Operation Chrome Dome, which ran from 1960 to 1968. Several high-profile nuclear accidents, including the accidental release of nuclear weapons on foreign territory, saw Chrome Dome replaced.

Between 1969 and 1991, the Air Force instead kept B-52 bombers armed with nuclear weapons on alert at all times to try to ensure that they could rapidly get airborne and escape any potential first strike on their operating bases and then be available to retaliate. You can read more about this doctrine in this past War Zone piece. A Broken Arrow event of the kind that happened in February 1950 might seem unthinkable today, but there have been some concerning nuclear incidents, even in more recent years. Notably, in 2007, Air Force personnel mistakenly loaded six AGM-129 Advanced Cruise Missiles, each with a W80-1 variable-yield nuclear warhead, with a maximum yield estimated at 150 kilotons, onto a B-52 at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota. U.S. Air Force personnel load AGM-129s onto a B-52H bomber in 2002. U.S. Air Force The Stratofortress then flew with these weapons on board, unknown to the crew, to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. In the end, the aircraft was armed with live nuclear weapons for a total of 36 hours before personnel uncovered the error and instituted appropriate security and safety precautions at Barksdale. Ultimately, human beings are fallible, as are the systems they have designed to control nuclear weapons. While the Air Force may not have been involved in a Broken Arrow incident since 1980 — and the last one involved an ICBM, rather than a crewed bomber — the potential hazards of the deadly business of nuclear warfighting remain just as relevant today.

Canada Joining Iron Dome Missile Defense Plan Would Be Welcome: N...	U.S. Air Force Gen. Gregory Guillot, the top American military officer overseeing operations in and around North America, has said he would welcome Canadian participation in expanding continental missile defense efforts, including in space. One of President Donald Trump's first official acts of his second term was to order the U.S. military to move forward with plans for a massively enlarged missile defense architecture, dubbed Iron Dome, which notably includes a call for new space-based anti-missile interceptors. Guillot also lauded Canada's efforts to expand its ability to help safeguard North American airspace through new radars and missiles for its existing CF-18 Hornet fighters and planned purchases of stealthy F-35A Joint Strike Fighters. Gen. Guillot, who is head of U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) and the U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), testified on a wide range of issues before the Senate Armed Services Committee yesterday. U.S. Air Force Gen. Gregory Guillot seen an earlier hearing. Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images 'I met recently with the Defense Minister from Canada [Bill Blair]. They are very much interested in participating. They have legal obstacles, but they assume they can jump over them. [They are] very much [interested in] participating in the missile defense system. And their best contribution could come in what way?' Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, asked at one point during the hearing. Canadian Defense Minister Blair publicly said that 'an integrated missile defense system for all of North America is the thing that makes sense to everybody' and expressed interest in partnering in some way on Iron Dome during a call with reporters earlier this month. Canada teaming up with the United States on North American missile defense is something that has also been discussed in the past. Canadian Defense Minister Bill Blair. Thomas Niedermueller/Getty Images Thomas Niedermueller 'I welcome their participation. I think the first [point] would be to buy into our domain awareness expansion, whether ground-based or space-based,' Guillot said in response to Senator Reed's question. 'Then, further down the line, if they get [missile] defeat mechanisms, see how they would mesh with our existing defense mechanisms, defeat mechanisms, in a similar way that we employ fighter aircraft with NORAD. Perhaps we could do the same with missile defeat systems from the ground.' The 'domain awareness expansion' Guillot referred to here are efforts to grow the available sensor architecture, especially in space, to be able to better spot and track incoming threats, as well as provide high-quality targeting data to attempt intercepts. Work to develop and field new space-based sensor systems to tackle advanced hypersonic weapons with very high degrees of maneuverability and that fly along largely flat atmospheric trajectories, which them difficult to track and defend against, has been a particular area of focus for years already. A now-dated infographic that still reflects the U.S. military's current stated plans for a new space-based missile defense-focused sensor architecture, as well as communications networks to support it. DOD At yesterday's hearing, Guillot highlighted existing work on new space-based sensor networks, as well as other efforts to improve 'domain awareness,' as some of the most immediate things that could be leveraged to meet the requirements of the new Iron Dome plan. 'The top priority in that, in our efforts to meet the direction of the [Iron Dome] executive order is first and foremost to establish increased domain awareness. As I mentioned in the opening comments, you can't defeat what you can't see, and the adversaries have an increasing capability of reaching us and threatening us from ranges beyond what some of our current systems can detect and track,' Guillot explained. 'So the first layer of any approach to defending the United States or North America, from the NORAD perspective, would be a sensor layer from seabed to space, systems that can detect threats from a further distance.' 'Those are seabed, ground-based, air-based, such as the E-7 [Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft], and then space-based systems for detecting, tracking, and warning,' he continued. 'Inside of that, I think we build on our existing GBI and NGI capabilities, the Ground-Based Interceptors and Next Generation Interceptors, to defeat intercontinental ballistic missiles.' The U.S. Air Force is in the process of acquiring E-7s to replace its aging E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft. A relatively small number of silo-launched GBIs currently form the core of U.S. military capabilities to actually defeat higher-end ballistic threats, and now increasingly novel hypersonic ones. New NGIs are expected to eventually replace the older GBIs. With the exception of surface-to-air missile systems positioned around Washington, D.C., and the greater National Capital Region (NCR), defense against cruise missiles and other aerial threats falls almost exclusively to fighters. The U.S. Air Force, including the Air National Guard, provides the majority of that capacity for both NORTHCOM and NORAD, something we will come back to later. A graphic offering a very general look at the fields of coverage offered by the current elements of the US military’s missile defense architecture inside the United States and forward-deployed elsewhere around the world. US Army 'Some of those capabilities are right on the edge. Others are probably three to five years out,' the NORTHCOM and NORAD commander added. 'I think within inside of a year, we could have a significant capability that could network those into a single sensing grid.' TWZ has reported extensively on recent U.S. military efforts to develop and field new early warning and intelligence-gathering satellite constellations, in particular. The work looks set to provide American forces with unprecedented persistent surveillance capacity to support strategic missions, such as detecting and tracking incoming threats to the U.S. homeland, as well as more tactical operations. The new constellations will also be distributed in nature with large numbers of smaller satellites, which will help them provide more coverage globally and make them more resistant to enemy attacks. You can read more about these developments in detail here. Beyond satellites, the U.S. military has been working to improve ground-based early warning radar coverage around the U.S. homeland in recent years. The U.S. Navy has also been pursuing new undersea monitoring capabilities with a particular eye toward tracking very quiet and otherwise increasingly more capable Russian and Chinese submarines that present ever-greater threats to the continental United States. Improving the ability of U.S. and Canadian forces to defend the airspace over and around North America more generally has already been a top priority for many years now, as well. The infamous Chinese spy balloon incident in 2023, as well as the downing of three still-unidentified objects in the skies above the United States and Canada that year, put new emphasis on this issue.

Canadian DND via Access to Information Request Via CTV News Drone incursions around U.S. military bases and other critical infrastructure in the United States, as well as facilities that host American forces overseas, including many incidents that TWZ has been the first to report on across years of calling attention to this particular issue, have now become a major factor in these discussions, as well. At the hearing yesterday, Guillot also testified at length about uncrewed aerial threats and efforts to better protect against them, as you can read more about here. As noted earlier, U.S. Air Force fighters currently provide almost all of the more general air defense capacity for North America as a whole. There has been talk about the potential reestablishment of surface-to-air missile sites more broadly within the United States, too. An unclassified map showing NORAD air defense nodes in the contiguous United States circa 2021. Green circles denote bases hosting fighters. DOD The Canadians 'were very collaborative on defining the NORAD requirements and their NORAD modernization is at the very beginning stages. We are seeing improved F-18 radars and missile capabilities already,' Guillot also said in response to a separate question during yesterday's hearing about Canada's commitments to that command. 'The next step we'll see is the arrival of the F-35 in the next two years. So they're well on the track, but we do have some immediate improvements with their F-18s.' Starting in the 2010s, the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) has been upgrading its fleet of aging CF-18A/B+ Hornet fighters. The most notable component of those efforts has been the integration of new AN/APG-79(V)4 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars that greatly improve the ability of those aircraft to spot and track targets, even smaller ones, and do so at extended ranges. The RCAF has also been working to acquire new AIM-120D Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) and AIM-9X Sidewinders to go with those modernized jets. An AMRAAM-armed CF-18. RCAF In 2023, Canadian authorities also finalized plans to buy 88 F-35As, with the first expected to arrive in 2026. The twists and turns that led to that decision were an absolute saga that you can read more about here. Canadian authorities are now in the process of refining requirements for a future national ground-based air defense enterprise, something the country does not currently have, as well. Canadian Defense Minister Blair's comments earlier this month notwithstanding, there is certainly a question about how realistic any major new cooperation with the United States on missile defense matters, or anything else, might be given the current relations between the two countries. Though President Donald Trump's administration paused planned tariffs against Canada, a trade war is still simmering and there are concerns that it could escalate. On top of that, Trump has repeatedly suggested that Canada could be absorbed into the United States, which has drawn serious backlash from the Canadian government, as well as politicians and the general public in that country. TWZ previously explored how this spat might threaten to upend Canada's plans to acquire F-35s. With or without Canadian participation, what parts of the new Iron Dome missile defense plan ultimately come to fruition remain to be seen. The costs alone to develop and field new space-based anti-missile interceptors are expected to be in the tens of billions, if not hundreds of billions of dollars. Canada also has a substantially smaller defense budget currently than the United States, raising additional questions about the degree to which it might be able contribute. Regardless, America's top military officer in charge of operations in and around North America, as well as at least some members of Congress, are clearly in favor of stepping up cooperation with Canada to better protect both countries against incoming ballistic and other missiles.

Trump Offers India Path To F-35	In something of a surprise announcement, President Donald Trump has offered the F-35 stealth fighter to India as he seeks to forge more defense deals and deeper strategic cooperation with New Delhi. The pitch comes at a time when the Indian Air Force is weighing up its options for buying new combat aircraft, with a diverse range of types already under consideration. In the past, the F-35 had widely been seen as a less likely option, based on its sensitive technologies and the fact that India operates significant quantities of advanced Russian defense systems. Trump made the F-35 offer yesterday during the visit of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Washington, DC. It also comes during the Aero India 2025 international airshow, taking place at Air Force Station Yelahanka in Bengaluru, southwestern India, and also featuring the F-35, as you can read about here.

Photo by Indian Press Information Bureau / Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images Anadolu 'Starting this year, we’ll be increasing military sales to India by many millions of dollars, we’re also paving the way to ultimately provide India with the F-35 stealth fighter,' Trump said. Speaking after Trump at a joint White House news conference, Modi made no mention of the F-35, although a joint media statement referred to a review of U.S. policy on releasing fifth-generation fighters and other high-end systems to India. Even before Trump took office, the United States was increasingly looking to India as a major arms customer. Last year, Indian arms deals worth almost $4 billion were secured by the Biden administration, including 31 MQ-9B Sky Guardian drones, up to 170 AGM-114R Hellfire air-to-ground missiles, and 310 GBU-39B/B Laser Small Diameter Bombs. Separately, India has also agreed to buy six more P-8I Neptune maritime patrol aircraft, as well as Javelin anti-armor missiles and Stryker infantry combat vehicles. India has also struck deals to manufacture the last two items locally. Military personnel inspect a U.S. Air Force F-35A during Aero India 2025, on February 12, 2025. Photo by IDREES MOHAMMED/AFP via Getty Images IDREES MOHAMMED It’s also worth noting that U.S. officials have previously suggested that the F-35 could be offered to India. Most notably, back in 2018, the then-head of U.S. Pacific Command supposedly stated that he supported the sale of the stealth fighter to India. As to how realistic Trump’s F-35 offer is, that remains to be seen, but there’s meanwhile no doubt that India is in the market for new fighters. In a statement provided to TWZ, Lockheed Martin also welcomed the statement: 'We are encouraged by the recent announcement by President Trump to provide the F-35 to India. Lockheed Martin stands ready to support these government-to-government decisions. We look forward to working closely with both governments on upcoming strategic procurements including the fighters, Javelin, and helicopters that will further empower the Indian Armed Forces with 21st-century security solutions and deterrence capabilities to address their pressing needs. This will be a huge step forward in the growing U.S.-India comprehensive strategic partnership.' A U.S. Air Force F-35A performs during Aero India 2025 in Bengaluru on February 12, 2025. Photo by Idrees MOHAMMED / AFP IDREES MOHAMMED Lockheed Martin says it has been 'a trusted and strategic partner to India for over three decades and has been instrumental in establishing the foundation of the aerospace and defense ecosystem. We’ve proven our commitment through various production programs like the C-130J, S-92 cabin, and the fighter wings feeding into the global supply chain.' Most prominent among the Indian Air Force’s fighter requirements is the Multirole Fighter Aircraft (MRFA) competition, seeking 114 new foreign-made jets. So far, candidates for the MRFA competition include the Dassault Rafale, 36 examples of which India previously acquired, under a separate program. When the 114-aircraft requirement was launched it was billed as being specifically for single-engine types, ruling out the French product. Since then, however, the competition appears to be wide open, with the F-15EX, for example, now also being offered, and the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet also in the running. Other European options comprise the Eurofighter Typhoon and the Saab Gripen E/F, while Russia is pitching its Su-57 Felon, which is also appearing at Aero India this week, and which appears to have finally won its first export order. If India decides to procure another single-engine fighter, after all, the Indian-specific F-21 configuration of the F-16 is also a viable candidate. An artist’s impression of the F-21 as offered to India. Lockheed Martin Of course, the F-35 is also a single-engine fighter, but offers an altogether different level of capabilities and high-end technologies than the other options. Reports in the Indian media suggest that a request for proposals for the MRFA competition will be issued this year. As part of Modi’s ‘Make in India’ initiative, the manufacturers vying for MRFA will need to offer local production and technology transfer. In the past, there was a plan to buy a portion of the new fighters off-the-shelf purchases and build the others under license in India — this is something that Russia has offered specifically as part of its Su-57 bid. A Su-57 after landing during the inaugural day of the 15th edition of Aero India 2025 at Yelahanka Air Force Station in Bengaluru on February 10, 2025. Photo by Idrees MOHAMMED / AFP IDREES MOHAMMED Local manufacture of the F-35 might not be an option for India, especially in the near term and it’s by no means clear if New Delhi would drop this requirement. However, the stealth fighter could potentially be offered with other offsets, including component production and the transfer of certain technologies. This could be particularly interesting for India as it embarks on its own next-generation fighter program, the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA), but it would likely still be limited to a significant degree based on India’s close military ties with Russia. Ultimately, the MRFA program seeks to field interim equipment to help address a contracting Indian Air Force combat fleet and to fill the gap before the planned arrival of the AMCA, India’s homegrown fifth-generation fighter. Like other warplanes in this category, the AMCA will feature a low-observable design, including internal weapons bays, new-generation active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, and advanced avionics, and will be intended, from the outset, to operate alongside drones as part of ‘manned-unmanned’ teaming concept.

(Photo by Idrees MOHAMMED / AFP) IDREES MOHAMMED The latest reports indicate that the AMCA is not expected to enter service until 2036, although there remains a question as to whether a potential F-35 deal could come to fruition within this timeframe. Were it to be made possible, the F-35 would offer an off-the-shelf means of drastically enhancing Indian Air Force capabilities at a time when the service is being rapidly outpaced by developments in China. It could even have the potential to completely transform the Indian Air Force and its future fighter procurement plans. On the Indian side, the government would still have to approve funds for what would be a hugely costly investment. 'There is a process by which platforms are acquired,' Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri told reporters in Washington, sounding a word of caution about a potential F-35 deal. Intergovernmental negotiations have not started and the U.S. Congress would also still need to approve any potential sale. Bearing in mind the sensitive military technologies involved, this could be far from straightforward. In particular, India is an enthusiastic customer of Russian defense products, including air defense systems. India operates the S-400 long-range surface-to-air missile system; the very same equipment that led to Turkey being ejected from the F-35 program in the past. More recently, the U.S. stance on transferring the F-35 to Turkey appears to have softened, but any such deal would still require Turkey to give up its S-400s. The final parts of the second Russian-made S-400 air defense system battery arrive at Murted Airbase in Ankara, Turkey, on September 15, 2019. Photo by TURKISH NATIONAL DEFENSE MINISTRY / HANDOUT/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images Anadolu Turkey had refused to give up its S-400 systems and had to sacrifice its F-35s (and an industrial stake in the program) as a result. Were India to be offered the same choice, it’s entirely unclear if it would agree. At the same time, while Turkey has acquired only a small number of different Russian-made weapons, India has long been one of Moscow’s biggest arms importers, resulting in a close military relationship and a significant ‘Russian lobby’ in Indian defense circles. Ahead of Trump’s announcement, Angad Singh, an Indian defense journalist and contributor to this website, also highlighted the S-400 as a major sticking point for any potential F-35 deal: 'Regardless of political winds in the United States, our case for the F-35 is complicated by the S-400 and the hordes of other Soviet/Russian equipment we operate.' An Indian Army T-90 tank, supplied by Russia, during a firepower demonstration at the Mahajan Firing Range, Rajasthan, in March 2004. RAVEENDRAN/AFP via Getty Images RAVEENDRAN In addition to traditional resistance to selling the highest-end U.S. defense technologies to countries operating particular Russian weapons systems, there is also the very real worry that these technologies could find their way into adversaries’ hands by other means. Concerns of this kind have derailed similar potential deals in the past. The United States has safeguards in place to keep sensitive military technology and capabilities from falling into Russian or Chinese hands, and India’s close ties with Moscow are likely to be a key factor in the approval of any F-35 deal. On the other hand, we are very much entering a new era in U.S. politics and foreign policy and it might well be the case that India’s relationship with Russia, and its Russian-made defense systems, are no longer seen as such a barrier to F-35 sales. Perhaps a deal could also be cut, in which India receives equivalent U.S. air defense systems to replace the S-400. While it’s highly significant that Trump would pitch the F-35 to India in this way, there are many more hurdles to negotiate before we even get to a point where a formal offer can be made. Essentially, what we are seeing now is a review of U.S. fifth-generation fighter policy for India. What happens next is very much unclear, with Indian fighter procurements already well known for their unpredictability.

Photo by MANJUNATH KIRAN/AFP via Getty Images MANJUNATH KIRAN Putting aside the F-35 for a moment, it’s also noteworthy that the U.S. government is increasing its efforts to establish defense ties with India. As well as the potential for more military sales, and not just of fighters, Washington may well be looking to take advantage of Russia’s weakened position on the international stage and take its place by forging a strong defense relationship with India. This would be especially important in terms of the broader geopolitical situation in the Indo-Pacific region, where both the United States and India view China as their main long-term security threat and strategic rival. 'In our meeting today, the prime minister and I reaffirmed that strong cooperation among the United States, India, Australia, and Japan, and it’s crucial really, to maintaining peace and prosperity tranquility, even, in the Indo-Pacific,' Trump said after his meeting with Modri. Ultimately, while the F-35 offer is about what could be a highly lucrative new fighter export deal for the U.S., it is just as much about driving a wedge between Moscow and New Delhi and helping build up the Indian military as a valuable counterbalance to China in the Indo-Pacific region.

Aircraft Carrier USS Harry S. Truman’s Collision Damage Seen In P...	The U.S. Navy has released an image showing damage to the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman following the collision with the cargo ship M/V Besiktas-M off the coast of Egypt in the Mediterranean Sea on Tuesday. Readers can first get up to speed on what had previously been known about the incident in our initial report here. The official caption for the picture is as follows: 'Exterior damage of USS Harry S.

Whether there is damage elsewhere on the ship is unknown. USN A stock picture of the USS Harry S. Truman. The area that was damaged is right to the left of the aircraft elevator behind the island. USN A close look at the area that was damaged in the collision. USN The Navy has not released details about the estimated cost of or timeline for repairs, or about whether the damage in any way impedes the ship's ability to operate. Warships, especially supercarriers, are designed to withstand combat damage, but it is unclear whether Truman will head to port for repairs or continue on as planned. The carrier and its strike group have supported ongoing operations against Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen and ISIS-affiliated terrorists in Somalia in the past few months. Any substantial time in port for repairs now would have a major operational impact. The Navy did say previously that the collision had caused unspecified damage above the waterline, but had not caused any flooding, damage to aircraft on the deck, or injuries to members of the crew. The service also stressed that the ship's nuclear reactors were safe following the incident. A picture had already emerged yesterday appearing to show damage on the bow end of the starboard side of the Besiktas-M.

Drones Over U.S. Bases May Be Threatening Spy Flights: NORTHCOM C...	Some of the hundreds of drones flying over U.S. military bases and other sensitive areas last year were likely operated with nefarious intentions, the general coordinating the response to domestic incursions told a Senate hearing today. As a result, U.S. Air Force Gen. Gregory M. Guillot, commander of U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) and North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), testified that he needs increased authority to better protect these installations. 'The primary threat I see for them in the way they've been operating is detection and perhaps surveillance of sensitive capabilities on our installations,' Guillot explained to a Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) budget request hearing. He was responding to a question about the numerous drone incursions over U.S. military facilities, like the ones over Langley Air Force Base in 2023 that we were the first to cover. Guillot was not asked, nor did he volunteer information about who was operating these drones. A NORTHCOM spokesperson later declined to elaborate. Defense Officials Testify on 2026 Defense Budget Request @SASCGOP @SASCDems – LIVE online here: #SASC&mdash; CSPAN (@cspan) February 13, 2025 The limits on defending against drones are, at best, relegated to electronic warfare countermeasures, with simply providing awareness largely being the extent of the counter-drone systems deployed at installations in the United States. At this time, directed energy weapons, like lasers and high-power microwave systems, let alone kinetic capabilities, remain off-limits. This is a glaring issue we raised after our trip to see Guillot at his headquarters in Colorado Springs last year. The threat, Guillot told the committee, is widespread. 'There were 350 detections reported last year on military installations, and that was 350 over a total of 100 different installations of all types and levels of security,' Guillot pointed out. Last month, U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) told reporters that 'an aspect of this is our adversaries, it just makes sense that they would do this.' 'When I was stationed down at the Pax River Test Center, we used to have North Koreans on the fence,' Kelly explained. 'So how do you get better video of something? You get better video from a drone over the field than you can by standing at the fence of a military base.' NEW EXCLUSIVE: What UAPs? 'It's our adversaries,' Sen. Mark Kelly says foes regularly invade US airspace (unpaywalled) @AskaPol_uaps (@AskaPol_UAPs) February 8, 2025 As we previously reported, in the wake of drone incursions like those over Langley, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Picatinny Arsenal, and others, NORTHCOM was given the role of synchronizing the U.S. military response. U.S. INDOPACOM was given a similar role for the Pacific. This new role ensures 'standardized training, response, tactical techniques and procedures,' stated Guillot. 'And if the base and the service aren't able to handle the incursion, we can bring in help from across the interagency and DOD to support and, perhaps most critically, is we can work closely with the interagency to give them the authority to operate the systems once they arrive, due to our close relationship with the FAA.' In addition, 'in the near future, I think we will have our own capabilities to bring in from NORTHCOM once we procure them to assist if the service and the installation cannot handle the incursion.' However, the responsibility for defending these installations still rests with the local commanders. Often confusing legal and regulatory hurdles limit how and when many counter-drone systems can be employed within the homeland. Concerns about risks of collateral damage resulting from the use of active anti-drone capabilities factor very heavily, too into this equation. Guillot told the Senators that only about half of the 360 bases in the U.S. - considered 'covered installations - even have permission to defend against drones. This counter-drone system from Leidos demonstrated at Falcon Peak 2025 includes a drone that fires stringy streamers at other uncrewed aerial systems. (Howard Altman) There are nine criteria allowing bases to be covered, Guillot explained. 'It ranges from nuclear deterrence, missile defense all the way down to if it's a test facility,' he said. Given all these issues, Guillot said he wants to see an expansion of anti-drone authorities under U.S. law known as '130(i).' That’s a reference to subsection of Title 10 of the U.S. Code (10 USC 130i), covering current authorities for the 'protection of certain facilities and assets from unmanned aircraft.' Airmen train on how to spot suspicious aircraft and to use the Dronebuster to block radio signals, to potentially ground these aircraft. (U.S. Air Force photo by Tech. Sgt. Jeffery Foster) Tech. Sgt. Jeffery Foster Under 130i, the U.S. military has the authority to take 'action' to defend against drones including with measures to 'disrupt control of the unmanned aircraft system or unmanned aircraft, without prior consent, including by disabling the unmanned aircraft system or unmanned aircraft by intercepting, interfering, or causing interference with wire, oral, electronic, or radio communications used to control the unmanned aircraft system or unmanned aircraft' and the 'use reasonable force to disable, damage, or destroy the unmanned aircraft system or unmanned aircraft.' The law, however, does not go far enough, Guillot posited, saying it should be expanded to pertain to 'all military installations and not just those that are covered,' he urged. Guillot also asked Senators to expand the distance from a base that countermeasures can be employed. 'I'd also like to see the range expanded to slightly beyond the installation, so they don't have to wait for the threat to get over the installation before they can address it,' he proposed. That’s because 'many of these systems can use side-looking or slant range [sensors]. And so they could surveil the base from outside the perimeter, and under the current authorities, we can't address that.' Gen. Gregory Guillot, Commander, North American Aerospace Defense Command and U.S. Northern Command hosted distinguished visitors at Falcon Peak on Fort Carson, Colorado, Oct. 30, 2024. Falcon Peak is a USNORTHCOM led counter-small unmanned aircraft system experiment and the first Department of Defense C-sUAS initiative focused on detecting, tracking, and mitigating sUAS incursions at DoD installations in the United States. Falcon Peak occurred between Oct. 19-30, 2024. (U.S. Department of Defense photos by Josh Armstrong) An expansion of authority under 130 (i) is being considered. Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) explained that he and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) introduced legislation that would 'give these commanders the legal authority they need, plus the capability required to protect their bases from these kinds of incursions and then hold them accountable for doing so.' Any change in 130 (i) authorities would be on top of the Pentagon’s new counter-drone strategy it released in December, which you can read more about here. Among other things, it builds upon a number of existing efforts, including the establishment of the Joint Counter-small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Office (JCO) in 2020. It is also set to tie into a new Pentagon initiative to help speed up the acquisition and fielding of new counter-drone capabilities dubbed Replicator 2. The first Replicator effort has been focused on getting more uncrewed systems into the hands of U.S. warfighters. Because they took place outside the continental United States, the incursions last November over four U.S. Air Force bases in England, which we were also the first to write about, were not addressed by Guillot. Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD) Pacific Target Marine Operations (PTMO) and Threat/Target Systems Department (TTSD) recently deployed small-drones over Naval Base Ventura County (NBVC), Point Mugu to provide cost-effective unmanned aerial system (UAS) familiarization and threat training. NBVC is comprised of three distinct operational facilities: Point Mugu, Port Hueneme and San Nicolas Island. (U.S. Navy photo by Ensign Drew Verbis/Released) Ensign Drew Verbis The general also did not bring up the thousands of drone sightings that took place at the end of last year that were not over U.S. military installations or sensitive facilities. Biden administration officials downplayed that, saying those drones posed no threat nor had any foreign nexus. In addition, most of the sightings were likely not even drones. However, the incidents sparked an FBI investigation and spurred the FAA to issue scores of Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs), mostly over power facilities. We reached out to the FBI today to find out the status of that investigation. Last month, the FBI told us that they had no suspects and recovered no drones. U.S. President Donald Trump has taken a strong interest in drone incursions and declared he would tell the public what was actually happening in the first days of his administration. However, his press office later claimed that the so-called New Jersey Drones were largely FAA authorized or research-related. TWZ saw no evidence of large scale drone incursions over New Jersey, with a chronic issue of people reporting normal aircraft as mysterious drones being glaringly apparent. .@PressSec Karoline Leavitt reads statement from President Trump: 'The drones that were flying over New Jersey in large numbers were authorized to be flown by FAA for research and various other reasons&#8230;this was not the enemy.' pic.twitter.com/M5Qk5exLPn&mdash; CSPAN (@cspan) January 28, 2025 For years, The War Zone has raised concerns about dangers posed by drones, and had laid out a detailed case through dozens of reports that adversaries were taking advantage of the lack of aerial domain awareness over and above the homeland. The issue unidentified aerial phenomena, or UAP, is also tied up in this deeply, which is problematic in its own right. You can read all about this here. Guillot’s testimony is a clear acknowledgment of this reality and the challenges of defending against it. Whether it spurs Congress to give him greater authority to deal with the problem is something that we will know more about in the coming months.

Mystery Tiltrotor Aircraft Spotted At Mojave Air And Space Port I...	A vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft design that recently emerged at the Mojave Air & Space Port in California, which TWZ was first to report on, has been identified. It is a full-scale technology demonstrator (FSTD) belonging to Hyundai Motor Group subsidiary Supernal. Work on the FSTD, which was expected to fly for the first time last year, is feeding into the development of Supernal's S-A2 electrically-powered VTOL, or eVTOL, design. The Air Current was the first to report on Supernal's connection to the previously unseen aircraft at Mojave. Photographer Matt Hartman had previously taken pictures of the aircraft and posted them on social media. Supernal has been working with other firms to craft the FSTD, including U.K.-based GKN Aerospace. TWZ has reached out to both companies for more details about the demonstrator. A closer look at what has now been identified as a full-scale technology demonstrator (FSTD) belonging to Hyundai subsidiary Supernal. Matt Hartman Supernal did announce last July that GKN had delivered the complete composite wing assembly for the FSTD and that the aircraft's tail booms were expected to arrive by the end of that month. A previously released picture of the wing structure, seen below, and the mention of booms align fully with the aircraft that has now emerged at Mojave. Supernal/GKN Aerospace The picture of the wing assembly does raise new questions about whether the four wing-mounted rotors on the FSTD are indeed fixed, as had appeared to be the case from what was visible in Hartman's pictures, or can articulate between vertical and horizontal facing modes. The aircraft does have two larger additional rotors in clearly tilting wing-tip nacelle pods. Otherwise, details about the FSTD remain limited, but readers can find TWZ's full initial analysis of the design here. The FSTD does differ substantially from the S-A2 concept that Supernal officially unveiled at the 2024 Farnborough Airshow in the United Kingdom. That design has four pairs of tilting rotor assemblies, two on each wing, as well as a v-tail rather than a twin-boom type. The center fuselage also has a more streamlined look with a single-piece main windscreen. The internal configuration that has been shown so far consists of a single pilot seated in front and space for four passengers in the cabin behind. 'S-A2 will cruise at 120 mph and have an initial range of 60 miles to meet typical city operation needs. The aircraft utilizes a distributed electric propulsion architecture and will operate quietly to meet community noise standards,' according to a previous Supernal press release. 'Most importantly, S-A2 is engineered to achieve global commercial aviation safety standards with a robust airframe structure that includes redundant components in critical systems such as powertrain, flight controls, and avionics.' Supernal has been targeting a first flight for the S-A2, which it also says will have a total payload capacity of 1,000 pounds, in 2026 and hopes to see the aircraft enter commercial service in 2028. The FSTD, which as noted was expected to fly for the first time last year, has been presented as an important risk-reduction asset in support of the S-A2 development plan. '2024 is a pivotal year for Supernal’s eVTOL development, marking the transition from engineering design to the build and execution phases,' David McBride, the company's Chief Technology officer, said in a statement around the unveiling at Farnborough last year. 'In addition to gaining instrumental learnings from our full-scale technology demonstrator, we will also begin prototype development and continue refining our production vehicle for scaled manufacturing in the coming months.' A rendering of the S-A2 design showing its tilting rotor assemblies in their vertical takeoff and landing mode. Supernal As TWZ highlighted in our initial report on this aircraft, the market space for crewed and uncrewed eVTOLs, as well as hybrid-electric designs that use turbines to produce electricity to drive the rotors, has dramatically expanded in recent years. The commercial aviation sector has been a key focus of these development efforts, including Supernal's S-A2. Armed forces, including the U.S. military, are also working to field or at least evaluate new VTOL designs, including eVTOL types, to perform a variety of missions. As we wrote previously: 'For the U.S. military, interest in new VTOL aircraft designs, including the active development of types with more traditional propulsion arrangements, is being driven in part by a desire for greater runway independence amid concerns about the growing vulnerability of air bases, as well as other established facilities, during a future high-end conflict. This, in turn, has led to the development of new concepts of operations focused heavily on expeditionary and distributed operations, including in remote and austere sites with limited existing infrastructure. New VTOL designs, especially uncrewed ones, are also increasingly viewed as important components of future supply chains for forces in forward areas, including right on the front lines. Casualty evacuation and the extraction of downed pilots, including from behind enemy lines, have also been presented as potential roles for such aircraft.' When it comes to work on Supernal's S-A2, specifically, the company's FSTD is now undergoing at least some degree of testing at Mojave.

Structure At Chinese Shipyard May Point To China’s Next Aircraft ...	We may have just gotten our first sight of China’s next-generation aircraft carrier, generally referred to as the Type 004 — or at least a portion of it. Construction work at a shipyard in Dalian, in China’s Liaoning province, reveals a module that is consistent with an aircraft carrier — which would be China’s fourth, once it enters service — although there remain questions about the precise nature of the object, which may be intended for testing, rather than as part of the finished warship. The module in question, apparently a section of the flight deck, is seen in satellite imagery provided by Google Earth and which first began to circulate on Chinese defense forums. The imagery dates back to May 2024 but was only recently published. Close to the module are mockups of a J-15 Flanker series carrier-based fighter and a Z-8 series naval helicopter. Mockups of this kind are frequently used in carrier development work in China, both on land and at sea. A wider view of the module at Dalian, in a satellite image dated May 17, 2024. Google Earth Well, you all know how sceptical I am usually, but this could actually be proof for the first time that 004 is under construction! @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) February 13, 2025 Provided that what appear as lines running along the module are trenches for catapult tracks, which seems the most likely explanation, this would suggest that the Type 004 will have two waist catapults, in addition to the two bow catapults. This would match the arrangement of the U.S. Navy’s Ford class and would add an extra catapult compared with China’s third carrier, the Type 003 Fujian, which has a single catapult in the waist position. This could be our very first look at Type 004 Chinese Nuclear Carrier modules at Dalian, even J-15 mockup is thereAnother 003 carrier is almost certain at JiangnanLet Dalian cook #ProjectLongwei pic.twitter.com/aKmwPFWIBQ&mdash; Húrin (@Hurin92) February 13, 2025 A view of the USS Gerald R. Ford showing the four catapults found on U.S. Navy supercarriers. U.S. Navy The module is located within the sprawling Dalian complex, the specific location being Xianglujiao, which is where the drydock for China’s earlier Type 001 Liaoning and Type 002 Shandong aircraft carriers is also located. A satellite image dated January 2024 shows that work on the module had begun by this point. Google Earth Three J-15s (or J-15 mockups) seen in a satellite image of the same location dated April 2022. Google Earth TWZ spoke to Alex Luck, a journalist who closely follows the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), for his assessment of the module. Noting that it’s probably too early to make any concrete assessment about the role of this particular module, Luck says that the Dalian location makes sense for a new carrier, with the adjacent dock already used for carrier construction and maintenance. On the other hand, as Luck points out, the first modules spotted for the Fujian, back in 2018, were lower hull segments, rather than a flight deck module, which seems to be what we are looking at here. China’s third aircraft carrier, the Fujian, shortly before it went to sea for the first time in April 2024. via X via X Since lower hull segments make more sense in terms of procedural assembly, it could be the case that this is not a production module but instead a test or demonstrator segment for the future flattop. There is a precedent for this, with a demonstrator module for the future Fujian noted at Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai, back in 2013. With that in mind, a similar approach for the Type 004, involving test portions of the new carrier, to iron out any early problems with the design, wouldn’t be entirely surprising. A demonstrator module for the future Fujian at Jiangnan Shipyard in 2013. via Chinese Internet As for the presence of the aircraft mockups next to the new module, Luck observes that these are likely not necessarily directly related to the new carrier, with the same ones probably having been used for the Liaoning and the Shandong beforehand. Previous rumors had suggested that the Type 004 might be built at a different location, namely Dalian Dagushan, located across the bay from Xianglujiao, so that too raises some questions about the purpose of the module. Dalian Dagushan is where the most recent Type 055 ‘super-destroyers’ and Type 052DL destroyers are being built but, again, we don’t know for sure that the Type 004 will also be built here. The respective locations of Xianglujiao (where the Type 004 module was seen) and Dalian Dagushan. Google Earth Previously, there had also been speculation that the Type 004 might be constructed at Jiangnan, which produced the Fujian, and this shipyard also offered some concept art depicting a new aircraft carrier design. The carrier shown in that artwork had some broad external similarities to the U.S. Navy’s Ford class and France’s future New Generation Aircraft Carrier, although, at this stage, we really can’t say what the Type 004 will look like. An artist’s concept of a future Chinese aircraft carrier. Chinese internet via @HenriKenhmann Whatever the role of the new module, there’s certainly a strong possibility that it’s related to China’s next carrier, with previous suggestions that the Type 004 could enter service sometime in the late 2020s. When it does finally appear, the Type 004 is expected to be a notably more advanced design than Liaoning and Shandong, which are by now well established with the PLAN fleet, as well as the Fujian, the country’s first domestically produced carrier, which is still preparing for operational service. Launched in 2022, the Fujian began sea trials in mid-2024 and is expected to enter operational service in 2025, according to the U.S. Department of Defense. Like Fujian — and in contrast to the two previous carriers — the Type 004 will be equipped to launch aircraft via catapults. The PLAN’s two in-service carriers, the Shandong and the Lioaning, are both short takeoff but arrested recovery, or STOBAR, types with prominent ‘ski jump’ takeoff ramps. Catapults offer manifold advantages, especially when it comes to launching aircraft at higher gross weights, which translates to larger fuel and ordnance loads. They can also generally accommodate a wider array of aircraft types, too. This includes larger and slower designs, like the still-in-development KJ-600 carrier-based airborne early warning and control aircraft, as well as smaller ones, such as drones. A satellite view of a prototype KJ-600. via Chinese Internet Another satellite image shows a KJ-600 prototype in the green primer paint now frequently seen on Chinese naval aircraft. via Chinese internet Presumably, the Type 004 will have an advanced electromagnetic aircraft launch system (EMALS), provided it proves to be successful on the Fujian. Otherwise, this type of equipment is currently only in use with the U.S. Navy. Aside from the KJ-600, the air wing for the new carrier will likely include the J-35 stealth fighter, supported by advanced versions of the J-15 multirole fighter. The carrier is also likely to host various drones, such as navalized versions of the GJ-11 Sharp Sword uncrewed combat aerial vehicle (UCAV), plus helicopters. One of the first prototypes of the carrier-based J-35 stealth fighter. via Chinese internet There have long been reports that the Type 004 will be a nuclear-powered vessel, which would give it effectively unlimited range and help meet the power-generation demands of ever-improving sensors, other mission systems, and possibly directed-energy weapons. At this stage, that remains unconfirmed but would certainly be in line with the PLAN’s expanding carrier ambitions. As well as its aircraft carriers, China is meanwhile also working to introduce a number of very large big-deck amphibious assault ships, referred to as the Type 076. Each will feature at least one electromagnetic catapult that is expected to be primarily used to launch drones, as you can read more about here. In its latest assessment of Chinese military power, the Pentagon doesn’t explicitly mention the Type 004, but does state that the PLAN is 'in the beginning stages of operating its multi-carrier force.' It also notes that the Fujian is just the first warship within a 'nextgeneration of carriers' that will be characterized by 'greater endurance and an electromagnetic catapult launch system, making them capable of launching various types of specialized fixed-wing aircraft for missions, such as airborne early warning and electronic warfare. This will increase the striking power of a potential PLAN carrier battle group when deployed to areas beyond the PRC’s immediate periphery.' While the PLAN’s carrier force is still clearly outmatched by the U.S. Navy’s fleet of 11 active nuclear-powered supercarriers, China is already benefiting from having multiple carriers to draw on, and this advantage is set to become more pronounced in the years to come. As the Chinese military buildup continues, the Type 004 future aircraft carrier is clearly a program to watch.
