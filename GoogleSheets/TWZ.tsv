Russians Advancing On Kharkiv Region City Ukraine Liberated In 20...	While most of the heavy fighting in Ukraine is concentrated in the Donetsk region, Russia continues to push toward the city of Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast. Located about 60 miles east of Kharkiv City, it is a regional administrative headquarters and sits astride a key railway. Russian forces are now less than five miles to the northeast and less than 10 miles to the southeast. The Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff reported 20 battles in the area on Friday and claimed its forces repelled Russian advance attempts on the nearby towns of Sinkivka, Glushkivka, Lozova, Stelmakhivka and Kolisnikivka. The Russian Defense Ministry (MoD) said units of its Zapad Group of Forces 'took more advantageous lines and positions as well as inflicted losses on manpower and hardware of the 3rd Tank Brigade and the 14th, 44th, 53rd, 63rd, 66th Mechanized Brigades.'

(DeepState) A Ukrainian drone unit said it repelled a large mechanized attack in the Pischany district, about 12 miles southeast of Kupiansk. That town is in the middle of a Russian pincer movement approaching Kupiansk from the north and south. 'About 50 units of Russian armored vehicles with amphibious assault were moving in the direction of Kolesnikivka and Kruglyakivka,' Yurii Fedorenko, commander of the ACHILLES assault battalion of the 92nd Assault Brigade, claimed on Telegram. A video released by the unit shows about two dozen Russian armored vehicles and trucks being destroyed by first-person view (FPV) drones. 92nd Brigade repels yesterdays big Russian attack on the Kup'yans'k front.

In August we reported that city officials evacuated more than 11,000 people. On Friday, Kharkiv Regional State Administrator Oleg Synegubov stated on Telegram that schools, apartment buildings, and homes were destroyed or damaged by Russian glide bombs, artillery, and drones. A home in the Kupiansk region burns after a Russian attack. (Oleg Synegubov Telegram) The Russian offensive in Kharkiv has created a cascading series of problems for Ukraine. It rushed troops from the Donbas to defend it, leaving that region more exposed. Back in September 2022, Ukraine liberated Kupiansk as part of its stunning and successful offensive in that region. It was a high point for the nation a half-year after Russia launched its all-out invasion. While its fall does not appear imminent, the fact that Kupiansk is again under siege is another troubling sigh of Ukraine's hard-fought gains being eroded. The Latest Elsewhere on the battlefield, Russian forces continue to push forward in eastern Ukraine, where towns like Pokrovsk, Toretsk and Vuhledar remain in peril. According to the Institute for the Study of War‚Äôs (ISW) latest assessment, Russian forces ' recently advanced east and southeast of Pokrovsk amid continued offensive operations near Pokrovsk on September 26.' Ukrainian forces 'maintain positions in Vuhledar and Kostyantynivka amid continued Russian offensive operations southwest of Donetsk City on September 26. The Ukrainian brigade defending in Vuhledar reported that Ukrainian forces are maintaining positions in the settlement in response to recent Western reporting to the contrary.' In Kharkiv Oblast, Russian forces 'recently reportedly made marginal advances north of Kharkiv City, but there were no confirmed changes to the frontline' in the northern part of that region on September 26. There were no gains made in Luhansk Oblast either. In Russia‚Äôs Kursk region, 'Ukrainian forces continued ground assaults in Glushkovsky Raion, Kursk Oblast on September 26 but did not make any confirmed advances.'

'In theory, Ukraine remains determined to reclaim all its lost territory, restoring the borders it inherited when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991,' the publication explained. 'That would entail the reconquest not only of the Russian-occupied bits of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhia provinces, but also of Crimea, which Russia seized in 2014. But that is far out of reach militarily. In practice, the war has become one of attrition, with both sides hoping they can outlast the other, or at least fend the other off for long enough to avoid being forced into a disadvantageous peace agreement.'

During a pre-meeting press conference, Trump once again said he could end the war in Ukraine and that he has good relations with both Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Standing next to Zelensky, Trump said he‚Äôs ready to work out a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, CNN noted, emphasizing his good relationship with Putin. 'So, we‚Äôre going to sit down (to) just discuss it, and if we have a win, I think long before I, before January 20, before I would take the presidency ‚Äì it‚Äôs January 20 ‚Äì but long before that, I think that we can work out something that‚Äôs good for both sides. It‚Äôs time,' Trump added. 'By the way, the president (Zelensky) knows that too. He wants to get something done. He doesn‚Äôt want to do this.' 'I think we have common view that the war in Ukraine has to be stopped, and Putin can‚Äôt win, and Ukraine has to prevail, and I want to discuss with you the details about that,' Zelensky said. The meeting took place even after Trump, openly skeptical about providing additional aid to Ukraine, mocked Zelensky. While Zelensky has yet to release the plan, it is said to include requests for ongoing Ukrainian security guarantees as well for additional long-range weapons and the permission to use them deep in Russia. After the meeting, Zelensky expressed gratitude toward Trump, calling their meeting 'very productive.' He added that the two men 'thoroughly reviewed' the situation in Ukraine and the consequences of the war for Ukrainians. I had a very productive meeting with @realDonaldTrump.

During a meeting of the Russian Federation Security Council standing conference on nuclear deterrence, Putin announced a draft proposal for changes to his country‚Äôs nuclear doctrine. It includes the possibility of using nuclear weapons in the event of a massive launch of non-nuclear weapons against Russia. He did not mention Ukraine but inferred that actions taken by Kyiv and its allies could push Moscow over the nuclear threshold. 'The updated version of the document is supposed to regard an aggression against Russia from any non-nuclear state but involving or supported by any nuclear state as their joint attack against the Russian Federation,' Putin said. The proposal also 'states clearly the conditions for Russia‚Äôs transition to the use of nuclear weapons.' Under the plan, Russia will consider using nuclear weapons 'once we receive reliable information about a massive launch of air and space attack weapons and their crossing our state border. I mean strategic and tactical aircraft, cruise missiles, UAVs, hypersonic and other aircraft.' Russia reserves 'the right to use nuclear weapons in the event of aggression against Russia and Belarus as a member of the Union State. All these issues have been agreed upon with the Belarusian side and the President of Belarus. Including the case when the enemy, using conventional weapons, creates a critical threat to our sovereignty.' 'In conclusion,' Putin said, ' I will note that all the updates have been deeply calibrated and are measured against contemporary military threats and risks to the Russian Federation.' Putin suggests changes to Russia's nuclear doctrine.'An aggression by a non-nuclear state with the participation of a nuclear state is proposed to be considered as their joint attack on Russia,' Putin said during a Security Council meeting. The Kyiv Independent (@KyivIndependent) September 25, 2024 One analyst suggested that Putin's announcement falls between 'cheap talk' and 'state-sponsored rhetoric.'

Plans To Axe Special Operations Surveillance Planes Come Under Th...	How U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) expects to fill the capability and capacity gaps that will be created by the planned retirement of U-28A Draco and Beechcraft King Air-based surveillance aircraft is coming under increasing scrutiny. SOCOM and U.S. Air Force officials have repeatedly stressed that while ditching the U-28As and King Airs will free up resources to help field its new OA-1K Sky Warden light attack aircraft, the latter is not a replacement for the former. The Government Accountability Office (GAO), a Congressional watchdog, confirmed to The War Zone earlier this week that it is currently conducting a classified review of SOCOM's decision to divest the U-28As and King Air-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft, the latter of which are often referred to collectively as MC-12s. This is separate from GAO's already extensive and still ongoing assessments of the Armed Overwatch program that led to the OA-1K, a single turboprop-engined light attack aircraft based on the Air Tractor AT-802 crop duster. The OA-1K Sky Warden. L3Harris 'SOCOM told us that their decisions about Armed Overwatch occurred separate from their decisions to divest of existing aircraft,' a GAO spokesperson told The War Zone. 'We are separately conducting a classified assessment of SOCOM‚Äôs process for how it decided to divest of ISR aircraft.' 'SOCOM plans to divest two ISR platforms. Subsequently, some personnel and resources from the platforms will be used to support Armed Overwatch,' GAO said in an unclassified summary of its assessments to date of the Armed Overwatch program that was released earlier this month. 'However, GAO found that SOCOM has not taken steps to plan for, or add, critical ISR capabilities provided by soon-to-be divested aircraft. Also, SOCOM has not addressed risks associated with the loss of these capabilities if the new aircraft does not provide them.' A U-28A Draco. USAF MC-12W Liberty aircraft like the one seen here are among the ISR-configured Beechcraft King Air variants currently in service across the U.S. special operations community. USAF The exact sizes of the current U-28A and King Air ISR fleets are not entirely clear. In a report published in December 2023, GAO said that close to 40 U-28As and around 15 ISR-configured King Airs remained in service. The Draco is a militarized version of the Pilatus PC-12M single-engine turboprop, while the members of the Beechcraft King Air family are twin-engine turboprop types. U-28As and MC-12s carry different, but similar mixes of sensors, including electro-optical and infrared video cameras and signals intelligence (SIGINT) suites. A graph showing the OA-1K (Armed Overwatch), MC-12, and U-28 fleet sizes as of Fiscal Year 2023 and how they are expected to change by the end of the decade. GAO There is also uncertainty now around the expected size of the OA-1K fleet. In its Fiscal Year 2025 budget proposal released earlier this year, SOCOM revealed plans to shrink the total Sky Warden purchases down to 62 from 75. 'Our requirement still remains 75 [OA-1Ks] based on what we've determined,' Air Force Lt. Gen. Michael Conley, head of Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), told The War Zone and others at a media roundtable on the sidelines of the Air & Space Forces Association's main annual conference last week. 'I think it still provides a cost-effective close air support platform, which is one of the missions that it was designed for. It's still going to provide an ISR capability.' The OA-1K can carry camera turrets and other sensors in pods under its wings, but these will only provide limited capabilities compared to the integrated ISR suites found on the U-28A and King Air variants. As already noted, SOCOM and the Air Force have now made clear that they do not see the Sky Warden as a replacement capability-wise for any existing crewed fixed-wing surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft. At the annual SOF Week conference in May, SOCOM officials said that they working on new aerial ISR requirements that could lead to more direct successor to the U-28A and King Airs.

A core underlying issue in all of this is the broader shift in focus across the U.S. military to preparing for future high-end fights, especially a potential one against China in the Pacific, after decades of counter-terrorism and other lower-intensity missions. The U.S. special operations community, which had been at the forefront of operations during the Global War on Terror era, is at a particular watershed moment now. This has had a direct impact on planning around the OA-1K and SOCOM's crewed fixed-wing ISR fleets, as well as other special operations unique aircraft like the AC-130J Ghostrider gunship. 'From when OA-1K was conceptualized and decided on until now, the world‚Äôs changed a little bit,' Lt. Gen. Conley said last week. 'But as we move forward, I think there‚Äôs opportunity to look at, again, some novel mission sets. ‚Ä¶how quick can we get the wings on and off it so we could use it in some sort of crisis response, if we needed to? Where does the role of SIGINT [signals intelligence], or ELINT [electronic intelligence] or‚Ä¶ some sort of ISR collect [factor in] there. I think there‚Äôs opportunity for that. Again, not anything we‚Äôve committed to yet.' When it comes to discussions about crewed fixed-wing ISR capabilities, especially in a world full of ever-more capable and steadily proliferating air defense threats, this broader debate extends beyond just the U.S. special operations community. The U.S. Army has also been divesting significant numbers of turboprop surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft, fleets that had ballooned in size in the past 15 years to support operations in places like Iraq and Afghanistan. That service is now looking at a new mix of aerial ISR capabilities that includes modified business jets and high-altitude balloons. King Air-based types like the MC-12S Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (EMARSS) seen here are among the turboprop ISR aircraft the US Army has also been divesting in recent years. US Army AFSOC's Conley also stressed at the AFA conference this year that while the primary focus of America's armed forces now is being ready to execute major combat operations against a near-peer opponent, this doesn't mean that lower-end missions will evaporate. A central argument behind the Armed Overwatch program has always been the value of having cheaper alternatives to tactical combat jets, bombers, and other aircraft for conducting light attack and ISR missions in permissive environments. A concept of operations like this also frees up other aircraft for higher-priority missions, or just allows them to not have to fly as much, helping to reduce maintenance and logistics costs. Aircraft like the Sky Warden have the additional benefit of being able to operate with minimal footprints at far-flung locations closer to their mission areas without the need for already heavily in-demand tanker support. That proximity also helps when it comes to time on station, which has its own cost implications. The price to operate fast jets and other aircraft for bases further afield to conduct short-endurance sorties can quickly add up. 'I tell my team every day [that] the Pacific is incredibly important to us for all the reasons ‚Äì you know, Secretary [of the Air Force Frank Kendall has put emphasis on] China, China, China ‚Äì we get it,' the head of AFSOC explained. 'But we've also got a rest of world mission that I'm responsible for, as well.' 'We still have a global mission. &#8230; I don't think we're done in CENTCOM,' he continued, referring to U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. military operations across the Middle East, which is currently in the throes of a number of major crises in which the U.S. military is embroiled to differing degrees. 'And I think there's probably some disconnects in how we analyze what the future fight will look like.' Lt. Gen. Conley also noted that his command is 'still digesting' the latest of GAO's assessments on OA-1K and that there is 'some reconciliation we still need to do' with regard to the Congressional watchdog's work to date. AFSOC, as well as SOCOM, will now also have to do the same with regard to whatever comes out of GAO's separate review of the plans to shed the U-28As and King Airs, which may have new impacts on U.S. special operations aviation plans going forward.

Israel Executes Massive Bunker Buster Strike On Hezbollah Command...	Beirut has been rocked by huge explosions, with Israel confirming that it carried out airstrikes against Hezbollah‚Äôs main military headquarters in the Lebanese capital. Information is still emerging, but Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah is said to have been the target, while this afternoon‚Äôs raids were the biggest to hit Beirut since the start of the current conflict in the Middle East, almost a year ago. In Beirut this afternoon, a series of explosions were heard across the city, leaving multiple huge plumes of dark smoke. Smoke was even visible from the city of Batroun, roughly an hour‚Äôs drive north of the Lebanese capital.

According to the Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Manar TV, four buildings were destroyed by the airstrikes, while a report from AFP mentions the destruction of six buildings. While emergency responders are already on the scene, there are so far no official reports of the number of casualties.

The Last Viper Commander: Dutch Squadron Boss On Today‚Äôs Retireme...	After 45 years of service, including multiple combat deployments, the F-16 was formally retired today by the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF). Ahead of today‚Äôs flight and retirement ceremony, TWZ spoke to Lt. Col. Patrick 'Naish' Vreeburg, the commander of 302 Squadron, the final RNLAF F-16 operator, who reflected on the type‚Äôs service ‚Äî and what comes next. As for the Dutch F-16s, these will almost certainly see more combat again before too long, with two dozen refurbished jets to be transferred to Ukraine. Lt. Col.

F-35 Lightning II (@thef35) September 26, 2024 The RNLAF bid 'Farewell Falcon' to the F-16 today, with a ceremony at the final operational base, Volkel, in the south of the Netherlands. From here, seven of the last Dutch F-16s (and one Belgian) took off for a farewell flight, taking them over key locations associated with the Viper‚Äôs long career in the country. Among the places flown over were the Netherlands Ministry of Defense in the Hague and the Air Force Headquarters in Breda, as well as other bases where the F-16 was previously based. Brig. Gen. Marcel ‚ÄòBo‚Äô van Egmond, the head of RNLAF Air Combat Command (in the cockpit), and Lt. Gen.

RNLAF/YouTube screencap First off, it‚Äôs worth recalling the key facts and milestones associated with the F-16 in Dutch service. The Netherlands was one of the first four European Participating Air Forces (EPAF) to sign up for the F-16 as part of the so-called ‚ÄòSale of the Century,‚Äô primarily to replace its aging F-104 Starfighter fleet. Fly away with Jaws. During the Cold War the Royal Netherlands Airforce had 213 F16‚Äôs. Today the reliable F16 is replaced with the F-35 and makes its last flight. The location of this film is Leeuwarden Airbase (1981). #FarewellF16 pic.twitter.com/4tJTknKoea&mdash; Klaas Meijer (@klaasm67) September 27, 2024 Ultimately, the Dutch bought 213 examples of the F-16A/B versions, some of which were assembled locally, by Fokker. The first order was for 102 F-16s, comprising 80 single-seat F-16As and 22 two-seat F-16Bs. The first Dutch-built F-16 took to the air on May 3, 1979, and an initial delivery to the RNLAF followed in June of the same year. An F-16AM operated by the U.S.-based RNLAF training unit, from Luke Air Force Base, Arizona. Frank Cr√©bas In December 1983, the Dutch government approved plans to buy another 111 F-16s (97 F-16As and 14 F-16Bs), the last of which was rolled out of the Fokker production facility in February 1992. By then, however, the Cold War was over and the security landscape in Europe looked very different. In 1993 it was decided that only 138 of the jets would pass through the Mid-Life Update (MLU) program, rather than the 170 originally planned. The MLU was completed in 2003, the same year in which it was announced that the fleet would be reduced again, by 25 percent. The steady downsizing of the Dutch Viper fleet provided opportunities for other operators. Beginning in 2005, Jordan acquired six F-16BMs, while Chile acquired a first batch of 18 jets (11 F-16AMs and seven F-16BMs) in the same year, followed by another batch of 18 single-seaters in 2008. An F-16AM from 312 Squadron over the North Sea. Frank Cr√©bas The Dutch first took the F-16 to war over the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s, under Operations Joint Falcon and Allied Force. During the latter campaign, on April 4, 1999, a Dutch F-16 shot down a Serbian MiG-29 Fulcrum fighter with an AIM-120 AMRAAM missile, for the first RNLAF aerial kill since World War II. Dutch F-16s also struck Serbian ground targets in the same operation, including using AGM-65G Maverick air-to-ground missiles. Subsequently, RNLAF F-16s flew missions over Afghanistan under Operation Enduring Freedom, with the jets initially based in Kyrgyzstan. Dutch F-16s also took part in the NATO air campaign over Libya, followed by counter-IS missions in the Middle East. Regular deployments were also made to the Baltics as part of NATO‚Äôs Baltic Air Policing rotational mission, to defend the airspace of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. While the F-16 was originally acquired by the RNLAF with the expectation that it would fly short-range air defense and battlefield interdiction with ‚Äòdumb‚Äô munitions during a war with the Warsaw Pact, the post-Cold War world put very different demands on the jet and its operators. An RNLAF F-16 driver prepares for a night mission. Frank Cr√©bas Nevertheless, the F-16 excelled at out-of-area operations and extended deployments far from the Netherlands. On more than one occasion, for example during the operations in Afghanistan and Iraq/Syria, a political decision was made and, only a couple of days later, Dutch F-16s would be flying in theater. With such an illustrious career behind it, it‚Äôs no surprise that Lt. Col. Vreeburg has some mixed feelings about the F-16‚Äôs retirement. 'Of course, it‚Äôs a big moment,' he told TWZ. 'After 45 years of operating the F-16 in the Royal Netherlands Air Force and a lot of deployments over the last 20-plus years, and very important tasks before that during the Cold War. But we need now to focus on our people and our assets, to transition to the F-35 to provide a credible deterrence.' Vreeburg admitted that his job as commander of 312 Squadron has meant that he‚Äôs been almost too busy to reflect on the retirement of the F-16, a jet that has played a huge part in his service career, its cockpit providing his ‚Äòoffice‚Äô for the last 23 years. An RNLAF F-16AM configured for air defense ejects an infrared flare. Frank Cr√©bas 'I‚Äôve been on 10 deployments with the F-16,' Vreeburg explained. 'We had a lot of adventures together, and it flies‚Ä¶ like heaven. It really flies like a razor blade. Almost as soon as you even think about turning, it already goes. I don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôs going to be on the F-35. I‚Äôm lucky that I‚Äôm transitioning to the F-35 so I will keep flying.' The first F-35s arrived at Leeuwarden on October 31, 2019, and the RNLAF now has 40 of the 52 units already ordered, with more planned. That changeover is something that Vreeburg likened to trading in your first car for a new model. 'You had a lot of adventures with it, and now it‚Äôs served its purpose‚Ä¶ it cannot bring you any more to where you need to go, and so you need something else, but you keep fond memories of it.' Of those 10 combat deployments, Vreeburg recalled them as being 'all memorable in their own way. The first one, and then the first one as a flight lead. And then the first deployment that flew out of Afghanistan instead of from Kyrgyzstan into Afghanistan. Then you had Libya. Then you had Iraq. I think one of the most memorable of my deployments to Kandahar was when we had the Battle of Chora, when we, together with the Netherlands Army, went onto the offensive to take that valley back. At one point we had the whole battle group from the Netherlands Army, with all six aircraft, even including the spares, all above that valley at the same time, combating the Taliban. So that was one of the most memorable deployments I had.' With Smokewinders on the wingtips, an F-16AM flies over some typical Dutch countryside. Frank Cr√©bas While combat deployments finished with the end of the Operation Inherent Resolve rotations, until the beginning of this year, RNLAF F-16s were still undertaking some quick reaction alert (QRA) air defense duties, of Benelux (Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg) airspace, Vreeburg explained. 'We still did one month of standby duty, 24/7, with a small group of pilots and maintainers. We had a small group of aircraft to perform that mission. We also still had the DCA [dual-capable aircraft], our nuclear mission. At the end of February, we transitioned the QRA task to the F-35 and at the end of May we transitioned the DCA task also to the F-35.' An RNLAF F-16AM flies alongside the first Dutch F-35A. Frank Cr√©bas Vreeburg continued: 'After that, we focused still on investing in our people. We still had some flight lead upgrades going on and we did some mission commander upgrades. We also did a deployment just before the summer break to Norway, where we flew support for the weapon instructor course, as ‚Äòred air.‚Äô We used that deployment to train our people in deploying and operating from an unfamiliar airfield. We finished up the last flight lead upgrade a couple of weeks ago, and meanwhile, besides that, we were mainly, especially since the summer break, flying support for the F-35 as red air, but also as blue air, because they also need entities to protect in their training. We could also use that in our flight lead upgrades or for our own training because all of our guys are transitioning to the F-35, so we have to keep them smart ‚Äî or make them even smarter. Although it‚Äôs another aircraft, 90 percent of the skills you learn are also usable.' An RNLAF F-16AM accompanies an RNLAF F-35A. Frank Cr√©bas A contractor-operated A-4K from Draken International, an RNLAF F-16AM, and an RNLAF F-35A. Frank Cr√©bas So far, Vreeburg hasn‚Äôt flown an F-35, but he already knows what he thinks he might miss once he transitions to the fifth-generation fighter. 'In the F-16, under the canopy, you sit almost on top of the aircraft, you have almost restricted vision all around you. And it also flies a bit smoother, although that depends, right? If you have tanks, jamming pods, and weapons on your wings, then it flies totally differently than only with a centerline tank and a couple of missiles. In the F-35, almost everything is internal, most of the time, so it‚Äôs almost apples and oranges. But I‚Äôm hearing it‚Äôs not such smooth flying. The aerodynamics are different; the F-35 has a different wing shape, and you have the boundary layer that rumbles through the aircraft, which you don‚Äôt have on the F-16.' An F-16BM assigned to the U.S.-based RNLAF training unit rips through a valley at low level. Frank Cr√©bas Frank Cr√©bas Despite these differences, the basics of flying the jet will remain broadly similar, but the big change will come with mission employment, Vreeburg said. 'The tactics are different because the capabilities of the F-35 are different. With the F-16, you cannot employ the tactics that the F-35 can. We cannot fly as close to a ground-based threat as the F-35 can. Of course, we have to turn around when confronted by certain aircraft, because they will certainly see us and shoot at us. We might have to outmaneuver their missiles.' While evading modern air defense systems was becoming an increasing challenge for Dutch F-16 pilots, keeping the dwindling number of jets mission-ready proved to be less of a problem. 'There were enough spare parts,' Vreeburg said. 'But I think the biggest contributing factor was that a couple of years ago, we unified our separate maintenance squadrons. So that whole process from a broken jet or a jet needing maintenance to put it back on the flight line was now just one process, instead of broken up into separate ones. And of course, we also have a ton of experience in this squadron. We hand out a gold medal for 36 years of service as a non-commissioned officer. I think have handed out 50 or 60 in the last couple of years. There are lot of people with 30-plus years of F-16 experience.' Specially marked RNLAF F-16AMs top up from a KDC-10 tanker, an aircraft now operated by Omega Air in the United States. Frank Cr√©bas An F-16AM in full afterburner. This jet was among those later transferred to Jordan. Frank Cr√©bas Consistent upgrades, starting with the MLU program, have ensured that the F-16 remains relevant and able to meet the changing demands of air warfare and take on new missions as required. When Vreeburg started flying the Viper in the RNLAF‚Äôs U.S.-based training program, he was using the older Block 15OCU version, but by the time he was back in the Netherlands, he was getting acquainted with the MLU jet, in its initial M1 tape software iteration, followed soon after by the M2 tape. The RNLAF F-16s were successively upgraded to M6.5 tape, adding new capabilities all the time. 'I think one of the biggest changes was the incorporation of Link 16,' Vreeburg explained. 'It‚Äôs made it possible to fly other tactics. After that, each successive generation of targeting pod, which, of course, for our mainly close airport missions in Afghanistan, and later on in Iraq and Syria, was essential to provide support for troops on the ground. Later on, the incorporation of GPS-aided monitions like the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) and Small Diameter Bomb (SDB), then combined laser- and GPS-guided weapons, and the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS), of course.' Yesterday the Dutch JTAC community said their goodbyes to the RNLAF F-16 with one last CAS training mission. The oldest and youngest JTAC controlled 2 312 Vipers over Volkel. Targets destroyed.

Frank Cr√©bas Three Dutch F-16s perform a break for the camera. Frank Cr√©bas Right now, Vreeburg‚Äôs 312 Squadron has already converted its first pilots onto the F-35, and they are now flying with 313 Squadron, which has already converted to the F-35 at Volkel. 'The next pilots transitioning will also fly with 313 Squadron because if you look out of our window, they just started building our Special Access Program Facility [SAPF, used for classified intelligence and secure communications operations related to the F-35]. This whole building needs to be redone. The contractors will come in, strip everything down, redo it, finish it, and then we expect to be able to move back in here in 2027. By that time there should be enough trained pilots and maintainers to start operating with the first one or two flights.' Meanwhile, the first F-35s for 312 Squadron are very nearly ready. Vreeburg confirmed that there are 'a couple of F-35s' for the unit now being completed by Lockheed Martin. 'There were supposed to be done, but they are still waiting to be finished, and that will probably take a little while, but they are already 90 percent done.' Progressive modernization of the Dutch F-16 fleet means that the surviving aircraft are still more than capable in many combat scenarios, and they have been snapped up by Ukraine, which long sought to acquire jets of this type. RNLAF F-16AMs ‚Äî carrying live AIM-120 AMRAAM and AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles ‚Äî escort a U.S. Air Force B-52H over Europe. Frank Cr√©bas 'The Netherlands government has promised 24 F-16s to the Ukrainian government,' Vreeburg explained. 'Our role in this is that we are the last squadron flying the F-16, so the F-16 expertise is in this squadron. We have a separate entity in our squadron, which is going to take care of the required maintenance and the handover to Ukraine. Although 312 Squadron is focused on the transition to the F-35, not everybody can start training at the same time. Maintainers also need to do training for the F-35 and as long as they are waiting to start that, they can help prepare the aircraft for Ukraine. And most of our aircraft are going to industry to get an overhaul, before being transferred to Ukraine. We still need to do some maintenance over here, before flying them to the industry. The only F-16 pilots that we still have are in this squadron or attached to it, so we have a small group of people who will keep flying the F-16 just to get them from Volkel to somewhere else.' Lt. Col. 'Naish' Vreeburg in the cockpit of an F-16AM. Frank Cr√©bas Just 1 more week of RNLAF F-16 operations. Last week another week of fini flights and goodbyes. Even said goodbye to a couple of jets. Preparations for the final goodbye next week Friday are in full swing. Have a nice weekend. Sons of Bonzo! pic.twitter.com/dYcqDAZpND&mdash; Cdt 312 Squadron (@312Cdt) September 20, 2024 While his squadron and the wider RNLAF are very much now focused on the continued introduction of the F-35, Lt. Col. 'Naish' Vreeburg is still convinced that the F-16 has a lot more to offer once it arrives with the Ukrainian Air Force. 'The time has come to let the F-16 go, but I am convinced it can still be very valuable,' Vreeburg concluded. 'Let it go to new owners and a new purpose. Today will be a goodbye, but not the end.

Was A Mini 'Sword Bomb' Just Used To Strike A Car In Lebanon?	Imagery said to show the aftermath of a highly targeted air strike on a car in Lebanon has prompted questions about whether a previously unknown miniature munition designed to produce extremely little collateral damage may have been employed. Damage to the vehicle's windshield, in particular, has drawn broad comparisons to the telltale impact marks of the AGM-114R9X variant of the Hellfire missile, which has an array of pop-out blades rather than an explosive warhead. A video and several still pictures from the strike, which is said to have occurred in the Lebanese capital Beirut, began circulation on social media earlier today. The driver was wounded, but it is unclear what their condition might be now. Whether this individual, who does appear to have been identified as of yet, was the intended target of the strike and whether anyone else was in the car at the time is unknown. This all comes amid a major Israeli campaign targeting the terrorist group Hezbollah characterized so far by unprecedented attacks involving pagers and other electronics rigged to detonate on command, as well as days now of traditional airstrikes. There are now signs Israel may be preparing to invade southern Lebanon. Warning: some of the images below are very graphic.

The damage also looks to be consistent with a non-explosive kinetic munition designed to destroy its target through force of impact. A close-up look at the impact mark on the car's windshield. via X A deeper look at the interior of the car, including the sheered-off steering wheel. via X The cross-shaped impact mark left in the car's windshield is a primary factor that has prompted comparisons to the AGM-114R9X, a weapon The War Zone was first to report on the emergence of back in 2017. Also known by the nicknames 'ninja bomb' and 'the flying Ginsu,' the R9X version of the Hellfire has an array of sword-like blades (likely six) that are designed to pop out right before impact. You can read more about what is known about that missile, which was specifically designed to produce extremely little collateral damage during targeted strikes, here. What's claimed to be the remains of an R9X missile from a recent strike in Syria. This is by far the most complete examples I've seen.cc @FranticGoat Nick Waters (@N_Waters89) June 17, 2020 It is possible that Israel has developed a miniature aerial munition with four pop-out blades in the same general vein as the AGM-114R9X. At the same time, the potential 'blades' are arrayed around a well-defined circular center point. This is very different from what is typically seen after the employment of R9X Hellfires with their long blades explicitly designed to tear through whatever they hit. As such, there is also the possibility the 'blade' marks seen on the windshield of the car in Beirut could also be where the fins of a small munition passed through the windshield. Pictures of a car in Syria believed to have been struck by an AGM-114R9X in 2019 showing the kinds of impact marks associated with that weapon. via X Miniature air-launched munitions of various types, especially to arm equally small drones, are of growing interest globally. There are a number of known designs that feature arrays of stabilizing fins at the tail end or along the body, or both, which could conceivably leave similar impact marks on a car if employed in a non-explosive configuration. Northrop Grumman's Hatchet, the Shyrke from Corvid Technologies and L3Harris, Raytheon's Pyros Small Tactical Munition, and Textron's Fury are examples of such munitions that have been developed just in the United States in recent years. Foreign companies, like Roketsan in Turkey with its MAM family of munitions, are also in this growing market space. Another possibility might be that the munition that hit the car had an explosive warhead, but it did not detonate for some reason. At the same time, Israel does have an established history of employing aerial munitions with reduced explosive payloads or none at all. The U.S. military and others also employ similar kinds of low-collateral damage munitions, including inert bombs with warhead sections filled with concrete. The apparent precision of the strike on the car in Beirut also raises the question of how the munition might have been guided. The War Zone has pointed out in the past that the AGM-114R9X could require an operator-in-the-loop guidance system to be able to hit targets, such as a specific individual inside a moving vehicle, very precisely and to do so reliably. Israeli firms have been and continue to be pioneers in the development of operator-in-the-loop guidance capabilities. Advances in artificial intelligence-driven targeting capabilities could drastically help with this, as well. There is even the possibility that the R9X may have some degree of autonomous guidance that can recognize the selected aim point by itself. Much about the strike on the car in Beirut does remain unknown, but there are certainly signs that point to the employment of a new small and very low collateral damage munition. It would also make great sense to develop and deploy a smaller 'Ginsu-like' munition, especially for use with smaller drones, and for carrying out even more exacting strikes. While what we know about the strike in Beirut does not conclusively prove that such a munition now exists, it may just be a matter of time.

China‚Äôs New Nuclear Submarine Sank During Mysterious Incident In ...	The mysterious incident that TWZ previously reported that occurred at China‚Äôs Wuchang Shipyard in the spring of this year resulted in the sinking of the country‚Äôs latest nuclear-powered attack submarine, according to U.S. officials. The boat in question, originally identified as a conventionally powered submarine, was the first of the new Type 041 Zhou class SSNs. Citing unnamed U.S. officials, a report in The Wall Street Journal today describes an attempt by the Chinese authorities to cover up the accident, involving a submarine 'likely' carrying nuclear fuel when it sank. The boat had been undergoing its final fitting out before going to sea. 'American officials haven‚Äôt detected any indication that Chinese officials have sampled the water or nearby environment for radiation,' the article continues. 'It is possible Chinese personnel were killed or injured when the sub sank, but U.S. officials say they don‚Äôt know if there were casualties.' Well&#8230;there it is. DoD confirms:- a new-construction PRC submarine sank at the pier in Wuhan- the boat was first of a new class, the Type 041 Zhou- PRC authorities scrambled to cover it upAND- DoD reveals that it is nuclear-powered Tom Shugart (@tshugart3) September 26, 2024 There had already been signs that something was amiss at Wuchang Shipyard, part of the state-owned China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC), located on the Yangtze River just outside the city of Wuhan. The unusual activity at the Wuchang Shipyard was first observed by Tom Shugart, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) think tank and a retired U.S. Navy submarine warfare officer. TWZ previously examined satellite imagery showing the sudden appearance of four crane barges at the shipyard in China, these being in place at least from June 12 through June 17. A submarine that had been in the berth in May was absent during those dates, but it was not clear when exactly it was last seen. By the first week of July, the barges were gone and activity at Wuchang appears to have returned to normal.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION The U.S. officials didn‚Äôt provide details of the alleged accident, beyond the fact that it involved one of the new Zhou class SSNs, a design that features a distinctive X-shaped stern. This feature is designed for improved maneuverability, efficiency, and safety, and also helps reduce the acoustic signature across significant parts of the submarine‚Äôs operating envelope, as you can read about here. Using those four cranes, the submarine is said to have been salvaged, but the WSJ report suggests it will 'likely take many months before it can be put to sea' ‚Äî presuming that is even possible. If the submarine fully sank, its internal spaces would likely have filled with water, requiring the replacement of all the electronics. Another view of the Wuchang Shipyard on May 29, showing a submarine moored in the same general location where the crane barges appeared some two weeks later. PHOTOS ¬© 2024 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION 'It‚Äôs not surprising that the PLA Navy would try to conceal the fact that their new first-in-class nuclear-powered attack submarine sank pier-side,' a senior U.S. defense official told the WSJ. 'In addition to the obvious questions about training standards and equipment quality, the incident raises deeper questions about the PLA‚Äôs internal accountability and oversight of China‚Äôs defense industry, which has long been plagued by corruption.' Confirmation from U.S. sources of an accident at one of China‚Äôs most important shipyards, and in particular one that constructs new submarines, is certainly significant. As the above U.S. defense official alludes to, there have been questions raised in the past about safety and quality control practices in Chinese naval shipbuilding, which is often observed progressing very rapidly, even when it comes to large and/or complex vessels. A satellite image taken in September 2022 provides a general view of the Wuchang Shipyard outside of Wuhan, China. Google Earth Despite ‚Äî or because of ‚Äî these shortcomings, China has demonstrated it‚Äôs exponentially more capable of building submarines and other warships than the United States, as you can read more about here. Now the comparative quality of those vessels remains debatable. With that in mind, the sinking of a new SSN is a setback, but not one that is likely to hugely change the pace of the country‚Äôs submarine-building program, which, in contrast to the U.S. equivalent, involved nuclear-powered and conventionally powered designs. The fact that a new SSN is being built at the Wuchang Shipyard is significant in itself. A stock picture of a Type 039A or Yuan class submarine. via U.S. Navy In the past, the Wuchang Shipyard has been predominantly associated with the construction of variants of the Type 039A series boats, also known in the West as the Yuan class. The shipyard also builds various types of surface warships and supports other naval developmental work, including past testing of an electromagnetic railgun. It produces commercial vessels and now it can also add nuclear-powered submarines to the list. It's very unlikely that Chinese authorities will reveal any details of what happened with the submarine during the incident earlier this year. And while it probably will have little impact on the rapidly growing People‚Äôs Liberation Army, its disclosure by U.S. officials does reveal some interesting aspects of the country‚Äôs increasingly diverse submarine-building efforts.

Final KC-10 Extender Tanker Flies Into Retirement	The U.S. Air Force officially said farewell today to the KC-10 Extender, sending its final example to the boneyard, while recognizing the service that the stalwart tanker and cargo aircraft provided since it first entered service in 1981. As you can read about here, the KC-10 inventory has been rapidly reduced over the last couple of years, although it‚Äôs not yet entirely clear what the service‚Äôs future tanker fleet will consist of. Today is a bittersweet day as we bid farewell to the last KC-10A Extender heading to the boneyard. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE, Big Sexy. Share your favorite memories below and tag the friends, colleagues, or family members you've made memories with the #Gucci crew. pic.twitter.com/3mdgHpAkKO&mdash; Travis AFB Official (@Travis60AMW) September 26, 2024 The KC-10 farewell ceremony took place in Hangar 46 at Travis Air Force Base, California, home of the final Air Force wing to operate the type. After official speeches, the last KC-10, callsign GUCCI 10, made the flight from Travis to the boneyard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona. The aircraft made some low passes over Travis before heading to Long Beach, passing over the place it was built.

So long, old friend! Fair skies & tailwinds ‚Äì enjoy your hard earned retirement!I‚Äôll come see you in a museum someday & we‚Äôll reminisce on old times. I‚Äôll bring the patch, too. pic.twitter.com/kmXT5db9LR&mdash; KC-10 Driver B-737 Wrangler (@MCCCANM) September 26, 2024 Unofficially nicknamed 'Gucci' or 'Big Sexy,' the KC-10 was based on the DC-10-30CF and retained 88 percent of systems commonality with the commercial trijet. The Air Force acquired the KC-10 as a ‚Äòheavy tanker‚Äô to supplement the KC-135 Stratotanker family, with a DC-10-derived design chosen since it could be brought into service quickly to provide urgently needed additional tanker capacity. A primary mission was refueling large, fully laden transports flying over long distances, something that would become arguably even more important in the decades to follow. The KC-10 was especially well suited to this mission. With the three main DC-10 wing fuel tanks supplemented by three large fuel tanks under the cargo floor, it accommodated almost twice as much aviation fuel as the KC-135 ‚Äî more than 356,000 pounds. Unlike almost all the KC-135R fleet, the KC-10 was also fitted with its own refueling receptacle, meaning it could take on gas from a KC-135 or another KC-10 to increase its delivery range. Another interesting feature was the KC-10‚Äôs ability to pump fuel in reverse, sending it back up the boom from another aircraft.

Mark C. Olsen Mark Olsen Other advantages over the Stratotanker included the KC-10‚Äôs integrated hose-and-drogue system, allowing it to refuel U.S. Navy and Marine Corps aircraft, as well as probe-equipped receivers flown by other operators, without any further modifications. Twenty KC-10s did, however, receive wing-mounted pods, allowing multiple probe-equipped receivers to top up simultaneously. The KC-10 was also a load-carrying specialist. In its important secondary cargo-carrying mission, the Extender could transport nearly 170,000 pounds of cargo and up to 75 passengers over a distance of around 4,400 miles. The ability to lift cargo and simultaneously refuel other aircraft made the KC-10 ideal for supporting transoceanic deployments of fighters, for example, with support personnel and equipment being carried to the destination while the accompanying jets topped up en route.

G. Woodford (@PWoodford) September 26, 2024 The Air Force bought 60 KC-10As ‚Äî only one variant of the type was ever fielded ‚Äî although one was later lost in an explosion and subsequent fire while undergoing maintenance at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana in 1987. The Netherlands also received two similar KDC-10 aircraft, now operated by Omega Air, a pioneer in the commercial aerial refueling segment. An Omega KDC‚Äê10 tanker refuels a U.S. Air Force F‚Äê16C from the 51st Fighter Wing, en route to Paya Lebar Air Base, Singapore, on November 6, 2023. U.S. Air Force The hard-worked KC-10 fleet was beginning to show its age by 2018 when smoke on the flight deck of one of the aircraft forced the crew to evacuate. A separate fault quickly revealed itself in the same incident, when the crew‚Äôs escape slides failed to activate. The problem was found to affect the entire fleet. At the same time, with DC-10s and MD-11s having left airline service and now also disappearing from cargo operators, the KC-10 was also becoming harder to support. Soon enough, the Air Force was looking for ways to retire the KC-10. Despite some resistance, including from within the military, Congress ultimately approved the divestiture. In July 2020, the retirement of the U.S. Air Force KC-10 fleet began, when the first example arrived at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. As of September 2023, 37 KC-10s were in the boneyard, including 12 that had gone there in that same year. The U.S. Air Force KC-10 completed its final combat deployment on October 5 last year, when the last example departed Prince Sultan Air Base (PSAB) in Saudi Arabia. The KC-10‚Äôs career included more than 30 years spent within the U.S. Air Forces Central (AFCENT) area of responsibility, supporting military operations, including Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom.

Alexander Frank Although the KC-10 has now bowed out, the Air Force is still weighing up options for its future tanker fleet. The immediate replacement for the KC-10 is the KC-46 Pegasus, an aircraft that has had no shortage of problems in its development, many of which persist now that it‚Äôs in service. A KC-46, lower right, conducting refueling receiver tests behind a KC-10 Extender with a KC-135 Stratotanker in the background waiting its turn as refueler. U.S. Air Force U.S. Air Force Photo by Christopher Okula Previously, there were plans to field a KC-10 successor under the KC-Y program, the counterpart to the KC-X, which was to replace the KC-135 (and for which the KC-46 was eventually selected). The question now is what happens after the Air Force receives the last of its 179 KC-46s, which is due to happen in 2029. As soon as the KC-46s are delivered, the service wants to start inducting 75 more aerial refuelers, aircraft that it had previously referred to as 'bridge tankers.' The bridge tankers ‚Äî which could be more KC-46s, Lockheed Martin‚Äôs LMXT, or even based also contractor-based leased solutions ‚Äî are viewed as an interim solution until the Air Force gets the tanker that it really wants, and one that will very likely feature survivability as a core element of its design. This may well result in a design that stresses low-observable features, as we have discussed before. A concept of a future low-observavle tanker from the Lockheed Martin Skunk Works. Lockheed Martin By the time a tanker of that kind is in service, the Cold War-era KC-10 will look even more dated. That said, the aircraft is still providing useful service in its contractor-operated form. It would not be entirely surprising if at least some of the former U.S. Air Force KC-10s end up in the hands of private companies, like the former Dutch KDC-10s with Omega. Were that to happen, the KC-10‚Äôs career refueling U.S. military aircraft might not be over.

Third Marine XQ-58 Valkyrie Flight Test Uses Link 16 For Control	The U.S. Marine Corps says it has demonstrated new capabilities for operating future drones with high degrees of autonomy in expeditionary operations with another test flight of one of its stealthy XQ-58 Valkyries. Newly added capabilities leveraging the popular Link 16 network were central to the test. The Marines have now conducted three XQ-58 flight tests as the service continues to explore how it might use these or other drones in various roles, including as uncrewed electronic warfare aircraft, surveillance and reconnaissance platforms, airborne communications relay, or wingmen for crewed fighters like the F-35. The latest Marine XQ-58 test flight was conducted from the U.S. Air Force's Eglin Air Force Base in Florida on September 20, but was only announced publicly today. The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, the U.S. Navy's Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) of Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), and unnamed industry partners supported the test. Eglin is a major test and training hub and is also home to Air Force XQ-58s. The Air Force, which carried out the Valkyrie's first flight back in 2019, is the only other known operator of the type to date. A US Marine Corps XQ-58 flies together with a pair of US Air Force F-35A Joint Strike Fighters during a previous test out of Eglin Air Force Base in 2023. USAF Kratos included a version of this picture, taken during a test flight out of Eglin Air Force Base on February 23, 2024, in its press release yesterday that mentioned the MQ-58B. USAF The new Marine XQ-58 test 'demonstrated newly added Link-16 capabilities for the uncrewed collaborative combat aircraft prototype, marking the first time the Department of Defense controlled an air vehicle using offboard expeditionary methods,' according to an official release. No further details were provided about the 'offboard expeditionary methods' employed during the flight. 'Initial results indicate that the prototype met threshold requirements for autonomously exchanging relevant tactical information,' the Marine release adds. 'These Link-16 capabilities significantly enhance the Marine Air-Ground Task Force‚Äôs ability to conduct integrated and joint operations, contributing to the Marine Corps' mission to deter conflict and, when necessary, defeat enemies in complex and evolving scenarios.' Another look at a Marine XQ-58 during a previous flight test. USAF An XQ-58A seen during the type's first flight in Marine Corps service in October 2023. USAF Link 16 is one of the most common communications waveforms utilized in the U.S. military today. The network has been used in various past drone testing, including ones involving the control of uncrewed aircraft from remote locations. Work is underway now to extend the Link 16 network into space, which will offer significant advantages in breadth and persistence of coverage, as you can read more about here. As such, using Link 16 to demonstrate new ways to control and otherwise exchange information with drones like the XQ-58 makes good sense. The Marine Corps' use of Link 16 via 'offboard expeditionary' capabilities also aligns fully with the service's desire to be able to use future uncrewed aircraft like this to support forces at and even potentially operate from far-flung forward locations with limited infrastructure. The Marines are now further looking to demonstrate how uncrewed aircraft might fit into those future operations next month. 'This successful test [on September 20] was conducted in preparation for Emerald Flag 2024, a multiservice and multi-domain training exercise scheduled for October,' according to the Marines. 'The exercise will incorporate technology and focus on the efficiency of joint warfare. The XQ-58A has proven itself ready for this capstone event, allowing the Marine Corps to demonstrate cooperative kill chain closure between manned and unmanned strike platforms for the first time in a large-force exercise.' The War Zone has highlighted in the past how the baseline version of the XQ-58, specifically, which takes off and lands without any need for a runway at all, would be ideally suited to the Corps' vision for future expeditionary and distributed operations. Kratos, maker of the Valkyrie, has also demonstrated a specialized launch trolley that allows the drones to take off from traditional runways, and do so with more fuel and/or larger payloads. The company is now in the process of crafting a version with built-in landing gear. The addition of a Link 16 capability on the Marine XQ-58 also highlights the drone's ability to serve as a valuable communications relay node. Previous Air Force testing has already involved Valkyries carrying software-defined communications packages capable of 'talking' to stealthy datalinks like the Intra-Flight Data Link (IFDL) on the F-22 Raptor and the Multifunctional Advanced Data Link (MADL) found on all three variants of the F-35. MADL could also be a feature on the forthcoming B-21 Raider stealth bomber. F-35s also have Link16 capability, but transmitting via the omnidirectional datalinks used with that waveform makes it easier for hostile forces to detect and track the otherwise stealthy jets. Those datalinks are also more susceptible to jamming than low probability of intercept/low probability of detection (LPI/LPD) types like MADL and IFDL. It's also worth noting that MADL and IFDL cannot communicate directly with each other. This only further underscores the importance of gateway nodes that can translate between various waveforms in future operations, which could also involve allies and partners using their own networks.

USAF A US Air Force XQ-58A, at bottom left, flies together with an F-35A, in the middle, and an F-22 Raptor stealth fighter at top right, during a test. USAF The Marine Corps' XQ-58 flight test last week also speaks to broader questions that the entire U.S. military is working to answer about how to control and otherwise manage an increasingly large number of uncrewed platforms, as well as how much autonomy they can and should have going forward. The Marines are currently part of a tri-service agreement with the U.S. Navy and the Air Force regarding the development of future Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones, which focuses heavily on common control and communications architectures. While the exact roles and missions CCAs will be able to perform, and how they will be deployed and employed operationally, have already been evolving, there is a broad consensus that they will operate very closely together with crewed aircraft, at least initially. 'As we go forward, I expect there‚Äôll be a strike aspect to CCAs, as well, but initially we‚Äôre focused on air superiority and how to use the CCAs in conjunction with a crewed aircraft to achieve air superiority,' Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall told The War Zone and other outlets at a media roundtable on the sidelines of the Air & Space Forces Association's (AFA) main annual conference last week. 'When we do the ops analysis, there‚Äôs a really clear advantage of that.' 'One of the things you have to have if you‚Äôre going to use CCAs and have them be armed and ‚Ä¶ Lethal is that they have to be under tight control. And, for me, one of the elements of that needs to be line-of-sight communications. And I think that that‚Äôs an important thing to have in the mix, secure, reliable line-of-sight communications. We‚Äôre not going to have aircraft going out and doing engagements uncontrolled,' Kendall added. 'So the default, if they lose communications, would be for them to return to base, which takes them out of the fight. So we don‚Äôt want that to happen. And when they do do engagements, ‚Ä¶ we want them under tight control. So I think the mix of crewed and uncrewed aircraft, I think, is going to be the right answer for the foreseeable future.' 'We know two things about autonomy,' Andrew Hunter, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology & Logistics, said at a separate roundtable at the recent AFA conference. 'One is laws of war require us to have, you know, human engagement in key decisions involving employment of weapons and other key decisions. So we have to have that. We have to have that human engagement, the ability to do that. The second is [that] we know that our ability to create systems that can operate autonomously and do missions well is something that is still maturing.' 'So, in other words, there are things that we know that we already know how to do well with autonomy, and there‚Äôs things that we know we do not know how to do well with autonomy,' Hunter continued. 'So we‚Äôre going to stick to the things we know we can do well, and then have humans do the other things, and, over time, that mix is going to change‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not going to be static.' With all this in mind, the Marine Corps' latest XQ-58 flight test looks to be a significant step forward for that service's future uncrewed aviation plans, as well as one that could be important in informing CCA and other future drone developments across the U.S. military.

Biden Surging $8B In Aid To Ukraine That Includes AGM-154 Joint S...	Hours before he was scheduled to meet with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky, U.S. President Joe Biden announced nearly $8 billion in additional military aid for Kyiv. The move will provide Ukraine with long-range strike weapons, air defenses, and additional F-16 training for pilots, among other items. 'For nearly three years, the United States has rallied the world to stand with the people of Ukraine as they defend their freedom from Russian aggression, and it has been a top priority of my administration to provide Ukraine with the support it needs to prevail,' Biden said in a statement early Thursday morning. 'In that time, Ukraine has won the battle of Kyiv, reclaimed more than half the territory that Russia seized at the start of the war, and safeguarded its sovereignty and independence. But there is more work to do. That is why, today, I am announcing a surge in security assistance for Ukraine and a series of additional actions to help Ukraine win this war.' The new aid comes from two pools of funding. Most of it - $5.5 billion - is from Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) funding. That program sends military equipment to Ukraine from existing U.S. stocks and pays for its replenishment. By issuing his directive to the Pentagon, Biden assures that the Congressionally authorized PDA funds to not expire on Sept. 30 with the end of the current fiscal year. The second pool of funds - $2.4 billion - is from the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) and provides money to Ukraine to procure listed items directly from manufacturers. The USAI funds 'will provide Ukraine with additional air defense, Unmanned Aerial Systems, and air-to-ground munitions, as well as strengthen Ukraine‚Äôs defense industrial base and support its maintenance and sustainment requirements,' Biden stated. 'To enhance Ukraine‚Äôs long-range strike capabilities, I have decided to provide Ukraine with' AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) glide munitions,' Biden announced. The unpowered air-to-ground weapon will be used by Ukraine‚Äôs donated F-16s. They have a range of over 70 miles, depending on flight profile, so it can be launched from outside the range of many enemy‚Äôs air defense systems. You can read what this weapon will bring in terms of capabilities to Ukraine in our previous report here. U.S. President Joe Biden has decided to provide Ukraine with AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapons (JSOW) (Ioannis Lekkas ) Back in a June of 2023, we published a large feature about the potential weapons that would equip Ukraine's F-16s. In that piece we posited JSOW would be the most likely standoff strike option to be transferred for a number of reasons. Biden also directed the Pentagon to 'refurbish and provide Ukraine with an additional Patriot air defense battery and to provide Ukraine with additional Patriot missiles.' The U.S. has so far provided Ukraine with two such systems. President Joe Biden has ordered the Pentagon to provide Ukraine with an additional Patriot air defense system battery. (DoD) In addition, Biden ordered the Pentagon to 'expand training for Ukrainian F-16 pilots, including by supporting the training of an additional 18 pilots next year.' Ukraine had only around half a dozen pilots trained to fly the F-16 when the first jets were delivered this summer, and one has been killed. The lack of pilots and robust training to support a fleet that could end up being nearly 100 jets has been a major concern of Kyiv's. Beyond military aid, Biden announced that the Department of Justice, the Department of the Treasury, and the U.S. Secret Service 'have taken action today to disrupt a global cryptocurrency network, in coordination with international partners.' That move is designed to 'counter Russian sanctions evasion and money laundering, The United States will continue to raise the costs on Russia for its war in Ukraine and to deprive the Russian defense industrial base of resources.' Biden did not specify what systems will be provided to Ukraine under the additional PDA funding. However, on Wednesday, the Pentagon announced a new $375 million package - the 66th PDA - that included the first donation of JSOWs. That PDA package also included: Ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS); 155mm and 105mm artillery ammunition; Tube-launched, Optically tracked, Wire-guided (TOW) missiles; Javelin and AT-4 anti-armor systems; M1117 Armored Security Vehicles; Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Vehicles; Light tactical vehicles; Armored bridging systems; Small arms; Patrol boats; Demolitions equipment and munitions; Spare parts, ancillary equipment, services, training, and transportation.

(Photo by Aimee Dilger/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) The new aid funding announcement comes as Zelensky visited the U.S. to drum up support for his as-yet-undisclosed 'victory plan.' It is said to include long-term guarantees for security assistance as well as requests for more long-range weapons and the ability to use them deep inside Russia, something Biden so far has refused to do, fearing a backlash from Russian President Vladimir Putin and concerns about maintaining U.S. supplies. While Zelensky has yet to publicly disclose his victory plan, it is being met with skepticism by the Biden administration, The Wall Street Journal reported. The plan 'lacks a comprehensive strategy and is little more than a repackaged request for more weapons and the lifting of restrictions on long-range missiles,' the publication reported, citing U.S. officials. The Biden administration is concerned that the Ukrainian leader‚Äôs plan for winning the war against Russia lacks a comprehensive strategy, U.S. officials said The Wall Street Journal (@WSJ) September 25, 2024 During his trip to Washington, Zelensky will also meet with Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, to discuss his plan. A meeting with Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump seems to be off the table at the moment. Trump and fellow Republicans have taken to chastizing Zelensky, with many calling for him to fire Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova over his visit last week to an ammunition plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania because no Republicans were involved.

Before he arrived, most of the money for the new aid was still caught up in the uncertainties of the U.S. political process. Biden was forced to announce the new package after Congress failed to include a request from the administration to extend the Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) for Ukraine in the stopgap funding bill that passed on Wednesday night, The Hill reported. 'The failure of Congress to extend the PDA is one symptom of Washington‚Äôs dysfunction and increased Republican opposition over allocating aid for Ukraine,' the publication explained. Even with the new aid, Ukraine faces an increasingly difficult fight from Russia, especially in the east, where several towns are in danger of falling. It continues to advance incrementally in Russia's Kursk region, but how much longer Zelensky can staff and equip both fronts remains to be seen. Ukraine should get new equipment and weapons from existing U.S. stocks soon but it will be years before they can procure weapons from manufacturers. The dynamics on the battlefield could be radically different the next time Zelensky visits the U.S. Contact the author: howard@thewarzone.com	https://www.twz.com/news-features/biden-surging-8b-in-aid-to-ukraine-that-includes-agm-154-joint-standoff-weapons-for-f-16s	2024-09-26T10:02:12-07:00	https://www.twz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/JSOW-F16.jpg?quality=85
Israel‚Äôs Potential Invasion Of Southern Lebanon Looms Larger	In the wake of Hezbollah‚Äôs first ballistic missile attack on Israel, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have been told to prepare to fight in Lebanon. That statement, from the Chief of Staff of the Israeli Defense Forces, is the strongest indication so far that an invasion of the north is fast approaching. 'You hear the jets overhead; we have been striking all day. This is both to prepare the ground for your possible entry and to continue degrading Hezbollah,' Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said in a message to his troops on Wednesday. 'Today, Hezbollah expanded its range of fire, and later today, they will receive a very strong response. Prepare yourselves.' The Chief of the General Staff Herzi Halevi:'Today, Hezbollah expanded its range of fire, and later today, they will receive a very strong response. Prepare yourselves. Today, we will continue, we are not stopping; we keep striking and hitting them everywhere. The goal is very‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/oQi00DOhZS&mdash; Joe Truzman (@JoeTruzman) September 25, 2024 Halevi told the troops they would be needed to create a buffer zone to help foster the return of tens of thousands of Israelis who have fled their homes in northern Israel as a result of Hezbollah missile, rocket and drone attacks. 'To achieve that, we are preparing the process of a maneuver, which means your military boots, your maneuvering boots, will enter enemy territory, enter villages that Hezbollah has prepared as large military outposts, with underground infrastructure, staging points, and launchpads into our territory and carry out attacks on Israeli civilians.' THIS is how close Hezbollah‚Äôs weapons are located to communities in Israel.Each picture shows different civilian houses in southern Lebanon that had weapons ready to be used to kill Israelis.We are operating in this area in order to eliminate the presence of terrorist‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/M0ACnPMYLW&mdash; Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) September 25, 2024 Israeli troops, he vowed, are more than up to the challenge. The IDF has called up two reserve brigades to bolster its forces in the north, according to PBS. 'Your entry into those areas with force, your encounter with Hezbollah operatives, will show them what it means to face a professional, highly skilled, and battle-experienced force,' he added. 'You are coming in much stronger and far more experienced than they are. You will go in, destroy the enemy there, and decisively destroy their infrastructure. These are the things that will allow us to safely return the residents of the north afterward.' A ground operation into southern Lebanon appears aimed at creating a buffer zone to keep Hezbollah from using its massive quantities of short-range rockets, as well as anti-tank missiles, small drones, and sniper fire to make life near the border and in northern Israel in general very challenging. While the goal may be to protect the north, Hezbollah also has an arsenal of missiles and drones that can strike into Israel from a significant distance. So such an operation could severely degrade Hezbollah's ability to strike into Israel, but it alone would not come close to eliminating it entirely. Hezbollah's long-range capabilities were driven home when the militant group fired what it called a Qader-1 ballistic missile at Mossad headquarters near Tel Aviv yesterday. Hezbollah 'confirmed that the targeted headquarters is responsible for assassinating the leaders and blowing up the pagers and wireless devices,' the group‚Äôs Al Mayadeen news outlet reported on Telegram. You can read our reporting of the first wave of those explosions here, and the second wave here. Israeli officials say the missile was intercepted by the David‚Äôs Sling air defense system with no casualties or damage. The IDF said it quickly struck the launch site.

Little is known about the Qader-1. The official Iranian Mehr news agency described it as 'a long-range missile' using a combination of solid and liquid fuel, with a range of up to 1,950 km (about 1,200 miles) and a warhead weighing between 700 and 1,000 kilograms (about 1,540 to 2,200 pounds.' As we noted in our deep dive into Hezbollah's massive arsenal of missiles and rockets, the Lebanese militant group's weapons development and stockpile is primarily provided by Iran. One expert on Iranian and Hezbollah weapons told The War Zone that it could be from the Fateh family of weapons. The Qader-1 could be 'a single-stage, short-range ballistic missile, probably a copy of the Fateh system,' Benham Ben Taleblu, a senior research fellow with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank in Washington D.C., told The War Zone Wednesday. It could be a Fateh-110, he surmised. Or it could be 'the domestic upgrade that turns rockets into missiles with guidance systems and controllable fins.' After we interviewed Taleblu, Hezbollah released images it claims were the Qader-1. After The War Zone shared them with Taleblu, he said that confirmed his earlier suspicions about it being some version of a Fateh-110. Hezbollah shows its Qader-1 ballistic missile fired on Tel Aviv.Range: 190 km.Diameter: 620 mmLength: 7,665 mmTotal weight: 2,870 kgTotal weight of the warhead: 500 kgSimply, downgraded variant of Iran's Fateh-110 ballistic missile. pic.twitter.com/T2NU1rhXIW&mdash; Clash Report (@clashreport) September 25, 2024 As we previously reported, the Fateh-110 is one of the longest-range weapons Hezbollah possesses, able to reach targets as far away as 186 miles. That is certainly far enough to strike Tel Aviv, about 70 miles south of the border. The Fateh-110 can carry a high explosive warhead weighing around 1,000 pounds and has become increasingly accurate in later variants and derivatives, with GPS-assisted guidance added. The use of Fateh-110s and Zolfaghar (also written Zulfiqar) derivatives to target a U.S. military base at Erbil, in Iraq, in March 2022, as well as on other targets in Syria, suggests that current variants are much more accurate, offering true precision strike capabilities. It remains unclear if Hezbollah has the latest versions and/or in what quantities.

'This is the first launch by Hezbollah of a ballistic missile at Israel,' he stated. That Hezbollah launched just one ballistic missile may be a message to Israel that the campaign described by Halevi to degrade Hezbollah ahead of a looming Israeli incursion did not work, an Al Jazeera correspondent posited. 'It‚Äôs only one missile, so it‚Äôs more than likely to be a message from Hezbollah that they still have ballistic missile capability,' Al Jazeera‚Äôs Imran Khan said.

The Biden administration 'is working on a new diplomatic initiative for a ‚Äòpause‚Äô in the fighting in Lebanon and a resumption of negotiations on a Gaza hostage and ceasefire deal,' Axios reported, citing two U.S. officials, one Israeli official and two sources with direct knowledge. 'The aim is to achieve a pause that will give space for negotiations on a broader diplomatic deal to prevent a wider war, allow displaced civilians to return to their homes on both sides of the border, and provide renewed momentum for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal.' While Axios suggested that the plan could be announced as early as Wednesday, it had yet to officially emerge as of 6:30 PM Eastern time. U.S. preparing plan for temporary Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire. The plan could be announced as early as today. My story on @axios Barak Ravid (@BarakRavid) September 25, 2024 Asked whether his country would join Hezbollah in a fight against Isreal, Iran's Vice President Javad Zarif told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that both Iran and Hezbollah 'have exercised restraint' so far. 'Iran has exercised restraint when Israel took conducted military operations against Iran, conducted terrorist operations killing the leader of Hamas who was attending the inauguration of our president, of all things, and we exercised restraint,' Zarif said. 'We believe that Hezbollah is capable of defending itself. It has been exercising restraint enough to doing so, it is the responsibility of the international community to come in before Hezbollah has to take its defense into its own hands and maybe, the situation will get out hand.'

Given the dynamics in the region and Israel's growing frustration with Hezbollah attacks, which have now reached their furthest point yet, whether the Biden adminisgtration can prevent a ground war in Lebanon could be a challenge.

First Chinese ICBM Test Into The Pacific In Decades Is A Big Deal	For the first time in more than four decades, China has fired an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) out in the Western Pacific, ostensibly for training purposes. As an individual act, this sends immediate signals, especially to the United States and its allies. There are also signs that the launch could be the start of more regular open-ocean tests as China continues to dramatically expand its nuclear stockpile and ICBM arsenal. Transporter-erector-launchers for China's DF-41, one of a number of ICBM types the country currently has in service, on parade. GREG BAKER/AFP via Getty Images The Chinese Ministry of National Defense announced the ICBM launch earlier today (it is now Thursday, September 26, in China), but provided only limited details and did not identify the specific type of missile that was fired. The Ministry did stress that the missile was not loaded with live warheads. The last time China sent an ICBM of any kind flying out into the Pacific, at least that we know of, was in 1980. Chinese ICBM launches since then have been targeted at inland ranges in the Western end of the country. Chinese forces have fired shorter-range ballistic missiles into bodies of water within the broader Western Pacific region, including the South China Sea, in the intervening years. Publicly available warning notices show that the missile was launched from China's Hainan Island at the northern end of the South China Sea and indicate it was aimed at a patch of the Pacific just outside of France's Exclusive Economic Zone around French Polynesia. The distance between the launch and impact points is roughly 7,145 miles (11,500 kilometers). 1/x#China announced that they test-fired an #ICBM into the central #Pacific this morning (25 Sep) at 00:44 UTC.From Navigational Warnings and NOTAM's, it was fired from Hainan with a ~11 700 km range and RV impact near 10.4 S, 146.5 W.@nukestrat @planet4589 @wslafoy @nktpnd pic.twitter.com/WnhcxNiLxQ&mdash; Dr Marco Langbroek (@Marco_Langbroek) September 25, 2024 4/xApproximate 3D flightpath (exact launch site on Hainan is unknown for now) pic.twitter.com/dmTkrJSmgQ&mdash; Dr Marco Langbroek (@Marco_Langbroek) September 25, 2024 It is unclear if @francediplo and @presidencepf were contacted in advance (beyond the NOTAM). The landing zone of the Chinese's reentry vehicle is right next to the French Polynesian EEZ. This is clearly problematic and possibly part of China's signaling. pic.twitter.com/1jC7VVqj0I&mdash; S√©bastien Philippe (@seb6philippe) September 25, 2024 Launching from Hainan points to the missile that was fired being a road-mobile ICBM, such as a DF-31 or DF-41, rather than a silo-based one. China has been massively expanding its silo infrastructure in recent years, but all of the known fields are deep within the mainland. It is also worth noting that China also has silo-based versions of the DF-31 and that there have long been discussions about the likely possibility of a variant of the DF-41 variant that can be launched in this way, as well. China's last known open-ocean ICBM launch was of an older silo-based DF-5. The ICBM test shows a range of 11,500 km. Applying the same range from the new missile silo field in Ordos, China, we can see that the entire United States in within the range of this ICBM should it be deployed in the new silos. pic.twitter.com/Kksu5WqTEd&mdash; S√©bastien Philippe (@seb6philippe) September 25, 2024 Satellite imagery the Pentagon has previously released of work on a new silo in a field in northwestern China. DOD Satellite imagery included in the Pentagon's last annual China report showing what appears to be the completion of work, at least externally, on a new ICBM silo in a field in northwestern China. DOD Experts and observers have pointed out that there is real practical training and testing value to China's new Pacific ICBM launch. This includes just being able to go through the full motions of firing such a missile out to its intended range along a typical flight profile. When launched at targets on inland ranges, Chinese ICBMs are fired at very high trajectories to account for the relatively limited space available. A live-fire launch from Hainan would also offer Chinese personnel a valuable opportunity to practice deploying a road-mobile launcher to a forward site and actually employing it once there. Other nuclear powers, including the United States, routinely launch nuclear-capable ballistic missiles out into the Pacific, as well as the Atlantic, for training and testing purposes, as well as to demonstrate general deterrent capacity and otherwise send signals. That means, if the PLARF wanted to test a depressed trajectory, they're going to need to find another place to test their ICBMs - like the pacific ocean.&mdash; Decker Eveleth (@dex_eve) September 25, 2024 Especially considering the ICBM they launched is almost certainly launched from a mobile launcher. By doing it out at Hainan and launching from a potentially unfamiliar launch location the missile crew may be unfamiliar with you can identify potential pitfalls in the process.&mdash; Decker Eveleth (@dex_eve) September 25, 2024 At the same time, the first Chinese open-ocean ICBM launch into the Pacific in decades sends clear signals to countries across the region and beyond. Chinese authorities expressly notified their counterparts in the United States, Australia and New Zealand, all three of which are allies, about the impending launch, according to Japan's Kyodo News. Unsurprisingly, a U.S. Air Force RC-135S Cobra Ball, an aircraft specifically configured to gather intellignce about missile launches, looks to have been in the air in the Western Pacific at the time based on online flight tracking data. The over-water launch would have given the U.S. government and others a rare opportunity to glean new insights into current Chinese ICBM capabilities. China conducted a rare test launch of 'an ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) carrying a dummy warhead' into the Pacific. To track it, the US deployed an RC-135 Cobra Ball aircraft to collect optical and electronic data of the missile and warhead. pic.twitter.com/OCClNYSV2j&mdash; Hans Kristensen (@nukestrat) September 25, 2024 Whether any other countries were notified in advance is unclear. As already noted, the impact point appears to have been close to the territory of another American ally, France, which has also been looking to expand its military presence in the Pacific. The missile's path looks to have snaked between Taiwan and the Philippines ‚Äì also both major American partners in the region ‚Äì based on the warning notices, as well. China has confirmed the successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into the Pacific Ocean, available public data mapped shows danger zones almost as close as 90-km to the Philippines were announced by China as a part of this test pic.twitter.com/ZqovtlQhEu&mdash; Damien Symon (@detresfa_) September 25, 2024 The ICBM launch came just hours after U.S. President Joe Biden called attention to competition and cooperation with China, as well as America's strong ties with South Korea and Japan, in an address to the United Nations. 'We also need to uphold our principles as we seek to responsibly manage the competition with China so it does not veer into conflict,' Biden said. 'We stand ready to cooperate on urgent challenges for the good of our people and the people everywhere.' The launch also follows years now of the U.S. government drawing attention to the Chinese military's significantly expanding nuclear and missile arsenals, including the aforementioned silo build-up, and calling for greater transparency about these developments. China's nuclear stockpile more than doubled in size just between 2020 and 2023, according to the Pentagon. These Chinese have an estimated 500 warheads, in total, now, and that figure is expected to grow to around 1,000 by 2030 and 1,500 by 2035, according to U.S. government asessments. In August, The New York Times reported that U.S. nuclear deterrent strategy had become primarily focused around China for the first time ever. The Times' story cited a classified document that the outlet said further warned about 'possible coordinated nuclear challenges from China, Russia and North Korea.' China's ties with Russia, including in the realm of military cooperation, have grown substantially in recent years, especially since 2022 with the Kremlin's increasing global isolation as a result of the ongoing war in Ukraine. Russia and Chinese warships in the Tsugaru Strait between the Japanese home islands of Honshu and Hokkaido during a naval exercise in 2021. Photo by Sun Zifa/China News Service via Getty Images American officials have also been pushing to get their Chinese counterparts to the table to negotiate possible new strategic arms control agreements, so far without any real success. Geopolitical friction exists between China and the United States, as well as many other countries in the Pacific region and beyond, over a host of issues, including the status of the island of Taiwan. Beijing's expansive and largely unrecognized territorial claims, especially in the South China Sea, also present particularly significant risks for flashpoint moments that could easily turn into larger conflicts, as has been seen in recent months around the Philippines. The new Chinese open-ocean ICBM launch could also be intended to send signals domestically. The People's Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) was reportedly at the center of a number of corruption scandals that prompted major leadership shakeups in 2023, as you can read more about here. The PLARF oversees the country‚Äôs arsenal of nuclear and conventionally-armed ground-based ballistic, cruise, and hypersonic missiles, as well as various supporting elements. Beyond any immediate messaging, these are signs that the ICBM launch from Hainan reflects bigger changes in Chinese policy coming down the line. The Chinese Ministry of Defense described firing the missile out into the Pacific as a 'routine' part of an 'annual training plan,' which suggests this could be just the start of launches like this occurring more regularly. Especially as its nuclear arsenal grows in scale and scope, and its deterrence policies evolve along with that, China will need to increasingly demonstrate the full range of its capabilities and do so in more open and credible manners. As already noted, the United States and other nuclear powers routinely conduct open-ocean launches of nuclear-capable ballistic missiles for exactly these reasons. China's first open-ocean ICBM test since 1980 is still a major development by itself that highlights the country's still expanding nuclear and missile capabilities.

Search For Cargo Drone That Can Lift Twice As Much As A CH-53K Ki...	The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is looking to explore concepts for a new drone capable of lugging around up to 70,000 pounds (or 35 tons) of cargo, roughly twice what the U.S. Marine Corps' CH-53K King Stallion helicopter can lift. Unlike the CH-53K, the new uncrewed aircraft would be a shorter-range platform focused primarily on moving outsized payloads between ships and beachheads ashore, as well as across wide rivers and other similar 'gaps' inland. DARPA's Tactical Technology Office (TTO) recently put out a call for information about 'innovative and revolutionary concepts for heavy lift Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) that are capable of lifting a 70,000lb payload utilizing current Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) engines and drive train technology' as part of what it has dubbed the Cost Efficient Cargo project. The contracting notice explicitly notes that 'the Sikorsky CH-53K King Stallion is currently the American [military] helicopter with the highest payload capacity at 36,000lbs.' It is worth pointing out here that Sikorsky Skycrane helicopters, which have even greater lift capacity, remain in use in the commercial sector in the United States. The notice further outlines a notional mission profile for a future Cost Efficient Cargo drone wherein it would 'fly from a prepared base to the payload location [and] attach/obtain 70,000lb payload, traverse 25mi at 500ft, detach payload, [and then] return to base 25mi [away].' A CH-53K prepares to lift a non-flying F-35C test airframe. USN Beyond a desire for the drone to use a high degree of COTS components, the stated design requirements are very open-ended. DARPA's contracting notice indicates a willingness to consider uncrewed aircraft powered by traditional fuel-burning engines or electronic motors, or a hybrid combination of both. The projected mission profile and the comparison to the CH-53K, as a mention of 'rotors' also point to an interest in vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capable platforms. However, DARPA does not explicitly say this is a hard requirement. 'Autonomous functions are expected but not the focus of this RFI [request for information],' the contracting notice says. 'Additionally, DARPA is interested in identification of design insights and key risks that can be addressed within a scaled down form to further substantiate DoD investment in heavy lift systems and challenge the paradigm of current UAS design as a whole,' the Cost Efficient Cargo notice adds. A range of potential scaled payload capacities (10,000, 30,000, and 45,000 pounds) and ranges (10, 25, 50, and 100 miles) that are of interest are provided. 'The bottom line is that the U.S. needs to move large and heavy cargo cheaply. Examples are moving a 40ft ISO container off a container ship 10 miles out at sea onto land, or a Bradley fighting vehicle from one side of a canyon to the other,' according to DARPA. 'There are significant challenges in amphibious operations and land maneuvers, where armed forces must move troops, vehicles, and supplies from naval vessels to a beachhead and then across natural or man-made obstacles.' 'These operations are complicated by the need for landing craft and amphibious vehicles to navigate shallow waters, avoid obstacles, and contend with enemy defenses. The speed of movement is a critical operational need; any delays in offloading personnel and equipment during both the ship to shore phase and on shore wide gap crossings can expose forces to enemy fire and hinder the establishment of a secure foothold,' the contracting notice adds. 'Additionally, weather and sea conditions can severely impact the safety and efficiency of landings, while enemy defenses, including mines, artillery, and entrenched infantry, pose significant risks.' 'Once a foothold is secured, forces often encounter wide gaps, such as rivers, ravines, or destroyed bridges, that hinder the movement of heavy equipment,' it continues. 'These obstacles require engineering solutions such as pontoon bridges or amphibious vehicles, but such operations are time-consuming, giving the enemy time to prepare.' Concerns about ever-growing challenges in getting cargo from ships to shore, especially in higher-end conflict scenarios against opponents like China with substantial anti-access and area denial capabilities, are hardly new. Ever-more-capable anti-ship cruise missiles have been cited particularly often as a significant threat to amphibious warfare ships that will only increasingly limit how close they can get to shore. Launching forces, either in landing craft or amphibious vehicles, from further out to sea puts them at greater risk, as well.

CSBA Even once a beachhead is established, friendly forces would still have to contend with a variety of threats. The U.S. military's recent experience operating a temporary pier to try to help get additional humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip underscores how weather and other environmental factors can present additional serious issues for amphibious operations.

Satellite image ¬©2024 Maxar Technologies As DARPA's Cost Efficient Cargo contracting notice highlights, gap-crossing operations inland across rivers and other obstacles, natural and man-made, face many of the same kinds of challenges. The ongoing war in Ukraine has underscored these realities, especially when it comes to the employment of temporary combat-bridging capabilities. The steady proliferation of longer-range precision-guided munitions and near-real-time intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities only increases the vulnerability of static crossing points.

A bunch of ammo got destroyed, the Russians ammo starved pic.twitter.com/aRxH5mToyS&mdash; PS01 ‚ñ≥ (@PStyle0ne1) August 20, 2024 At the same time, there are questions about how effective and efficient a fleet of future heavy-lift drones, especially ones with limited range, might be in addressing the aforementioned issues. While a payload capacity of up to 70,000 pounds is substantial, so are the weights of the kinds of cargoes that DARPA envisions the Cost Efficient Cargo platform moving. For instance, the recent contracting notice specifically mentions the Bradley Fighting Vehicle. The typical weight of the latest M2A4 version of the Bradley with a full combat load is 80,000 pounds, according to manufacturer BAE Systems. The M2A4E1 Bradley seen here has an Iron Fist active protection system that makes it even heavier than the standard A4 variant. US Army A need for more drones flying more sorties to meet the desired mission demand could negatively impact the cost-effectiveness equation even if the underlying Cost Efficient Cargo system is relatively cheap to acquire and operate. It is worth noting that the same kinds of cost calculations already apply to crewed platforms. With a current unit price of around $118 million, the CH-53K is a notably expensive aircraft. The U.S. military does increasingly see drones carrying cargo and potentially personnel as key to meeting logistical requirements, especially in major conflicts, such as one against China in the Pacific. The U.S. Marine Corps, which has been completely restructuring itself around new expeditionary and distributed concepts operations in recent years, is pushing to acquire three different tiers of VTOL cargo drones. The Kaman KARGO drone depicted in the video below is one of the designs the Marine Corps is currently considering acquiring. The U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force, which expect to see their forces widely dispersed in future high-end fights, are also exploring VTOL (like the Piasecki ARES seen in the video below) and fixed-wing uncrewed aircraft to support logistics missions. However, none of the platforms U.S. military services are pursuing now have anywhere near the payload-carrying capacity DARPA is looking at for Cost Efficient Cargo. As The War Zone has highlighted in the past, the U.S. military is also increasingly lagging behind China in its development of uncrewed aerial logistics capabilities, especially when it comes to fixed-wing cargo-carrying drones. Two new Chinese cargo-carrying drones, one from ostensibly private firm Tengden and another from the state-run Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), separately made their first flights just earlier this year. How any heavy lift drones that come out of the Cost Efficient Cargo project might fit into the U.S. military's future air mobility ecosystem remains to be seen, but DARPA's new project reflects real operational demands and growing challenges in meeting them.

New Dutch Navy Support Vessels Will Be Missile-Toting Wingmen To ...	The Netherlands has unveiled plans for two new support vessels of a novel design that stresses modularity, including containerized weapons and sensors for a variety of different missions, and a relatively tiny crew. Reflecting current operational realities, each of the new ships will pack additional air defense missiles to help existing Dutch frigates put up more effective and persistent firepower in the face of the kinds of massed missile and drone attacks that have proliferated in the Middle East. In an announcement yesterday, the Dutch Ministry of Defense said that it would spend between ‚Ç¨250 million and ‚Ç¨1 billion ($279 million to $1.1 billion) on the two new support vessels. Varende gereedschapskisten. Zo kun je de 2 nieuwe multifunctionele ondersteuningsvaartuigen voor de @kon_marine ook wel noemen.

Wat voegen ze toe aan onze vloot? pic.twitter.com/0uB7rOjTGI&mdash; Gijs Tuinman (@DefensieStas) September 24, 2024 A Dutch Ministry of Defense told Defense News that the new ships will be around 174 feet long, with a beam of 32 feet, and will displace around 600 tons. This makes them significantly smaller than the De Zeven Provinci√´n class frigates, four of which spearhead the Royal Netherlands Navy. Each of these frigates is roughly 473 feet long, with a beam of 61 feet, and displaces around 6,600 tons, fully loaded. The Royal Netherlands Navy De Zeven Provinci√´n class frigate HNLMS Tromp (F803) in the Pacific Ocean for the RIMPAC 2024 exercise. Royal Netherlands Air Force photo by Sergeant-majoor Cristian Schrik OR-7 Cristian Schrik Perhaps most remarkably, the support vessels will each be operated by a crew of 'at least eight sailors,' according to the Dutch Ministry of Defense. This compares with a complement of around 230 sailors on each of the De Zeven Provinci√´n class. Despite their diminutive size and minimal crew, the support vessels will be notably well armed. As an adjunct to the De Zeven Provinci√´n class, which is primarily an air defense frigate, the new vessels will be equipped with Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) Barak-ER medium- to long-range surface-to-air missiles. The latest iteration of the Barak series, the ER version can hit targets at ranges of up to 93 miles and at altitudes of close to 100,000 feet. The Barak-ER is designed to engage a wide range of aerial targets, including aircraft, sea-skimming and cruise missiles, drones, glide bombs, and ‚Äî as seen in the video below ‚Äî tactical ballistic missiles. The Barak-ER is normally loaded in eight-round vertical launchers, and it was selected by the Netherlands in favor of the MBDA Aster, which cannot be fired from a container, and the Rafael Stunner, which reportedly failed to meet Dutch requirements. Meanwhile, production of the Standard Missile 2 (SM-2) Block IIIA that arms the De Zeven Provinci√´n class will soon come to an end, with the subsequent SM-2 Block IIICU not being compatible with the frigates‚Äô fire-control systems. While this raises questions about the future armament of the De Zeven Provinci√´n class, once stocks of SM-2 Block IIIA missiles are expired or expended, it led to the decision to fit Israeli-supplied air defense missiles on the support vessels. At the same time, the Barak-ER missiles on these ships will be fully compatible with the De Zeven Provinci√´n class, meaning that the frigates can be responsible for target detection and targeting, commanding missile launches from the smaller vessels, which will effectively serve as additional floating magazine capacity. Official concept artwork of the new vessel shows the aft deck loaded with four containers, apparently for missiles, with six launch tubes in each. There are also two stacked containers at the far end of the boat, perhaps containing support equipment or electronics. HNLMS Tromp (F803) fires an SM-2 missile. Dutch Ministry of Defense RICHARD FRIGGE In a letter to parliament yesterday, Dutch State Secretary for Defense Gijs Tuinman shed more light on the concept of operations, describing the support vessel or vessels sailing 'at a short distance' from the air defense frigate, with missiles being 'launched from the support vessel [but] controlled by the frigate.' The need to boost Dutch naval air defense coverage was made clear by the campaign against Houthi missiles and drones targeting shipping in the Middle East in recent months, as well as Iran‚Äôs unprecedented, massed attack on Israel, using the same kinds of weapons. In particular, the limited stock of air defense missiles found on most warships has emerged as a concern and one that the support vessels will help address. Developments elsewhere in the world, including in China, suggest that swarming drones as well as ever more capable missiles will be a feature of naval warfare from now on. As well as air defense, the support vessels will be able to deliver fire support during amphibious operations, for which they will be armed with ship-launched Harop long-range loitering munitions, also supplied by IAI. With an endurance of up to nine hours, the Harop is designed to hunt high-value targets including unmanned surface vessels, command posts, supply depots, armored vehicles, and air defense systems. It patrols a designated area, seeking out targets with its electro-optical seeker, overseen by a ‚Äòhuman-in-the-loop,‚Äô before attacking. The addition of loitering munitions on warships of different kinds is something that has recently gained some traction and the many benefits have also been addressed in the past by the TWZ. With the Netherlands Marine Corps as one of the four Dutch armed forces, the country has long stressed amphibious capabilities and the acquisition of Harop loitering munitions is indicative of the increasing challenges faced by such operations. In particular, coastlines are now better defended, with enemies possessing long-range weapons and advanced sensors that can threaten amphibious landing forces. This also means the Dutch Armed Forces need to be better able to launch amphibious assaults at different locations simultaneously.

U.S. Marine Corps photo by Lance Cpl. Eric Dmochowski Lance Cpl. Eric Dmochowski The Harop is part of wider Dutch investments in long-range strike capabilities. As we have discussed in the recent past, the Dutch are planning to acquire conventionally armed Tomahawk cruise missiles for their next class of submarines, as well as the AGM-158B Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range, or JASSM-ER, for its F-35A stealth fighters, and the Israeli-made PULS (Precise and Universal Launch System) multiple rocket launcher for the Royal Dutch Army. A Dutch F-35A brandishing AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles during a NATO air policing drill. Bartek Bera Another role that is being specified for the support vessels is as ‚Äòmotherships‚Äô for uncrewed underwater vehicles (UUVs). Tuinman described using such drones to monitor and identify suspicious activity in the North Sea. Nefarious underwater activity by Russia, or other hostile actors is a growing worry for NATO. Oil and gas drilling platforms and pipelines, wind turbines, and power and data cables are among the key assets that the new vessels and attendant UUVs should help protect. The type of underwater drones to be acquired has not yet been confirmed, but they will be existing, off-the-shelf designs with long-range sensors. In 2021, undersea sensors off the coast of northern Norway that are used to collect data about passing submarines, among other things, were knocked out, and the following year an undersea fiberoptic cable located between mainland Norway and the Svalbard archipelago in the Arctic Ocean was also put out of action. Earlier this year, a critical communications cable associated with Evenes Air Station, in northern Norway was severed, although it‚Äôs not clear if that was also underwater when cut. Perhaps most prominently, in 2022, sabotage was put forward as the most likely reason for the mysterious gas leaks that struck two undersea pipelines in the Baltic Sea, after several explosions in the area. The leaks affected the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines, used to carry gas from Russia to Europe and which were at the center of an ‚Äòenergy war‚Äô between Moscow and the West since Russia‚Äôs full-scale invasion of Ukraine. One of the Nord Stream gas leaks photographed from a Danish F-16 fighter jet. Danish Armed Forces While the North Sea has apparently been spared incidents like these so far, it‚Äôs clear that the Netherlands is very aware of the potential for Russian-inspired aggression in these waters, including underwater activities. The defense ministry points to an episode this summer, when the Royal Netherlands Navy escorted a Russian research vessel in Dutch waters, with the intelligence services suspecting that the Russian ship was investigating opportunities for potential future sabotage. Overall, the Netherlands is now more heavily investing in underwater warfare capabilities, after years of neglect. As you can read about here, the Netherlands will also buy four new conventionally powered submarines from France, to replace its Cold War-era Walrus class and to contribute to its new-look defense posture. An artist‚Äôs impression of the future class of conventionally powered submarines for the Royal Dutch Navy. Dutch Ministry of Defense Returning to the new support ships, these will also be expected to 'jam an opponent‚Äôs radar systems,' with IAI also delivering unspecified electronic warfare equipment for the new boats. In particular, the boats‚Äô electronic warfare capabilities will be expected to disrupt operations by hostile missiles and drones, suggesting that some kind of non-kinetic anti-drone system might also be installed. The small hull size means the ships won‚Äôt necessarily be truly multi-role but will instead have their weapons and perhaps also sensors packed in containers that can be easily swapped out. In this way, launch containers for Barak-ER missiles, for example, can be exchanged for those with Harop loitering munitions. Meanwhile, the fact that the primary ship has control of its weapons is a big advantage, reducing crew requirements and overall cost and complexity. The two new support vessels will be built by the Dutch shipyard Damen, with plans calling for the first to begin service as soon as 2026, with both vessels to be fully operational in 2027. The North Sea: The destroyer USS Forrest Sherman (DDG-98) conducts maneuvering drills with Italian aircraft carrier Giuseppe Garibaldi (C551) and units from Standing NATO Maritime Group (SNMG) 1 including German replenishment oiler Berlin (A1411), Royal Danish Navy frigate HDMS Peter Willermoes (F362), Royal Netherlands Navy frigate HNLMS Van Amstel (F831), and German corvette Erfurt (F262), on March 3, 2022. U.S. Navy photo by Naval Air Crewman (Helicopter) 2nd Class Reuben Richardson Lt.j.g. Kathleen Barrios Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the support vessels will be their use as a stepping-stone toward fully uncrewed operations by large-size surface vessels. With a crew of potentially a dozen sailors or less, these are already very nearly uncrewed surface vessels. Although the Dutch Ministry of Defense admits that the current technology doesn‚Äôt allow fully autonomous vessels, that is surely only a matter of time, and experience gained with these sparsely crewed ships should pave the way for that next frontier. In many ways, the Dutch support vessels mirror interest in the United States and other countries in large uncrewed surface vessels with modular weapons payloads, allowing them to be adapted for a range of missions as required. At the same time, having a minimally crewed ‚Äòloyal wingman‚Äô-type ship also makes a lot of sense, especially since the ship and crew can be reconfigured based on operational requirements. Across the board, the Dutch Armed Forces are strengthening and modernizing as they adapt to the changing security environment in Europe and further afield. The two new support vessels represent a very interesting design, aiming to put a useful amount of defensive and offensive firepower and surveillance capabilities on a small and relatively inexpensive hull, with very little in the way of a crew to support these systems, but to have them work closely with more traditional warships. If successful, they may well pave the way for truly uncrewed surface combatants of similar size and capabilities.

Russia Poised To Capture Key Eastern Ukraine City	Surrounded on three sides by Russian forces, the city of Vuhledar in Ukraine's eastern region of Donetsk is on the verge of being captured after nearly three years of holding out. The long-fought-over city in the southeastern part of Donetsk was once home to about 14,000 people but now is a burnt-out wasteland after years of Russian assaults. It is another important linchpin in Ukraine‚Äôs defense of the region and its fall - which seems imminent - imperils the southern flank of Pokrovsk. As we have written many times, it is a key logistics hub ensconced by highways and bisected by a major rail line.

Vuhledar is semi-encircled, Col. Vladyslav Seleznyov, former head of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) General Staff press service, told the Kyiv Post. 'My prediction is that we will lose it in a few days, maybe even sooner,' he said, adding that Russian troops have entered an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmulti-story buildings. In January and February 2023, the 72nd Mechanized Brigade of the AFU 'outnumbered and defeated Russian troops near Vuhledar, and has been defending this section of the front for two years,' the Kyiv Post noted. The 72nd is severely exhausted, Seleznyov said, and it remains uncertain whether the AFU‚Äôs General Staff has the resources to continue defending the city, given that Ukrainian forces are stretched thin across the entire front line. It was a morning in Vuhledar. The situation is critical, but the soldiers of the 72nd Brigade continue to hold the line. pic.twitter.com/No1aAOCvks&mdash; WarTranslated (Dmitri) (@wartranslated) September 24, 2024 Seleznyov's assessment of Vuhledar matches that of Ukrainian-born, pro-Russian military blogger Yuri Podolyaka. 'Russian units have entered Vuhledar ‚Äì the storming of the town has begun,' he said in a post on Telegram on Sept. 23. The latest map from the open-source intelligence gathering group DeepState shows that Russian forces have to the edges of the city. Russia has almost encircled Vuhledar, about 35 miles south of Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine. (DeepState) The assault on Vuhledar has come with a heavy cost for Russia, losing a significant amount of troops and equipment over the past three years. Meanwhile, about 35 miles to the north, Russian troops continue to press toward Pokrovsk, but with limited gains over the past week. There are several other Donetsk cities in peril because of the Russian advance, including Toretsk. For Ukraine, on its heels across the 600-mile front lines, there was a modicum of good news. Ukrainian Intelligence Directorate (GUR) forces say they recaptured a large factory located in the bombed-out city of Vovchansk in Kharkiv Oblast. That's some 160 miles to the north of Vuhledar Russian troops have been holed up there since June. 'It was a difficult battle, but the soldiers of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine overcame the Russian invaders and won an important victory - with the strength of arms and spirit, mastery of thought and unprecedented courage,' GUR said on Twitter Tuesday. –í–æ–≤—á–∞–Ω—Å—å–∫–∏–π –∞–≥—Ä–µ–≥–∞—Ç–Ω–∏–π –∑–∞–≤–æ–¥ ‚Äî –ø—ñ–¥ –∫–æ–Ω—Ç—Ä–æ–ª–µ–º –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏! –¶–µ –±—É–ª–∞ –≤–∞–∂–∫–∞ –±–∏—Ç–≤–∞, –∞–ª–µ –≤–æ—ó–Ω–∏ –ì–£–† –ú–û –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏ –∑–¥–æ–ª–∞–ª–∏ —Ä–æ—Å—ñ–π—Å—å–∫–∏—Ö –∑–∞–≥–∞—Ä–±–Ω–∏–∫—ñ–≤ —ñ –∑–¥–æ–±—É–ª–∏ –≤–∞–∂–ª–∏–≤—É –ø–µ—Ä–µ–º–æ–≥—É ‚Äî —Å–∏–ª–æ—é –∑–±—Ä–æ—ó —ñ –¥—É—Ö—É, –º–∞–π—Å—Ç–µ—Ä–Ω—ñ—Å—Ç—é –¥—É–º–∫–∏ —Ç–∞ –Ω–µ–±—É–≤–∞–ª–æ—é —Å–º—ñ–ª–∏–≤—ñ—Å—Ç—é. –ß–µ—Å—Ç—å —Ö–æ—Ä–æ–±—Ä–∏–º! pic.twitter.com/bcBMFjlEhj&mdash; Defence intelligence of Ukraine (@DI_Ukraine) September 24, 2024 –ü—ñ–¥—Ä–æ–∑–¥—ñ–ª–∏ –ì–£–† –∑–≤—ñ–ª—å–Ω–∏–ª–∏ –≤—ñ–¥ –æ–∫—É–ø–∞–Ω—Ç—ñ–≤ –í–æ–≤—á–∞–Ω—Å—å–∫–∏–π –∞–≥—Ä–µ–≥–∞—Ç–Ω–∏–π –∑–∞–≤–æ–¥ —Ç–∞ –∑–Ω–∏—â–∏–ª–∏ –æ–∫—É–ø–∞–Ω—Ç—ñ–≤ –≤ —É—Å—ñ—Ö –±—É–¥—ñ–≤–ª—è—Ö –ø—ñ–¥–ø—Ä–∏—î–º—Å—Ç–≤–∞. pic.twitter.com/TLdNNFIWN2&mdash; Defence intelligence of Ukraine (@DI_Ukraine) September 24, 2024 For Ukraine, whatever joy can be gleaned from the victory in Vovchansk is outweighed by the sting of the impending loss of Vuhledar.

First Look At Mystery Object Shot Down Over Canada By F-22 Raptor...	Canadian authorities have released an image of an unidentified object that was shot down over the country's Yukon Territory by a U.S. Air Force F-22 Raptor stealth fighter in February 2023. This is the first image of any of a trio of still-unidentified objects that were downed over the United States and Canada that month, details about which remain scant. The new disclosure continues to raise more questions about those incidents given that the picture appears to have been declassified within days of the shootdown, but was then withheld from release until now. Canada's CTV News first published the image of what is also known as Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) 23, seen at the top of this story and below, along with an accompanying string of partially redacted internal emails from members of the Canadian armed forces earlier today. UAP is the term U.S., Canadian, and other authorities currently use to refer to what have been commonly described as unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the past. The outlet said it independently verified the records after recieving them from an unnamed source who had obtained them via an Access to Information request. Canada's Access to Information Act is similar in many respects to the U.S. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), but the former is only accessible to Canadian citizens. Canadian DND via Access to Information Request Via CTV News UAP 23 was downed over the Yukon on February 11, 2023. This came two days after another unidentified object, also known as UAP 20, was shot down in U.S. airspace off the northern coast of Alaska. A shootdown of a third unidentified object as it passed over Lake Huron came on February 12. This all followed U.S. and Canadian authorities tracking a Chinese spy balloon passing through their airspace for days before deciding to destroy it as it soared out over the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of South Carolina on February 4. The very low-resolution and grainy image we now have of UAP 23 shows a broadly doughnut-like shape with an open center, as well as an apparent notch or gap in its circumference on one side. It is possible that what is seen is light reflecting only from certain parts and that what is visible is not truly representative of its full shape. The quality of the picture, which CTV News notes 'appears to be a photocopy of an email printout,' makes it impossible to discern any definitive details. 'The image appears to have been taken from an aircraft below it, although that has not been confirmed,' CTV News' report adds. 'The best description we have is: Visual ‚Äì a cylindrical object. The top quarter is metallic, remainder white. 20 foot wire hanging below with a package of some sort suspended from it,' one of the associated emails, dated February 11, 2023, says. Looking at the released picture again with this description in hand it looks like it might show a balloon catching the sun with a payload underneath. At the time, Canadian authorities described what had been shot down over the Yukon as a 'small, cylindrical object.' An F-22 Raptor stealth fighter, like the one seen here, shot down UAP 23 over the Yukon on February 11, 2023. USAF Senior Airman Julia Lebens 'It is unknown whether it [UAP 23] poses an armed threat or has intelligence collection capabilities,' according to a memo provided to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on February 15, 2023, says. 'The area in which the impact [after shootdown] occurred is a known (caribou) migration route, which opens the possibility of future accidental discovery by Indigenous hunters.' CTV News published the heavily redacted document, which it also received from an unarmed source who obtained it first via an Access to Information request, in September 2023. The release of the memo had already raised new and still largely unanswered questions about what Canadian and U.S. authorities may or may not know about the trio of downed objects, as well as what other UAPs had been monitored in either country's airspace before then, as you can read more about here. No remains of any of the three still-unidentified objects brought down in February 2023 are known to have been recovered. The owners and/or operators of those objects, and whatever their purposes might have been, remain unknown, at least publicly. Past reports have suggested UAP 23, specifically, may have been a so-called 'pico' balloon often launched by amateur radio enthusiasts. U.S. officials subsequently said that the trio of objects appeared to be benign, which looks to have been a direct factor in withholding the image of UAP 23 from the public. The unredacted portions of the newly disclosed Emails, which you can find here, show a clear push between February 11 and February 15, 2023, including from then-Canadian Chief of the Defense Staff Gen. Wayne Eyre, to not only declassify the image, but also proactively release it, including on social media. However, by the end of February 15, the emails have taken a decidedly different tone. Then-Canadian Chief of Defense Staff Gen. Wayne Eyre, at left, walks with Vice Chief of Space Operations Gen. David Thompson, at right, during a visit to the Pentagon in November 2023. USAF Eric Dietrich 'Should the image be released, it would be via the CAF [Canadian Armed Forces] social media accounts,' Taylor Paxton, then-acting Assistant Deputy Minister for Public Affairs with Canada's Department of National Defense, writes in one Email. 'Given the current public environment and statements related to the object being benign, releasing the image may create more questions/confusion, regardless of the text that will accompany the post.' Major Doug Keirstead, Public Affairs Officer to Chief of the Defense Staff, subsequently sent another Email to his boss, Gen. Eyre, reiterating advice from acting Assistant Deputy Minister Taylor, as well as others, to hold off on releasing the image 'pending U.S. engagement.' The War Zone has reached out to the U.S. Office of the Secretary of Defense and the U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) for more information. If the goal behind not releasing this image and any others from the Febraury 2023 shootdowns was to avoid confusion and speculation, it only appears to have had the opposite impact. The War Zone, along with others, has tried to obtain imagery from these incidents from the U.S. side on multiple occasions to no avail and we have called into question the puzzling optics of not doing so in the past. Amazing how quickly they declassified the MQ-9's MTS-B sensor footage of the Su-27 collision but we still haven't even gotten a single still frame of the 3 objects NORAD shot down over North America during the great balloon hunt. Quite telling.&mdash; Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) March 16, 2023 Even before February 2023, many members of Congress in the United States with access to classified information had criticized and otherwise called into question the U.S. military's attitude towards UAP issues, broadly. The Department of Defense did establish an All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) in 2022 as a focal point for tracking and investigating all things UAP, but significant questions have been raised since about its resourcing and authorities. There have also been as yet unsubstantiated accusations of AARO and others within the U.S. government engaging in more active coverups. 'Data release and footage is prioritized based on the geopolitical environment at the time,' then-head of AARO Sean Kirkpatrick said in response to a question from The War Zone about why imagery from the February shootdowns had not been released at a press briefing in October 2023. 'So engagements with Chinese fighters, Russian fighters have a much larger priority in getting it through the review process or declassification than UAPs or other similar engagements.' 'We are however, working through those processes, which all exist and we‚Äôve got several of them actually already declassified and ready to update on our website [which] we‚Äôll be doing on the next update to the website,' Kirkpatrick, who left AARO in December 2023, added at that time. 'And we‚Äôre putting them out as quickly as we can get them through their proper steps.' In a report released earlier this year, the Department of Defense's own Office of the Inspector General (DODIG) went so far as to warn that a continued 'lack of a comprehensive, coordinated approach to address' UAP issues 'may pose a threat to military forces and national security.' The War Zone has repeatedly highlighted the significant evidence that a substantial number of UAP sightings are not only explainable, but are likely drones, high-altitude balloons, and other uncrewed aerial assets that hostile actors are using to gather intelligence on critical capabilities and installations in and round the United States. A more recent Congressional effort to push for more UAP transparency through an amendment to the annual defense policy bill, or National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), for the 2025 Fiscal Year looks to have collapsed, at least for now.

F-35 Shown Carrying Stealthy Long-Range Anti-Ship Missiles For Th...	The Pentagon has, for the first time, released a photo showing an F-35 stealth fighter carrying an AGM-158C Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM). The stealthy standoff weapon, which is a derivative of the AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), will provide the F-35 with a powerful anti-surface warfare capability, something that will be especially important for a potential future high-end conflict in the Pacific against China. The photo was published today by the U.S. Department of Defense and shows a test flight out of NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, on September 10. A pair of LRASMs are seen on the inboard underwing pylons of a carrier-capable F-35C variant, assigned to the Pax River F-35 Integrated Test Force. An earlier rendering of an F-35 variant with a pair of AGM-158C LRASM missiles under its wings. Lockheed Martin 'As part of ongoing integration efforts, the Pax River F-35 Integrated Test Force (Pax ITF) team flew two days of test flights to evaluate flutter, loads, and flying qualities with two AGM-158 loaded on external stations,' the accompanying caption reads. 'LRASM is a defined near-term solution for the Offensive Anti-Surface Warfare (OASuW) air-launch capability gap that will provide flexible, long-range, advanced, anti-surface capability against high-threat maritime targets.' The description of the stores as AGM-158s doesn‚Äôt rule out the possibility of versions of the baseline JASSM, but either way they are test articles, with the LRASM having the same mold line as the JASSM. An AGM-158C Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) in flight. USAF An AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) in flight. USAF As well as the F-35C, LRASM will be integrated onto the short takeoff and vertical landing F-35B variant. LRASM ‚Äî like JASSM ‚Äî cannot be carried internally by any F-35 variant. Externally carriage has an adverse effect on the aircraft‚Äôs stealth, but this is considered a reasonable price to pay for the weapons long-range precision attack capabilities and its own low-observable characteristics that make it highly survivable. As we have described in the past, LRASM uses a GPS-assisted inertial navigation system (INS) guidance system and careful route planning to bring it to the vicinity of the target area. On its way there, the weapon uses its highly adaptive routing capability, which allows it to automatically change course in response to ‚Äòpop-up‚Äô air defense threats. Those threats, in turn, are detected using LRASM‚Äôs built-in electronic support measures (ESM) package. Other threat updates are provided from external sources, via a datalink, which can allow for LRASMs to work cooperatively for coordinated strikes. Once the missile arrives in the target area, it activates an imaging infrared (IIR) seeker for the terminal phase of flight. The seeker searches for targets and autonomously classifies them using pre-programmed parameters that are stored in its threat target library database. The advanced seeker also ensures that the missile strikes the ship at its most vulnerable point. Since the seeker is passive, it can‚Äôt be detected by hostile ships, and it cannot be countered using radio-frequency jamming. Previously, there were plans for LRASM to also have the ability to strike targets ashore, but the Navy announced earlier this year that it had abandoned plans for this subvariant, as you can read about here. However, there are further improvements to LRASM in the pipeline. The AGM-158C-3 version ‚Äî which once would have had land-attack capability ‚Äî will include new software, enhanced beyond-line-of-sight data link, and improved survivability. Importantly, it will also have a range in line with that of the AGM-158B JASSM-ER ‚Äî reportedly in the region of 600 miles. This compares with a range of between 200 and 300 miles for the baseline JASSM and LRASM, based on publicly available information. Until LRASM is cleared for carriage by the F-35, the Navy‚Äôs F/A-18E/F Super Hornets are currently the service‚Äôs only aircraft capable of employing variants of the missile. Integration efforts are also addressing other Navy platforms, including P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft. Here are the first images showing the #LRASM (Long Range Anti-Ship Missile) fitted on a P-8A Poseidon Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA) Naval News (@navalnewscom) April 4, 2023 The Air Force‚Äôs B-1B bombers can also launch LRASMs. LRASM is a big deal for the F-35, which currently lacks any dedicated anti-ship missile ‚Äî at least until the full integration of the Norwegian-designed Joint Strike Missile (JSM), which can be carried internally, but is a multi-role land attack missile with anti-ship capabilities. While LRASM will provide the F-35B/C with a significant capability, it will ultimately serve as part of a mix of advanced anti-ship weapons, including hypersonic ones. Noteworthy is the fact that the AGM-158C-3 was originally developed under the OASuW Inc 2 program, which has since evolved into the Hypersonic Air-Launched Offensive Anti-Surface Warfare missile, or HALO. An artist‚Äôs conception of F/A-18F Super Hornets releasing hypersonic missiles. Boeing via Aviation Week As of earlier this year, it was planned for HALO to attain initial operational capability in Fiscal Year 2029. Although it will first be integrated onto the F/A-18E/F, it will likely subsequently be added to the F-35. The current efforts to integrate the baseline LRASM on the F-35 reflect a Pentagon-wide focus on the acquisition of new and improved anti-ship capabilities. With eyes on future contingencies in the Indo-Pacific region, we are currently seeing considerable interest in the development and fielding of a host of new ground-based surface-to-surface missile systems with anti-ship capabilities, as well as air-launched weapons like LRASM.

What Would A Far Cheaper Next Generation Air Dominance Fighter Ac...	The Air Force's long-touted 6th generation Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) crewed 'fighter' program is under deep review, with massive revisions to what the service wants out of it being a real possibility at this point. After originally stating this very advanced aircraft that would sit as the centerpiece of the NGAD family of systems would cost roughly three times that of a new F-35 (upwards of $300M plus each), Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall is now eying pursuing a far less expensive aircraft, one that will cost around what a fresh F-35 or F-15EX does, which is very roughly around $90M-$100M apiece. At the Air & Space Forces Association's 2024 Air, Space, Cyber conference outside of Washington, D.C. last week, Secretary Kendall told reporters, including TWZ's Howard Altman, that the reevaluation of what the USAF wants out of the NGAD crewed jet is underway and by his own words, the resulting changes could be dramatic: 'I'll just give you this off the top of my head here, that the F-35 kind of represents, to me, the upper bounds of what we'd like to pay for an individual [NGAD] aircraft for that mission. &#8230; The F 15EX and F-35 are roughly in the same cost category. I'd like to go lower though. There are - once you start integrating CCAs and transferring some mission equipment and capabilities [and] functions to the CCAs, then you can talk about a different concept, potentially, for the crewed fighter that's controlling them. So there's a real range in there. We need a unit cost that's affordable in significant numbers, though. So that's part of the equation. And, I mean, NGAD [the original combat jet concept] itself is still a possibility. It's one of the things we're looking at. But the numbers there are, you know, as I've said in public before, they're multiples of an F-35 right? So we'd like to get down from that. But if that turns out to be the most cost effective operational answer, that's what we're gonna do and go fight for the money to have it. You end up with small numbers. I mean, the more the airplane costs, the fewer of them you're gonna have. Numbers do matter. So it's a trade off.' So what could a 6th generation fighter that costs one-third of the original NGAD requirements actually look like? Is it even possible? Let's get into it. Decentralizing/distributing to the extreme As we have discussed for years, the crewed NGAD component was being designed from the ground up as a central part of an ecosystem of next-generation tactical air combat technologies. These include above all else Collaborative Combat Aircraft 'loyal wingmen' drones, but also new weapons, communications architectures, sensors, engines, and more. They could also include other types of undisclosed drones, but more advanced, independent-operating, deep-penetrating types of the tactical variety don't seem to be even on the table at this time. You can read more about that in our recent reporting here. One advantage of such a 'family of systems' is that critical features that had to be on every single fighter of the same type in the past can be distributed across multiple platforms. For instance, if the goal is just about getting a human in the loop within line-of-sight to control CCAs and manage the tactical ballet, the fighter could have no radar or any other types of sensors of its own. Instead, radars, infrared search and track systems (IRST), and electronic support measures, as well as electronic warfare capabilities, could be dispersed to modular CCAs and potentially other platforms in their vicinity. Some of these functions could even provided by space-based platforms/constellations and data-linked to the aircraft in real time. While this may be possible, it's very risky and it takes the distributed sensor concept to the extreme. It also severely limits the aircraft's applications when CCAs are not in use. It still would be prudent to give the fighter some independent sensing capabilities, perhaps a single radar array for use cooperatively with other platforms and as a fallback for certain tactical contingencies ‚Äî more on that in a minute. A far more elaborate installation of cutting-edge multi-mode arrays distributed around or even made part of the airframe itself may not be within the cost limitations of a revised NGAD fighter program. You can read all about this capability here. Still, the NGAD fighter relying more heavily on CCAs for these functions has some upside. These drones will fly closer to targeted threat areas anyway and they will be data-linked together, allowing for cooperative sensing tactics and a higher degree of triangulation of targets, which in many cases would provide superior fidelity and more resilient sensor data. This is exactly the distributed payload concept we described in great detail back in 2016 and the USAF has become increasingly focused on it as of late. Aircraft like the XQ-67 Off-Board Sensing Station (OBSS) appear to be a trial platform for just this kind of sensor-carrying tactical drone, for instance, but CCAs will be capable of being configured for these roles, as well. Still, by relying on distributed sensor and electronic warfare payloads for CCAs more heavily, the NGAD fighter will be less capable on its own, especially in a very high-end fight. This would mean that the drone and crewed fighter will be tied even closer together operationally, with the fighter depending on them and the networking that connects to them even more heavily for tactical success. There are also logistical and attrition concerns with such a bet, but a balance more heavily weighted toward CCA when it comes to sensor and electronic warfare system deployment is more likely than going to the extreme end of the distributed concept and stripping the manned aircraft of most or even all of its sensors. While removing advanced sensors and electronic warfare gear from an aircraft, or replacing these systems with simpler options, would definitely save on cost and it could help reduce the size of airframe itself, where the cost really comes into play is payload, range, and speed. Payload reduction NGAD was always largely thought to be a heavy interceptor-like aircraft, featuring a comparatively very large combat radius that is optimized for fighting in the Pacific where tankers will be pushed back beyond the range of most fighter aircraft to their target areas, at least early in a conflict. It would also have to carry a large payload of diverse weaponry internally so that it can maintain its low-observable (stealth) abilities that would be critical to its survival while also delivering a heavy punch deep inside contested airspace. Just for the air dominance role, not deep strike, a large number of air-to-air and suppression/destruction of enemy air defenses (SEAD/DEAD) weapons would be needed for the aircraft to fight its way in and out of an area where external support would be extremely limited. Two factors could drastically change this calculus. The concept of a very heavy NGAD 'fighter' aircraft may be numbered. (Collins) The first is a much heavier reliance on CCAs for standard weapons carriage and on other platforms for larger, outsized weapons delivery. Putting the magazine depth focus more on drones instead of the central controlling platform could drastically reduce the size of aircraft needed to perform the mission. It could be argued that it would also provide a greater degree of survivability in some situations as the crewed asset would not have to (or even have a reason to in some cases) get within launch distance of many threats. Instead, the CCAs almost exclusively would, with the fighter element hanging even further back at a safer distance than originally planned. Such tactics could also become more pressing as enemy air defense capabilities continue to evolve, specifically when it comes to fusing information from various sensors to spot even very stealthy aircraft at a distance. A massive reduction in payload requirement and likely the inclusion of more CCAs on a typical mission would also allow for more tactical flexibility in some instances. Larger weapons, such as very long-range air-to-air missiles, could be carried by assets like the B-21 Raider deeper into contested environments, while F-15EXs and B-52s could do the same along the outer edge of higher-threat areas, at least in some situations. These aircraft could launch these weapons on demand of the crewed NGAD fighter operating far forward. It could even be argued that funds set aside for a very costly NGAD fighter could be partially invested in buying additional B-21s and even F-15EXs to support NGAD-related air dominance missions. B-21 Raider undergoing flight test. (USAF) Giancarlo Casem Reducing the payload requirements of the NGAD fighter would reduce the complexity and size of the fighter platform. This could save a lot of money, as everything from the propulsion requirements to the physical size of the airframe would be decreased. This is not to say such a configuration would be unarmed. Still, reducing its weapons bay size to carry say a quartet of AIM-120s or AIM-260s, along with a pair of AIM-9X Sidewinders or four Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) sized air-to-ground weapons, could be enough for contingencies and for mundane operations in less contested airspace, such as in the Middle East, where CCAs may not even be a factor for normal missions. Less gas An even bigger factor is fuel. It is valid to assume that the original NGAD concept placed fuel carriage as a premium design driver. This aircraft had to fly far from tanker support, into the enemy's anti-access bubble and back in order to be relevant. Now the USAF is increasingly aggressive about fielding a stealthy tanker that can operate at least at the very edge of contested airspace. America's tactical airpower was not built for fighting over long distances without tanker support being in relatively close proximity. Its fighters have combat radii roughly between 350 and 850 miles or so. This puts the tankers at risk as an enemy's anti-access bubble can now extend many hundreds and even thousands of miles from its territory. NGAD and CCAs, which will have significantly larger combat radii than current fighter aircraft, were viewed as a way to correct for this huge capability gap, but if the USAF is now moving to build a stealth tanker, the need for a much longer-ranged 6th generation crewed tactical jet could be offset to some degree. TWZ made the case for a stealth tanker years ago based on all these issues and more. At the time many blew it off as fantasy. This is no longer the case as the factors that dictate the need for such a capability have only grown more pressing in recent years as the U.S. military faces a potential massive fight in the Pacific with China and as air defenses become ever-more sophisticated and longer-ranged. The USAF is now accelerating its next-generation tanker initiatives with an increasing focus on fielding low-observable tankers, which it just said will be directly tied to its final NGAD plans. So, if the USAF is willing to assume a lot more risk while also committing to fast-tracking a stealthy tanker, it could possibly justify a NGAD fighter with a significantly smaller combat radius and shrink the cost and complexity of the airframe even further. A notional tanker concept with low-observable characteristics. (Lockheed Martin Skunk Works) Slower and lower Then there are the kinematic performance concessions that could be made with a revised NGAD design. In a previous thought piece, we explored the possible performance targets of the crewed NGAD component. You can check that feature out here. Regardless, the ability to fly higher and faster for longer periods of time, even while deeply sacrificing maneuverability, are likely design drivers. Sustained supercruise (flying over Mach 1 without the use of afterburner) and higher ceilings while also not guzzling precious fuel come at a heavy cost. The F-22, for instance, is well known for its supercruise capability, but it still zaps the jet's endurance and is used for high-risk tactical portions of a mission, not for regularly transiting longer distances faster. Flying at higher altitudes, like the F-22 which can operate normally at altitudes in excess of 60,000 feet, is also a major plus. Just the ability to give sensors and datalinks a much longer line-of-sight is a big plus, as is the additional range imparted onto weapons fired at those altitudes. By relaxing high or even breakthrough performance requirements, with all the material science and development costs that goes with it, an airframe could drop in complexity and cost fairly dramatically. A notional NGAD-like fighter. (Boeing via Air &#038; Space Forces) Maybe above all else, reducing the goals of NGAD's next-generation engine initiative, the Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion (NGAP) program, alongside reductions in performance targets could also save a lot of money, both in development costs and eventual production expenditures. Using a derivative of an existing powerplant, and a single one possibly instead of two, would be even one step further in cost reduction, but with all this would come degraded performance and less advancement in engine technologies, which is a real concern long-term. Barrow everything you can Borrowing existing subsystems more deeply could also save a lot of money and development time. For instance, leveraging and adapting the F-35's Block IV digital backbone and software, as well as even some sensors and communications systems, and scaling in or out other features, could result in a large acceleration of the program and reduction in cost. It would also benefit from large economies of scale baked into the F-35 program, as well as its existing expansive sustainment infrastructure that will exist for decades. There is a real push for the USAF to retain rights to the NGAD aircraft's intellectual property and not be locked into one vendor. Deeply adapting a partially off-the-shelf architecture may not be able to achieve this goal, but it could be seen as a worthy trade if deep cost-cutting up-front is seen as more important. An F-35A in flight above the Mojave Desert in California, January 6, 2023. A developmental test team from the 461st Flight Test Squadron conducted the first flight of an F-35 in the Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) configuration at Edwards Air Force Base, California. TR-3 is the hardware backbone that will enable the aircraft's long-awaited Block IV upgrades. (412th Test Wing) F-35 Joint Program Office When paired with major performance reductions, mechanical subsystems could also be more easily carried over from other platforms to the 'cheap' NGAD fighter concept. There is a long track record of this in the past, especially with smaller-run aircraft, like the F-117, and experimental aircraft. But it is also worth noting that it is well known that the B-21 program strategically leveraged a mix of mature and semi-mature subsystems to speed development and keep costs on track. The USAF would be clearly keen on this practice considering the B-21's success thus far. Leaving breakthrough capabilities behind Having a new aircraft with every bell and whistle possible is becoming less realistic as costs of new weapons systems and the dollars needed to sustain them skyrockets. This means that some major new features that were planned for the $300M NGAD fighter may not make the cut. Even having the capacity to install them in the future could also be left on the cutting room floor in an effort to make the aircraft affordable. One example of this kind of sacrifice could be laser weaponry, which was envisioned as a core feature of NGAD, but putting these systems on aircraft has since hit massive snags. The weight, volume, complexity, power generation and thermal management needed in order to field even a defensive laser system would be significant. As the airframe, payload and performance shrinks, this becomes a clearer mismatch and the technological hurdles that remain could be seen as major stumbling block for the program. Even the AC-130 has lost its laser weapon before it even arrived for a number of factors, but integrating a system like that onto a cargo aircraft is far less complex than an advanced stealth fighter. An earlier concept of a 6th generation manned tactical jet showing a laser weapon being fired. (Northrop Grumman) There are a number of other similar concepts that may have to remain aspirational or find their way onto other platforms so that an NGAD fighter can actually get built. Reductions in all these areas would absolutely result in a significantly cheaper aircraft, but it would also mean trading a massive amount of capability in the process, while also gambling even more heavily on the CCA concept, which still remains&#8230; a concept. Certainly, some will ask why not just use the F-35? This likely comes down to the most important factor on this rundown: survivability. Advanced shell, less advanced core What this airframe would likely retain in common with its three times more expensive progenitor option is a very high degree of broadband low-observability (stealth), allowing it to operate close to the core of highly advanced integrated air defense networks. A tailless new-generation stealth airframe could really be a primary feature. Putting a priority on efficient propulsion and minimizing weapons payload could still provide a notably larger combat radius than the F-35, although the F-35A and C are towards the top end of the existing fighter combat radius scale as it is. This aircraft's central goal could be refocused on keeping the human pilot alive and present far forward at the technical edge to employ CCAs and to leverage the rest of the NGAD ecosystem to achieve desired outcomes. Its ability as a long-range heavy fighter let alone strike aircraft for truly independent operations would be far more limited. It could rely more on future advances in ancillary and distributed technologies to remain relevant than purely its installed 'bleeding edge' capabilities. A notional 6th generation fighter. (Lockheed Martin) So what we could be talking about is a smaller, lighter, less armed, less independent, and shorter-ranged concept that still puts a premium on low-observable technologies. Interestingly, in some ways, such a switch would mirror what happened with the Next Generation Bomber (NGB). It was an absolute top-of-the-line design initiative that was later soft-cancelled and out of its ashes came the Long-Range Strike-Bomber (LRS-B) program. This was a far less ambitious initiative that focused heavily on cost and timeline controls, repurposing mature and semi-mature components and technologies, and rationalizing what is essential and what is not ‚Äî including payload ‚Äî and then wrapping it in a very stealthy next-generation broadband low-observable package. It too would also rely on a 'family of systems' made up of unique technologies and platforms to successfully complete its future missions. Does this sound familiar in relation to the changing messaging from the USAF brass on NGAD? It should. What's also interesting is the USAF abstractly floated a 6th generation light-to-medium fighter concept recently, although they just said it was a thought exercise, not indicative of a real plan. But even introducing such an idea, including concept art to support it, is an odd move when the service is focusing on getting all its top priorities met, including investments in F-35, F-15EX, NGAD, CCA, and especially incredibly costly nuclear modernization. It seems like there could be a bit more to that 'thought exercise' than what we were told, which is what we thought at the time. That doesn't mean a cheap NGAD fighter would look like what was shown, that really wouldn't make sense, but it certainly fits the general direction that is now formally on the table. Rendering regarding a thought experiment for a lighter next-generation fighter. (USAF) Even with this big cocktail of measures focused on drastically reducing the unit price of a future NGAD fighter aircraft, could it really be dropped to around $100M? It's tough to say. If most of what is described above was done to the maximum logical extent, it may be possible once the type hits full-rate production, if the latest in manufacturing techniques are brought to bear, as well. Still, that seems like a stretch, especially without increasing the buy far beyond the 200 airframes Kendall has floated before. If that number is drastically expanded, it would have a better chance of meeting that price target. Above all else, what we do know now is the flying service remains behind the curve and still uncertain of how it will maintain air supremacy in a rapidly changing security environment in which peer competition hasn't been as tangible as it is today for decades. Can the USAF really stay ahead of China by going the much cheaper route for its crewed NGAD component? Or is the better course to just focus on and broaden the uncrewed technology side of the portfolio and divert funds away from a crewed NGAD aircraft altogether? We will be addressing these larger issues in another future piece, but as it sits now, it sure seems like the NGAD fighter program could be about to change, and fairly dramatically so.

Navy Resupply Ship Mishap Could Have Big Impact On Mid-East Deplo...	An at-sea mishap involving the U.S. Navy's Military Sealift Command (MSC) oiler USNS Big Horn is highlighting concerns about the Navy‚Äôs ability to sustain itself given the limited number of such vessels. The issue is especially acute given that the Big Horn‚Äôs mission was to refuel the ships and aircraft in the Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group (CSG) now in the tumultuous U.S. Central Command region. The Big Horn 'was damaged while operating at sea in the U.S. Fifth Fleet area of operations overnight on Sept. 23,' a Navy official told The War Zone Tuesday morning. It‚Äôs not looking good. I‚Äôve been told by a shipowner the Navy does not have a spare oiler to deploy and is scrambling to find a commercial oil tanker to refuel the Abraham Lincoln carrier group.Updates over at gCaptain forum: pic.twitter.com/ec2oN3CpSf&mdash; John …Ö Konrad V (@johnkonrad) September 24, 2024 'All crew members are currently safe and U.S. 5th Fleet is assessing the situation,' said the official, adding that the Big Horn is currently being towed to an unspecified port in the region. A second Navy official told The War Zone that the damage to the Big Horn will likely take months to repair. The Big Horn was the only oiler in the region because the USNS Supply returned to port, that official confirmed. It arrived in Norfolk, Virginia in June as one of the last ships to return from a nine-month deployment with the Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group, according to WTKR TV. 'The Navy will have to move another [oiler] into the theater,' said the second official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss operational details. The mishap was first reported by John Konrad of GCapatain, who said the vessel ran aground off Oman. It comes at a critical juncture, with hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah heating up. That is sparking concerns of a wider conflict that could draw in the U.S., which is now planning to move additional troops into the region as a result, the Pentagon‚Äôs top spokesman, Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, told reporters on Monday. The Lincoln CSG arrived in the U.S. Central Command region late last month 'as part of broad adjustments to [the] U.S. military posture to ensure U.S. force protection, increase support for the defense of Israel and ensure the United States is prepared to respond to a wide range of contingencies,' said Pentagon Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh at the time. USS Abraham Lincoln departs Naval Station North Island on July 11, 2024. US Navy PhotoU.S. Navy As we noted in the past, the Dwight D. Eisenhower CSG had an extremely active seven-month deployment to the region before leaving in June. It fired nearly 800 munitions as it battled the Houthi rebels of Yemen and helping protect Israel against a massive missile and drone barrage from Iran. You can read more about that deployment from the viewpoint of the carrier's commander, Navy Capt. Chris 'Chowdah' Hill, in our interview here. A similarly high-tempo deployment for the Lincoln CSG could be adversely affected by the Big Horn now out of commission for a while, said the second Navy official, adding that it depends on what contingencies U.S. Naval Forces Central (NAVCENT) have in place. We reached out to NAVCENT and MSC for comment. MSC deferred questions to NAVCENT, which has yet to respond. We will update this story with any pertinent information provided. The temporary loss of the Big Horn 'could potentially constrain the level of air operations and ship operations' for the Lincoln CSG, Sal Mercogliano, a maritime historian, former Merchant Marine and host of the WGOW Shipping podcast, told The War Zone. 'They may have to send ships into port to refuel. What capacity exists for underway refueling would be reserved for the carrier.' The U.S. Military Support Command only has 14 Kaiser class oilers like the Big Horn and two Supply class oilers. Adding to the pressures are that five Kaiser class oilers are in shipyards while the remainder are spread out across the globe., Mercogliano pointed out. This week‚Äôs @mscsealift 'Ship in the Spotlight' is fleet replenishment oiler USNS Big Horn (T-AO 198). The vessel is providing logistic support to @USNavy and allied ships in the @US5thFleet. It has conducted several underway replenishments with Navy ships including @CVN_72. pic.twitter.com/BCmDbgJd8u&mdash; U.S. Navy's Military Sealift Command (@MSCSealift) September 16, 2024 While there are two replenishment ships in the region, they can carry only a small fraction of the fuel provided by the oilers, Mercogliano noted. Both the second Navy official and Mercogliano said that the Big Horn mishap will have effects beyond just the Lincoln CSG. 'This will have a cascading effect across the Navy,' said the second Navy official. 'Given the limited number of oilers, to have an unscheduled loss affects ships around the world, because she will have to be replaced for some period of time and there are only 14 of them.' US Navy Oiler Runs Aground, Forcing Carrier Strike Group to Scramble for Fuel I HATE THIS STORY. But what it demonstrates is the fragility of our maritime logistics system to support the fleet. With just 14 fleet oilers, 2 Supply class fast combat stores ships and 12 dry‚Ä¶&mdash; Sal Mercogliano (WGOW Shipping) (@mercoglianos) September 24, 2024 Retired Vice Adm. Willam A Brown, President of the National Defense Transportation Association (NDTA), expressed confidence in NAVCENT‚Äôs ability to sustain the Lincoln CSG. 'While this is a significant event, there are multiple options to refuel the carrier strike group‚Äîand NDTA is confident MSC, the US Navy and USTRANSCOM have options in their playbook to meet the highest demands which the strike group could meet,' Brown said in a statement to The War Zone. Even before the Big Horn mishap, there were major concerns about the Navy's ability to supply itself in a high-end fight against an adversary like China. Such a battle would take place over great swaths of ocean against an adversary with major anti-access/area-denial capabilities. Such a conflict would put a major strain on the small fleet of oilers. This is not even factoring in potential attrition of these ships which would be top targets for an adversary as taking them out would degrade a carrier strike group's capabilities significantly and reduce their tactical flexibility.

New Radar Sought To Help X-62A Test Jet Take Next Leap In Autonom...	The U.S. Air Force is interested in adding an active electronically-scanned array (AESA) radar to its X-62A test jet. The radar is part of larger plans to acquire a new modular sensor suite to further expand the capabilities of the uniquely modified F-16, which has already assumed a key role in advanced exploratory work for autonomous air combat drones. Following the announcement that the X-62A had taken part in a first-of-its-kind artificial intelligence-driven dogfight earlier this year, The War Zone highlighted how uninterrupted 360-degree situational awareness will be essential for truly making autonomous close-in air-to-air combat a reality. Air Force officials at Edwards Air Force Base first put out a call for information about potential AESA radar options for the X-62A back in August, but only stopped taking submissions last Friday. Also known as the Variable Stability In-flight Simulator Test Aircraft (VISTA), the jet is assigned to the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School (USAF TPS) at Edwards. The X-62A, with Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall aboard, takes off from Edwards for a demonstration flight in May 2024. USAF 'The potential radar upgrade is for the X-62 Variable In-Flight Simulator Test Aircraft (VISTA) in support of a Mission Systems Upgrade (MSU),' the contracting notice explains. 'The upgraded radar will be part of a set of modular components that can be used individually or together to provide sensory input to aircraft.' 'At the end of the mission systems upgrade, the aircraft will be capable of processing raw data from the AESA radar in an autonomy enclave that can use machine learning to process the data and directly control the sensors using either the existing modes available via the radar OFP [operational flight program] or via experimental modes and experimental combinations of modes inaccessible or unachievable by human use,' the notice adds. The notice also lays out a number of core requirements for an AESA to go onto the X-62A, including that it not weigh more than 200 pounds, be air-cooled, and have a startup time of under two minutes. It 'must be an AESA radar that can [be] operated in an unclassified mode' and 'be one that 'possess both an Air to Air and Air to Ground modes.' 'Raw AESA data must be available for computation external to AESA processing unit,' the contracting notice adds. The air-cooled requirement notably precludes the potential use of Northrop Grumman's AN/APG-83 AESA radar, also known as the Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR), which hundreds of operational Air Force F-16s are in the process of receiving. The SABR, which you can read more about here, is a liquid-cooled design. There are other AESAs on the market now could meet the stated requirements for installation on the X-62A. Raytheon's PhantomStrike, which is an air-cooled type that also weighs around 150 pounds, and is otherwise designed to be compact to help ease integration on a wide array of crewed and uncrewed aircraft, is one example. The ELM-2052 from ELTA, a subsidiary of Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), is another compact AESA that has been growing in popularity, including as an upgrade option for existing aircraft types, though it's not immediately clear if it meets the cooling and weight stipulations. A rendering depicting a PhantomStrike radar installed in the nose of a Kratos XQ-58 Valkyrie drone highlighting the compactness of the design. Raytheon It's unclear what radar the X-62A has now, but the two-seat Block 30 F-16D on which it is based would have come standard with a mechanically-scanned pulse-doppler AN/APG-68. In general, AESAs offer improved range, as well as greater precision and fidelity of tracks even when it comes to smaller or stealthy objects, compared to mechanically-scanned types. They are also more reliable and offer increased resistance to electronic warfare jamming. As such, a new AESA would give the X-62A valuable new capabilities, as well as better overall situational awareness. This, in turn, could be extremely useful for future autonomy testing work, including more advanced mock air-to-air engagements. After the ground-breaking dogfight earlier this year, the Air Force disclosed that the X-62A's systems had been directly exchanging position and other 'state information' with the crewed F-16 it was dueling with, primarily for safety reasons. As The War Zone has previously explored in detail, data-linking the X-62A to the crewed F-16 also made sense for practical reasons, but underscored significant challenges to overcome to truly demonstrate autonomous air-to-air combat capability against a completely unknown threat. The addition of a more modern radar is not enough by itself to address the issues at hand. As we wrote: 'Despite over a century of military aviation advancements, dogfighting remains a visual affair where a human pilot‚Äôs on-the-spot judgment, intuition, and stereo vision are critical. An aircraft‚Äôs sensor suite, including radar, electro-optical and infrared cameras, and electronic warfare and support measures systems, can provide a wealth of data about enemy contacts. However, their utility steadily diminishes, if it does not largely collapse, as the distance to the target closes to very close-in maneuvering range. A radar in the nose of an aircraft, for instance, can only ‚Äòsee‚Äô what‚Äôs in a cone-shaped area in front of it. Even existing 360-degree camera systems have two-dimensional limitations and can be hampered by environmental conditions. Datalinked information from external sources can be extremely valuable for building situational awareness or even guiding weapons, but it also has limited in fidelity. External tracks of the enemy and friendly fighters can merge together at very close range.' &#8230; 'The X-62A simply does not have any kind of organic sensor suite that would give it the uninterrupted 360-degree situational awareness that truly autonomous dogfighting would require. This is something that will have to be addressed when it comes to the development of future autonomous platforms. Arrays of small conformal radars, electro-optical or infrared cameras, and other sensors could be utilized to provide the necessary situational and spatial data, in effect working together to build telemetry for creating a solid digital three-dimensional ‚Äòpicture‚Äô of what is going on directly around the jet during a fast developing dogfight.' As the contracting notice about the new AESA for the X-62A notes, the radar is just one element of a planned suite of new sensors for the jet. If the Air Force uses a modular, open-architecture approach it could also help make it easier to add new and improved capabilities and functionality in the future. USAF The unique X-62A Variable-stability In-flight Simulator Test Aircraft (VISTA) seen here flew in a fully autonomous mode against a crewed F-16 fighter in a milestone mock dogfight in September 2023. USAF 'There is a plan and there is a development pathway in the future to incorporate sensing, and the complexity that that [sic] adds to the picture,' Air Force Col. James Valpiani, the commandant of the USAF TPS, told The War Zone and others at a media roundtable about the X-62A's dogfight back in April. 'Doing this in a safe and responsible way is to take it one step at a time to truly understand how each aspect works before moving on to the next problem.' Using pilot-optional surrogates like the X-62 presents additional benefits when it comes to accelerating testing and reducing risk and eliminates bottlenecks associated with domestic U.S. airspace restrictions currently placed on completely uncrewed platforms. The War Zone recently explored all of this in more detail in the context of the new stealthy Model 437 Vanguard technology demonstrator jet from Northrop Grumman subsidiary Scaled Composites. With this in mind, the Air Force has also been putting together a test force of six additional specially configured F-16s to further support advanced autonomy work as part of a project called VENOM (Viper Experimentation and Next-Gen Operations Mode). The VENOM jets are not being modified anywhere near to the same degree as the X-62A, but will also reportedly have AESA radars, as well as the warning sensors that go along with their electronic warfare suites. One of the first F-16s set to be converted into an autonomy testbed under Project VENOM arrives at Eglin Air Force Base on April 1, 2024. USAF 'The VENOM aircraft are the platforms that will have the ability to sense the environment around them and do some of the things that we presently have some limitations on VISTA with,' Air Force Lt. Col. Ryan Hefron, head of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Air Combat Evolution (ACE) program, also said at the April roundtable. 'Not to say ‚Ä¶ that we won‚Äôt continue to work on [ACE using] VISTA, because we absolutely will. There are certain things that the [X-62A] aircraft is capable of performing that won‚Äôt be, I‚Äôll say, well suited on the VENOM birds‚Ä¶ They each have their own unique place, I‚Äôll say, as testbeds.' ACE is the program under which the X-62A's artificial intelligence-driven dogfight was conducted and is among a number of efforts that are directly feeding into the Air Force's Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drone program. The service's plans for its CCAs are expected to evolve significantly as time goes on, but the main focus initially is on air-to-air combat in support of crewed platforms, as you can read more about in detail here. How much autonomy the first batches of CCAs might have and where humans will be in or on 'the loop' remain very open questions. 'We know two things about autonomy,' Andrew Hunter, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology & Logistics, more recently told The War Zone and other outlets at a media roundtable on the sidelines of the Air & Space Forces Association's main annual conference last week. 'One is laws of war require us to have, you know, human engagement in key decisions involving employment of weapons and other key decisions. So we have to have that. We have to have that human engagement, the ability to do that. The second is [that] we know that our ability to create systems that can operate autonomously and do missions well is something that is still maturing.' 'So, in other words, there are things that we know that we already know how to do well with autonomy, and there‚Äôs things that we know we do not know how to do well with autonomy,' Hunter continued. 'So we‚Äôre going to stick to the things we know we can do well, and then have humans do the other things, and, over time, that mix is going to change‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not going to be static.' The X-62A fitted with a new AESA radar and other sensors looks set to be an important part of how the Air Forces goes about defining its future autonomous air combat ecosystem.

Russian Destroyer Fired Warning Shots At Norwegian Fishing Boat: ...	A Russian Navy warship fired warning shots at a Norwegian fishing vessel in the Arctic Ocean earlier this month, according to an account from the boat‚Äôs skipper. The Russian Udaloy class destroyer, Admiral Levchenko, was taking part in large-scale maneuvers off the Norwegian coast, a region of increasingly strategic importance to both Moscow and NATO. The incident is said to have happened on September 12 when the 49-foot fishing boat MS Ragnhild Kristine was in the Norwegian exclusive economic zone (EEZ), north of Vard√∏, in the Barents Sea, off Norway‚Äôs northern coast.

As the boat‚Äôs captain explained to FriFagbevegelse, a Norwegian news website: 'I get called up on the radio. ‚ÄòThis is Russian warship; you need to leave the area.‚Äô I repeated that we should pull up our lines. Then the Russian warship comes at us at full speed‚Ä¶' The Russian captain explained that the warship was taking part in a live-fire exercise, but his Norwegian counterpart refused to move.

The ship is 200 meters [650 feet] from us ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs slightly threatening, you might say. They turn on the typhoon foghorn for about 15 seconds to get our attention. Then he fires a cannon somewhere in the sea. There‚Äôs a loud bang and the hull shakes violently.' The fishing vessel was not hit and it‚Äôs unclear if the Russian warship fired a live round or an inert one. The crew of the fishing boat assessed that some kind of projectile came down in the water near their vessel and exploded. The Admiral Levchenko is armed with two single 100mm AK-100 dual-purpose guns and four AK-630M 30mm Gatling-type guns for close-in defense. These are in addition to Rastrub anti-submarine missiles, Kinzhal short-range surface-to-air missiles, torpedoes, and RBU-6000 anti-submarine rocket launchers. The Russian Udaloy class anti-submarine warfare destroyer Admiral Levchenko. Neill Rush/Wikimedia Commons 'After the bang, we agreed to go west. It was ‚Äòvoluntary coercion,‚Äô as it was called when I was in the military,' the Norwegian captain explained. 'He led us all the way out of the field. The Norwegian Coast Guard also came down and talked to the Russians.' A spokesperson for the Norwegian Joint Headquarters said that a radio conversation took place between the vessels but said it was not able to confirm that a warning shot was fired. Regardless, Russian live-fire exercises in these waters are not unheard of and are announced in advance, however, Norwegian commercial vessels don‚Äôt necessarily have to leave the EEZ ‚Äî which is in international waters ‚Äî during military exercises. In the past, this has led to consternation from Norwegian fishermen, due to the potential risks as well as lost revenues. In this case, however, the crew of the Ragnhild Kristine says they didn‚Äôt receive the usual warning, which would be provided by the Norwegian authorities. The Admiral Levchenko was underway as part of the Okean 24 naval exercise. These drills date back to the Cold War era and the latest iteration was claimed to be the biggest of its kind in 30 years. According to Russian accounts, over 400 warships and 120 aircraft were used, and China also participated. While the Okean 24 exercises are nothing new, it‚Äôs reported that these maneuvers are being run closer to Norway and now involve a greater degree of live firing than they did in the past, especially since Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The announcement of the incident also comes just a month after it was revealed that one of Norway‚Äôs most strategic air bases was the target of sabotage, earlier this year. According to reports, a critical communications cable associated with Evenes Air Station, in northern Norway, was severed in April and is now being investigated. Suspected sabotage against Air Force Base in Northern Norway. It was an intentional and calculated action, the Norwegian Police says about the damage to the cable that belongs to the Evenes Air Station The Barents Observer (@BarentsNews) August 23, 2024 The incident at Evenes was announced amid increasing warnings about nefarious Russian activity in Europe, part of an apparent wave of ‚Äòhybrid warfare‚Äô as the conflict in Ukraine further stokes East-West tensions. With its strategic position in the far north of Europe, Norway, a NATO member, is very much on the front line of some of these tensions. The country has previously also had encounters with the Russian military. Back in 2018, the Norwegian Intelligence Service (NIS) disclosed three separate instances where Russian aircraft had flown mock attack profiles against a secretive radar station in the northern part of the country. The year before that, the NIS blamed Russian jamming for disruptions in cell phone and GPS service in the region, though it said this was a byproduct of an exercise and not a deliberate attack.

Michael Narten/Picture-Alliance/DPA via AP Norway‚Äôs geopolitical significance has been recognized by the U.S. military as it intensifies its focus on the strategically important Arctic region. This has included the deployment of U.S. Air Force bombers to Norway, which happened for the first time in 2021, as you can read about here. As part of its 2020 Arctic Strategy, the U.S. Air Force is looking to bolster its presence in the region to counter the threat posed by Russia. The wider region has been identified as a potential flashpoint, as climate change sees a scramble to secure the potential wealth offered by natural resources, as well as new maritime trade routes that are no longer constrained by year-round sea ice. A U.S. Air Force B-1B bomber accompanied by Royal Norwegian Air Force F-35A fighters during a Bomber Task Force deployment. Norwegian Armed Forces For Russia, the region is also home to its largest and most important naval force, the Northern Fleet, which includes the majority of the country‚Äôs nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines. Exercises like Okean 24 also practice defending Russian nuclear submarines, ensuring they can leave their ports and go on patrol as a critical part of the country‚Äôs strategic deterrent. This factor has been reflected in generally increased Russian submarine activity in the Barents Sea and the Arctic region, as well as the Atlantic, in recent years. In 2020, the U.S. Navy took the unusual step of releasing a number of pictures of its nuclear attack submarine USS Seawolf, which surfaced in a fjord near Troms√∏, Norway, for what was at the time a very rare public appearance in Scandinavia. USS Seawolf on the surface in a fjord near Troms√∏, Norway on August 21, 2020. U.S. Navy For its part, Russia established a new Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command in 2014, which is responsible for the Arctic, North Atlantic, and Scandinavian regions. It includes the Northern Fleet, assets of which are concentrated on the Kola Peninsula, as well as military garrisons, and airbases. Moscow has also been using increasingly bold rhetoric when it comes to the Arctic. Just last week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned that 'the Arctic is not the territory of the North Atlantic alliance' and that Moscow was 'fully ready to defend its interests' there.

Satellite Images Show Massive Devastation At Russian Ammo Storage...	New satellite imagery shared with The War Zone shows just how badly three ammunition storage sites in Russia were damaged in recent Ukrainian drone attacks. The strikes, against the Toropets and Oktyabrsk facilities west of Moscow and Tikhoretsk in southern Russia, resulted in tens of thousands of tons of ammunition - including North Korean missiles - being destroyed, Ukrainian and Estonian authorities said. Ukrainian officials acknowledged Tikhoretsk and Okyabrsk were attacked on Sept. 21 while Toropets was hit on Sept. 18. Tikhoretsk is located in the Krasnodar region, about 220 miles from the front lines. According to the U.S. Mission to the UN, the White House determined that it was one of the storage facilities for ballistic missiles provided by North Korea. You can see a video of that attack below.

'Prior to 2023, the Tikhoretsk Munitions Storage Facility, sometimes reported to be the 719th Artillery Munitions Base&#8230;has been primarily concerned with the storage and maintenance of artillery munitions, artillery systems, and related equipment. The facility is secured with a multiple-layer security fence with guard towers, encompasses approximately 2.6 km2, and is served by a rail spur line from the small rail facility at Tikhon‚Äôkii (Tikhon‚Äôkiy), 3 km to the north.' The images below, taken Sept. 14 and provided by Maxar Technologies, show what Tikhoretsk looked like before the drone attack. Russia's Tikhoretsk ammunition storage facility as seen on Sept. 14.

Scores of storage facilities appear to be destroyed or badly damaged and scorch marks cover a wide swath of the 2.6 square kilometer facility. The Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff said on its Facebook page that there were more than 2,000 tons of ammunition, including North Korean missiles, stored at Tikhoretsk. In addition, a Podlet radar station, which monitored aerial targets in the direction of the arsenal, was hit during the operation, according to the General Staff.

Located 300 miles north of the border, Oktyabrsk is home to the 23rd Artillery Arsenal. According to CNN, it is 'allegedly used to store Iskander tactical missile systems and Tochka-U tactical missile systems.'

After the attack, the crane and many of the train cars were destroyed. (Satellite image ¬©2024 Maxar Technologies) These attacks occured on some of Russia's largest ammunition storage facilities. How badly this will hurt its 'Special Military Operation' remains to be seen, but they show that Ukraine's long-range drone attacks continue to help offset Russia's advantages in the amount of troops and war materiel they have. The strikes on the ammunition storage area also came ahead of Ukrainian President Voldoymry Zelensky's visit to the U.S. this week, where he said he will present his Victory Plan to President Joe Biden as well as candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Among other things, the plan is said to include yet another appeal for the U.S. to end restrictions on the use of donated weapons deep into Russia. If that does not happen, Ukraine will have to continue to rely on its homegrown weapons to hit targets like those above. But while smaller drones rely on careful targeting to trigger a chain reaction of secondary explosions, the missiles the U.S. and its allies have provided can puncture even highly hardened storage areas, making totally devastating ammunition storage sites all that much easier.

All Three Chinese Aircraft Carriers Were At Sea For The First Tim...	In the latest expression of China‚Äôs rapidly growing and modernizing naval power, the People‚Äôs Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) recently, and for the first time, put three aircraft carriers to sea simultaneously. Of the three carriers involved in these activities, the Liaoning and the Shandong are by now well established with the Chinese fleet, while the Fujian, the country‚Äôs first domestically produced carrier, is still preparing for operational service. Ultimately, it‚Äôs expected to lead to more Chinese-made flattops as the PLAN continues to expand its naval aviation capabilities. Publicly available data, collated below by journalist Ian Ellis, indicates that, as of last week, the Liaoning and its carrier group were operating in the Philippine Sea, with the Shandong and its carrier group just off Hainan Island. Meanwhile, the Fujian had already left Jiangnan shipyard in Shanghai for another round of sea trials, with satellite imagery confirming that the three carriers were all sailing as of September 18. The carrier groups for the first two flattops each include at least four destroyers as well as a combat support vessel or frigate, very likely also accompanied by a hunter-killer submarine. A monumental milestone ‚Äî for the first time in its 97-year history, three PLA Navy aircraft carriers were underway at the same timeChina has deployed both operational carriers to the Western Pacific this summer (three times in three months)Here‚Äôs everything you need to know: pic.twitter.com/3gTKgnU2s5&mdash; Ian Ellis (@ianellisjones) September 23, 2024 Since returning from its 2nd WESTPAC deployment in August, Shandong has been in & out of port a few times.

As of today, the Fujian ‚Äî China‚Äôs first carrier to be fully locally designed and also the first intended to launch aircraft via catapults rather than by a ‚Äòski jump‚Äô takeoff ramp ‚Äî was apparently back in port in Shanghai, having completed its fourth at-sea trial. The PLANS-18 'Fujian' back on its pier after its fourth sea trial. (Image via @ÂåóÂÜ•ÊúâÈ±ºMK6 from Weibo) pic.twitter.com/VSzUXzY5wc&mdash; @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) September 23, 2024 Overall, and even accounting for the fact that the Fujian has yet to be commissioned, these deployments provide a powerful indication of the PLAN‚Äôs growing presence and capabilities, especially regarding its carrier force. It should also be noted that China‚Äôs two operational aircraft carriers have been at sea simultaneously before, but this is now becoming much more routine ‚Äî with three such dual-carrier deployments over three months this summer. Other aircraft carriers are also currently underway in the Indo-Pacific region, with the USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71) in the South China Sea as of late last week, having completed a deployment in the Middle East, as well as the Italian Navy aircraft carrier Cavour, a warship that you can read much more about here, and which recently conducted maneuvers with the U.S. and Australian armed forces. The Italian Navy aircraft carrier ITS Cavour during multinational task group activities in the Indo-Pacific region. Australian Department of Defense LSIS Daniel Goodman Beijing claims almost all of the highly strategic South China Sea, resulting in numerous disputes and standoffs. Recently, there have been multiple confrontations there involving China and the Philippines, including reports of Chinese Coast Guard vessels firing water cannons, blocking, and ramming Philippine vessels. Having the Liaoning and its carrier group here sends a powerful message to all the countries with stakes in this contested area. Last week, the Liaoning and accompanying ships were also noted sailing in waters off the east coast of Taiwan, that country‚Äôs defense ministry confirmed. The same carrier then passed through a narrow waterway between the Yonaguni and Iriomote islands in Japan‚Äôs Okinawa Prefecture, for the first time, according to the Japanese Ministry of Defense. :#BreakingNews‚ÄåChina's Navy aircraft carrier temporarily enters Japan's contiguous waters.'In the early hours on Wednesday, aircraft carrier Liaoning sailed between Yonaguni Island and Iriomote Island in Okinawa Prefecture,temporarily entering Japan's contiguous waters.' pic.twitter.com/TxBpkrRYvQ&mdash; OSINT Expert (@OsintExperts) September 19, 2024 The ability to deploy carriers east of Taiwan gives the PLA another option for persistently striking at the island from that vector while also occupying a blocking position against U.S. or other foreign military forces heading west. Chinese naval and air activity has increasingly focused on the less heavily defended eastern side of Taiwan in recent years. Since the summer and the election of a new Taiwanese president, the PLAN has been ramping up its activities around Taiwan, with yet another spike in Chinese naval activities around the island, which Beijing views as a breakaway province. Other Taiwan-related drills earlier this month have included an amphibious landing exercise on China‚Äôs southeast coast opposite the island, which was said to be the largest of its kind so far. Notably, Taiwan has recently warned that China‚Äôs intense military activity makes it much harder to assess whether or not the People‚Äôs Liberation Army is about to launch a military campaign ‚Äî for example, if it were about to attempt an invasion of Taiwan or encircle it, something that the Chinese military has repeatedly practiced, as you can read about here. Taiwanese soldiers stage an attack during an annual drill at a military base in the eastern city of Hualien. Photo by Mandy CHENG / AFP MANDY CHENG Taiwan‚Äôs Minister of Defense Wellington Koo last week pointed to China‚Äôs military activity getting 'larger and larger' with the effect that the island would have less time to respond were Beijing to actually go on the offensive, something that U.S. and other officials have suggested could happen around 2027. Koo said Taiwan needed to improve its ability to respond to 'a potential sudden contingency' and that the island‚Äôs reaction time 'cannot be as long as we would have imagined in the past.' 'We have to think about how we differentiate between peacetime and wartime,' Koo told reporters. 'The scale of [China‚Äôs military] activity is getting larger and larger, and so it is harder to discern when they might be shifting from training to a large exercise, and from an exercise to war.' Transitioning from a large-scale exercise to a military operation is hardly a new proposition, but there‚Äôs no doubt that China‚Äôs armed forces are expanding the scope and the complexity of their maneuvers, with the maritime component being very much at the forefront. The PLAN‚Äôs growing carrier force is becoming an increasingly important tool for a wide range of possible contingencies. In the Sea of Japan, meanwhile, where a PLAN surface action group is currently underway, recent incidents have included the reported violation of Japanese airspace by a Chinese surveillance aircraft, in what Tokyo said was a first-of-its-kind incident. The reported incursion took place late last month and you can read about it here. The PLAN has also recently been involved in large-scale military exercises with the Russian Navy.

The carrier activities further reinforce the already clear indications that the PLAN views its growing carrier force as a broader tool for projecting power further and further beyond China‚Äôs borders. This includes the critical First Island Chain, the boundary that is defined by archipelagos opposite mainland East Asia extending from the southern end of the Japanese home islands all the way to the South China Sea, and the Second Island Chain, which includes Guam and other U.S. island territories in the Marianas, extending further out into the Western Pacific. The PLAN‚Äôs carrier operations are now one of the most visible indicators of how the force is continuing to develop from a regional force that was primarily focused on operations in the First Island Chain to one that can also conduct operations out into the Second Island Chain and also more globally. As well as the carriers themselves, China is busy working on new and more capable aircraft from which to operate from them. These include the navalized version of the FC-31/J-35 stealth fighter, the KJ-600 airborne early warning and control plane, various drones, like the GJ-11 Sharp Sword unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV), plus helicopters. One of the first prototypes of the carrier-based J-35 stealth fighter. via Chinese internet The navalized J-35 ‚Äî this time not a mockup. Chinese internet Ultimately, these aircraft and others are expected to be assigned to even more advanced carrier designs, the next of which is generally referred to as the Type 004. There have been persistent reports that this vessel could be nuclear-powered, which would give it effectively unlimited range and help meet the power-generation demands of ever-improving sensors, other mission systems, and possibly directed-energy weapons. An artist's concept of a future Chinese aircraft carrier. Chinese internet via @HenriKenhmann Already, China has demonstrated it can have two operational carriers at sea simultaneously, but once the Fujian is commissioned, dual-carrier operations should become much more routine, with the option to have two flattops deployed and another in post-deployment maintenance or refit, for example. More realistically, during peacetime, it will provide for one at sea, one working up for a deployment, and another undergoing maintenance or refit. Reports from state-run Chinese media have suggested that the Fujian could be commissioned into service in 2025, but more sober analysis suggests this will likely not happen until 2026. While not strictly aircraft carriers, it‚Äôs worth recalling that China is also scheduled to receive a number of very large big-deck amphibious assault ships, referred to as the Type 076. Each will feature at least one electromagnetic catapult that is expected to be primarily used to launch drones, as you can read more about here. While the PLAN‚Äôs carrier force, even including the Fujian, is still clearly outmatched by the U.S. Navy‚Äôs fleet of 11 active nuclear-powered supercarriers, China is already benefiting from having multiple carriers to draw on, and this advantage is set to become more pronounced in the years to come.

Aggressor F-16 Fleet Set To Be Slashed By Air Force	The U.S. Air Force is set to significantly cut back the number of F-16 Viper aggressor jets at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, including those flown by a squadron that stood up in a high profile manner just last year. This comes despite a surge in demand for 'red air' adversary support training and test and evaluation activities and raises broader questions about the future of the service's steadily aging F-16 fleet. Lt. Gen. John Healy, who serves as both Chief of the Air Force Reserve within the Air Force's top headquarters at the Pentagon and head of Air Force Reserve Command at Robins Air Force Base in Georgia, provided an update on the aggressor force at Nellis on the sidelines of the Air & Space Forces Association's (AFA) main annual conference last week. Nellis is currently home to three dedicated aggressor units, the active duty 64th and 65th Aggressor Squadrons and the Air Force Reserve's 706th Aggressor Squadron. The 706th was formally activated last year, transitioning from its previous role as a non-flying unit managing reserve pilots assigned to the United States Air Force Warfare Center (USAFWC), as you can read more about here. The 64th and 706th also fly F-16 variants, while the 65th has F-35A Joint Strike Fighters. F-16Cs assigned to the 706th Aggressor Squadron support Exercise Bamboo Eagle 24-3 in August 2024. USAF 'So, our F-16 aggressors at Nellis&#8230; the program record currently has them divesting 26. So there's no change to that right now,' Lt. Gen. Healy told The War Zone and others at a media roundtable on September 17. 'So. as we're currently moving forward, the expectation is that we will divest the pre-Block F-16 aggressors, and we have new mission sets at Nellis that we will be able to do and should be able to utilize that manpower to build as we continue to go forward.' The tail of an F-16 aggressor belonging to the 64th Aggressor Squadron, but wearing the markings of the 926th Operations Group, the parent organization of what is now designated the 706th Aggressor Squadron, a ceremony marking the formal activation of the latter unit in 2023. USAF With regard to F-16s, 'pre-Block' refers to Block 30/32 and older C/D variants. For years now, the Air Force been pushing to divest all of its pre-Block F-16s in order to rationalize its Viper fleet around Block 40/42 C/Ds and newer Block 50/52 'post-Block' versions. 'We'll try to utilize them [the pre-Block F-16s from Nellis] for our other remaining pre-Block F-16 unit down in Homestead,' which will involve working 'to find out what's the best of the bunch to keep our most viable jets for [the] long term, Healy added last week. Homestead Air Reserve base in Florida is currently home to the 482nd Fighter Wing and its 93rd Fighter Squadron. It is unclear whether or not all of the 26 pre-Block F-16s that Lt. Gen. Healy said are now set to leave Nellis belong to the 706th Aggressor Squadron or if this includes ones assigned to the 64th Aggressor Squadron, as well. What this all might mean either way for the latter unit, including whether it might get additional newer jets to make up for the impending shortfall, is also not clear. The 64th has long operated a mix of Block 25 and 32 F-16s, but it has also received at least 11 post-Block versions in recent years, at least some of which are Block 40s. The Block 40s notably have different engines (General Electric F110-series) from the Block 25s and Block 32s (Pratt & Whitney F100-series), and different maintenance and logistics requirements, as a result. An F-16C assigned to the 64th Aggressor Squadron. USAF William Lewis There is already evidence that the aggressor changes at Nellis are set to impact more than just the reserve component. When the 706th started getting its first F-16s in September 2023, it was reported that the squadron was only set to get 18 Vipers in total. At least some of those jets appear to be Block 30s (also with General Electric F110-series engines) that came from the Air Force Reserve's 457th Fighter Squadron at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas, which has been in the process of converting to the F-35A in the past year or so. An F-16C wearing the 'TX' tail code of the 457th Fighter Squadron lands at Nellis Air Force Base in November 2023. Jamie Hunter The War Zone has reached out for more information about exactly what the Air Force's organic aggressor force at Nellis is expected to look like going forward and what broader implications this might have. As already noted, the plans to cut 26 F-16s from Nellis' aggressor community raises immediate questions about the Air Force's ability to provide organic red air support. Earlier this year, the active-duty 18th Aggressor Squadron at Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska also notably transitioned to a unique air defense unit, the 18th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, which you can read more about here. 'Alaska based forces will continue to support Air Force and Joint exercises in Alaska, including Red Flag-Alaska,' a spokesperson for the 354th Fighter Wing at Eielson told The War Zone in April when asked about how the change in the 18th's primary mission might lead to an aggressor capacity gap and what steps might be taken to mitigate that. An F-16C still wearing an aggressor-style camouflage scheme assigned to what is now the 18th Fighter Interceptor Squadron takes part in Red Flag-Alaska 24-3 in August 2024. USAF U.S. military demand for aerial aggressors has already grown in scope and scale in recent years. The Air Force is now pushing to further expand its slate of large force air combat exercises as part of an ongoing shift in focus to preparing for potential high-end conflicts, especially one in the Pacific against China. There has also been an explosion in demand for aggressor support for test and evaluation activity activities in recent years, particularly as the Air Force has been pushing ahead with its Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative and other modernization efforts. The Air Force, as well as the U.S. Navy, have and continue to make heavy use of contractor red air services to help bolster aggressor capacity. There has also been a clear desire in recent years to bolster the services' abilities to provide these capabilities organically, especially as privately-operated pre-fourth-generation aggressors become increasingly obsolete. There is a growing need for fourth and fifth-generation fighters to better replicate more advanced threats. With all this in mind, it is worth noting that in 2022, the Air Force abruptly decided not to renew a long-standing contract with private firm Draken to provide adversary air services at Nellis, specifically. The U.S. military has also been working to acquire of more capable semi-expendable and stealthy target drones to help expand capacity to replicate advanced crewed and uncrewed aerial threats during training and testing. For the Air Force, new advanced target drones are seen as critical given the dwindling supply of older F-16s to convert into QF-16 drones. More capable uncrewed aggressors, possibly derived from future Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) designs, could be part of the aggressor equation in the future, too. However, current domestic U.S. airspace restrictions mean that uncrewed platforms of any type are not really usable in large force exercises that extend beyond the boundaries of tightly controlled ranges. Speaking at the roundtable at the AFA conference last week, Lt. Gen. Healy alluded to larger aggressor capacity concerns. 'We put them there [the pre-Block F-16s for the 706th] with the hopes of expanding and continuing further,' Healy said. 'That hasn't come to pass.' As the Air Force's fighter, F-16s continue to be in high demand to support training and test and evaluation requirements, as well as for operational deployments. As of Fiscal Year 2023, the service had 841 F-16s of all types, with the number expected to drop to 830 by the close of this fiscal cycle, which ends next Monday. Around 608 of the remaining jets are set to receive a slate of significant upgrades, including new active electronically-scanned array (AESA) radars and improved electronic warfare suites, as you can learn more about here. Even so, questions have been emerging already about the sustainability of Air Force F-16s, even post-Block types that are also getting ever older. These challenges have only become more pronounced as the Air Force has steadily walked back its expectation that the F-35, a program staring down ballooning sustainment costs and other issues, will completely supplant the Viper any time soon. In March, the Air Force also warned that hundreds of aircraft, including Vipers and other types, could end up grounded without an additional $1.5 billion for spare parts on top of its formal budget request for the 2025 Fiscal Year. The possibility of the Air Force buying new production Block 70/72 F-16C/Ds to bolster its tactical aviation fleets in the near term has come in the past. A Block 70 F-16C for the Royal Bahrani Air Force undergoing flight testing. USAF 'I am not tracking [that]. I don't have any information for you [on] that. There could be and I just don't know, or [there] may not be,' Maj. Gen. Bryony Terrell, Special Assistant to the Director of the Air National Guard, said in response to a question from The War Zone at a separate roundtable on the sidelines of the AFA conference last week about whether there were any plans to even look into buying new-build Block 70/72 Vipers. The Air Force has also expressed interest in utilizing the T-7A Red Hawk trainers that it is in the process of acquiring in the aggressor role. The idea of a light fighter based on the T-7 has also been put forward. Unfortunately, the T-7 continues to be beset by delays, with the first of these jet trainers now not expected to enter service until 2028. The first pre-production T-7A arrives at Edwards Air Force Base in 2023. USAF The first pre-production T-7A lands at Edwards Air Force Base. USAF Uncertainty around the Air Force's plans to acquire a new crewed sixth-generation stealth combat jet, primarily as a replacement for the much more advanced by also aging F-22 Raptor fleet, has prompted renewed discussions about purchasing an alternative 'light' stealth fighter of some kind, as well. The service is now regularly warning about at best flat budgets in the coming years that could upend modernization efforts across the board. In the meantime, increasingly complex global threats from great power competitors China and, to a lesser degree, Russia only look set to grow. This has driven demand for higher-end aggressor support and, in turn, contributed to the major push for more organic red air adversary capacity, especially after the end of the Draken contract at Nellis. Now, despite the continued demand, the Air Force's aggressor forces look to be contracting again without a clear plan to make up for the resulting gap. No matter how the Air Force's force structure ultimately evolves, the existing Viper fleet, even with substantial upgrades, will never be able to last forever, either. The plans to significantly shrink the number of dedicated aggressor F-16s at Nellis, together with other questions about the future of the Air Force's aging F-16 fleet, could be signs now of trouble on the horizon for the Air Force's aging F-16 fleet as a whole.

Hezbollah Converted Soviet Tu-143 Jet Recon Drone Into Cruise Mis...	Hezbollah now appears to be using converted Soviet-era jet-powered reconnaissance drones as cruise missiles. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) on Monday released a video it claimed showed an airstrike several weeks ago on a home in south Lebanon containing what it calls a 'DR-3 cruise missile' about to be launched. The DR-3 is another name for the Soviet-era Russian-made Tu-143 Reys jet-powered reconnaissance drone. Ukraine pioneered the conversion of Tu-143s into long-range strike weapons fairly quickly after Russia's all-out invasion. While Hezbollah has a massive cache of missiles and rockets, this marks the first emergence of a converted Tu-143 into a quasi-land attack cruise missile in its arsenal. You can read more about Hezbollah‚Äôs weapons cache in our deep dive here. The IDF used a photo of a Tu-143 Reys jet-powered drone to illustrate what it says was a Hezbollah cruise missile it destroyed before launch. (IDF) The IDF also used a Tu-143 in its illustration of how it claims Hezbollah uses civilian structures to launch weapons. (IDF screencap) You can see a retired Ukrainian Tu-143 in the image below. A retired Ukrainian Tu-143 Reys displayed in Kyiv. The drone is 26 feet 5 inches long with a wingspan of 7 feet 4 inches. (VargaA/Wikimedia Commons) What's also of great interest is the video of the strike shows how the missile was hidden inside a home. The Tu-143 is runway independent and uses rocket assistance for launching from a rail on a trailer or launch vehicle. For recovery, it uses a parachute system, although that would not be necessary for a cruise missile conversion. Tu-143 launching from its mobile container launcher. (uncredited) 'Here we are exposing Hezbollah‚Äôs method of hiding a cruise missile inside a home,' IDF spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari explained. 'The terrorists create a designated opening for the missile launch. Here you can see how we identified the terrorists making an opening in the building that exposed the missile. In a precise strike, the IDF eliminated the terrorists and this missile launching infrastructure, shortly before the launch.' Israel used a weapon with man-in-the-loop control to strike the Tu-143, of which it has many varieties, from shorter-ranged Spike missiles to Spice guided bombs to Delilah cruise missiles. In this case it looks like the observation platform was the same as the weapon used in the attack, which would point to Harop loitering munition or similar. IDF Spokesman Rear Adm.

Daniel Hagari exposing Hezbollah‚Äôs way of firing missiles from civilian homes, and how the IDF plans on dismantling it: pic.twitter.com/smkfjv6VDh&mdash; Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) September 23, 2024 Hezbollah, for its part, claims it has an extensive network of underground facilities it can use to fire weapons, including multiple launch rocket systems. You can read more about that here. The following video was used by Hezbollah to back up that claim, though it remains unclear where or when it was taken. Imad 4: Hezbollah reveals its underground capabilities.Huge tunnels inside mountaintops, dozens of rocket launchers. pic.twitter.com/NKP0Ydl57E&mdash; Clash Report (@clashreport) August 16, 2024 The IDF did not say how many of these improvised cruise missiles may exist, whether they have already been used or from where they were procured. Russia had previously provided some to the Assad regime in Syria, which is also backed by Hezbollah benefactor Iran. Moreover, Tehran has supplied Moscow with ballistic missiles and drones as part of a burgeoning military relationship between the two nations. The Tu-143 would give Hezbollah an additional capability to hit targets as far south as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. The IDF said it has a range of 124 miles, which corresponds with our previous reporting, and can deliver a 600-pound warhead. That means it can reach further and hit harder than much of Hezbollah‚Äôs cache of at least 150,000 rockets. However, as we previously noted, there are some limitations to this conversion, not least of which is relatively poor accuracy, unless more significant upgrades have been made to their guidance systems. As we have reported several times, Ukraine has converted the drone into a strike weapon and has used them to attack targets inside Russia and Crimea. The Tu-143 was first seen in its converted form in June 2022, when one, believed to be Ukrainian, was shot down in western Russia, according to a local official. You can see images purporting to be Tu-143 wreckage in Russia in the following Tweet, which misidentified it as the similar Tu-141 Strizh. The governor of the Kursk Oblast has shared photos of what he claims is a downed Ukrainian Tu-141 Strizh. pic.twitter.com/EoNwXnUw58&mdash; Benjamin Pittet (@COUPSURE) June 29, 2022 Ukraine pioneered these conversions with another very similar converted jet-powered Soviet-era reconnaissance drone, the larger Tu-141 to attack Russian airfields. The Tu-141 has a reported range of more than 650 miles. That Ukraine was converting these drones into strike weapons was first discovered when a Tu-141 crashed in Croatia in March in 2022. It was a bizarre and still-unexplained incident that we reported on here. The Tu-141 in Croatia reportedly carried an explosive warhead. The strike on the DF-3 was part of an increasing campaign to degrade Hezbollah‚Äôs capabilities, the IDF said on Telegram Monday. 'Shortly, the IDF will engage in extensive, precise strikes, against terror targets which have been embedded widely throughout Lebanon,' Hagari said. 'We advise civilians from Lebanese villages located in and next to buildings and areas used by Hezbollah for military purposes, such as those used to store weapons, to immediately move out of harm's way for their own safety.' Lebanese officials claim more than 350 were killed and more than 1,240 were wounded in these attacks.

Smoke rises after an Israeli airstrike hit the Tyre, in southern Lebanon on September 19, 2024. (Photo by Stringer/Anadolu via Getty Images) Anadolu There is growing concern that what began as a surprise Hamas attack on Israel Oc. 7, 2023 could spin into a larger, regional conflict. Hezbollah began its latest campaign of missile, rocket, and drone attacks on Israel the following day and the two sides have been trading volleys on an almost daily basis since. Adding to recent tensions, last week Israel apparently orchestrated two days of coordinated explosions targeting thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah in Lebanon. You can read our reporting of the first wave of explosions here, and the second wave here. Hezbollah leaders have vowed revenge. Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah‚Äôs leader, threatened Israel with 'tough retribution and just punishment' and that this would happen 'where it expects it and where it does not.' A photo taken on September 18, 2024, in Beirut's southern suburbs, shows the remains of exploded pagers on display at an undisclosed location. Hundreds of pagers used by Hezbollah members exploded across Lebanon on Sept. 17, killing at least nine people and wounding around 2,800 in blasts the Iran-backed militant group blamed on Israel. (Photo by AFP) - As a result of the increasing violence, The U.S. is sending more troops to the region in response, the Pentagon said Monday. The Pentagon's top spokesman, Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, provided no details on how many additional forces or what they would be tasked to do, The Associated Press reported. The U.S. currently has about 40,000 troops in the region, according to the wire service. 'In light of increased tension in the Middle East and out of an abundance of caution, we are sending a small number of additional U.S. military personnel forward to augment our forces that are already in the region,' Ryder said. 'But for operational security reasons, I‚Äôm not going to comment on or provide specifics.' 'On Monday, the aircraft carrier USS Truman, two destroyers, and a cruiser set sail from Norfolk, Virginia, headed to the Mediterranean on a regularly scheduled deployment, opening the possibility that the U.S. could keep both the Truman and the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, which is in the Gulf of Oman, nearby in case further violence breaks out,' the AP explained. The extent of Hezbollah's converted jet drone arsenal remains unknown as does whether it has used these weapons. Unlike in Ukraine, no wreckage has yet been found. If anything else, this is another sign that some of the improvised long-range strike practices from Ukraine and proliferating elsewhere. If these Tu-143s came from Syria, for instance, it would make sense for Hezbollah to want to attempt to adapt them just as Ukraine did.

AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon To Equip Ukraine‚Äôs F-16s: Report	Ukraine will likely receive a number of AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) glide munitions in a new $375 million U.S. aid package next week, Politico reported. The unpowered air-to-ground weapon has a range of over 70 miles, depending on flight profile, so it can be launched from outside the range of most enemy‚Äôs air defense systems. JSOWs do not have the reach of air-launched cruise missiles like the U.K.-French Storm Shadow/Scalp-EG it has received, or the German Taurus KEPD 350 cruise missiles it has long coveted. They also aren't as capable, long-ranged, hard-hitting, or stealth as the AGM-158 JASSM cruise missiles Ukraine wants most for its F-16s. However, it still gives Ukraine a weapon that can fire from safer distances at Russian troop concentrations, air defenses, and other targets, and navigate around air defenses to get there. . A US Navy ordnance handler pushes a Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) across the flight deck of the USS Kitty Hawk. (Photo by LEILA GORCHEV / AFP) LEILA GORCHEV In a previous analysis of potential Ukrainian F-16 weapons, we described JSOW as the most likely new advanced weapon Ukraine would receive with its donated F-16 Vipers. You can read our complete report on what could be available for Ukraine's here. The analysis continued: '[JSOW] is very well suited for the unique combat environment in Ukraine. It can autonomously glide to its target from over 70 miles away when launched at altitude or over a dozen miles when launched at low altitude. It could be especially useful for target geolocated static/semi-static air defense systems and its imaging infrared sensor it uses for terminal homing is impervious to radio-frequency jamming. It has a very small signature, as well, making it that much harder for Russian air defenses to shoot down.' JSOW had been delivered in cluster and unitary warhead configurations, with the latter being the focus of production today. Zelensky is scheduled to visit Washington next week, where he will present his peace plan as well as appeal to the Biden administration to remove restrictions on the use of long-range weapons deep inside Russia. This package, also likely to include artillery ammunition, rockets and air defense missiles, will be the largest package the U.S. has sent Ukraine since May, Politico noted. It could be the last presidential drawdown of equipment before the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. Under authority granted by Congress, the U.S. pulls existing weapons from its stockpiles, and the money is meant to purchase replacement munitions and equipment. The Pentagon is working with Congress to roll the remaining $5.9 billion left in the presidential drawdown authority (PDA) over to the next fiscal year, spokesman Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said last week in a statement. No deal has been struck yet as lawmakers struggle to come up with a plan to avoid a government shutdown on Oct.1, which will occur if no stopgap funding measure is passed in time. NEW: In a first, US will likely send Ukraine the Joint Standoff Weapon for its F16s. It's a precision missile that can travel around 70 miles. It's part of a $375M aid package expected to be announced Monday. Paul McLeary (@paulmcleary) September 20, 2024 The Latest Russia lost up to three months' worth of ammunition during the massive Sept. 18 Ukrainian drone attack on a sprawling storage facility in the country‚Äôs west, an Estonian intelligence officer told reporters on Friday. Ukraine managed to hit the warehouse when part of the ammunition was not completely placed in the bunkers, and that set off a chain of explosions, Ants Kiviselg said, according to the Estonian ERR news outlet. You can see the first moments of the attack in a video posted on Twitter. Short video of the first moments of the attack on a Russian Toropets ammunition storage and the panic of local residents. pic.twitter.com/UBN13AL6kV&mdash; Special Kherson Cat (@bayraktar_1love) September 20, 2024 About '30,000 tons of ammunition exploded, that is, 750,000 shells,' he claimed. 'At the average rate of hostilities, Russia produces 10,000 shells per week. That‚Äôs a two- to three-month supply of ammunition.' 'We will see the consequences of this loss at the front in the coming weeks,' he added. The War Zone cannot independently verify Kiviselg's assessment. Toropets suffered widespread damage in the attack, though one analyst suggested the loss of ammunition was likely far less than the numbers posited by Kiviselg. I have counted more than 90 destroyed buildings at the base. In 2018, Russian state media reported that each 'storage facility' can hold 240 tons of ammunition. If every building was full that would be a loss of approx. 21,600 tons. The real number is likely significantly lower.&mdash; Kyle Glen (@KyleJGlen) September 20, 2024 Data collected by NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) showed that the facility was still smoldering days after the attack.

In addition, other accounts suggested that that guided bombs, artillery, and S-400 air defense missiles were also stored there. The head of Ukraine‚Äôs Center for Countering Disinformation, Andriy Kovalenko, said on Telegram that the facility in Toropets was also being used to store ballistic missiles supplied to Russia by North Korea. The facility was still spewing smoke a day after being attacked, according to this Maxar Technologies satellite image taken Wednesday. A huge explosion rocked the Tver region, in the west of Russia, with initial reports indicating that Ukrainian long-range attack drones targeted an ammunition depot there. Videos and pictures on social media from the scene show an initial explosion, with a very large fireball, followed by a significant visible shockwave, then several minutes‚Äô worth of secondary explosions illuminating the night sky.(Satellite image ¬©2024 Maxar Technologies) Russia depends heavily on artillery barrages on the front lines and deep-strike missile attacks on Ukrainian cities to prosecute this war. While the Estonian claim of 750,000 artillery shells is certainly a huge number, Russia has received millions of rounds from North Korea. Pyongyang has also supplied Moscow with ballistic missiles, as has Iran, which has also delivered thousands of Shahed drones. Still, in a war where its troops are consistently overmatched in terms of artillery, facing three-quarters of a million fewer shells would be good news for Ukraine. On the battlefield, Ukrainian forces continued to push westward in its Kursk salient but neither side made confirmed advances, according to the latest assessment from the Institute for The Study of War (ISW). There is visual evidence that Ukraine tried to advance toward the town of Veseloe. That's located about five miles southwest of Glushkovo, a tactically important city on the Seim River. The idea is to try and create a pincer, catching thousands of Russian troops between Glushkovo and Tetkino, about 13 miles to the west. However, as the last video below shows, the Ukrainian advance came under heavy fire with several vehicles likely destroyed. Meanwhile, Russia pounded Ukrainian positions in Kursk with glide bombs.

'The Ukrainian Defense Forces have now managed to reduce the assault capabilities of the occupiers in the Donetsk region,' he said in his evening address on Thursday. 'The situation remains extremely challenging, with heavy fighting daily in the Kurakhove and Pokrovsk directions. But we are doing everything possible for the resilience of our combat brigades. A separate issue was the operation in the Kursk region. We have already managed to divert around 40,000 Russian troops to this area. Our active operations continue. The 'exchange fund' is also being replenished for us, for Ukraine. All these are important factors influencing the overall situation in the war. I thank all our combat brigades, every soldier, sergeant, every commander, for their bravery.' The shortage of troops is not something just affecting Ukraine. The issue has become so dire for Russia that its Defense Ministry officials have unsuccessfully pressed President Vladimir Putin for more troops, The Wall Street Journal reported. 'Months before President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs inauguration in May, he met with Defense Ministry officials who pushed for a fresh round of mobilization to recruit more troops to offset Russia‚Äôs losses on the front line in Ukraine,' the publication reported, citing a person briefed on the exchange. 'Putin dismissed the idea, saying he wanted to use only those who were voluntarily signing military contracts,' the person said. 'Forces are currently not sufficient to achieve the original war aims, knock Ukraine out of the war, to undermine its military potential or protect border regions of the Russian territory. More and more people are saying mobilization is inevitable.'

Before his F-16 went down, Mes, who went by the call sign 'Moonfish,' shot down three Russian cruise missiles and a one-way attack drone, Ukrainian Air Force Command West said on Facebook at the time. 'One scenario floating among the Ukrainian defense community is that the F-16 flew inadvertently through a cloud of debris created by the successful intercept and destruction of one of the incoming Russian missiles,' Breaking Defense reported. 'These fragments of the destroyed missile may have caused damage to the engine and other parts of the aircraft, causing the F-16 to break apart and/or the death of the pilot before he could eject.' This version 'is emerging as one of the more plausible scenarios, due to past precedence,' the publication noted, citing Ukrainian defense industry executives. One of them told the outlet that 'earlier in the war we lost four other fighters to this same cause of airborne foreign objects disabling the aircraft.' A Ukrainian F-16 piloted by pilot Oleksii Mes allegedly crashed due to the impact of a downed Russian missile.

The -5F variant is optimized for air-to-air use, but the plan now appears to be using them as ground-attack jets, employing air-to-ground munitions that France has already been sending to Ukraine, such as the stealthy SCALP-EG cruise missile and the Hammer rocket-assisted precision-guided bomb.

AGM-154 Joint Stand-Off Weapon To Equip Ukraine‚Äôs F-16s: Report	Ukraine will likely receive a number of AGM-154 Joint Stand-Off Weapon (JSOW) glide munitions in a new $375 million U.S. aid package next week, Politico reported. The unpowered air-to-ground weapon has a range of over 70 miles, depending on flight profile, so it can be launched from outside the range of most enemy‚Äôs air defense systems. JSOWs do not have the reach of air-launched cruise missiles like the U.K.-French Storm Shadow/Scalp-EG it has received, or the German Taurus KEPD 350 cruise missiles it has long coveted. They also aren't as capable, long-ranged, hard-hitting, or stealth as the AGM-158 JASSM cruise missiles Ukraine wants most for its F-16s. However, it still gives Ukraine a weapon that can fire from safer distances at Russian troop concentrations, air defenses, and other targets, and navigate around air defenses to get there. .

(Photo by LEILA GORCHEV / AFP) LEILA GORCHEV In a previous analysis of potential Ukrainian F-16 weapons, we described JSOW as the most likely new advanced weapon Ukraine would receive with its donated F-16 Vipers. You can read our complete report on what could be available for Ukraine's here. The analysis continued: '[JSOW] is very well suited for the unique combat environment in Ukraine. It can autonomously glide to its target from over 70 miles away when launched at altitude or over a dozen miles when launched at low altitude. It could be especially useful for target geolocated static/semi-static air defense systems and its imaging infrared sensor it uses for terminal homing is impervious to radio-frequency jamming. It has a very small signature, as well, making it that much harder for Russian air defenses to shoot down.' JSOW had been delivered in cluster and unitary warhead configurations, with the latter being the focus of production today. Zelensky is scheduled to visit Washington next week, where he will present his peace plan as well as appeal to the Biden administration to remove restrictions on the use of long-range weapons deep inside Russia. This package, also likely to include artillery ammunition, rockets and air defense missiles, will be the largest package the U.S. has sent Ukraine since May, Politico noted. It could be the last presidential drawdown of equipment before the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. Under authority granted by Congress, the U.S. pulls existing weapons from its stockpiles, and the money is meant to purchase replacement munitions and equipment. The Pentagon is working with Congress to roll the remaining $5.9 billion left in the presidential drawdown authority (PDA) over to the next fiscal year, spokesman Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said last week in a statement. No deal has been struck yet as lawmakers struggle to come up with a plan to avoid a government shutdown on Oct.1, which will occur if no stopgap funding measure is passed in time. NEW: In a first, US will likely send Ukraine the Joint Standoff Weapon for its F16s. It's a precision missile that can travel around 70 miles. It's part of a $375M aid package expected to be announced Monday. Paul McLeary (@paulmcleary) September 20, 2024 The Latest Russia lost up to three months' worth of ammunition during the massive Sept. 18 Ukrainian drone attack on a sprawling storage facility in the country‚Äôs west, an Estonian intelligence officer told reporters on Friday. Ukraine managed to hit the warehouse when part of the ammunition was not completely placed in the bunkers, and that set off a chain of explosions, Ants Kiviselg said, according to the Estonian ERR news outlet. You can see the first moments of the attack in a video posted on Twitter. Short video of the first moments of the attack on a Russian Toropets ammunition storage and the panic of local residents. pic.twitter.com/UBN13AL6kV&mdash; Special Kherson Cat (@bayraktar_1love) September 20, 2024 About '30,000 tons of ammunition exploded, that is, 750,000 shells,' he claimed. 'At the average rate of hostilities, Russia produces 10,000 shells per week. That‚Äôs a two- to three-month supply of ammunition.' 'We will see the consequences of this loss at the front in the coming weeks,' he added. The War Zone cannot independently verify Kiviselg's assessment. Toropets suffered widespread damage in the attack, though one analyst suggested the loss of ammunition was likely far less than the numbers posited by Kiviselg. I have counted more than 90 destroyed buildings at the base. In 2018, Russian state media reported that each 'storage facility' can hold 240 tons of ammunition. If every building was full that would be a loss of approx. 21,600 tons. The real number is likely significantly lower.&mdash; Kyle Glen (@KyleJGlen) September 20, 2024 Data collected by NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) showed that the facility was still smoldering days after the attack. A sprawling Russian ammunition storage facility is still burning days after a massive Ukrainian drone attack.

Much of the town, which has around 13,000 residents, was damaged in the strike. Toropets, the aftermath. pic.twitter.com/VRUJWWtfWC&mdash; WarTranslated (Dmitri) (@wartranslated) September 19, 2024 As we previously noted, the facility reportedly housed numerous warehouses for ballistic missiles, Grad rockets, artillery shells, and other explosives, as well as fuel tanks. In addition, other accounts suggested that that guided bombs, artillery, and S-400 air defense missiles were also stored there. The head of Ukraine‚Äôs Center for Countering Disinformation, Andriy Kovalenko, said on Telegram that the facility in Toropets was also being used to store ballistic missiles supplied to Russia by North Korea. The facility was still spewing smoke a day after being attacked, according to this Maxar Technologies satellite image taken Wednesday. A huge explosion rocked the Tver region, in the west of Russia, with initial reports indicating that Ukrainian long-range attack drones targeted an ammunition depot there. Videos and pictures on social media from the scene show an initial explosion, with a very large fireball, followed by a significant visible shockwave, then several minutes‚Äô worth of secondary explosions illuminating the night sky.(Satellite image ¬©2024 Maxar Technologies) Russia depends heavily on artillery barrages on the front lines and deep-strike missile attacks on Ukrainian cities to prosecute this war. While the Estonian claim of 750,000 artillery shells is certainly a huge number, Russia has received millions of rounds from North Korea. Pyongyang has also supplied Moscow with ballistic missiles, as has Iran, which has also delivered thousands of Shahed drones. Still, in a war where its troops are consistently overmatched in terms of artillery, facing three-quarters of a million fewer shells would be good news for Ukraine. On the battlefield, Ukrainian forces continued to push westward in its Kursk salient but neither side made confirmed advances, according to the latest assessment from the Institute for The Study of War (ISW). There is visual evidence that Ukraine tried to advance toward the town of Veseloe. That's located about five miles southwest of Glushkovo, a tactically important city on the Seim River. The idea is to try and create a pincer, catching thousands of Russian troops between Glushkovo and Tetkino, about 13 miles to the west. However, as the last video below shows, the Ukrainian advance came under heavy fire with several vehicles likely destroyed. Meanwhile, Russia pounded Ukrainian positions in Kursk with glide bombs.

'With many different units ‚Äî all in various states of combat effectiveness ‚Äî deployed to the Pokrovsk front, effective communication between brigades is a crucial factor that is often lacking,' soldiers from two brigades told the publication. 'One officer of the 68th, who asked not to be identified because of the nature of his comments, said that for months over summer, one of the neighboring brigades would consistently fail to report lost positions, leaving his own units vulnerable from the flank without knowing about it,' the Kyiv Independent reported. 'In our area, there are a lot of different units, and communication between them becomes a big problem,' said one of those soldiers.

'The Ukrainian Defense Forces have now managed to reduce the assault capabilities of the occupiers in the Donetsk region,' he said in his evening address on Thursday. 'The situation remains extremely challenging, with heavy fighting daily in the Kurakhove and Pokrovsk directions. But we are doing everything possible for the resilience of our combat brigades. A separate issue was the operation in the Kursk region. We have already managed to divert around 40,000 Russian troops to this area. Our active operations continue. The 'exchange fund' is also being replenished for us, for Ukraine. All these are important factors influencing the overall situation in the war. I thank all our combat brigades, every soldier, sergeant, every commander, for their bravery.' The shortage of troops is not something just affecting Ukraine. The issue has become so dire for Russia that its Defense Ministry officials have unsuccessfully pressed President Vladimir Putin for more troops, The Wall Street Journal reported. 'Months before President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs inauguration in May, he met with Defense Ministry officials who pushed for a fresh round of mobilization to recruit more troops to offset Russia‚Äôs losses on the front line in Ukraine,' the publication reported, citing a person briefed on the exchange. 'Putin dismissed the idea, saying he wanted to use only those who were voluntarily signing military contracts,' the person said. 'Forces are currently not sufficient to achieve the original war aims, knock Ukraine out of the war, to undermine its military potential or protect border regions of the Russian territory. More and more people are saying mobilization is inevitable.'

Before his F-16 went down, Mes, who went by the call sign 'Moonfish,' shot down three Russian cruise missiles and a one-way attack drone, Ukrainian Air Force Command West said on Facebook at the time. 'One scenario floating among the Ukrainian defense community is that the F-16 flew inadvertently through a cloud of debris created by the successful intercept and destruction of one of the incoming Russian missiles,' Breaking Defense reported. 'These fragments of the destroyed missile may have caused damage to the engine and other parts of the aircraft, causing the F-16 to break apart and/or the death of the pilot before he could eject.' This version 'is emerging as one of the more plausible scenarios, due to past precedence,' the publication noted, citing Ukrainian defense industry executives. One of them told the outlet that 'earlier in the war we lost four other fighters to this same cause of airborne foreign objects disabling the aircraft.' A Ukrainian F-16 piloted by pilot Oleksii Mes allegedly crashed due to the impact of a downed Russian missile. Other Ukrainian aircraft could also have been disabled for the same reason, Breaking Defense reports, citing sources in Ukraine.&mdash; Hromadske Int.

The aircraft could be delivered with valuable new munitions, including versions of the MICA beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile. The -5F variant is optimized for air-to-air use, but the plan now appears to be using them as ground-attack jets, employing air-to-ground munitions that France has already been sending to Ukraine, such as the stealthy SCALP-EG cruise missile and the Hammer rocket-assisted precision-guided bomb.

'During a meeting on Thursday, the Security Service of Ukraine and the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said Telegram is actively used by Russia for cyberattacks, phishing, spreading malware, establishing user locations and calibrating missile strikes,' The Associated Press reported. 'An exception to the ban will be allowed for people who use the app in their official duties. Ukrainians are free to use the app in their personal devices.' The app is widely used in Ukraine and Russia not only for texting but also for reading news, including updates on Russian air attacks.

What American Fighters And Their Drone Wingmen Fighting Chinese J...	Collins Aerospace has put forward a vision for what a high-end air combat engagement between the U.S. and Chinese armed forces, with the American side employing crewed fighters and Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drone wingmen, could look like in the future. A division of Raytheon (now formally known as RTX), Collins released the glitzy computer-generated video seen below last week primarily to showcase its work on autonomous capabilities that could support the U.S. Air Force's CCA program, as well as the U.S. Navy's separate, but closely related effort of the same name. The video opens with U.S. forces forming for the mission at hand. CCAs are showing taking off from a remote airstrip and an aircraft carrier. This highlights the potential for the drones to be launched from disparate operating locations and not necessarily ones tied to the basing of their crewed companions. The War Zone has noted in the past how drones with limited dependence on traditional runways, or even complete runaway independence, could be extremely valuable in future distributed operations. A notional CCA takes off from a remote airstrip. Collins Aerospace capture Two different kinds of notional CCAs are depicted. One that has some very general similarities to Anduril's Fury. The other looks very much in line with Kratos' XQ-58 Valkyrie. A CCA design that General Atomics is currently working on also has a broadly similar overall configuration with a top-mounted intake and v-tail. A screen capture showing the two types of notional CCAs in the Collins Aerospace video. Collins Aerospace capture Fury and General Atomics' CCA design are currently under development as part of the first phase of the Air Force's CCA program. The Air Force, as well as the U.S. Marine Corps, have also been flying XQ-58s to support work on autonomous capabilities, as well as other research and development and test and evaluation efforts.

USAF Collins' video shows two-seat F-15E Strike Eagle derivatives, F/A-18F Super Hornets, and F-35 Joint Strike Fighters as the crewed controllers for the CCAs. Both the F-15s and F/A-18Fs are notably shown carrying podded infrared search and track (IRST) systems, as well as full air-to-air combat load-outs including AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) and AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles. US Navy F/A-18F Super Hornets carrying IRST pods, AIM-120s, and AIM-9Xs, flying together with CCAs. Collins Aerospace capture The F-15s depicted in the video are some of a hybrid of real-world variants. The jets are shown with additional outboard underwing pylons currently only found in U.S. Air Force service on the F-15EX Eagle II, but lack other key features on that version. The aircraft also have 'MO' tail codes indicating jets based at Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho, where F-15E Strike Eagles are based. There are no current plans to replace the F-15Es in Idaho with EXs. Collins Aerospace capture The War Zone has repeatedly highlighted how two-seat tactical jets like the F-15EX would be particularly well suited to serving as airborne drone controllers since the individual in the back seat could handle that mission while the pilot focuses on actual flying. Back-seaters in F-15s and F/A-18Fs are seen issuing instructions to their pilotless wingmen via touchscreen interfaces on tablet-like devices. The F-35 pilots are depicted using the same user interface via the wide-area display in their jets' cockpits. The user interface that is shown provides the ability to select multiple drones at once and to direct them to perform pre-set mission profiles ‚Äì including transit, defensive counter air (DCA), and combat air patrol (CAP) ‚Äì at least semi-autonomously. Depictions of a tablet-based touch-screen user interface for controlling drones, as well as one utilizing the F-35's wide-area cockpit display. Collins Aerospace capture In the video, the drones are ordered first to transit to a mission area before being switched over to the DCA mode. Doing this causes the CCAs to turn on their sensors and begin scanning, at which point various threats ‚Äì a mix of Flanker variants and Chinese J-20 stealth fighters ‚Äì are detected.

Note that the aircraft depicted here is wearing fictional national markings, but that China's People's Liberation Army is the only one to currently operate this aircraft. Collins Aerospace capture A pair of Flanker-type fighters seen in the Collins video. China also operates multiple Flanker variants and derivatives. Collins Aerospace capture One of the most commonly cited benefits of groups of drones tethered to piloted fighters in air-to-air combat is the ability of the uncrewed component to extend the sensor reach of the entire force without necessarily increasing the risks to the crewed component. For instance, CCAs could employ active sensors and pass the information they gather along to piloted fighters operating their sensor suites in a passive mode making them harder to detect. Crewed combat jets could also potentially engage enemies based on that targeting data forwarded from drone wingmen. With additional networking connectivity, the data collected by the complete crewed-uncrewed team could be pushed to other nodes, as well. Text narration in the Collins' video highlights how a human-machine team could 'collaborative search the battlespace, detecting threats building shared understanding, triangulating to generate target tracks.' It's also worth noting here that one of the key benefits of the IRST systems that the F-15s and F/A-18Fs are depicted carrying in the Collins' video is that they function passively, which also does not alert opponents to the fact that they are being tracked. IRSTs, which be paired with other sensors to provide additional capabilities, are also immune to radiofrequency electronic warfare jamming. You can read more about the value of IRSTs, which are seeing a renaissance in the U.S. military, here. The video from Collins subsequently shows U.S. fighters and CCAs engaging and shooting down a number of Chinese jets. Interestingly, the footage does not appear to depict any direct authorization being given to the drones before they fire their missiles. U.S. military officials have stressed repeatedly that, at least for the foreseeable future, a human operator somewhere 'on-the-loop' will always be responsible for authorizing uncrewed platforms in the air or anywhere else to employ lethal force. A notional CCA about to launch its AIM-120s. Collins Aerospace capture After combat concludes, the video shows different groups of CCAs being directed to maintain CAPs or return to base (RTB). As seen below, the user interface at this point in the computer-generated footage also shows what looks to be options for handing off control of the drones from the fighters to other aircraft, as well as ships and forces on the ground, and even nodes in space. The Air Force and Navy are already known to be working on ways to be able to seamlessly exchange control of CCAs in future operations. There has been talk of expanding portions of that architecture out to other branches of the U.S. military, as well as to allies and partners. Collins Aerospace capture The scenario outlined in the Collins' video is, of course, notional and, in many ways, truncated. A high-end aerial combat mission like this would likely occur across a much broader area with actual engagements occurring at beyond visual range. Notably absent entirely in the footage are hostile uncrewed combat air vehicles (UCAV) and other drones, which the Chinese aviation sector is very actively developing. When it comes to stealthy highly-autonomous flying wing UCAV, in particular, this is a space the United States has all but completely ceded to China, at least publicly.

U.S. military officials have routinely cited China's growing airborne early warning and control and aerial electronic warfare capabilities as being major expected factors in any future air-to-air engagement between the two countries. A Chinese Y-9LG standoff electronic warfare aircraft, a relatively new design that shares many characteristics with the country's KJ-200 airborne early warning and control aircraft. via X What Collins' has put out still presents an interesting outlook for what highly autonomous crewed-uncrewed teaming might look like in future high-end aerial combat. It also highlights questions about concepts of operations when it comes to executing these kinds of teamed air-to-air engagements, as well as basing and sustaining CCAs, that the Air Force, as well as the Navy, are still very much working to answer. The Air Force 'has talked about potentially having as many as 1,000 of these CCAs to use in a contingency,' Gen. Kenneth Wilsbach, head of Air Combat Command, said at a talk that the Air & Space Forces Association's Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies hosted earlier this year. 'And I think that‚Äôs a noble goal, and one that would create a lot of dilemmas as people think about getting into a fight with us and having to contend with that many, plus all of our manned platforms.' At the same time, 'you probably don‚Äôt need to fly that [CCA] aircraft every day,' Wilsbach continued. 'And in fact, what we think is that we‚Äôll have these aircraft available to fly, but they won‚Äôt fly that often. And the benefit of that is you don‚Äôt need the maintenance. You don‚Äôt need the long-term sustainment, and so you get a lot more airframes for a given amount of money.' Wilsbach added at that time that the drones would likely be kept essentially in 'flyable storage' and 'in a hangar and they‚Äôll be ready to fly' most of the time, only being brought out when necessary. You can read more about the benefits of an operational concept like this in this past War Zone feature. Collins Aerospace capture Exactly how CCAs will be controlled and what levels of autonomy may truly be available in the near term to support all of this still very much remains to be seen, as well. 'There's a lot of opinions amongst the Air Force about the right way to go [about controlling drones from other aircraft],' John Clark, Lockheed Martin Vice President and General Manager of Advanced Development Programs (ADP), better known as Skunk Works, told The War Zone and others at this year's Air & Space Forces Association's (AFA) Air, Space & Cyber Conference earlier this week. 'The universal thought, though, is that this [a tablet or other touch-based interface] may be the fastest way to begin experimentation. It may not be the end state.' 'We're working through a spectrum of options that are the minimum invasive opportunities, as well as something that's more organically equipped, where there's not even a tablet,' Clark added. Testing to date has exposed potential issues around using tablets and other touch interface systems. 'We started with [the Air Force‚Äôs] Air Combat Command with tablets‚Ä¶ There was this idea that they wanted to have this discreet control,' Michael Atwood, Vice President of Advanced Programs for General Atomics, said during an appearance on The Merge podcast earlier this year. 'I got to fly in one of these jets with a tablet. And it was really hard to fly the airplane, let alone the weapon system of my primary airplane, and spatially and temporally think about this other thing.' At that time, Atwood advocated for ceding greater control to drones under human supervision. An example of an actual tablet-based drone control system General Atomics has experimented with in the past. GA-ASI 'We know two things about autonomy,' Andrew Hunter, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology & Logistics, told The War Zone and other outlets at a media roundtable on the sidelines of this week's AFA conference. 'One is laws of war require us to have, you know, human engagement in key decisions involving employment of weapons and other key decisions. So we have to have that. We have to have that human engagement, the ability to do that. The second is [that] we know that our ability to create systems that can operate autonomously and do missions well is something that is still maturing.' 'So, in other words, there are things that we know that we already know how to do well with autonomy, and there's things that we know we do not know how to do well with autonomy,' Hunter continued. 'So we're going to stick to the things we know we can do well, and then have humans do the other things, and, over time, that mix is going to change&#8230; it's not going to be static.' With the Air Force pushing hard to begin fielding its first operational CCAs by the end of the decade, it should become increasingly clear in the coming years how well Collins' vision does or doesn't align with reality.

Israeli Airstrikes In Lebanon Intensify	Israel has launched its most intense airstrikes on Lebanon since the start of the Gaza war almost a year ago. The raids, launched by Israeli Air Force (IAF) aircraft late on Thursday, and centered upon southern Lebanon and Beirut, follow the unprecedented series of explosions targeting electronic devices belonging to Hezbollah members in that country, earlier this week. Israel claims that a significant number of leading Hezbollah commanders were killed in an airstrike on Beirut today. As more members of the international community call upon both sides for restraint, Israel and Hezbollah appear closer to all-out war than they have been at any point in the last 12 months or so. People gather in front of a building targeted by an Israeli strike in Beirut's southern suburbs on September 20, 2024. The strike on Hezbollah's stronghold in Lebanon's capital Beirut reportedly killed at least eight people and wounded dozens of others, with a source close to the movement saying a top military leader was dead.

Nasrallah said Hezbollah hoped Israeli troops would enter southern Lebanon, providing the militant group with an 'historic opportunity' to take them on in battle. Israel will face 'a crushing response from the Axis of Resistance,' Iran‚Äôs Revolutionary Guards Commander Hossein Salami said yesterday, according to state media. Iran is the major military backer of Hezbollah, while the Axis of Resistance refers to other Iran-aligned militant groups including Hamas, the Houthis in Yemen, and various armed groups in Iraq and Syria. Today, the Iranian Embassy in Lebanon also directly condemned the airstrike in Beirut, describing it as 'Israeli madness and arrogance.' In a post on X, the Iranian Embassy wrote: 'In the strongest terms the Israeli madness and arrogance that crossed all limits by targeting residential areas in the southern suburbs of Beirut‚Ä¶ We reaffirm once again that such terrorist crimes will not undermine the determination and faith of the Lebanese.

A Peak Into The Future Of Offensive Electronic Warfare	Electronic warfare (EW) has taken on new prominence as the threat from near-peer adversaries has ballooned in recent. Who can best dominate the radio frequency spectrum and take the electronic fight directly to the enemy will have a massive advantage in tomorrow battles. To find out more about the state of play in offensive EW, we sat down with Chuck Angus, director of business development in Naval Power at Raytheon. He oversees the company's cutting-edge offensive electronic warfare (EW) portfolio. Angus talked with The War Zone about the latest in offensive EW, his company's new AN/ALQ-249(V)1 Next Generation Jammer-Mid Band (NGJ-MB) electronic warfare pods (currently installed on EA-18G Growlers aboard the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln) and the applicability of such systems on sixth-generation fighters and loyal wingman drones. This conversation, which took place on the sidelines of the Air & Space Forces Air, Space & Cyber conference in National Harbor, Maryland, has been slightly edited for clarity. The AN/ALQ-249(V)1 Next Generation Jammer-Mid Band (NGJ-MB). (Raytheon) Q: Talk about how electronically scanned array (AESA) antennas like those on the NGJ will improve offensive EW. A: What‚Äôs interesting is that AESA arrays can do lots of things differently than some of the steerable arrays that we had. So essentially, the AESAs, based on their field of regard, can do a lot of things in a lot of places simultaneously, and so you think about electronic attack systems like NGJ, where we've got eight AESA arrays from that, for those, for that shipset, from those two pods. And it can do a lot of things for a large breadth of area. An exploded view of the components inside Raytheon‚Äôs NGJ-MB pod. (USN) If we talk about electronic attack per se, the way those arrays are set up, the way it was designed, is that, is that I can attack an adversary out the front and the side, and then as I'm ingressing. Once I egress, that system, working together, can move those assignments from one set of arrays, from the front to the back, from the left pod to the right pod. The point of it is, is that when you have that multifunctioning array, and you have some autonomy that goes with it, you can move those assignments or jobs or whatever it's going to be doing, whether it's comms or delivering payloads or whatever it is, it can do it around that platform, even while it's making a turn. So I think it's really, really important. And fire control radar, is the same way, right? So now you got a fire control radar, and you've got a sensor and stuff, and if you get them all fused together, I think that that's a very valuable contribution. (You can read all about what multi-function AESA arrays distributed around an aircraft are capable of in this past special feature of ours.) NAVAIR Q: What kind of effects can next-generation EW have on adversary systems? Can it destroy radar seekers on incoming missiles, for instance? A; I'll talk about offensive electronic attack, because that's distinguishing it from self-protect, right? So as an example, what you're really trying to do is protect a protected entity with another entity. So, as an example, a Growler flying in formation with a [F/A-18] Super Hornet, right? The Growler is not protecting itself. That's not what it's about. It's protecting the Super Hornets flying out in front of it. And so it's protecting that Super Hornet by denying that adversary radar from detecting it so it can drive in closer and drop its weapons right again when you ingress and egress, you can stay on that target at the same time. So not only is it reducing the detection range of a platform that's dropping weapons, it's also protecting that platform against an air-to-air threat. So maybe it's a Chinese fighter or a Russian fighter. If you can reduce that fighter's ability to see you, you get a chance to shoot first. Great combat advantage. The other thing, I think it's really important, is when we talk about magazine depth, and everybody's interested in 'how many weapons do I have?' So again, if you can reduce that adversary radar from seeing that weapon that‚Äôs inbound until it gets really, really close, then you're going to improve that capability to attack that target, support those weapons all the way to target, reducing the amount of weapons you have to fire, right? And, by definition, increasing your magazine depth. A VAQ-133 EA-18G with NGJ-MB pods lands on board the USS Abraham Lincoln. (USN ) Q: Can it affect inbound air-to-air missiles? A: I probably can't talk much about that. I'll say it this way, if a weapon was using a radar and you had the ability to affect a radar, I could imagine that there may be some effect. Q: What about distributing EW to platforms across the battlespace and connecting them for cooperative EW via networking? How far along is this and what are the advantages? A: Certainly a lot of advantages. And I think the advantages, besides the fact that the guy over here can send an assignment hundreds of miles away, and get something done over there, that's an incredible advantage. I think the ability to team them together on a specific target would also be an advantage. One of the things that we talk about in electronic attack is the ability to do simultaneous targets, multiple simultaneous targets, with multiple techniques. So the ability to attack this target while the same time attacking another target from the same AESA array that you've that you've divided. That‚Äôs the idea behind the AEASs. You don't have to turn it. You can divide it and split that beam. So not only can you attack multiple simultaneous targets, but you can also move from one to the other really, really quick. And I think that's one of the great benefits of something like an electronic attack that you can move quickly so sometimes that threat radar may not even know that you've left it and gone to something else. So imagine multiplying that capability across the board. It doesn't have to be a small platform. It can be much larger platforms. It can be multiple types of aircraft, bombers, fighters, maritime patrol, UAS, and mobility aircraft, right? That whole thing can enable that joint fight. And it's not just about the capability, it's about the capacity. That was your point. Your point was, ‚Äòhow can I increase the capacity?‚Äô Then working together. That's what you're doing. You're increasing the capacity. A graphic giving a very general look at different jamming mission profiles, with the EA-18G seen here providing so-called 'modified escort jamming' from outside the range of enemy ground-based air defenses. The NGJ-MB pods are capable of supporting other profiles, as well. (GAO) Q: Are you looking at cognitive electronic warfare on this? A: ‚Äã‚ÄãSo that's important, and we have been looking at it, but I can't really discuss the work that's going on. Q: What can EW do as far as making things appear to the enemy that are not there? A: So the nice thing about having a software-defined radio is that any equation that can be built in MATLAB [a programming platform designed specifically for engineers and scientists to analyze and design systems and products], you can project. So you can imagine that you could do a lot of things with RF energy. I can't talk about some other things that it can go do. But certainly, there are a lot of effects that you can do with AESA arrays and different techniques. Q: What do you think EW will look like on a Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) sixth-gen fighter or a collaborative combat aircraft (CCA)? A: Well, I understand that there are still some requirements generation going on about what those missions are, but it's clear to me that electronic attack is an enabler. It has to have a position as part of that, right? Is it high-powered? That's a great question. It probably depends on the platform. Right? Is it going to be very directed, is it going to be attritable? Because it‚Äôs a question about what that solution is. Could it be carried in a pod? It could be carried in a pod. It would be a small pod, but I still think you have to have power generation capability, because some of these platforms are maybe power starved anyway. A model of General Atomics‚Äô CCA design on display at the AFA conference this week. Jamie Hunter Q: That sounds like a difficult challenge. A: It is a difficult challenge and that's why you see something like an NGJ, which has its own power system. Because once it's airborne, it doesn't need any power from the airplane. It has its own. NGJ has a ram air turbine generator. It has doors on both sides that open up when it's airborne, and it takes the air through those doors, turns a turbine and generates 82 kW. Q: Would some version of the NGJ fit in a CCA at some point? Is it something you're considering looking at? A: I think the market is heading towards smaller form factor, as you're describing. So I think there's opportunity there. Q: Is that something you are actually pursuing? A: We've been investing in a smaller form factor. I can't just tell you who've been working with on it, but you know, NGJ is 14 feet, 1,200 pounds. Depending on the size of the platform, you may have to have something smaller. (Raytheon) Q: Can you talk about what kind of platform? Crewed? Uncrewed? A: I think both, there's no reason why you couldn't do it. NGJ in itself is pretty autonomous, especially if you've done the mission plan. A lot of those assignments are mission-planned, so you really don't need any operator intervention. And we don't talk about managing the assignments anymore. It's not like the guy in the back is [doing] pushing-the-buttons kind of stuff. What we're doing is managing the priorities of those assignments. So if it's that radar you want to go after, that's a higher priority than this other one. So mission-plan the priority of those assignments, and It'll prosecute those targets autonomously. Q: Has NGJ achieved initial operational capability (IOC) yet? A: You'll have to talk to the Navy about IOC and deployment. What I can tell you is that we're delivering pods to the Navy. Operational testing has gone extremely well. Q: When was the operational test? A: Well, I think there's still some pieces of it ongoing. But performance has been very, very good. Q: Have you gotten any feedback or lessons learned from that [deployment on an operational cruise]? A: Just like any new weapon system, I think when you put it in the hands of the operator, you learn something because those guys are smarter than you and I both. And they find new ways to use things. I think every day we learn something from operational tests, developmental tests, because the guys are actually putting it through its paces. Q: But have you gotten any feedback from the Lincoln, which arrived with the pods in the U.S. Central Command region last month? A: I can't tell you what they're doing operationally and where they are. What I can tell you is that we have field service representatives who support the squadrons. And we get feedback. A VAQ-133 Growler assigned to the USS Abraham Lincoln with AN/ALQ-249(V)1 Next Generation Jammer-Mid Band (NGJ-MB) pods under its wings. (USN) Q: Has anything that's happened on Lincoln come back to you to figure out how to make things better? A: We get all kinds of feedback from the Navy. Okay? I just can't describe where it is. So I think what you're starting to hear around is that everybody loves the Growler and NGJ. But there are only so many Growlers and so many NGJs, right? You can put this on the non-traditional EW platforms, the bombers, the fighters, maritime patrol, UAS‚Ä¶ Q: Tankers? A: Tankers. You can put it on those, and you can automatically increase the EA capacity in the fight. And the other thing, and I'll mention quickly, is that if you put it on a bomber whose primary mission is to shoot weapons, that's what they're there for, they're going to drop weapons. So that non-kinetic effect of electronic attack is an enabler‚Ä¶it increases the capability of that kinetic effect, right? It's really interesting working them together like that, and it's something we hadn't talked about. And again, increasing the magazine depth. Q: Where are the adversaries like China and Russia on offensive EW? Can you say what you might be learning from them? A: I think we learn from them every day. And then some things we learned that maybe we've known, and some things that we probably didn't understand at the time, but I think it's a very interesting threat landscape right now. And my belief is that electronic attack is one of those disruptive technologies and capabilities that's really needed to prosecute the war, whether it's in the South China Sea, or there's [U.S. European Command] EUCOM and support with NATO wherever. I think it's an incredible enabler. Revolutionary change. Q: How would you rate China‚Äôs capabilities in terms of offensive EW? For instance, its Y-9LG electronic warfare aircraft recently took part in military drills with Thailand. A: I don‚Äôt think there's anything like what we have in the inventory. But clearly they have - like everybody else - they've moved the ball rather quickly on EW. Everybody has because technology is getting better. So they're not doing the scanning antennas anymore, right? They're doing something different. They're using GaN [Gallium Nitride] in places, right? So I think it's really, really important. It is believed that China's Y-9LG jammer aircraft uses its powerful electronically scanned radar beams to suppress enemy radar signals. (Via Twitter) via X Q: How about the Russians? Can you assess their offensive EW capabilities? A: I really can't, I can just tell you that, just like the Chinese - and everybody - they‚Äôve advanced their EW capabilities. Q: This is an Air Force trade show. Talk about how putting NGJ on Navy Growlers helps the Air Force. A: The [non-recurring engineering] NRE [cost] is done for NGJ, essentially, right? The DoD spent $3 billion, probably a little more than that, over all the NRE. So a service or a country could essentially pick that system up as it is and be able to use it. You'll need to do some integration, that kind of stuff. But certainly, all the heavy lifting has been done. So there's opportunity there, and of course, you drive the cost down. The other piece that we're investing in, and the Navy's investing in, is our production facility in Forest, Mississippi, where we're now increasing the capability to test faster, to develop faster, and to produce it quicker. End of interview. Despite its importance, EW overall hasn't historically received the budgetary support some U.S. military leaders say it deserves, a point Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall drove home during his keynote speech at the AFA conference. 'We started looking closely at electronic warfare for several reasons,' he said. 'First of all, we thought it was a key enabler in almost every one of our operating barriers. Second, most of our electronic warfare programs are platform-centered, so there was a unifying focus on this area as a whole. My own experience suggested that this is a historically neglected area that can be that can have an oversized impact, but doesn't compete well with our internal budget values relative to other priorities. We established cross-cutting operational neighborhood structure in this area try to bring more focused and conscious consideration to electronic warfare.' Whether Kendall can match his support for robust EW with commensurate funding is something we will watch closely. There has been growing chatter about the F-15EX getting Next Generation Jamming pods to tie into its extremely advanced electronic warfare system, but that hasn't been formalized at this time. There are significant investments being made in the new EQ-37 Compass Call fleet as well as updating the electronic warfare systems on existing fighters. The biggest leap may come with the F-35 Block IV, which will have an EW system that is touted as the most important aspect of the Block IV upgrade. All these elements and more could contribute to a new distributed EW strategy for the USAF that will only be bolstered by CCAs, new air-launched effects weapons and aircraft like the NGAD fighter and B-21 Raider. Clearly other developments are also happening in the classified realm. But considering the threat posed by China and Russia's own growing EW capabilities, more funds flowing toward controlling the radio frequency spectrum are more likely than not.

Collaborative Combat Aircraft Program 'Ingesting' Modular Chassis...	The U.S. Air Force says the once-secretive Off-Board Sensing Station (OBSS) drone program has been fully folded into the service's Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) effort. General Atomics has already disclosed that its current CCA design is derived from the XQ-67 drone it developed for OBSS. The Air Force and General Atomics have done pioneering work on the idea of accelerating the development and production of different kinds of drones by using a common core 'chassis' that includes landing gear and critical mission and flight control computer systems through OBSS. It is now hoped that these concepts will be beneficial to future tranches of CCAs. The XQ-67A during its first flight on February 28, 2024. Courtesy photo via USAF Air Force officials offered new details about the relationship between the OBSS and CCA programs, as well as the earlier Low Cost Attritable Aircraft Platform Sharing (LCAAPS) effort, at the Air & Space Forces Association's (AFA) main annual conference just outside of Washington, D.C., earlier this week. A model of General Atomics' CCA design on display at the AFA conference this week. Jamie Hunter '[Speaking] from the [Air Force] Test Center [AFTC] perspective, but also having some experience with the Lab [the Air Force Research Laboratory; AFRL], we went through a long process of developing that technology,' Air Force Maj. Gen. Scott Cain told The War Zone and others at a media roundtable on the sidelines of the AFA conference yesterday. 'Our steps that we took &#8230; were proving out that system [the XQ-67] and making sure that it got through that first flight and airworthiness. And now that has been picked up &#8230; that program, OBSS, &#8230; did a seamless transition over to the CCA program.' Maj. Gen. Cain is the current head of AFTC and was previously in charge of AFRL. The XQ-67 broke cover in February, as The War Zone was first to report, and the drone took the skies for the first time later that month. In February, AFRL also presented the first real public chronology of how it arrived at OBSS, as you can read more about here. Simply put, a direct line flows from the Low Cost Attritable Aircraft Technologies (LCAAT) initiative, which kicked off in 2014, to LCAAPS in 2018, and then to OBSS in 2021. An explicit link from OBSS to CCA was not drawn at that time. CCA is leveraging other efforts, past and present, including the Air Force's Skyborg project, as well. LCAAT also separately led to the Low Cost Attritable Strike Demonstrator (LCASD) project under which the Air Force acquired its first example of the Kratos XQ-58 Valkyrie drone. At least a concept for an armed, higher-performance companion to the OBSS 'sensor truck' drone, called the Off-Board Weapons Station (OBWS), also exists. It is unknown whether or not an actual uncrewed aircraft is being developed, or already has been, as part of the exploration of OBWS. A key element of both OBSS and OBWS, and the overarching LCAAPs effort, was the idea of very modular designs using a high degree of common physical architecture. The Air Force and General Atomics have since described the idea of a common core as a 'genus' from which multiple 'species' of very differently configured drones can be created. Ahead of the AFA conference, AFRL put out the video below about LCAAPS and its underlying philosophy. 'So the Test Center supported the Lab in getting XQ-67 to that first flight and to do some early characterization of the platform,' Maj. Gen. Cain added at the roundtable yesterday. 'There are other lessons from this about building a common chassis that will be carried forward. And the CCA program is ingesting those and thinking about those for future increments of the system.' The CCA program is structured around relatively rapid iterative development cycles. General Atomics and Anduril are currently developing designs as part of the first cycle, or Increment One. The Air Force is also in the process of finalizing requirements for Increment Two. A model of Anduril's Fury drone, which it is now developing under the CCA program, that was shown at the AFA conference this week. Jamie Hunter As already noted, General Atomics has confirmed that its Increment One CCA is based on the XQ-67. The company is also now marketing an entire family of drones called Gambit that leverage a common core chassis. 'There's an [XQ-67] OBSS down there [on the AFA show floor]. &#8230; There's also [model of] a General Atomics CCA offering down there,' Air Force Gen. Duke Richardson, head of Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC), said at the same media roundtable yesterday as Maj. Gen. Cain. 'So they might be similar, but they're not exact. So if you look at them closely, they're not exact. So we definitely learned a lot from the XQ-67.' That OBSS and CCA are directly linked at a programmatic level is not surprising. In February, The War Zone highlighted the similarities in language being used to describe key elements of both programs, as how well the then newly disclosed OBWS concept seemed to align with the Air Force's CCA plans, writing: 'Overall, OBSS looks more and more like it is at least a related exploratory effort running in parallel to the CCA program, and one that could be a key stepping stone for the latter to achieve its ambitious goals. The potential existence of an armed, higher-performance drone developed under OBWS, or at least the exploration of such a design, would also align with the CCA effort.' Interestingly, Michael Atwood, Vice President of Advanced Programs for General Atomics, described the company's CCA entry 'as more of a weapons station' to the XQ-67's 'sensor station in an exclusive interview with The War Zone from the AFA convention floor, which you can find here. A graphical depiction of the core 'genus/species' concept behind LCAAPS and, by extension, OBSS. USAF capture The Air Force's confirmation now of an explicit link between OBSS, and by extension LCAAPS, and CCA is still significant and raises new and interesting questions about how this focus may impact the latter program. The Air Force has already made clear that, win or lose, contractors can compete in as many increments of the program as they want. In addition, the service has said that companies not selected to develop CCA designs could still get contracts to actually build them in order to help meet its ambitious production and fielding timelines. Even having contractors utilize a centralized pool of components to some degree could help further accelerate these schedules, while also helping to reduce costs and streamline supply chains for sustainment down the road. It isn't clear what advantages the CCA program directly leveraging OBSS could provide to General Atomics. The Air Force does have a clear interest in the modular chassis approach that General Atomics has now done significant risk reduction prototyping on with the XQ-67, which is still being very actively tested. The XQ-67 on the ground. USAF Courtesy photo via USAF The hope currently is that General Atomics and Anduril will have their Increment One designs flying by the end of the end of next year, if not well before then, and that the first operational CCAs will enter service before the end of the decade. Increment Two is supposed to kick off next year, as well. 'So what should Increment 2 be? Do not assume and it may not be just an evolution of Increment 1. It could be an entirely different set of missions. Could be [an] entirely different kind of an aircraft,' Andrew Hunter, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology & Logistics, had said at the 2024 Defense News Conference earlier this month. 'And so part of that initial work is, again, starting with a large vendor pool, what are the good ideas out there? We‚Äôll have some ideas [about] what we think Increment 2 needs to do as part of a broader force, and that‚Äôs part of this broader look at air dominance and how we‚Äôre going to deliver that.' With what we know now, whatever CCAs the Air Force chooses to buy under any increment of the program could well look very different outwardly, but be much more similar inside than meets the eye.

How Israel Turned Hezbollah‚Äôs Pagers Into Exploding Trojan Horses	Details are starting to come to light about how Israel apparently orchestrated two days of coordinated explosions targeting thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah in Lebanon. You can read our reporting of the first wave of explosions here, and the second wave here. At this point, it‚Äôs worth remembering that Israel has not admitted responsibility for the blasts, but it is now widely acknowledged that was behind them. Moreover, as we have discussed before, it would be entirely in keeping with what appears to be a developing plan for a full-scale military operation launched against Hezbollah. Addressing the first wave of explosions, on Tuesday, this targeted pagers used by Hezbollah. At 3:30 p.m. local time, it seems the pagers were triggered simultaneously, by a specific message. The message was one that looks, at least, as if it was sent by Hezbollah leadership. A communication device on the ground as the Lebanese Army prepares to destroy it in a controlled explosion, in southern Lebanon between the villages of Burj al Muluk and Klayaa, on September 19, 2024. Photo by Rabih DAHER / AFP RABIH DAHER This suggests a modification of the software in the pager that in turn triggered an explosion. However, based on eyewitness accounts, the pagers didn‚Äôt explode immediately after the message arrived, but with a slight delay. A bleep and then a pause would give time for the device to be picked up and even brought closer to the face of whoever owned it. This would correspond with reports of multiple hand and facial injuries among those targeted. Modifying the pagers to respond in a specific way to a particular message is one thing, but then there‚Äôs the fact that each seems to have contained a small amount of explosive. The physical sabotage of the devices would also have required this explosive to be added, although not necessarily much. Even a few grams of explosive would likely be enough to inflict life-changing injuries. All of this put together indicates a very elaborate operation to get appropriately sabotaged pagers into Hezbollah‚Äôs hands. According to an investigation by The Guardian newspaper, the pagers were AR-924 models from a Taiwanese manufacturer, Gold Apollo. The Taiwanese firm has since said that the manufacture of these devices was carried out by a subcontractor, BAC Consulting, which is based in Hungary, but which bears all the hallmarks of a front company. The related deal was apparently signed three years ago. CEO of Gold Apollo, Hsu Ching-Kuang denied manufacturing the explosive pager. When asked abt AR-924, he said 'it is produced & sold by BAC‚Ä¶we only provide brand trademark authorisation & have no involvement in design or manufacturing of this product.' See my exchange w him. pic.twitter.com/eb6k65oyKl&mdash; Tingting Liu Âäâ‰∫≠Âª∑ (@tingtingliuTVBS) September 18, 2024 The exact status of BAC Consulting is something of a mystery, with its website having gone offline yesterday. Its chief executive, Cristiana B√°rsony-Arcidiacono, confirmed to NBC that her company had links to Gold Apollo, but that BAC Consulting was 'just the intermediate.' Hungarian officials have also said the pagers were not made in Hungary. Israel didn‚Äôt intercept the pagers. It built a fake company and manufactured the pagers themselves. Imagine the paranoia that must be running through Hezbollah now. If Israel can do this, what it can it do in a war? No wonder they‚Äôre so afraid to escalate. pic.twitter.com/LgaRuPa0Gu&mdash; Richard Hanania (@RichardHanania) September 19, 2024 Wherever the modified pagers were produced, they were fitted with an explosive device and the requisite software and then supplied to Hezbollah ‚Äî this is perhaps the most remarkable part of the story. The implication is that Israeli intelligence knew that the militant group was in the market for a large quantity of pagers ‚Äî around 5,000. Ironically, the acquisition of the devices had been encouraged by the group‚Äôs leadership since pagers were deemed to be safer than mobile phones. Israel, therefore, became aware of Hezbollah‚Äôs demand for pagers and then managed the entire production and delivery process ‚Äî including a plausible-looking supply chain ‚Äî to ensure that they were distributed and that the entire plan remained a closely guarded secret. In the time between the devices having been issued to Hezbollah and the explosions this week, the fact that they were used for encrypted communications means that Israel was also very likely reading all their traffic and reaping a significant intelligence windfall. A photo taken on September 18, 2024, in Beirut's southern suburbs, shows the remains of exploded pagers on display at an undisclosed location. Photo by AFP - The second wave of explosions, on Wednesday, targeted walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah. Fewer details have emerged about these, but it seems highly likely that the devices were tampered with and distributed in a similar way. The results, however, are beyond doubt. The blasts on Tuesday killed 12 and injured up to 2,800 more, while those on Wednesday killed 14 and left more than 450 more injured. Just as importantly for Israel, the explosions created chaos and confusion, stripping Hezbollah of secure communications and eroding its chain of command. A review of operational security within the group will also have tied up further resources and caused yet more disruption. There have also been other effects, including the announcement today that Qatar Airways would refuse to allow passengers to bring pagers or walkie-talkies onto its flights. Effective immediately: Following the directive received from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation of the Republic of Lebanon, all passengers flying from Beirut Rafic Harirl International Airport (BEY) are prohibited from carrying pagers and walkie-talkies on board flights.‚Ä¶&mdash; Qatar Airways (@qatarairways) September 19, 2024 Interestingly, there are suggestions that Israel may have rushed the operation amid fears that it was about to get compromised. Unnamed U.S. officials apparently told Axios that the decision to trigger the devices this week was made due to concerns that Hezbollah was poised to uncover the nature of the plot. 'It was a use it or lose it moment,' one U.S. official told Axios. As can be easily imagined, the terrifying nature of electronic devices exploding on command has also resulted in a general panic among the population in Lebanon. There have been reports of other electronic items exploding, including solar power systems and fingerprint readers, although there has been no independent confirmation of devices other than pagers and walkie-talkies having been affected. Photos of damaged and burned iPhones have appeared on social media. At least some of these have been debunked, but they do show the degree to which the population is now fearing what might happen next. This image is being circulated in relation to reports of exploding devices in Lebanon today. However, Google's image reverse search shows that the same image was published on 19 Mar 2021.Source: pic.twitter.com/bN3g5BTJSt&mdash; Centre for Information Resilience (@Cen4infoRes) September 18, 2024 All this has been seen as a likely prelude to a more sustained military campaign launched against Hezbollah and, with airstrikes already happening in the south of Lebanon, such an operation may already be taking shape. | #Lebanon: Israeli Air Force carried out series of airstrikes near the town of Hermel in northeastern Lebanon, near the border with Syria, tonight.The town of Hermel is located over 130km from the border with Israel. pic.twitter.com/8tv2OlMI4I&mdash; Status-6 (Military & Conflict News) (@Archer83Able) June 10, 2024 At the same time, the explosions not only brought death and injury to Hezbollah but also led to casualties among Lebanon‚Äôs civilian population, which resulted in a backlash from the international community. The weaponization of electronic devices in this way has caused alarm, with the monitoring group Human Rights Watch noting that it contravenes human rights law, which specifically 'prohibits the use of booby traps ‚Ä¶ precisely to avoid putting civilians at grave risk.' This also raises the prospect of similar kinds of booby-trapped devices being utilized by non-state actors in the future. The possibility of a terror campaign making use of modified electronic devices sold in public online marketplaces is a very worrying one, and one that could exploit loopholes in existing supply chains to create widespread disruption. With the exploding pagers/electronics operation precedent, and considering how many crappy electronic devices from questionable vendors are sold on Amazon etc. it is worrying. A bad actor could hurt a lot of random people and cause a ton of havoc and disruption.&mdash; Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) September 19, 2024 You have an international delivery/distribution system and ability to communicate with the device out of the box.&mdash; Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) September 19, 2024 While the explosions may have been unprecedented in terms of scale, Israel has previously assassinated key figures using broadly similar methods. In 1996, Yahya Ayyash, the chief bombmaker of Hamas, was killed by an exploding cell phone. The device had been given to him by Israeli intelligence, who used it to eavesdrop on his conversations, before triggering a fatal explosion. The series of explosions this week came as a surprise, but there are also reports that the Israeli Minister of Defense, Yoav Gallant, called his U.S. counterpart Lloyd Austin only minutes before the first wave of blasts, alerting him to the fact that an operation in Lebanon was about to begin. The call falls short of a public acknowledgment of responsibility, and it seems that no specifics of the operation were revealed to Austin. Undoubtedly, the explosions have had a significant impact on Hezbollah and Lebanon, but the long-term results remain to be seen. For its part, Hezbollah has promised to avenge the attacks of the last two days. Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah‚Äôs leader, today threatened Israel with 'tough retribution and just punishment' and that this would happen 'where it expects it and where it does not.'

However, with the unprecedented explosions across Lebanon this week, Israel has laid down a significant marker of the lengths it is willing to go to tackle the militant group, using all means at its disposal.

AC-130J Ghostrider Gunships Will Keep Their 105mm Howitzers, For ...	The U.S. Air Force's top special operations officer says AC-130J Ghostrider gunships will continue being armed with 105mm howitzers for the time being, though this could still change in future. The service had been considering removing these weapons from the AC-130Js amid a growing debate about the relevance of the gunships in future high-end conflicts, such as one in the Pacific against China. Air Force Lt. Gen. Michael Conley, head of Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), talked about current and future plans for the AC-130Js with The War Zone and others at a media roundtable yesterday. The gathering came on the last day of the Air & Space Forces Association's 2024 Air, Space & Cyber Conference just outside Washington, D.C. An AC-130J Ghostrider. USAF 'The 105[mm howitzer] will continue to be relevant,' Conley said. 'The plan is to keep using that in the years to come.' AFSOC has some 31 AC-130Js in inventory, which are the only AC-130 variants now in service. The Ghostrider's current armament package includes a 105mm howitzer, as well as a single barrel 30mm GAU-23/A Bushmaster II automatic cannon. The gunships can also employ an array of precision-guided missiles and bombs via Common Launch Tubes (CLT) and underwing racks. You can learn more about how the Air Force AC-130s have evolved since the introduction of the original AC-130A version in the 1960s here and in The War Zone video below. Operational Ghostriders were initially delivered to AFSOC armed with modified versions of the 105mm M102 howitzer, a weapon that had been found on multiple preceding AC-130 variants dating back to the Vietnam War. The M102 was originally developed during the Cold War as a light towed artillery piece for the U.S. Army, which retired the last of its examples in the early 2000s. An AC-130J armed with a modified 105mm M102 howitzer. USAF A close-up look at the 105mm howitzer on an AC-130J. USAF With the M102s becoming increasingly unsupportable, the Air Force, in cooperation with the U.S. Navy, had begun acquiring improved 105mm howitzers for the AC-130J. As of November 2023, 17 Ghostriders had received replacement howitzers, referred to at the time by the interim nomenclature GAU-XX. At that time, however, AFSOC had also confirmed to The War Zone that further integrations had been put on hold 'pending the results of the assessment of capabilities of the AC-130J.' A look at the improved GAU-XX howitzer on an AC-130J at Yokota Air Base in Japan during an exercise in 2022. USAF Separate plans to arm a Ghostrider with a laser directed energy weapon, which had previously been described as ideally suited for use in counter-terrorism and other lower-intensity operations, were also notably scrapped last year. The War Zone has now reached back out to AFSOC about whether the GAU-XX integrations have resumed, how many AC-130Js now have the improved howitzers, and for other additional information. Speaking at the roundtable yesterday, Lt. Gen. Conley did acknowledge that there could be less emphasis on the 105mm howitzers when employing AC-130Js in a future high-end fight. 'As we look through our training portfolios and what we need to do for future fights, it probably involves less of the 105mm,' Conley said. 'It's got munitions that could sink a ship, &#8230; not a capital ship, not a carrier, but it could do damage to smaller ships.' 'In a peer fight, I think our spot is probably on the periphery,' he added. 'It [AC-130Js] could harass outlying [enemy] forces.' 'What the gunship's known for, in many cases, with our ground partners, is just the sound of freedom overhead and knowing that someone's there watching them,' Conley continued. The AFSOC commander's comments here followed the rare appearance of an AC-130J at a sinking exercise (SINKEX) in the Pacific in July. The SINKEX in question, where various assets were used to send the ex-USS Dubuque, a decommissioned U.S. Navy Austin class amphibious warfare ship, to the bottom of the ocean was part of the larger biennial Rim Of The Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise, which you can read more about here. At that time, The War Zone highlighted very similar kinds of potential roles and missions for AC-130Js, as well as challenges those aircraft would face, in a future major conflict, writing: 'During a future major conflict, just getting within gun range of a higher-value target like an amphibious warfare ship, likely operating as part of a larger group of warships further supported by air and other assets, would be a very tall order, if not impossible, for Air Force AC-130s. Ghostriders might still be able to leverage their guns against vessels in lower-risk areas or to help finish off severely damaged vessels separated from their companions. Armed overwatch over and around friendly forces on islands and anchorages could be another future maritime mission in a higher-end fight. It is worth noting that even during operations in largely permissive airspace over countries like Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan in the past 20 years or so, AC-130s have almost exclusively operated at night in large part to help reduce their vulnerability to potential threats.' 'We're looking at options for improved radars [and] other things that a traditional AC-130 would not have been asked to do,' Lt. Gen. Conley noted yesterday. The Air Force and U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) have a stated interest in adding new active electronically-scanned array (AESA) radars to the Ghostriders. These would give the aircraft important new targeting, threat warning, and potentially even electronic warfare capabilities, along with giving their crews generally improved situational awareness. AC-130Js already have a substantial and still-growing self-protection electronic warfare suite. Adding smaller and lower-cost cruise missiles to the AC-130J's arsenal to significantly increase its ability to launch stand-off strikes further away from enemy defenses is also increasingly on the horizon. Lt. Gen. Conley separately highlighted yesterday how AFSOC has been experimenting with using its MC-130 special operations tanker/transports as stand-off strike platforms using the Rapid Dragon palletized munitions system. AFSOC is looking to increasingly utilize autonomous capabilities, supported by advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, across all of its aircraft fleets and that could also impact how AC-130Js are employed in the future. 'I'd say [what] we're looking at in AFSOC &#8230; is an incremental approach, where what I am asking industry and my team to get after is, what are the things we can do inside the plane right now that allow the aircrew to focus on mission things and not the mechanics of flying an aircraft,' Lt. Gen. Conley said yesterday. 'So how do you fully automate [aircraft] startup and all that stuff where you hit a button and everything does it versus reading the old school checklist back and forth. The next step of that would be, okay, is there a point that we could reduce a crew member?' 'I think there's also an autonomy piece in our mission side, where &#8230; like with our [AC-130] gunship, you know, what can we do, as far as sensors and targeting to use the technology that's out there and getting better to help us with target identification, and kind of take the human out of the loop and put him or her on the loop,' he added. The head of AFSOC also repeatedly stressed that, while the U.S. military's primary focus is shifting to preparing for future high-end conflicts, the special operations community in particular remains heavily engaged in lower-intensity operations globally. Those missions, in turn, mean a need is still seen for the traditional capabilities that the AC-130 offers. This reality is also impacting discussions about plans for the planned fleet of OA-1K light attack aircraft, which are facing the same kinds of questions about future relevance as the Ghostriders. One of the Air Tractor AT-802U aircraft now being used to train Air Force pilots ahead of the delivery of the first OA-1K aircraft. The OA-1K is a derivative of the AT-802U. U.S. Air National Guard 'From when OA-1K was conceptualized and decided on until now, the world's changed a little bit. And so we look at some different opportunities with it. I think it still provides a cost-effective close air support platform, which is one of the missions that it was designed for. It's still going to provide an ISR [intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance] capability,' Conley explained. 'But as we move forward, I think there's opportunity to look at, again, some novel mission sets. &#8230;how quick can we get the wings on and off it so we could use it in some sort of crisis response, if we needed to? Where does the role of SIGINT, or ELINT or&#8230; some sort of ISR collect [factor in] there. I think there's opportunity for that. Again, not anything we've committed to yet.' Conley added that AFSOC's requirement currently remains for a fleet of 75 OA-1Ks despite discussions about potentially truncating those purchases. All this being said, AFSOC is clearly at a watershed moment in its history, as is the rest of the U.S. special operations community, after spending the bulk of the last two decades focused almost exclusively on counter-terrorism, counter-insurgency, and other lower-intensity operations. Plans for the AC-130J's future armament and other capabilities, as well as the gunship's expected roles and missions, are continuing to evolve as eyes turn to future high-end fights. In the meantime, at least, the Ghostriders will continue to wield their 105mm howitzers. Howard Altman contributed to this story.

B-21 Ground Test Airframes Join Flying Pre-Production Raider	The U.S. Air Force and Northrop Grumman have expanded testing of the B-21 thanks to two ground test articles, which are being used to evaluate the bomber's core construction and the time it takes before certain parts break. The tempo of flight testing of the initial pre-production Raider is also growing, with the jet now sometimes taking to the skies twice a week. The Air Force is otherwise continuing to lay the groundwork for fielding the first operation B-21s toward the end of the decade. The Air & Space Forces Association hosted a panel on the B-21 today as part of its main annual conference just out of Washington, D.C. Air Force Gen. Thomas Bussiere, head of Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), and Maj. Gen. Jason Armagost, the commander of Eighth Air Force, along with William 'Elvis' Bailey, the Director and Program Executive Officer of the Air Force's Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO), and Tom Jones, President of Northrop Grumman's Aeronautics Systems sector, offered updates about the Raider. The Air Force also released new official flight test footage of the B-21, seen below, alongside the panel discussion. 'We've completed structures testing for our first ground test vehicle,' RCO head Bailey announced. 'Now, what really we were doing there was proving out the structure, you know, of the platform, and also, at the same time, too, validating that digital model that we've been working on throughout ‚Äì trying to understand analytically how the aircraft's going to perform, then testing it and testing it physically, then going back to that model.' The structural ground test article is also referred to as G-1. 'We're doing fatigue testing on another ground model, as well, and we'll be getting into, you know, how does the aircraft age over time,' Bailey continued. 'It's just not as flashy as the flight test crowd is, however, if you intend to build a lot of these and operate them for a long time this is very important work.' When it comes to the first flying B-21, or T-1, 'we're going through and expanding that operating envelope for the aircraft, leading our way into follow-on system testing, for sure, learning as we go there,' the RCO head added. The Air Force ultimately expects to take delivery of six pre-production B-21s. The full Raider force is eventually expected to consist of at least 100 aircraft. An aerial view of the first pre-production B-21 during flight test. USAF 'We're actually able to generate two test flights, sometimes, week-in-week &#8230; that's great,' Northrop Grumman's Jones elaborated. 'When we started this journey, way back at contract award, we made a vow that we were going to design this system to be a daily flyer.' 'Clearly, I think we're well on our way to delivering that kind of asset,' he added. Jones said that the B-21 program continues to meet its affordability and schedule targets, but did not elaborate. He added that testing to date has proven the company's digital modeling of the B-21 and its capabilities to be highly accurate. 'Everything we've heard is it flies very much like the model. In fact, a funny story I like to tell about the first flight. We're all very excited to hear from the test pilot&#8230; he said 'it's almost exactly like the model, but we noticed on takeoff, it rotated slightly differently,' Jones recalled. 'So engineers being engineers, they didn't want their model to be wrong. So they pulled off all of the recorded data and looked at it and went back to the test pilot&#8230; [to] say, 'actually, you kind of double-pumped the stick, and when we put that into the simulation it performed exactly the way the simulation said it would, so the model itself is very good.'' 'Overall, I am pleased to see the performance of our test jet. The handling qualities are better than expected coming out of the simulated environment ‚Äì validating the accuracy of the digital models the team has developed and analyzed over many years,' Chris 'Hoss' Moss, a Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider test pilot, said separately in a statement in a press release the company put out today. Photo courtesy of David Henry, Northrop Grumman Northrop Grumman and the Air Force have both cited the importance of highly accurate models and digital engineering techniques in the development of the B-21 since the initial contract was awarded back in 2015. This has continued in spite of growing criticism that digital engineering's benefits have at least been over-hyped, in general, a viewpoint that the current Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall has himself espoused. When it comes to the B-21, Jones also said that digital engineering had helped reduce risks associated with concurrency, which refers to a system entering production despite the design not being completely finalized in many respects. The pre-production B-21 configuration is understood to be very close to that of the first production examples in large part thanks to modeling done earlier in development. 'If you are around acquisitions a lot, and you heard someone say, 'we're in tests and also in production,' a lot of people would start worrying about something we concurrency, right,' Jones explained. 'And that's something that, traditionally, there's been a lot of risk in, but I believe the digital engineering environment&#8230; and the&#8230; contract management's allocation of risk mitigation actions we've done in concert with RCO has really been able to manage down risk.' Jones added that Northrop Grumman views the modeling for the B-21 to be accurate enough to directly inform test points and overall test planning and that it is now also factoring into the initial low-rate production of the bombers. USAF 'This is the way we're going to build things. We're retroactively putting it into other systems that we build. And I can't imagine going forward in any future designs or builds not adopting this type of &#8230; highly integrated digital model to shop floor methodology,' the Northrop Grumman executive said. The philosophy Jones described has also already been observed in the creation of the Model 437 Vanguard technology demonstrator jet by Northrop Grumman subsidiary Scaled Composites. Colin Miller, Vice President for Engineering within Northrop Grumman‚Äôs aeronautics sector, highlighted the influence digital engineering techniques from the B-21 program had on the Model 437 project in an exclusive interview with The War Zone on the latter aircraft that you can find here. Beyond digital engineering, 'in terms of advanced manufacturing, there's a lot of different techniques we're using. We're using robotics in a number of different places, from&#8230; automated fiber layup, in some cases, to automated robotic non-destructive inspection. So we're finding ways to build efficiency in there,' according to Jones. 'One of the areas that has produced some of the most gains is augmented reality. Started out basically just wanting to use augmented reality to get the shop floor instructions [to] where basically the technicians can see them as they're doing the operation and not have to run back and forth to the desk to consult drawings&#8230; And we realized, hey, we can superimpose subsystems and wiring and hydraulic tubing on there and speed up subassemblies.' In addition to the ongoing development and production of the B-21s themselves, the U.S. Air Force is also improving infrastructure, training personnel, and working on tactics, techniques, and procedures to help get ready to actually field the first operational Raiders. Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota is set to host the first operational squadron of the bombers, followed by units at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri and Dyess Air Force Base in Texas. 'You can get on Ellsworth Air Force Base, just drive around and look, it is a substantial lift is what is happening. It's impressive and it is similar to the aircraft itself,' Maj. Gen. Armagost said. 'It's falling on that wing [28th Bomb Wing]. It's falling on the airman. It is falling on the contractors who join with us and partner with us to really make that happen. It's quite impressive.' USAF The first B-21 in a hangar at Plant 42. USAF 'What we have done is modeled what we were calling the 'farm team' as led through the mighty Eighth Air Force, but also directly led through the 31st Test and Evaluation Squadron at Edwards,' Armagost continued. 'And we are gathering from around the Air Force instructors who are experts in their systems and we're bringing them together along the model of operators with industry and acquirers to develop TTPs [tactics, techniques, and procedures] to understand differently how we're going to use this penetrating system, this sixth generation penetrating system, in a way that we have to work our way through so that when we have it on the ramp at Ellsworth Air Force Base, we're ready to do that.' 'We're trying to be very ahead of how we might actually deploy this airplane. And I would say that's what's different about the B-21 from the B-2,' Armagost continued. 'I think we learned some lessons early on in the B-2 program that maybe we could have done it slightly differently along these lines.' By all indications, the Air Force, together with Northrop Grumman, is making progress in not just getting its hands on its first production B-21s, but having them in operational service in the 2030s.

More Electronics Explode In Lebanon As Israel Declares ‚ÄòNew Phase...	Following yesterday‚Äôs unprecedented explosions targeting pagers belonging to thousands of Hezbollah members, which you can read about here, another wave of similar blasts has struck Lebanon. The second series of explosions seems to have targeted walkie-talkies used by members of the Iran-backed militant group, although there are suggestions that a variety of different electronic devices may have been affected. While Israel has not claimed responsibility for either of the two days‚Äô attacks, Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant today declared the start of a 'new phase' of the war with a focus on the northern front.

Three of those killed were said to have been in the Bekaa region in the east of the country. Many of the injuries were reported to victims‚Äô abdomens and hands, as was the case yesterday. People and first responders gather at the scene of a reported device explosion in Saida in southern Lebanon on September 18, 2024. Photo by Mahmoud ZAYYAT / AFP MAHMOUD ZAYYAT The Lebanese Red Cross said that more than 30 ambulances were deployed to 'multiple explosions' in Lebanon‚Äôs south and east, with another 50 ambulances put on alert to support rescue and evacuation operations. A Hezbollah source confirmed the nature of the attack, which so far bears many of the hallmarks of yesterday‚Äôs series of explosions, which was widely attributed to Israel. As was the case yesterday, when pagers were targeted, injuring more than 2,800 and killing 12, the explosions today were reportedly 'small in size.' A photo taken on September 18, 2024, in Beirut, shows the remains of exploded pagers on display at an undisclosed location.

Today, several solar power systems reportedly also exploded in people‚Äôs homes across Lebanon, according to the National News Agency, with at least one such blast injuring a girl in the town of al-Zahrani, south Lebanon.

Additional reports state that at least one of the models of walkie-talkie that exploded in Lebanon today was discontinued, but that Hezbollah got a shipment of them five months ago, around the same time that it appears to have received the pagers involved in yesterday‚Äôs blasts. This would clearly point to the devices being tampered with before they arrived in Hezbollah‚Äôs hands. However it was achieved, today‚Äôs events do at least suggest that many more types of electronic devices could have been modified into explosive devices, raising more questions about how the attacks were orchestrated, and whether more will come. The deeper implications of this dystopian development are something we have previously discussed at length. UPDATE - The radios that were booby-trapped in advance by Israeli intelligence services and then delivered to Hezbollah were part of the group's emergency communications system which was supposed to be used during a war with Israel, sources tell Axios  Faytuks News (@Faytuks) September 18, 2024 However, if Israel is now able to target Hezbollah members and associates via a variety of types of electronic devices, the last two days of attacks may also imply that Israel is poised to launch a large-scale campaign against the militant group. Not only do these explosions help remove key Hezbollah figures from the equation, but they also greatly reduce the group‚Äôs ability to communicate and maintain a chain of command. Then there is the significant factor of sowing fear and confusion within Hezbollah but also more broadly within Lebanon, comprising the group‚Äôs ability to operate more freely. Overloading the hospitals with injuries would be another impact of these detonations that would benefit an opposing force prior to a campaign. In a reflection of the chaos created by the blasts, there were reports today of Hezbollah members frantically pulling the batteries out of any walkie-talkies that had not exploded, and putting the parts in metal barrels, in case they detonated. Two sources tell Axios that Israel's goal in the second wave of attacks today was to increase paranoia and fear in Hezbollah's ranks pic.twitter.com/CJulO0jn7Q&mdash; Faytuks News (@Faytuks) September 18, 2024 As TWZ editor-in-chief Tyler Rogoway has observed, if Israel invested heavily into such an exotic espionage capability, it may be compelled to use it to its maximum extent as rapidly as possible if there was imminent risk of it being compromised. Under ideal circumstances, such measures would be exploited prior to or just at the beginning of a major military operation in order to degrade the opposing for as discussed above. Now there are signs that Israel is about to launch just such an operation. There are also reports that the detonation of these devices was rushed out of fears that the operation would be uncovered. Clearly, if you have the ability to detonate pagers and other electronic devices belonging to players in your adversary's ranks, you do it right before or at the start of a major military operation to:1.) Take many players, including key ones, off the board 2.) Cripple comms‚Ä¶&mdash; Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) September 18, 2024 International concern is building, too. Even before today‚Äôs explosions, U.N. Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres said it was 'very important' that civilian objects should not be weaponized. The U.N. chief said that yesterday‚Äôs explosions presented 'a serious risk of a dramatic escalation in Lebanon' and warned that 'everything must be done' to avoid that. He continued: 'What has happened is particularly serious, not only because of the number of victims that it caused, but because of the indications that exist that this was triggered, I would say, in advance of a normal way to trigger these things, because there was a risk of this being discovered.' I‚Äôm deeply alarmed by reports that a large number of communication devices exploded across Lebanon & Syria, killing at least 11 people, including children, and injuring thousands.All actors must exercise maximum restraint to avert any further escalation.&mdash; Ant√≥nio Guterres (@antonioguterres) September 18, 2024 The European Union‚Äôs top diplomat, Josep Borrell, described the device detonations in Lebanon as 'extremely worrying,' noting that they had caused 'heavy, indiscriminate collateral damage among civilians.' There are now other signs from Israel that it may well be poised to begin a more concerted campaign against Hezbollah, including unconfirmed reports of movements of large numbers of troops and armor toward the border.

Gen. Herzi Halevi, the head of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), said the country has drawn up plans for additional action against Hezbollah and is ready to strike. Halevi also warned that Israel has 'many more capabilities' that have not been used yet. 'We have many capabilities that we have not yet activated‚Ä¶ we have seen some of these things, it seems to me that we are well prepared, and we are preparing these plans going forward. At each stage, the price for Hezbollah needs to be high,' Halevi added.

Taken together, and potentially driven by the need to rush the electronics detonations, these developments may well indicate that a large-scale conflict between Israel and Hezbollah could be imminent, fueled by tensions that have increased dramatically in recent months.

New Look At B-21 Raider Stealth Bomber Flight Testing Released	The U.S. Air Force has released new video footage of its first pre-production B-21 Raider stealth bomber undergoing flight testing. The service just recently confirmed plans to field Raider squadrons at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri and Dyess Air Force Base in Texas, in addition to Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota that is set to be the home of the first operational B-21s. The Air Force released the video above around the Air & Space Forces Association's main annual conference, which wraps up today just outside Washington, D.C. Today also happens to be the Air Force's 77th birthday. The footage again various distinctive features of the B-21, including its unusual cockpit window arrangement, which you can read more about here. Also prominently visible are the Raider's two swing-up auxiliary intake doors. These help suck in more air for the engines during take-offs and landings where high power settings, steeper angles of attack, and slower speeds can be too much for the bomber's deeply-buried main inlets to handle alone. A previously released picture of the first pre-production B-21 highlighting its cockpit window arrangement and auxiliary intake doors. Photo courtesy of David Henry, Northrop Grumman Northrop Grumman's B-21 is the most advanced aircraft ever built, at least that we know about, and is the most significant development for the U.S. Air Force in recent memory, as The War Zone has explored in detail in the past. The first pre-production Raider, which took to the skies for the first time from Plant 42 in Palmdale, California last November and is now at Edwards Air Force Base in the same state, is also said to be very representative of the final production configuration. Five more pre-production examples are in various stages of being built. The Air Force currently plans to buy at least 100 B-21s, but there have already been discussions about a larger total fleet size. As already noted, the first operational Raiders are set to head to Ellsworth and the hope is that the bombers will be flying real missions before the end of the decade. The Air Force will then move to establish B-21 squadrons at Whiteman and Dyess. 'We continue to achieve B-21 production milestones; through digital engineering and open architecture design, we are getting an agile strategic deterrent that delivers a decisive response as required,' Air Force Gen. Thomas Bussiere, head of Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), said in a statement last week. This accompanied the formal announcement that B-21s will be headed to Whiteman and Dyess. USAF Before then, the expanding force of pre-production B-21s based at Edwards will be put through extensive testing. 'We are in the flight test program, the flight test program is proceeding well,' Andrew Hunter, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology & Logistics, told members of Congress in May. 'It is doing what flight test programs are designed to do, which is helping us learn about the unique characteristics of this platform, but in a very, very effective way.' The new video underscores this important testing work as the Air Force moves toward fielding its first B-21s in the coming years.

Work Toward KC-135 Tankers That Fly Themselves, Uncrewed Cargo Ai...	The U.S. Air Force is pushing ahead with experimentation that could lead to the transformation of KC-135 tankers into optionally crewed aircraft, as well as the development of other autonomous aerial refueling capabilities. U.S. military interest in autonomous airlifters, an area where China has been notably surging forward in the past few years, is also growing. Air Force Gen. Jacqueline Van Ovost, head of U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM), discussed work on autonomous aerial refueling and airlift capabilities with The War Zone and other members of the media at a roundtable on the sidelines of the main annual Air & Space Forces Association conference yesterday. TRANSCOM serves as a centralized U.S. military-wide manager for logistical support in the air, as well as on the ground and at sea. 'So we're actually in a &#8230; Cooperative Research and Development Agreement [CRADA] on autonomous KC-135,' Van Ovost said. 'So we are looking at that.' US Air Force KC-135 tankers. USAF CRADAs provide the U.S. military with a mechanism to partner with industry, academia, and other organizations on projects outside of normal contracting processes and they typically involve an exchange of resources and data in lieu of traditional payment. Autonomous flight technology company Merlin has been leading the work relating to the KC-135 in cooperation with the Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC), a major aerospace firm that specializes in aircraft modification, and the U.S. Air Force's Air Mobility Command (AMC) and Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC). AMC oversees the vast majority of the service's tankers and airlifters. Merlin's efforts with regard to the KC-135 have been focused first on ways autonomous capabilities can help reduce the workload for aircrews. 'Starting [on] July 22, Merlin and SNC were granted a temporary military flight release by the United States Air Force (USAF). The team conducted real-time data collection and analysis to inform the Merlin Pilot‚Äôs integration design and flight control tuning for military aircraft,' according to a press release from Merlin in August. 'The flights support an ongoing agreement with Air Mobility Command (AMC) and Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) to design, integrate, test, and demonstrate aspects of the Merlin Pilot on the KC-135. Merlin engineers also joined USAF pilots on data collection flights at MacDill Air Force Base in May 2024.' 'The flights helped the team better understand crew workload drivers for military use cases,' Merlin's August release added. 'Together, these milestones signify Merlin‚Äôs progressive system design and integration work to achieve its goal of an in-flight demonstration of the Merlin Pilot in the next year.' Autonomous capabilities that can be integrated into existing Air Force KC-135s and other tankers could also support other ongoing initiatives. In speaking yesterday, Gen. Van Ovost highlighted AMC's experimentation with aerial refuelers, as well as airlifters, flown by skeleton crews. The Air Force has presented this as a potential way to help increase sortie rates and overall operational capacity, especially in a potential future high-end conflict, such as one in the Pacific against China. Flight safety and other questions have been raised about these plans, as you can read about in more detail here. What Merlin, SNC, and the Air Force are working on now could help provide extra margins of safety to AMC aircrews in general. Greater autonomy or even pilot-optional capabilities could just help breathe new life into the Air Force's aging KC-135s, as well as feed into future aerial refueling developments. The service is currently in the process of refining core requirements for its Next Generation Air-refueling System (NGAS), which is expected to be a multi-layered 'system of systems.' A rendering of a notional next-generation stealth tanker, something that could be part of the future NGAS family of systems. Lockheed Martin Skunk Works via Aviation Week 'There's the Analysis of Alternatives for the NGAS &#8230; that's coming out here at the end of this year. It's been&#8230; almost two years of work &#8230; and the initial insights are not surprising,' Gen. Van Ovost said at yesterday's roundtable. 'How do you fly into a contested environment? How do you shrink the visibility of your airplane, right? How much does it have to carry?' Van Ovost also highlighted questions about how NGAS platforms might refuel crewed and uncrewed aircraft, and do so in instances where the tanker and/or the receiver are operating autonomously to some degree. Crewed stealth tankers, as well as uncrewed aerial refuelers and new podded 'buddy store' refueling systems with collapsible or retractable booms, have already been discussed as potential components of NGAS. The initiative is now directly tied to other major modernization efforts, including the fate of plans for a new crewed sixth-generation stealth combat jet, as you can learn more about here. 'Frankly, I think in air fueling, that's the place I would go to first [to integrate more autonomy], because we're already seeing some capabilities for autonomous boom engagements,' the head of TRANSCOM added. Both Boeing in the United States and Airbus in Europe have been actively working on and demonstrating capabilities to increasingly automate the process of boom-equipped tankers linking up receivers, including uncrewed ones. The boom method remains the Air Force's preferred way of getting gas into aircraft in flight, though it does have probe-and-drogue tankers primarily for refueling helicopters and V-22 Ospreys. The probe-and-drogue method is also predominant in the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps, as well as many other countries around the world. In addition to autonomous aerial refueling capabilities, Van Ovost talked about interest in autonomous airlifters, which the Air Force has also been experimenting with in recent years, at yesterday's roundtable. She did highlight additional complexities that come along with uncrewed aerial logistics platforms, especially when it comes to moving personnel, that aren't necessarily considerations when talking about pilotless tankers. 'If I have an autonomous capability that's doing that last tactical mile, and it goes to an airfield or a road, how does it autonomously offload, turn around, and fly back?' she asked rhetorically. 'So we are looking at what technologies that [it] would&#8230; take to do that, what will be the concept of operations. &#8230; could you launch it out of C-17? Would it then recover at a known airfield somewhere, in Australia or whatever? So we're looking at all of that and that certainly is on the table.' Van Ovost's mention of Australia underscores significant discussions ongoing now about what kind of new and novel logistics chains will be required to sustain future operations in a high-end Pacific fight where U.S. forces will be dispersed across broad areas many of which will be separated by large expanses of water. Distributed hub-and-spoke air mobility concepts incorporating cargo and potentially personnel-carrying drones, which would also be more employable in higher-risk environments, could be key elements of that equation in the future. China is looking at the same realities for future operations and, while the U.S. Air Force has been experimenting with uncrewed airlifters, there has been a much more substantial explosion in developments in this realm from Chinese aviation firms recently. Just this year, Chinese drone maker Tengden and the country's state-run Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) announced the first flights of two new uncrewed cargo-carrying aircraft. Tengden's new design has a stated payload capacity of around 4,410 pounds (2,000 kilograms), larger than anything similar the U.S. Air Force has tested to date, at least publicly. Gen. Van Ovost has made clear that the U.S. Air Force and TRANSCOM remain very interested in autonomous aerial refueling, airlift, and other logistics capabilities. At the same time, U.S. developments in this regard still look to be in their infancy, despite how essential they could be in future conflicts.

Massive Russian Weapons Depot Still Burning After Ukrainian Drone...	A huge explosion has rocked the Tver region, in the west of Russia, after Ukrainian long-range attack drones targeted a sprawling ammunition depot there. Videos and pictures on social media from the scene show an initial explosion, with a very large fireball, followed by a significant visible shockwave, further explosions in the vicinity, and then several minutes‚Äô worth of secondary explosions illuminating the night sky. Fires were still burning the day after the attacks. /2.

Dmitry Bulgakov, the then deputy minister of defense, the facility met 'the highest international standards.' 'The arsenal in Toropets allows us to shelter reserves of missiles and ammunition from external influences and ensure their safety and fire and explosion safety,' Bulgakov said at the time. The site covers an area of around two square miles, with an outside perimeter of roughly seven miles.

While this hasn‚Äôt been independently verified, North Korean short-range ballistic missiles have been used by Russia since at least December 30, 2023. Although they make up only a very small fraction of the weapons used in Russian strikes on Ukraine, there has long been concern about the burgeoning military relationship between Moscow and Pyongyang. Kyrylo Budanov, Ukraine‚Äôs military intelligence chief, recently placed North Korea at the top of the list of countries that provided the most military support to Russia, saying that 'North Korea would be first, then there is no one for a long time, and then everyone else.'

Photo by Denys Glushko /Gwara Media/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images Global Images Ukraine According to Russian reports, Toropets has been previously attacked, in May and June of this year. With Kyiv‚Äôs Western partners still refusing to allow the use of long-range weapons they have supplied to hit targets deep inside Russia, Ukraine has continued to make use of domestically produced one-way attack drones instead. The developing capabilities of its one-way attack drones have allowed Ukraine to strike targets at distances of more than 1,000 miles in the past. While long-range Ukrainian attacks against targets within Russian borders have had an important morale-boosting role, the campaign of drone strikes has increasingly concentrated on key energy infrastructure and military targets. With that in mind, the apparent level of destruction in Toropets should also have a positive impact for Ukraine both on the battlefield and as it seeks to defend itself against Russian long-range strikes.

Skunk Works‚Äô Losing Loyal Wingman Drone Was Very Stealthy 'Gold P...	Lockheed Martin's losing entry in the first increment of the U.S. Air Force's Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drone program was a very stealthy design, the head of the famed Skunk Works advanced projects division has disclosed. The company is now expecting future CCA increments to revolve around proposals that might lean closer to not just being lower-cost, but maybe even expendable, to support a concept of operations that requires tolerance for very high losses. All of this speaks to broader questions about how the Air Force is balancing capabilities and cost with regard to CCAs, which the service sees as critical to winning future conflicts, especially high-end fights against near-peer competitors like China. John Clark, Lockheed Martin Vice President and General Manager of Advanced Development Programs (ADP), better known as Skunk Works, spoke to The War Zone and others about CCAs and other developments at the Air & Space Forces Association's main annual conference today. In April, the Air Force announced that it had picked General Atomics and Anduril to proceed in the CCA program's Increment One. The service is still in the process of refining its requirements for a second of what is expected to be multiple subsequent increments. The expectation currently is that CCAs of any kind will work very closely together with crewed combat aircraft and under the direct supervision of human operators. A model of Anduril's Fury drone, which it is now developing under the CCA Program's Increment One. Jamie Hunter 'Our Increment One offering had higher levels of stealth than were necessary in the requirements because of the operational analysis conviction of building something that actually had value to the Air Force over the long haul,' Clark said. 'I think, hindsight 20/20, we could certainly armchair quarterback and say, well the Air Force isn't valuing survivability right now, so we gold-plated something they didn't need gold-plated.' Clark did not mention it explicitly, but in 2022, Skunk Works had publicly laid out a future crewed-uncrewed teaming vision that included multiple tiers of drones, including a very low-observable (stealthy) type, as you can read more about here. The designs that General Atomics and Anduril are working on right now both have stealthy characteristics, but neither one has a very high level of broadband low-observability (stealthiness) like one might find on something like Northrop Grumman's B-21 Raider stealth bomber. The War Zone just explored these trade-offs in a story about how the U.S. military is continuing to pass over more exquisite, very stealthy, and highly autonomous uncrewed combat air vehicles (UCAV) in favor of pursuing lower-tier CCAs. This is despite China and others actively pursuing stealthy flying wing UCAVs. 'You can go look at what's represented in GA's [General Atomics] booth or the AFRL [Air Force Research Laboratory] booth. What you see is that they try to take all the [radar signal] energy &#8230; [and] as it comes nose on it splashes around,' Clark added. 'But if you look there's these tails on the side that are big reflectors that all that energy hits the side of the tail and comes right back.' General Atomics and Anduril brought models of their respective CCAs to display at the AFA convention. General Atomics' XQ-67 Off-Board Sensing Station (OBSS) drone, which it developed for AFRL and from which its CCA design is partially derived, is also on the show floor. A model of General Atomics' CCA design. Jamie Hunter 'The way it reaches its survivability is modest stealth with a lot of interoperability with other Department of Defense systems,' Michael Atwood, VP of Advanced Programs for General Atomics, told The War Zone about his company's CCA in a separate interview from the show floor that you can find here. Skunk Works' Clark did acknowledge other ways to achieve survivability beyond stealthy design features. However, he argued that things like electronic warfare jammers and other countermeasures are complementary rather than substitutes for higher degrees of stealth. 'Do you want to put your asset at risk? Do you want to put your crew at risk on the premise of the countermeasure alone? Or do you want to have a very solid foundation that allows you to get closer and interoperate, or have that freedom of maneuver, and then if something happens to go bad, I can employ the countermeasure as an evasive tactic?,' Clark asked rhetorically. 'I'm going to drive in on the adversary. And what happens if that [AN/]ALQ-99 just happens to stop working right when I go into the adversary area? The jammer is no longer working and I've now put myself in dire straits. There's no escaping that.' 'So that's philosophically the way that we look at it is it putting countermeasures together on top of stealth [is] very good,' he continued. 'Not having that basic foundation that we begin with puts yourself in a very risky situation that if it works, great. [But] none of that stuff works 100 percent of the time.' A rendering showing an F-35 flying together with various types of drones, including a very stealthy flying wing design at top center, that Skunk Works has released in the past. Lockheed Martin Skunk Works All of this is impacting how Lockheed Martin plans to approach the second increment of the CCA program and its beliefs about what the Air Force is likely to be looking for in that next phase. 'So with Increment Two, I think that right now we're actively looking at how the Air Force is going to go with their requirements. I think that what we see from a macro level&#8230; environment, is that something &#8230; that has more expendable characteristics and is at a much, much lower cost point,' Clark said. That 'seems to be a good place to go explore. And so that's where we're exploring and putting time and energy in is in that trade space, because ultimately, from a buying power perspective, you've got to find something that's actually executing the mission, but not costing the national treasury on the first day of the war when you lose most of your aircraft.' Clark stressed that this was Lockheed Martin's view based on the information it has in hand and not on the actual Increment Two CCA requirements, which the Air Force says it has not finalized. It is interesting to note here that the U.S. Navy has presented a vision for its CCA program, which is separate, but heavily intertwined with the Air Force effort, wherein drones might be 'expended' as munitions or targets when they reach the end of what could be very short service lives. At least for Increment One CCAs, the Air Force has been targeting a unit cost of roughly a quarter to a third of the price of an F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. F-35 prices differ based on variant and fluctuate regularly, but publicly available data puts the CCA price range between around $20.5 and $27.5 million. As The War Zone has reported in the past, what is known about the Increment One requirements has pointed to higher performance designs with price points at the very high end of the project cost range. The Air Force is aiming for Increment One CCAs, at least, to cost between one-quarter and one-third of the price of F-35 stealth fighters like the A models seen here. USAF 'I think that there will &#8230; be a reckoning to come at some point when [the Air Force is] looking at [a scenario where] &#8230; I'm going to spend $15 million or $20 million an airplane, and the OA [operational analysis] is telling me that 80 percent or more of them don't make it home,' Clark said. 'How many airplanes am I willing to spend that sort of money on before that's a losing proposition financially as a nation.' 'That's a question that I'm very interested in how the Air Force will ultimately choose to go down that path,' he continued. 'What is the right place from an expendable asset [perspective] and what's the right place from an attritable [one], and where do you want to have something that comes home every time? And I think that's part of what the Air Force is looking to go experiment with and learn more about &#8230; but that's something that, given our OA, we already have some strong convictions about what we think is necessary.' These are certainly questions the Air Force will need to answer and the service has already made clear that what it will want from CCA Increment Two could be dramatically different from the Increment One requirements. 'So what should Increment 2 be? Do not assume and it may not be just an evolution of Increment 1. It could be an entirely different set of missions. Could be [an] entirely different kind of an aircraft,' Andrew Hunter, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology & Logistics, said at the 2024 Defense News Conference earlier this month. 'And so part of that initial work is, again, starting with a large vendor pool, what are the good ideas out there? We‚Äôll have some ideas [about] what we think Increment 2 needs to do as part of a broader force, and that‚Äôs part of this broader look at air dominance and how we‚Äôre going to deliver that.' The Air Force is also expecting to face broader budgetary pressures in the coming years, a reality that has already helped prompt a top-to-bottom review of plans to acquire a new crewed sixth-generation stealth combat jet. That aircraft and the CCA drones are part of the service's larger Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) modernization effort. The future of the NGAD combat jet, as well as the CCA Increment Two requirements, are also now further tied to other ongoing deliberations about stealth tankers and other future aerial refueling capabilities, as you can read more about here. A rendering of a notional crewed sixth-generation stealth combat jet flying together with a trio of CCA-like drones. Collins Aerospace A rendering of a notional sixth-generation crewed combat jet flying together with a trio of drones. Collins Aerospace Regardless, it is now clear that Skunk Works passionately believed a more advanced and survivable design was the outright critical route for the Air Force's CCA needs, a gamble that ended up in a loss on Increment One, but things could change if the service learns that its cheaper and simpler designs outright lack combat effectiveness and general survivability.

Link 16 Coverage From Space, Laser Communications Relays Make Maj...	The U.S. Space Development Agency, or SDA has outlined the progress made so far in demonstrating a satellite-based Link 16 system to transmit data directly from space, the potential of laser communications to connect satellites together in a mesh network and back to earth, as well as developments in using those same satellites to conduct missile tracking from low Earth orbit (LEO). All could have significant implications for future conflicts. The updates were provided by SDA director Derek M. Tournear, speaking at the Air & Space Forces Association‚Äôs (AFA) main annual conference just outside Washington, D.C. yesterday. Derek M Tournear, Space Development Agency director. U.S. Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Raisa Christie U.S. Air Force Airman 1st Class Raisa Christie To explore the potential of Link 16 in space, SDA is using satellites from York Space Systems, with the first data sent via this system in November of last year. The initial space-to-ground Link 16 connection was from LEO and involved three of York‚Äôs T0 Transport Layer satellites and what the SDA described as 'a series of receivers using terrestrial radios during three demonstrations held November 21-27, 2023.' 'Operators working with SDA conducted both passive and active network entry, obtained fine synchronization, and transmitted multiple tactical messages from satellites using L-band radios aboard Tranche 0 (T0) Transport Layer satellites to a ground test site located within the territory of a Five Eyes partner nation,' the agency announced in a media release at the time. The Five Eyes partners are Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States, which share a broad range of intelligence with one another. Another set of data-transport satellites, built by Lockheed Martin and launched in September 2023, are also now serving the Link 16 trials. In all, the SDA‚Äôs initial Tranche 0 constellation comprises 28 satellites ‚Äî 19 transport and eight tracking satellites in LEO, plus one ground-based testbed satellite. Link 16 is a NATO-standard tactical datalink communication system and one that‚Äôs central to U.S. and allied military operations, allowing coalition forces to seamlessly transmit and exchange real-time situational awareness data. A U.S. Marine Corps radio operator uses the AN/PRC-117 Multiband Manpack Radio to set up communication during exercise Steel Knight at Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms, California, Dec. 5, 2019. U.S. Marine Corps photo by Cpl. Alexa M. Hernandez Cpl. Alexa Hernandez Link 16 is also a fundamental component of America‚Äôs expanding Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) initiative, which aims to allow commanders to share data and create a 'common operating picture' for real-time intelligence and automate fire control. Using satellites to support Link 16 connectivity offers various benefits, including the potential to provide a more robust link between sensors and shooters wherever they may be. While traditional Link 16 radios have a line-of-sight range of around 200 to 300 nautical miles, putting relay systems in space has the huge advantage of providing beyond-line-of-sight communications around the globe in near-real-time. Already, providing an active Link 16 network across a region via an aircraft gateway brings significant advantages and a space-based capability should provide this same capability on a much wider and more persistent level. So far, Tournear says, the results of putting Link 16 in space have been impressive. 'Essentially, 100 percent of our links work every time we go in,' Tournear said in his briefing yesterday. 'When someone's prepared to listen to us, we transmit, receive, and that works. We‚Äôve demonstrated that to a lot of different platforms, including aircraft with the Navy and down to aircraft carriers at sea. All that works perfectly.' In the Tranche 0 configuration, satellites can maintain Link 16 contact for around 10 minutes at a time, which Tournear said is 'working exceptionally well.' However, for Tranche 1, it will be possible to maintain contact longer with each satellite. More importantly, Tranche 1 will eventually involve more than 100 satellites. 'Essentially, any time you‚Äôre on the globe, you‚Äôll be able to look up and have at least one, if not two to four, Link 16 satellites overhead at any given time. So you‚Äôll have that assured connectivity with that network,' Tournear said. Meanwhile, for the laser communication experiments, the SDA is using a pair of missile-tracking satellites built by SpaceX and launched in April 2023. The video below from the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) offers a good overview of the benefits of laser-based communications systems. The idea behind the laser communications tests is to have satellites that can ‚Äòtalk to‚Äô one another as well as to communicate with ground stations, ships and aircraft via laser, ensuring data can be moved around the globe quickly and more securely than past communications methods. The advantages of using lasers for this include the ability to rapidly transmit higher volumes of data as well as making it much harder for a potential adversary to intercept or jam those communications. Initially, SDA demonstrated that it was possible to maintain laser communications links 'for a couple of hours at a time,' but now the satellites are 'able to maintain link essentially longer than 24 hours at a time,' Tournear said. 'They drop link maybe once every other day, and it takes them, you know, under 100 seconds to regain that link again. That‚Äôs essentially where we need it to be for an operational system.' As well as communications between satellites, Tournear said that the Tranche 1 version of the laser system would extend communications to assets on the ground and to airborne systems. Tournear also said that one of the next steps will be to demonstrate the transfer of data between the York satellites using the mesh network, the concept used in SpaceX‚Äôs Starlink commercial satellite constellation. After that, he said he wanted to show that crosslinks could also be set up between the York and SpaceX satellites. As regards using satellites to create a missile tracking layer, Tournear confirmed that the SDA has demonstrated the detection of 'a lot of targeted opportunities, including some small, short-range ballistic missile launches ‚Äî we‚Äôve been able to detect and track them, as well as larger launches and even the Starship reentry, things like that. That‚Äôs all going exceptionally well.' Bearing in mind the extensive use of ballistic missiles in Ukraine and, more recently in the latest Gaza war, the option to call upon satellites for missile tracking is an especially interesting one, as Tournear observed: 'If you just look at a lot of the missiles that are being utilized in the Russia‚ÄìUkraine conflict, those are starting to get into what we have always euphemistically referred to as ‚Äòadvanced missile threats.‚Äô Especially when you start to get to a lot of those, and I‚Äôll talk about the April 13 event when Iran attacked Israel, when you start to get many, many volleys and missiles that are short-range ballistic in nature, that‚Äôs where you really see the advantage of this proliferated low Earth orbit tracking constellation.' In the future, the combination of missile-tracking SDA satellites and new communications networks will mean that data on missile activities will be distributed to theater commanders much quicker than has traditionally been the case. An Iskander short-range ballistic missile, a type that has been heavily utilized by Russia in its war in Ukraine. Russian Ministry of Defense Russian Ministry of Defense The next phase of all this work will involve yet more satellites, under Tranche 1 of the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA), which will seek to make operational the communications capabilities tested so far. Contracts for Tranche 1 were awarded in February 2022 and called for satellites to be ready to launch by September 2024. This schedule has now shifted, with Tournear now stating that the satellites will be launched in 2025. Tranche 1 will be a significant effort, involving six launches that will put 128 data transport satellites into orbit, four to send up 35 missile warning/tracking satellites, and one launch to deliver 12 demonstration and experimentation satellites. Previously, plans called for a launch rate of around one launch every two months, leading to an initial operational capability for PWSA by the summer of 2025, but this schedule may well now have slipped. While PWSA promises to bring powerful new communications capabilities for U.S. and allied warfighters, this kind of technology doesn‚Äôt come cheap and is arriving at a time in which U.S. defense budgets are under strain. In the past, Tournear has said that he‚Äôs confident that it will be possible to drive down the costs of a single data transport satellite to around $15 million. It‚Äôs hoped that the potential benefits offered by the commercial sector will mitigate the challenges of inflation and traditional supply chains, but that remains to be seen. After all, Tournear has also admitted that, while the costs of the satellites themselves should drop as the market grows, adding new capabilities will push the prices back up. The importance of PWSA shouldn‚Äôt be underestimated, with the SDA describing it as nothing less than 'the backbone of JADC2 in space.' Once up and running, the delivery of tactical messages, including beyond-line-of-sight scenarios, will be achieved not only by platforms within the atmosphere but also by a network of Link 16 systems aboard multiple space vehicles. As well as the addition to the communications node, SDA is also moving ever closer toward a new constellation of satellites that will also be able to communicate with each other much more reliably than was previously the case, and also bring their sensors to bear on ballistic missile threats, helping to keep tabs on a critical proliferating threat. Overall, the SDA‚Äôs emerging architectures focused on constellations of many satellites instead of a handful of larger, more expensive ones should make the entire space-based system far more resilient to enemy attack ‚Äî and capable ‚Äî than in the past.

General Atomics, which is one of two finalists for the first increment of the USAF‚Äôs high-stakes Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) program gave The War Zone a close look at their design, as well as the closely related XQ-67A Off-Board Sensing Station (OBSS) drone. The company brought the CCA model and the actual XQ-67A OBSS to the show floor at the Air & Space Force Association‚Äôs annual Air, Space, Cyber convention just outside of Washington, D.C. General Atomics' CCA design is derived from the XQ-67 and reflects work the company has done and continues to explore on concepts revolving around the use of a core chassis onto which very different airframes ‚Äî from those optimized for loitering near contested territory for long periods of time to much higher performance, transonic, fighter-like configurations ‚Äî can be installed. OBSS has already played as something of a partial proof of concept for the common chassis idea. General Atomics is also developing a full family of drones, called Gambit, around this concept, each with the same chassis that includes landing gear and critical mission and flight control computer systems. You can read more about the company's CCA design, the XQ-67, and Gambit here. Michael Atwood, VP of advanced programs for General Atomics, gave us a great overview of both aircraft designs, and mentioned some interesting things, including how apparently their CCA is designed to be able to operate from rough fields. He also described exactly how General Atomics is positioning its increment one CCA contender in terms of balancing cost and capability, stating: 'General Atomics believes in balanced survivability. Which is while this plane may have some stealth features, we rely on a variety of methods, from the seafloor to space, to augment the capability. So really what you can see this as is kind of a weapons truck. It can bring all sorts of different types of weapons in different configurations, but the way it reaches its survivability is modest stealth with a lot of interoperability with other Department of Defense systems‚Ä¶ Attritability has been a hard number for us to figure out. XQ-67 allowed us to find relative cost points where we could bring this aircraft to bear. You can think of some of these airplanes being match sticks, you can think of some of them being Zippo lighters that you refill and use all the time. We tried to make this be the Bic lighter ‚Äî the thing that you‚Äôre going to depend on, that you are going to take on your camping trip that‚Äôs going to work. but after you have used its useful life, you throw away and don‚Äôt have this huge O and S (operating and support) cost.'

Hezbollah‚Äôs Exploding Pagers Could Be As Monumental A Cyber-Espio...	In an extraordinary development in the Middle East conflict, thousands of Hezbollah members have been injured and at least three people were killed after pagers that the militants used exploded simultaneously today. While exactly how this occurred remains unclear, it could very well be a monumental cyber attack that could have widespread implications far beyond the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. Regardless, it should be a wake-up call. While no one has so far taken responsibility, Hezbollah has blamed Israel for the attack. A source from the group said that they expect the attack may have been launched in response to an alleged assassination attempt by the Lebanese militant group on a former senior Israeli security official. The existence of that plot was only revealed today by Israel‚Äôs Shin Bet security agency.

Hezbollah has confirmed the deaths of at least three people, including two of its fighters. At the time of writing, at least nine people have died and approximately 2,800 have been wounded, according to Lebanon‚Äôs Minister of Health Firas Abiad. Of the injured, 170 at least are also said to be in critical condition.

Photo by Anwar AMRO / AFP ANWAR AMRO The incidents have led to alarm among Hezbollah, with one official from the group telling Reuters that the pager explosions represented the 'biggest security breach' they had faced since the start of the current Gaza war. Security considerations mean that Hezbollah is responsible for its own discrete communication network and there have been previous concerns that Israel may have managed to penetrate its telecommunications. This speculation, though unconfirmed, has been fueled since October by the assassination of several Hezbollah commanders, with targeting coordinates having been generated for locations that were otherwise considered safe. Lebanon, and specifically Beirut, has been in Israel‚Äôs sights since Hezbollah began a campaign of rocket and drone strikes against Israel almost a year ago, in solidarity with Hamas, after that group launched its surprise invasion on October 7, 2023, starting the current conflict in Gaza. Smoke billows after rockets were fired from southern Lebanon over the Upper Galilee region in northern Israel on September 11, 2024. Photo by Jalaa MAREY / AFP JALAA MAREY Tensions between Israel and Hezbollah have increased dramatically in recent months, stoking fears of a large-scale conflict breaking out between them. One key factor in the standoff is Israel‚Äôs stated plan to return tens of thousands of Israelis who had been evacuated from towns along the northern border with Lebanon when Hezbollah stepped up its campaign of rocket attacks. With the return of these evacuees now approved by Israeli officials, there have been suggestions that a major military operation may be about to be launched against the militant group. As well as the evacuations, the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah has so far resulted in hundreds of deaths, most of them from the Lebanese militant group, as well as Israeli civilians and soldiers. The prospect of a large-scale offensive against Hezbollah isn‚Äôt universally supported by Israeli officials. This has led to reports that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could be poised to remove Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant from his post since he is said to oppose such an operation. In the meantime, Lebanon deals with the bloody aftermath of today‚Äôs pager explosions. Hezbollah's pagers were jammed by Israel and caused their batteries to explode in different parts of Lebanon.Here's two examples. pic.twitter.com/iCjEyoxR7d&mdash; Clash Report (@clashreport) September 17, 2024 Speculation is already growing as to how Israel might have carried out the campaign. There have been reports, including from three different security sources, that the targeted pagers were from a recent shipment to arrive in Lebanon. If true, that could suggest that they had some kind of malware implanted in them and an explosive charge. This would have required Israel to intercept and alter or swap out the shipments of these pagers, which would be a complex affair, but not one outside of the realm of feasibility. WSJ: exploding pagers were from a new shipment that arrived recently, were carried by hundreds of Hezbollah members; Hezbollah official speculates malware caused the devices to overheat and explode; some members felt pagers getting hot and disposed of them&mdash; Aleph ◊ê (@no_itsmyturn) September 17, 2024 Another possibility is that the lithium batteries in the pagers were triggered into an overheating mode, turning them into improvised explosive devices. The potential for commercial lithium batteries to explode is something that we have touched upon in a previous report. In such a way, it may have been possible for Israel to remotely trigger a ‚Äòthermal runaway,‚Äô in which a power source either bursts into flames or explodes. It's also possible that a combination of the two, insertion of malware or alterations physically to the devices and using cyber warfare to exploit that structured vulnerability at an opportune time could also be at play here. 'Exclusive sources for Sky News Arabia: Mossad placed a quantity of highly explosive PETN on the devices‚Äô battery and detonated it by raising the battery‚Äôs temperature.' Evergreen Intel (@vcdgf555) September 17, 2024 In a similar manner how the deployment of the Stuxnet malicious software worm ‚Äî which Israel played a direct role in ‚Äî against Iran's nuclear program two decades ago was a revelation that highlighted the new realities of cyber warfare, this event could end up having a similar effect. Turning everyday electronics that include wireless connectivity into improvised explosive devices may seem like dystopian science fiction, but it really isn't that far-fetched. Considering everyone reading this likely has just such a device in their pocket or hand, and considering the potential vulnerabilities of hardware created overseas, often by possible future adversaries, as well as the software that controls these devices, the alarm bells couldn't ring any louder, even if this event proves to be something else. We interact every day with examples of networked technology ‚Äî from the cars we drive to the computer hardware we use to make a living ‚Äî that also have power packs with large amounts of stored potential energy. So targeting such devices for nefarious kinetic purposes is darkly logical. When you think about it in that light, the explosive/incendiary charges are already distributed all over the globe by the billions. The possible ability to connect to and trigger those charges is, at least in theory, already built in. Now targeting the right devices and making them actually ignite is another thing, but for some devices, that could be more of a software challenge above anything else. Being able to remotely target individuals via their unique device, which has their electronic fingerprint attached to it, is also an unprecedented concept to comprehend. A potential kinetic attack opportunity like this has never existed in human history and even an adversary just lighting as many batteries on fire in a target country could cause massive and widespread damage and a near halt to productivity. This is just one of myriad potential cyber attack vectors that could cripple an entire society. On the other hand, if Israel meddled with the pager hardware directly and this wasn't just a pure cyber operation, that also points to the potential vulnerabilities in hardware supply channels, which have already been a constant issue of contention. This is a developing story and we will bring more details as they emerge.

No Flying Wing UCAVs Being Developed By U.S. Air Force While Chin...	The U.S. Air Force has no plans to acquire stealthy uncrewed combat air vehicles (UCAV) capable of operating with very high degrees of autonomy independently of crewed aircraft. The service is instead focused on buying large numbers of Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones that it plans to employ tightly tethered to piloted aircraft. This is in spite of the potential value of fully autonomous UCAVs, especially in a potential high-end end fight across the broad expanses of the Pacific against China, which is investing heavily in drones of this kind. The War Zone has been keeping a close eye on the still-widening UCAV gap between the U.S. military and its Chinese counterparts for years now. For a time, stealthy flying wing UCAVs looked on track to become a revolutionary new capability for America's armed forces before suddenly disappearing completely from the public eye in the United States without any real explanation more than a decade ago, as you can read more about in this past feature. Our own Howard Altman took the opportunity to ask Gen. David Allvin, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, about the issue yesterday at a roundtable for members of the media on the sidelines of the Air & Space Forces Association's (AFA) main annual conference outside of Washington, D.C. A look at the underside of a Boeing X-45A UCAV demonstrator with one of its internal payload bays open during a flight test in the early 2000s. The X-45A is one of a number of UCAV designs the US Air Force has experimented with in the past. USAF 'I would say that our conception for the Collaborative Combat Aircraft &#8230; it's part of the human-machine teaming,' Allvin said. 'What we think is the most value for the types of fights that the Air Force is going to be expected to participate with a joint force in is in this affordable mass, in this first increment of Collaborative Combat Aircraft, following on with some combination to be able to do either collective or disaggregated air superiority.' 'If there's a mission that we think is best served by something like that [a flying wing-type UCAV], we'll certainly look at investing in it,' he continued. 'But our focus right now is in these Collaborative Combat Aircraft to do the human-machine team.' The U.S. Air Force had been very active in the development of flying wing UCAVs, and publicly so, in cooperation with the U.S. Navy, around the turn of the last century. However, by the early 2010s, the Air Force's interest in such capabilities, at least in the unclassified domain, had completely evaporated. The Navy pushed ahead alone for a short time before it too abandoned its UCAV efforts. As already noted, this was a still very curious series of events. 'So, to do something that is independent of that [human-machine teaming], we have some capabilities,' Gen. Allvin did add, which might allude to ongoing work on some level in the classified realm or at least some degree of preservation of work from previous programs. The Air Force has continued to develop and field stealth flying wing drones configured for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions over the years. This includes Lockheed Martin's RQ-170 Sentinel and Northrop Grumman design commonly referred to as the RQ-180. A notional rendering of the Northrop Grumman drone commonly referred to as the RQ-180. Hangar B Productions Allvin's comments are very much in line with those from other senior Air Force officials when it comes to plans for future uncrewed combat aviation capabilities. As it stands now, the service has laid out a vision of operating large numbers of less complex and lower-cost CCAs in a completely different category from flying wing UCAVs, which will be very directly overseen by a controller in another aircraft. General Atomics and Anduril are currently working on two separate designs as part of the CCA program's initial iterative development cycle, which is expected to be the first of many such 'increments.' 'As we go forward, I expect there'll be a strike aspect to CCAs, as well, but initially we're focused on air superiority and how to use the CCAs in conjunction with a crewed aircraft to achieve air superiority,' Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall said at a separate media roundtable The War Zone and other outlets attended on the sidelines of the AFA conference yesterday. 'When we do the ops analysis, there's a really clear advantage of that.' A model of Anduril's Fury drone, which the company is now developing as part of the CCA program's Increment 1, on the show floor at this year's main annual AFA conference. Jamie Hunter 'I was just talking to our program manager downstairs&#8230; and we were talking about what we think the number of aircraft, CCAs, that can be controlled by a crewed aircraft [is]. And I initially started out with a range of three to five,' Kendall continued. 'We're talking about bigger numbers than that now. So we're moving towards greater reliance on uncrewed aircraft working with crewed platforms to achieve air superiority and to do other missions.' 'One of the things you have to have if you're going to use CCAs and have them be armed and &#8230; Lethal is that they have to be under tight control. And, for me, one of the elements of that needs to be line-of-sight communications. And I think that that's an important thing to have in the mix, secure, reliable line-of-sight communications. We're not going to have aircraft going out and doing engagements uncontrolled,' the Air Force's top civilian added. 'So the default, if they lose communications, would be for them to return to base, which takes them out of the fight. So we don't want that to happen. And when they do do engagements, &#8230; we want them under tight control. So I think the mix of crewed and uncrewed aircraft, I think, is going to be the right answer for the foreseeable future.' Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall (at left) and Chief of Staff of the Air Force Gen. David Allvin (at right) sign a model of General Atomics' CCA design on the show floor at this year's main AFA conference. GA-ASI Kendall also suggested that more narrowly focusing the design of a planned crewed sixth-generation stealth combat jet around the drone controller mission might offer a path to dramatically reduce the unit cost of those aircraft. He has left the door open in the past to the potential for this aircraft, which is part of the larger Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative, to be pilot-optional or even entirely uncrewed in the end but has also said a crewed design of some kind is still likely to emerge. The NGAD combat jet program is currently on hold while a complete reassessment of the underlying requirements is conducted, as you can read more about here. 'The F-35 kind of represents, to me, the upper bounds of what we'd like to pay for an individual [NGAD combat jet] aircraft,' the Secretary of the Air Force said yesterday. 'I'd like to go lower though &#8230; once you start integrating CCAs and transferring some mission equipment and capabilities [and] functions to the CCAs, then you can talk about a different concept, potentially, for the crewed fighter that's controlling them.' The original NGAD combat jet concept that is now under review has been expected to have a unit cost roughly three times that of an F-35. Kendall said that the Air Force could still pursue a design like that if the ongoing reassessment determines that to be the best course of action. The average unit price of an F-35 differs by variant and fluctuates regularly, but is generally pegged at between $80 and $90 million based on publicly available information. 'We are maturing our approach to autonomy so it's getting better,' Andrew Hunter, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology & Logistics, told The War Zone and other outlets at his own roundtable at the AFA conference yesterday. 'So it's not going to be static.' A rendering of a notional crewed sixth-generation stealth combat jet flying together with a trio of CCA-type drones. Collins Aerospace A rendering of a notional sixth-generation crewed combat jet flying together with a trio of drones. Collins Aerospace At the same time, 'we know two things about autonomy,' Hunter explained. 'One is laws of war require us to have, you know, human engagement in key decisions involving employment of weapons and other key decisions. So we have to have that. We have to have that human engagement, the ability to do that. The second is [that] we know that our ability to create systems that can operate autonomously and do missions well is something that is still maturing.' The Air Force's future vision of CCAs operating under the tight control of human operators in other nearby aircraft stands in stark contrast to a steady stream of UCAV developments, especially with regard to stealth flying wing types, in China in recent years. There is growing evidence that testing of one particular design, the GJ-11 Sharp Sword, is now significantly expanding in scale and scope. Work to date on the GJ-11 has already pointed to plans to operate the UCAVs in highly autonomous cooperative swarms, as well as teamed with crewed combat jets. Shipboard operations from aircraft carriers and big deck amphibious assault ships also increasingly look to be in the Sharp Sword's future.

Malan, situated in China‚Äôs far-western Xinjiang province, is a major drone testing hub. The War Zone recently reported on these and other Chinese UCAV developments in more detail, as you can find here. An annotated satellite image showing a pair of GJ-11 Sharp Sward UCAVs at China's Malan Air Base in July 2024. PHOTO ¬© 2024 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION After we published that story it also came to our attention that other satellite images had caught a GJ-11, along with other military drones, at China's Daocheng Yading Airport. Located in the Garze Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of China's Sichuan province at an altitude of approximately 14,472 feet, Daocheng Yading is the highest civilian airport in the world. It is also less than 250 miles from the border with India, one of China's chief regional competitors. The dichotomy is even more striking considering the U.S. military currently uses its Chinese counterparts as its chief 'pacing threat' to plan against. More exquisite autonomous stealthy UCAVs would be more expensive and complex than the CCAs that the U.S. Air Force, as well as the U.S. Navy, is planning to acquire, but would also come along with greater lower observability (stealthiness), range, and payload capabilities that could be very valuable in a future high-end fight across the broad expanses of the Pacific. What is known about the Air Force's evolving CCA requirements has already pointed to significant debate about the desired range and other capabilities for those drones. Developing a true UCAV would also not preclude plans to field lower-tier CCAs designed to operate more closely together with crewed platforms. China's People's Liberation Army is also actively pursuing drones in CCA-like categories, along with ones like the GJ-11. H-6K drops multiple drones pic.twitter.com/EaQ9Hh2Cx8&mdash; ÂΩ©‰∫ëÈ¶ôÊ±ü (@louischeung_hk) October 12, 2022 It's worth noting here that China is not alone in actively pursuing flying wing UCAVs, either. Russia, India, Turkey, and others are doing so, as well. In addition, China is also surging forward in its work on autonomous uncrewed capabilities, and not just in the air domain, and technologies to support those developments, especially when it comes to artificial intelligence and machine learning. There have now long been questions about whether the Chinese government will concern itself to the same degree as the United States and many other countries when it comes to the moral and ethical questions about autonomous systems capable of carrying out lethal attacks. These will continue to be pressing questions broadly as uncrewed platforms, even very low-tier ones, with artificial intelligence-driven targeting and other capabilities continue to proliferate, as The War Zone has explored in detail recently. As our own Tyler Rogoway wrote back in 2018: 'I can tell you that our potential enemies have no trouble defining these systems or embracing their game-changing capabilities, regardless of the moral ambiguity that may go along with it. What we are left with is potentially a missed opportunity of epic proportions. We could be spending considerable effort not simply trying to build a better fighter jet but to leap-frog the enemy in full by totally changing the game via investing in advanced unmanned air combat technologies. ' 'Instead it seems the USAF and the Navy are concentrating on keeping a human totally in the loop via manned-unmanned teaming and other concepts. This is fine for some interim applications but totally keeps the great potential of autonomous swarming UCAVs under lock and key, and therefore stunts their inevitable growth.' Six years later, the U.S. military's focus remains unchanged and the Air Force has now confirmed it has no higher-end UCAVs in the works, at least publicly, even as the gap with China in this regard continues to widen.

Everything We Just Learned About The Supersized AGM-158 XR Stealt...	Lockheed Martin has provided new details about their AGM-158 Extreme Range (XR) variant of the proven Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) family of munitions. JASSM now underpins much of the USAF's deep strike capabilities and a growing portion of the Navy and Air Force's air-launched anti-ship capabilities via its sister, the Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM). We have known the XR version of this weapon has been in development for some time, but this is the first time we have seen it and have gotten official details about its configuration. This unveiling came at the Air Force Association's biggest gathering of the year ‚Äî Air, Space & Cyber 2024 ‚Äî outside of Washington, D.C., an event widely used for just this kind of official disclosures and product promotions. John Hill, Lockheed Martin's general manager for air dominance and strike weapons said the following this morning about the AGM-158 XR: 'I would say that the '158 XR' really is a story of innovation and anticipating the needs of the warfighters. It leverages an existing production line, production processes‚Ä¶ When we think of XR, think of that as extreme range. What it really does is it stretches the existing JASSM and LRASM family, that outer mold line, to give us more fuel, essentially, and that buys us the range that we need and that the warfighters need.' 'It leverages modularity. So while we're in doing modifications, we're going digital. We're leveraging the existing mission planning structure along with the existing software architecture. And as you know, JASSM or LRASM benefit from inline upgrades and fixes as they come down the production line. So for me, being part of a production line where you can incorporate changes that the warfighters ask for in stride is a pretty powerful thing. So this weapon leverages all of those really great things, and it's a great option for the Air Force to consider for the future.' The XR clearly sports the familiar trapezoidal cross-section and low-observable shaping of the JASSM and LRASM, but this new variant is substantially larger via a stretched fuselage. The XR is a substantial leap in proportions compared to its predecessors, allowing it carry much more gas, as well as a sizable 1,000-pound-class warhead. As it sits now, the land attack part of the AGM-158 family, which started service over two decades ago, is made up of the following: AGM-158A JASSM - baseline variant (no longer in production). AGM-158B JASSM-ER - baseline extended range variant. AGM-158B-2 JASSM-ER - 'replaces obsolete components and provides a new electronic fuze, a new Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, an upgraded Missile Control Unit (MCU), and enhanced software.' (according to the U.S. Air Force's Fiscal Year 2025 budget proposal); 'Obsolescence upgrade; increased computing capability, C++ missile control software. Foundational system upgrade for follow on 158B-3 and 158D variants.' (from a declassified Pentagon Modernized Selected Acquisition Report). AGM-158B-3 JASSM-ER - M-code GPS capability (still in development). AGM-158D JASSM-ER - 'Weapon Data Link (WDL) capability to re-target the missile, post-launch, against relocatable or higher priority targets during mission execution.' (again per the Air Force's proposed Fiscal Year 2025 budget; still in development). A JASSM about to be loaded on a bomber. (USAF) On top of this evolutionary roster is the anti-ship derivative of the JASSM, the aforementioned AGM-158C Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), which leverages nearly the identical airframe as earlier variants of the missile, but is optimized for attacking highly-defended ships in dense and very hostile combat environments. It includes an imaging infrared (IIR) seeker optimized for spotting, classifying, and precisely attacking vessels, as well as the ability to detect electromagnetic threats and either avoid them or use those signatures to help home in on and destroy them. A data link is also supposedly a key option, allowing LRASM to communicate in a networked battlespace, a feature that stands to vastly increase its lethality. This could also allow the missiles to talk to each other, providing cooperative swarming capabilities that can react to their environment and allow the missiles to autonomously work together to prosecute a target set or mission in conjunction with one another. An extended-range version of LRASM, also known as AGM-158C-3, which also incorporates other upgrades, is now in development. Lockheed Martin is specifically calling this new cruise missile variant AGM-158 XR, not the JASSM XR, as its vastly extended range could be adapted to the LRASM side of the portfolio, as well as the JASSM one. This would provide a survivable, very long-range maritime strike capability against highly-defended ships, which could be a critical capability to degrading China's anti-access/area-denial bubble that extends far off their shores. Further adapting and evolving existing munitions for this purpose has become a top priority and we are seeing the fruits of some of those efforts emerge as of late. The original A variant of the JASSM is thought to have a range of well over 230 miles (with some sources stating it is over 300 miles), while the ER variant boosts that dramatically to over 500 miles (around 575 miles by some accounts). The XR is thought to be able to reach Tomahawk-like distances of around 1,000 miles. This vastly expands the weapon's flexibility and unpredictability, while providing drastically increased survivability for its launch platforms, which are primarily aircraft, from fighters to bombers, and, in the future, even possibly cargo aircraft. It's also possible a ground-launched capability could emerge, too. LRASM has already been tested in the Mk 41 naval vertical launch system (VLS), as well. It's also possible that AGM-158 XR could trade warhead size to pack even more fuel inside, extending its range even further, although weight and balance issues may restrict just how much flexibility exists in this regard. The AGM-158 XR mockup at the convention. (Jamie Hunter) Lockheed's Michael Rothstein, vice president of air weapons and sensors, laid out a bit of the value proposition, including how this missile could reduce critical tanking requirements, during the Q&A with reporters today: 'You know, operationally, I would kind of put it in three things I think this brings relevance to‚Ä¶ the first is a threat. We all know, the threats continue to evolve, and ranges continue to grow‚Ä¶ When you can have more standoff [range] and still do the kind of exquisite targeting and get a survivable kind of weapon that JASSM/LRASM has proven itself to be at greater standoff [range], that's good for the warfighter.' 'The second benefit it does is that, as you were dropping things at increased standoff range, instead of having to drive in farther to the release point, you're now going back to refuel, rearm, and turn your next sortie. So it helps build operational tempo for the warfighter, because now they can generate more sorties in a day, put more mass across the target if they need to do that with other weapons, or other XRs, or whatever it may be.' 'The third&#8230; key operational standpoint, is refueling. We all know tanker bills and refueling is always a &#8230; factor for our aviation forces. You know, particularly in something like a China theater. In every theater tankers are always a hard thing. So again, if you have farther release points, that's less gas you got to drive. That's less [sic; fewer] tankers you need for that given mission set. And those tankers are then freed up, or that gas is freed up, to do other things.' 'Can't get into the specifics, but we've done the operational analysis of all of those things, on the ranges and the threat, the tankers, and certainly&#8230; there's benefit there to the warfighter that's very, very significant.' JASSM striking a mock target during an early test. (USAF) One of the AGM-158's top features is its low-observable skin coatings and underlying structures. Its ability to weave its way through the densest of anti-air umbrellas is the key selling point for the weapon. This also includes reducing its infrared and electromagnetic signature, all of which can be fused by advanced enemy air defenses to spot and potentially track stealthy targets. Lockheed Martin says that the spiral enhancements made to the AGM-158 family will be able to be adapted directly to the XR. Just the fact that this missile was designed to use the exact same production line is stated as a big advantage. The company is targeting a 1,100 missiles-per-year production goal in the not-so-distant future. The idea is that some of the missiles produced could be ERs and others could be XRs, depending on what customers order. It will be interesting to see what additional weight has been added to this larger AGM-158. All existing platforms that carry JASSM or LRASM can carry XR, aside from the F-16, according to Lockheed Martin. The F-15E and F-15EX are still well-suited host platforms, and the USAF's bomber force would certainly be able to accommodate many of them in their weapons bays and external pylons. F/A-18E/F Super Hornets can also fly with them, as well. But perhaps one of the most attractive applications could be using cargo aircraft to launch them via Rapid Dragon. These aircraft are more vulnerable than their bomber and fighter counterparts, so giving them hundreds of miles of extra standoff range could be a very enticing proposition. Another interesting tidbit shared at the press conference today regarding the missile's unveiling was that all AGM-158s going forward will have the semi-gloss black coating we see on the XR mockup and on some test LRASMs in the past. This is apparently for reducing the visual signature of the missile, according to Lockheed officials. Traditionally, at least for the most part, in-service JASSMs have been painted gray. A LRASM in flight during a test. (USAF) It's worth noting that the JASSM-related 'XR' derivative is something of a reused moniker. Nearly 20 years ago, Lockheed Martin was working on a missile with a similar name that was an outgrowth of JASSM. That XR concept had a similar range objective and was also longer than JASSM-ER by about six feet. The design featured a canard foreplanes, not a great addition to a missile built for low observability, although Lockheed Martin said at the time its impact was not a dealbreaker for the design. The current AGM-158 XR concept does not feature canard foreplanes. Regardless, that original XR variant didn't move forward and the JASSM-ER has remained the focus of ongoing production. As for when we may see a AGM-158 XR actually tested? That isn't clear. This is an internally funded initiative and moving it deep into flight test is still at least a couple years out. But considering the success of its predecessors and what the U.S. military and its allies could face in a fight across the sprawling Pacific, it would be hard to think that the Pentagon wouldn't have extreme interest in the extreme range version of JASSM/LRASM.

38,000 Russian Troops Committed To Kursk Counteroffensive: Report	Russia is stepping up its pressure on Ukrainian forces in the Kursk region, after launching its counteroffensive there last week. It‚Äôs now reported that as many as 38,000 Russian troops have been committed to the operation, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been forced to defend the incursion ‚Äî which began in August ‚Äî against mounting criticism. A report in The Financial Times cites a senior Ukrainian military intelligence official who assessed the number of Russian soldiers now involved in the counteroffensive, with some of these having been redeployed from southern Ukraine. Despite this, the same source says that the counterattack is 'still not large-scale,' and Russia will need to introduce more of its combat-proven assault brigades before making more significant gains. In the past, Zelensky has mentioned 100,000 Russian troops being required to fully repulse the incursion.

Around 460 square miles of territory were seized in the Ukrainian operation, which began on August 6. At this point, the biggest worry for Ukrainian commanders is very likely the fact that Russia has, so far, not diverted substantial forces away from the east of Ukraine, where Kyiv‚Äôs troops remain under significant pressure and continue to lose ground. In particular, the area around Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region, which is home to a major railway hub, has seen an uptick in Russian attacks. A detonation of a Russian BTR-82 in the Kursk direction.

Russian officials said that the counteroffensive launched last week quickly led to around 24 square miles of territory being recaptured, primarily on the left flank of the area occupied by Kyiv‚Äôs troops. Meanwhile, the Deepstate military analysis outlet, which has close links with the Ukrainian military, reports that Ukrainian troops are still pushing toward the north. Other reports claim that the Ukrainians are also making advances in the Russians‚Äô rear, which could even threaten to trap them in a pocket against the Seym River.

But it remains to be seen whether Kyiv is able to sustain its gains, especially with Russia seemingly happy to play the long game to claw back its territory. The Latest In an interview with CNN, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Western military aid provided so far is not enough to equip 'even four out of 14' brigades that the country 'needs to be ready.' Zelensky didn‚Äôt provide details of where exactly those brigades are needed but did point to the adverse effect of the eight-month pause in deliveries of Western aid and how it has contributed to Russian progress. The Ukrainian president also reflected on the fact that despite more arms deliveries being approved, including a major U.S. package back in April, these have so far been slow to arrive. 'We moved [to use] what we had in storage, and whatever the reserve brigades had ‚Äî [those brigades that] we need now [to fight],' Zelensky added. Of the brigades now fighting to defend the east of Ukraine, the Ukrainian leader said that 'half of them' are not fully equipped. Once again, shortages of ammunition are being especially keenly felt, Zelensky said, and more armored vehicles are also needed. In terms of the ammunition deficit, Zelensky claimed that the Russians are currently firing 12 times as many rounds as the Ukrainian troops. Western aid not enough to equip 'even 4 out of 14' underarmed brigades needed on the front, Zelensky tells CNN. The Kyiv Independent (@KyivIndependent) September 15, 2024 There are growing reports that Russia hopes to achieve a decisive victory in the war by the end of 2025 or the beginning of 2026. This is being driven by concerns that the Russian economy will start to face serious problems starting in the summer of 2025. In its recent analysis of the strategic situation, U.S.-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) argues that 'Russia will likely face growing challenges in the production and procurement of the materiel that Russian operations in Ukraine require, and the Kremlin will likely become increasingly reliant on foreign partners to meet its materiel needs.' In particular, these economic issues are expected to lead to 'likely medium- to long-term economic and force generation constraints' that would 'begin to significantly degrade Russia‚Äôs ability to sustain its war effort in Ukraine.'

Another factor around the same time period will be insufficient recruitment and the problem of whether the Kremlin decides to announce full mobilization, or otherwise reduce the intensity of its operations.

Future Stealth Tanker Plans Tied To NGAD 6th Generation Fighter‚Äôs...	The U.S. Air Force's still evolving requirements for a next-generation aerial refueling 'system of systems,' including a possible stealth tanker, will directly impact the service's reassessment of plans for a new sixth-generation stealth 'fighter.' The Next-Generation Air-Refueling System (NGAS) effort will also inform work on a second tranche of Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones. This comes amid broader and still growing questions about how the Air Force expects to achieve and maintain air superiority and refuel aircraft in flight, especially in and around highly contested environments in future major conflicts like one in the Pacific against China. Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall provides brief updates on NGAS and the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative during a keynote address today at the Air & Space Forces Association's (AFA) main annual conference just outside Washington, D.C. The overall NGAD effort currently includes the development of a crewed sixth-generation combat jet and the CCA drones, as well as a host of other related technologies, including new weapons, sensors, networking and battle management suites, and advanced jet engines. Work on an initial tranche of CCA drones, also known as Increment 1, is ongoing now, while requirements for a follow-on Increment 2 are being refined. The Air Force also confirmed in July that the NGAD combat jet program had been put on hold so that the service could take a deep look at the very core of what it wants out of that aircraft, as you can read more about here. Lockheed Martin Skunk Works 'During my tenure, we've gone through an evolution in our strategy to recapitalize the tanker fleet,' Kendall said today. 'The threat is now reaching out to longer and longer ranges. That puts both tanker and transport aircraft at risk over ever-increasing ranges. This is a particular problem for aerial refueling fighters within their combat radius ranges. ' The Air Force's current plan to modernize its aerial refueling fleets is to proceed with the planned acquisition of at least 179 Boeing KC-46 Pegasuses and 75 additional tankers in a traditional configuration. The latter aircraft are increasingly expected to just be more examples of the KC-46, a design that continues to be beset by major technical issues. Those acquisitions would then be followed by the NGAS family of systems, which could include a new crewed stealth tanker, uncrewed aerial refueling platforms, and/or other novel capabilities. Kendall has previously said that new more survivable aerial refuelers are not just desirable, but critical for succeeding future conflicts. The Air Force has previously stated a goal of having elements of NGAS start to enter service no later than 2040, if not well before then. In the meantime, the Air Force is already on the verge of retiring its entire fleet of KC-10 tankers and has been divesting KC-135s, as well. KC-135s, KC-10s, and KC-46s make up the service's current aerial refueling force. The three tankers that make up the US Air Force's current aerial refueling fleets.

USAF 'Almost two years ago, we started an Analysis of Alternatives, what we now call NGAS, the Next-Generation Air-Refueling System,' Kendall continued in his keynote. 'We are about to complete that analysis, and we are folding that work into our reconsideration of both the NGAD [combat jet] platform and the next increment of CCAs.' The Air Force has previously raised the possibility of adding aerial refueling capability to one or more tranches of CCAs, primarily as a way to increase the range of those drones. The War Zone has highlighted in the past how this, in turn, points to a desire for greater performance and/or payload capabilities, and the potential for greater-than-expected unit costs. A US Air Force graphic depicting a drone being refueled in flight. USAF 'Late last week, we issued an RFI [request for information] to industry seeking input on mission systems for NGAS and potentially for the rest of the tanker fleet, as well. This is the first step in establishing competitive vendor pools that will evaluate and enable new approaches to refueling the joint force,' the Air Force Secretary added. 'Our intent is to have simultaneous &#8230; answers about the design concepts for NGAS, NGAD, and CCA Increment Two over the next few months.' The existence of NGAS has already been a clear reflection of the fact that existing non-stealth tankers would already face serious challenges getting anywhere near the tactical edge in a high-end fight, such as one with China in the Pacific. At the same time, the U.S. military's current tactical combat jet fleets are designed around the expectation that close proximity aerial refueling support will be readily available. Fuel-hungry stealth fighters like the F-22 Raptor and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter that would be operating out in front in higher-risk areas have added limitations when it comes to carrying additional fuel in draggy external drop tanks that would negatively impact their radar-evading capabilities. Stealthy drop tanks are now in development for the F-22 and have at least been proposed for the F-35 family in the past. Cropped into oblivion but this is the first time I've seen the LO fuel tanks and pods on the F-22 pic.twitter.com/srOgbeht1e&mdash; TaskForce23 (@Task_Force23) March 22, 2024 In addition, the distributed and dispersed concepts of operation that will be key to the survival of friendly air power in a major conflict scenario will demand that tankers of any kind operate very far forward. Larger aerial refuelers will also be limited in what forward bases they can operate from. As already noted, NGAS is a family of systems concept that is expected to include multiple tiers of capabilities that could be employed in a hub-and-spoke manner, with larger tankers operating further away from threats offloading fuel into smaller and more survivable platforms. Boeing is notably set to formally unveil a proposed Land-Based Variant (LBV) of the MQ-25 Stingray tanker drone it is developing for the U.S. Navy at the AFA conference, a development that Aviation Week was to first report. The company says work on this design, which has a longer overall wingspan and the ability to carry more fuel compared to the naval MQ-25 configuration, has been funded internally and is not officially tied to NGAS, at least as of yet. Scoop: @BoeingDefense is unveiling a land-based MQ-25 with a longer wingspan, targeting potential U.S. Air Force and international interest Brian Everstine (@beverstine) September 16, 2024 The Air Force also just recently awarded two contracts for work on new ‚Äòbuddy store‚Äô podded aerial refueling systems that can offload fuel to aircraft that use the boom method. The pods could give the service's tactical jet fleets and other crewed and uncrewed aircraft the ability to turn into small, but still valuable organic tankers for forward-deployed forces. You can read more about what is known about the Small Hybrid Aerial Refueling Kit (SHARK) project here. In the meantime, questions about the complexities and costs of developing and fielding a fleet of new crewed stealth tankers are emerging. 'I haven't heard anybody recently tell me that they think that's remotely achievable within the timeframe and the budget,' an unnamed industry executive said, according to a report last week from Defense One.

JetZero 'I will say that we are still looking at our existing capabilities with what we have for air refueling, but looking for ways to be more agile with that,' Gen. Kevin Schneider, head of Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), also said in response to a question from The War Zone at a separate media roundtable on the sidelines of the AFA conference today. 'We continue to expand Agile Combat Employment [concepts of operations] to find ways that we can move into austere airfields, you know, to disaggregate our force for survivability [and] re-aggregate it for lethality.' 'Getting gas into airplanes is a key piece of that.' the Air Force's top commander in the Pacific continued. '[But] in terms of changing how we put gas into airplanes in the air, we're not going down that road yet.' Gen. Schneider also noted that his command was looking at 'being more creative' in how it gets gas into aircraft on the ground, but did not elaborate. He differed on further questions about aerial refueling to Air Mobility Command (AMC), which oversees the bulk of the Air Force's tanker fleets. The Air Force's plans for the crewed NGAD combat jet have been facing similarly increased scrutiny over cost for months now. 'As I expect everyone here knows, we are re-evaluating the NGAD [combat jet] platform design concept. The initial impetus for this was a concern over the affordability of total program cost and high unit cost,' Secretary Kendall reiterated today. 'As the Air Force operational committee looked at the design concept, which is essentially an F-22 replacement, concerns expanded to include the cost-effectiveness of the operational concept, the implications of changes in the threat, the evolving nature of the most stressing operational environments and scenarios we have to plan for, and the maturation of technology, including the introduction of CCAs.' Gen. Kenneth S. Wilsbach, head of Air Combat Command, said in July that the Air Force currently has no formal replacement plan for the F-22 Raptor stealth fighter. The Raptors are in the process of receiving significant sensor and other upgrades, as well. A row of F-22 Raptor stealth fighters. USAF 'We plan to move quickly to conduct the assessment for a variety of reasons, including industrial base impacts and the fact that both the FY25 and FY26 [Fiscal Years 2025 and 2026] budgets still have to be finalized,' Kendall continued. 'But if I were going to make a change in the NGAD platform's requirements, now is the time to do so before the next major contractual commitment and the commitment to proceed towards production.' In terms of potential industrial base impacts, competing NGAD combat jet designs from Lockheed Martin and Boeing are already understood to be in development. Northrop Grumman publicly withdrew from the competition voluntarily last year, but has said more recently that it could seek to jump back in depending on what revised requirements look like in the end. In the past at least, the expected NGAD combat jet contract looked set to be a major windfall for the winner and its associated supplier base. Tying plans for the NGAD 'fighter' now directly to expectations about future aerial refueling capabilities can only raise new questions about what the future might hold for the program. Kendall has previously left the door open for a dramatic shift in requirements, including a reduction in emphasis or even elimination of the demand for the design to be crewed. The Secretary has also previously said he was 'absolutely confident' that work on a crewed sixth-generation combat jet of some kind would move forward, but his choice of language in this regard has been steadily evolving. How larger stealth tankers fit into the NGAS equation could have particularly significant impacts on the NGAD combat jet requirements. The new sixth-generation stealth aircraft could carry less gas, and be smaller and less expensive, as well as have higher performance, if aerial refueling support could be more assured in higher-risk areas. There would still be trade-offs and risks, as The War Zone has highlighted in analyzing the growing need for stealthy aerial refueling platforms in detail in the past. 'One thing I would like to make very clear: we are not walking away from the core United States Air Force function of providing air superiority. I'll say that again, we are not walking away from the core United States Air Force function of providing your superiority,' Kendall said today to great applause from the audience. 'We are looking at what we need in order to achieve our superiority in a manner consistent with the increased threat, the changing character of war, and [in] the most cost and combat-effective way.' A rendering of a notional sixth-generation crewed combat jet. Lockheed Martin A direct link between NGAS and CCA Increment 2 could also have major impacts on the latter effort. 'So what should Increment 2 be? Do not assume and it may not be just an evolution of Increment 1. It could be an entirely different set of missions. Could be [an] entirely different kind of an aircraft,' Andrew Hunter, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology & Logistics, said at the 2024 Defense News Conference earlier this month. 'And so part of that initial work is, again, starting with a large vendor pool, what are the good ideas out there? We‚Äôll have some ideas [about] what we think Increment 2 needs to do as part of a broader force, and that‚Äôs part of this broader look at air dominance and how we‚Äôre going to deliver that.' The Air Force is still voicing a clear commitment to the broader NGAS and NGAD initiatives no matter how they might evolve going forward. Questions about how aerial refueling support will be provided in high-end conflicts are also now clearly emerging as a central factor in the service's planning for the future. 'We have a strong sense of urgency here. Our analysis must be adequate to support major decisions and to help us align our requirements, our acquisition strategies, and funding for these three programs,' Kendall said in his keynote, referring to NGAS, the NGAD combat jet, and CCA. 'Stand by for answers in the next few months.' Howard Altman contributed to this story.
