Ukraine’s Su-25s Seen Launching Hammer Rocket-Boosted Bombs For T...	For the first time, Ukraine has released an official video, which is embedded below, showing its Su-25 Frogfoot ground-attack jets employing French-supplied Hammer rocket-boosted precision-guided munitions. The compilation, showing multiple launch angles, reinforces the importance of the weapon to the Ukrainian Air Force, especially when it comes to precisely engaging Russian targets, including those located further back from the front lines. The video montage from the Ukrainian Air Force focuses on the Su-25s of the 299th Tactical Aviation Brigade (299 BrTA) as they attack Russian targets in daylight with the Hammer — also known by the French name Armement Air-Sol Modulaire (AASM; Modular Air-to-Ground Armament). At least 10 different sorties are shown, with the weapons being released in pairs, although only two individual Su-25s — the single-seaters with the Bort numbers '28 Blue' and '47 Blue' — can be identified. All the aircraft in the video have blue and yellow identification panels painted on, to help avoid ‘friendly fire’ incidents, and at least some of the launches are made simultaneous with the release of infrared countermeasures, to spoof hostile heat-seeking missiles. A pair of Hammer munitions fall away after launch from a Ukrainian Su-25. Ukrainian Air Force screencap The Hammer is the first Western precision-guided munition of any kind known to be used by the Ukrainian Su-25 — its integration on the Frogfoot was revealed by a Ukrainian Air Force official in June 2024, as TWZ reported at the time. That the Hammer is being used extensively in combat by Ukraine is no surprise — after all, France previously committed to supplying Kyiv with up to 50 of the precision-guided bombs every month. In November last year, France said that it would deliver 600 of the munitions to Ukraine by the end of 2024, with the Hammers being sourced from existing, aging stocks, with plans in the works to quickly produce more. 'The production of AASM bombs must be significantly accelerated in order to renew the [French] stocks with new munitions,' the French National Assembly Defense Committee stated. 'The Ministry of the Armed Forces now aims to produce 1,200 by 2025.' The weapons are also used by Ukrainian Air Force MiG-29 Fulcrum fighters, and it was on one of these jets that we first got a close-up look at the weapon and its specially adapted launch pylon. The Ukrainian Su-27 Flanker fighter may also use the weapon. A Hammer munition on the specially adapted pylon under the wing of a Ukrainian MiG-29. via X As we have explained in the past, the baseline 250-kilogram (551-pound) version of the Hammer has a standoff range of around 43 miles, putting it roughly on par with the U.S.-made Joint Direct Attack Munition-Extended Range, or JDAM-ER, also used by Ukraine. Unlike the JDAM-ER, however, the French munition doesn’t only rely on a pop-out wing kit to extend its range but is also fitted with a solid-fuel rocket. It should be noted that Hammer munitions can also be employed in an unpowered mode, providing a much-reduced range — if desired. The video compilation doesn’t appear to show any of the munitions underway in powered mode, but since they are all seen very soon after release, it’s likely that their motors simply hadn’t yet fired. As well as the tail-mounted range-extension kit, Hammer adds a nose-mounted guidance section to a NATO-standard ‘dumb’ bomb. All types of Hammer munition have a GPS-assisted inertial navigation system (INS) package that is designed to strike specific fixed target coordinates. There also exist multi-mode guidance options that add either imaging infrared or semi-active laser homing, allowing the weapon to engage moving targets as well as enhancing overall accuracy. This also offers alternative guidance options in GPS-denied environments, which would be particularly relevant on the Ukrainian battlefield. A display depicting different guidance options for the Hammer. Safran However, none of the munitions shown in the 299 BrTA video appear to have the transparent nose associated with the imaging infrared or semi-active laser homing options. This is also in keeping with the Hammers that we have previously seen attached to Ukrainian MiG-29s. The bombs shown are also all 250-kilogram weapons, although Hammer can also be used to adapt 125-kilogram (276-pound), 500-kilogram (1,102-pound), and 1,000-kilogram (2,202-pound) bombs. A graphic showing the core components of the Hammer weapon. Safran The bombs seen in the video all show evidence of a thermal protective coating designed to help delay them from ‘cooking off’ in the event of a fire, something that is otherwise frequently seen on U.S. Navy aircraft ordnance. Also noteworthy is the pylon that the Su-25 uses to launch the Hammer. This is the same as previously seen on the MiG-29 which you can read more about here. A closer view of a Hammer munition with its range-extending wings popping out after launch from a Ukrainian Su-25. Ukrainian Air Force screencap Suffice it to say, the pylon is of a specialized type, sharing the same general form as the one Ukrainian MiG-29s have been using together with U.S.-supplied JDAM-ER glide bombs and which is designed to providing GPS-assisted initial positioning data to their guidance systems just prior to launch. These pylons have a prominent protrusion with a GPS antenna at the forward end. As we have noted in the past, mounting this device on a protrusion will help ensure it has a clear line of sight to the GPS satellite constellation and is not shadowed by the aircraft’s wing structure. A clearer view of the Hammer pylon under the wing of the Su-25 with the protrusion at the front mounting a capped antenna. Ukrainian Air Force screencap Not visible in the video are the other changes that will have been made to accommodate the French-made weapon, specifically the cockpit interface. However, we know by now that Ukraine employs Western-supplied precision-guided munitions via an ad-hoc control system that utilizes iPads or similar tablet-like devices installed in the cockpits.

Photo by Libkos/Getty Images The appearance of the new video underscores what we already knew about the Hammer, namely that it provides the Ukrainian Air Force with a valuable option for conducting precision strikes beyond the front lines while reducing the risks to the launch platforms. The Hammer needs to be released at higher altitudes to get the most reach, although the weapons drops in the video are from a fairly low altitude, making use of a pop-up maneuver to get more range — whether in combination with the rocket booster or in unpowered mode. A graphic provides a highly schematic look at the different employment options for Hammer, including launching it up and over terrain at its target. Safran Based on information from the manufacturer, the Hammer, using its rocket booster, can strike targets at least nine miles away even when released at very low altitudes where the aircraft employing it can better hide from enemy air defenses. The weapon can also be lobbed over terrain, providing a further degree of protection to the launch aircraft. All of this is of particular importance to the pilot of the Su-25, whose mount — due to its relatively low speed and limited agility — is at particular risk from the ever-present threat of Russian air defenses. As for the booster, as well as additional range, this ensures that the Hammer impacts the weapon with a higher energy state than its glide bomb counterparts, meaning it can penetrate further into certain hardened targets. A video shows a MiG-29 employing Hammer using low-altitude toss-bombing techniques that make good use of the munition’s unique design: Footage reportedly showing Ukrainian MiG-29 fighter jet firing French-supplied AASM-250 Hammer guided bombs at a target in Belgorod Oblast of Russia.Notice the very low altitude from which the munitions are being launched.Geolocated impact point: Nekhoteevka border crossing,… pic.twitter.com/mGGuqRAmyK&mdash; Status-6 (Military & Conflict News) (BlueSky too) (@Archer83Able) June 27, 2024 The Su-25 has suffered considerable losses in Ukrainian service (as well as in Russian hands) since the current conflict began. According to the Oryx open-source tracking group, 20 Ukrainian Frogfoot losses can be visually confirmed, with the potential for further attrition on top of this. Nevertheless, with a dire need for tactical airpower, Ukraine has continued to make use of the Su-25, including adapting it to use other Western-made weapons, albeit unguided ones. In the past, we have discussed the use of U.S.-supplied 5-inch Zuni air-launched rockets by Ukrainian Su-25s, although there have been reports that the stocks of these older weapons have now been exhausted. Now, the availability of Hammer munitions means that the Frogfoot still has a useful role to play, despite the very high threat level over the battlefield. A series of photos show Zuni unguided rockets being prepared for arming Ukrainian Su-25s. via X By now, Western-provided precision strike weapons are a familiar feature of the arsenals of Ukraine’s Soviet-era jets, something that would have been almost unthinkable before the start of the full-scale Russian invasion in February 2022. With the F-16 multirole fighter now in Ukrainian service, this might well be the next platform to emerge armed with Hammer. This would have the added benefit of a weapons integration process that is much more straightforward than on Ukraine’s older combat jets, with their need for specially tailored pylons and weapons interfaces as part of ad-hoc solutions.

Chinese Underwater Sea Glider Drone Caught By Fisherman In The Ph...	Authorities in the Philippines are examining what appears to be a Chinese ocean glider-type uncrewed underwater vehicle (UUV) that a fisherman 'caught' earlier this week. At least three similar, if not identical undersea drones were found in various locations around Indonesia between 2019 and 2020. The design looks to be one ostensibly intended for maritime research use, but that could also have military applications. A fisherman recovered the UUV approximately six miles (nine kilometers) off the coast of the San Pascual municipality in Masbate, an island province in the Philippines that lies in the central section of the archipelago nation, on December 30, 2024. The drone, which is said to be around six and a half feet (two meters) long, was turned over first to the Philippine National Police (PNP) and then to the Philippine Navy. A view of the glider-type UUV in PNP custody. PNP Bicol A map showing the general location of the San Pascual municipality in Masbate province in the Philippines. Google Maps The predominantly yellow-painted UUV has a torpedo-esque main body with a single fin and stinger-like protrusion at the rear end. There are also two larger wing-like fins, which are black, attached to the body. Pictures the PNP has released show 'HY-119' and 'HY-L0119' markings on the rear of the drone. The HY-L0119 marking is visible in this picture of the glider-type UUV. PNP Bicol 'Based on our open-source research in the internet… HY-119 refers to a Chinese underwater navigation and communication system,' PNP Bicol regional director Brigadier General Andre Dizon told AFP. 'It has an antenna and an eye that can be used for viewing. Based on our research, this can be used for monitoring and reconnaissance.' Pictures, seen below, do show an aperture or port on top of the nose end of the UUV, as well as what may be rows of smaller ones behind it. There is no obvious propulsion system, which we will come back to momentarily. Another view of the glider-type UUV. PNP Bicol PNP Bicol The UUV recovered near San Pascual looks virtually identical, at least externally, to ones that fishermen in Indonesia recovered on at least three separate occasions between 2019 and 2020. The drones found around the Philippines and Indonesia also have very strong similarities to the Chinese Sea Wing ocean glider-type UUV, which the state-run Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) developed more than a decade ago. Underwater drones of this type use an internal system to alter their buoyancy, repeatedly diving and then surfacing to move forward in the water, aided by the fins along the body and at the tail. Past Chinese state media reports have claimed that Sea Wing can operate for up to 30 days and dive down to a depth of nearly four miles. Noted that this is at least the second time Sea Wing UUV found in IndonesiaIn March 2019, a fisherman made similar findings on Tenggel Island/Village, Riau Islands Laduni & TribunNews pic.twitter.com/ASxAdWPs6B&mdash; JATOSINT (@Jatosint) December 29, 2020 Yep, there are the two incidents in the article. @Peatland_Boy just highlighted a third, also a Sea Wing glider&mdash; H I Sutton (@CovertShores) December 29, 2020 Officially, CAS has used Sea Wings for various underwater research purposes, including measuring the strength and direction of currents and water temperature, oxygen levels, and salinity using acoustic and other sensors. As TWZ has noted in the past, these are common tasks for glide-type drones, which are also in service with the U.S. Navy and other military and civilian organizations globally. Sea Wing unmanned undersea vehicles arrayed in front of a Chinese Academy of Sciences research ship. Chinese Academy of Sciences Glider-type UUVs, in general, are also known to be employed for hydrographic survey work and to otherwise support the creation of underwater maps. Having highly accurate charts detailing the contours of the seabed has obvious military utility, especially for submarine operations. Underwater gliders can be used to support other kinds of military activities, as well. For instance, the U.S. Navy has said in the past that it uses these kinds of UUVs to help 'service' fixed underwater sonar sensor 'fields.' However, UUVs of this type do offer far more limited capabilities overall than more advanced underwater drones that have been and continue to be developed and fielded, including by China, in recent years. It is also worth noting that the line between civilian research capabilities and military ones is often muddled in general in China. The country's state-run civilian scientific and engineering organizations like CAS and its subdivisions have close ties directly to the People's Liberation Army (PLA). It does remain unknown what the UUV recovered near San Pascual was doing at the time, as well as whether it was operational or had stopped functioning and drifted there from somewhere else. At the same time, as was the case with the ones that fishermen 'caught' around Indonesia years ago, its appearance, especially in waters well within the bounds of the Philippines archipelago, has real potential national security implications. The PNP itself has made this clear. All of this is only further underscored by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy's (PLAN) own brief seizure of a U.S. Navy glider-type underwater drone in the hotly contested South China Sea back in December 2016. A stock picture of a US Navy glider-type UUV. USN 'The recovery of the HY-119 system has significant implications, as it provides insights into advanced underwater technology and naval capabilities,' the statement from the PNP's Bicol office adds. 'Authorities are closely examining the device as to its origin and to assess its potential impact on national security and maritime operations.' The Philippines could well reach out to allies and partners, especially the United States, to further assist with its ongoing investigation. The U.S. military and the U.S. Intelligence Community have particularly robust so-called Foreign Materiel Exploitation (FME) enterprises that specialize in gleaning a wide variety of information on capabilities and other aspects of captured or otherwise acquired non-American systems. You can learn more about the U.S. government's FME ecosystem in this past TWZ feature. The recovery of the UUV near San Pascual also comes at a time of particularly heightened geopolitical friction between China and the Philippines, primarily over Beijing's widely rejected claims to virtually all of the South China Sea. Last year saw especially aggressive actions on the part of the Chinese Coast Guard and Maritime Militia ships over Scarborough Shoal, which an international tribunal affirmed as belonging to the Philippines in 2016. Chinese authorities continue to ignore that ruling. In the meantime, authorities in the Philippines have stressed that if anyone finds any more underwater drones or other similar objects that they should not touch them and immediately contact the PNP.

How Sailor Poets Take Over U.S. Navy Deck Logs On New Year’s Day	The deck log of a commissioned U.S. Navy ship is generally not the place to mess around. In that humble book, a ship’s officer of the deck (OOD) meticulously notes vital information on weather, sea state, the status of the engineering plant, the ship’s course and speed, along with other mission-critical factors. But in the earliest hours of New Year’s Day, during the mid-watch from midnight to 3 a.m. or 4 a.m., the OOD can let their respective poetic prowess shine through, and write their deck log entry in poem form. The New Year’s deck log entry is a tradition that dates back nearly a century, to 1929, according to the Navy. Sometimes, the OOD will hand the deck log poem duties to another sailor who has a bit more writerly flair. It arguably reached its height during the Vietnam War, when deck log poems became so popular that Navy Times held an annual contest to feature the best of the bunch, according to the National Archives. But as writing increasingly takes a back seat to the phone and other electronic mediums, this Naval tradition has been in decline, and fewer than 20 ships in the nearly 300-ship fleet penned a mid-watch verse as of 2017. But it’s a cool tradition nonetheless, and we are glad to bring you a selection of deck log poems from Navy bridges over the years. Check out the U.S. Naval History and Heritage Command to read more New Year’s Naval poetry from throughout the years too. All the best to you and yours. We’ll see you next year. Quartermaster Seaman Isaiah Kiel reads a New Year's poem as Quartermaster Seaman Dalton Rodgers enters it as the first official deck log entry of 2019 aboard the amphibious assault ship USS Kearsarge (LHD-3) in 2019. (U.S. Navy) USS Gilmer (DD-233), 1942 The Navy destroyer USS Gilmer (DD-233). (U.S. Navy) The ship: This destroyer went right to work in the Pacific after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, conducting submarine patrols and escort duties. It went into a Washington state yard in late 1942 to become a fast transport ship, and was in the Pacific Northwest when Lt. j.g. L.C. Brogger penned his ship’s New Year’s deck log entry. The USS Gilmer's (DD-233) New Year's deck log poem for 1942. (U.S. Navy) The poem: We’re anchored in Port Townsend, With the anchor at short stay. Ready for any emergency, In a minute to get underway. Point Wilson bears three sixteen true From where the anchor lies; The bearing of the light-on-dock Is two seven nought, likewise. The chain is thirty fathoms long The water, seven deep; The Skipper’s in his nice soft bunk Deep in a New Year’s sleep. He hasn’t had one like it For this is the thirtieth day, We’ve hunted Nippon submarines From their base at Crescent Bay. We haven’t found a single one, Despite what fliers say; Their logs and roots and trees and stumps Have kept us underway. Young Blatz is on the sound gear, And Bowles is on the phones, Sheller’s on a machine gun But his thoughts are on his home. ‘Tis the night before New Years And all through the ship Not a creature is stirring Except Judkins – the drip. He’s breaking in the galley To rustle up some Joe, ‘Cause the wind is blowing briskly And the temperature is low. Morton’s in the engine room Keeping his turbines hot. The Boatswain’s Mate is Coxswain Rink Sleeping – like as not. I’ve tried to rhyme my log today But the Navigator’s sure to say, 'Write it up in the regular way.' USS Thresher (SSN-593), 1963 The submarine USS Thresher (SSN-593). (U.S. Navy) The submarine: The first of its class, Thresher’s story is a tragic one, as the boat sunk at sea in April 1963, mere months after this deck log poem was written. All 129 officers, sailors and civilian technicians on board died. It was also the world’s first nuclear-powered submarine to be lost at sea. To this day, Thresher serves as a grim reminder of how dangerous it is to serve in the Navy’s Silent Service. Still, Lt. J.S. Lyman brought the sailor sarcasm big time at the top of his poem. 'This entry is dedicated to the unknown, unrated and unnecessary yeoman at NavPers who so faithfully and capably reads, notes, files and forgets my continuing and constant efforts through the year,' Lyman wrote. The poem: Now read, good yeoman, and you shall see How THRESHER met the best year yet and first of ‘63 The temperature was zero or maybe just below And the winds whistled sharply, from stern to open bow. The skies were clear, although to the waters west Appeared a few broken clouds, call it 'Scattered' at best. It hardly bears repeating – you must know as well as I That THRESHER lies in Dry Dock just as high and dry As on previous days weeks months (Forgive the crossovers, please, yeo, just this once) Not a soul is missing, we’ve mustered our whole flock The ship still stands, with all hands, in #2 Dock Or did you believe that we might leave Our protected spot on New Years’ Eve? Still receiving AC power, as reported before With miscellaneous services brought from the shore. Units of the Fleets, Atlantic and Reserve Are still joined with us in our private preserve. At dock or on block, moored with wire or manila hemp Spring line or breast line, we’re all at PORTSMOUTH, New Hamp. There has been no demotion, or significant promotion In this misbegotten, all but forgotten corner of the ocean And the most rank of us on AEOLUS is SOPA still you see. (Lest you forget, the number yet, remains as ARC-3.) Thus ends my missive for tonight, the very first this year Through past performance indicates, not the very last I fear! USS Farragut (DDG-99), 2024 The Navy destroyer USS Farragut (DDG-99) returns to Naval Station Mayport, Florida, in February following a deployment. (U.S. Navy) The ship: Flash-forwarding to our last New Year, the Navy has continued a deck log poem contest, and this entry from Quartermaster 2nd Class (SW) Anthony Bentley took the top prize, scoring the sailor an engraved piece of USS Constitution, aka Old Ironsides, as well as a certificate and a commander’s coin. Hopefully Bentley got some rest too, those mid-watch shifts must be brutal. Rested or not, QM2 deftly balanced a light, breezy tone while ensuring the essentials were covered. Bravo Zulu! The deck log from the Navy destroyer USS Farragut (DDG-99). (U.S. Navy) The poem: T’was the night before wait; what did I say? Forgive me, I’ve mixed up the wrong holiday. For you see, on the seas, it can get quite mundane. This week alone, thrice, I’ve been called the wrong name! And rank, and rate, and gender no less, But whoosah, breath in, there’s no time to stress. For its New Year’s Day, if you’re wondering when, So with that, let me start over again: Once upon in a time in a land far away We’d returned to fourth fleet for one more underway. 'Catching drug smugglers' the name of the mission, Disguised as small boats supposedly fishin’. Like bloodhounds fresh on a new T.O.I., Flight quarters away and it’s time to fly. LEDET attached always second to none, Simply shining their guns ‘til it’s time for some fun. I’d hate to be smugglers, cuz they’re going to jail. Operating area: the Caribbean Sea, blue, Steaming independently, just the 99 crew. 'We’ll see so many islands!' the Captain did say, But all that we saw was Guantanamo Bay. I must include plant status or they’ll throw a cow, And use my rotting corpse as a temporary brow. So 1A, 1+2 A/C’s running online #1 reefer cooling rations just fine 2B GTM, 1+2 GTG, EMCON Condition Delta, readiness condition III. SWSP 1+2+5 ready, And FP 2+5 Pumping firemain steady. Look at that, worked it all in, oh aren’t I clever? (Though I can’t tell a lie, it took me forever.) With the countdown complete, I can lay to my rack; [Redacted] OOD, keeps the ship right on track. [Redacted], the Conn, eyes forward and keen, Through the night, ensures no contact goes unseen. Dreams of holiday routine, I’ll quickly shelve, For I must be up early for the 09-12. Happy New Year to all from our tropical tour, We look forward to the Yards all 2024. Happy New Year’s, everyone.

Biden Spends Last Of Funds Set Aside To Purchase New Weapons For ...	With three weeks left before President-elect Donald Trump takes office, the Biden administration announced nearly $21 billion in new support for Ukraine. That includes two military aid packages - including the last funds the administration can spend to acquire new weapons for Ukraine. In addition, there is $3.5 billion for direct budgetary assistance to the Ukrainian government and $15 billion in frozen Russian assets. The DoD announced an approximately $1.22 billion Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) package to provide Ukraine with 'additional air defense, air-to-ground, Unmanned Aerial Systems, and other capabilities to fight Russian aggression,' according to the Pentagon. USAI funds are for items that have to be acquired from industry. This package empties that account of funds to procure weapons from industry or partners ahead of the Jan. 20 inauguration of Donald Trump as president. The latest military donations include authorization of a Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) package, with an estimated value of $1.25 billion 'to provide Ukraine additional capabilities to meet its most urgent needs, including missiles for air defense; munitions for rocket systems and artillery; and anti-tank weapons,' the Pentagon said in a statement. This is to send Ukraine weapons currently in U.S. stocks. Unlike USAI money, however, billions remain in the Biden administration's authority to donate these weapons. National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS) (Raytheon/Kongsberg Defense) As we noted earlier this month, the Pentagon was scrambling to allocate about $6.8 billion in funds and authorities before they could dry up under the next administration. With the USAI account emptied and an additional $1.25 billion from the PDA account allocated, that leaves about $4.33 billion left for the Biden administration to directly donate from U.S. weapons stocks to Ukraine. It is unlikely that the entire amount will be spent before the Trump administration takes office, a senior U.S. defense official told reporters, including from The War Zone, earlier this month. 'We will continue to do drawdown packages for the remainder of this administration,' the senior defense official explained at the time. 'But $5.6 billion is a substantial amount of authority, so I would certainly anticipate that there could be remaining authority that would transition and be available for the next administration to use.' The capabilities in this announcement include: • Munitions for National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS);• HAWK air defense munitions;• Stinger missiles;• Counter-Unmanned Aerial Systems (c-UAS) munitions;• Ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS);• 155mm and 105mm artillery ammunition;• Air-to-ground munitions;• High-speed Anti-radiation missiles (HARMs);• Unmanned Aerials Systems (UAS);• Javelin and AT-4 anti-armor systems;• Tube-launched, Optically guided, Wire-tracked (TOW) missiles;• Small arms and ammunition and grenades;• Demolitions equipment and munitions;• Secure communications equipment;• Commercial satellite imagery services;• Medical equipment;• Clothing and individual equipment; and• Spare parts, maintenance and sustainment support, ancillary equipment, services, training, and transportation. Ukrainian MiG-29 Fulcrum firing a U.S.-made High-speed Anti-radiation missile (HARM). (Ukrainian Air Force Screencap) Since taking office, the Biden administration has provided more than $66 billion in security assistance for Ukraine, according to the Pentagon. '&#8230;my Administration is fully utilizing the funding appropriated by Congress to support the drawdown of U.S. equipment for Ukraine,' Biden said in a statement on Monday. 'I’ve directed my Administration to continue surging as much assistance to Ukraine as quickly as possible — including drawing down older U.S. equipment for Ukraine, rapidly delivering it to the battlefield, and then revitalizing the U.S. defense industrial base to modernize and replenish our stockpiles with new weapons. The Department of Defense is in the process of delivering hundreds of thousands of artillery rounds, thousands of rockets, and hundreds of armored vehicles which will strengthen Ukraine’s hand as it heads into the winter. At my direction, the United States will continue to work relentlessly to strengthen Ukraine’s position in this war over the remainder of my time in office.' Nearly $2.5 billion allocated to Ukraine by the U.S. which includes $1.25 billion drawdown package (PDA) and a $1.22 billion Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) package. NOELREPORTS (@NOELreports) December 30, 2024 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky offered his gratitude for the latest arms packages. 'This support comes at a critical moment, as Russia intensifies its assaults, even resorting to involving North Korean soldiers and continuing to receive weapons from North Korea and Iran,' he said. 'Every act of solidarity from our partners saves lives, strengthens our independence, and reinforces our resilience. It also demonstrates that democracies are stronger then autocratic aggressors.

'Our direct budget support to Ukraine arrives at a critical time as Russia intensifies its attacks on Ukrainian civilians and critical infrastructure,' Yellen said in a statement. 'Economic assistance from the United States and our allies is crucial for Ukraine’s ability to defend its sovereignty and achieve a just peace by maintaining the critical government services that underpin its brave fight.' In coordination with the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Department of State, this $3.4 billion in assistance 'marks the final disbursement of funds appropriated under the bipartisan Ukraine Security Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2024,' Yellen explained. 'Our direct budget support continues to be conditioned on reforms related to strengthening law enforcement, improving transparency and efficiency of government institutions, and bolstering anti-corruption rules and procedures.' Economic assistance from the United States and our allies is crucial for Ukraine’s ability to defend its sovereignty and achieve a just peace by maintaining the critical government services that underpin its brave fight. Secretary Janet Yellen (@SecYellen) December 30, 2024 In addition to aiding Ukraine with its own funds, the U.S. will provide it with $15 billion secured by future revenues from frozen Russian assets, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyal announced on Telegram. 'The relevant agreement was signed by the Ukrainian Ministry of Finance and the World Bank,' he explained. 'These will be funds within the framework of the PEACE in Ukraine project and part of the U.S. contribution of $20 billion under the G7 initiative, which will be directed to social and humanitarian spending. We thank the United States and the World Bank for implementing and supporting the initiative that is making Russia pay for its aggression against Ukraine.'

As we have previously noted, there are mixed signals about what his approach toward this war and future funding for Ukraine might be. Some close to Trump have suggested that the front lines be frozen as they are, Ukraine hold off on joining NATO and European troops keep the peace as part of any agreement to end the war. Russian officials, however, dismissed that concept. 'Judging from numerous leaks and Donald Trump’s interview with Time magazine on December 12, their idea is to suspend hostilities along the line of contact and transfer responsibility for confrontation with Russia to the Europeans,' Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Monday. 'We are not happy, of course, with the proposals made by members of the Trump team to postpone Ukraine’s admission to NATO for 20 years and to station British and European peacekeeping forces in Ukraine. Russia’s position of principle regarding the Ukrainian settlement is well known. It has been put forth by President Vladimir Putin on many occasions, including at the December 19 annual news conference. We have always been ready for talks, and we still are.' Russia is dissatisfied with the reported peace deal proposals on Ukraine from U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s team, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Dec. 29, according to state-owned TASS. The Kyiv Independent (@KyivIndependent) December 29, 2024 Given Russia's early reaction to elements of a potential Trump peace plan, there is no telling how he may position the U.S. when it comes time to determining how much aid Ukraine could receive under his administration. In his recent interview with Time, Trump was pressed on whether there will be continued U.S. support for Ukraine in his administration. He offered a clue about his looming approach. 'I want to reach an agreement, and the only way you're going to reach an agreement is not to abandon,' he said. The Latest On the battlefield, amid continuing Russian gains across the eastern front, Ukraine recaptured some territory it lost this year. Here are some key takeaways from the Institute for the Study of War’s (ISW) latest assessment: Kursk: Russian forces continued assaults in the Ukrainian salient in Kursk Oblast on December 28 and 29 but did not make any confirmed advances. Kharkiv: Russian forces continued ground attacks northeast of Kharkiv City near Hatyshche and Vovchansk on December 28 and 29 but did not make any confirmed advances. Luhansk: Russian forces continued offensive operations along the Kupyansk-Svatove-Kreminna line on December 29 but did not make any confirmed advances. Donetsk: Russian forces continued offensive operations in the Siversk direction on December 30 but did not make any confirmed advances. They recently marginally advanced northwest of Kurakhove, toward Vuhledar and near Velyka Novosilka. Ukrainian forces recently regained lost positions in central Chasiv Yar while both sides recently advanced in the Toretsk and Pokrovsk directions. Kherson: Russian forces continued assaults in the Dnipro direction and on the islands in the Dnipro River Delta on December 29 and 30 but did not make any confirmed advances.

'We now assess that North Korean forces are conducting massed, dismounted assaults against Ukrainian positions in Kursk,' John Kirby said on Friday. 'And these human wave tactics that we're seeing haven't really been all that effective. In fact, we assess that they've resulted in heavy casualties for these North Korean forces. Our estimate is that, to date, they have suffered more than 1,000 killed or wounded in this particular fighting in just the past week of them fighting on the front lines.' Russian and North Korean military leaders 'are treating these troops as expendable and ordering them on hopeless assaults against Ukrainian defenses,' Kirby added. 'These North Korean soldiers appear to be highly indoctrinated, pushing attacks even when it is clear that those attacks are futile. We also have reports of North Korean soldiers taking their own lives rather than surrendering to Ukrainian forces, likely out of fear of reprisal against their families in North Korea in the event that they're captured.'

'These missiles, which have been in use for nearly 40 years, are from Greece’s naval and air force stockpiles and have been deemed unnecessary for operational use by Greek military standards,' the publication reported. Back in January 2023, TWZ reported on how Ukraine was set to receive an undisclosed number of radar-guided RIM-7 missiles, to be integrated into the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ existing Buk air defense systems, known as 'Franken-SAMs' due to their cobbled-together nature. This transfer 'is part of Greece’s broader military aid to Ukraine, which includes artillery shells, weaponry and ammunition,' Ekathimerini stated. 'While the assistance aligns with Greece’s commitment to Ukraine’s defense efforts, it does not diminish Greece’s defense capabilities in the Aegean,' the publication noted. 'Despite repeated requests from allies for advanced systems like the S-300 and Patriot missiles, Athens has firmly declined, citing security concerns and the absence of reliable replacement options.' Greece is set to provide Ukraine with 24 RIM-7 Sea Sparrow Anti-Aircraft Missiles.

Zelin (@azelin) December 30, 2024 Ukraine's use of U.S.-made Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) munitions has tailed off, according to The New York Times. The Biden administration shipped Ukraine as many as 500 missiles from Pentagon stockpiles, U.S. officials told the publication. Initially not allowed to use them in Russia, Ukraine began firing them in October 2023 at targets in eastern Ukraine and Crimea held by Russians. The missiles were aimed at hardened command and control posts, weapons storage areas and some other bunkers. Ukraine was finally permitted to fire ATACMS into Russia last month. As we previously reported after Biden gave his go-ahead, the first ATACMS strikes inside Russia took place in the middle of November, at a target in the Bryansk region. At that point, Ukraine had only 'tens of the missiles' left — maybe about 50, the two U.S. officials told the NYT, adding there was no likelihood that Kyiv would get more. 'The limited American supplies had already been assigned for deployment in the Middle East and Asia,' the Times noted. 'Officials in Britain, which allowed Ukraine to use its long-range [Storm Shadow air-based cruise missiles] inside Russia after Mr. Biden’s decision, also said recently that it didn’t have many more to provide.' It is unlikely that Donald Trump will step in to fill the gap when he takes office. He recently told Time magazine that he disagreed 'very vehemently' with Ukraine’s use of ATACMS in Russian territory and called Biden’s decision to provide them 'foolish.' The next day, the Kremlin said Trump’s position 'fully aligned' with Moscow. 'Since the United States and Britain granted permission, Ukraine has launched at least a half-dozen missile strikes, using at least 31 ATACMS and 14 Storm Shadows, according to the Russian Defense Ministry and Russian military bloggers,' the Times explained. 'The Ukrainian military does not comment on the use of the missiles, but neither the United States nor Ukraine has challenged those reports.'

The facility in the village of Mamai, about 35 miles north of the border, was struck Monday at 4:30 a.m. local time, according to Mash. 'The pipeline was not damaged - as a result of the attack, a technical building on the territory was partially destroyed,' Mash stated. 'No one was hurt. The section of the oil pipeline is the last pumping point before the border, Mash noted. 'From there, oil goes to Europe, among other places. The attack came after Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico reminded Ukraine of a possible suspension of electricity supplies.

Ukraine Claims Its Drone Boat Shot Down A Russian Mi-8 Helicopter...	Ukraine says it has used an adapted air-to-air missile fired from an uncrewed surface vessel (USV), better known as a drone boat, to down a Russian Mi-8 Hip helicopter over the Black Sea earlier today. While the results of the engagement haven't been independently verified, they have been confirmed by Russian military bloggers, suggesting this is actually the first time that a USV has been used successfully to bring down an aircraft of any kind.

The missile was fired from a Magura V5 USV operated by the Main Directorate of Intelligence's (GUR) Group 13 unit. Another Russian helicopter, type undisclosed, was reportedly damaged and returned to its airfield. The missile in question, an R-73 (AA-11 Archer) air-to-air missile, has now received the name 'Sea Dragon' in its surface-launched naval application. In the video, one of the drone boats can be seen being hosed with machine gun fire, while at least one of the targeted Mi-8s can be seen releasing infrared flares in an effort to evade the heat-seeking missile. A still from the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence video shows a Russian helicopter apparently in the sights of the USV. Ukrainian Ministry of Defense screencap Evidence of Ukraine arming USVs with heat-seeking air-to-air missiles began to emerge in May of 2024, as TWZ reported at the time. The adaptation was apparently made to provide the USVs with a defense against the Russian helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft that are regularly used to counter them, but it also gives the drone boats a new offensive capability — in addition to their primary role of going after Russian warships and other surface vessels. Until now, it was unclear just how practical the extemporized arrangement was. The latest Ukrainian claims suggest it has proven effective on this occasion, although there remain questions about how the weapons actually work, especially in terms of the engagement process. Speaking today, Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, the head of the GUR, confirmed that there had been several previous unsuccessful efforts to engage Russian helicopters using R-73-armed USVs. The smoke trail left by a n R-73 missile as it heads toward its target, as seen in a still from the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence video. Ukrainian Ministry of Defense screencap A large splash shows the apparent demise of the Russian helicopter. Ukrainian Ministry of Defense screencap The R-73 short-range air-to-air missile that is used to arm some of Ukraine's Magura V5 USVs is potentially a capable surface-to-air weapon, too. As we described when the modification first emerged, the high-off-boresight (HOBS) seeker on the R-73 can articulate a considerable distance in any direction: aided by a helmet-mounted sight, the Archer can be launched in air-to-air engagements against targets with off-boresight angles of +/-75 degrees. This gives the R-73 the potential to be a particularly potent, albeit improvised threat for locking onto and engaging dynamic targets with minimal assisting sensors when used in a surface-launched form. Previous photos confirm that a pair of R-73s can be mounted on angled rails attached to the rear of the USV. A still from a Russian Ministry of Defense video shows a single R-73 on one of two angled rails mounted on the rear of the USV. Russian Ministry of Defense screencap It should also be noted that there several precedents for air-to-air missiles — including the R-73 in particular — being adapted for surface launch. The Yemen-based Houthi militants have adapted R-73s for surface launch against aircraft targets, and used them in combat, as you can read about here. The Houthis added a commercial FLIR as part of that extemporized air defense solution, which has been used to great effect, and it would appear Ukraine has adopted a similar approach for its drone boats. A schematic diagram of the R-73 missile. Public Domain Ukraine, too, has adapted the R-73 for ground launch, adding the missile to the Cold War-era, Soviet-made 9K33 Osa (SA-8 Gecko) mobile short-range air defense system (SHORADS). You can read more about that adaptation here. Close-up of an R-73 missile loaded on an Osa-AKM SHORADS vehicle. Come Back Alive Ukraine has plentiful stocks of R-73s — and likely also the older R-60s that could potentially also be adapted for launch from USVs, although the capabilities of these older missiles are inferior overall. The R-73 remains part of the standard armament for Ukrainian Air Force MiG-29 Fulcrum and Su-27 Flanker fighters.

Ultimately, successful use of R-73s fired from USVs could force Russian rotorcraft to operate further from the drone boats they are targeting, even if the probability of kill is not especially high, and the overall range of the missile markedly reduced from the 8.7 miles that can be achieved against a tail-on target when launched (in optimum conditions) in an air-to-air engagement. An R-73 air-to-air missile on display. Black bands on the weapon indicate an inert round. Vitaly V. Kuzmin/Wikimdia Commons The Russian helicopters that appear to be the favoured weapon against the Ukrainian USVs are primarily armed with heavy machine guns, unguided rockets, and potentially anti-tank guided missiles. None of these offer the standoff range that would allow the helicopters to engage USVs before coming within the engagement envelope of the R-73. The wreckage of an R-73 on a Ukrainian USV that was washed ashore and fell into Russian hands earlier this year. via X While we wait for independent verification of the success of the USV in shooting down a Mi-8, there's meanwhile no doubt that the adaptation has the potential to inflict further losses on the Russian military in the Black Sea. In particular, the development complicates Russia's actions when it comes to countering Ukrainian drone boats, providing the USVs with a deterrent and a powerful means of shooting back — more powerful than the machine-gun-armed USVs that we have previously seen in action against Russian helicopters. This is yet another calculus in the fast-evolving drone war in the Black Sea region. Already, Ukrainian USVs have inflicted disproportionate losses on Russian surface vessels operating in the Black Sea. The latest development is a further reminder of the willingness of the Ukrainian Armed Forces to improvise innovative weapons systems and to introduce these relatively rapidly to counter new and emerging threats.

39 A-10 Warthogs Went To The Boneyard This Year, More Than Double...	The U.S. Air Force sent at least 39 A-10s to the boneyard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona this year, more than double the number of Warthogs it sent into mothballs in 2023. The service is pushing steadily ahead with plans to retire the type for good before the end of the decade, if not well before then, though the venerable ground attack aircraft continue to see combat in the interim. An A-10 arrives at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base to be put in the boneyard in July 2024. USAF Data on A-10 retirements come from official monthly inventory reports from the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) released between January and September. The 309th AMARG manages the boneyard and received 17 Warthogs in 2023. There were 50 A-10As and 107 A-10Cs in storage in total, many of which are in non-flyable condition, as of September 2024. How many additional A-10s may have headed into retirement in the past three months is unknown. An example of the condition of some of the A-10s that have been at the boneyard for years now. USAF / J.M. Eddins Jr An example of the condition of some of the A-10s at the boneyard. USAF / J.M. Eddins Jr When Fiscal Year 2024 began on October 1 of last year, there were 218 A-10s in service across the Air Force, according to separate data released back in March as part of the annual U.S. defense budget request rollout. The 39 Warthogs that went to the boneyard this year represent nearly 20 percent of that total. The Air Force currently plans to retire the last of the ground attack jets, which it argues have ever-more limited survivability and general utility, especially in any future high-end operations, such as a conflict in the Pacific against China, no later than 2030. The Air Force only began retiring A-10s in earnest in 2023. For years, members of Congress had actively blocked the retirement of Warthogs, in part over questions about the ability of other aircraft, especially stealth F-35s, to fill in any potential gap in close air support capacity. Some of the debate to date has centered around the impending loss of the A-10's famed seven-barrel 30mm GAU-8/A Avenger Gatling-type cannon. The internally-mounted 25mm cannon on the Air Force's F-35As has also suffered serious issues over the years and whether or not they have been sufficiently resolved is unclear. At the same time, it is worth noting that the ground combat jets' operations have steadily trended toward the employment of precision-guided munitions rather than strafing runs over the past two decades or so. A report from the Pentagon's Office of the Director of Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) on a controversial flyoff between the A-10 and the F-35 conducted between 2018 and 2019 only emerged this year and in a highly redacted form after having been effectively buried. The independent Project on Government Oversight (POGO) only obtained that document, which is dated February 2022, through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request and subsequent ligation. You can read more about the report, which raises more questions than it provides answers in many areas, here. Regardless, the overall view of the A-10 in Congress has clearly shifted in recent years. The most recent annual defense policy bill for the 2025 Fiscal Year, which President Joe Biden signed into law earlier this month, includes a provision explicitly reducing the minimum number of Warthogs that the Air Force has to legally keep in operational service from 135 to 96. The Air Force has already laid out extensive plans for a post-A-10 force structure across its active duty components, as well as the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard. Just in November, the service announced that the 25th Fighter Squadron at Osan Air Base in South Korea would start divesting its 24 Warthogs next month. What will happen to that squadron afterward and what additional aircraft might take their place at Osan is unclear. Osan-based A-10s fly together with a South Korean Air Force KA-1 Woongbi light aircraft. ROKAF Earlier this year, the Air Force formally decided that the Maryland Air National Guard's 175th Wing would lose its Warthogs and gain a non-flying cyber operations mission in return. However, earlier this month, a separate administrative decision was also made to shift the District of Columbia Air National Guard's F-16-equipped 121st Fighter Squadron to the Maryland Air National Guard. Last year, the Air Force had also announced that the active-duty 23rd Wing at Moody Air Force Base in Georgia and the Idaho Air National Guard’s 124th Fighter Wing Gowen Field Air National Guard Base would be trading in their A-10s for F-35s and F-16s, respectively. The face of Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, long itself an A-10 hub, is also set to change as a result of impending Warthog retirements. The base is slated to become home to an expanded 492nd Special Operations Wing flying OA-1K Sky Warden light attack aircraft and MC-130J Commando II special operations tanker/transports. The 492nd, which is currently based at Hurlburt Field in Florida, will support other non-flying Air Force special operations mission sets, as well. The OA-1K Sky Warden. L3Harris This year was also the last season for the A-10C Demonstration Team, reducing the Warthog's role in the Air Force's recruitment and public relations efforts. The Air Force's remaining A-10s have continued to receive some of their most substantial upgrades in recent memory just in the past few years, including the ability to employ GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs (SDB). Many of the Warthogs still in service have also gotten new wings that have added thousands of flight hours to service lives. An A-10 loaded with 16 GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs seen during a test. USAF Despite the ongoing retirement efforts, A-10s are still flying combat missions. Warthogs were among the aircraft sent to the Middle East in October amid fears of further escalation in direct conflict between Israel and Iran and other crises in the region. The ground attack jets have since been actively used just in recent weeks to conduct strikes in Syria amid the new uncertainty in that country following the ouster of longtime dictator Bashar Al Assad. There have been suggestions that the A-10s could serve on with foreign air arms, including those of Jordan and Ukraine, after the U.S. Air Force retires the type for good. At least in the United States, the Warthog's career is more and more firmly in its twilight period, especially with the ramping up of jets heading to the boneyard this year.

The Time Navy Lt. Jimmy Carter Was Lowered Into A Partially Melte...	President Jimmy Carter’s time as a U.S. Navy officer might have been brief, but it served to inform the rest of his days before passing away Sunday at the age of 100. Prior to his political career and Nobel Prize-winning peacemaking efforts, Carter stood at the side of the father of the nuclear Navy during its infancy, and even got lowered into a melted-down nuclear reactor as a junior officer. Decades later, the former president was stunned to learn of the capabilities carried by the secretive spy submarine that bears his name to this day. Ensign James Earl 'Jimmy' Carter graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1946, and applied to join the Navy’s nuclear submarine community a few years later, according to the Navy. Assigned to the experimental attack submarine USS Barracuda (SSK-1), Carter had served as executive officer, engineering officer and electronics repair officer by the time he crossed paths with then-Capt. Hyman G. Rickover, the future admiral widely credited with birthing America’s nuclear sub fleet and ending a Navy practice of naming submarines after fish. Following that interview, Rickover soon tapped Carter to join the nascent effort. On temporary duty with the Naval Reactors Branch to help design and develop nuclear propulsion plants, the junior officer at times struggled to keep up with Rickover’s demanding pace. Former President Jimmy Carter becomes an ensign upon graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1946. (Jimmy Carter Library and Museum) Nonetheless, Carter wrote in his 1975 presidential campaign tome 'Why Not The Best?' about how Rickover left a stark impression on him, as historian Glenn Robins recalled for the U.S. Naval Institute: 'The young Carter was near the end of a two-hour interview with Rickover, which had come to function as a rite of passage for anyone seeking entrance to the Navy’s nascent nuclear submarine program, when Rickover brought up the topic of Carter’s standing at the U.S. Naval Academy. After Carter proudly announced ranking in the top 10 percent of the class of 1947, Rickover pointedly asked, ‘Did you do your best?’ Carter hesitated but answered truthfully that he had not. To which the captain queried, ‘Why not?’' Before becoming the 39th President of the United States Jimmy Carter was a nuclear baddie.He was a U.S. Naval Academy graduate and got handpicked by the iconic Admiral Hyman G. Rickover for the Navy's pioneering nuclear submarine program. pic.twitter.com/ltA13gmdz2&mdash; isabelle (@isabelleboemeke) December 30, 2024 Carter’s interview with Rickover, and the revelation that he had not always done his best, became a transformational event for the president, according to Robins. It prompted Carter 'to undergo a life-changing period of self-reflection that compelled the young sailor ‘to make the maximum effort in every single thing he did for the rest of his life,' Robins wrote. Rickover would go on to provide counsel to President Carter on a variety of topics through the years. President Jimmy Carter, right, and Navy Adm. Hyman G. Rickover during a tour of the attack submarine USS Los Angeles (SSN-688) in 1977. (U.S. Navy) After Carter joined the Navy’s nuclear efforts, the 28-year-old and his crew were sent to repair the Chalk Water nuclear reactor near Ottawa, Canada, in late 1952. The reactor had suffered a partial meltdown, and a team was needed to shut it down, take it apart and replace it. Carter and the rest of the team took a train up north and soon got to work. 'They built an identical replica of the reactor on an adjacent tennis court to precisely run through the repair procedures, due to the maximum time humans could be exposed to the levels of radiation present in the damaged area,' a Navy history recounts. 'Each member of the 22 member team could only be lowered into the reactor for 90-second periods to clean up and repair the site.' Official accounts don’t clarify whether Carter was in command during the mission, or his precise role. Still, the future president did his part, Canadian journalist Arthur Milnes later recounted. 'He was lowered into the building … with his wrench, and he had to run over to the reactor casing and he had one screw to turn,' Milnes said after interviewing Carter about the incident. 'That was all the time he had. And then, boom, back up.' Carter and the others were regularly tested after the mission was finished to look for long-term health effects. 'They let us [crew members] get probably a thousand times more radiation than they would now.' Carter told CNN in 2008 while reflecting on the incident. 'We were fairly well-instructed then on what nuclear power was, but for about six months after that, I had radioactivity in my urine.' Former President Jimmy Carter is piped aboard during his arrival at the change of command ceremony for the Seawolf class attack submarine USS Jimmy Carter (SSN-23) at Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor, Washington, in 2015. (U.S. Navy) In his autobiography, 'A Full Life, Reflections at Ninety,' Carter recounted the distinctive perils of being a submarine officer: 'Although some enlisted men could concentrate almost exclusively on their own fields of responsibility as engine men, electricians, torpedo experts, boatswains, quartermasters, gunners or operators of navigation and fire control equipment, every officer was expected to master all of these disciplines…we knew one mistake could endanger everyone aboard.' Through much of 1953, Carter served as the engineering officer for the USS Seawolf (SSN-575), the Navy’s second nuclear submarine. But life soon happened, and following his fathers death in July of that year, Carter resigned his Navy commission and returned to Georgia to oversee his family interests. The onetime junior officer later entered local politics and was elected president in 1976, serving one term. Decades later, the Seawolf class fast-attack submarine USS Jimmy Carter (SSN-23) was commissioned in 2005. The submarine’s commanding officer, Don Kelso, and a retired Navy admiral arrived at Carter’s Georgia home early that year to brief the 39th president on what the submarine could do, The New York Times’ John Ismay reported. 'He was in awe,' Kelso was quoted as saying. 'He knew it was a special submarine, because he had some background there, but he didn’t know all the details before then of what it could really do.' What the Jimmy Carter and its sailors have done on deployment remains a highly guarded secret within the Pentagon, and The New York Times cited an unnamed former senior Navy official as saying that just a few officers and a few dozen people on land actually know what missions the sub undertakes at sea. The secretive spy submarine USS Jimmy Carter (SSN-23). (U.S. Navy) TWZ has extensively reported on the Jimmy Carter, the other two submarines in its Seawolf class, and why the former president had reason to be awed when briefed on his namesake’s capabilities: 'The Jimmy Carter is the last of only three Seawolf class submarines ever built, but its hullform is different than its sister ships. During construction, it had a large plug placed in the center of its hull, making the boat substantially longer than the other two Seawolf class boats.' 'This plug accommodates room for lockout chambers, underwater remotely operated vehicles, and cargo bays for delivering and retrieving outsized cargo. A slew of other modifications were also made to the vessel. You can read all about them, as well as about the Jimmy Carter in general, in this prior feature profile I wrote about the submarine. Suffice it to say that the USS Jimmy Carter’s primary mission is espionage and spying. It can manipulate communications cables deep under the surface of the ocean and even locate and retrieve sensitive material sitting on the sea floor. It truly is America’s ultimate spying tool, and it can still hunt and fight like a normal Seawolf class fast attack submarine if it has to.' The ship’s crest recognizes the influences on Carter’s life. It features a presidential seal flanked by an atomic energy symbol and a wooden wheel. That wheel pays homage to Carter’s surname, which came from a word meaning 'wheel-maker,' according to The New York Times. The crest’s bottom features the words 'Semper Optima,' Latin for 'always the best,' which was an acknowledgement of Rickover’s formative words to Carter during his time in the sea service. The crest of the Seawolf class attack submarine USS Jimmy Carter (SSN-23) pays homage to the former president's roots. (U.S. Navy) Carter visited his sub’s crew in the summer of 2005, and got underway for an 'overnight V.I.P. cruise' following the boat’s commissioning, The New York Times recounted. 'He drove the ship,' The New York Times quoted Kelso as saying. 'And I remember I was amazed because he must have been 81 at the time, and both he and Mrs. Carter climbed up a 25-foot ladder to get to the top of the submarine’s sail and rode with us as we took the ship out to sea.' 'When we dove, he got to drive from the helmsman’s station down below, and later he went down to the mess decks to meet with the ship’s crew several times,' Kelso added. 'And I think he had a ball.' During his top-secret briefing that year on the Jimmy Carter’s capabilities, The New York Times reported, the former president said his namesake could easily take out the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan (CVN-76), named after the man who beat Carter for the presidency in 1980. Former President Jimmy Carter, center and 87 at the time, sported a proximity suit during a tour of the amphibious assault ship USS Peleliu (LHA-5) in 2012. (U.S. Navy) Carter lived an extraordinary life, by all accounts. His time in the submarine community played a critical role in all that came after, and he remained a Navy man until the end. 'You and I leave here today to do our common duty—protecting our Nation's vital interests by peaceful means if possible, by resolute action if necessary,' Carter told the graduating class of Naval Academy midshipmen in 1978. 'We go forth sobered by these responsibilities, but confident of our strength. We go forth knowing that our Nation's goals—peace, security, liberty for ourselves and for others—will determine our future and that we together can prevail.'

North Korea’s New Warship Appears To Be Designed For Vertical Lau...	North Korea's new warship design has emerged and it appears to be the largest the country has yet constructed. The vessel, which looks to be around the size of a typical modern frigate, or at the least a very large corvette, also appears to be designed to accommodate a vertical launch system (VLS) for missiles, and a phased-array radar, two advanced items not previously seen on a North Korean design. Photos of the new warship, the name of which has not been disclosed, were recently released by North Korea's state-run Korean Central Television (KCTV). The vessel is seen being inspected by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un while under construction in a dry dock at Nampho Shipyard, on the Taedong River estuary, on the west coast of the country. A view of the bow of the vessel, with shipyard officials and Kim in attendance, reveals its impressive size. KCNA The photos are undated, but the oldest shows the construction facility covered by netting, to hide it from view, but this is later seen replaced by a more permanent roof structure. According to NK Pro, which provides data analysis on North Korea, the earliest photo was probably taken before October of this year, since this is when the roof was added. Kim is pictured visiting the new warship under construction, likely in October or some time after. KCNA Imagery analysis from the same outlet suggests that Kim visited the warship under construction on at least one other earlier occasion. Previous photos of the vessel appeared in November, during a defense exhibition in North Korea, but they only showed the bow area and with very limited detail as they can only be seen in wide-angle images released of the event. The first photos of the new warship appeared on a display at a North Korean military exhibition in November. KCNA/NK Pro Before that, in September, Kim was photographed inspecting the ship and this photo was also published by state media. However, the photo was heavily cropped and there was little idea of the scale or the overall appearance of the vessel. One of the four new photos also appears to have been taken during that same visit. As for the size of the new vessel, Joseph Dempsey, Research Associate for Defence and Military Analysis at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) determines that it's 'likely a destroyer and the largest warship ever constructed in the DPRK.' According to Dempsey's previous analysis, 'the design appears to have an approximately 15-meter (50-foot) beam,' making it around one-third wider than the Amnok and Tuman class corvettes, which are the largest warships that North Korea has built for decades. The Amnok and Tuman class are both approximately 250 feet long, a typical length for a modern corvette, although the distinction between warship types — especially frigates and corvettes — is increasingly blurred. One of North Korea's Amnok class corvettes. KCNA Larger than the Amnok and Tuman class are the Najin class frigates dating from the 1970s, with a beam of around 33 feet and a length of 328 feet. Only two or three of these aging vessels are thought to still be in North Korean service. An aerial port-Nside view of a North Korean Navy Najin class corvette underway. U.S. Navy Allied Navy Dempsey suggests that the new warship is 'more than 100 meters (328 feet) long,' although it would have to be significantly longer than this to be considered a destroyer, in the modern understanding of that classification, with modern frigates already typically being longer than 328 feet. The Franco-Italian FREMM frigate is 465 feet long, and the Chinese Type 054 frigate is 440 feet long, for example. Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the new warship design is the apparent provision for some kind of vertical launch system (VLS), the presence of which is suggested by a large space immediately forward of the bridge. While there isn't a VLS has been installed so far, this would make sense considering the design and would reflect the weapons configurations on many other modern surface combatants. A view of the area forward of the bow reveals an aperture that may well be intended to accommodate a VLS. KCNA Provided that the new warship is intended to have a VLS, there are a variety of different kinds of missile that might be considered as payloads. These would include naval versions of surface-to-air missiles, as well as possibly anti-ship missiles, but North Korea is also increasingly focusing on the development of land attack cruise missiles — including some which are claimed to be nuclear-armed. More importantly, should a VLS is fitted, it would therefore provide the warship with much more magazine depth than previous North Korean warships, with the ability to field multiple types of weapons in a single launcher. An Amnok class corvette fires a cruise missiles. Reportedly, these missiles can be fitted with nuclear warheads. KCNA Notably, North Korea has also previously said it had plans for 'constantly deploying a ship loaded with new-type anti-aircraft missiles.' That might also be a reference to the new warship, and its potential VLS capability. The statement was an explicit threat to U.S. reconnaissance aircraft operating off the North Korean coast. While North Korea is currently busy with a wide range of military developments — with its missile programs gaining the most attention for its rapid advances — Kim has, in recent months, made statements focused on the maritime domain especially. Earlier this year, state media quoted Kim as saying that increasing the power of its naval forces is 'the most important issue in reliably defending the maritime sovereignty of the country and stepping up the war preparations at present.' He also called for '​​pushing ahead with the planned building of ships and unconditionally completing them within the period of the Five-Year Plan.' Kim observes a missile firing drill from aboard a North Korean patrol boat. KCNA Although not explicitly named as such, it seems likely that the new vessel is part of this warship-building program and it certainly fits within aspirations to develop naval capabilities, although it's unclear how many of the hulls might be planned. Should the first of the new vessels be completed 'within the period of the Five-Year Plan,' this would imply that it would be finished by January 2026. Based on the progress made so far, that would seem feasible, although it remains to be seen exactly what kinds of weapons and sensors might be installed and there would still be a period of testing and working up before the warship is actually commissioned into service. Another view of an Amnok class corvette. KCNA There has already been speculation that the new warship might end up going to sea with a phased-array radar, due to the large apertures on the sides of the superstructure that would accommodate the antennas for such a system. A combination of VLS and phased-array radar would strongly suggest the warship is intended to serve in an air-defense-optimized role, filling a long-standing gap in the fleet for an anti-air picket ship. Apertures cut into the forward part of the superstructure are inline with the typical locations of phased-array radar antennas. KCNA With the previous Amnok and Tuman class, a handful of vessels have been completed in shipyards on the east and west coasts, and it's possible that the new design might superseded these less-capable designs in the same yards. As well as the new vessel, North Korea is meanwhile working on other surface combatants, including smaller anti-submarine warfare vessels and missile boats, and some more innovative designs like the Nalchi class very slender vessel (VSV) with a wave-piercing hull. In addition, North Korea is also developing underwater capabilities, although with mixed successes so far. However, there has been recent evidence that Pyongyang might be developing its first nuclear-powered submarine design, which also underscores its significant naval ambitions. You can read more about that here. A satellite image of the Pongdae Submarine Factory on the northeast coast of North Korea, the center of its submarine development activities. Google Earth For now, while the size of North Korea's latest warship design is impressive and while it certainly has the potential to carry a comprehensive range of armament and sensors, major questions remain about Pyongyang's abilities to field higher-end naval military technologies in a fully applicable, integrated form. Even if North Korea is able to introduce a new warship with a usable radar system and a VLS array able to launch multiple types of missiles, it still remains to be seen whether the country has the shipbuilding capacity to build a more meaningful number of these warships.

Russian Fighter Jets Still At Syrian Base, Top Rebel Leader Pushe...	Al Jazeera has released a new video that it says shows Russian combat jets still at Khmeimim Air Base in Syria despite ongoing withdrawals. The fate of Russia's presence at Khmeimim, as well as its Tartus naval base, remains a hot topic of interest globally three weeks after the fall of long-time Syrian dictator and ally of Moscow Bashar Al Assad. Just this weekend, the head of the rebel coalition that ousted Assad pushed back on calls for a complete disengagement with the Kremlin, including when it comes to military affairs. Al Jazeera released the new footage of Khmeimim (also written Hmeimim), taken using a drone and seen below, earlier today, but did not say when it was shot. A machine translation of the accompanying Arab text says 'exclusive footage from Al Jazeera shows a large presence of warplanes inside the Russian Hmeimim base.' TWZ was not able to directly align what is seen in the clips with available satellite taken of the base recently. Other similar but distinctly different footage of Khmeimim captured using a drone had emerged back on December 12. مشاهد خاصة للجزيرة تظهر تواجد كبير لطائرات حربية داخل قاعدة حميميم الروسية#فيديو pic.twitter.com/uECy9iUndG&mdash; الجزيرة سوريا (@AJA_Syria) December 30, 2024 The footage from Al Jazeera does show three Flanker-series fighters and a swing-wing Su-24 Fencer combat jet under protected shelters at the northeastern end of the base are clearly seen at one point. Another view shows what looks to be four more Flankers and/or Su-34 Fullbacks (which both have prominent 'stingers' that extend from their tail ends), as well as six additional Fencers. The video from Al Jazeera also shows additional aircraft and other activity at Khmeimim, including two Russian Il-76 Candid cargo planes and another one belonging to Syrian Airlines, on an open apron at the northwestern end of the facility. The Syrian Airlines Il-76 may be one that went missing in the final chaotic moments before Assad's fall, as you can read more about here. Smaller An-26 Curl and An-72 Coaler cargo aircraft, as well as an An-30 Clank, are visible elswhere at Khmeimim in the latest footage from Al Jazeera. The An-30 is ostensibly an aerial survey aircraft, but can also be used as a transport. The video prominently shows ground-based radars still in operation at the base, as well. At least one of the radars looks to be a variant of the P-18, which can be used for air traffic control and general air surveillance. At the same time, even in the drone footage Al Jazeera has now put out, there are signs that Russia is continuing to withdraw from Khmeimim. The video shows smoke billowing from an area just off to the side of the open apron where the Il-76s are parked, which could be from the burning of materiel. Destroying certain assets in place using fire and other means is commonly seen when military forces depart overseas facilities, especially if they have to do so on relatively short notice following major upheaval in a country.

Russia's military had already removed air defenses, including an S-400 surface-to-air missile system, and other materiel from Khmeimim. Russian forces that had been deployed elsewhere in Syria have also been congregating in recent weeks at the base, which is now under the watchful eye of rebel forces.

The facilities offer the Kremlin highly strategic and unique air and naval power projection nodes for operations in the Mediterranean and Africa. Russia's intervention in Syria beginning in 2015 was instrumental in keeping Assad in power and, by extension, retaining access to these important facilities. The regime in Damascus rewarded Moscow by essentially gifting it the bases through a 49-year 'lease' deal in 2017. There are reports that Russia could be redeploying forces from Syria to bases in Libya and elsewhere in Africa. A view of a gate to Khmeimim Air Base on December 29, 2024.

AAREF WATAD/AFP via Getty Images AAREF WATAD Russia's relationship with Assad and its active operations against the same rebels now seeking to form a new Syrian government have raised obvious questions about the future of its bases in the country. Combat jets at Khmeimim were still flying strikes against rebel forces right up until the collapse of the former regime. However, 'we don't want Russia to exit Syria in a way that undermines its relationship with our country,' Ahmad Al Sharaa said in an interview with Saudi Arabian state-owned news outlet Al Arabiya this weekend. 'We do not want Russia to leave Syria in the way that some wish.' Al Sharaa, still better known by his nom de guerre Abu Mohammad Al Jolani (and other simply just as Jolani), is head of Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which led the rebel coalition that deposed Assad. 'All of Syria's arms are of Russian origin, and many power plants are managed by Russian experts,' Al Sharaa further told Al Arabiya, while also highlighting the 'deep strategic interests' of what he described as the 'second most powerful country in the world.' Ahmad Al Sharaa addresses a crowd at Umayyad Mosque in Damascus in the immediate aftermath of the fall of Assad's regime on December 8, 2024. Aref TAMMAWI/AFP via Getty Images In his interview with Al Arabiya, Al Sharaa also said that 'Syria cannot continue without relations with an important regional country like Iran,' but stressed that relations 'must be based on respect for the sovereignty of both countries and noninterference in the affairs of both countries.' The HTS leader has been particularly vocal in his criticism of the regime in Tehran, another one of Assad's major foreign benefactors, and how it wields its regional influence. Since the fall of Assad, Al Sharaa has been very actively working broadly to present the new government HTS is working to form as a pragmatic and moderate entity. HTS is an evolution of an Al Qaeda franchise in Syria, but claimed to have broken ties with the international terrorist organization in 2016. HTS itself remains a designated terrorist group in Russia, as well as the United States and many other countries. The U.S. government is reportedly set to withdraw a $10 million bounty on Al Sharaa personally following a visit to the country by an American delegation earlier this month. As the fledging government in Damascus works to move Syria beyond its pariah status under Assad, it is also facing pressure to realign itself, particularly away from Russia. Ukraine has notably been positioning itself as an alternative partner for the new Syrian government. Ukrainian operatives had reportedly worked with Syrian rebel groups, particularly when it came to providing assistance in expanding their kamikaze drone capabilities, in the lead-up to the fall of Assad. 'We believe that from a strategic point of view, the removal of Russia’s presence in Syria will contribute to the stability of not only the Syrian state but the entire Middle East and Africa,' Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha‎ said in a statement around an official visit to Damascus just today where he met with Al Sharaa and others. 'The Russian and Assad regimes supported each other because they were based on violence and torture.' Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha‎, at left, meets with Ahmad Al Sharaa, at right, in Damascus, on December 30, 2024. Ali Haj Suleiman/Getty Images For their part, Russian authorities have persistently claimed that no final decision has been reached on Khmeimim and Tartus, despite reports that they could be on the verge of being forced out of Syria. HTS-led authorities in Damascus still face broad challenges in establishing a functional nationwide government in a country where various other domestic and international actors continue to hold significant sway. Fighting between Turkish-supported and U.S.-backed forces in the northeastern end of the country has spiked since the fall of Assad. Israel is also now occupying a portion of southern Syria, ostensibly as a buffer zone amid the ongoing geopolitical uncertainty. Israeli and American forces have also taken advantage of the newly permissive airspace over Syria, especially the once heavily guarded western end of the country, to launch major airstrikes in recent weeks targeting former regime military assets and ISIS terrorists, respectively. For the moment, at least, Russia does continue to maintain a military presence in Syria, including combat jets still at Khmeimim, despite the continued signs of withdrawal.

U.S. Army’s First Combat Use Of THAAD Missile Defense System Just...	One of America’s prized Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) batteries fired an interceptor in combat for the first time Thursday. The system, forward-deployed in Israel, was employed against an incoming medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) fired by the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, a U.S. military official told TWZ. The official added that it was unclear as of Friday if the U.S. interceptor or an Israeli one actually took out the missile. A THAAD battery belonging to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) scored the system's first kill overall in 2022, as you can read more about here. Video appeared online purportedly showing the U.S. THAAD interceptor's launch in Israel earlier today. A voice was heard saying he had waited '18 years waiting for this,' a potential reference to the system's age, as the U.S. Army stood up its first THAAD battery in 2008, after it was developed beginning in the early 1990s. מערכת ה- THAAD האמריקנית לקחה חלק ביירוט הטיל הבליסטי ששוגר אמש מתימן. אפשר לשמוע את אחד החיילים האמריקניים מתרגש '18 שנים חיכיתי לזה' pic.twitter.com/s4VoMfMhaF&mdash; איתי בלומנטל Itay Blumental (@ItayBlumental) December 27, 2024 The THAAD battery and about 100 soldiers were deployed to Israel in October to bolster Israel’s defenses ahead of an expected Israeli retaliation for Tehran’s massive missile barrage earlier that month. A counter-attack from Iran never came to fruition, but the battery has stayed in place. Houthi rebels have launched sporadic missile barrages at Israel for months, including while Israel was conducting airstrikes on multiple targets in Yemen during the early hours of Dec. 19. A supporter of Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels fields a diorama of a U.S. warship under a Houthi missile during a demonstration in the capital Sanaa on Dec. 6, 2024. (Mohammed Hamoud/Getty Images) On Friday, the Yemeni rebel group said it had launched a missile at Israel’s Ben Gurion Airport and also targeted Tel Aviv with a drone attack, all in retaliation for recent Israeli strikes on Sanaa International Airport, the Guardian reported. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the ballistic missile was intercepted before it reached Israeli airspace. Still, residents in central Israel were ordered into shelters for fear of falling debris, the publication noted, adding that there were no reports in Israel of hostile drones over Tel Aviv. The exact configuration of the THAAD battery currently in Israel is unclear, but a unit of this kind can include up to nine transporter-erector-launchers, each carrying eight interceptors, as well as a long-range AN/TPY-2 X-band radar, a mobile fire control and command and control center, and various supporting equipment. Additional interceptors would be available to reload the launchers during a combat deployment, as well. It is a terminal missile defense system, meaning it takes out short-, medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles in the final stages of flight, as they careen down through the atmosphere at their final targeted destinations. A briefing slide showing the general composition of Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) batteries as of 2016. (U.S. Defense Department) For Israel, the THAAD sits at the top end of air defense systems in the country capable of terminal phase missile defense, which also includes David's Sling and the Arrow 2 system. Israel recently retired its Patriot surface-to-air missile batteries, which had terminal missile defense capabilities. The land-based terminal phase intercept capability can be augmented by positioning U.S. Aegis-equipped surface combatants loaded with SM-6 missiles off the Israeli coast. Israel also has a robust mid-course intercept capability in the form of the Arrow 3 system and the same U.S. Navy ships loaded with SM-3s can also provide this capability. The U.S. Army’s seven THAAD batteries have seen multiple short and long-standing deployments in the past. In addition to the one presently in Israel, two more of the units are currently forward-deployed, one in Guam and one in South Korea. While Thursday’s intercept was the first time the U.S. Army had fired the system to defeat an incoming threat, as we noted earlier, the UAE used its THAAD system to bring down a Houthi ballistic missile that was targeting an oil facility near Al Dhafra Air Base, which was hosting U.S. and French forces in addition to Emirati personnel when the attack took place in January 2022. Go here to read TWZ's past reporting on that intercept. A Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) array fires. www.twz.com The deployment this past October was not the first time a THAAD had been sent to Israel, either. The U.S. Army sent the system there in 2019 for an exercise, part of a Pentagon effort to test quickly deploying capabilities, while keeping adversaries from having too much foreknowledge about U.S. military plans, TWZ reported at the time. The U.S. Army has maintained a long-range AN/TPY-2 X-band radar at Site 512, a so-called 'cooperative security location' in Israel’s Negev Desert, since 2012, to bolster Israeli and U.S. missile defenses. The service also started manning a location known as Site 883 in 2017 at Israel’s Bislach Air Base, also in the Negev, seemingly to help streamline the flow of critical data from Site 512, another sign of America’s burgeoning air and missile defense capability in Israel before the current conflict erupted. While Thursday’s intercept marks a THAAD milestone for the U.S. Army, it once again highlights strains in the service’s air defense systems and the soldiers who man them, finite capabilities that are increasingly deployed around the world. TWZ investigated the issue in-depth in 2023, and you can read that coverage here. Demand within the U.S. military for advanced air defense systems, including THAAD, and the interceptors that go with them, has only increased since then. Obligations in the Middle East, including to help defend Israel, as well as in Europe, particularly to Ukraine, have been important driving factors. Growing concerns about Chinese military threats in the Pacific have also prompted new air and missile defense needs. Army Secretary Christine Wormuth acknowledged the stressors being placed on air defense batteries at the time of the THAAD deployment to Israel. Wormuth noted that 'the air defense artillery community is the most stressed,' and said that such units have the highest operational tempo. To mitigate that, Wormuth said the service was trying to modernize its integrated and missile defenses to create more capacity. That in part involves integrating the Patriot battery’s new Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS) into the Army’s Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS) network. Wormuth said that integration would 'greatly increase the capacity of the existing Patriot force that we have, and that will help reduce some of the stress on our soldiers.' Test firing a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) interceptor. (U.S. Army) TWZ has previously broken down what LTAMDS brings to the table: 'LTAMDS is designed to provide higher-fidelity sensing capability at much further distances and process a wider array of data more quickly than the Patriot’s current radar. It can also offer 360-degree coverage, which the current system cannot. The IBCS connects various sensors to effectors like, gun systems, lasers, missile systems, and electronic warfare capabilities and combines all this data on the entire air defense situation into a single actionable ‘picture’ for operators. The combination is meant to give air defenders a much greater ability to better react to and if necessary shoot down a multitude of threats at once.' Still, while this force multiplying new technology will certainly help, physically more missile batteries are also a critical part of the solution, but just how much investment will be poured into doing so remains to be seen. Other Army lines of effort involve being 'as choosy as we can about what we take on,' so as to minimize stress on the force, Wormuth said.

Russian-Linked Oil Tanker Suspected Of Sabotage Was Brimming With...	The Eagle S - a tanker ship carrying Russian oil and suspected of severing the Estlink 2 power cable running under the Baltic Sea between Finland and Estonia - was reportedly brimming with spy equipment. The cable incident is the latest in a series of such events in this strategically important region as tensions with Russia have mounted in the wake of its war on Ukraine. After being seized by Finnish Police, the Eagle S was found to be 'kitted out with special transmitting and receiving devices that were used to monitor naval activity, according to a source with direct involvement in the ship,' Lloyds List reported. That equipment 'effectively allowed it to become a 'spy ship' for Russia.' Russia-linked cable-cutting tanker seized by Finland ‘was loaded with spying equipment’ Michael Weiss (@michaeldweiss) December 27, 2024 'The hi-tech equipment on board was abnormal for a merchant ship and consumed more power from the ship’s generator, leading to repeated blackouts, a source familiar with the vessel who provided commercial maritime services to it as recently as seven months ago,' the publication noted. The 'listening and recording equipment was brought on to the 20-year-old tanker via 'huge portable suitcases' along with 'many laptops' that had keyboards for Turkish and Russian languages when calling at Türkiye and Russia,' Lloyd's List reported. 'The equipment was kept on the bridge or in the 'monkey island,' the uppermost portion of the ship.' 'The transmitting and receiving devices were used to record all radio frequencies, and upon reaching Russia were offloaded for analysis,' the outlet added. 'They were monitoring all NATO naval ships and aircraft. They had all details on them. They were just matching their frequencies.' The equipment was being operated by 'Russians, Turkish, Indian radio officers,' Lloyds List stated. 'Eagle S also dropped 'sensors-type devices' in the English Channel during a transit,' the publication's sources claimed. The War Zone cannot independently verify these claims, however, a shipping industry security source told us that they 'are plausible.' After the Eagle S was seen in the location within the Finnish Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) where the Estlink 2 cable was severed, the Finnish police, in cooperation with other authorities, boarded and seized the 750-foot-long, Cook Island-flagged oil tanker and took it into their territorial waters. Finnish authorities also launched a criminal investigation. The vessel movement of Eagle S is very irregular and corresponds with the location and time of the damage to the Estlink 2 cables. pic.twitter.com/IpEUq13n3k&mdash; Kamsarmax (@cashsarmax) December 25, 2024 'The Helsinki Police Department and the Border Guard have conducted a tactical operation on the vessel,' the Finnish Police said in a statement on Thursday. 'The authorities have taken investigative measures on the vessel, with access there provided by the Finnish Border Guard and the Defence Forces helicopters. The police are also looking into other possible damages in the maritime area.' Finnish investigators believe Eagle S may have caused the damage by dragging its anchor along the seabed, Reuters reported. United Arab Emirates-based Caravella LLCFZ, which owns the vessel according to MarineTraffic data, did not respond to our request for comment. The 658 megawatt (MW) Estlink 2 outage began at midday local time on Wednesday, leaving only the 358 MW Estlink 1 linking Finland and Estonia, the countries' electricity grid operators told Reuters. The following day, officials said that four telecommunications cables connecting Estonia with Finland under the Baltic Sea were also out of service. Fingrid's EstLink 2 transformer station in Anttila in Porvoo (Borga), Finland (Photo by Markku Ulander / Lehtikuva / AFP) / Finland) MARKKU ULANDER Friday morning, Finnish President Alex Stubb said that 'the situation is under control.'

After Estonia experienced power outages following the severing of Estlink 2 on Dec. 25, its officials, along with those from Finland, asked NATO for help protecting the Estlink 1 undersea power cable about 25 miles to the west. On Friday, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte responded by saying the alliance will 'enhance' its presence in the Baltic Sea without offering any details. When asked for specifics by The War Zone, a NATO spokesman declined to 'provide operational details at this time.'

'The Estonian Navy is commencing the protection of the Estlink 1 sea cable with the patrol ship Raju, cooperating with the Finnish Navy and the Supreme Allied Commander Europe of NATO (SACEUR) to secure energy connections between Estonia and Finland,' the Estonian Navy said on Twitter.

Cavoli, the SACUER, told us he is considering a 'serious' response that could involve U.S. assets. 'The Supreme Allied Commander Europe has followed this closely since the beginning,' SACUER spokesman Martin O’Donnell told The War Zone. 'The possible sabotage of undersea cables is a serious matter, and it requires an equally serious and thoughtful response.' Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) 'has options and assets from 32 countries, including the U.S., available to respond,' he added. 'SHAPE, in close coordination with Allied Joint Force Command Brunssum, Allied Maritime Command, and the involved nations are coordinating employment of those options and assets, but I am not in a position to provide further operational details at this time.' A spokesman for the Finnish military declined comment, deferring questions to the Finnish police, who are leading the investigation into the cable rupture. The suspected sabotage of the Estlink 2 power cable is the most recent of several such incidents. In November, Germany said damage to two communication cables running under the Baltic Sea was most likely the result of sabotage. The two cables in question are both fiber-optic communication cables, running along the Baltic seabed. One of these runs between the Swedish island of Gotland and Lithuania, and the other between Finland and Germany. Gotland is about 280 miles southwest of where the Estlink 2 cable was severed. A day later, Denmark confirmed it was monitoring a Chinese cargo vessel at the center of allegations surrounding that damage. The 735-foot-long Yi Peng 3 was identified as operating near the cables when the incidents occurred. The Chinese vessel had departed the Russian port of Ust-Luga, in the Leningrad region, close to the Estonian border, on Nov. 15 and had been scheduled to sail to Port Said, Egypt, where it was originally due to arrive on Dec. 3. Based on publicly available ship-tracking data, the Yi Peng 3 appears to have passed overhead both of the cables around the same time incidents of damage were first reported. The Chinese ship, the bulk carrier Yi Peng 3 is anchored and being monitored by a Danish naval patrol vessel (unseen) in the sea of Kattegat, near the City of Granaa in Jutland, Denmark, on November 20, 2024. (Photo by Mikkel Berg Pedersen / Ritzau Scanpix / AFP) / Denmark OUT MIKKEL BERG PEDERSEN According to the German newspaper Kieler Nachrichten, when the damage to the C-Lion1 cable was confirmed, the Yi Peng 'stopped, drifted, and sailed two circles in the sea area south of Öland for almost 90 minutes.' 'No one believes that the cables were accidentally damaged,' German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said at the time. 'I also don’t want to believe that the ships’ anchors caused the damage by accident. We have to assume, without certain information, that the damage is caused by sabotage.' Two undersea communication cables, one linking Finland to continental Europe via Germany and another linking Lithuania and Sweden's Gotland Island were damaged last month. (Photo by Murat Usubali/Anadolu via Getty Images) Anadolu Other suspicious activities have taken place in the Baltic Sea, including suspected sabotage. Most notoriously, there was a series of explosions along the Nord Stream gas pipelines in 2022. The cause of these is still being investigated by German authorities however The Wall Street Journal reported in August that it was a Ukrainian sabotage operation. Ukrainian officials denied that accusation. Outside of the Baltic, there have been other incidents of reported sabotage of critical communications cables, including one associated with Evenes Air Station, in northern Norway, which happened in April, but was only disclosed in August, as TWZ reported at the time. Norway has seen other suspicious incidents in the past, notably the cutting of a vital undersea cable connecting Svalbard to mainland Norway in 2022. While the Baltic Sea has long been of strategic significance for both Russia and NATO and its allies, there has been a spike in incidents in these waters since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Though no blame has yet been officially assigned for the Estlink 2 cable cut, the fact that a Russian-connected ship packed with surveillance equipment is suspected only adds to the regional tension.

China’s New Domestically Developed Y-20 Airborne Early Warning Je...	Pictures have emerged of what looks to be the first known example of a new Chinese airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft based on the four-engine Y-20 cargo plane. China already has a remarkably large fleet of AEW&C platforms, but most of them are smaller turboprop designs, as TWZ has previously explored in detail. A modern, large, jet-powered type that is based on a locally produced aircraft could succeed or at least augment the small number of existing jet-powered KJ-2000 Mainrings based on the Russian Il-76 Candid airframe. The Y-20 AEW&C aircraft's appearance comes among a number of major Chinese military reveals in the past two days, including the emergence of two previously unseen Chinese advanced combat jets, as well as the official launch of the PLAN's first monster Type 076 amphibious assault ship. pic.twitter.com/kww8ewKZhQ&mdash; OedoSoldier (@OedoSoldier) December 27, 2024 There have been reports for years now that a Y-20-based AEW&C plane, often referred to colloquially as the KJ-3000, has been in the works. The current expectation is that such an aircraft would be based on the up-engined Y-20B variant that first emerged in 2020. Developed by the state-run Xi’an Aircraft Company (XAC), the baseline Y-20A cargo jet first flew in 2013. An aerial refueling tanker variant of the Y-20, known variously as the Y-20U and YY-20B, is also now in service. A picture of an up-engined Y-20B. Chinese Internet A baseline Y-20A. Taiwan Ministry of National Defense The pictures of the apparent KJ-3000 that began circulating online yesterday, offering a limited view of its configuration. It does have a large circular radome on top of the rear end of the fuselage as is commonly seen on many AEW&C aircraft, including the existing Chinese KJ-2000, as well as the Russian A-50 Mainstay (also based on the Il-76) and U.S. E-3 Sentry.

USAF From what is visible now, the new Y-20-based design may have additional large domes on top of the forward fuselage and underneath the tail. The KJ-2000 and the A-50 both have additional domes on top of and below the forward fuselage linked to their extensive communications suites, another critical component of any AEW&C aircraft. The KJ-3000 could have other intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities beyond just its radar, as well. Ok, it goes on and on and on: second surprise this morning, the new KJ-3000 (?) AEW performed its maiden flight at XAC and from what can be seen on the first few small & blurry images, it is as expected a Y-20B-based design featuring a large rotodome but also a bulge on the tail. pic.twitter.com/MTp9A6dfDh&mdash; @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) December 27, 2024 It notably remains to be seen how exactly the KJ-3000's main radome might be configured. Unlike the rotating main radomes on the A-50 and the E-3, the ones on top of China's existing KJ-2000s, as well as its turboprop KJ-500s, are fixed and use three separate active electronically scanned array (AESA) antennas to provide 360-degree coverage. Whatever radar and other mission systems the KJ-3000 might have, for China, just having new AEW&C aircraft leveraging a larger jet-powered airframe would be beneficial. There are only four operational KJ-2000s and it was something of a saga to acquire them in the first place, as you can read more about here. The People's Liberation Army Air Force and Navy (PLAAF and PLAN) have fielded a large number of increasingly capable domestically-developed turboprop AEW&Cs over the years, as you can learn more about in this past TWZ feature. However, a Y-20-based type would offer advantages in terms of speed, range, and on-station time. It would also be able to fly at higher altitudes to provide a better perch for its radar. This is very important, especially for providing ‘look down’ capability to spot and track low-flying aircraft and missiles that radars down below might not be able to 'see' due to terrain and other factors In addition, the KJ-3000's larger crew would be better able to handle longer endurance and more complex missions. If the Chinese were to add aerial refueling capability to the aircraft it would further extend its reach and total mission time. Versions of the turboprop KJ-200 and KJ-500 AEW&C aircraft with aerial refueling probes have been developed. A KJ-500A with an aerial refueling probe. Chinese Internet As a completely locally developed platform, the KJ-3000 would be easier to maintain and sustain, as well as upgrade, compared to the KJ-2000s. The Mainrings are understood to be expensive to operate and are tied to supply chains in Russia. A Y-20-based design could even open a possible path to the export market. China does offer turboprop AEW&C aircraft for sale on the open market and has sold examples to Pakistan. AEW&C aircraft, in general, are important elements of any modern air force. This is especially the case for the PLA, which continues to expand the size and scope of its tactical and strategic aviation fleets. Aircraft like the KJ-3000 help Chinese forces extend and support anti-access and area denial bubbles, including around the mainland, Taiwan, and the hotly contested South China Sea, as well as project power further afield. As TWZ has written in the past: 'The proliferation of Chinese AEW&C aircraft, in particular, points to changing visions of future warfare, including not only defending the People’s Republic but also increasingly projecting power over greater distances, and in a wider variety of regions, including the highly strategic South China Sea. The Chinese military clearly values its AEW&C capability highly, providing them not only with airspace surveillance including a vital look-down capability, but also monitoring the sea, to a lesser degree.' &#8230; 'Having such a large and expanding fleet of AEW&C platforms and their particular characteristics also point to how these aircraft might actually be used in a potential future conflict, perhaps one involving the U.S. military. With this kind of capacity, China should be able to not only cover the approaches to their most strategic areas but also operate from more dispersed and even austere bases. Smaller types, in particular, like the turboprop-powered KJ-200 and KJ-500 series are especially well suited to these kinds of operations and are regular features at China’s island outposts, as well as operating routinely in the highly strategic Taiwan Strait.' 'Production and deliveries of the KJ-500 – the PRC’s [People's Republic of China] most advanced airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft – continued at a rapid pace, joining earlier KJ-2000 Mainring and KJ-200 Moth variants,' according to the Pentagon's most recent annual report on Chinese military developments, which it released earlier this month. 'These aircraft amplify the PLAAF’s ability to detect, track, and target threats in varying conditions, in larger volumes, and at greater distances. It extends the range of the PLA’s IADS [integrated air defense system] network.' A Chinese KJ-200, which has a 'balance beam' style radar array on top of its fuselage rather than a type inside a circular radome. Alert5 via Wikicommons (Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International license) U.S. military officials have also highlighted the significance of Chinese AEW&C developments in the past, especially for controlling more and more capable combat jets armed with ever-longer-ranged air-to-air missiles. 'We notice that they are flying it [the J-20 stealth fighter] pretty well,' Gen. Kenneth Wilsbach, then head of Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), said in 2022. 'We recently had – I wouldn’t call it an engagement – where we got relatively close to the J-20s along with our F-35s in the East China Sea, and we’re relatively impressed with the command and control that was associated with the J-20.' 'Some of their very long-range air-to-air missiles are aided by that KJ-500,' Wilsbach, who is now head of Air Combat Command, added at that time. More certainly remains to be learned about the KJ-3000, but it is a logical addition to the PLA's existing AEW&C fleets that looks set to provide valuable additional capabilities.

China’s Monster Type 076 Amphibious Assault Ship Seen Like Never ...	China has held a launch ceremony for its first super-sized Type 076 amphibious assault ship, now named Sichuan, though the vessel does not look to have gone into the water yet. Imagery from the event does offer the best look at the ship to date, including its twin island configuration, its wide flight deck with a single electromagnetic catapult, its well deck, and its extensive array of close-in defenses. The ceremony at Hudong-Zhonghua Shipyard notably comes just a day after two different previously unseen Chinese advanced combat jet designs broke cover. The ceremony took place today, Friday, December 27, at a dry dock at Hudong-Zhonghua Shipyard on Changxing Island in Shanghai where Sichuan has been under construction since at least October 2023. Hudong-Zhonghua is a subsidiary of the state-owned China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC). 一切为了攻击！ pic.twitter.com/ToEeSJPc0y&mdash; DS北风（风哥） (@WenJian0922) December 27, 2024 祝贺大四川喜提076 pic.twitter.com/jP0BifBKd0&mdash; DS北风（风哥） (@WenJian0922) December 27, 2024 China Type 076 LHD Launch Footage on spot • PLA Navy pic.twitter.com/bLL9HrZOE1&mdash; David Wang (@Nickatgreat1220) December 27, 2024 Official pictures and satellite images from Planet Labs that TWZ reviewed show that the dry dock where the Type 076 is situated, and which it also shares with two other warships under construction, is not flooded. When it might actually enter the water for the first time is unclear. The ceremony is still a significant event and Sichuan, also now known by its hull number 51, certainly looks ready for a true launch. As TWZ has explored in detail in the past, the Type 076 is really unlike any other amphibious assault ship in service or under construction anywhere else in the world at present. A look at the Type 076 during the launch ceremony. Chinese Internet An official statement from the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) says Sichuan will displace around 40,000 tons with a full combat load. Previous analysis by TWZ puts the ship's length at around 864 feet and its width at some 141 feet wide (or 263 and nearly 43 meters, respectively). This all makes the Type 076 substantially larger than China's existing Type 075 amphibious assault ship. The design is also notably wider than other big deck amphibious warfare ships in service globally, such as the U.S. Navy's America class.

There is considerable evidence that drones, including stealthy uncrewed combat air vehicles (UCAV), will make up a substantial part of Sichuan's air wing. Earlier this year, apparent mockups of the GJ-11 Sharp Sword UCAV, or variants or derivatives thereof, appeared at a test and/or training site right on Changxing Island near where the Type 076 has been being built. A pair of apparent GJ-11 mockups at a test and/or training site on Changxing Island in Shanghai in May 2024. Google Earth There remain no indications, at least publicly, that China is pursuing crewed short or vertical takeoff and landing capable tactical jets that would be well suited for operations from a ship like the Type 076. Other lighter crewed types could potentially operate from Sichuan in addition to drones. Helicopters, crewed and uncrewed, will primarily make use of the design's ample deck space, as well. The event today also offers a better view of Sichuan's twin island configuration, another feature optimized for aviation operations. Having two distinct islands allows for one to be dedicated to navigation and other ship operations-related tasks, while the other is focused on flight operations. A drone-heavy air wing presents additional demands when it comes to managing aircraft on the flight deck and in the air, which only increases the value of having a physical structure centered purely on aviation activities. A look at Sichuan's two islands during today's ceremony. Chinese Internet Britain's Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers notably have a twin island arrangement for the same general reasons. India’s future aircraft carrier Vishal may have a similar configuration. Italy's Trieste amphibious warfare ship, a closer analog to the Type 076, also has two islands. The U.K. Royal Navy’s aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth features characteristic twin island superstructures. Crown Copyright The Royal Navy's new aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth will arrive in Gibraltar today for her first overseas port visit. Image by Dave Jenkins via Wikimedia Commons, CC-BY-2.0 However, the imagery from the ceremony also confirms that the Type 076 has a rear well deck for launching and recovering landing craft. It had been unclear whether or not the design would be aviation-centric like the first two examples of the U.S. America class and omit this feature. A view of Sichuan's stern showing the top of the door covering the ship's well deck. Chinese Internet In addition, the new views of Sichuan highlight the ship's substantial close-in defense capabilities, including at least three HQ-10 surface-to-air missile launchers (two at the stern and on one top of the forward island), at least three Type 1130 close-in weapon systems (two on each side of the hull and one at the stern), and what looks to be four 32-tube defensive launchers (two on each side of the hull). The HQ-10 is a rough analog to the launchers for the RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) found on U.S. Navy and other western warships, and is designed to provide the same close-in protection against incoming cruise missiles and other aerial threats, as well as potentially some small surface ones. The Type 1130 is a gun-based system designed to provide another layer of close-in defense with its 30mm Gatling-type cannon. Defensive launchers on Chinese warships can reportedly be loaded with decoy flares, cartridges full of radar-scattering chaff, and active decoys equipped with small radiofrequency jammers, which can be used to confuse seekers on enemy missiles, as well rockets with small depth charges to engage submarines and combat divers. A view of the port stern corner of the Type 076 showing examples of, from left to right, a 32-tube defensive launcher, an HQ-10 surface-to-air missile launcher, and a Type 1130 close-in weapon system. Chinese Internet This is a significant array of active defenses compared to what is found on many big-deck amphibious assault ships and even some light aircraft carriers. The Type 076's defensive capabilities might also be further bolstered by electronic warfare and electronic support measure systems. Overall, the Type 076 represents a significant new naval capability for the PLAN. As TWZ has written previously: 'The potential value to the PLAN of having a fleet of very large deck amphibious assault ships that are highly capable of large-scale drone operations as well as traditional amphibious assaults is clear. These ships could be used to launch and recover UCAVs like the GJ-11 and other types of drones to perform a host of missions from maritime strike to intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). They could be used to provide additional ‘mass’ in support of the operations of larger carrier strike groups and help to free the air wings of flattops like Fujian up for tasks they might be better suited for. In addition, they could provide a lower tier of naval aviation support that could be employed independently.' &#8230; 'Simply having more naval aviation capacity overall would give the PLAN added flexibility for various operations closer to the mainland, including a potential military intervention against Taiwan or defending its expansive and largely unrecognized territorial claims in places like the South China Sea. Type 076s could also help project naval and air power further from China’s shores, something that has also been a driving factor behind the country’s broader carrier ambitions.' &#8230; 'The Type 076 could help provide support during humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations. Big deck amphibious warfare ships, in general, provide their operators with immensely valuable platforms for projecting both hard and soft power.' Chinese Internet The Pentagon's most recent annual report on Chinese military developments, which it released earlier this month, underscores these assessments. The 'ship will likely use a hybrid electric propulsion system and have electromagnetic catapults (EMALS) for launching large maritime UAVs [uncrewed aerial vehicles] for strike and ISR missions' and will be able to 'provide additional sea control via catapult-launched UAVs,' the report says at various points. The Type 076 further reflects China's substantial shipbuilding capacity and the speed with which it is increasingly capable of producing very large warships. Sichuan underscores broader efforts by China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) to modernize and otherwise expand its capabilities across all domains, as well. Altogether, while the Type 076 still does not look to have been truly launched just yet, that milestone looks increasingly imminent and significant progress clearly continues to be made toward actually delivering the ship to the PLAN.

Yes, China Just Flew Another Tailless Next-Generation Stealth Com...	It appears that another new Chinese combat aircraft has already entered flight testing, and it is also an advanced, stealthy, tailless design. The imagery of the previously unseen aircraft began to circulate on social media today, only a matter of hours after the first appearance of a remarkable diamond-shaped, tailless, heavy tactical combat aircraft design which you can read more about in our initial analysis piece here. A video and several photos of the second, apparently smaller aircraft began to emerge today and, so far at least, they are fewer in number and of inferior quality, making it harder to determine particular details. pic.twitter.com/BKHGVbRIbn&mdash; OedoSoldier (@OedoSoldier) December 26, 2024 Before we continue, it’s important to note that so far this imagery looks remarkably legitimate. That is not to say that it’s verified authentic at this time. There remains the possibility it has been fabricated, but also considering the timing with the other reveal, that seems increasingly unlikely. According to unconfirmed accounts, the second combat aircraft design is from the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation (SAC), while the first, larger design is from the rival Chengdu Aircraft Corporation (CAC). While Shenyang is responsible for the production of Chinese developments of the Flanker multirole fighter family and the medium-weight J-35 stealth fighter family, Chengdu builds the J-10 multirole medium fighter and the heavy J-20 stealth fighter. The second tactical jet aircraft design was shown in some of the photos being ‘chased’ by a Flanker-series fighter, perhaps a two-seat J-16, which would lend further support to the idea that it’s a Shenyang product. A rear-aspect view of the reported Shenyang combat aircraft design. From this angle, a prominent flight-test data probe can be seen on the nose. via X via X While the Chengdu design has a modified diamond-delta wing planform, with extended wing-root ‘chines,’’ the Shenyang aircraft has a relatively sharply swept wing, although this is hardly conventional, being more in line with a ‘lambda’ wing profile. This platform creates prominent triangular-shaped trailing-edge extensions that taper back from roughly the mid-point in the wing, and which project out beyond the engine exhausts. Unlike the apparent new Chengdu design, which is understood to have a three-engine powerplant, the Shenyang design is a more conventional twin-engine aircraft, in keeping also with its smaller size. The engines appear to be fed by what seem to be diverterless supersonic inlet (DSI) intakes on either side of the forward fuselage, below the wing root, and which look to be very angular in shape. The apparent Shenyang combat aircraft design seen from below. via X Two engine nozzles are evident, with some kind of a protuberance between them. From the available angles, it’s not immediately clear if the aircraft has a cockpit. While it would make sense for it to be a part of China’s crewed combat aircraft development path, it could also be a drone or an optionally crewed aircraft. The fuselage is somewhat angular, and deep, suggesting a diamond-shaped cross-section, which would offer a blend of low observability and useful internal capacity for fuel and weapons. Two views of the apparent new Shenyang combat aircraft alongside what looks to be a J-16 chase plane. via X via X The Shenyang design also has a more standard-looking tricycle landing gear, with single wheels on each main unit, while the Chengdu design uses more robust twin-wheel bogies on the main gear to accommodate its larger size and gross weight. Neither of the two designs features any kind of vertical or horizontal tail surfaces. This is entirely in keeping with what we expected of China’s next-generation fighter designs, with tailless concepts having previously appeared in the form of various studies as well as a mysterious tailless vehicle that appeared in satellite images at Chengdu in October 2021. Tailless designs are something we have previously discussed in depth before, in relation to future Chinese fighters, but it’s worth noting that the main advantage they confer is in terms of broadband low observability against a variety of radar types operating across multiple frequencies. At the same time, the radar signature, especially from the side and rear perspectives, will also be reduced significantly. The new ‘heavy’ Chinese combat aircraft alongside a J-20S chase plane. The new design, like the J-20, is thought to be a Chengdu product. via X Two more views of the new ‘heavy’ Chinese combat aircraft, perhaps designated J-36. via X Other advantages of a tailless design include reduced aerodynamic drag, which provides improved performance for sustained high-speed dashes and cruising flight. Additional beneficial factors will almost certainly include a large internal volume for the carriage of fuel and weapons — critical for extended combat radius and persistence on-station, two key concerns in the Asia Pacific theater. At the same time, a tailless configuration can adversely affect overall stability and maneuverability, requiring advanced fly-by-wire digital flight control technology to simply keep it in the air. One feature that could help mitigate stability and maneuverability deficiencies would involve thrust-vectoring engines, something China has tested in the past. Without a good view from the rear, it’s impossible to say for certain, but the nozzles could conceivably feature F-22-style two-dimensional thrust-vectoring. Unconfirmed reports suggest that the Shenyang design is a prototype fighter and made its first flight on December 20 this year. Another view of the apparent Shenyang combat aircraft design from below. Test flights performed over populated areas suggest no great desire to hide the aircraft from prying eyes. via X However, it seems that Beijing very deliberately ensured that the two new designs broke cover today, for maximum impact. This would make sense given that December 26 is the birthdate of Mao Zedong, the founder of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). It is also exactly 13 years to the day that the J-20 first broke cover. At this point, it’s worth noting that in both cases, we cannot currently confirm the identities of the manufacturers or even the intended roles of the new aircraft. So far, there have been no official comments from the Chinese government or industry, although internal security services certainly appear to have let imagery be leaked via unofficial channels and it’s also notable that these test flights were documented in the daytime. As we have discussed before, the design now thought to be from Chengdu is notably large, suggesting that it could possibly be related to the so-called JH-XX. This is described by U.S. intelligence officials as a regional bomber, with a shorter range, smaller payload capacity, and more of tactical focus than the H-20 stealth bomber. The H-20 is being developed by the Xi’an Aircraft Corporation (XAC) and is widely expected to be a flying-wing type aircraft, like the B-2 and B-21. The JH-XX remains a very shadowy project, but you can read more about what is known here. A picture that has previously emerged showing a model of a design that might be tied to work on the JH-XX. Chinese Internet In the past, we have also suggested that the JH-XX ‘bomber’ could finally emerge as something closer to a ‘fighter-bomber’: 'The design could prioritize speed, as well as stealth, too. This could give the smaller fighter-bomber added advantages when it comes to sortie rates and for successfully penetrating through an enemy’s integrated air defense network. Above all else, it allows for multi-role operations, including supporting long-range air-to-air missions, without a heavy reliance on vulnerable tankers or even the use of coastal airfields, which would be the most vulnerable to attack during an all-out conflict.' While the new three-engine design could be related to the JH-XX, it could also be a more generic demonstrator intended to test a variety of combat aircraft technologies. It could also be a more heavyweight fighter being developed under China’s next-generation airpower initiative. Speaking to TWZ, Chinese aerospace observer and author Andreas Rupprecht explained that his assessment is that we are seeing combat aircraft demonstrators from Shenyang and Chengdu and that these are both closer aligned to fighters rather than bombers. 'Using the sixth-generation description is perhaps a little too hasty, but I think we are at the point where we can really say the Chinese have shown us for the first time their idea of air combat and new-generation fighters,' Rupprecht said. Certainly, China now appears to be flying two different very advanced combat aircraft designs, which could also be rivals, with one being smaller than its competitor, which would have certain advantages in terms of cost, complexity, and performance. They could also be intended to complement one another as a ‘medium/heavy’ future manned fighter combat mix. This latter would parallel China’s pursuit of the single-engine J-10 and the twin-engine J-11/16 series, followed by the co-development of the medium-weight J-35 and the larger J-20 stealth fighters. At one stage, it looked like the J-35 would be primarily aimed at export customers, as well as for Chinese naval use, but a Chinese land-based version is now also known to be in development.

Photo by Wang Jingtian/VCG via Getty Images A Shenyang J-35 stealth fighter. Chinese Internet Chinese Internet What we do know is that China has an active sixth-generation fighter program. It would not be surprising for more than one flying demonstrator design to be built to support it, or even prototypes much closer to planned production aircraft. Whether China plans to introduce more than one sixth-generation fighter, or simply determine what kind of design best suits its needs, there are plenty of signs that the country is fully committed to a future air combat program, which will include a crewed fighter as well as complementary drones, and also the JH-XX, which may well be being developed as part of the same ‘ecosystem,’ perhaps even sharing certain subsystems and technologies. The H-20 could also form part of this same broader airpower architecture. The previous boss of Air Combat Command, Gen. Mark D. Kelly, spoke in September 2022 about China’s future fighter program, noting that it was likely to follow a ‘system of systems’ approach similar to the one that the U.S. Air Force has been pursuing and would certainly include a sixth-generation crewed fighter. Gen. Kelly also said he expected the platform — or platforms — to emerge with an 'exponential' improvement in stealth compared with current Chinese aircraft. Of course, a tailless design could help achieve this. An artist’s impression of a generic U.S. Air Force tailless sixth-generation crewed fighter, of the kind being developed under the NGAD initiative. Collins Aerospace Collins Aerospace Notably, the U.S. military’s latest annual report to Congress on Chinese military developments, an unclassified version of which was released on December 18, doesn’t mention potential sixth-generation crewed fighter developments. Chinese officials, meanwhile, have given very little away about the country’s future tactical air combat program. However, in a 2019 interview, Wang Haifeng, chief designer for CAC, described a project that aimed for service entry around 2035. That would also seem to be broadly in keeping with the first flight of a Chengdu demonstrator around now. In the past, Andreas Rupprecht told TWZ that: 'Allegedly, since 2018, CAC and its related 611 Institute have been working on the development of key technologies for the next-generation fighter.' As well as testing for future crewed combat aircraft, China is already heavily engaged in developing various supporting technologies. These include the ability for future crewed combat jets to team with drones, and the use of artificial intelligence, as well as advanced sensors and weapons that will be brought together as part of China’s broader future air combat architecture. While the appearance of one new-generation Chinese combat aircraft design is notable, the apparent emergence of two different such designs in a single day would truly be a milestone. Today’s developments should also be seen in light of the U.S. Air Force’s equivalent Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative, which includes its crewed sixth-generation stealth combat jet. A final decision on this has now been pushed to the incoming Trump administration, amid uncertainty about the Air Force’s ability to pay for NGAD. At the same time, questions have been increasingly asked about the relevance of NGAD in a future high-end combat scenario. A rendering of a notional U.S. tailless sixth-generation crewed fighter, refueling in flight. Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin It will be some time before we get a better understanding of the precise roles and attributes of China’s new combat aircraft designs. However, the country is clearly already committed to developing successors to its current combat aircraft fleet and appears to be looking at how best to achieve significant advances in terms of range, payload, speed, and low observability. While it’s still unclear what China’s next-generation fighter or fighters will end up looking like, and how they might be related to the JH-XX ‘fighter-bomber,’ the current pace of development puts the uncertainty around the U.S. Air Force’s NGAD efforts into even sharper focus.

Anti-Drone Weapon With 24 Barrels Firing Buckshot-Like Rounds Eme...	Russian forces have begun using improvised counter-drone buggies each armed with a weapon made up of 24 barrels that fire shotgun-like ammunition, as well as six AK-series infantry rifles on a single mount. The cluster of shot-firing barrels highlights how shotguns have become a go-to option for both sides of the conflict in Ukraine to help provide local defense against uncrewed aerial threats, but also the limitations of those weapons in this role. A video from the Russian Ministry of Defense, seen below, shows a pair of the new counter-drone vehicles.

Ukrainian soldiers test the effects of shotgun cartridges on attacking FPV drones.Apparently knocking down an FPV with a shotgun is a challenge. pic.twitter.com/UIa4jbigNb&mdash; Roy (@GrandpaRoy2) December 12, 2024 'A shotgun does not penetrate, does not damage the FPV drone,' a Ukrainian service member says at one point in the video. 'He hit the antenna [on the drone], but it didn't stop him anyway,' another individual says in the clip. Firing a burst of shotgun shells at once from a cluster of barrels could help maximize total damage to the target, as well as increase the overall likelihood of scoring hits. However, the effective range of typical buckshot shotgun ammunition, as well as its penetrative capabilities at longer distances, has long been a limiting factor in the battlefield use of shotguns broadly speaking. As a prime example of this, the U.S. military's abortive late Cold War-era Close Assault Weapon System (CAWS) combat shotgun program notably also involved the development of new ammunition types to try to provide better terminal effects at extended ranges. The War Zone more recently highlighted exactly these issues after the U.S. Marine Corps expressed interest earlier this year in the possibility of acquiring shotgun pellet-like ammunition for its standard service rifles to help defend against drones. New specialized ammunition could still be a way to improve the utility of shotguns and other small arms against drones.

The U.S. military, among others, has been fielding computerized gun sights on a limited level to help individual shooters better engage uncrewed aerial threats. The Marine Corps has also at least tested another counter-drone system for existing standard infantry rifles that includes an automatically moving buttstock, as you can read more about here.

USMC When it comes to the 24-barrel weapon on the new Russian counter-drone vehicles, there is also a question of how quickly and easily that system can be reloaded after firing. It is important to stress that multiple layers of capabilities would offer the best defense against drones, even just localized attacks by smaller kamikaze types. What the optimal mix of anti-drone systems might be remains a hot topic of debate globally. Options that incorporate guns do look set to be part of that ecosystem for the foreseeable future. Shotguns and other weapons that fire similar pellet-filled ammunition, like the one that has now emerged on the Russian counter-drone buggies, are still very much in the mix when it comes to protecting against uncrewed aerial threats despite questions about their overall utility.

What We Know About the Azerbaijan Airliner That Crashed In Kazakh...	Azerbaijan Airlines Flight JS-8432 crashed in Kazakhstan Wednesday after being fired upon by a Russian Pantsir S1 short-range air defense system, the head of Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR) told The War Zone, while a U.S. official told us that a Russian anti-aircraft system may have struck the aircraft. These claims line up with video emerging from inside the jet and the crash scene as well as reporting by several news outlets indicating the Russian air defense system caused the crash of the Embraer 190 passenger jet that killed 38. The War Zone cannot independently verify these claims while several investigations are underway and Russian, Azerbainanian and Kazakh officials urge restraint in reaching conclusions about the crash. Video taken by a passenger before the crash reportedly showed 'shrapnel holes in the fuselage, consistent with damage from a Russian surface-to-air missile,' according to the Twitter account of the Azeri Times news outlet. 'The footage also shows a woman bleeding from her leg, wounded by shrapnel.'

Gen. Kyrylo Budanov told us. Citing four sources close to the Azerbaijani investigation, Reuters reported that the jet was downed by Russian air defense 'after diverting from an area of Russia in which Moscow has used air defense systems against Ukrainian drone strikes in recent months.' Euronews, citing 'Azerbaijani government sources' reported that 'a Russian surface-to-air missile caused the Azerbaijan Airlines plane crash in Aktau on Wednesday.' 'According to the sources, the missile was fired at Flight 8432 during drone air activity above Grozny, and the shrapnel hit the passengers and cabin crew as it exploded next to the aircraft mid-flight,' the publication reported. 'Government sources have told Euronews that the damaged aircraft was not allowed to land at any Russian airports despite the pilots’ requests for an emergency landing, and it was ordered to fly across the Caspian Sea towards Aktau in Kazakhstan. According to data, the plane’s GPS navigation systems were jammed throughout the flight path above the sea.' Aktau is nearly 300 miles east of Grozny. The stricken jet flew nearly 300 miles east, including nearly 190 miles over the Caspian Sea. (Google Earth) The airliner, with 67 people on board, was due to fly to Grozny in Russia's Chechen Republic but it was diverted because of fog, the airline said, according to the BBC. 'A surviving passenger told Russian TV he believed the pilot had tried twice to land in dense fog over Grozny before 'the third time, something exploded&#8230; some of the aircraft skin had blown out,'' the network reported.

'The Russian dispatcher said that the aircraft was experiencing a failure in its control systems and that the crew decided to fly to Aktau after receiving reports of bad weather, Karabayev said,' according to CNN. 'The dispatcher later said that an 'oxygen tank exploded in the passenger cabin, causing passengers to lose consciousness,' according to Karabayev. While the Azerbaijan Airlines crew made two landing approaches at Aktau airport, the aircraft deviated from its course, and lost communication with Aktau dispatchers when it crashed, Karabayev said.' The flight-tracking website Flightradar24 reported that the plane set off on Wednesday at 7:55 a.m. Azerbaijan Standard Time (AST) and crashed at 10:28 a.m. AST. 'The aircraft was exposed to strong GPS jamming which made the aircraft transmit bad ADS-B data. At (8:40 a.m. AST) we lost the ADS-B signal,' Flightradar24 concluded.

After reportedly being damaged by the Russian SAM, the jet's communications systems were 'completely paralyzed' by Russian electronic warfare systems, according to Caliber. 'This disruption caused the aircraft to disappear from radar within Russian airspace and only reappeared in the area of the Caspian Sea.' Caliber added that according to Russian sources, 'at the time of the flight over Chechnya, Russian air defense systems were attempting to shoot down Ukrainian drones. The head of the Security Council of the Chechen Republic, Khamzat Kadyrov, confirmed the drone attack on Grozny on the morning of December 25, stating that there were no casualties or damage. In this case, the Russian side should have closed its airspace to civilian aircraft, but this was not done. Why a no-fly zone was not declared over Chechnya remains a significant question.' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned against jumping to conclusions that the Russians fired at the jet. 'It would be wrong to put forward any hypotheses before the investigation's conclusions,' he argued. 'We, of course, will not do this, and no one should do this. We need to wait until the investigation is completed.' A regional Kazakh official appeared to acknowledge Thursday that the investigation is looking into whether Russian air defenses downed the plane but said it is too soon to offer a definitive assessment. Mangystau Regional Transport Prosecutor Abylaibek Ordabayev said they have not yet come to any conclusions about whether that played a role, Reuters reported. Azerbaijanian President Ilham Aliyev said he learned of the crash while he was flying to Russia to attend the informal summit of the heads of state of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) member countries in St. Petersburg on Dec. 25. He promptly ordered his plane to return to Baku and ordered a criminal investigation of the crash. Like the Russians and Kazakhs, he urged caution before determining the cause. 'The commission's task is to fully investigate the matter, examine the causes of the crash and all its details, and provide information both to me and to the Azerbaijani public,' he said. 'According to the information provided to me, the AZAL airline plane, flying on the Baku-Grozny route, changed its course due to worsening weather conditions and began heading toward Aktau airport, where the crash occurred during landing. There are videos of the plane crash available in the media and on social networks, and everyone can watch them. However, the reasons for the crash are not yet known to us. There are various theories, but I believe it is premature to discuss them. The matter must be thoroughly investigated. A criminal case has been launched by the Prosecutor General's Office, and naturally, the Azerbaijani public will be regularly informed about both the results of the commission's work and the progress of the criminal case.' That anyone survived the crash at all is amazing in itself. It speaks volumes about the pilots' ability to fly the stricken jet for nearly 300 miles, including nearly 190 miles over a large body of water, reportedly with disrupted communications and likely by using thrust to help the flight because the left horizontal stabilizer was reportedly rendered inoperable by the shrapnel. Captain Igor Kshnyakin, co-pilot Aleksandr Kalyaninov and purser Hokuma Aliyeva were killed in the crash, according to Euronews, while the other two flight attendants, Zulfugar Asadov and Aidan Rahimli, reportedly survived and were being treated in hospital on Thursday. The crew was hailed as heroes for their ability to maintain flight and keep the passengers relatively calm. Kshnyakin and Kalyaninov 'displayed remarkable airmanship, according to experts, as they managed to fly the stricken plane across the Caspian Sea and crash landing just 3 kilometers short of the Aktau airport runway,' Euronews noted. In a Tweet, the airline provided a list of the crew and passengers on the aircraft.

In September 2016, a Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team tasked with figuring out what happened to Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) on July 17th, 2014 concluded that a SA-11 Buk surface-to-air missile system downed the hapless airliner, and that weapon was sent into Ukraine from Russia and removed shortly after the engagement. The site where the missile was fired has also been officially pinpointed as just outside the village of Pervomaiskyi, which was held by pro-Russian forces at the time. After the shootdown, in which all 298 lives aboard MH17 were lost, the Buk system was quickly moved back into Russian territory the next day, according to the report 'After the BUK missile had been fired, the BUK-TELAR initially drove off under its own power,' the report concluded. 'A short time later it was reloaded onto the Volvo truck and transported back to the Russian border. During the night, the convoy crossed the border into the territory of the Russian Federation.' There have been several relatively recent cases where air defenses, under pressure of an ongoing or possibly impending attack, have taken down the wrong aircraft. Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752, a Boeing 737-800, crashed shortly after taking off from Tehran Imam Khomeini International Airport at approximately 6:12 AM local time on Jan. 8, 2020 after being struck by two Iranian air defense missiles. The flight was heading to the Ukrainian capital Kyiv and had 176 crew and passengers on board, all of whom died in the subsequent crash. Video footage that subsequently emerged showed the plane engulfed in a fireball before it hit the ground. The shootdown immediately followed an unprecedented Iranian missile strike targeting U.S. forces in Iraq and Iranian air defenses were on extreme alert anticipating the country would be hit in retaliation. You can read more about that here. Rescue workers carry the body of a victim of a Ukrainian plane crash. On January 8th, 2020 Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 was scheduled to depart from Tehran to Canada via Kyiv. The Boeing 737-800 was shot down shortly after taking off from Imam Khomeini International Airport by two missiles fired by the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). All 176 passengers and crew were perished. (Photo by Javad / Middle East Images / Middle East Images via AFP) JAVAD More recently, a U.S. Navy F/A-18F Super Hornet was accidentally shot down by a missile fired by the U.S. Navy Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Gettysburg over the Red Sea. The jet, downed early on December 22 local time, was returning to the aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman during the middle of what a U.S. official told The War Zone was a complex attack. 'After successfully returning from its initial mission, an F/A-18F launched again to provide air defense support from OWAs and ASCMs that were inbound to the force,' a U.S. official told us. 'They were shot down while recovery of remaining aircraft was underway.' According to Fox News, a second Super Hornet narrowly avoided being struck by a missile from the Gettysburg. It may take a while before a definitive conclusion can be reached about what happened to Azerbaijan Airlines Flight JS-8432. However, preliminary reports seem to indicate that once again, neither anti-aircraft systems nor the people operating them, are infallible in the heat of battle.

China Stuns With Heavy Stealth Tactical Jet’s Sudden Appearance	In something of a stunning development, China appears to already be flying a stealthy, high-performance, flying-wing, sixth-generation crewed combat aircraft, imagery of which began to emerge today. At this early stage, we have very little idea about the precise identity of the new aircraft, but many elements of its design are very much in line with what we already knew about Chinese sixth-generation airpower aspirations. pic.twitter.com/IZ9BlwjoOc&mdash; Justin Bronk (@Justin_Br0nk) December 26, 2024 第三圈 pic.twitter.com/GvKReHJ3sm&mdash; 東風 (@eastwind6699) December 26, 2024 Video and photos that began to circulate today on social media show the previously unseen aircraft conducting a daytime test flight, alongside a two-seat Chengdu J-20S fighter, serving as a chase plane. The locations and the dates of the various imagery cannot be verified at this stage, although the presence of the J-20 suggests that the Chengdu Aircraft Corporation (CAC) factory airfield is a likely candidate. The new Chinese combat aircraft accompanied by a J-20S chase plane. via X via X There has also been no official comment from the Chinese Ministry of Defense or state media so far. Aside from the sheer size of the new aircraft, which we will address in a moment, the most striking thing about it is its planform and tailless configuration. It has a modified delta wing with chine lines emanating all the way to the nose area, while its central fuselage section, at least the bottom of it, is loosely reminiscent of the J-20. The broad nose could even provide space for side-by-side crew seating, although the limited views of the canopy mean we cannot be sure whether the aircraft has a single-seat or two-seat arrangement, with tandem twin seats being another option. via X via X via X There was already growing evidence pointing to the fact that China’s next fighter would be tailless, and designs of this kind had previously appeared in the form of technical studies. Back in October 2021, a mysterious tailless aircraft shape appeared in satellite images of a CAC factory airfield. It was a large modified-diamond-like delta planform with a relatively thin nose section; it also had a significant wingspan — broadly similar to that of a J-20. But it's worth noting that this shape does not look the same as the aircraft we are seeing. Beyond that, next-generation tactical combat aircraft eschewing traditional tails is a major design driver being pursued by the U.S., as well. This is predominantly to significantly reduce the aircraft's radar signature across multiple bands and from all aspects. There are some aerodynamic efficiencies also to be had with such a design, especially one used for long-range operations via a reduction in aerodynamic drag, which should provide better performance for sustained high-speed dashes and cruising flight. At the same time, a tailless configuration can adversely affect overall maneuverability, even with the most advanced computerized flight control systems. There are currently no signs of thrust-vectoring engines on this aircraft, which would help enhance agility and overall stability. The engine exhausts are mounted in the best place to mask the aircraft's infrared signature, atop the rear of its fuselage.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION While a tailless configuration, size, general shaping, and exhaust layout point directly toward a design tailored for stealth and endurance, it’s not entirely clear the exact level of enhanced low observability this new aircraft might offer. But just deleting the tail surfaces and strakes and providing a more general aerodynamic clean-up, while leveraging the same now nearly 15-year-old technology found on the the J-20, for example, would still be a massive improvement. Clearly, this aircraft incorporates significantly greater low observable technologies that are a leap ahead of the J-20, beyond its tailless design. Also notable is the elaborate arrangement of control surfaces coupled with the tailless design, with five trailing edge control surfaces per wing. These include prominent split flaps close to the wingtips. These would be used differentially to provide yaw control in the absence of tail control surfaces, as well as deploying simultaneously to serve as air brakes. via X In terms of size, the new aircraft can be compared to the J-20 — the imagery suggests it is at least as long. The J-20 is close to 70 feet from nose to tail. In this regard, this design's twin-wheel main landing gear is also worth noting, providing another pointer to the considerable weight of the aircraft. Above all, its large size would seem to reflect an overarching concern with long endurance with comparatively massive internal volume to accommodate a very large fuel load, as well as weapons and sensors.

Photo by Wang Jingtian/VCG via Getty Images Maybe the aircraft's most unusual feature is its air intake arrangement. It appears to have an air intake on top of the fuselage, as well as twin intakes on either side of the lower fuselage. This has already led to speculation that the aircraft may have a highly unorthodox three-engine arrangement. Unconfirmed rumors point to a powerplant comprising three domestically produced WS-10C turbofans, as used in the J-20. Considering the aircraft's higher gross weight than the J-20, three engines may be necessary in order to meet aggressive performance goals, especially for sustained high-speed flight and operations at high altitudes. Three it is. pic.twitter.com/3nSa3hFWeM&mdash; Mike Pryce (@MichaelJPryce) December 26, 2024 That China has been working on a sixth-generation combat aircraft program is also no surprise. Back in September 2022, Gen. Mark D. Kelly, who was then the head of Air Combat Command (ACC), said that China was working on the same kind of air combat ‘system of systems’ that the U.S. Air Force is pursuing under its Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative, including a sixth-generation manned fighter jet. At the time, Kelly noted that China saw sixth-generation air power, including future manned fighter aircraft, 'greatly the way we see it: an exponential reduction in signature, exponential acceleration of processing power and sensing.' Another key factor would be the ability to 'iterate' improvements aided by open mission systems, Kelly added. via X via X Regarding a potential successor to the J-20, Gen. Kelly warned that China 'are not dummies. They know what they’re doing.' Kelly also said he expected the Chinese sixth-generation air combat program to include an 'exponential' improvement in stealth compared with current platforms. At this early stage, it’s far from clear whether the new aircraft is a prototype sixth-generation fighter, or perhaps a more generalized demonstrator that will test new technologies that could potentially end up on a variety of different platforms, including a large tactical aircraft much like it. It seems almost certain that China, for some time now, has been engaged in preliminary testing of different manned fighter configurations. This development work may also include demonstrators, both sub-scale and full-size, and the new aircraft may well be related to it. via X The aircraft could also be related to a new regional stealth bomber aircraft, which could potentially be a crewed component tied to the broader Chinese sixth-generation airpower initiative. The regional bomber program, known as JH-XX, remains very secretive, but you can read more about what is known about that project here. Previously, it was thought that the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation might be working on the JH-XX, in which case a J-20 chase plane, from the rival Chengdu, would seem less likely. But more likely, at least at this time, this aircraft could be more closely tied to China's version of America's Next Generation Air Dominance initiative, which aimed to develop a similar manned heavy 'fighter'-like aircraft that would work just as much as a command and control node for drones as a classic fighter. Range, sustained speed in cruise, weapons payload, and low observability are all thought to be top priorities of the manned fighter component of NGAD, or at least were. The fighter element of the program is now on hold and still may be canceled entirely, or end up looking very different, under the Trump administration. The fact that this exotic aircraft was flying during the day, in an area where it was seemingly easily photographed also tells a lot about the program's status. It is very likely China intended for this to be seen at this time. Overall, while so much remains unknown, what we can say about this aircraft definitively is that it's a large, very heavy, tactical jet that has had a massive premium put on combat radios and survivability. High altitude operations are also likely a feature of this design, especially if it does indeed feature three engines. But above all else, it should be able to fly over long regional distances and loiter for extended periods on station far from home without tanker support — something China lacks in terms of capacity versus the United States. In other words, it can put targets in the air, on the ground, and at sea at risk in areas where they won't expect a threat from a manned combat aircraft, at least based on China's current inventory. This has real implications for American tankers, airlifters, and reconnaissance aircraft, as well as allied ships and forces operating at forward locales. It would serve as a critical force-multiplying sensor platform operating far forward. Paired with drone wingmen of relevant endurance, its lethality and survivability would be multiplied. In other words, the existence of this aircraft is a very big deal.

U.S. Navy Ship Menus From Christmases Past	Man, is it just me or did Christmas sneak up FAST this year? Is that just a function of getting older? Remember the anticipation as a kid, the countdown that began right after Halloween? Alas, so it goes. Either way, another Christmas is once again upon us. We are grateful to have you all along for the ride. And no matter what’s going on in your life, we hope you enjoy a day of rest and rejuvenation, far away from the demands of the other 364 days of the year. So let’s celebrate with some choice dinner menus from Navy ships during yules past. We’ve even got a longtime TWZ reader chipping in with a menu (thanks, Sean!) Thanks as well to the U.S. Naval Historical and Heritage Command for assembling these culinary time capsules. Merry Christmas and happy holidays. Please stay fed. USS Oregon (BB-3) 1917 Aren't all olives we eat technically ripe? (U.S. Navy) The ship: The Indiana class battleship was commissioned in 1898 and found adventure on the high seas before being decommissioned in 1920. 'Oregon made a dramatic voyage during the Spanish-American war, weathering storms, while encountering harsh gales while passing through the Straits of Magellan, arriving 66 days after she departed,' a Navy history recounts. 'This journey gave evidence for building the Panama Canal as it would be prudent for the United States not to wait again for this transit if emergencies arose.' The good: Potato croquettes are a criminally underrated Potato Delivery Vehicle (PDV), and lemon meringue pie really deserves more of the pie spotlight. The not so good: 'Cluster raisins' sounds like when you open a box of raisins and they’re all stuck together. USS Monterey (BM-6) 1918 That's a tasty menu. (U.S. Navy) The ship: The only ship of its class, Monterey was commissioned in 1893 and soon took on missions that were bigger than what the monitor platform (it literally looks like a platform too!) was envisioned for. 'Though not designed for extended ocean cruising, the big monitor departed San Diego 11 June in company with collier Brutus for Manila,' a Navy history states. 'Sailing via Honolulu and Apra, Guam, the two ships made the 8,000‑mile voyage without mishap, arriving 13 August, and Monterey remained in the Philippines supporting the occupation of Luzon into 1899.' The good: Buttered asparagus tips and grape juice punch. I wonder what grape juice punch tasted like in the days before artificial flavoring. The not so good: Seaman Timmy appears to have typo’d up this menu. If not, the mess should have gone to mast for serving roast turkey with tartar sauce and baked red snapper with giblet gravy. USS Colorado (BB-45) 1926 Scary Santa. (U.S. Navy) The ship: A grand old dame of the fleet by the time World War II broke out, a Navy history nonetheless notes how Colorado did her part: 'In November 1943, Colorado took part in the Tarawa invasion. She supported the landings at Kwajalein and Eniwetok in January and February 1944 and the Marianas operation in June and July. On 24 July 1944, while bombarding Tinian, she was hit by enemy shore batteries, suffering serious casualties among exposed personnel topside.' 'Colorado's next combat duty was off Leyte in November 1944, where she was hit by two ‘Kamikaze’ suicide planes late in the month. Remaining in the combat zone, she supported the Mindoro invasion in December and the Lingayen Gulf landings in January. During March, April and May 1945, Colorado's sixteen-inch guns bombarded Okinawa in support of U.S. troops ashore. In August and September 1945, she covered the occupation of Japan, then departed for the United States.' The good: Pickled eggs are lowkey the best bar/drinking food out there, and cold pork or ham is pure Christmas. The not so good: The menu cover is kind of terrifying, and those two tykes do not look excited to see Ol’ Saint Nick. USS Bridge (AF-1) 1936 Eating good on USS Bridge. The ship: A humble provisions stores ship that helped keep troops supplied during the invasion of Okinawa in 1945. The good: Cauliflower a la parmesan seems ahead of its time, despite the fact that cauliflower is timelessly adaptable and delicious. Also the most aesthetically pleasing menu cover in our collection. The not so good: We discussed this before, but saltines have no right to be a featured player on any holiday menu. USS Lawrence C. Taylor (DE-415) 1945 Reader Sean's Christmas menu that his uncle and family kept for nearly 80 years. The ship (and the contributor): You already know that TWZ has the best readers out there, and that our comments section is without peer. So we’re pleased to share this next entry, submitted by longtime reader Sean, whose uncle served on this John C. Butler class destroyer escort during World War II. It has been passed down by his family through the decades and we are proud to now render it online immortality. 'Menu came from my family member Howard Eiss, who was the sailor on the ship,' Sean told TWZ. 'To the best of my knowledge, this was passed down in the family and I came about it only a few years ago.' The good: Sean keeping this priceless piece of family history for years to come; old-fashioned fruit cake. The not so good: Celery en Branch sounds like the mess got a tad lazy. Still, the ship and its crew had fought hard throughout the Pacific during the war, and had earned this feast by Xmas ‘45. Merry Christmas, everyone!

New Coast Guard Heavy Icebreaker Construction Finally Underway	The construction of the first Polar Security Cutter (PSC) heavy icebreaker for the U.S. Coast Guard is now formally proceeding. Though the milestone is important, it also underscores the PSC program's already massive delays. The first of these new icebreakers was originally supposed to have been delivered this year and may not now arrive until 2029. The Coast Guard is sorely in need of more heavy icebreakers, with only one such ship, which is aging and increasingly hard to maintain, in its current fleet. The Integrated Program Office for the PSC, which the Coast Guard runs together with the U.S. Navy, received approval to proceed with building the first PSC on December 19, according to a press release put out yesterday. Bollinger Mississippi Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi is the current prime contractor for the new icebreakers. VT Halter Marine was originally hired to design and build three of the ships in 2019. Bollinger acquired VT Halter Marine in 2022. An older rendering of what was then VT Halter’s Polar Security Cutter design. Technology Associated, Inc. via VT Halter Marine 'This decision continues work that has been underway since the summer of 2023 as part of an innovative approach to shorten the delivery timeline of these critical national assets,' yesterday's Coast Guard release says. 'The approval incorporates eight prototype fabrication assessment units (PFAUs) that are currently underway or planned.' 'The PFAU effort was structured as a progressive crawl-walk-run approach to help the shipbuilder strengthen skills across the workforce and refine construction methods before full-rate production begins,' the release adds. 'The PFAU process has prepared the government and the shipbuilder to begin full-scale production of the PSC class, resulting in more precise, cost-effective, and reliable construction processes. ' 'The progressive crawl-walk-run approach consists of verifying the processes utilized during the build to ensure design completeness. This includes unit readiness reviews, ensuring engineering, computer-aided design systems accurately transfer numerical control data to automated production machinery and slowing down early prototype module build times to maximize learning and enable improvements in the downstream production, engineering, and planning processes,' the Coast Guard had also said last year when the PFAU work began. 'Each module requires approximately four months of labor, during which time the shipyard will continue recruiting and training additional members of the workforce to manage the transition to production of the lead hull as the prototype modules are completed.' As already noted, the Coast Guard currently has one heavy icebreaker in service, the USCGC Polar Star, which displaces some 13,840 tons with a full load. The PSCs are expected to be substantially larger, displacing around 17,690 tons. Heavy icebreakers, in general, are 'defined as ships that have icebreaking capability of 6 feet of ice continuously at 3 knots, and can back and ram through at least 20 feet of ice,' according to a report from the National Research Council of the National Academies. Metal blocks the US Coast Guard displayed at a PSC-related event in 2023 offering a visual depiction of the differences in hull thickness of a heavy icebreaker, at left, and a typical Coast Guard cutter, at right. A quarter and dime are seen at left and right, respectively, to help provide additional context for the comparitive thicknesses. USCG The PSCs will also be much more modern and otherwise capable vessels than the Polar Star. The latter ship was commissioned in 1976 and has become increasingly problematic to operate despite a multi-phase service life extension program (SLEP). Given its age, just sourcing parts for Polar Star can be troublesome and its sister ship USCGC Polar Sea was sidelined decades ago and cannibalized for spares. The trio of PSCs will be a welcome boost to the Coast Guard's overall icebreaking fleets, as well. Beyond Polar Star, the service has a lone medium icebreaker, the USCGC Healy, which was commissioned in 1999. The USCGC Polar Star, at left, and the USCGC Healy, at right, moored in Seattle on August 25, 2024. USCG Having just two ocean-going icebreakers presents obvious operational limits and increases the risks of capacity gaps as was underscored just earlier this year. Healy suffered a fire that cut its planned deployment short in July. At that time, Polar Star was undergoing phase four of its SLEP. This meant the Coast Guard had no medium or heavy icebreaking capacity at all until Polar Star returned to its home port in August. Healy has also since returned to service and wrapped up a 73-day Arctic deployment on December 12. The question now is when the new PSCs will actually enter service. The mention of the 'innovative approach to shorten the delivery timeline' in the Coast Guard's press release yesterday reflects the substantial delays the program has suffered to date. As mentioned, the lead ship was originally supposed to have been delivered this year. The second and third PSCs would then follow in 2026 and 2027. The schedule slips have been blamed in the past primarily on problems in finalizing the core design. As it stands now, the initial example may not arrive until 2029, a decade after the initial contract award. Concerns are growing about potential cost overruns, as well. There are additional plans to eventually acquire new Arctic Security Cutter (ASC) medium icebreakers, but that effort has yet to begin in earnest. The Coast Guard has acquired an additional existing ocean-going icebreaker, the Aiviq, off the commercial market. However, it's unclear when that ship will enter operational service as it still requires unspecified 'minimal modifications' to meet the requirements for its new U.S. government role. The vessel will be homeported in Juneau, Alaska, and renamed Storis, in honor of a previous Coast Guard light icebreaker of the same name with an impressive service career spanning from 1942 until 2007. At the time of its decommissioning, the previous USCGC Storis was the oldest operational ship in Coast Guard inventory. The previous USCGC Storis (WMEC-38) seen ahead of its decommissioning in 2007. USCG Though a welcome addition, the new Storis will offer an at best limited capacity boost. The Coast Guard itself declared that it 'requires a fleet of eight to nine polar icebreakers to meet operational needs in polar regions' in a separate press release yesterday about it taking formal ownership of what is still currently named the Aiviq.

Coast Guard, of course, has made no public announcement pic.twitter.com/mAuOKsbK1t&mdash; Chris Cavas (@CavasShips) December 7, 2024 Earlier this year, the U.S. government announced a new Icebreaker Collaboration Effort, or ICE Pact, intended to further boost icebreaker capacity in cooperation with NATO allies Canada and Finland. Part of the ICE Pact includes taking steps to increase the icebreaker production capacity to support the needs of friendly nations. 'If we’re trying to build a long-term order book to create the demand signal we need to have the investment that’s required to generate scale,' a senior U.S. official told reporters around the rollout of the ICE Pact back in July. 'What we’re trying to do is to leverage the global order book. And our sense is if we look at allied nations that are trying to purchase icebreakers over the next decade, it’s 70 to 90 vessels.' All of this comes as the strategic significance of the Artic only continues to grow. Receding ice as a result of global climate change has opened up new access to natural resources, from oil and natural gas to fishing, as well as trade routes. New opportunities for potentially violent global competition have emerged as a result. For years now already, the Russian military has been expanding its ability to project air and naval power into the high north and the Chinese government has made clear it has ambitions in the region, as well. Russia also has the largest icebreaker fleet in the world by far, including nuclear-powered and combat-capable types. Finally moving ahead with the construction of the first PSC is an important development for the Coast Guard, but one that also unfortunately highlights the serious continued lag in acquiring these critical ships.

What We Know About The Russian Cargo Ship That Sank In Mediterran...	A Russian cargo ship claimed to be heading to Syria to take part in the Kremlin’s military withdrawal from that country, has sunk in the Mediterranean. The Ursa Major went down overnight between Spain and Algeria. The incident comes amid uncertainty over the fate of the Russian naval base at Tartus on the Syrian coast, which provides Moscow with a vital foothold in the Mediterranean. &#034;Ursa Major&#034;Video - 23.12.2024&mdash; Evgen Istrebin (@evgen-istrebin.bsky.social) 2024-12-24T07:40:04.273Z A Russian ship, Ursa Major, sank off the coast of Spain after an explosion. The cargo reportedly included nuclear icebreaker reactor hatches and two port cranes with a 120-ton capacity, en route to Vladivostok. 14 crew members were rescued, 2 are missing.&mdash; NOELREPORTS (@noelreports.com) 2024-12-24T08:51:12.529Z The Russian Foreign Ministry confirmed the cargo ship sank after an explosion in the engine room, the cause of which remains unclear. A video filmed from a tanker in the vicinity — the Ross Sea — showed the Russian ship listing badly to its starboard side, with its bow low in the water, between 12:00 and 1:00 p.m. GMT on Monday. It then sank at around 1:20 a.m. GMT on Tuesday. One of the ships involved in Russia’s evacuation from Syria, the cargo vessel Ursa Major, reportedly suffered a major engine room explosion in the Mediterranean and sank earlier today. Spanish press reports that 14 crew have been rescued, 2 are missing.&mdash; OSINTtechnical (@osinttechnical.bsky.social) 2024-12-24T00:30:56.858Z Spain’s Salvamento Marítimo maritime rescue agency said it received a distress signal from the Ursa Major on Monday when it was located around 57 miles off the coast of Almería. Two vessels and a helicopter were sent in response. A Spanish patrol boat picked up the 14 crew members from a lifeboat and brought them to the Spanish city of Cartagena. A Russian military vessel also provided assistance, later taking charge of rescue operations. The Russian Foreign Ministry says another two crew members are still unaccounted for. A Spanish Navy vessel (225988522) just popped up on AIS alongside Ursa Major.&mdash; Oliver Alexander (@oalexanderdk.bsky.social) 2024-12-23T20:10:48.897Z The Salvamento Marítimo alerted ships in the area to the 'possibility of shipwreck debris' and urged them 'to keep a sharp lookout, keep a wide berth' and report any sightings to authorities. Based on publicly available ship-tracking data, the Ursa Major had originally departed the port of St. Petersburg on December 11, with Russia claiming that its final destination was Vladivostok, in the Russian Far East. Russian accounts say that the vessel — 467 feet long, with a displacement of 12,679 tonnes — was carrying a pair of 380-tonne cranes to be used in the construction of a new nuclear-powered icebreaker, as well as other components to be used in the build. However, the Ukrainian military intelligence service, or GUR, claimed that the vessel was in fact headed to Syria, to take Russian 'weapons and equipment' out of that country, following the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime. The GUR made its claim on its Telegram channel yesterday after the cargo ship passed through the Strait of Gibraltar. Vehicles and other equipment seen clustered at the end of a pier at Russia’s Tartus naval base in Syria on December 17, 2024. Satellite image ©2024 Maxar Technologies The ship’s owner, Oboronlogistika, is a known Russian military contractor, described as 'part of the Russian defense ministry’s military construction operations.' Built in 2009, the vessel — together with its owner — was placed under sanctions by the United States in March 2022, after the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Since then, the Ursa Major has made frequent trips to Syria, transporting military equipment. Ursa Major had been in the same area of the Mediterranean as another sanctioned Russian ship, Sparta, both vessels having been noted heading through the English Channel last week, under Russian Navy escort. Over the weekend, the Portuguese Ministry of Defense confirmed that the Portuguese Air Force had been shadowing four Russian ships off its coast. As well as the Sparta, these were the drilling operations vessel Bavenit, and two Russian Navy landing ships: the Aleksandr Otrakovskiy and the Ivan Gren. The Russian Navy landing ship Ivan Gren — the lead ship of its class — off the coast of Portugal at the weekend. Portuguese Ministry of Defense The Russian Navy landing ship Aleksandr Otrakovskiy, part of the Ropucha class. Portuguese Ministry of Defense Earlier this month, the Ukrainian GUR also reported that Sparta was heading to Russia’s naval base at Tartus on the Syrian coast to move military equipment out of Syria. However, Russian authorities said that the Sparta was sailing to Port Said in Egypt. In an incident yesterday, one of the two ships apparently broke down off the coast of Portugal. The GUR reported the ship involved as the Sparta, although it’s possible it was actually the Ursa Major — which was previously named Sparta III. The Ukrainian military intelligence service said that 'the main engine’s fuel pipe failed' but this problem was relatively quickly addressed and the ship began to move again. The cargo ship Sparta off the coast of Portugal at the weekend. Portuguese Ministry of Defense While it’s not been independently verified that the Ursa Major and Sparta were headed to Tartus, the incidents reinforce the Russian military’s reliance on contractors like Oboronlogistika to move critical equipment out of Syria. This has become even more critical since Ukraine has taken a heavy toll on the Russian Navy’s Black Sea Fleet landing ships, which have been prized targets since the start of the current conflict. What’s still unclear is whether the Russian Armed Forces will depart Syria altogether, or if they will continue to have some kind of access to Tartus and the air base at Khmeimim in Latakia province. Yesterday, a Kremlin official confirmed that Russia was in contact with the new Syrian rulers and was discussing the future of its two military facilities there.

Photo by Izzettin Kasim/Anadolu via Getty Images The importance of Tartus — the only Mediterranean port available to Russia — cannot be understated. With that in mind, it’s not surprising that Moscow is now negotiating with the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) Islamist group that led the offensive against the Assad regime, to ensure continued access. In the meantime, Russian military forces have completed their withdrawal from the Syrian interior, leaving a dwindling presence only at Tartus and Khmeimim. Russian soldiers stand by military pickups as they prepare to evacuate a position in Qamishli in northeastern Syria on December 12, 2024. Photo by Delil SOULEIMAN / AFP DELIL SOULEIMAN Some of the equipment formerly in Syria has been moved to Libya, suggesting that Russia might now be seeking to establish a longer-term military presence there, as an alternative. Some analysts have even suggested that the Ursa Major might have been headed to a Libyan port, with the plan to offload the two 380-tonne cranes there, either to support Libyan National Army commander Khalifa Haftar or to help establish a permanent Russian base. There have been reports that the HTS has demanded that Russia remove the last parts of its military contingent from Tartus and Khmeimim by February 20, 2025, although these are unconfirmed. This step would be in line with the new Syrian government’s aim to have the international sanctions placed on it lifted. Ultimately, the decision on the Russian military presence in Syria will be down to the country’s new rulers. Whatever happens, Russia will be heavily reliant on shipping, either to complete its evacuation from Syria or to re-establish its military presence there under new Syrian leadership.

F/A-18F Was Downed By Friendly Fire As Jets Were About To Land On...	A friendly fire incident in the Red Sea this past weekend that saw a U.S. Navy Ticonderoga class cruiser down an F/A-18F Super Hornet came as jets were returning to the supercarrier USS Harry S. Truman, TWZ has learned. The Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group had also been fending off a sustained Houthi drone and missile attack leading up to the friendly fire incident. You can read more about what is known about this incident in our earlier reporting here. 'After successfully returning from its initial mission, an F/A-18F launched again to provide air defense support from OWAs and ASCMs that were inbound to the force,' a U.S. official told us. 'They were shot down while recovery of remaining aircraft was underway.' The F/A-18F was officially downed early on December 22 local time by a missile from the Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Gettysburg. Aircraft from the Harry S. Truman's air wing had also struck Houthi targets in Yemen on the night of December 21-22. CENTCOM Conducts Airstrikes Against Iran-Backed Houthi Missile Storage and Command/Control Facilities in YemenTAMPA, Fla. - U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) forces conducted precision airstrikes against a missile storage facility and a command-and-control facility operated by… pic.twitter.com/YRWWQJIweP&mdash; U.S. Central Command (@CENTCOM) December 21, 2024 'In the hours leading up to the incident, though, the [Truman] CSG [Carrier Strike Group] had successfully shot down two anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCM) and two one-way attack uncrewed aerial vehicles (OWA UAV) with reports of other OWA UAVs in the air,' the official added. 'The wreckage has not been located and is likely at the bottom of the Red Sea. Both crew members were successfully recovered and are back on the USS Harry S. Truman. Initial reports are that one of the crew members has minor injuries. Both have been evaluated and released from medical.' Earlier today, Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) separately told us that the two-seat Super Hornet had been 'performing a refueling mission' at the time of the friendly fire incident. We had already reached out for more clarification on what exactly the jet's mission had been. Whether or not the jet was providing 'air defense support' or if it was in a tanker configuration primarily to support the jets providing air defense support at the time is unclear. As TWZ noted earlier, F/A-18Fs do regularly provide aerial refueling support for other aircraft in Navy carrier air wings. A stock picture of an F/A-18F with an aerial refueling tanker loadout of four 480-gallon fuel tanks and a centerline hose-and-drogue refueling pod. USN There are also rumors that another Navy jet was fired upon and almost accidentally shot down during the recovery process aboard the ship, as well, but TWZ has not been able to confirm that at this time. In comments to us tonight, the U.S. official did stress that 'an investigation is underway to determine the facts and circumstances' surrounding the friendly fire incident. Many questions remain about how and why the crew of the USS Gettysburg, the most advanced Ticonderoga class cruiser in operational service at present, which returned to the fleet last year with a slew of major upgrades to its air and missile defense suite and other systems, mistakenly shot down the F/A-18F. The fact that this appears to have occurred during recovery is even more puzzling. Regardless, the details as we understand them now underscore the complexities of the current operating environment that U.S. forces are facing in and around the Red Sea. As TWZ wrote earlier: 'The Red Sea is an extremely high-threat environment with multiple layers of threats, some of which can be very hard to detect and categorize. The Houthis are actively targeting American warships, as well as commercial vessels, with various aerial drones, cruise missiles, anti-ship ballistic missiles, and unmanned surface vessels, often simultaneously. The available time in which to make potentially serious decisions can be measured in seconds.' If nothing else, thankfully both aviators onboard the downed F/A-18F, who have now been released from medical, did not suffer any serious injuries or worse.

Railgun Ammo-Firing 155mm Air Defense Cannon Set To Be Awarded To...	The U.S. Army says it is planning to award a sole-source contract to BAE Systems to produce a prototype self-propelled 155mm howitzer for use as a novel air and missile defense system. The goal is for the Multi-Domain Artillery Cannon (MDAC) to be able to knock down drones and cruise missiles, as well as traditional aircraft and helicopters, using hyper-velocity ammunition originally developed for the U.S. Navy's canceled electromagnetic railgun program. The Army's Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office (RCCTO) announced its intention to hand BAE an MDAC deal via an Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) on December 20. This is a novel contracting mechanism designed to help U.S. government agencies accelerate advanced research and development and prototype efforts. RCCTO, in cooperation with the U.S. Air Force, has been pushing ahead with plans for MDAC since at least 2022. The MDAC effort is also leveraging similar work the Pentagon's Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO) has been doing in cooperation with the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) as part of a project called the Hypervelocity Ground Weapon System (HGWS). The current goal is to have a complete prototype MDAC battery on hand by the fourth quarter of Fiscal Year 2027 and then conduct an actual operational demonstration of the capability in Fiscal Year 2028. 'A full MDACS Battery consists of eight (8) Multi-Domain Artillery Cannons (MDAC), four (4) Multi-Function Precision Radars (MFPR), two (2) Multi-Domain Battle Managers (MDBM), and separately, no less than 144 Hypervelocity Projectiles (HVP),' according to the latest RCCTO contracting notice. 'The MDACS mission is to defend Joint Force fixed and semi-fixed locations against attack by a broad spectrum of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), Cruise Missiles (CM), Fixed Wing (FW), Rotary Wing (RW), and other advanced air and missile threats and to complement existing air and missile defenses by operating in integrated operational scenarios.' The contracting notice from RCCTO does not provide any details about BAE's proposed MDAC design or about any of the other planned elements of the prototype battery. The War Zone has reached out to BAE for more information. The Army has called for a wheeled 155mm howitzer design in the past to meet its MDAC requirements, according to a Request for Information (RFI) notice the service put out in July. The RFI also laid out demands for 'remote weapon firing capability,' 'high rates of fire with [the] HVP,' 'deep magazine capacity,' and 'rapid ammunition resupply time (manual and automated).' MDAC has also been depicted as being able to fit inside a C-130 cargo plane in the past, as seen below, which would add to its flexibility in future expeditionary and distributed operations. USAF The Army's MDAC stipulations do raise the question of whether BAE's MDAC could be based on the Archer self-propelled 155mm howitzer, which is notably not C-130 transportable in its current form. Developed by Bofors in Sweden, which is now a BAE subsidiary, Archer does however feature an auto-loader that feeds from 21-round a magazine. Per the manufacturer, the crew can emplace the howitzer from within the safety of its armored cab within 14 seconds, fire an initial round within 23 seconds, and pack back up to move after firing three more rounds within 74 seconds. These capabilities would align well with an air defense role requiring relatively rapid shots against multiple targets. The Army is also set to evaluate Archer as a possible new self-propelled 155mm howitzer for use as a traditional artillery piece as part of its Self-Propelled Howitzer Modernization (SPH-M) effort. BAE Systems could also be developing a completely new design to meet the MDAC requirements. As seen earlier in this story, the Army and the Air Force have shown a notional MDAC system in the past with a chassis that looks to be based on a 6&#215;6 member of the Family of Medium Tactical Vehicle (FMTV) series of trucks. Currently manufactured by Oshkosh Defense, the FTMV is one of the truck families in widespread Army service today. It is unclear whether or not the Multi-Function Precision Radar (MFPR) and the Multi-Domain Battle Manager (MDBM) portions of the MDAC battery will be entirely new systems, or include existing capabilities and/or ones the Army is already in the process of acquiring. 'The MDAC will interface with an external… Command and Control Battle Manager (C2BM) and the Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Battle Command System (IBCS),' according to the July RFI. ICBS is a new overarching air and missile defense-focused network architecture the Army is in the process of fielding now, which you can read more about here. When it comes to the HVP ammunition, as already noted, this was developed as part of the U.S. Navy's abortive electromagnetic railgun program. BAE developed the HVP, which looks to have given the company a leg up when it comes to the MDAC program. 'RCCTO believes BAE Systems Land & Armaments L.P. is the only responsible source capable of developing and delivering both the MDAC and HVP prototypes within the required schedule; competition of this effort is not practicable and will not meet mission fielding requirements,' the recent sole-source contracting announcement declares. A US Navy officer holds an example of the BAE Systems HVP design. USN The original HVP round was a hit-to-kill kinetic projectile designed to destroy targets simply by smashing into them after reaching a reported peak speed of 5,600 miles per hour. However, plans were already presented years ago now for versions with high-explosive warheads that 155mm howitzers and 5-inch naval guns could fire out to maximum ranges of 17 or 40 nautical miles, respectively. A now-dated US Navy briefing slide with details about the different versions of the BAE Systems HVP. USN Models of different versions of the BAE HVP design. Also note the different discarding sabots structures. Joseph Trevithick The HVP was also always envisioned as being able to engage aerial threats, as well as targets on land and at sea. In 2020, an Air Force-led test demonstrated the ability of a 155mm howitzer to knock down a BQM-167 target drone serving as a surrogate for a subsonic cruise missile with an HVP. U.S. military budget documents show plans at least for other more recent MDAC/HGWS test events, but what, if any results they produced are unclear. Another old US Navy briefing slide showing how railgun armed ships (as well as other platforms firing HVPs) could potentially engage a wide variety of aerial threats, including cruise missiles, as well as surface targets. USN A briefing slide related to the Navy's past railgun and HVP programs. It shows how ships could potentially engage a wide variety of aerial threats, including cruise missiles, as well as surface targets, with HVPs fired by conventional 5-inch naval guns. HGWS/MDAC could have similarly multi-purpose capabilities. USN Work on MDAC now comes amid an ever-expanding and evolving aerial threat ecosystem facing U.S. military forces deployed downrange, as well as in their home garrisons. A growing array of ever more capable armed drones and cruise missiles in service with near-peer competitors, especially China, as well as smaller countries and even non-state actors present particular concerns for America's armed forces. Larger and longer-ranged kamikaze drones are also steadily blurring the lines between uncrewed systems and traditional cruise missiles. Though drone and cruise missile threats are not new, as The War Zone regularly notes, the ongoing war in Ukraine, as well as crises in and around the Middle East in the past year or so, have re-emphasized the need for the development of new defensive capabilities. It is in this context that the Army is looking at MDAC as one way to provide a new, readily deployable air and missile defense capability that is also lower cost to employ than traditional surface-to-air missile systems. In the past, the per-round cost of BAE's HVP has been estimated to be $100,000 or less. Even current short-range man-portable Stinger surface-to-air missiles cost around $400,000 apiece, while upper-tier long-range interceptors like the PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) for the Patriot system have unit prices in the millions of dollars. It is important to stress that if MDAC does enter operational service in the future it would be deployed as part of layered defensive architecture and would not be able to provide all-around air and missile defense by itself in complex threat scenarios. The Army's work on MDAC also comes amid questions about the future of burden sharing between it and the Air Force when it comes to air base defense, both downrange and domestically. Since the Air Force was split off from the Army in the late 1940s, the latter service has retained the lead responsibility to protect airfields against aerial attack. Just this year, Air Force officials publicly questioned whether this division of roles and missions makes sense going forward. 'We know that, doctrinally, the Army has taken responsibility since the 1940s for air base air defense. We may have some questions on that,' Dr. Ravi Chaudhary, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Energy, Installations, and Environment, said during a virtual talk the Air & Space Forces Association hosted earlier this month regarding the rollout of a new base modernization strategy. 'We may want to enter in a broader discussion on what that’s going to look like going forward, because right now, the threats are so localized and so tactical that we may want to have a broader discussion … and take on some of those mission sets going forward.' 'Frankly, I would be comfortable with the Department of the Air Force taking on the total defense/local defense of air bases as an organic mission, if the needed resources – human and financial, etc – were made available,' Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall had also said during a keynote speech at the Airlift/Tanker Association’s (ATA) annual symposium in November. In the meantime, the Army is pressing ahead on MDAC, now with the planned sole-source deal with BAE Systems, and the goal of demonstrating this relatively exotic air and missile defense capability before the end of the decade.

Ex-Mossad Agents Reveal Details Of How They Turned Hezbollah’s Co...	Key details of the Israeli intelligence service’s operation targeting members of Hezbollah with exploding pagers and walkie-talkies in September have been revealed. You can read our reporting of the first wave of explosions here, and the second wave here. Israel didn’t initially admit responsibility for the blasts but was always acknowledged to have been behind them — although exactly how it orchestrated them had remained mysterious. The new information about the campaign was provided by two recently retired senior Mossad agents, who spoke with the 60 Minutes news magazine broadcast on the CBS television network. Both wore masks while interviewed and gave false names. First, it’s worth recapping how the operations played out. The first wave of explosions, on September 17, targeted pagers used by Hezbollah. At around 3:30 p.m. local time, it seems the pagers were triggered simultaneously, by a specific message. The message was one that looked, at least, as if it was sent by Hezbollah leadership. The detonation then happened with a slight delay. The second wave of explosions, on the following day, targeted walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah. A communication device on the ground as the Lebanese Army prepares to destroy it in a controlled explosion, in southern Lebanon between the villages of Burj al Muluk and Klayaa, on September 19, 2024. Photo by Rabih DAHER / AFP RABIH DAHER In total, thousands of devices used by the militant group were targeted. As might be expected for an operation so complex, it took years to shape, with the two Mossad agents — named as 'Michael' and 'Gabriel' — apparently being key players in its planning. According to CBS, work to weaponize the walkie-talkies began more than a decade before the attacks. It was already expected that the batteries of the devices were used to carry the explosives, confirmed by Michael, who noted that the walkie-talkies, in particular, were chosen since they would fit into the chest pockets of tactical vests used by the militants. As for the batteries, these were made in Israel at a Mossad facility, Michael said, and then put in more than 16,000 walkie-talkies, not all of which were used on September 16. A photo taken on September 18, 2024, in Beirut’s southern suburbs, shows the remains of exploded pagers on display at an undisclosed location. Photo by AFP To get these devices into Hezbollah’s hands, they were sold via shell companies, which then infiltrated the group. The chosen price was low enough to ensure that Hezbollah thought it was getting a good deal, but not too low to arouse suspicion. Since the walkie-talkies were expected to be carried in armored tactical vests, it was considered less likely that the targeted members of the group would be wearing them when they were detonated. After all, these vests would normally only be donned when the militant in question was actually taking part in an operation, or training for one. To make the operation more effective, weaponized pagers were added to the attack plans, with work on these starting much later, in 2022. In the case of the pagers — which were seen as much more reliable weapons, since they were carried by the targeted individuals at most times — Mossad discovered that Hezbollah was planning to buy such devices from a Taiwan-based company, Gold Apollo. The problem with the original Gold Apollo pagers was the size, since they appeared to be too slim to accommodate the explosives required. This led to Mossad running extensive tests, including detonating larger pagers on dummies, to calibrate the destructive effect. According to Gabriel, the amount of explosive was calculated to injure the targeted fighter, but not anyone next to them. While there are videos that show detonations injuring the targeted individual while leaving passersby unscathed, it’s also the case that other individuals — including at least two children — were killed.

Thought was given to the pager ring tones, to ensure they would sound urgent enough to draw a response. Meanwhile, the timer on the explosive charge was also calculated for maximum effect — the average time to call up the message on a pager after hearing the alert is seven seconds, according to Mossad. According to Gabriel, Dadi Barnea, the director of Mossad, was initially skeptical that the larger and heavier pager would be attractive to Hezbollah, who would likely favor a lighter and more portable device. But he was convinced otherwise and, meanwhile, Gabriel worked on an advertising campaign. 'We create a pretend world,' Michael explained. 'We are a global production company. We write the screenplay, we’re the directors, we’re the producers, we’re the main actors, and the world is our stage.' The advertising stressed the fact that the pagers were 'robust, dustproof and waterproof, with a long battery life.' These claims were presented in fake YouTube ads, backed up with fake online testimonials. This, of course, led to interest from individuals outside Hezbollah, who Mossad didn’t sell the devices to. Part of the strategy to keep them away from other customers involved quoting them exorbitant prices. People and first responders gather at the scene of a reported device explosion in Saida in southern Lebanon on September 18, 2024. Photo by Mahmoud ZAYYAT / AFP To get the pagers into Hezbollah’s hands, Mossad first had to supply them to Gold Apollo, which they also did via shell companies, including one in Hungary. A licensing partnership with Gold Apollo allowed Mossad to manufacture the pagers, while the Taiwanese firm still retained credibility. 'When they are buying from us, they have zero clue that they are buying from the Mossad. We make like the ‘Truman Show,’ everything is controlled by us behind the scene,' Gabriel told CBS. 'In their experience, everything is normal. Everything was 100 percent kosher.' To ensure that Hezbollah got the pagers, Mossad hired the relevant Gold Apollo saleswoman, who was unaware she was working with Israeli intelligence. The saleswoman offered the first batch of pagers to Hezbollah for free, while follow-on sales provided the militants with around 5,000 pagers by September 2024. The timing of the pager detonations was driven, to a significant degree, by concerns that the plot might be about to be uncovered. There was less suspicion around the walkie-talkies, which were detonated the following day, some of them exploding while being carried at funerals of those killed by the pagers.

Photo by Anwar AMRO / AFP Very quickly, Lebanon was gripped by panic, with residents, Hezbollah or otherwise, worried about what electronic devices would explode next. In the event, around 30 people were killed, including two children, in the two attacks. In addition, 3,000 people were injured, which was also part of Mossad’s plan.

Photo by JOSEPH EID / AFP 'If he’s just dead, so he’s dead,' Gabriel said. 'But if he [is] wounded, you have to take him to the hospital, take care of him. You need to invest money and effort. And those people without hands and eyes are living proof, walking in Lebanon, of ‘don't mess with us.’' According to the former Mossad agents, the operation was a major success, undermining Hezbollah’s fighting capacity, decimating its leadership and command and control, and paving the way for the Israeli Air Force attacks that struck targets across Lebanon in the days after. A building destroyed in the Israeli airstrike in Beirut’s southern suburbs on September 27, 2024, which killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Photo by Ibrahim AMRO / AFP Before the end of September, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah had been killed by an airstrike in Beirut and a ceasefire with the group came into effect at the end of November. You can read all about that operation here. The retired Mossad agents speaking to CBS were clearly buoyed by the success of the operation targeting walkie-talkies and pagers, and by the diminished fighting capacity of Hezbollah. At the same time, the Israel Defense Forces were also steadily eroding Hamas, with a relentless campaign of bombardment in Gaza. More recently, the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria has prompted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to speak of a changing order in the region, with the heart ripped out of three of Iran’s key proxies there. Armed with Rampage missiles, an F-16 is prepared for a mission to strike Houthi targets in Yemen. IDF IDF 'After Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Assad regime in Syria, the Houthis are almost the last remaining arm of Iran’s axis of evil,' Netanyahu said last week. 'The Houthis are learning, and will learn the hard way, that those who strike Israel will pay a very heavy price for it.' As to the question of what Mossad does next, we can only guess. But what is clear is that the exploding walkie-talkies and pagers are very unlikely to be attempted again. 'We can’t use the pagers again because we already did that,' Michael told CBS. 'We’ve already moved on to the next thing. And they’ll have to keep on trying to guess what the next thing is.'

North Korea To Send More Troops To Fight For Russia Against Ukrai...	As the war in Ukraine drags on toward a fourth year, North Korea is preparing to send Moscow more troops beyond the 12,000 already there, as well as additional weapons, including suicide drones, according to the latest assessment from South Korean intelligence. This comes amid claims that casualties are mounting for Pyongyang's forces in Kursk. 'A comprehensive assessment of multiple intelligence shows that North Korea is preparing to rotate or increase the deployment of troops (in Russia),' the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said, without offering specific numbers, according to the Yonhap News Agency. Ukrainian officials are also seeing signs that North Korea might send more troops to Russia. 'Today, we also received a report from Commander-in-Chief Syrskyi on the frontline and the areas of the Kursk operation,' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Twitter. 'There are risks of North Korea sending additional troops and military equipment to the Russian army, and we will have tangible responses to this.'

'There are also some signs of (the North) moving to manufacture and supply suicide drones, first unveiled during Kim Jong-un's on-site inspection in November,' the JCS said, according to Yonhap. The South Korean Joint Chiefs attributed the move to 'the North's efforts to gain practical warfare experience and modernize its conventional weapons system.' 'North Korea appears to be preparing to deploy additional troops and military equipment to Russia, possibly including suicide drones, in support of Moscow's war against Ukraine, the South's military said Monday.'A comprehensive assessment of multiple intelligence shows that… pic.twitter.com/bj7aVkjTvR&mdash; Rob Lee (@RALee85) December 23, 2024 A recent Wall Street Journal analysis of satellite imagery bolsters the South Korean JCS claim that North Korea is increasing weapons deliveries to Russia. The imagery shows 'that North Korea is shipping more munitions to Russia and is expanding arms production at home to churn out the weapons Moscow needs to feed its voracious war machine,' the publication reported. 'Assistance from North Korea is allowing Russia to press its advantage against exhausted Ukrainian troops and could help it resist pressure from the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump to end the conflict.' North Korea is providing 60% of the artillery and mortar shells used by Russia in Ukraine, Andriy Kovalenko, a Ukrainian army officer heading a government unit tasked with countering Russian disinformation, told WSJ. 'North Korean ammunition is holding the Russian defenses,' he said. 'North Korea’s missiles now make up nearly a third of Russia’s ballistic missile launches at Ukraine this year, according to Ukrainian officials.' The North Korean KN-23 short-range ballistic missile seen here may be among the types that Russia has received. North Korean State Media 'Russia is increasingly dependent on the DPRK,' Kovalenko said on Telegram Monday. 'They cannot extend the front without their ammunition, they are not able to fight in Kursk without their people, they will become increasingly dependent on their equipment.' Kovelenko called for Ukraine to continue to strike Russian economic assets to reduce its ability to pay for North Korean assistance. 'This is a great shame for Russia,' he posited. 'However, in the future, it is worth understanding that the Russian military-industrial complex will weaken, but the DPRK military-industrial complex will work, and so that it does not provide the Russian Federation's ability to fight, it is necessary to destroy the Russian Federation's economic ability to pay.' As we’ve previously reported, in addition to millions of rounds of artillery ammunition, North Korea has also provided Russia with KN-23 short-range ballistic missiles also known as Hwasong-11s. The ROK JSC assessment noted that Pyongyang is also supplying Russia with 240-millimeter rocket launchers and 170 mm self-propelled artillery. As we reported last week, shipments of North Korean 170mm M1989 Koksan self-propelled artillery units were seen on rail cars heading to the front lines. The main advantage of the weapon is its long range, with the big 170mm gun assessed as capable of firing a standard shell to a range of around 25 miles, or a rocket-assisted shell to a range of 37 miles. For a long time, the weapon was judged to be the longest-range conventional artillery piece in North Korean service. The Koksans first began to appear in Russia in November. You can see video of the recent rail shipment of these weapons below.

The arrangement is not an immediate quid pro quo, the publication added, but made by Kim in the hope of future benefits. 'U.S. officials do not believe Mr. Kim has received anything immediate in return,' the Times stated. 'Instead, they say, he appears to be hoping that Russia will repay the favor in the future by offering support in diplomatic fights, assisting if a crisis breaks out and providing technology.'

North Korea has received shipments of food from Russia in the past, South Korean lawmakers have said. It has also received 'more than a million barrels of oil since March this year, according to satellite imagery analysis from the Open Source Centre, a non-profit research group based in the UK,' according to the BBC. In exchange for sending troops to Russia, it was believed that North Korea would potentially receive air defense systems and additional energy supplies and was reportedly going to receive fighter aircraft as well. There have also been concerns that Moscow might provide North Korea with technologies to help accelerate its nuclear and long-range ballistic missile programs. Russia would also be a prime candidate to assist North Korea in pushing forward its submarine program, which also includes a growing family of submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) as well as increasingly advanced submarine technologies.

(Photo by Vladimir Smirnov / POOL / AFP) VLADIMIR SMIRNOV Regardless of the details of the deal, North Korean troops and weapons are helping Russia squeeze the salient Ukraine established when it invaded the Kursk region in August. They are being used 'as small, light infantry … and a little bit of indirect fire usage with mortar platoons, and things of that nature that they’ve been employing,' a senior U.S. military official told reporters, including from The War Zone, last week. 'As far as the capabilities, they’re consistent with what you would think they would have, their lower caliber indirect fire capability, and then direct fire capability, and obviously the kind of communications equipment that you would expect.' The North Koreans are reportedly paying an increasingly heavy price for aiding Russia. Their complete lack of previous combat experience is contributing to increasing casualties, the senior military official pointed out. 'They’re definitely up on the front line. They’re taking casualties. Based on the latest understanding that we have as of this afternoon, we’re looking at several hundred casualties … everything from wounds, up to being [killed in action] KIA.' On Monday, South Korea's spy agency suggested the figure was even higher now, with about 1,100 DPRK casualties, Yonhap reported. Zelensky on Monday claimed there were three times as many North Koreans killed or wounded. 'Now, according to preliminary data, the number of North Korean soldiers killed and wounded in the Kursk region has already exceeded 3,000,' Zelensky said.

The senior U.S. military official told us that the Pentagon concurs with previous reports that Ukraine has lost about 40% of the territory captured in Kursk during two major counter-operations. The news about Pyongyang's additional support for Moscow only adds to the pressure faced by Kyiv as the clock ticks down to a new Trump administration that could be far less supportive than Biden's. The Latest On the battlefield, Russia continues to gain ground in Kursk, but despite a large-scale push across eastern Ukraine, made only incremental gains toward Pokrovsk and Toretsk. According to the latest assessment from the Institute for the Study of War: Kursk: Russian forces recently advanced in the Ukrainian salient in Kursk Oblast amid continued fighting in the area on December 22. Russian forces continued assault operations southeast of Korenevo near Novoivanovka and Kruglenkoye, north of Sudzha near Malaya Loknya, Cherkasskoye Porechnoye, and Pogrebki; and northeast of Sudzha near Martynovka. Kharkiv: Russian forces continued ground attacks in the Kharkiv direction on December 22 but did not make any confirmed advances. Luhansk: Russian forces recently marginally advanced in the Kupyansk direction amid continued offensive operations along the Kupyansk-Svatove-Kreminna line on December 22. Donetsk: Russian forces conducted offensive operations northeast of Siversk near Serebryanka and Bilohorivka, east of Siversk near Verkhnokamyanske, southeast of Siversk near Vyimka, toward Chasiv Yar, Kurakhove, Vuhledar and near Velyka Novosilka on December 22 but did not make any confirmed advances. However, they recently advanced toward Toretsk and Pokrovsk. Zaporizhzhia: Ukrainian forces recently regained lost positions in western Zaporizhia Oblast following reports of localized Ukrainian offensive operations in the area. Geolocated footage published on December 22 indicates that Ukrainian forces recently regained lost positions in central Kamyanske (northwest of Robotyne and south of Zaporizhzhia City). Kherson: A Ukrainian official confirmed that Russian sabotage and reconnaissance groups recently attempted a limited crossing of the Dnipro River in Kherson Oblast. Ukrainian Southern Defense Forces Spokesperson Colonel Vladyslav Voloshyn stated on December 21 that Russian forces conducted heavy artillery and rocket strikes against the west (right) bank of Kherson Oblast on December 20, during which a Russian sabotage and reconnaissance group unsuccessfully attempted to cross the Dnipro River near the Antonivsky roadway bridge (east of Kherson City) - consistent with recent Russian milblogger claims on December 21.

'Two sources in air defense units told the Guardian the deficit at the front has become so acute that the general staff has ordered already-depleted air defense units to free up more men to send to the front as infantry,' the publication reported. 'It’s reaching a critical level where we can’t be sure that air defense can function properly,' one of the sources told the Guardian, adding he had been prompted to speak out by a fear that the situation was a risk to Ukraine’s security. 'These people knew how air defense works, some had been trained in the West and had real skills, now they are sent to the front to fight, for which they have no training,' said the source. Another concern is that if any of these troops are captured, they could provide critical information about the location and capabilities of Ukrainian air defense systems. Ukrainian Air Force spokesman Col. Yuri Ignat pushed back on the assertion that his country's air defenses would suffer as a result of this mobilization. 'Of course, transferring to the Infantry creates problematic issues with personnel inside the Air Force,' he said Sunday on Facebook. 'There are not enough people and that's also a well-known fact! But why talk about the ineffectiveness of the [air defenses] and that the [interceptions of Russian aerial threats] have become less? After all, the [air defenses] are not just the Air Force! It is an air defense system of the country that includes units of all Defense Forces capable of conducting air fire, and infantry, sailors, and helicopters&#8230;' This all comes as Zelensky has refused to heed public calls from the Biden administration to lower the age at which men can be mobilized from 25, where it currently stands, to 18, citing the sensitivities of sending younger men to fight in a society that already faces a demographic crisis.

Speaking on national TV, Sergeant Volodymyr Dehtiarov, spokesperson for the Khartiia Brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine, said 'dozens of units of robotic and unmanned equipment' supported by surveillance drones were used in the assault, the Kyiv Independent reported. The attack took place near the village of Lyptsi, north of Kharkiv. Dehtiarov said the drones included uncrewed ground vehicles (UGV) equipped with machine guns and kamikaze FPV drones. He did not say when this engagement took place. 'The Battle of Lyptsi is an important step in the transformation of the character of war from a purely human endeavor to something quite different in the 21st century,' retired Australian Army Maj. Gen. Mick Ryan, now a military analyst, postulated on Twitter.

He was the first to report the all-drone assault. 'While other nations are watching these developments closely, Ukraine is establishing itself as a full-scale testing ground for technologically advanced warfare,' he noted. 'The drones and UGVs used in this attack were reportedly mostly indigenously designed or modified from commercial equipment.

They also present real threats to vessels in port, as well as bridges and other coastal infrastructure. Now Russia is taking a page from that playbook. Its navy is creating a new training course for USV operators that includes nighttime drills to mimic Ukrainian USV attacks and defenses, according to the Russian RU1 news outlet.

Among them is a cruise missile called Trembita, named for the Ukrainian Alpine horn, The Economist reported on Monday. 'We might miss our target,' Serhiy Biryukov, who heads the missile’s ragtag crew of volunteer engineers, told the publication, 'but we’ll fly the thing so low above Russian trenches they will shit themselves.' 'Trembita’s engine is a modern $200 remake of the pulsejet first used on the German V-1 bomb in 1944,' The Economist noted. 'The engine tube is rough-and-ready. A more stylish grey rectangular casing hangs below it, hiding the missile’s guidance system and warhead. The basic Trembita flies at 400 km/h with a range of 200km. A larger and more powerful model is being developed to reach Moscow. Serial production is set to follow the final field tests. Getting this far has taken the enthusiasts just a year and a half—a feat in a field where getting from the drawing board to the battlefield usually takes many years.'

What’s In The Bill That Aims To Revitalize America’s Decaying Nav...	A sprawling, bipartisan proposal to rebuild America’s long-ailing shipbuilding industry was introduced by a group of lawmakers last week. Known as the Shipbuilding and Harbor Infrastructure for Prosperity and Security (SHIPS) for America Act, the ambitious bill seeks to overhaul and restore America’s military and civilian maritime capacity and capabilities. These industries have increasingly fallen behind over the decades, and concerns have grown urgent as China’s shipbuilding capacity continues to dwarf America’s in many respects. 'This is the first major piece of maritime reform since the Merchant Marine Act of 1970,' Sal Mercogliano, a former Military Sealift Command mariner and associate professor of history at Campbell University, told USNI News’ Mallory Shelbourne this week. 'So you’re talking about 55 years since we’ve had anything like this.' Bipartisan SHIPS Act Aims to Revitalize U.S. Maritime Industry, Counter China's DominanceKey Provisions of the SHIPS for America Act1&#x20e3;National Maritime Strategy: Establishes a Maritime Security Advisor within the White House and a Maritime Security Board to coordinate…&mdash; Sal Mercogliano (WGOW Shipping) (@mercoglianos) December 19, 2024 'By supporting shipbuilding, shipping, and workforce development, it will strengthen supply chains, reduce our reliance on foreign vessels, put Americans to work in good-paying jobs, and support the Navy and Coast Guard’s shipbuilding needs,' one of the bill's co-sponsors, Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), a Navy veteran and the first U.S Merchant Marine Academy graduate elected to Congress, said in a statement. Among its many provisions, the SHIPS Act would require the Navy to develop a strategy for a 'rearm-at-sea' capability for the surface fleet. It doesn’t specify which platforms would get the capability, but the sea service has already been testing systems for reloading vertical launching system (VLS) missile cells at sea, and did it successfully for the first time in October. In that instance, the Military Sealift Command’s dry cargo ship USNS Washington Chambers (T-AKE 11) transferred an empty VLS weapon container to the USS Chosin (CG-65), a Ticonderoga class cruiser, while underway off southern California. Such a capability would be vital during a war against China in the expanses of the Western Pacific, one that would likely involve a heavy volume of missile fire by Navy warships far from ports. Being able to reload at sea helps mitigate such a challenge. Sailors change out an empty Vertical Launching System (VLS) weapon container aboard the Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Chosin (CG-65) in October. (U.S. Navy) The act would also help private shipbuilders to better service military and commercial customers by requiring the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard to assess and integrate commercial best practices for designing, repairing, and building vessels. As the United States seeks to get its shipbuilding house in order, China's Military-Civil Fusion strategy in shipbuilding has already given the country a massive long-term edge in building commercial, naval and support vessels relatively efficiently and cheaply compared to America and its allies. Some in the U.S. have started to call for similar integration of commercial and naval shipbuilding. 'The United States has substantial latent shipbuilding, sustainment, and repair capacity, including aging but not obsolete capital assets, a strong base of potential skilled-trade labor, and a middle-management and engineering talent base that has become geographically separated from shipyards,' McKinsey and Co., a consultancy, wrote in June. 'Rapidly increasing output requires tapping into this latent capacity quickly and confidently.' The legislation would also mandate a plan for how the Defense Production Act could be used to enhance shipyard infrastructure, the defense shipyard industrial base, and port infrastructure. It would work to bolster smaller shipyards, providing $100 million annually from Fiscal Year 2025 to 2034. A loan fund would also be stood up for reflagging vessels or 'converting a vessel to a more useful military configuration.' The SHIPS Act further seeks to expand the American shipyard industrial base for military and civilian vessels by way of a 25 percent tax credit for such investments, while establishing other financial incentives to encourage innovation in shipbuilding and repair. A U.S. Center for Maritime Innovation, with hubs across the country, would work to accelerate next-generation ship design, alternative energy and manufacturing as well. All these steps seek to help the Navy and American shipbuilding industry that struggle to get new platforms out on time and on budget, while supporting those that are already in the water. The latter has been a massive challenge as the Navy's fleet ages while demands for more hulls increase. Crumbling shipyards around the U.S. and a limited number of them that can support mainline military vessels is a huge problem that has led to major delays in maintenance, greatly harming available end strength. It is also of major concern if ships were to get damaged in battle during a conflict and need to be regenerated quickly. While some improvements and investments have been made in upgrading shipyards, it is still a glaring and highly concerning issue. In the shipyards, America’s shipbuilding capacity was in decline even before the end of the Cold War, and shrunk more afterward. It is at a particularly low point, an ebb helped along by the yards’ struggle to attract a sufficient workforce. 'Currently, the United States and China have relative parity in overall economic output,' retired Marine Corps Maj. Jeffrey L. Seavy, noted in the U.S. Naval Institute's Proceedings publication in April. 'In terms of shipbuilding, however, China has 46.59 percent of the global market and is the largest builder, with South Korea second at 29.24 percent, and Japan third with 17.25 percent. The United States has a relative insignificant capacity at 0.13 percent.' To offset domestic shortfalls, Navy leaders have been exploring the possibility of repairing U.S. ships in Korean or Japanese shipyards, although by law American warships can't be built outside of the states. The nation's sealift capacity has been deteriorating as well. U.S. Transportation Command leaders told Congress in April that sealift readiness was a primary concern, and that 17 of the 47 Ready Reserve Force ships were more than 50-years-old, which was dragging readiness rates to alarming levels. To bolster the U.S. sealift fleet, the bill would allow the U.S. to enter into agreements with treaty allies to meet sealift requirements. Already, the Navy is testing the waters for using Pacific allies for such logistics needs. The U.S.-flagged international fleet would also grow to 250 ships in 10 years via a 'Strategic Commercial Fleet Program' to establish 'a fleet of commercially operated, U.S.-flagged, American crewed, and domestically built merchant vessels that can operate competitively in international commerce,' according to a summary of the bill provided by the Kelly's office. 'The United States has fewer than 200 oceangoing vessels of the United States, of which only approximately 80 vessels participate in international commerce, compared with more than 5,500 Chinese documented vessels,' the legislation states. 'In order to increase the fleet rapidly, carriers may also submit a bid to bring a foreign-built vessel into the fleet and reflag it,' the bill states. In a nod to how U.S. officials view China as a threat beyond its military, the bill also calls for an evaluation of the Chinese government-affiliated National Transportation and Logistics Public Information Platform, or LOGINK. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission warned in 2022 that LOGINK 'potentially provides the Chinese Communist Party access to data collected and stored on the platform and could enable the Chinese government to gain insights into shipping information, cargo valuations via customs clearance forms, and destination and routing information.' LOGINK, which operates in more than 20 global ports, could undercut U.S. firms economically and expose supply chain vulnerabilities, according to the commission. On the personnel side, the bill would give the Navy Secretary additional authority to recruit and retain civilian mariners working under the MSC. These mariners would play a vital role manning ships moving troops and materiel in the event of a war with China, but the command has struggled with finding enough people. MSC announced in November that it would sideline 17 support vessels to ease the strain on the civilian mariner workforce amid personnel shortages, USNI News’ Mallory Shelbourne reported. Japanese sailors aboard the guided-missile destroyer JS Shimakaze say goodbye to civilian mariners aboard the fleet replenishment oiler USNS Harvey Milk following a replenishment-at-sea in September 2024. (U.S. Military Sealift Command) To keep such civilian mariners around, the bill would also allow merchant mariners or U.S. shipyard employees to qualify for loan forgiveness if they are employed on an American vessel or shipyard for 10 years. Mariners who have received the Merchant Marine Expeditionary Medal or other mariner medals for service in a designated combat zone would also become eligible for G.I. Bill benefits under the legislation if they were not already eligible. To find new talent, the bill would enact targeted recruiting campaigns run by private marketing firms to promote maritime industry careers, and would have military recruiters recommend at-sea or shipyard careers to prospects who don’t qualify for military service. If passed, the bill would also raise the profile of maritime security affairs by creating a maritime security advisor role within the White House that would lead whole-of-government decisions about American maritime strategy. The SHIPS Act was introduced last week by co-sponsor Kelly and U.S. Rep. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.), a supporter of the plan and President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for national security advisor. Other sponsors include Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.), U.S. Rep. John Garamendi (D-Calif.), ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee’s Subcommittee on Readiness and U.S. Rep. Trent Kelly (R-Miss.), chairman of the House’s Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee whose home state hosts several major shipyards. NEW: Today I introduced legislation to revitalize America’s ailing maritime industry. It’s one of the biggest problems no one is talking about — and fixing it will create jobs, lower prices, and strengthen our national security. Let me tell you how. pic.twitter.com/KEXHq90eBg&mdash; Senator Mark Kelly (@SenMarkKelly) December 19, 2024 The legislation is paid for via a Maritime Security Trust Fund, similar to existing highway and aviation trust funds. A Kelly spokesperson told TWZ that the bill authorizes $18.1 billion over a decade. The legislation states those funds will come from duties, fees, and penalties imposed on vessels in international commerce, regular tonnage taxes proceeds, special tonnage taxes, light money, duties imposed on foreign nations and tariffs, which are all collected by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Industry appears to support the legislation, as its announcement features a bevy of American maritime interests, including shipbuilding associations, shipbuilding corporations, academia and defense groups. TWZ has regularly reported on the shortfalls of the U.S. shipbuilding industry over the years. A leaked U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence slide revealed in 2023 that China’s shipbuilders are believed to be more than 200 times more capable of producing surface combatants, support ships and submarines than their American counterparts. This is due to the country being a major shipbuilder globally and the ability to use its yards to build military and commercial vessels as needed. Such a revelation underscored longstanding worries about the U.S. Navy’s ability to challenge Chinese fleets, or sustain its forces afloat, during a war. Reporting at the time explained the significance of that slide: 'The most eye-catching component of the slide is a depiction of the relative Chinese and U.S. shipbuilding capacity expressed in terms of gross tonnage. The graphic shows that China’s shipyards have a capacity of around 23,250,000 tons versus less than 100,000 tons in the United States. That is at least an astonishing 232 times greater than the United States.' A U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence slide showcases the differing shipbuilding capabilities of the United States and China. (U.S. Navy) At more than 370 ships by the Pentagon’s latest count, in terms of hulls alone, the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) already exceeds the Navy’s battle force fleet of nearly 300. The ONI slide revealed that, by 2035, the gap between Chinese ships and U.S. vessels will widen substantially. Navy leaders have at times in recent years sought to downplay the numeric differential between the rival fleets, as TWZ reported last year. Much legislation gets introduced with great fanfare and urgency, only to fall by the wayside once the sausage-making commences. Whether the SHIPS Act suffers the same fate remains to be seen. It would seem to be inline with incoming president Trump's general view of the need to revitalize American industrial production. Stabilizing the shipbuilding and vessel support base would seem to be part of that general concept, along with the goal of building a stronger Navy. Either way, it signals that the U.S. maritime universe’s long-chronicled deficiencies are now attracting attempts at meaningful higher-level action.

F/A-18F Shot Down By Friendly Cruiser Was In The Middle Of A Refu...	A U.S. Navy F/A-18F Super Hornet was conducting a refueling mission over the Red Sea when it was downed in a friendly fire incident this past weekend. The Ticonderoga class USS Gettysburg fired on the jet for reasons that are now under investigation. That cruiser also happens to be the first of its class to have gone through a deep modernization program that includes significant upgrades to its air defense suite, making it the most advanced operational example of its dwindling class. 'The [F/A-18F] aircraft is part of Carrier Airwing (CVW) 1 and was performing a refueling mission,' the Navy's Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) said in a statement to TWZ earlier today. We have reached out for further clarification about whether the two-seat Super Hornet was acting as the tanker and/or whether it was linked to another aircraft at the time of the shoot down. The Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Gettysburg. USN USS Gettysburg engaged and brought down the F/A-18F on December 22 local time, according to a previously released statement from U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM). Gettysburg and CVW-1 are both currently assigned to the Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group. Truman, its air wing, and its escorts had just entered the Red Sea last week. The strike group is currently supporting operations to protect and friendly military assets from attacks by Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen, including strikes ashore.

'Initial assessments indicate that one of the crew members sustained minor injuries. This incident was not the result of hostile fire, and a full investigation is underway.' 'Pilots' here looks to be a misnomer. The individual flying in the backseat of an F/A-18F is typically a Weapon Systems Officer (WSO), not a second pilot, and this was reportedly the case in this instance, according to The Washington Post's Dan Lamothe. Lamothe also reported, citing an anonymous military official, that a Standard Missile-2 (SM-2) was the weapon Gettysburg fired that brought down the Super Hornet, that the two crew members had both suffered minor injuries, and that the Navy considering whether or not to recover the wreckage. 3) Navy was assessing Sunday whether to salvage any of the downed jet, and how. 4) The two aviators are back aboard the aircraft carrier Truman with minor injuries. Those would not be uncommon after an ejection.&mdash; Dan Lamothe (@DanLamothe) December 22, 2024 The SM-2 family is a key element of the Navy's arsenal of ship-launched surface-to-air missiles. Since October 2023, SM-2s have been weapons of choice for U.S. naval forces in the Middle East for engaging Houthi missiles and drones. In addition, Ticonderoga class cruisers currently act as the central air and missile defense node for Navy carrier strike group. Whether or not to attempt to retrieve any portion of the downed F/A-18F will be an important question for the Navy. As TWZ has highlighted many times in the past, adversaries could try to do the same and glean useful intelligence from whatever they recover. When it comes to refueling mission, F/A-18 Super Hornets are currently routinely employed as tankers for other aircraft in Navy carrier air wings, typically flying stable orbits relatively close to the strike group for recovery operations, but are also used to refuel jets after launch or on their way to their objectives. They execute this in the '5-wet' configuration, with four 480-gallon fuel tanks and a centerline hose-and-drogue refueling pod. The services plans to supplant Super Hornets in this role with a new fleet of MQ-25 Stingray aerial refueling drones, which will also have secondary intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities and could take on other missions in the future. Unfortunately, the MQ-25 program has been beset by delays and other issues and Stingrays are not expected to begin flying operational missions until at least 2026. Land-based tanker aircraft also regularly support Navy carrier-based aircraft. While few other details regarding this past weekend’s friendly fire incident have emerged, a lot of things can go wrong and cause fratricide in such an environment, according to Bradley Martin, a retired Surface Warfare Officer (SWO) who spent two-thirds of his 30-year Navy career at sea. 'Aircraft might not have had its identification on,' he told TWZ Monday. 'The profile that was being reported in the Aegis system might have looked like a threat, so the operators are looking at it and trying to determine what they’re seeing and make a decision in fairly short order.' Battle management combat systems like Aegis are not perfect, Martin said. 'They occasionally misreport things or cause dual tracks, or they’ll not correctly identify something,' he continued, adding that sometimes it’s a combination of equipment and operator error. Near-misses happen 'all the time,' Martin added, where an operator is looking at a screen and trying to figure out what they are seeing in a very short period of time. 'Especially when you’re dealing with a wartime environment,' he noted. ‘The Navy’s fired a lot of missiles in the last year, more than it has in decades.' TWZ has previously noted how the Houthi's very active campaign targeting ships in and around the Red Sea, combined with the congested nature of the operating environment in the region, raises the risks of accidental shootdowns. Just in February, a German Navy warship sailing in the Red Sea fired on a U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone, but did not bring it down, in a case of mistaken identity. There are many other instances of aircraft being accidentally damaged or shot down, especially in the midst of active conflicts. The now-decommissioned Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Vincennes was involved in a particularly infamous incident in the midst of the Iran-Iraq War in 1988 where it shot down Iran Air Flight 655, killing everyone onboard. Issues with the Aegis Combat System's user interface at the time, as well as stress, timing, and confusion, have been cited as contributing factors. Thanks to a major upgrade program, the Aegis system on Gettysburg is one of the most modern currently in service, as you can read more about here. Unlike Vincennes in 1988, the cruiser also has the benefit of a much more advanced overall sensor suite with deep networking and sensor fusion capabilities on top of its far more advanced Aegis system. Decades of evolutionary enhancements have made it a very different combination of capabilities than it was nearly four decades ago. At the same time, we don't know what systems were operating on the ship at the time of the friendly fire incident this weekend or what other sources of data, such as from an E-2 Hawkeye airborne early warning and control aircraft and other ships in the region, that might have been available to feed into the crew's overall picture of the battlespace. E-2 Hawkeye airborne early warning and control aircraft. Northrop Grumman As the retired SWO Martin highlighted, the current situation U.S. forces are contending with in the Red Sea is an extremely high-threat environment with multiple layers of threats, some of which can be very hard to detect and categorize. The Houthis are actively targeting American warships, as well as commercial vessels, with various aerial drones, cruise missiles, anti-ship ballistic missiles and unmanned surface vessels, often simultaneously. The available time in which to make potentially serious decisions can be measured in seconds. The friendly fire incident also shined a new and unwelcome light on the Ticonderoga class's woes, including when it comes the much-maligned modernization program for a handful of the remaining ships. The original plan had been to substantially upgrade 11 of the cruisers, which would serve in the 2030s. The Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Chosin seen in the process of being upgraded. USN However, as it stands now, only three Ticonderogas will be modernized – USS Gettysburg, USS Chosin, and USS Cape St. George – and they may only deploy once more each before their scheduled decommissioning dates in the coming years. A report from GAO, a Congressional watchdog, published earlier this month, described the cruiser modernization effort as a poster child for how not to run such an effort, saying that around $1.84 billion had been wasted on modifications to ships that never returned to sea. The report also highlighted issues with Gettysburg, specifically, post-modernization and in the run-up to its current deployment. 'USS Gettysburg completed its modernization, including sea trials, in February 2023. The Navy’s Board of Inspection and Survey determined the ship meets the minimum standard to get to sea,' according to GAO. 'However, in January 2024 the Navy’s Board of Inspection and Survey identified several outstanding issues during an inspection of the ship’s condition. For example, several elements of the weapons systems were inoperable or degraded and there were structural issues throughout the ship. Since the inspection, the Navy has addressed several of these issues and the ship completed 18 days at sea in June 2024 in preparation for deployment. During this time at sea, USS Gettysburg completed a successful missile launch and intercept using its updated combat systems software.' 'The Navy deployed USS Gettysburg in September 2024 with its carrier strike group. Prior to the deployment, the ship’s crew told us that parts continued to be a problem, including steering gears and hydraulic power unit solenoid valves, among others,' GAO's report added. 'To address this problem, the Navy used parts from the decommissioned cruisers. According to the ship’s crew, propulsion plant and electric system failures were key concerns for the USS Gettysburg deployment.' A view of USS Gettysburg from the ship's bow in October 2024. USN Petty Officer 2nd Class Kaitlin Young GAO said that the Navy was looking to see how Gettysburg performed on its latest deployment before making any decisions about whether to send it out again before decommissioning it. The service has long said now that the Ticonderoga class as a whole has become increasingly unreliable and the ships have been suffering from hull cracking and other structural issues for years already. It is important to stress again that the chain of events that led to Gettysburg bringing down the Super Hornet over the Red Sea remains unknown, including whether or not any issues with the ship itself played a role. 'This kind of mistake sadly is almost inevitable,' Martin, the retired SWO, told TWZ. 'A sky full of aircraft, some friendly, a lot not friendly, ships trying to sort out occasionally ambiguous situations under a great deal of time pressure. These things will almost inevitably occur.' Martin said everyone should recognize that these things can and do happen in an intense enough combat environment, and that the Navy needs to be transparent about what happened. 'The public, the media, me, would be willing to accept that these things happen, this was an accident and [the Navy] has done something to prevent it,' he said. 'Fortunately, in this case, it wasn’t a tragedy, it was just a loss of an expensive airplane.' The Navy is just at the start of its investigation into the friendly fire incident over the week and more details about exactly what happened could emerge as that effort gets more underway. As Martin notes, in this instance, thankfully the two aviators onboard the F/A-18F were able to safely eject.

Massive Uptick In Official Drone Sightings By Nuclear Power Plant...	The number of drone flyovers of nuclear plants for the entire year nearly doubled in one week, from December 10th to December 17th, according to data provided to The War Zone by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Between Jan. 1 and Dec.10, nuclear facility licensees reported a total of 15 drone events. As of about 1 p.m. Dec., 17, that number had jumped to 26, NRC spokesman Dave McIntyre told The War Zone on Friday in response to our query. While the timeline overlaps with a rash of drone sightings across the country and especially in the New Jersey area - including over military installations and energy infrastructure - it is unclear at the moment what, if any, connection there is to the dramatic increase in suspicious drone events over nuclear facilities. Salem Nuclear Power Plant (L, two domes) and Hope Creek Nuclear Generating Station reported a drone flyover on Dec. 14. It is one of 26 across the nation to have reported such an incident. (STAN HONDA/AFP via Getty Images) STAN HONDA '&#8230;before January 2024, nuclear power plant licensees voluntarily reported flyovers by uncrewed aerial systems, such as drones, to the Federal Aviation Administration; law enforcement (local and the FBI); and the NRC,' McIntyre told The War Zone. 'Because reporting was voluntary, our information may not reflect the total number of UAS overflights of nuclear power plants.' Once a flyover is reported, he added, 'the NRC provides the specifics to other agencies for follow-up, including the FBI. The NRC does not investigate this type of activity once it has been reported.' We reached out to the NRC, FBI, FAA and Department of Homeland Security for more context about these flyovers. We will update this story with any pertinent information provided. The most recent publicly known drone sightings were over the Public Service Energy & Gas (PSEG) Nuclear Salem and Hope Creek generating stations, located at Lower Alloways Creek Township, in Salem County, New Jersey. 'Yes, drones were seen in the vicinity of Salem and Hope Creek (they’re the same site) last weekend,' NRC spokesperson Diane Screnci told us on Dec. 20. She did not provide a specific date, but a PSE&G spokesperson issued a statement saying that a flyover occurred on Dec 14.

(STAN HONDA/AFP via Getty Images) STAN HONDA The Hope Creek generation station, which produces nearly half of the state's energy, was one of 22 facilities to have its airspace banned to drones by the Federal Aviation Administration on Dec. 18. You can see the full list of sites where the FAA issued temporary flight restrictions (TFR) in our story about that here. 'While DHS and our federal partners continue to see no evidence of a threat, the purpose of the TFR is to discourage drone flights around these areas, as requested by the critical infrastructure partners,' DHS said in a statement on Dec. 19. 'DHS and other security partners routinely request the FAA establish TFRs to restrict drone flights in areas where the drones could be unsafe or pose a security risk.' The restrictions affect drones operating below 400 feet and last until Jan. 17. There is always the possibility that the timeline could be extended or additional communities have their airspace similarly closed. Notice To Airmen (NOTAM) warning of TFRs for drone flights over the Hope Creek generation station (FAA) On Friday, the FAA issued 68 more TFRs across New York state. As with the New Jersey TFRs, these banned drone flights over energy infrastructure. 'At the request of federal security partners, the FAA published 30 Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs) prohibiting drone flights over critical New York infrastructure,' the FAA told us after the first 30 were issued. Another 38 were ordered later on Friday. 'On the NY TRFs, would refer you back to our statement and background we provided on the NJ TFRs,' DHS told us on Friday. 'We continue to assess there is no public safety threat relating to the reported drone sightings, and like in NJ, the FAA issued temporary flight restrictions over some critical infrastructure facilities in NY out of an abundance of caution.' Screenshot The day before, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul told the media that the action was 'purely precautionary; there are no threats to these sites.' Like the New Jersey TFRs, these ban virtually all drone operations below 400 feet in a one-mile radius. The restrictions last until Jan. 18. The FAA provided locations for the first 30 of those: Farragut Substation - Brooklyn, NY 4/9171 E 13th St. Substation - New York, NY 4/9167 EF Barrett Substation - Oceanside, NY 4/9192 Goethals Substation - Staten Island, NY 4/9186 Fresh Kills Substation - Staten Island, NY 4/9180 Roslyn Substation – Roslyn Heights, NY 4/9189 Newbridge Rd.

Substation – Glenwood Landing, NY 4/9214 Drone flights over nuclear facilities have been increasing over the years, nearly doubling from the 12 reported in 2019 to 23 reported last year, according to the data provided to us by the NRC. NRC In September 2019, America’s most powerful nuclear plant, the Palo Verde Nuclear Generation Station near Tonopah, Arizona experienced a rash of drone overflights. In a trove of documents and internal correspondences related to the event, NRC officials described the incident as a 'drone-a-palooza' and said that it highlighted concerns about the potential for a future 'adversarial attack' involving small unmanned aircraft and the need for defenses against them. You can read more about this from our exclusive story at the time here. The Palo Verde Nuclear Generation Station experienced several drone flyovers in September 2019. (Google Earth) The drastic increase in drones reported to be flying over nuclear power plants comes amid a growing frenzy over mysterious objects in the sky that came after we broke the story about incursions over Picatinny Arsenal in northern New Jersey. The FBI has stated that out of some 5,000 sighting reports, fewer than 100 merited further investigation. Still, the hysteria over drones has grown to the point where the FBI and New Jersey State Police had to plead with the public not to shoot lasers or bullets into the sky at any object flying overhead. The warning was not hypothetical. Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst officials told The War Zone that pilots of 15 fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft from Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst had reported being struck by lasers from the ground since Dec. 7. One of those pilots had to seek medical treatment but was quickly released, but all aircraft involved landed safely. All this comes as drone incursions are being reported over military bases at home and abroad. Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton in southern California confirmed to The War Zone on Tuesday that it had experienced multiple such incidents over its airspace in the past several days. It joins a growing list of military installations in the United States experiencing recent drone incursions, that also includes Hill Air Force Base in Utah, which reported drone incursions on Monday. Drones have also flown over Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio forcing the closure of its airspace, which we were the first to report and they intruded on Naval Weapon Station Earle’s airspace and several unknown aircraft recently followed a Coast Guard vessel. The airspace over Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio was closed earlier this month because of drone incursions. (Public domain) Last month, drones also appeared over four U.S. Air Force bases in the U.K., another story we first broke, and more recently also over Ramstein Air Base in Germany. Drone incursions over key U.S. bases and training ranges are nothing new, and The War Zone has been on the leading edge of covering this topic for years. TWZ broke the story of the major drone incursions over Langley AFB a year ago, which marked a major change in how the DoD was approaching this neglected threat. Other such incursions involving UAS have taken place off the U.S. coasts and, as well as military bases, key civilian infrastructure has also been visited by mysterious drones. As we have reported on repeatedly, including the aforementioned Palo Verde incident, drones pose a danger to energy infrastructure and nefarious and bizarre drone activity at such sites has been an ongoing issue. What appeared to be the first actual drone attack on a power facility in the U.S. happened in 2020, which raised red flags in the intelligence community. The large recent increase in drone flyovers is deeply concerning for several reasons. Even small drones can deliver payloads able to cause damage and flying over these sites can provide insights into security protocols and responses, as well as network vulnerabilities and more. While we don’t know for sure that there is any connection between the recent spike in nuclear site flyovers and the ongoing drone frenzy, there is certainly more attention being put on what is going on in the skies over these plants due to a the massive news story unfolding in New Jersey. But it clearly still merits further examination. We will stay on top of this situation and provide updates when warranted.

Ukrainian M1 Abrams Commander Talks Tank’s Major Vulnerabilities,...	Last week, several Russian first-person view (FPV) drones struck a U.S.-made M1A1 Abrams tank in the Kursk region, but the crew was able to survive. The vehicle’s commander lauded the American armor for saving their lives, but also highlighted some major vulnerabilities it has on today's drone-drenched battlefield. In particular he offered important insights on how Ukraine is adapting its M1s to survive — lessons that could prove very valuable for the U.S. Army in future conflicts. The drone attack was 'the first time that the crew survived multiple hits while inside a disabled Abrams,' the tank commander told Rob Lee (@RALee85), a senior fellow with the Foreign Policy Research Institute, and Michael Kofman (@KofmanMichael), a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment. 'Actually, there were 4-6 direct hits. The crew survived, and even without injuries. God bless America.' A video of that attack, by an FPV drone with a fiber optic cable, was posted on Russian telegram channels. It showed the Abrams rumbling down a snow-dusted roadway and then cut to it being struck by an FPV drone, which disabled the tank. The video then shows another FPV drone strike on the left side side just below the turret. All the strikes came within about two minutes, the commander, who is with the 47th Separate Mechanized Brigade, told Lee and Kofman. Russian telegram channels posted videos of fiber optic cable FPV strikes on a Ukrainian Abrams tank in Kursk oblast last week. Aside from a concussion, the crew survived without injury and made it back to friendly lines. @KofmanMichael and I spoke to the commander of the tank… pic.twitter.com/piqapqvVMv&mdash; Rob Lee (@RALee85) December 19, 2024 The crew survived thanks to a combination of the Abrams’ design and modifications the Ukrainians made after learning battlefield lessons the hard way, the commander explained. Unlike Soviet-era tanks, Abrams was designed with the ammunition stored in the hull, not the turret, offering far greater protection for crews. 'Thanks to the fact that the ammo is completely separated from the crew, the crew has a chance to survive (unlike in the T series tanks),' the commander exclaimed. 'The Abrams is a great tank.' A seemingly endless stream of videos have appeared online showing Russian tanks experiencing what has been colloquially referred to as 'turret tosses' as the stored munitions inside its hull explode, sending the turrets flying into the air. You can see an example of that in the following video. One of the most epic turret tosses by a Russian tank, presumably T-90M pic.twitter.com/kPeKZFzYNW&mdash; Special Kherson Cat (@bayraktar_1love) November 23, 2024 The tank also 'had a unique 'cope cage' (actually, 'cope netting') and a lot more ERA than an average Abrams,' the commander explained. 'At least one' of the drones 'got stuck in the net. Two more missed several minutes before. They apparently hit the engine. They were unable to penetrate either the turret or the hull elsewhere while we were inside.' 'Without the additional ERA and 'cope netting' on top of the turret, we would have been smashed and surely dead by now without any chance,' the commander extolled. While militaries around the globe have began integrating 'cope cages' and other anti-drone screens on their armor, the U.S. has not followed suit, at least yet. This tank, which belonged to the Ukrainian 47th Separate Mechanized Brigade, survived FPV drones strikes in large measure because of the netting added to the turret. (Twitter screencap) Twitter screencap The commander offered several more takeaways about the Abrams. 'The most valuable advantage of the Abrams is that, when having much additional armor and a thorough approach, it saves human lives, even in dire conditions,' he noted. 'If the U.S. provided the tanks with the original armor and the complete [M-19 Abrams Reactive Armor Tiles (ARAT)] kits, this would make us more protected (although the top would still remain unprotected and we would need Kontakt-1, etc.),' he posited, adding some advice for the Pentagon. 'The American tankers should act promptly,' he urged. 'Their tanks are too thin and vulnerable given the current threats on the battlefield. Protect your tanks urgently to avoid losses in potential near-future conflicts, taking into account our experience.' A Russian drone operator prepares an FPV drone with a munition for launching. (Twitter screencap) The commander also dismissed concerns that the Abrams would be too heavy, even more so with two to three tons of additional weight from the added ERA tiles. In addition, he confirmed that Ukraine did not receive the latest version of the Abrams and they were sent the export version without depleted uranium armor. Before receiving their tanks, the 47th spent time training how to use them in Germany. The commander said while they were able to fire off a lot of rounds, the U.S. troops conducting that training did not have a full understanding of the challenges Ukraine would face fighting Russia. 'Well, we got a luxurious shooting practice (around 100 rounds fired by each gunner) and some good overall knowledge about the tank,' he explained. 'But the American instructors AND military were completely unaware of the modern battlefield threats. And still are unaware (I communicate with some of the American tankers and try to share information with them).' For example, the commander said his trainers 'are shocked that Russians can see us at night with thermal-vision recon drones (we were taught that we would be haunting the Russians who are blind at night), they do not understand at all the threat posed by the FPVs, etc.' You can see a Ukrainian journalist's report on that training in the video below.

They were first seen in combat in February and the first images of one that was destroyed appeared online three days later. In August, Australia promised to send 49 Abrams tanks to Ukraine. Ukraine has lost at least 17 Abrams, according to the Oryx open-source tracking group. Of those, at least eight were destroyed, one damaged, seven damaged and abandoned and one captured. The actual figures are likely higher in reality because Oryx only tabulates losses for which it has visual confirmation.

(Via Twitter) The Ukrainian Abrams tank that was said to have been attacked near Avdiivka as viewed from the top down through a handheld controller for a drone. via X After the crew abandoned the Abrams, 'Russian FPV crews hit the tank with several more FPVs…but the tank was not destroyed and might still be salvageable,' the commander said. 'Because of recent advances, Russian forces may capture it.' The commander and his crew made it back to friendly lines on foot. 'It was close to the Russian positions,' he noted. 'We could not evacuate because the FPVs were coming one after another. When I finally could hear no sound, we just jumped out of the tank and ran to a treeline. They were tracking us, so a mortar started working with some more drones, but we crawled away through the treeline. In the end, in a spot still under FPV control, our company commander rushed in and took us away.' Despite its flaws, imperfect training and combat under conditions never imagined, the Abrams tank is a hit with its crews. 'We&#8230;are in love with this tank and are immensely grateful to the United States,' the commander said.

Russia’s Belbek Air Base In Crimea Is Getting Hardened Aircraft S...	Recent satellite imagery of Belbek Air Base, near Sevastopol in Russian-occupied Crimea, shows new hardened aircraft shelters and additional construction to help shield aircraft from drone attacks and other indirect fire. This reflects a broader push by the Russian military to improve physical defenses at multiple airfields two and a half years after the launch of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The War Zone obtained the satellite image of Belbek, seen below, which was taken on December 19, from Planet Labs. Roughly ten hardened shelters can be seen in various stages of construction over existing aircraft parking spots at the central portion of the facility. Another structure, the purpose of which is unclear, but that looks hardened, is also seen being built at a separate portion of the base. PHOTO © 2024 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Additional latticework for less-well-protected soft shelters is also visible on an open apron at the center of the base, as well as across from the other structure that is being built. Similar structures have been seen at other Russian air bases in the past.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION A close-up of the other hardened structure being built at Belbek, as well as the additional shelters or netting across from it. PHOTO © 2024 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Additional physical defenses at Belbek make good sense. The base has been a notably high-priority target for Ukraine since the aircraft and air defenses based there help provide critical screening for the nearby Russian naval base at Sevastopol and also extend this coverage far out into the Black Sea. In addition to drone attacks, Ukrainian forces have employed U.S.-suppled Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) short-range ballistic missiles with cluster munition warheads against the facility. The base suffered a notably destructive ATACMS barrage in May of this year. Belbek is not the only Russian base that faces Ukrainian threats and there have been growing signs of Russian efforts particularly to shield highly vulnerable aircraft currently parked out on open flight lines from attack. Around September of this year, the first evidence began to appear in Russia of efforts to protect Flanker-series combat aircraft, which had previously been left exposed on their bases. While protective structures do exist on certain Russian air bases, the large dimensions of the Flanker mean that these aircraft were never provided with suitable hardened aircraft shelters. The only exceptions were in Poland and the former East Germany, and in some of the European Soviet republics — but not in Russia. In the second half of November, various satellite images published on social media documented the construction of hardening of hardened aircraft shelters at several Russian military airfields. These include Kursk, Akhtubinsk, Primorsko-Akhtarsk, Yeysk, Morozovsk, Millerovo, and Krymsk — now joined by Belbek. It appears that the construction of at least 70 ‘Flanker bunkers’ began at almost the same time. It quickly became clear that a concerted construction program was underway, the scope of which finds parallels with the rapid efforts to harden airfields across Eastern and Western Europe after the dramatic success of the Israeli Air Force in the 1967 Six-Day War. A Ukrainian research project, Frontelligence Insight, provided what may have been the first definitive publicly available evidence of new Russian bunker construction, in the form of a satellite photo taken at Kursk-Khalino Air Base on October 22. Here, for example, excavation work for the foundations, the provision of prefabricated concrete parts, and initial assembly work were all clearly visible.

Not only were critical airfields not equipped with protective structures, but there were no such hardened aircraft shelters suitable for the Flanker series in Russia. A satellite image taken in June of this year after a drone attack on Akhtubinsk Air Base shows damage to one and possibly two Su-57 new-generation fighters parked out in the open. Satellite image ©2024 Maxar Technologies While bombers operated by Russia's Long-Range Aviation branch were moved to — supposedly — safer bases deeper within Russia, tactical Su-24, Su-25, Su-30SM/M2, Su-34, and Su-35S aircraft remained primarily at their operational bases. However, they relocated every few months to other airfields within the operational area and sometimes even further away from the front line. Anti-aircraft defenses were set up at the edge of airfields, discarded aircraft were arranged as decoys and temporary blast walls were erected to protect against shrapnel and other fragments. More unorthodox measures included placing car tires on the upper surfaces of aircraft and painting aircraft silhouettes on concrete airfield surfaces. The tires, specifically, were intended to confuse image-matching seekers on Ukrainian missiles like the British-supplied Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missiles and nearly identical SCALP-EGs from France.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION On the whole, this mix of countermeasures to Ukrainian long-range strikes was largely ineffective. After all, it didn’t include adequate hardened aircraft shelters — admittedly, the most expensive solution, but also the best. With each successful Ukrainian airstrike, the stunned comments and unsparing assessments from the Russian military information space became harder to ignore. During an interview in July of this year, the Russian Minister of Defense Andrey Belousov provided assurance that 'a schedule for airfields has already been drawn up and shelters will definitely be built.' This report was picked up by Ukrainian analysts, who quickly assessed that such a project would be extremely expensive — roughly $1 billion for 300 AU-19 hardened aircraft shelters of the kind that can accommodate Flankers. The AU-19 is a standardized Soviet shelter pattern developed around the Flanker during the Cold War, but, as noted, wasn’t ever built inside Russia. The Ukrainian analysts concluded that Russia was unlikely to make this investment and would instead build shelters made of sheet steel at best, which would provide little more than weather protection. This statement was true to the extent that a dozen such shelters were built in the winter of 2023-24 at Marinovka Air Base, located close together in a straight line, alongside the reserve taxiway. By July 2024, the second construction phase at Marinovka had begun, resulting in another dozen shelters, but this time in a more dispersed form. A successful Ukrainian attack on Marinovka meant this construction work was never completed. In fact, the raid on Marinovka was probably a major factor behind the decision to build true hardened aircraft shelters, with work starting only a few weeks later. A metal hangar at Marinovka Air Base in Russia shows extensive shrapnel damage after a Ukrainian drone strike. via Telegram Another factor was almost certainly the expectation that the Biden administration would allow Ukraine to use U.S.-produced and donated ATACMS to hit targets deep inside Russia. These missiles can hit targets of up to about 190 miles away and their use in this capacity was approved on November 17. Roughly a week later, Ukraine used ATACMS in an attack on Kursk-Khalino Air Base, about 60 miles from the Ukrainian border. The need to provide adequate protection to aircraft — especially for the U.S. military — is something that The War Zone has addressed before. Aircraft shelters with varying degrees of hardening now very much back on the agenda globally, in response to evolving drone and missile threats. There is a growing debate within America's armed forces and Congress about the value of building new defensive infrastructure for its aircraft, as well as investments in new active air and missile defense and tactics, techniques, and procures. With the exception of a few forward deployment locations, the United States does not invest in robust shelters for its combat aircraft. The Russian experience from the war in Ukraine suggests that could be a mistake. At this point, it’s worth returning to the aforementioned AU-19 hardened aircraft shelter. The AU-19 design reflected the Soviet expectation that an air war with NATO would be fought over the Central Front, with tactical aviation moving rapidly forward to keep pace with armored thrusts, with aircraft operating from bases closer to the front lines, as well as from captured airfields and improvised airstrips. A Su-27 prepares to depart an air base in Poland, where it was stationed at the end of the Cold War, to go back to Russia, in July 1992. Soviet-operated air bases in Poland were among those to feature hardened aircraft shelters for Flanker-series fighters — seen here in the background. Rob Schleiffert/Wikimedia Commons There are actually two AU-19 subdesigns. According to the Soviet designation scheme, AU-19/1 is a shelter with classic three-walled external sliding gates, while AU-19/2 has internal hinged gates, analogous to those used in certain first-generation NATO hardened aircraft shelters. However, the new Flanker bunkers now appearing in Russia use a different design principle. For the sake of convenience, we can refer to them as AU-19/3. There are only a few images currently available showing the excavation pits for the foundations of the new shelters, their outer structures, building materials, and assembly processes. However, none of these suggest the AU-19/3 is in any way equivalent to the original AU-19. The degree of protection probably lies somewhere between a classic hardened aircraft shelter and the kind of sheet-metal shelters seen at Marinovka. A closer look at sheet-metal type of aircraft shelters at Marinovka, before the successful Ukrainian drone attack. Google Earth Stefan Büttner, an expert in Russian airbase infrastructure, told The War Zone that an AU-19/3 might just be able to withstand a hit from a drone armed with a 220-pound FAB-100 bomb, 'but anything more than that would inevitably lead to the collapse of the bunker itself in the event of a direct hit.' 'Based on the information currently available, the arched trusses used — presumably consisting of steel profile frames with concrete elements on top and a possible earth covering — give an impression of a construction that is far too fragile.' This leads to the question of why Russia didn’t simply ‘reissue’ the comparatively robust AU-19 dating from the 1980s. The design plans for the AU-19 are easily accessible and Russia has dozens of precast concrete factories whose product ranges reveal their Soviet origins. Perhaps, after all, it was simply a matter of cost that led to the current solution. Still, the ability to protect from lighter strikes, like those delivered by drones and cluster munitions, is extremely relevant and balancing cost versus the most widespread threats does make some sense.

F-35B And F-35C Use Different 25mm Gun Pods Unique To Each Varian...	It's no secret that the B and C variants of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter lack an internal 25mm cannon like the A version. Instead, they rely on belly-mounted pods to provide gun capability. What's perhaps less well known is that the gun pods for the F-35B and the F-35C are not identical and are not interchangeable due to the substantial structural differences between those aircraft. The fact of the existence of F-35B and F-35C-specific gun pods – designated GPU-9/A and GPU-8/A, respectively – is highlighted in a recent U.S. military contracting notice about plans to purchase more of both types from General Dynamics. Both pod types contain a single four-barrelled 25mm Gatling-type GAU-22/A cannon and 220 rounds of ammunition. Some sources have previously described the GPU-8/A as a 30mm gun pod developed for the F-16-series, but this appears to be a case of confusion with the GPU-5/A pod and its GAU-13/A derivative of the famed GAU-8/A Avenger cannon found on the A-10 Warthog. A US Marine Corps F-35C armed with a gun pod prepares to launch from the USS Abraham Lincoln during the RIMPAC 2022 exercise. USN A heavily redacted declassified copy of a report on the Joint Strike Fighter program that the Project on Government Oversight (POGO), an independent nonprofit, obtained and published back in November, further confirms that there are two pods and that they are not interchangeable. The Pentagon's Office of the Director of Test and Evaluation produced the report, which is dated February 2024. 'A podded version of the GAU-22/A is available for the F-35B and F-35C, which is externally carried on the centerline station of these aircraft,' an unredacted portion of the report. 'Differences in the outer mold-line fairing mount make the gun pods unique to each variant (i.e. an F-35B gun pod cannot be mounted on an F-35C aircraft).' As already noted, the GPU-8/A and the GPU-9/A do both contain the same gun and the same amount of ammunition. From available pictures, outwardly the two pods look virtually the same, but beyond that, what the total level of commonality between them might be is unclear. The War Zone has reached out to the F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO) for more details. A nearly 20-year-old General Dynamics briefing slide showing a single design of a podded 'gun system' for the short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) version and carrier variant (CV) of the F-35 (or F-35B and F-35C, respectively). General Dynamics Another General Dynamics briefing slide on the GAU-22/A cannon, shown here in the context of its internal mounting on the F-35A. General Dynamics The podded guns do appear to have largely escaped the serious problems the internally-mounted GAU-22/A has faced over the years. Issues linked to the helmet-mounted displays (HMD) that pilots use when flying all F-35 variants had impacted gun effectiveness across the board in the past, but are said to have been resolved. You can read more about F-35A's gun-related woes here. A U.S. Marine Corps F-35B was damaged in 2021 after a 25mm shell exploded shortly after leaving the muzzle of its podded gun, but the exact circumstances behind that mishap are unclear. That same year, another Marine F-35B, operating from the Royal Navy's carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth at the time, reportedly landed at Kadena Air Base in Japan due to unspecified issues with its gun pod. If nothing else, the fact that there are two gun pods for the F-35 series highlights the significant differences between the B and C variants, as well as the A model. There is only approximately 20 percent parts commonality between the three versions of the Joint Strike Fighter despite their external looks and shared development. The short takeoff and vertical landing capable F-35B is particularly unique with its integrated lift fan, articulating exhaust nozzle, and substantially lightened core structure, as well as its smaller internal weapons bays than either the A or C. The B's design also necessitates the inclusion of an automatic ejection system that you can read more about here. The variant-specific gun pods also underscore the maintenance, logistics, and sustainment issues caused by the very limited commonality between F-35 variants. The lack of interchangeability means that units flying F-35B and Cs notably cannot leverage a common pool, at least when it comes to complete pods. The War Zone has previously explored in great detail extremely worrisome spare parts and related supply chain issues facing the F-35, exacerbated by differences in the three versions, which could have serious operational impacts, especially during a sustained high-end fight in a vast battlespace. The often convoluted nature of the logistics ecosystem around the Joint Strike Fighter has created hurdles even for exercises and other routine peacetime deployments. The U.S. military is well aware of these issues, but has long struggled in addressing them. In the meantime, the Pentagon will have to contend with the realities that the differences between the F-35 variants impose, including the fact that they all have unique gun systems.

Russia Pummels Kyiv In Retaliation For ATACMS, Storm Shadow Strik...	Russia carried out another deadly wave of missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian cities which it claims was in retaliation for the use of Western-donated long-range weapons on its territory. There was at least one death and several injuries in Kyiv, deaths in Kherson, injuries and damage in Kryvyi Rih and tens of thousands left without power on a frigid winter night. 'Today at around 7 a.m., the Russian armed forces launched a combined missile strike on Kyiv,' regional military administrator Serhiy Popko said on Telegram. 'The enemy probably used ballistic missiles. As a result of this strike, debris was recorded falling in three districts of the city. As of now, one person has died and 11 have been injured as a result of a rocket attack on the capital, five of whom were hospitalized, and the others were treated on the spot by medics.'

'The enemy struck with an Iskander-M ballistic missile from the Rostov region, a Kh-59/69 guided aircraft missile from the airspace of the Kursk region, and 65 Shahed attack UAVs and drones of other types from the Bryansk, Millerovo, Orel, Primorsko-Akhtarsk regions - Russia,' the Air Force stated on Telegram. 'The air attack was repelled by aviation, anti-aircraft missile troops, electronic warfare units, and mobile fire groups of the Air Force and the Defense Forces of Ukraine,' the Air Force claimed, adding that '40 Shahed attack UAVs and other types of drones have been shot down in Kursk, Poltava, Sumy, Kyiv, Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhia regions.' 'As a result of the nighttime missile and drone strike, private and apartment buildings, medical facilities, warehouses, and farms in the Dnipropetrovsk, Sumy, Kyiv, and Kharkiv regions were hit,' the Air Force proffered. The Ukrainian Air Force says Russia launched 6 Iskander-M / KN-23 ballistic missiles (5 of which were launched at Kyiv), a Kh-59 / 69 missile, and 65 Shahed and other UAVs overnight. Ukraine's State Emergency Service says at least one person has died and nine were injured.… pic.twitter.com/WaLLCqO4u8&mdash; Rob Lee (@RALee85) December 20, 2024 The Russian Defense Ministry (MOD) claimed the attacks were retaliation for a Dec. 18 Ukrainian strike on the Rostov region using U.S.-produced Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) short-range ballistic missiles and U.K.-donated Storm Shadow air-based cruise missiles. The missile strike at the Kombinat Kamensky enterprise in Rostov region was carried out by six ATACMS and four Storm Shadows, the MoD stated. 'This morning, in response to the actions of the Kyiv regime supported by Western countries, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation delivered a group strike by long-range precision weaponry at a command post of the Security Service of Ukraine, the Luch Design Bureau, which develops and manufactures Neptune missile systems and Olkha MLRS ground-based cruise missiles, as well as hit positions of a Patriot SAM system,' the MoD claimed on Telegram. The War Zone cannot independently confirm those claims. The Kombinat Kamensky plant produces rocket fuels used in various weapons ranging from the Kornet anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) to the Iskander-M ballistic missile, according to the Ukrainian Militarnyi news outlet. Though Russia routinely carries out missile attacks across Ukraine, the Russian MoD vowed revenge strikes on the Kombinat Kamensky plant right after the attack. 'These actions of the Kyiv regime, supported by Western curators, will not remain unanswered,' the Russian MoD stressed at the time. The threat of retaliation by Russia was one of the reasons given by the Biden administration for its reluctance to allow Ukraine to use ATACMS inside Russia, a nuclear power. However, after a long debate, it finally gave the green light for such attacks on Nov. 17, which you can read more about here. The policy change was spurred by the presence of North Korean troops fighting in Kursk, U.S. officials said. The U.K. approved the use of Storm Shadows in Russia back in May. This all comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened to use his new Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile on Kyiv to conduct a technology duel with Western-donated air defense systems. You can read much more about that later in this story. The Latest On the battlefield, while fighting continued to rage in Russia’s Kursk region and across the east of Ukraine, little territory was gained or lost. Moscow’s forces, however, are getting closer to Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region. Here are the key takeaways from the latest Institute for the Study of War assessment. Kursk: ​​Fighting continued in the main Ukrainian salient in Kursk Oblast on December 18, but there were no confirmed advances. Kharkiv: Russian forces recently marginally advanced in the Kharkiv direction amid continued offensive operations in the area on December 18. Luhansk: Russian forces recently marginally advanced in the Kupyansk and Kreminna directions amid continued offensive operations along the Kupyansk-Svatove-Kreminna line on December 18. Donetsk: Russian forces continued offensive operations toward Siversk, Chasiv Yar, Kurakhove, Vuhledar and near Velyka Novosilka on December 18 but did not make any confirmed advances. Both Ukrainian and Russian forces recently advanced near Toretsk. Russian forces also recently advanced near Pokrovsk. Zaporizhzhia: Russian forces continued assaults in western Zaporizhia Oblast near Novoandriivka (northwest of Robotyne) and Novodanylivka and in the direction of Orikhiv (both north of Robotyne) on December 17 and 18 but did not make confirmed advances. Kherson: Russian forces continued assaults in the Dnipro River direction, including in the east (left) bank in Kherson Oblast, on December 17 and 18 but did not make confirmed advances.

Russia is nearing victory, said Putin, for a variety of reasons. '&#8230;the advance is not by 100, 200, or 300 meters. Our fighting men are regaining the territory by square kilometers. I want to stress – every day! Why is this happening?' 'First, last year, and this basically is the classical course of hostilities, the enemy attacks, sustains a heavy defeat, loses a lot of equipment, ammunition and personnel, and then the other side starts to push forward. In our case, this is happening exactly in this way. Combat operations are a difficult thing. So, it is hard – and makes no sense – to think far too ahead. But it happens precisely in this way. And we are advancing, as we said, towards achieving the priority goals that we outlined at the start of the special military operation.' Putin receiving the banner of the 155th Marine Brigade of the Pacific Fleet. (Kremlin) While Putin has previously stated that the Kursk region would be fully liberated following Ukraine's August invasion, he declined to say exactly when that will happen. 'I cannot and do not want to provide a specific date as to when they will be driven out,' he explained. 'Our troops are engaged in combat right now, and the battles are intense. As I have mentioned before, there was no strategic military reason for the Ukrainian armed forces to enter the Kursk Region or to hold their position there as they are, deploying their elite assault groups and units to no avail. Yet, this situation persists. We will undoubtedly drive them out.' He added that he is ready to meet with Trump. 'You asked what we can offer, or what I can offer to the newly elected President Trump when we meet,' Putin said in response to a question from NBC’s Keir Simmons. 'First of all, I don’t know when we will meet. Because he hasn’t said anything about it. I haven’t spoken to him at all in over four years. Of course, I am ready for this at any time, and I will be ready for a meeting if he wants it.' Asked what he would do differently about launching the war, Putin said: 'Knowing what's happening now, back in 2022 I would've thought the decision ought to have been taken earlier. We ought to have started getting ready for those developments, and the special military operation, before.' I should have invaded Ukraine earlier, Putin tells Russians in TV marathon Mike Walker (@New_Narrative) December 19, 2024 He also threatened to hit Kyiv with the new Oreshnik Intermediate-Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM) as a way to test the Western-provided air defense systems. 'There are several types of air defense systems&#8230;such as Patriot and the more modern [Terminal High Altitude Area Defense] THAAD systems,' Putin said, the latter of which has not been sent to Ukraine. 'I do not know if Ukraine has them, but I do not think so. If the Americans want, they can send its THAAD systems to Ukraine. These are more modern systems similar to our S-400 systems. The Patriot systems are comparable to our S-300s, while THAAD is similar to our S-400 systems, if only slightly inferior. Let them send these systems to Ukraine, and we will ask our people in Ukraine to tell us about the modern solutions of these systems which we could use.' That comparative of missile systems is wildly inaccurate by any standards. As for the name of the missile, Putin smirked, claiming he did not know its origin. 'Honestly, no idea,' he said. 'No clue.' Last month, Russia struck the city of Dnipro with the Oreshnik, most likely a conventionally armed IRBM based on the RS-26 Rubezh. You can read more about the history of this weapon in our deep dive here. Putin said the West and Russia should conduct a &#034;high-technology duel&#034; to verify the efficency of Russia's Oreshnik IRBM.&#034;Pick a target for strike, let's say, in Kyiv. Bring all your air and missile defense forces there, and we will strike this site with Oreshnik. Then, we'll see what happens.&#034;&mdash; Status-6 (Military & Conflict News) (@archer83able.bsky.social) 2024-12-19T11:15:53.815Z That comment did not sit well with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. He called Putin 'a scumbag' over the proposed missile technology duel. ''Putin said about a 'technological duel'.

The barrier, as we previously reported, was made up of nearly three dozen barges sunk just south of the twice-attacked bridge. The extent of the storm damage, however, is unclear. There were 34 barges there as of Oct. 1. Naval expert HI Sutton posted on Twitter Thursday that of those, only 11 remain. He suggested that the other 23 possibly sank in the storm. However, on Dec. 10, the Kyiv Independent noted that there were far fewer barges there before Sunday's storm. 'Recent Sentinel-2 satellite images from Dec. 8 reveal only 18 barges remaining between Tuzla Island and the Kerch Peninsula,' the publication reported. 'The fate of the other 16 vessels is unclear.' The barriers were designed to stop Ukrainian uncrewed surface vessels (USV) from striking the bridge. It was severely damaged in July 2023 by a Ukrainian Sea Baby drone boat attack and before that by a truck bomb in October 2022. While the status of the bridge barrier is uncertain, the oil leaking out of the ships sunk in the storm created a huge environmental disaster. ***UPDATE***Remains of #Russian tankers and damage to defences at Kerch Bridge, December 18, 2024 #OSINT pic.twitter.com/kHXPt4Y0UF&mdash; H I Sutton (@CovertShores) December 18, 2024 It looks like more North Korean 170mm M1989 Koksan self-propelled artillery units are heading to the front lines.

Spanish Typhoon Buy Signals Upward Trend For Eurofighter	Spain is buying another 25 Eurofighter Typhoons, to replace some of its oldest EF-18 Hornet fighters, as part of a continuing modernization program for the Spanish Air and Space Force. The announcement of the deal comes amid something of an upturn in fortunes for the pan-European multirole fighter, which is also receiving new radars and weapons. An artist’s impression of a Spanish Typhoon from the latest Halcón II program. Airbus Juanjo Sanz Known as the Halcón II (Hawk II) program, the latest Spanish contract, which covers 21 single-seat and four twin-seat Typhoons, was announced today. The agreement was signed between the Spanish government and the NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency (NETMA), based in Germany. Deliveries are due to start in 2030. The Spanish government has ordered 25 additional #Eurofighter!

These jets will start to be delivered in 2026.

Initially, Spain signed up for 73 Typhoons, although three have been lost through attrition, leaving a current fleet of 70 aircraft from Tranche 1, 2, and 3A production. Like the earlier jets, the Halcón I and II Typhoons will be built locally at the Airbus plant in Getafe, near Madrid. Typhoons delivered under Halcón I and II will be considerably more capable than the Tranche 1, 2, and 3A aircraft already in service. An infographic showing key elements of the Halcón II program, a deal for which was signed today. Airbus The new Tranche 4 standard features advanced avionics, including an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar. For the Spanish aircraft, this radar is the Captor-E Mk 1, which you can read more about here. A model of the ECRS Mk 1 radar from Hensoldt. Photo by Marijan Murat/picture alliance via Getty Images Tranche 4 also has enhanced weapon systems allowing it to use the Brimstone 3 precision air-to-ground munition and full capability with the Meteor beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile. Today, the Spanish Air and Space Force — or Ejército del Aire y del Espacio — fields Typhoons at the air bases of Morón (11th Wing), near Seville, and Los Llanos (14th Wing), in Albacete. An official video showing Typhoons from Morón (11th Wing) and Los Llanos (14th Wing): Next, the service will introduce Typhoons at Gando (46th Wing), in the Canary Islands, as it starts the process of replacing its oldest EF-18 ‘legacy’ Hornets. The Canary Islands are a Spanish archipelago located in the Atlantic Ocean, west of Morocco. These oldest Hornets were previously operated by the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps as F/A-18As. A total of 24 were sourced from U.S. stocks between 1995 and 2000 and were modernized to the F/A-18A+ standard, making them broadly comparable with the U.S. Navy’s F/A-18C/D. However, the airframes are now old and, although they have a multirole capability, they have always been primarily used for air defense. While the Halcón I Typhoons will succeed the old EF-18s in the Canary Islands, Halcón II will kickstart the replacement of the remaining Spanish Hornets. Spanish Typhoons prepare to depart Los Llanos, Albacete, on November 28, 2024, for Romania, where they will remain deployed until March. The fighters were already in April this year performing defense and deterrence tasks on the eastern flank of the Atlantic alliance. Photo By Victor Fernandez/Europa Press via Getty Images Europa Press News These were delivered new, from the aircraft’s original manufacturer, McDonnell Douglas, between 1986 and 1992. A total of 72 were received, but the fleet has since been reduced to 52 single-seaters and 12 two-seaters. Spain’s new-build Hornets were put through an upgrade program in the mid-1990s, which brought them up to a standard that was broadly similar to the F/A-18C/D. The resulting aircraft, which became known as EF-18A+/B+s, featured new mission computers, targeting pods, and AIM-120 AMRAAM capability. A continued process of enhancements under a mid-life upgrade effort has since helped the Hornets keep pace with their rivals, adding the Thales Scorpion helmet-mounted display and a ROVER air-to-ground video datalink for the targeting pod, among others. In the process, the jets received the revised designations EF-18AM/BM. One of the former U.S.-operated F/A-18A+ jets on a mission over the Canary Islands. Giovanni Colla/Ejército del Aire Ministerio de Defensa España While not as worn-out as the ex-U.S. EF-18s serving in the Canary Islands, these aircraft are also now showing their age. It’s notable, meanwhile, that the equivalent F/A-18C/D has now been retired from frontline U.S. Navy service. Back in 2020, The War Zone suggested that Spain might well buy more Typhoons (today’s Halcón II announcement), but a question remains about its plans for the rest of the EF-18 fleet, which will also require replacement before too long. As an alternative to more Typhoons, Spain might choose to risk waiting on the new pan-European combat jet being developed under the Future Combat Air System (FCAS), which also involves France, Germany, and Belgium. The FCAS initiative plans to field a sixth-generation stealthy crewed fighter and accompanying uncrewed platforms, weapons, and sensors by 2040. An artist’s impression of the Next Generation Fighter (NGF) that will be at the core of the pan-European FCAS program. Dassault Aviation Dassault Aviation Whether the FCAS program meets this timeline is questionable, however, and this might lead to more Spanish orders for Typhoons. Having bought batches of 20 and 25 Tranche 4 Typhoons, another batch of 20-25 aircraft might be an option, depending on FCAS progress. At the same time, there is a Spanish Navy requirement to replace its EAV-8B+ Matador II short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) jets — equivalent to the U.S. Marine Corps AV-8B+ Harrier II — which operate from the deck of the amphibious assault ship Juan Carlos I. Here, the only crewed fighter option is the F-35B Joint Strike Fighter.

Photo by Jon Hobley/MI News/NurPhoto via Getty Images MI News With a force of only 13 Matador IIs to replace from around 2030 to 2034, buying F-35Bs for just this requirement will likely prove cost-prohibitive. However, there may be an argument to buy a larger force of F-35Bs to operate from the Juan Carlos I and from land bases, paralleling the arrangement adopted by the United Kingdom. Whatever happens with replacing the Matador II and the remaining EF-18s, today’s announcement only reinforces Spain’s commitment to the Typhoon. In contrast to other operators, most of which are planning to withdraw their oldest Tranche 1 Typhoons, Spain decided to upgrade its 17 surviving Tranche 1 jets. Airbus has incorporated later Tranche 2 and Tranche 3 equipment in these aircraft, to provide a full multirole capability. Re-deliveries of the modernized Typhoons began in 2019. Outside of Spain, Eurofighter has secured follow-on orders from other core customers. Germany is buying 38 Tranche 4 aircraft and another 20 Tranche 4+/5 jets, 15 of which will be configured for electronic warfare missions. Italy is also adding to its fleet, with an order for 24 Tranche 4 aircraft.

Photo by JOHN MACDOUGALL/AFP via Getty Images JOHN MACDOUGALL In terms of capabilities, the Typhoon is also advancing. The Captor-E Mk 2 radar, also known as ECRS Mk 2 radar, has now been fitted in a British Typhoon. This is an even more advanced radar than the ECRS Mk 1 that Spain will receive and includes a unique ‘swashplate’ positioning mechanism to further boost its capabilities. A recent photo published by the Hensoldt company in Germany — part of the ECRS consortium — indicates that inflight tests of the ECRS Mk 1 are also due to start soon. In this case, rather than mounting the radar in a Typhoon, it has been installed in an Airbus A320 flying testbed, within a radome grafted onto the front of the airliner. A German Aerospace Center (DLR) A320 testbed fitted with a radome housing the ECRS Mk 1 radar. Hensoldt In other Typhoon news from today, Germany has decided to complete the work to integrate the Taurus KEPD 350 cruise missile on the aircraft. Germany originally acquired this weapon to arm its Tornado IDS swing-wing strike aircraft and, although trials have been carried out with the Typhoon, it was not fully integrated. Now, the Taurus KEPD 350 will be introduced on operational German Typhoons, as part of the P4E upgrade package. That should see the German Air Force deploying the cruise missile on its Typhoons from 2028 or 2029. As a Taurus KEPD 350 operator, Spain might also choose to integrate the missile on its Typhoons, too.

Now, however, the partner nations’ commitment to the Typhoon — both in terms of upgrades to existing aircraft and additional orders for new Tranches — is providing Eurofighter with a major boost. Demonstrations of support from the core customers could well also help drive export interest.

Marine-Moving Medium Landing Ship Critical To China Fight Put On ...	The U.S. Navy’s Medium Landing Ship (LSM), a platform many view as crucial to transporting Marines among remote islands in a future war against China, is dead in the water for the time being. Reports emerged this week that sea service leaders balked at high cost estimates that have come in from industry to build the vessel. The pause raises questions about how the U.S. Marine Corps will enact its West Pacific, island-hopping concepts of operations, known as Expeditionary Advance Base Operations (EABO), and is the latest delay to afflict the program. Formerly known as the Light Amphibious Warship (LAW) and also referred to as the Landing Ship Medium, the vessel is envisioned as delivering forces right onto a beach without any established port facilities. It would ferry mobile, platoon-size Marine units to islands where they would fire anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCM) at Chinese forces and collect data for the other U.S. forces, among other tasks. Those Marines would also work to deter opponents in situations short of actual conflict, while helping to control littoral areas and seascapes. Such missions would be conducted by the new Marine Littoral Regiments (MLR). They would occur within China’s striking distance, likely in the southern Japanese islands and in the Philippines, part of a sea-denial campaign spanning the South China Sea and East China Sea, analysts say. Navy and Marine Corps leaders have called for between 18 to 35 LSMs that would range in length from 200 to 400 feet, with a 12-foot draft, each crewed by about 70 sailors, according to an August Congressional Research Service (CRS) report. The LSM would provide 8,000 square feet of deck cargo space, carrying 50 Marines and nearly 650 tons of equipment. A rendering of the future U.S. Navy Medium Landing Ship (LSM) and its capabilities. (U.S. Navy) LSM would also feature a helicopter landing pad, two 30mm guns and six .50-caliber machine guns for self defense. They would have a 14-knot transit speed, a cruising range of 3,500 nautical miles, and would be expected to serve for 20 years. But as the Marine Corps continues to urgently relay their need for the LSM, the Navy canceled a request for proposals to build the LSM after bids from industry came in too high, according to the sea service and media reports. Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) officials declined to tell TWZ the cost estimate that led the service to cancel its solicitation for the LSM on Dec. 6, saying it was unable to provide 'source selection sensitive information.' The LSM program is now working to revise its acquisition strategy to 'address affordability concerns,' the command said. 'A Request for Information (RFI) is likely to be released to industry very early in 2025 to identify non-developmental options,' NAVSEA added. USNI News’ Mallory Shelbourne first reported the latest LSM setback this week, citing comments by Navy leadership. 'We put it out for bid and it came back with a much higher price tag,' USNI News quoted Assistant Secretary of the Navy for research, development and acquisition Nickolas Guertin as saying at an American Society of Naval Engineers symposium last week. 'We simply weren’t able to pull it off. So we had to pull that solicitation back and drop back and punt.' Guertin noted that the service had what they thought was a 'bulletproof' cost estimate, and a 'pretty well wrung out design in terms of requirements, independent cost estimates,' USNI News reported. The Navy’s proposed Fiscal Year 2025 budget requests shows the first LSM would cost $268 million, but costs would average out to roughly $156 million by the seventh and eighth ship, according to the Congressional Research Service (CRS). A U.S. defense official speaking on condition of anonymity told TWZ Thursday that initial plans called for each ship to cost between $100 million and $150 million, but that the Navy added features to meet their requirements, and that shot the price of each ship up dramatically. The Marines wanted a ship that was less exquisite and more numerous, according to the official. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) said in April that Navy estimates for the LSM’s cost have 'varied widely.' CBO’s own analysis found the LSM could cost $340 million to $430 million per ship for an 18-ship program, an estimate it said reflects the range of full-load displacements – 4,500 tons to 5,400 tons – in preliminary designs that shipbuilders submitted to the Navy. Marine Corps representatives told TWZ Thursday that the service is currently working on 'a way ahead' for the LSM program in conjunction with the Navy, and is exploring other options that will allow the MLRs to continue advancing the EABO concept. LSMs are seen as a key mover of Marines under EABO, which is a major component of the Marine Corps overhaul known as Force Design 2030 that seeks to ready the service for a war with China. Part of that original vision saw the Navy and Marines moving away from a laser focus on large amphibious assault and landing ships. A more nimble, numerous and cost-effective fleet of small ships tailored to distributed warfare in the Pacific would offset some of the reduced large amphibious warship force. That so far has not happened, and the 'Gator Navy' fleet focused on massive beach landings, which many say are unrealistic in modern warfare, remains intact. A rendering of a potential medium landing ship by the shipmaker Austal. (Austal) TWZ has extensively reported on EABO and what it means for the Corps:. 'At its core, EABO involves relatively small groups of Marines quickly establishing bases of operation in forward areas, especially on small islands. This concept of distributed operations also envisions them being able to then rapidly reposition themselves, as necessary. The purpose is to use these flexible, responsive ground forces to help control littoral areas, and even surrounding 'seaspaces,' to deter opponents in situations short of an actual conflict, and then, if that fails, be well-positioned to engage enemy forces.' In a statement to TWZ Thursday, the Marine Corps reiterated that the LSM is a critical component of the island-hopping mission it expects the MLRs to one day embark upon under the EABO concept. 'The medium landing ship (LSM) is intended to provide surface maneuver direct support to Stand-in Forces (SIF) and the Marine Regiments executing missions on behalf of the naval campaign,' the service said. 'Put plainly, to move a Marine regiment around the Pacific or elsewhere, it would take many C-17s … to move the personnel and equipment that a medium landing ship can move. And that’s without the geographic flexibility of a beachable surface craft.' A Marine sets up defenses during an Expeditionary Advance Base Operation (EABO) exercise in 2020. (U.S. Marine Corps) The Marine Corps also told TWZ that it is working on 'an acquisition way ahead' for the LSM, and that the 'complex requirements' of the ship 'challenge government and industry to design and produce affordable materiel solutions.' For now, the Marines are making do and are leaning on existing commercial and military capabilities that require little modification, according to the service. Those efforts have included Marines using stern-landing ships to inform the development of the LSM in the interim. A June 2024 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report warned that 'existing commercial designs require significant modifications to meet LSM’s requirements,' and that none of the commercial designs assessed by the Navy had the required beachability or cargo fuel capacity. 'Although not optimal, such vessels will provide both operational capability and a sound basis for live experimentation and refining detailed requirements for the LSM program,' the Corps said in a 2022 update to Force Design 2030. The Marines first introduced the idea of the LSM in 2020, but the program has suffered several stalls, with plans to acquire the first vessels initially pushed back to Fiscal Year 2023 and then to Fiscal 2025, as the Navy grapples with hefty bills for submarines and other needs, Defense News reported in 2022. The Navy began receiving LSM concepts from shipyards and design firms in late 2020. By January 2024, the Navy was seeking proposals for the LSM, with Marine Corps officials saying they were on pace to procure in 2025 and deliver in 2029, according to the CRS. Opinions continue to differ on what the LSM should be, with the Navy wanting a survivable vessel and the Marines looking to field the capability as quickly as possible, as some warn that China could invade Taiwan and prompt a U.S. response in the next few years. Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Eric Smith downplayed concerns about the LSM’s survivability in 2023, according to a report by Defense Daily’s Rich Abbott. 'Well, if I take that to the next step, soldiers and Marines, y’all can’t leave the barracks because the enemy’s got machine guns,' Smith was quoted as saying. 'Hey, pilots, you got to stay on the tarmac because there’s anti-air missiles out there. Hey, submariners and ship drivers, y’all can’t leave the pier because there’s [anti-ship cruise missiles] and torpedoes. That doesn’t make sense.' The Commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. Eric M. Smith, right, and the Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. Lisa M. Franchetti. (U.S. Marine Corps) TWZ has reported on leaders playing down the differences between the services on where LSM should head. Despite 'healthy friction' over the LSM, 'there is no daylight between us' on the need for those ships, Navy Vice Adm. Scott Conn, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Warfighting Requirements and Capabilities, said at a conference in April 2023. The latest LSM travails again highlight a longstanding tension between the Navy and Marine Corps. The Marines need certain maritime capabilities for amphibious operations. The Navy is tasked with moving those Marines, but must pay for the ships the Marines need. Similar debates have surfaced around the size of the larger-deck amphibious fleet in recent years as well. The amphibious force is 'not the favorite thing of the Navy to deal with,' according to Bradley Martin, a retired Navy surface warfare officer who spent two-thirds of his 30-year career at sea. 'I say this as a guy who spent a number of years on the amphibs,' said Martin, now a senior policy researcher with the RAND think tank. 'The Marines aren’t very worried about how the Navy sustains ships, and the Navy hasn’t been really clear about what it takes to sustain ships. There’s been that disconnect.' Mark Cancian, a retired Marine Corps colonel and senior advisor with the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank’s defense and security department, told TWZ Thursday that the LSM conundrum is different because, unlike past amphibious disagreements, the Marines want a low-end ship and the Navy is arguing for a high-end capability. Cancian worked in the Pentagon in the 1990s and recalled a proposal for the equivalent to a LHA or LHD amphib built to civilian standards that could be used for peacetime presence missions. It would be cheaper but unsuitable for wartime needs. 'The Marine Corps fought against it tooth and nail,' he recalled. 'I remember Marines being in my office, saying it would be immoral to put Marines on a ship built to civilian standards.' The amphibious assault ship USS Wasp (LHD-1), a traditional big-deck Marine mover. (U.S. Navy) 'There’s going to be some tough negotiations between the Navy and Marine Corps,' Cancian added. 'And the new administration will weigh in too, on force design, on the topline and shipbuilding. But the Marine Corps won’t give up.' In general, the LSM’s concept has not matched its execution, Martin said. 'They need something, and this just isn’t the right capability,' he said. 'It’s too expensive. When you get right down to it, you’ve got to move stuff around, even if you beach, you’re still going to be vulnerable during the period that you’re beached.' The Pentagon should instead be investing in civilian-manned ferries for such missions that would be part of the existing strategic sealift fleet, Martin said. China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) is already at work on such a civilian-military meld. It has been modifying roll-on, roll-off (RO/RO) ferries with stern ramps that will allow the force to launch and recover amphibious combat vehicles in the event of a cross-strait invasion of Taiwan, Maritime Executive reported in 2023. Such a move would give the PLAN a big boost when it comes to the amount of amphibious lift it could summon for such a landing, allowing Beijing to close its amphibious gap without building more military amphibs. The Pentagon’s annual report on China’s military capabilities released this week notes that 'amphibious marine forces continued to conduct routine driver integration training with PLAN amphibious and civilian roll-on/roll-off (RO/RO) vessels.' 'Amphibious marine forces continued to conduct routine driver integration training with PLAN amphibious ships and civilian roll-on/roll-off (RO/RO) vessels,' the report states. 'Non-amphibious marine forces continued civilian-military integration training, with a new PLANMC BDE in the northern theater observed loading vehicles onto a RO/RO and conducting a sea crossing before unloading from the RO/RO.' China has also used civilian ferries to move its amphibious forces and launch amphibious craft during beach invasion drills. Turning commercial ships into helicopter carriers is also something China's is training to do during a major contingency operation.

LSMs won’t be used to storm a beach, or for opposed landings, Martin said. But the requirements include a military crew, damage control and other features that don’t reflect its core mission, which drives up the price. 'Anywhere that ship might go is subject to targeting, but having the type of weapons it’s got on it won’t do much good against the type of threat the Chinese or any capable power are likely to throw against it,' he said. 'It’s not a well-conceived answer.' Real talk about what capability the Navy could provide for the Marines to carry out EABO might have occurred at lower levels, but likely got diluted further up the chain, he said. 'It got further and further away from a discussion about requirements, toward just a head nod that we’re going to do it,' Martin said. 'That is a problem with the Navy’s management of requirements in general. All the services are guilty of this to a degree, but the people generating requirements are not talking to other people generating requirements, and they’re not engaged with the people actually designing equipment, and that’s a big problem.' Even as the Marines proceed with Force Design 2030 and EABO, CRS’s August 2024 LSM report notes that debate about the merits of the two plans continue. Questions remain about whether the concepts focus too heavily on China war scenarios at the expense of other Marine Corps missions. It also remains unclear whether the MLRs would be able to get access to the islands they need to operate from, in addition to resupply and survivability concerns. There’s also the question of whether the MLRs could contribute meaningfully to sea-denial operations, although the Marines emphasize that the MLR platoons would be collecting vital data as well. American military brass portrays the threat of war with China as one that is just over the horizon. If that is in fact the case, the latest delay in the LSM hinders the Marines’ ability to contribute to that fight in the not-so-distant future, given their plans for how their portion of that fight would play out. Above all else, it highlights a disconnect between urgent messaging on the threat and what's needed to address it, and the actual procurement of those solutions.

Syria’s Air Defenses Helped Make The F-22A Raptor A Reality	In the face of post-Cold War drawdowns, the U.S. Air Force pushed ahead with buying the famously expensive F-22 Raptor stealth fighter in part because of a perhaps unexpected reason: concerns about Syrian air defenses. Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall talked about the Syrian connection to the F-22's story during an online talk that the Air & Space Forces Association's Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies hosted earlier today. Kendall is an Army veteran and career civil servant who has held various positions within the Department of Defense and the Air Force since the 1980s, including ones in which he was directly involved in crafting requirements for what became the F-22. The Air Force selected Lockheed's YF-22 as the winner of its Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) competition, beating out Northrop's YF-23, in 1991 just as the Soviet Union was collapsing. The U.S. military spending notably contracted following the end of the Cold War, with various high-profile programs ending up canceled or severely truncated as a result. Questions were raised about the multi-billion-dollar F-22 acquisition program. Northrop's YF-23, at top, flies alongside Lockheed's YF-22. USAF 'The scenario that we used &#8230; on a requirements basis to convince ourselves, [and] Secretary [of Defense Dick] Cheney, that we should continue with the F-22 was Syria,' Kendall said today. 'Right after the Cold War, &#8230; they had [one of] the most modern &#8230; integrated air defenses at the time.' During the 1970s and 1980s, the Syrian military did amass a significant array of Soviet short, medium, and long-range surface-to-air missile systems. This included fixed site types like the SA-2 Guideline and SA-5 Gammon, self-propelled designs like the SA-6 Gainful and the SA-11 Gadfly, and multiple variants of the Strela family of man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS). Part of an Iranian SA-5 surface-to-air missile system seen in 2009. Ali Shayegan/AFP via Getty Images A Russian SA-11 self-propelled surface-to-air missile system. YURI KADOBNOV/AFP via Getty Images YURI KADOBNOV In the end, the F-22 program was still significantly scaled back ostensibly over its high cost and the Air Force only received 187 examples in the end, a decision widely viewed today as near-sighted. It's certainly interesting to consider that Syrian air defenses were once significant enough to drive the development of something like the F-22, which remains the most capable fighter in U.S. inventory today. Syria was actually the first locale where the Raptor was employed in combat, with the stealthy jets striking ISIS terrorists in the country in 2014. F-22s were utilized in part because of their survivability against potential threats from the regime in Damascus. F-22s continued to operate over the country for years afterward to help shield U.S. forces and their local partners from Syrian forces, as well as their Iranian and Russian allies. Kendall's comments about the Syrian scenario and the F-22 came in response to a question about future stand-in strike capabilities. 'It depends upon who you're standing against&#8230; Clearly, we need some of that capability [against] critical targets. It can be accomplished in different ways. You can do it with stand-off weapons, up to a point, but there's a cost associated with that,' Kendall explained, after which he shared the F-22/Syria anecdote. 'Our pacing challenge today is not Syria. It's much tougher,' he continued. 'You gotta take a harder look at what's the right mix and what do you want to do with it. The other thing that's true is that Syria was not a nuclear power. Russia and China are nuclear powers with a lot of nuclear weapons. So what you would do in a conventional conflict with them has to be done with an eye to what are the consequences in the strategic [realm].' The Air Force is currently in the process of acquiring a new dedicated Stand-in Attack Weapon (SiAW) missile to 'provide [a] capability to strike rapidly re-locatable targets that create the Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) environment,' according to the service's 2025 Fiscal Year budget request. Those 'targets include Theater Ballistic Missile Launchers, Land Attack and Anti-Ship Cruise Missile Launchers, Jammers, Anti-Satellite Systems, and Integrated Air Defense Systems.' A US Air Force F-16C Viper fighter releases a SiAW test missile. USAF Northrop Grumman is leading the development of the SiAW, which is a derivative of the company's AGM-88G Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile-Extended Range (AARGM-ER) missile. AARGM-ER, a program the U.S. Navy is leading, is intended primarily to punch holes in enemy air defenses, though it will also have a more general secondary strike capability. The stealthy F-35A Joint Strike Fighter is expected to be the first platform armed with the SiAW, which could find its way onto other aircraft and that you can read more about here. Kendall's comments today about capabilities mixes and cost considerations also come as the service's plans for a new sixth-generation stealth combat jet as part of its larger Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) modernization initiative are very much in question. A final decision on how to proceed with that program has now been pushed into next year when President-elect Donald Trump takes office. The fate of other Air Force advanced aviation efforts, including its Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drone program and plans to acquire stealthy aerial refueling tankers, are also intertwined with the NGAD combat jet decision. The current 'pacing challenge,' or 'China, China, China' as Kendall has liked to say during his tenure as Air Force Secretary, will be a key factor in any decision-making about Air Force modernization plans just like Syria apparently was for the F-22.

Iranian F-14 Tomcat Encounter At An Airshow Unlike Any Other	As the world’s only operator of the legendary F-14 Tomcat swing-wing fighter, the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force (IRIAF) has a unique airpower status. A recent airshow provided the chance for a very rare close-quarters look at the Cold War-era jet, which by now has very questionable capabilities and serviceability, while there are persistent reports that it could soon be replaced entirely by Russian-provided Su-35 Flanker multirole fighters. Živojin Banković, a military aviation writer for the Serbian Tango Six website, shared with The War Zone photos that he took while on assignment in Iran, where he saw one of the country’s last F-14s, as well as other unusual aircraft types, at the 2024 Kish Air Show. Star of the show: the participating F-14A serial number 3-6006 from the 8th Tactical Air Base at Isfahan. @tower_eye, Tango Six In fact, the 12th Iran International Aerospace Exhibition on Kish Island in the Persian Gulf, held from December 10-13, offered what might be the public’s final opportunity to witness the ‘Persian Cats’ in action. Even getting to the event was something of a challenge, especially given the tensions and complex geopolitical situation in the Middle East right now. For Banković, conditions were eased somewhat since his native Serbia is one of just five European nations whose citizens can enter Iran without visas, with Tehran allowing tourist stays of up to 15 days. @tower_eye, Tango Six The 2024 Kish Air Show presented some challenges for the organizers, too. On December 5, in the run-up to the show, an Iranian-made Yasin jet trainer crashed while flying to the event, killing its two pilots, Colonels Hamidreza Ranjbar and Manuchehr Pirzadeh. The highly experienced test pilots had been expected to demonstrate the Yasin and U.S.-made F-5 fighters at the show. While the cause of the crash has not been disclosed, there are unconfirmed reports that the aircraft may have suffered a double engine failure. The F-14 dominates the IRIAF static display at Kish Island. @tower_eye, Tango Six Understandably, the incident tempered the atmosphere at the airshow, resulting in a somewhat somber 12th edition. Initially, the organizers told Banković and his colleagues that there would be no military aircraft present at the airshow. Poised to cancel the trip to Iran entirely, another email arrived just a couple of days before the show was to begin — the IRIAF would participate after all. Still, on arrival, there would be more problems for Banković, as he explained to The War Zone: 'The first day presented challenges for spotters who had purchased spotter tickets costing hundreds of dollars. Poor organization and coordination between the event staff, police, and military security prevented access to the designated airport areas — as had been promised. As an apology, the organizers offered a morning tourist tour of Kish Island on the final day.' Despite these setbacks, journalists and enthusiasts subsequently enjoyed unprecedented access to the F-14 and its crew, relishing the chance to see the operational Tomcat on the ground and in the air — something impossible in the Western world since the U.S. Navy retired the fighter back in 2006. The F-14 might still be the pride of the IRIAF, but the fleet has suffered high-profile issues throughout its eventful service in Iran. The nose of the IRIAF F-14 contains an AN/AWG-9 fire control radar. @tower_eye, Tango Six In particular, the F-14’s once-state-of-the-art AN/AWG-9 fire control radar has suffered from low serviceability, with the Tomcat fleet effectively being divided between those with fully functioning radars and those with more diminished capabilities. The current status of any surviving AIM-54 Phoenix and AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missiles is also a matter of debate and Iranian programs to introduce alternative weaponry for the F-14 have had only very mixed results, as you can read more about here. The fact that only one F-14 was included in the airshow is almost certainly indicative of broader problems within the IRIAF. As well as long-term maintenance issues with the Tomcats especially, the air force as a whole is facing the prospect of a potential broader conflict in the region, so serviceable combat jets would have been required for quick reaction alert and other high-priority tasks. As it was, the IRIAF participated at Kish with a fleet of just 10 aircraft. The static display featured six aircraft (three F-5s and three PC-7 turboprop trainers), while four others participated in the aerial display (one F-14 and three F-4 Phantoms). This fell short of the originally announced lineup, which was supposed to include demonstrations of the Yasin, F-5, MiG-29 Fulcrum, and Yak-130 Mitten, along with additional aircraft in the static display. A Saghe — an Iranian twin-tail modification of the F-5E. @tower_eye, Tango Six The modest IRIAF participation was not only attributable to the Yasin accident. After all, most of the fleet comprises aircraft that are between 30 and 50 years old — if not older. Despite Iran’s ability to adapt to sanctions, maintaining such aging equipment is getting increasingly difficult. This was evident at the airshow itself — the F-14 flew only on the pre-show arrival day, performing a low pass, a turn, landing, and taxiing before remaining grounded for the remainder of the show, departing only on December 14. A planned race between an F-14 and a Lamborghini was canceled due to technical issues with the Tomcat. Instead, the Lamborghini was raced against a civilian aircraft, a Hawker Beechcraft 400XP from the local Toos airline. The participating F-14A (U.S. Navy Bureau Number 160334, Iranian serial number 3-6006) came from the 8th Tactical Air Base at Isfahan, which is home to Iran’s last three Tomcat squadrons: the 81st, 82nd, and 83rd Tactical Combat Squadrons. In contrast, the F-4 fighter, increasingly also a global rarity, fared better at Kish. Three F-4Es from the 91st Tactical Combat Squadron performed impressive formation flybys and solo passes over three days, operating out of their home base, the 9th Tactical Air Base at Bandar Abbas. F-4E Phantom fighter-bombers are currently the backbone of the IRIAF. @tower_eye, Tango Six As it stands, there is a strong likelihood that the F-4 will outlive the F-14 in Iranian service, in an ironic twist. After all, the F-14 was originally introduced as a Phantom replacement for the U.S. Navy’s carrier air wings. Back in 2023, an Iranian lawmaker told media in that country that Russia would deliver the first Su-35 fighters to the IRIAF 'in the coming months.' Shahriar Heidari, a member of the Iranian parliament’s National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, told the semi-official Tasnim news agency in January 2023 that the first examples of the Russian-made fighter were planned to be handed over to the IRIAF in the spring of 2023. While that never happened, there have since been more reports indicating that the delivery of Flankers to Iran could be imminent. It’s widely presumed that the aircraft in question would be drawn from a batch that was already built for Egypt, before the deal with Cairo collapsed, apparently under U.S. pressure. One of the Su-35s built for Egypt but never transferred to that country. via @nskplanes It’s unclear how many Su-35s Iran might be looking to acquire, but reports suggest that the IRIAF could be in line to receive 24 examples. Such a deal makes good sense for Tehran and Moscow. For three decades, Iran’s attempts to procure new Chinese- or Russian-made fighters to replace its aging fleets of F-4s, F-5s, and F-14s have failed, in the face of international sanctions. But Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has led to it being ostracized, too, and increasingly seeking military and economic relations with Iran. This burgeoning relationship has seen, most notably, Shahed series one-way attack drones heading from Iran to Russia, as well as being built locally in Russian factories. With Moscow finding it increasingly hard to sell arms, Iran is now very much one of the most realistic clients. Yet another Iranian F-5 upgrade, the Kowsar, in front of the F-14. @tower_eye, Tango Six While a true multirole fighter, and a generational leap above the F-14A, the Flanker-E is similarly a twin-engine fighter, equipped with a powerful fire-control radar, and has the potential to carry very long-range air-to-air missiles. It would therefore be an obvious replacement for the IRIAF’s Tomcats. In the past, Tasnim reported that at least some of the Su-35s are expected to be based at the 8th Tactical Air Base at Isfahan, where they would almost certainly supplement and eventually replace the F-14s of the 81st, 82nd, and 83rd Tactical Combat Squadrons. For now, however, there’s no sign of imminent Su-35 deliveries to Iran, meaning that diminishing numbers of F-14s will likely have to continue in service for some time longer.
