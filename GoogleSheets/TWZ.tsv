Japan Expands Carrier Capabilities With F-35B, Drones Could Be Ne...	A U.S. Marine Corps F-35B stealth fighter has for the first time operated aboard Japan’s biggest in-service warship, the Izumo class ‘multifunctional destroyer’ Kaga. We have previously reported on the significant modifications made to this amphibious assault ship to ensure it can operate the short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) jets, which Japan is also acquiring. At the same time, there are signs that Japan may also be looking to expand the fixed-wing capabilities of this class of vessel, including drones and potentially other crewed platforms. A Marine Corps F-35B flown by a test pilot from Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Two Three (VX-23) landed aboard Kaga for the first time on October 20, off the southern coast of California. The vessel is currently embarking an integrated test team as part of the developmental test effort to certify the modified vessel for operating F-35Bs. Lt. Cdr.

The Phalanx 20mm close-in weapon system (CIWS) previously mounted on the front of the warship was also removed. Subsequently, further modifications involved re-balancing and structurally reinforcing Kaga’s hull. Kaga shortly before pulling away from its dock in Kure City, Hiroshima Prefecture, in April 2023. @betafujihara via X Kaga was originally launched in 2015 and commissioned in 2017. Japan has previously tested the U.S. Marine Corps F-35B from the deck of a modified Izumo class warship, when the name ship of the class undertook trials in October 2021, as you can read about here. This was the time that Japan had operated fixed-wing aircraft from ships since the end of World War II. A video showing those trials is embedded below. Izumo was commissioned in 2015 and completed its first phase of modifications in 2021. However, the second phase of modifications, including the Kaga-style squared-off flight deck, are not scheduled to begin until March next year. Tokyo took the decision to modify its two Izumo class vessels for STOVL operations back in 2018, although there had previously been rumors that a return to fixed-wing carrier aviation was always likely, despite official statements to the contrary. While officially described as ‘multifunctional destroyers,’ the Izumo class warships were primarily helicopter carriers, prior to the STOVL modifications.

Photo by Andrew Lotulung/NurPhoto via Getty Images Once modified, the two warships will be able to embark Japan’s F-35Bs. 42 are on order and they will be operated by the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF), which also has a growing fleet of conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) F-35A versions. As the tests with U.S. Marine Corps F-35Bs suggest, the modifications to the vessels also pave the way to interoperability with American F-35Bs. While this would help maximize the utility of these vessels, especially bearing in mind the JASDF’s relatively small F-35B fleet, there remain questions about the feasibility of longer-term Marine Corps deployments aboard Japan’s carriers. This is something that also applies to the United Kingdom, which has raised the possibility of embarking Marine Corps F-35Bs more regularly to help boost its carrier strike potential. HMS Queen Elizabeth embarking F-35Bs from British and American squadrons during maneuvers in 2020. Crown Copyright Still, even if embarked on a more ad-hoc basis, or during cross-deck operations, Marine Corps F-35Bs will likely go to sea aboard the Izumo class in the future. What aircraft might join them is somewhat more intriguing. Last week, at the Japan International Aerospace Exhibition in Tokyo, General Atomics Aeronautical Systems (GA-ASI) presented a rendering showing its carrier-capable Gambit 5 drone — which is based around a common modular core ‘chassis’ concept — operating from an Izumo class warship. Concept artwork showing the carrier-capable Gambit 5 drone operating from the Izumo. GA-ASI This is not the first time that we’ve seen the Gambit 5 presented on an aircraft carrier. The drone was revealed in the form of concept artwork showing it on a Queen Elizabeth class vessel for the United Kingdom at the Farnborough Airshow in July. You can read about the overarching Gambit 5 concept here. A rendering featuring a catapult-equipped Queen Elizabeth class carrier with a Gambit-series drone ready to launch. GA-ASI Regarding the Gambit 5 on the Izumo class, C. Mark Brinkley, a General Atomics spokesman, explained to TWZ: 'It’s meant to open the discussion with attendees on sea-based options for autonomous collaborative platforms because we see that as a very real opportunity for many nations.' As to the drone itself, while the Gambit 5 is now also being suggested for short takeoff and landing (STOL) operations from land bases, it was originally developed for shipboard use. A company rendering of the Gambit 5 operating from a flattop. GA-ASI 'The biggest challenges for Gambit 5 are sea-basing challenges, not specifically short takeoff and landing,' Brinkley added. 'The ship is moving, the deck is moving, the weather and climate play a role. We’ve invested years of research and investment on projects such as the U.S. Navy’s Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) program and Carrier-Based Aerial-Refueling System (CBARS). We understand the challenges to operating uncrewed jets at sea, and we know that Gambit 5 can be made real.' Putting advanced drones on carriers is a growing area of interest right now, with China, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States all exploring options of how best to integrate uncrewed platforms, of different sizes, on these warships. In particular, the potential for smaller aviation-capable vessels to operate drones is being explored, with Turkey notably even seeking to field a carrier that’s specifically tailored to support drones. The Turkish Navy flagship, Anadolu, which is planned to be used as a carrier for different tiers of armed drones. Photo by Serhat Cagdas/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images In the case of the Gambit 5 concept, the vessel is provided with catapults to launch the drones, as was the case with the Queen Elizabeth class concept. However, the British carrier differs from the Izumo class in being equipped with a ‘ski jump’ launch ramp, originally for STOVL operations. The British announced plans last year to integrate assisted launch systems and recovery gear onto the ships in the future. Although there is no confirmation at this stage that Japan plans something similar for its smaller Izumo class ships, it would make them able to operate fixed-wing drones, and potentially even other fixed-wing crewed aircraft. As well as the Gambit 5 and F-35B, the GA-ASI concept artwork shows F/A-18E Super Hornet fighters and an E-2 Hawkeye airborne early warning and control aircraft operating from the Izumo class. While Japan already operates the E-2 in a land-based capacity, it has no known plans to acquire fixed-wing carrier fighters in the Super Hornet class. A Japan Air Self-Defense Force E-2C Hawkeye during the Cope North exercise at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam. U.S. Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Courtney Witt Airman First Class Courtney Witt There are huge challenges in adapting carriers that are already fixed-wing-capable to accommodate even slightly larger aircraft, due to space requirements and the dimensions of existing elevators and other infrastructure. Even if Japan was in the market for carrier-based non-STOVL fighters and E-2s, whether they would be able to incorporate them in the Izumo class is another question entirely. Also shown in the artwork is an SH-60 Seahawk series helicopter, a type used by Japan previously aboard a wide range of warships, including the Izumo class. Not shown, but another important type for the Izumo class is the MV-22 Osprey tiltrotor, of which Japan is currently the only export operator. Nevertheless, the artwork does reflect the potential that the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) and the Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG) that GA-ASI first developed for the U.S. Navy’s Ford class aircraft carriers could also bring new capabilities to the Izumo class and other aviation-capable vessels. We have discussed in the past how EMALS and AAG are well suited to bringing drones into carrier air wings since they can be finely tuned in terms of the forces they exert on aircraft during launch and recovery. This makes them especially relevant for operators looking to utilize smaller and lighter drone designs from flattops. For Japan, having a carrier-capable drone like the Gambit 5 would provide a powerful adjunct to the F-35B. The Gambit 5 was derived from the air-to-air-capable Gambit 2, but it could also be used for strike as well as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). Drones such as the Gambit 5 and or the same company’s MQ-9B STOL could bring important boosts in capability and overall capacity to Japan’s carrier air wings, which are now very much in their infancy. Faced with the prospect of a potential confrontation with China, armed carrier-based drones could help Japan generate critical additional ‘mass,’ supporting F-35B missions including in more hazardous scenarios, engaging targets in the air, at sea, and on land. Even unarmed drones would be valuable force multipliers, conducting missions such as ISR, command and control, extending targeting capabilities, and boosting situational awareness. Meanwhile, a drone like the MQ-25 Stingray, provided it could be integrated on the Izumo, would deliver aerial refueling to extend the reach of the carriers’ F-35Bs. A prototype MQ-25 Stingray. Boeing www.twz.com At this stage, it’s not clear if Japan is actively planning to add drones to the future air wings of the Izumo class and, if it does, whether they would be fixed-wing types requiring launch and recovery gear to be added. 'We are absolutely talking to potential customers at Farnborough about the concept,' Brinkley said in the summer, when the Gambit 5 was unveiled, but did not name any specific prospective buyers. The U.S. Navy is already signaling the centrality of drones in future carrier operations, with plans to eventually have up to 60 percent uncrewed aircraft in its carrier air wings. Very likely, Japan is watching such developments closely and looking at the options for adding drones to its already very capable Izumo class vessels. Until then, Japan will continue to work toward having crewed stealth fighters operational on these two warships, with the recent test flights by a Marine Corps F-35B the latest step toward achieving this.

Smarter MQ-1C Gray Eagle Is Getting Mojave’s Short Field Capabili...	General Atomics Aeronautical Systems (GA-ASI) has provided details on the latest iteration of its MQ-1C Gray Eagle uncrewed aerial system (UAS), specifically the Gray Eagle STOL, or Short Takeoff and Landing variant. The new version of the drone incorporates technology that was first demonstrated on the company-funded Mojave, a heavily armed drone descended from the Gray Eagle that was also designed to be ideally suited to operating from remote or austere locations with rough strips and limited logistical support. The new drone is also very clearly pitched toward the U.S. Army and foreign customers that need increase distributed operations — as evidenced in the concept art at the top of this story — dispersed operations in the Pacific specifically. GA-ASI describes the Gray Eagle STOL as its 'most rugged UAS design,' although it’s worth noting at this point that the basic MQ-1C Gray Eagle for the U.S. Army was already something of a design that put a premium on efficiency and usability. Derived from the Air Force’s Predator, the Gray Eagle — originally known as the Warrior — was tailored for warfare in the Middle East, used a heavy-fuel piston engine instead of a turboprop, and was intended to be operated by a cadre of enlisted soldiers. A U.S. Army MQ-1C Gray Eagle. U.S. Marine Corps photo by Cpl. William Chockey A U.S. Army MQ-1C Gray Eagle at Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center (MCAGCC), Twentynine Palms, California. U.S. Marine Corps photo by Cpl. William Chockey Further reducing the footprint in terms of logistics and crews, the MQ-1C was designed to take off and land automatically through secure line-of-sight links, before flying beyond-line-of-sight missions via satellite communications. Enhancements for the MQ-1C soon followed, including an extended-range model with double the range and endurance, a test example staying aloft for nearly two days nonstop in a demonstration above Southern California. Building upon the MQ-1C Gray Eagle, GA-ASI is now offering the Gray Eagle STOL, which emphasizes the ability to operate from unimproved surfaces or even ships at sea, thanks to its short takeoff and landing capability, which was previously proven using the Mojave, first flown in 2021. GA-ASI’s Mojave demonstrator during takeoff and landing trials on a dirt strip near El Mirage, California, on August 1, 2023. GA-ASI Using the Gray Eagle STOL, 'commanders can choose virtually any bases of operation and take advantage of unconventional locations not normally affiliated with unmanned aircraft or aviation operations as an added level of survivability and surprise,' GA-ASI asserts. The Mojave’s ability to take off and land in very short distances — including on dirt strips — is something we have reported on before. Its stated performance includes a takeoff run of 400 feet for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions, or 1,000 feet when armed with 12 Hellfire missiles. Other weapons options include the Dillon Aero DAP-6 Minigun, which has been live-fire tested from the Mojave at Army’s Yuma Proving Ground. Its STOL attributes also lend the Mojave to shipborne operations, as demonstrated during trials aboard the British aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales. The short-field performance is such that the Mojave can also conduct carrier-based operations, in certain configurations, without any need for a catapult to launch it or arresting gear during recovery. This STOL performance has now been ported over to the Gray Eagle STOL, as C. Mark Brinkley, a General Atomics spokesman, described to TWZ. 'Mojave is simply a demonstrator model for our overall STOL concept, meant to show the possibilities afforded by our medium-altitude, long-endurance UAS when STOL capability is added. It’s one-of-a-kind and was not designed to go into production as it is currently built. We continue to use it as a technology demonstrator and have some upcoming demos scheduled, as well as some public showings planned at various trade shows next year.' With that in mind, the Gray Eagle STOL also adds some features that were not found on the Mojave. These include the various technologies introduced on another improved development of the MQ-1C, namely the Gray Eagle 25M (or GE 25M), first flown in December 2023. Gray Eagle 25M. GA-ASI The Gray Eagle 25M was developed to provide the U.S. Army with the option to procure a more advanced version of the MQ-1C, which would incorporate various enhancements to better meet the demands of a future conflict, likely to be expeditionary peer conflicts rather than a counterinsurgency fight. Among these new features are an improved heavy-fuel engine, increased onboard power, significantly reduced maintenance requirements, and an expeditionary laptop-based ground control station. Brinkley says the new Heavy Fuel Engine 2.0 'increases reliability, durability and horsepower, from 180 to 200 horsepower. It features dual brushless generators, which will dramatically reduce field maintenance and deliver over 50 percent more electrical power for new payloads and mission capabilities. The new engine, gearbox, and generator design decreases major maintenance actions and virtually eliminates the need for overhaul. The design effort was focused on reducing field maintenance and extending the time between engine replacement by 40 percent over the current Gray Eagle engine.' The Gray Eagle 25M also has an improved flight computer, with five times more processing capacity, and a modular open system architecture to ensure new capabilities can be integrated quickly and relatively cheaply. According to GA-ASI, these might include new air-launched effects and long-range sensors. In fact, the manufacturer is making a lot of the Gray Eagle 25M’s ability to work with air-launched effects. In one press release, GA-ASI lays out a scenario in which the Gray Eagle 25M lobs air-launched effects toward enemy air defense systems in a large and very contested battlefield. As the air-launched effects close in on the air defenses, the Gray Eagle 25M acts as 'quarterback,' relaying data gathered by the smaller drones to other friendly elements, be they aircraft, long-range fires, or other platforms. Concept artwork from GA-ASI showing a Gray Eagle 25M launching the company’s Eaglet air-launched drones. GA-ASI The Gray Eagle 25M is fitted as standard with the EagleEye synthetic aperture radar, which can detect and track ground targets out to 50 miles and maritime targets out to 124 miles. 'We are developing a new Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) antenna and associated software for EagleEye, which will further increase its range and deliver significant mode enhancements, Brinkley says. 'The radar’s increased range and optimized multi-mode performance will allow the aircraft to operate well outside the weapons effects zone of most threat systems, adding another layer of survivability.' Reflecting the increasing threat posed by hostile electronic warfare jamming, especially to GPS networks, the Gray Eagle 25M is also designed for greater resilience, including vision-based navigation that can be used to overcome GPS jamming, and SATCOM anti-jam technologies. GA-ASI says that all of the improvements found in the Gray Eagle 25M are now also incorporated in the Gray Eagle STOL. However, with different engines, wings, and tails, the Gray Eagle 25M and Gray Eagle STOL are very different aircraft, and the STOL version is not available as a conversion kit for GE 25M. The end result is a drone that combines advanced features with the ability to fly a wide variety of missions, from land and sea. At the forefront of the expected spectrum of missions are expeditionary ones of the kind that would be likely in any future high-end conflict, such as one in the Pacific against China. The Gray Eagle STOL is being pitched for reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (RSTA), as well as attack, contested logistics, and other missions, in just such scenarios. Logistics is not a role that has traditionally been associated with drones of this kind. However, GA-ASI has explored the idea of underwing pods capable of carrying up to 1,000 pounds of cargo. The U.S. military sees diverse distributed logistics chains as increasingly essential for supporting future operations in contested environments, especially in the context of a potential future high-end conflict, including in the Pacific. As GA-ASI describes it: 'Gray Eagle STOL might go with American forces into an expeditionary base deep downrange, co-locating with them as necessary to support missions, including delivery of supplies with the range to reach from island chain to island chain for units separate from the main body. Operating from a semi-prepared landing zone, a dirt road, or any paved surface, it expands commanders’ options.' As we have reported in the past, GA-ASI sees a particular niche for the Gray Eagle STOL in the U.S. Army’s requirement for an armed scout and overwatch platform. In February this year, the Army announced it was canceling its Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) program, which was focused on the acquisition of a new armed scout helicopter, as part of a broader reshuffling of its future aviation plans to include a greater focus on uncrewed systems. Concept artwork for the Boeing entry in the U.S. Army’s now-canceled Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft program, or FARA. Boeing www.twz.com 'We’re trying to jump into that [opportunity],' GA-ASI’s Alexander told Breaking Defense in a previous interview when talking about pitching the Gray Eagle STOL as potential a gap-filler in the wake of the FARA program’s cancellation. 'We believe a Gray Eagle STOL would offer the Army new attack reconnaissance capabilities unlike any previous uncrewed system,' GA-ASI’s Brinkley also told The War Zone. 'We have already demonstrated Mojave’s ability to operate from austere and rugged dirt roads, to take off and land from a ship at sea, and now to attack targets with machine gun fire.' Whether or not the Army decides that the new drone would be a good fit for its armed scout and overwatch requirements remains to be seen, especially with lingering concerns about the survivability and, by extension, the utility of non-stealthy medium-altitude armed drones like these. In its favor, like the Gray Eagle in service today, the Gray Eagle STOL can also team with AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, a capability of increasing importance within the Army. Also now being pitched by GA-ASI is the MQ-9B STOL, which will come in the form of a conversion kit conferring STOL capability on the existing MQ-9B SkyGuardian and SeaGuardian. MQ-9B SeaGuardian. GA-ASI GA-ASI 'We are taking the lessons learned from the Mojave prototype and Gray Eagle STOL program to develop MQ-9B STOL,' Brinkley told TWZ. 'One airframe, with multiple configurations and mission options. It’s a huge win for MQ-9B customers.' The MQ-9B STOL is a significantly bigger aircraft than the Gray Eagle 25M/STOL. The MQ-9B has a 38-foot fuselage, 79-foot wingspan, turboprop engine, and maximum takeoff weight of 12,500 pounds. This compares with a 28-foot fuselage, 58-foot wingspan, and maximum takeoff weight of 4,400 pounds for the GE 25M. At the very least, the Gray Eagle STOL and MQ-9B STOL signal that there remains a lot of potential within the original MQ-1C Gray Eagle and MQ-9B platforms, and GA-ASI is continuing to adapt these aircraft to better suit the future battlefield.

'Iran’s finger is on the trigger as a greater surprise is awaiting the Zionists,' Tasnim stated. An Iranian military source told the publication that 'if the Zionist regime strikes Iran’s military sites, Tehran’s response will be ‘decisive’ and ‘beyond the estimates of Zionists.’' If Israel targets Iran’s nuclear sites, 'Iran will react and also reconsider its nuclear policies, the source added.'

The ongoing Israeli response has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians. 'I cannot sit here today and tell you that that negotiations are about to restart in Doha or Cairo or anywhere else for that matter,' Kirby said in response to a question from CNN’s Kayla Tausche Monday. Biden is 'deeply concerned' about the disclosure of classified documents regarding Israel's plans for its retaliation against Iran that found their way into the public sphere, National Security communications spokesperson John Kirby told reporters Monday afternoon. The White House could not say at the moment whether the documents were leaked or hacked. 'You can rest assured that he will be actively monitoring the progress of the investigative effort to figure out how this happened,' Kirby said. The documents, dated October 15 and 16, began circulating online Friday after being posted on the Iranian-linked Middle East Spectator Telegram channel. 'An informed source within the U.S. intelligence community has shared with us an extremely sensitive 'top secret' U.S. intelligence document from the NGIA, dated Oct, 15-16, detailing Israeli preparedness for an extensive strike inside Iran,' Middle East Spectator claimed. One of the documents, which says it was compiled by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGIA), 'says the plans involve Israel moving munitions around,' according to CNN. 'Another document says it is sourced to the National Security Agency and outlines Israeli air force exercises involving air-to-surface missiles, also believed to be in preparation for a strike on Iran. CNN is not quoting directly from or showing the documents.' The documents are meant to be seen only by the US and its ‘Five Eyes’ allies — Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom,' according to CNN, adding that the US is investigating the leak, A US official said the investigation 'is examining who had access to the alleged Pentagon document. Any such leak would automatically trigger an investigation by the FBI alongside the Pentagon and US intelligence agencies,' the network noted. 'The FBI declined to comment.' While the U.S. said the documents are real, and there are no indications they are not, there is always the possibility that even parts of them were disclosed on purpose as part of an information operation.

Israeli officials said the paper came out of discussions Israeli Minister for Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer - a confidant of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - had with the Israeli Ministry of Defense and the Israel Defense Forces 'about the principles Israel demands to be part of any diplomatic solution to end the war with Hezbollah,' the publication reported. One Israeli demand 'is that the IDF be allowed to engage in 'active enforcement' to make sure Hezbollah doesn't rearm and rebuild its military infrastructure in the areas of southern Lebanon that are close to the border,' Axios reported, citing an Israeli official.

Earlier Monday, Israel Hayom reported that Hezbollah forces captured by the IDF in southern Lebanon testified in their investigations that Hezbollah paid money to UNIFIL personnel to use their bases for operations. 'These sources, privy to the details, revealed that Hezbollah also took control of UNIFIL cameras in compounds near the Israeli border and utilized them for their own purposes,' Israel Hayom reported. 'In light of these revelations and UNIFIL's glaring failure to prevent Hezbollah's entrenchment along the border Israel plans to rely primarily on commitments from the Lebanese army in any future arrangement with Lebanon, rather than on UNIFIL, which has proven ineffective over the years and is now accused of frequently collaborating with Hezbollah operatives.'

'Yet again, we remind the IDF and all actors of their obligations to ensure the safety and security of UN personnel and property and to respect the inviolability of UN premises at all times,' UNIFIL stated. The mission also reiterated 'that the violation of a UN site and damage to its assets constitutes a flagrant violation of international law and Security Council resolution 1701, the unanimously adopted text to end to a 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah and chart a path towards security on the border between Israel and Lebanon.' In addition, it stated that the Israeli army 'has repeatedly asked UNIFIL to vacate its positions along the Blue Line and has deliberately damaged UN positions.' Despite the pressure on the mission and troop-contributing countries, UNIFIL stressed that peacekeepers remain in all their positions, the mission’s statement said on Sunday.

Our First Look At Land-Based Aegis Missile Defense System In Guam	We have gotten what appears to be our first view of a Mk 41 vertical launch system (VLS) for the Aegis Ashore air defense system that has been installed on the highly strategic American island of Guam in the Pacific. The land-based Mk 41 launchers are one step toward addressing the vulnerabilities of the U.S. military bases on the island to attack — something that China, in particular, has directly referenced in the context of a full-scale conflict in the region. Ultimately, Aegis Ashore on Guam will be just one element in plans to make the island’s airspace the most heavily defended anywhere on Earth. A photo showing the VLS array installed in an above-ground structure was published by the Defense Visual Information Distribution Service (DVIDS) on October 17. The image was part of a series from Joint Task Force Micronesia showing a visit to the island by Acting Under Secretary of the Navy Tom Mancinelli. Acting Under Secretary of the Navy Tom Mancinelli is greeted by Navy Cmdr. Mark Klein, commanding officer of Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron (HSC) 25, during a tour of Guam, Oct. 17. U.S. Navy photo by William J. Busby III William Busby According to information provided by DVIDS, Mancinelli received briefings from military leaders on 'critical defense infrastructure, force readiness, and emerging threats in the Indo-Pacific region.' Mancinelli was also shown flying over the island in a U.S. Navy MH-60 Seahawk helicopter, all part of his gaining a 'comprehensive understanding of key strategic locations across the island, highlighting Guam's essential role in U.S. military operations and regional security.' Acting Under Secretary of the Navy Tom Mancinelli tours Guam by helicopter with Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron (HSC) 25 on Oct. 16, 2024. U.S. Navy photo by William J. Busby III William Busby Most intriguing, however, is the photo showing the Mk 41 VLS array, the caption of which actually describes Mancinelli’s tour of a different air defense system — the U.S. Army Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery on the island. As TWZ has discussed before, THAAD has been deployed continuously to the island for many years now. It was sent there particularly to counter the possibility of a North Korean strike, as well as any other potential contingencies, but the growing threat from China far eclipses that of North Korea. As part of the efforts to drastically upgrade Guam’s defenses, the U.S. Navy is installing a version of the Aegis Ashore system on Guam, in addition to similar facilities in Poland and Romania, plus a dedicated test site in Hawaii. The U.S. Aegis Ashore site in Romania. USN Typically, Aegis Ashore facilities comprise a main ‘deckhouse’ and associated support building, as well as the VLS arrays seen in the photo at the top of this article. The deckhouse accommodates the Aegis Combat System and AN/SPY-1 radar, among other things, and mimics portions of Flight IIA Arleigh Burke class destroyers. This reflects the Aegis Ashore’s heritage in the sea-based Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) system, which you can read about in more detail here. Aegis Ashore is primarily designed to engage ballistic threats during the midcourse portion of their flight outside the Earth's atmophere using SM-3 interceptors. However, the Mk 41 is a modular launcher, meaning that additional anti-missile interceptors, such as the terminal-stage intercept and anti-air SM-6 and the forthcoming Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI), which could also be added. With its ability to take down certain incoming hypersonic threats, as well as other weapons, the GPI could be especially relevant for the defense of Guam. With additional launchers, even dispersed around the island, shorter-ranged missiles, such as the Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) Block II and even the latest SM-2s, could feasibly provide protection against air breathing threats, such as cruise missiles and drones. Patriot interceptors are now also now a possibility. While its capabilities are much in demand, there are various issues that make the installation of the traditional Aegis Ashore more complicated in Guam. Not only does the island have limited space for such a facility with the right lines of sight for its radar and radio systems, but the terrain is mountainous. In its basic configuration, Aegis Ashore needs a relatively large amount of flat open space and it has to be positioned to maximize radar coverage relative to potential threats. The difficulty in installing Aegis Ashore in an environment like this contributed to Japan’s decision to abandon its own plans for the system. An MDA briefing slide showing a notional layout of the Aegis Ashore site in Poland, as of 2013, given a sense of the physical space requirements. MDA As TWZ wrote in the past, 'placing portions of a future Aegis Ashore system on Guam in facilities underneath mountains or on mobile platforms on land, or even just off the coast, could certainly help with figuring out exactly how to make it work, from a basic design perspective, within the physical limitations that the island imposes.' The U.S. military previously said they planned to have the site operational by 2026. We have approached the Navy for comment on the current status of Aegis Ashore on Guam. Ultimately, Aegis Ashore should be much better adapted to Guam’s specific requirements, forming part of the planned Enhanced Integrated Air and Missile Defense (EIAMD) system. Last year, the U.S. military revealed that a total of 20 separate sites were currently under consideration to host surface-to-air interceptors, radars, and more, under EIAMD. A map showing the 20 sites on Guam under consideration to host elements of the Enhanced Integrated Air and Missile Defense system. MDA Using a distributed and tiered ‘system of systems’ approach, EIAMD is planned to provide 360-degree air and missile defense for Guam, with capabilities to deal with a wide spectrum of aerial threats. While the VLS array photographed last week may look familiar, overall, Aegis Ashore in Guam will probably look very different from the sites in Eastern Europe. As well as the potential to integrate additional missiles into the versatile Mk 41 VLS, Guam’s Aegis Ashore could have its various elements distributed to a much more significant degree than its predecessors, improving survivability and making better use of the island’s challenging geography. In the past, there was talk of the possibility that portions of Guam’s Aegis Ashore site could go into bunkers underground or onto mobile platforms or even vessels. Based on this one photo, the site uses the standard above-ground structure for its VLS — at least for now. A satellite image of Guam. Google Earth 'I can see Aegis being underground or mobile,' the Missile Defense Agency’s (MDA) director, U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Jon Hill, said, back in 2021. 'It’s not new science separating radars from weapons.' That might still be an option in the future, especially as the Pentagon is well aware of the potential vulnerabilities of a fixed above-ground facility, especially in a major conflict with a near-peer adversary, like China. EIAMD will also include at least four AN/TPY-6 radars, which were formerly known as the Homeland Defense Radar-Guam. This radar makes use of technology developed for the Lockheed Martin Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) used in Alaska. The Long Range Discrimination Radar at Clear Space Force Station, Alaska. MDA MISSILE DEFENSE AGENCY As we have discussed previously, regardless of any vulnerabilities that might be inherent in the static and above-ground nature of the basic system, Aegis Ashore is intended to primarily provide an additional line of defense against limited ballistic missile strikes launched by smaller ‘rogue’ actors, such as Iran. It is not seen as a broader strategic deterrent or a more robust missile defense capability for an all-out war with a peer competitor. Taken by itself, Aegis Ashore would be vulnerable to attack by China, which would use saturation strikes by its growing ballistic missile arsenal to overwhelm it, as it targeted the various U.S. military bases across the island. However, in Guam, Aegis Ashore by itself would be more about providing complementary coverage to other anti-missile defenses, including the aforementioned THAAD. That system has its own limitations, only being capable of intercepting ballistic missiles in the terminal stages of their flight. At the same time, its AN/TYP-2 radar is unidirectional, so it cannot provide 360-degree coverage against incoming threats. But as the island's defenses rapidly evolve, Aegis ashore will be a core component of the sprawling Enhanced Integrated Air and Missile Defense system. Patriot, directed energy systems, and the Army's new Enduring Shield lower-tier air defense system, among others. are all likely to play a part. Taken together, this highly diverse and distributed system, which will also be able to link with warships, aircraft, and especially space-based surveillance systems, will make Guam arguably the most highly defended piece of land on the planet. A transporter-erector-launcher for interceptors associated with the THAAD system. DOD At the same time, even with the best air defenses available, wider concerns about survivability are driving the U.S. military to work on expanding its available basing options across the Pacific, to provide alternatives to well-established bases like those in Guam. This includes alternate operating locations on nearby islands in the Marianas archipelago. Even though questions remain about how Aegis Ashore in Guam will eventually look and what kinds of more survivable and other elements will be included in the overall air defense architecture, the photo of the new VLS underscores the fact that the Pentagon is now on its way to drastically upgrading the island's defenses. Hopefully the move to finally do so isn't too little, too late.

Questions Linger Over Australia’s Role In B-2 Spirit Strikes On Y...	The U.S. Air Force used air bases in Australia to support the strikes on Houthi weapons bunkers in Yemen by B-2 stealth bombers earlier this week. At this point, there is some confusion as to whether B-2s were among the aircraft that used Australian bases, but USAF tankers likely supported the bombers, launching refueling operations from Australian soil. You can read our initial coverage and analysis of the B-2 strikes in Yemen here. Regardless, the development reflects the expanding military and strategic alliance between the United States and Australia, which has included upgrades for Australian air bases, specifically to better accommodate U.S. bombers. The Australian Department of Defense has confirmed that Australian support for the U.S. strikes on Yemen on the night of October 16/17 did include 'access and overflight for U.S. aircraft in northern Australia.' A report from Australia’s national broadcaster ABC stated that 'A remote Northern Territory air base has been used as a staging post for this week’s major U.S. airstrike on underground Houthi weapons stores in Yemen.' This could point to Royal Australian Air Force Base Tindal, a remote installation south of Darwin, which has been receiving upgrades to better accommodate U.S. bomber deployments, as you can read about here. The work is projected to be completed in late 2026. Available low-resolution satellite imagery for the dates in question doesn’t show any B-2s at Tindal — which is not conclusive in itself — but there are other possible operating locations in northern Australia, including some auxiliary installations. RAAF Tindal seen in May of 2024 with the new apron for supporting U.S. bombers under construction. (Google Earth) Subsequently, the same broadcaster reported that the Australian Department of Defense would not confirm or deny whether U.S. aircraft involved in the strikes had taken off from Tindal. The emphasis on taking off may be critical here, as we will discuss later. The ABC report on the subject was then altered to include a statement from an Australian Department of Defense spokesperson who said that B-2s were not operating out of Tindal, but would not provide further comments, due to operational security. There has been plenty of speculation that B-2s at least used Tindal to recover to, landing there after the Yemen raid. That remains possible since the later Australian Department of Defense comment was in response to a question as to whether the stealth bombers were operating out of the base (i.e. taking off for the raid) as opposed to landing there afterward. As for the official U.S. line, this appears to point to a roundtrip from Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri, the main operating base for the type, although it may be the case that one or more Australian bases were made available as an alternative landing site, after the mission. If the flight was direct, it would have literally flown around the world. According to multiple US officials: The American B2 stealth bombers dropped multi-thousand pound bombs, not GBU-57's, on 5 underground Houthi weapons storage targets in Yemen last night. The choice of the B2, which flew roundtrip from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, was…&mdash; Jennifer Griffin (@JenGriffinFNC) October 17, 2024 The periodic presence of U.S. bombers in Australia is by no means new, dating back to the early 1980s, while larger-scale training exercises in the country have involved U.S. bombers since 2005. More recently, the Enhanced Air Cooperation Initiative has been in place, involving deeper efforts to have the RAAF and U.S. military aircraft work closer together, with regular bomber rotations since 2018. B-2s have been regular visitors to Australia in recent years, with four of the stealth bombers having deployed to RAAF Base Amberley, in Queensland, in 2022, something you can read more about here.

Photos — backed up by some satellite imagery — show KC-135 Stratotankers and KC-46 Pegasus tankers at Cairns Airport in Queensland and more KC-135s at RAAF Amberley, soon after the strikes. Even if B-2s didn’t make use of Australian bases for the raid, it seems that U.S. tankers did, which would explain references to 'access and overflight for U.S. aircraft in northern Australia.' An Australian official further told ABC that the support Australia provided was 'consistent with our long-standing alliance commitment and close cooperation, demonstrating the interoperability of our militaries.' 'Australia is committed to supporting the U.S., and key partners, in disrupting Houthi capabilities used to threaten global trade and the lives of mariners in the Red Sea, a vital international waterway,' an Australian Department of Defense spokesperson added.

U.S. Air Force photo by Staff Sgt. Spencer Tobler Staff Sgt. Spencer Tobler While the raids may well have degraded the Houthis’ ability to wage their ongoing campaign against shipping in the Red Sea region, as TWZ previously pointed out, they were also tailored to deliver a powerful and highly specific message to Iran, the Houthis’ primary benefactor. At this point, it’s unclear if that message was underscored by the use of the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, better known as the MOP, a weapon ideal for attacking targets including the extremely hardened sites related to Iran’s nuclear program. This looked like a distinct possibility, especially due to the fact that B-2s were used for the strikes. The MOP, weighing in around 30,000 pounds, can only be carried by the B-2. Two can be carried by each of the stealth bombers at a time. So far, the Air Force has not confirmed what weapons were used, although Air & Space Forces Magazine reports that the B-2s dropped 2,000-pound BLU-109-equipped GBU-31 Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM), citing a 'person familiar with the matter.' Munitions maintainers from around the Pacific assemble BLU-109 munitions at Osan Air Base, South Korea. U.S. Air Force photo/Staff Sgt. Stephenie Wade Staff Sergeant Stephenie Wade The BLU-109 is another precision munition with a penetrating warhead. Each B-2 can carry 16 of these weapons. It’s also possible that 5,000-pound class bunker-busters might have been used, although the exact status of this weapon in the B-2’s inventory is unclear. A very early graphic from the MOP program showing the bomb able to penetrate up to 60 feet under the ground. By 2007, the weapon was reportedly capable of burrowing nearly four times deeper than this. This also offers a comparison between the 2,000lb BLU-109-equipped guided bomb and 5,000lb GBU-28. DOD via GlobalSecurity.org As we reported at the time, whatever type of bunker-buster munitions were used by the B-2s, the raid was a very clear signal to Iran that the United States is uniquely well equipped to target critical facilities 'no matter how deeply buried underground, hardened, or fortified,' in the words of a Pentagon statement. While Iran was not mentioned by name, the implication is very clear. While acknowledging that it provided support to the United States, specifically in its effort to blunt the Houthis’ ability to target Red Sea shipping, Australia also didn’t mention Iran by name. Darwin lawmaker Luke Gosling told ABC that Australia works 'incredibly closely with the U.S. Air Force' in the north. Gosling added that there are 'no deliberate messages being sent from Australia, other than we are in lock-step with our allies in order to uphold a rules-based order upon which Australia’s security and prosperity is so dependent.' The most obvious example of the deepening relationship between Australia and the United States is the AUKUS initiative — standing for Australia, United Kingdom, United States. This is a wide-ranging effort, with standout items including the supply of nuclear-powered attack submarines to Australia, and increased intelligence sharing. A RAAF F-35A Lightning II, EA-18G Growler, and F/A-18F Super Hornet fly alongside a U.S. Air Force B-52H from the 23rd Expeditionary Bomb Squadron based at Guam during Exercise Talisman Sabre 21. Australian Department of Defense SGT Andrew Eddie At the same time, the United States has been ramping up bomber deployments at Tindal, while also sending bombers to other Australian air bases, as Washington continues to expand its military presence in the region. The upgrade work at Tindal includes an expanded apron with space for up to six B-52 strategic bombers, squadron operations facilities, and maintenance infrastructure. Once completed, the airbase will be much better able to host bomber detachments, as well as tankers and fighters, with work also addressing fuel and munitions storage and mission planning buildings. Work at Tindal, as well as AUKUS and other related developments, have been widely seen as a deterrent aimed toward China. While that remains true, it is now clear that the growing U.S. military footprint in Australia is also being leveraged to strike targets in the Middle East. Significantly, Tindal will add another forward operating location for U.S. bombers, on top of Hawaii, Guam, and Diego Garcia, also in the broader region. Although with appropriate tanker support, there is no reason why bombers can’t also use the base to support operations in the Middle East or elsewhere. It remains to be seen whether RAAF Base Tindal or any other base was used for the first time by B-2s conducting combat operations, but the fact that Australia was used to support air operations over Yemen, in and of itself, is a significant development, at a time of increasing military cooperation with the United States.

South Korea Intelligence Offers Assessment Of North Korean Troops...	South Korea’s spy agency released images on Friday claiming to show North Korean troops training at military bases in Russia’s far eastern region. The National Intelligence Service (NIS) said they are the initial wave of what South Korean officials say will be 12,000 North Korean troops, including members of its notorious special forces, fighting in Russia’s all-out war on Ukraine. 'The suspicions of ‘direct military cooperation between Russia and North Korea’ raised by foreign media outlets have been officially confirmed,' NIS stated. 'We will continue to track and confirm the movement of military cooperation between Russia and North Korea through close intelligence cooperation with allied countries.' That information comes a day after Ukraine’s spy boss told us that there are currently nearly 11,000 North Korean troops in eastern Russia, who will be ready to fight by Nov. 1. On Friday, Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, head of the Ukrainian Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR), told us that figure was revised upward to 11,800. At least six of Pyongyang’s forces, as we previously noted, have already been killed in Ukraine. The North Korean soldiers dispatched to Russia 'are currently stationed at Russian military bases in the Far East, including Vladivostok, Ussuriysk, Khabarovsk, and Blagoveshchensk,' South Korea’s National Intelligence Service (NIS) stated in a new assessment released Friday. Those troops 'are expected to be deployed to the front lines as soon as they complete their adaptation training.' All four bases are at least 4,000 miles east of Ukraine. NIS released images purporting to show at least 400 North Korean troops training at Ussuriysk and at least 240 at Khabarovsk. However, the number of troops and if they are even North Korean cannot be confirmed by the satellite imagery provided. A military facility in Ussuriisk, Primorsky Krai that South Korea's spy agency says shows an estimated 400 North Korean personnel gathered on a parade ground. (NIS) NIS claims there are about 240 North Korean troops gathered at a Russian military base in Khabarovsk. (NIS) NIS said it began observing North Korean troops in Russia back in early August. It detected First Vice Director of the Munitions Industry Department Kim Jong-sik - 'a key figure in North Korea’s missile development' - 'visiting the North Korean KN-23 missile launch site near the Russia-Ukraine frontline several times with dozens of North Korean military officers and providing on-site guidance,' the spy agency said in the assessment. NIS then 'closely monitored' the movements of the North Korean military and detected North Korea 'transporting its special forces to Russia via Russian naval transport ships from [Aug] 8th to the 13th, confirming the start of the North Korean military’s participation in the war.' To move these troops, the Russian Navy entered North Korean waters for the first time since 1900, according to NIS. '&#8230;four landing ships and three escort ships belonging to the Russian Pacific Fleet completed the first transfer of approximately 1,500 North Korean special forces from the areas near Chongjin, Hamhung, and Musudan to Vladivostok, Russia during the same period, and a second transport operation is expected to take place soon,' NIS explained. With more than 120,000 troops, North Korea has one of the world's largest special operations forces. They are tasked with five basic missions: conducting reconnaissance, performing combat operations in conjunction with conventional operations, establishing a second front in South Korea’s rear areas, countering South Korean/U.S. special operations forces in North Korea’s rear area, and maintaining internal security. Above all else, causing mayhem deep behind the front lines during a war with the South would be on the top of their to do list. It is known that these troops are North Korea's most hardened and go through extremely harsh training. Videos of their brutal demonstration have been circulating for years. NIS released a synthetic aperture radar satellite image claiming to show Russian ships at Musudan, less than 200 miles south of Vladivostok. The nature of the image makes that impossible to confirm without other supporting evidence. South Korea's spy agency claims this synthetic aperture radar satellite image shows Russian ships transporting North Korean troops to Russia. (NIS) This graphic from South Korea's spy agency claims to show the route Russian ships are taking to transport North Korean troops in the East Sea. (NIS) In addition, Russian Air Force AN-124 cargo jets 'have been frequently traveling between Vladivostok and Pyongyang,' NIS said. Before departing for Russia, North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un 'inspected the special forces unit twice before the deployment' on Sept. 11 and Oct. 2, according to NIS. North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un observed his special operations forces training before they departed for Russia. (NIS) The North Korean soldiers 'were issued Russian military uniforms and Russian-made weapons, and were also issued fake ID cards for residents of the Yakutia and Buryat regions of Siberia who look similar to North Koreans. It appears that they disguised themselves as Russian soldiers to hide the fact that they were deployed to the battlefield. Budanov confirmed that to The War Zone Friday. 'The first battalion of 2,600 troops will be formed in the 11th Airborne Brigade and are preparing for deployment in the Kursk region with documents of cover as Russian citizens from the Buryat and Yakutia regions,' he told The War Zone exclusively. In addition to what the NIS shared, other videos emerged on social media purporting to show North Korean troops training and being equipped in Russia. Video's have surfaced online allegedly showing North Korean soldiers at a Russian military base. The authenticity remains uncertain. If these are really North Korean soldiers is unconfirmed. pic.twitter.com/Ddzcn87NA3&mdash; NOELREPORTS (@NOELreports) October 18, 2024 Exclusive - Newly obtained footage from Russia's Sergievsky Training Ground showing North Korean troops being outfitted in Russian gear in preparation for deployment to Ukraine. pic.twitter.com/01Z4jZIiOe&mdash; SPRAVDI — Stratcom Centre (@StratcomCentre) October 18, 2024 The NIS assessment came after South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol 'convened an emergency security meeting amid mounting speculation that the North may be providing its soldiers to fight Russia's war in Ukraine,' the South Korean Yonhap News Agency reported. The presidential office said South Korea 'has been closely tracking North Korea's troop movement to Russia from the beginning in coordination with its allies, and will continue to monitor the situation and take all necessary measures proactively.' The North's move 'signals a major development in the military cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang besides their suspected arms trade, already criticized by the international community,' Yonhap posited. We reached out to the Pentagon and White House National Security Council for additional details and will update this story with any pertinent information they provide. This all comes in the wake of recent treaty negotiations between Moscow and Pyongyang. As we previously reported, Russian President Vladimir Putin submitted a draft law to the Russian State Duma recently seeking ratification of a strategic partnership between Moscow and Pyongyang, hammered out in June. It calls for each side to provide military assistance to each other in the event of war. Seoul has said it was considering changing its policy against providing lethal aide to Ukraine in response to that pact. In addition to offering new details about North Korean troop movements to Russia, NIS provided more granularity about Pyongyang’s shipment of arms to Moscow. NIS 'assessed that North Korea had provided Russia with a total of 13,000 containers of shells, missiles, and anti-tank rockets, as well as other lethal weapons, on approximately 70 occasions since August of last year.' The South Korean spy agency released satellite images purporting to be some of the vessels in North Korea's Nanjin port transporting the weapons to Russia. The Russian ship roll on/roll off container carrier Angara carrying North Korean weapons departing from Najin Port. (NIS) The Russian roll on/roll off container carrier Lady R carrying North Korean weapons departing from Najin Port. (NIS) As a result of GUR 'confirming North Korean weapons collected from the battlefield, the weapons North Korea provided to Russia included 122mm and 152mm shells, Bulsae-4 anti-tank missiles, short-range ballistic missiles such as the KN-23, and RPG anti-tank rockets,' the South Korean spy agency assessed. 'Considering the size of containers loaded on cargo ships traveling between North Korea and Russia, it appears that a total of more than 8 million 122mm and 152mm shells have been provided to Russia so far.' As we previously wrote, the Ukrainian government announced that the KN-23 short-range ballistic missiles that North Korea provided to Russia were used in attacks on major cities, including the Ukrainian capital Kyiv resulting in a significant number of civilian casualties. 'However, Ukrainian intelligence authorities analyzed that many North Korean weapons have a high defect rate and low accuracy, so they are being used for mass offensives to maintain the front line rather than precision strikes,' NIS added. As the war in Ukraine grinds on, North Korea's supply of troops and arms to Russia helps Vladimir Putin continue his fight. The Pentagon recently said that some 600,000 Russian troops have been killed and wounded since the all-out invasion was launched in February 2022 and that September saw the highest rate of casualties of any month since. Meanwhile, this could just be the start of a much larger deployment of North Korean forces to Russia. Pyongyang's greatest asset is the number of troops it has, with one of the largest standing armies on earth. While many are poorly trained and fed, Kim could trade large numbers of troops to Russia in exchange for things it desperately needs - hard currency, food and other goods, and military assistance. Russian doctrine is on display in Ukraine, flowing huge numbers of troops in so-called 'meat assaults' against Ukrainian positions. Even untrained North Koreans would help Russia continue to carry out those attacks. North Korea will also gain highly valuable combat experience on a modern battlefield, something it currently lacks. It remains to be seen just how well the North Korean troops will perform, but one South Korean military observer told us they will prove challenging to Ukraine. 'North Korean combat troops in Ukraine is alarming but not surprising,' said In-Bum Chun, a retired South Korean lieutenant general who ran that nation's special operations forces and is now a military analyst. 'They are the pick of the crop.' The public reaction in South Korea to news of North Korea sending troops to Ukraine 'is surprise and concern about the implications of these activities,' said Chun. 'I am sure the Ukrainians will have a challenge.'

Army Wants Its New Tank-Busting 155mm Artillery Shells To Work Co...	The U.S. Army is looking to give its still-in-development anti-armor guided 155mm artillery shells the ability to 'collaborate' with each other to help find their targets and otherwise be more effective. The rounds as they are envisioned now are already set to give artillery units a new option for engaging enemy tanks and other armored vehicles, even ones on the move, via indirect fires. Army Col. Leon Rogers, the service's Project Manager for Combat Ammunition Systems, provided an update on the Cannon Delivered Area Effects Munition Armor (C-DAEM Armor) 155mm shell, now also designated as the XM1180, at the Association of the U.S. Army's (AUSA) main annual conference in Washington, D.C., earlier this week. The C-DAEM Armor round, also known as C-DAEM Increment I, has been in development since 2018. The Army conducted the first live firing of a guided test article just this past March. A slide Col. Leon Rogers showed at this year's AUSA gathering showing plans for the C-DAEM Armor shell and other 155mm artillery ammunition developments. US Army 'C-DAEM Armor, XM1180, most people don't really know what that means, but what that gives the artillery community is a way to actually destroy armored targets,' Rogers explained. 'As you see in the future, it's about collaboration. Those rounds will be able to talk to each other.' Rogers highlighted specifically how this capability could help ensure that rounds don't double up on the same targets, facilitating a single barrage to engage and destroy more vehicles over a broader area. Networking the shells together could have other benefits, including helping the rounds fired find targets at all, even if they might be outside the range of their own onboard seekers. Depending on the level of collaboration and coordination between shells, as well as the ability of their seekers to not only spot, but categorize targets, they might also be able to focus their attention on target types that are pre-designated as being higher priority first. The current XM1180 design leverages the existing GPS-assisted inertial navigation system (INS) guided M982 Excalibur precision-guided 155mm shell, but adds a new and still unspecified all-weather seeker to find targets in the terminal stage of flight. There are future plans to develop a guidance package that is also less reliant on GPS to be more resilient in the face of jamming and spoofing, the importance of which has been underscored by observations from the ongoing war in Ukraine. C-DAEM Armor also features a new unitary shaped-charge armor-piercing warhead. In the past, it has been reported that the round is expected to have a maximum range of around 37 miles (60 kilometers) and the ability to scan up to nearly 11 square miles (28 square kilometers) for target vehicles. 'After the projectile has been fired, the sensors on the projectile will be used to search the area around its reported position, and if found, attack the target,' Peter Burke, Deputy Project Manager for Combat Ammunition Systems, said back in 2019, according to a report from Army Technology. As already noted, giving XM1180s the ability to collaborate between themselves could help eliminate the 'if found' from that equation and also help prevent targets from escaping being struck. The Army is not the only service to be interested in collaborative capabilities to improve targeting efficiency and effectiveness, as well as just reduce the number of munitions that are expended without hitting targets at all. The U.S. Air Force's Golden Horde program centered on the development of swarming networked air-launched munitions capabilities is one prime publicly known example. The baseline C-DAEM shell is already poised to give Army 155mm howitzers a valuable new precision indirect anti-armor capability. The Army's current Excalibur guided 155mm rounds cannot engage moving targets. The 1970s-era laser-guided M712 Copperhead 155mm shell, which was largely removed from service years ago, could hit moving vehicles, but also required a third party of some kind relatively close by to designate the target. As a prime example of the M712's limitations, earlier this year, The Wall Street Journal reported that Ukrainian forces had received Copperheads as military aid from the United States, but rarely employed them due to a lack of suitably equipped drones it could use to designate targets from afar. The Army also has unguided Dual-Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions (DPICM) shells, which are loaded with cluster munitions designed to defeat armored and unarmored targets. Cluster munitions, in general, have been increasingly controversial, in large part due to their potential to scatter unexploded submuntiions that can be threatening to friendly forces and innocent bystanders. You can read more about DPICM and these issues here. In addition to the XM1180, the Army is also currently developing a second round in the C-DAEM family called the XM1208, which is loaded with nine sensor-fuzed smart submunitions as a DPICM replacement. All of this now comes as the conflict in Ukraine has further underscored the value of artillery, particularly 155mm howitzers, on the modern battlefield, including for engaging enemy armor formations. On top of the Copperheads, the Ukrainian armed forces have received Excaliburs and DPICM rounds, among others, from the U.S. military. Recent videos from Ukraine’s 47th Mechanized Brigade showing FPV, DPICM, and Bradley fire on a Russian MT-LB with infantry; FPV strike on a Russian T-80BV tank with a roof screen causing a catastrophic loss; a Bradley IFV firing on Russian positions; and a video of a Russian… pic.twitter.com/hqgXVsra5e&mdash; Rob Lee (@RALee85) May 19, 2024 The U.S. military is working hard now to facilitate a dramatic boost in the production of 155mm shells of all kinds, including through the establishment of an entire new ammunition factory in the United States, to help meet Ukraine's demands as well as replenish its own stockpiles. At AUSA this week, Army officials said that 155mm shell production is now around 40,000 rounds per month, up from 14,400 shells per month prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The goals now are to get that figure up to 55,000 shells per month by the end of the year and eventually up to 100,000 shells per month in the future. Beyond more capacity to produce complete rounds, meeting these targets also requires expanded sources for various subcomponents, including shell bodies and explosive fillers. 'We don't get our TNT from any source in the U.S. right now,' Col. Rogers noted this week. 'And, oh, by the way, before the Ukraine war kicked off, just where we were getting our TNT from? Ukraine.' For the U.S. Army, there is also a growing question about what will fire C-DAEM Armor and any other 155mm shells in the future. The service announced this week that it was launching a new Self-Propelled Howitzer Modernization (SPH-M) effort to succeed its abortive Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA) program. The Army had announced in March that it was canceling work on the next-generation XM1299 155mm self-propelled howitzer it had been developing under ERCA as a successor to the venerable M109 series, due in part to issues with its extremely long cannon. The service has now awarded contracts to American Rheinmetall Vehicles, BAE Bofors, Hanwha Defense USA, General Dynamics Land Systems, and Elbit Systems USA to demonstrate alternative 155mm self-propelled howitzers as part of SPH-M. There have been separate discussions in recent years about options for modernizing or supplanting the Army's inventory of 155mm M777 and 105mm M109 towed howitzers, as well. A prototype the US Army had used in the development of the XM1299. US Army The Army has also said previously that the end of ERCA has put new emphasis on new, advanced 155mm shells, including long-range ramjet-powered types. The new C-DAEM Armor shell is already set to be an important part of that 155mm ammunition ecosystem and networked targeting capabilities could make artillery units even more effective in hunting enemy tanks and other vehicles in the future.

Nearly 11,000 North Korean Troops In Russia Preparing To Enter Th...	There are now nearly 11,000 North Korean infantry troops training in eastern Russia to fight in Ukraine, the head of the Ukrainian Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR) told The War Zone Thursday afternoon. 'They will be ready [to fight in Ukraine] on Nov. 1,' Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov told TWZ. The North Korean troops will be using Russian equipment and ammunition, said Budanov. The first cadre of 2,600 soldiers will go to Kursk, where Ukraine has established a heavily fought-over foothold (more on that later). It is unclear where the remaining North Korean troops will go, he added. 'We don't have the full picture right now,' said Budanov. Pyongyang's forces, as we previously noted, have already been killed in Ukraine. There are 11,000 North Korean troops training in Russia to fight Ukraine, Ukrainian Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, commander of the Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR), told us.(Howard Altman) Howard Altman Budanov’s comments came hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told reporters in Brussels that there are about 10,000 North Korean troops preparing to fight his country on behalf of Russia. Zelensky warned that a third nation wading into the hostilities would turn the conflict into a 'world war,' The Associated Press reported. The Ukrainian leader did not go into further details. Zelenskyy claims 10,000 North Korean troops are preparing to enter the war with Russia and some officers already been in occupied Ukraine helping the Russian armed forces use weapons provided by Pyongyang. via @HenryJFoy Christopher Miller (@ChristopherJM) October 17, 2024 A day earlier, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said in Seoul that Washington and its allies are alarmed by North Korea’s military support for Russia’s war in Ukraine but couldn’t confirm Ukrainian claims that North Korean soldiers were sent to fight for Moscow. On Tuesday, Ukrainian media reported that about 3,000 troops were forming part of the 'Special Buryat Battalion,' organized within the 11th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade of the Russian Armed Forces to fight in Ukraine.' As we previously reported, Russian President Vladimir Putin submitted a draft law to the Russian State Duma on Monday seeking ratification of a strategic partnership between Moscow and Pyongyang, hammered in June. It calls for each side to provide military assistance to each other in the event of war. In another sign of the burgeoning relationship between Moscow and Pyongyang, a report emerged on Thursday claiming that Russian troops are training to use North Korean self-propelled artillery. The Ukrainian-aligned ATESH group claimed on Telegram that a Russian soldier who is part of the organization said the training is underway at the Higher Artillery Command School in Saratov, about 300 miles east of Ukraine. ATESH did not specify what variant of self-propelled artillery North Korea provided. While The War Zone cannot independently verify this, we have written frequently about how North Korea is supporting Russia, including supplying ballistic missiles, artillery ammunition, and now, apparently, troops. russian military begins training on North Korean self-propelled gunsAn agent of the ATESH movement from the russian Armed Forces reports that in Saratov, at the recently restored Higher Artillery Command School, training of artillerymen on North Korean self-propelled… pic.twitter.com/gL5flsTOZa&mdash; Lew Anno Suport#Israel #Ukraine 24/2-22 (@anno1540) October 17, 2024 The Pentagon is looking into reports about North Korean troops fighting on behalf of Russia, but could not confirm them, Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told The War Zone during a press conference Thursday afternoon. 'If true, that would demonstrate an increase in the cooperation between Russia and North Korea, and I think that would also demonstrate the dire situation [Russia] finds itself in, in terms of its forces on the battlefield,' said Ryder. 'As you heard us recently say, the casualties that Russia is experiencing on the front lines are extremely significant, upward of 600,000 killed or wounded, and so it just demonstrates the desperation in terms of identifying additional forces for their military. It's something that will continue to keep a close eye on.' By deploying troops to Ukraine, North Korea may lead South Korea's Yoon Suk Yeol government to rethink its policy of not providing direct military support to Ukraine, a U.S. expert said Thursday. According to South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency, Victor Cha, Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, made the remarks following media reports that the Russian military is organizing the aforementioned special battalion of North Korean personnel amid manpower shortages. 'I would imagine, it would make President Yoon very upset, and who knows what he's going to do if he's really upset?' Cha said at a forum co-hosted by the Asan Institute for Policy Studies and the Brussels-based Center for Security, Diplomacy and Strategy. Reports of N. Korea sending troops to Russia may prompt Yoon to reconsider its support for Ukraine: U.S. expert Yonhap News Agency (@YonhapNews) October 17, 2024 Budanov's statement is another indication of North Korea's growing role in Russia's all-out war on Ukraine and that it seems the size of the troop contingent that will participate has already grown larger than some had originally thought. The Latest On the battlefield, more than two months after Ukraine first launched its invasion of Russia’s Kursk region, one news organization is making a contested claim about the status of that operation. Ukrainian troops have lost about half the territory captured, according to the Telegraph. 'A senior Russian commander from Chechnya said that an estimated 50,000 troops were pushing back Ukrainian forces, who either had to ‘flee or end up in the cauldron,’' the publication reported.

Well-connected Russian and Ukrainian military bloggers have been reporting since Saturday that Moscow’s troops have punched through sectors of Ukraine’s front lines in Kursk, the publication noted. Col.-Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukraine’s Armed Forces, last week confirmed that 50,000 Russians were fighting in Kursk, according to the Ukrainian Suspline news outlet. He stressed, however, that such actions led to the weakening of Russian groups in other areas, in particular in the Zaporizhzhia, Kherson regions and the Kramatorsk direction. 'The situation in the Kursk region remains difficult, but under control,' the Ukrainian DeepState open-source intelligence group said on Telegram last week. 'It was a difficult and tense night, the Defense Forces of Ukraine are indeed carrying out stabilization actions, but it has not yet been possible to regain control over everything that was lost.' Russians have 'suffered considerable losses during the assault, so it will be difficult for them to gain a foothold,' DeepState added. 'The worst is now, probably, in Lyubimovka, but we have to wait for the end of the new round of maneuver warfare.' Ryder on Thursday pushed back on the assessment that Russia has recaptured about half the territory it lost in Kursk. 'Based on the information I have, that is not accurate,' he told The War Zone. 'There has been a small amount of territory retaken by the Russians in Kursk, but at this stage, nothing that we would consider significant.' DeepState'a interactive battle map shows that Ukraine has lost territory in Kursk in the past few weeks, mostly in the northwestern sector of its salient. However, it does not appear to be as much as The Telegraph asserted. The gray shows the position of Ukrainian troops in Kursk on Sept. 21. (DeepState) Much of that territory has been recaptured by Russia as of Oct. 16, according to DeepState (DeepState) Some Russian milbloggers meanwhile have reported a slowdown in the effort to repel Ukrainian forces. Some Russian channels report a slowdown in efforts to repel an 'attempted invasion' in the Kursk region.

He made those comments Thursday during a press conference in Brussels, after presenting his 'Victory Plan' to European Union leaders. 'Either Ukraine will have nuclear weapons, which will serve as protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance,' he said he told the former U.S. president and current Republican presidential nominee, according to the Kyiv Independent. 'Apart from NATO, we do not know of such an effective alliance.' 'I believe Trump heard me and said that it was a fair argument,' he added. Zelensky also invoked the Budapest Memorandum, in which Ukraine agreed in 1994 to give up its nuclear arsenal in exchange for security guarantees from Russia, the U.S., and the U.K., the publication noted. 'The agreement resulted in Ukraine losing its nuclear shield, Zelensky argued, while other powers that have maintained their nuclear arsenal have not suffered from a full-scale war,' according to the Kyiv Independent. Zelensky emphasized that he would choose NATO membership over pursuing nuclear weapons. Zelensky spoke to Trump and said:'There are two choices.

The group, UAT-5647, also known as RomCom, 'has long been considered a multi-motivational threat actor performing both ransomware and espionage-oriented attacks,' the report states. 'However, UAT-5647 has accelerated their attacks in recent months with a clear focus on establishing long–term access for exfiltrating data of strategic interest to them. Our assessment, in line with recent reporting from CERT-UA and Palo Alto Networks, indicates that the threat actor is aggressively expanding their tooling and infrastructure to support a wide variety of malware components authored in diverse languages and platforms such as GoLang, C++, The RUST and LUA.' The cyber attack on high-profile Ukrainian entities is likely part of a two-pronged effort to steal data and place malware on these systems in order to disrupt and seek financial gain from the targets, the report concluded. 'It is also likely that Polish entities were also targeted, based on the keyboard language checks performed by the malware. In another cyber attack Russian hackers used Telegram to target the devices of Ukraine’s draft-aged men with the MeduzaStealer malware, Ukraine’s government computer emergency team stated in a separate report. MeduzaStealer 'was previously used by Russia-linked threat actors to obtain login credentials, computer information, browsing history and data from password managers,' according to The Record. 'Last year, a threat actor known as UAC-0050 deployed the malware against targets in Ukraine and Poland.'

Army Confirms It’s Exploring Requirements For A New Heavy-Lift He...	The U.S. Army is actively exploring options for a new-generation heavy-lift rotorcraft to replace the CH-47 Chinook. Although plans are still very much in their infancy, they have broader implications for future heavy-lift capabilities, especially for the Pacific theater. Confirmation that work on a Chinook successor is ongoing comes as the service progresses with its Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) tiltrotor, which will replace part of the UH-60 Black Hawk fleet, and after its cancelation of the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA), which would have partially replaced the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior armed scout helicopter, now retired without any plans for a direct successor. In response to a question from TWZ, Brig. Gen. Cain Baker, the director of the Future Vertical Lift Cross-Functional Team, or FVL CFT, at Army Futures Command, provided an update on Chinook replacement plans at the Association of the U.S. Army’s annual symposium yesterday. Within the Army, this is known as Capability Set, or 'Cape Set,' Four, part of the wider Future Vertical Lift (FVL) effort. FLRAA and FARA were responses to other FVL Capability Sets. Cap Set 4 also evolved in part from earlier efforts, including the Joint Heavy Lift (JHL) and Joint Multi-Role (JMR) programs. Future Vertical Lift Cross-Functional Team Director Brig. Gen. Cain Baker (center) at the 2024 iteration of the Experimental Demonstration Gateway Event (EDGE) at Yima Proving Ground earlier this year. Mark Schauer/U.S. Army It is important to note that Cape Set Four is not new and the Army announced the start of a new study into a potential Chinook replacement last year. 'We’ve done some initial studies on what a Cape Set Four looks like,' Brig. Gen. Baker explained. 'Those studies are still ongoing, very, very cognizant of the size of it, the type of lift capabilities we want from it, but also the affordability of that.' For Baker, Cape Set Four is very much a lower priority than FLRAA, which is anticipated to enter low-rate initial production in 2028 after which units will start to use them operationally in 2030. Concept artwork of the U.S. Army’s Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) tiltrotor. Bell Textron Bell Baker continued: 'We will start looking eventually at Cape Set Four, as we get the feedback on what we see out in industry that’s available, and then, more importantly, does it potentially meet the requirements that we think we need.' Of those requirements, Baker listed longer range, heavier payload, and fuel efficiency. While Baker admitted that there is still 'a lot of work to do on Cape Set Four,' he also made clear that 'it is definitely out there on the horizon that we’ve got to look at.' In the meantime, the Army's Chinook fleet — which numbers more than 470 aircraft — will soldier on as the service's heavy-lift rotorcraft for many more years to come. This could be aided by the latest Chinook Block II upgrade program. This includes new rotor blades, a revised fuel tank configuration, and other improvements, while there is also a separate option to add more powerful General Electric T408 engines. So far, however, the Army has only bought them for its special operations units. The first picture of a CH-47, tail number 067, with the new T408 engines, which emerged in late 2019. U.S. Army 'We’re going to ride the Chinook like we’re riding the C-130' added Maj. Gen. Clair Gill, Commanding General at the U.S. Army Aviation Center of Excellence and Fort Novosel, also speaking at AUSA and referencing the Air Force’s long-lived turboprop transport plane. Nevertheless, the Army's determination to field a Chinook replacement at some point in the future is a notable turnaround, compared with previous comments. 'There is no plan right now for a Cape Set Four or Five and the Army has been pretty consistent in saying that' Gen. John Murray, then the commanding general of Army Futures Command, declared in May 2021. 'The FARA — Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft — and the Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft are the two plans, [or] programs, we have working right now. There is nothing working for a replacement for the CH-47.' The first Raider X competitive prototype for the now-canceled FARA program in a hangar at Sikorsky’s West Palm Beach, Florida, facility. Sikorsky The first Raider X competitive prototype in a hanger at Sikorsky’s West Palm Beach, Florida, facility. Sikorsky Photo While that plan has now changed, it’s likely that the current focus on FLRAA has highlighted the demand for greater speed and range in the vertical-lift domain, especially in the Pacific scenario. The Army is already preparing for the step-change in vertical-lift capability that the FLRAA promises to bring. This will include a new ability to conduct Large-Scale, Long-Range Air Assault, or L2A2, operations, defined by the ability to 'deliver one Brigade Combat Team in one period of darkness, over 500 miles, arriving behind enemy lines, and be able to conduct sustained combat operations,' Maj. Gen. Brett Sylvia, head of the 101st Airborne Division, said during a separate talk at AUSA. L2A2 currently relies upon a fast-flying tiltrotor to be realized, with the specific range and speed advantage of Bell’s V-280 Valor demonstrator very likely being a major factor behind its choice for FLRAA instead of Boeing’s rival SB>1 Defiant. FLRAA is derived from the V-280 design. How this does or doesn’t translate to a heavy-lift rotorcraft is an open question. There is no tiltrotor in this category currently flying or in development — although the idea has certainly been raised in the past — leaving a dearth of any kind of platform that can fulfill the Army’s Cape Set Four requirements. A concept from the Karem Aircraft Company shows a future heavy-lift tiltrotor, in the C-130 size category, schemed for the previous Joint Heavy Lift program, which also fed into Future Vertical Lift. Karem Aircraft Company rendering While the structural and performance enhancements introduced in the Chinook Block II program add speed and lift to an airframe design that’s now over 60 years old, the helicopter offers nothing close to FLRAA levels of performance. At the same time, Chinook Block II has always been seen as a stopgap until a replacement platform can be defined, a conundrum Cape Set Four is now grappling with. Other than the Chinook, the only other suitable heavy-lift rotorcraft currently in production is the CH-53K King Stallion, as operated by the U.S. Marine Corps.

Meshaq Hylton This program has been anything but trouble-free, with issues during its development prompting a demand from Congress that the Marines examine potential alternatives, such as the Chinook. On top of the Chinook Block II, another potential stopgap solution for the Army would be to re-engine its CH-47 fleet with T408 engines. This would provide a significantly more capable helicopter, building on its speed, payload, and hot-and-high performance. The T408s engines each produce 7,500 shaft horsepower (shp), around 2,500 shp more than the T55-GA-714As on standard CH-47F models. In the past, the Army’s reluctance to re-engine its Chinooks — and to buy Block IIs for regular Army units — seemed to be driven, at least in part, by a stated desire to move beyond the venerable design and instead look toward fielding a new heavy-lift rotary-wing aircraft, something that has previously attracted pushback from Congress.

Thomas Mort However, for some years now, there’s been a growing realization that today’s Chinook is not survivable enough in some scenarios for potential future conflicts with peer or near-peer adversaries. 'We needed a capability that could fly great distances at great speeds and penetrate, let’s say, a Russian air defense system,' Army Secretary Mark Esper told members of the House Appropriations Committee's defense subcommittee, back in 2019, defending Army plans to shift funds from the Chinook to future aircraft programs and modernization programs. 'The decision, I think, for the CH-47s for the conventional Army — what probably changed was, when the National Defense Strategy was issued, it told us to move away from counterinsurgency to high-intensity conflict,' Esper added.

U.S. Army photo by Markus Rauchenberger That means switching to advanced aircraft like the FLRAA tiltrotor and — until its cancelation — FARA, which emphasize high speed and long range as well as other measures to enhance their over survivability. The survivability question, in general, is one that has consistently been raised about rotorcraft of all types, especially when it comes to future high-end fights. In the meantime, the dense air defense environment faced by tactical aircraft — including rotorcraft — in Ukraine has demonstrated the vulnerability of traditional platforms even when exposed to older-generation threats. Along with concerns over rotorcraft survivability is the interest expressed by the Army (as well as the Marine Corps and Air Force) in distributed logistics chains, leveraging, at least in part, increasingly large uncrewed aerial cargo platforms. This could also raise questions about whether a new heavy-lift platform is necessary or cost-effective. A video showing the Kaman KARGO drone, one of the uncrewed aerial cargo designs the Marine Corps is currently considering acquiring. Another uncrewed option for future heavy-lift, vertical-lift requirements might be found in a fan-in-wing vertical take-off-and-landing capable type. Earlier this month, we reported on how Aurora Flight Sciences is working on a demonstrator aircraft in this category, as well as a scaled-up cargo aircraft based on the same technology. The demonstrator is being developed under a U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) program and reflects Air Force interest in a new high-speed, runway-independent special operations transport plane. If this concept actually comes to fruition and is operationally viable, it would provide a C-130-like payload with VTOL capability, and, even though it likely would not be procured by the Army, it could assume aspects of the mission set for the service. An Aurora Flight Sciences rendering of an uncrewed fan-in-wing VTOL-capable cargo aircraft. Aurora Flight Sciences Looking further ahead, the need for higher-performance vertical lift could potentially be provided by some kind of High-Speed Vertical Take-Off and Landing, or HSVTOL, aircraft. This is a concept that Bell is meanwhile has been working on, including now as part of the same DARPA program that Aurora's lift fan design is under development for. While this kind of aircraft promises to combine the ability to take off and land vertically using rotors as well as fly at jet speeds in forward flight, it is still very much in its infancy and significant hurdles — especially as regards the nature of the propulsion system — still need to be overcome. Bell’s latest three HSVTOL concepts are progressively larger, beginning with the smallest, known as HSVTOL Light, which is unmanned and scaling up to a roughly C-130-size transport. Bell The experience with FARA demonstrates just how quickly Army requirements can change and be superseded. With upgrades to ensure it remains relevant, the Chinook will be at the center of Army airlift for decades to come, but service officials are now talking openly about the need for a successor, even if that might not emerge until around the 2060s. With very few options, beyond more Chinooks, which don’t appear to meet long-term requirements, an all-new design currently looks almost certain. Rachel S. Cohen contributed to this story.

Secretive Phoenix Ghost Kamikaze Drones Rushed To Ukraine Finally...	The secretive Phoenix Ghost kamikaze drone, first developed for the U.S. Air Force and supplied to Ukraine in its ongoing fight against Russia, has finally emerged publicly. We now know for sure that Phoenix Ghost is not a single design, but a family of increasingly larger and longer-ranged one-way attack munitions from AEVEX Aerospace, some of which have been seen before, while at least one was only revealed this week. AEVEX confirmed the connection between various kamikaze drones it offers and the Phoenix Ghost effort at the Association of the U.S. Army’s (AUSA) main annual symposium in Washington, D.C., this week. The Pentagon first announced Phoenix Ghost kamikaze drones provided by AEVEX would be headed to Ukraine back in 2022, but scant information about them had subsequently emerged before now. Disruptor, one of the AEVEX kamikaze drones now known to be part of the Phoenix Ghost family. Jamie Hunter 'It’s been a long time coming,' Elizabeth Trammell, senior director of business development at AEVEX, told TWZ Tuesday. 'This has been around for a while … We’ve been able to receive specific permission to talk about it.' The Phoenix Ghost family of one-way attack munitions includes types with distinctly different forms and performance capabilities. At least some of the designs were derived from aerial targets that AEVEX originally developed for testing counter-drone systems, according to the company. Phoenix Ghosts were among the first kamikaze drones the U.S. military publicly announced it would be sending to Ukraine, but it had not been previously confirmed what they were and no conclusive imagery showing one had emerged before now. It is worth noting that the development of the Phoenix Ghost family, which traces back to a project under the Air Force's Big Safari special projects office, also predates Russia's all-out invasion of Ukraine in 2022. As such, AEVEX was very much ahead in the United States in working on one-way-attack drones, in general. I find it odd that with all the imagery and video pouring out of Ukraine of virtually every weapon system before, action, in action, or after action, we have yet to see a single confirmed image of a Phoenix Ghost suicide drone/loitering munition.&mdash; Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) July 25, 2022 All 'AEVEX loitering munitions use visual-based navigation to autonomously identify and follow landmarks or features in their environment, enabling precise positioning and pathfinding without reliance on GPS,' according to the company's website. 'Our systems leverage alternative PNT [precision navigation and timing] solutions to maintain precise navigation and operational capability in GPS-denied or degraded environments.' In addition, 'AEVEX loitering munitions automatically detect, identify, locate, report (DILR) and deliver lethal and non-lethal effects against threats across multiple scenarios and domains with unprecedented accuracy and speed' and are able to 'navigate, make decisions, and complete missions without direct intervention,' the company says. However, the drones can also be fitted with line-of-sight links and/or mesh networked radios, as well as electro-optical and infrared sensors, to provide some degree of direct control. In addition to acting as kamikaze drones, AEVEX says the uncrewed aerial systems in its product line can be configured for electronic and cyber warfare and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Among the specific kamikaze drones AEVEX has now disclosed as being part of the Phoenix Ghost family are Dominator and Disruptor, which are in the so-called Group 3 category. The U.S. military defines Group 3 drones as weighing between 55 and 1,320 pounds, being able to fly at altitudes between 3,500 and 18,000 feet, and having top speeds of between 100 and 250 knots. While the Dominator was previously disclosed, Disruptor was only publicly unveiled this week. Disruptor, which has a tubular carbon fiber main body, a pair of straight main wings, and a v-tail configuration, is 10.1 feet long and has a wingspan of 15.75 feet. It has a maximum takeoff weight of 185 pounds when launched pneumatically, but this can be increased to 205 pounds by using a rocket-assisted launch method. AEVEX also states that the Disruptor can be vehicle-launched, but has not provided any further details. Powered by a small internal combustion engine driving a two-bladed pusher propeller, Disruptor can stay aloft for 4.5 hours and fly out to a maximum range of at least 372 miles (598 kilometers) with a 50-pound payload. The company also offers a version using electronic fuel injection (EFI), increasing its endurance to 11.6 hours and extending its range out to 822 miles (1,322 kilometers). Disruptor's engine and propeller. Jamie Hunter Disruptor is interestingly similar, at least in very broad strokes, to kamikaze drones that Iran has developed or helped its proxies develop, such as the Shahed 101. AEVEX says the Group 3 Dominator is dimensionally identical to Disruptor in terms of overall length and wingspan, but it has a completely different twin-boom configuration with an inverted v-shaped tailplane. This a very common configuration for drones in this general size class, with the RQ-7 Shadow, which the U.S. Army announced plans to retire in Febraury, being just one example. There is also the Aerosonde family, versions of which remain in service with the U.S. special operations community. Other twin boom drones with v-shaped and straight tailplanes, including ones made in China, are also in widespread use globally. The Dominator drone. AEVEX Dominator has maximum takeoff weights of 205 and 225 pounds when launched pneumatically or in a rocket-assisted mode, respectively. With a similar, if not identical propulsion system to Disruptor, Dominator has maximum endurances of 4.6 and 11.7 hours and ranges of 293 and 743 miles (492 and 1,196 kilometers) with and without EFI. A Dominator drone on a pneumatic launcher. AEVEX The Phoenix Ghost family also includes a smaller Group 2 drone called Atlas, another design that AEVEX has previously shown publicly. Per the U.S. military definitions, uncrewed aerial systems in this category weigh between 21 and 55 pounds, can fly at altitudes up to 3,500 feet, and attain top speeds of up to 250 knots. The Atlas, which has what looks to be pop-out main wings and v-tail, has a maximum takeoff weight of 20.9 pounds, including an 8.1-pound payload, and is 2.9 feet long and has a wingspan of 5.5 feet, per AEVEX's website. Its stated endurance is between one and two hours, with a maximum range of at least 74 miles (120 kilometers). How Atlas is powered is not immediately clear, but it has a pusher propeller at the rear. The Atlas drone. AEVEX At AUSA this week, AEVEX had a product card detailing another drone called Dagger, which also does not appear to have been previously disclosed and looks to be a Group 2 analog to Disruptor. It is unclear whether the electrically powered Dagger is technically part of the Phoenix Ghost family or is a design that followed on from that work. Dagger is six feet long and has a wingspan of 8.7 feet, has a maximum takeoff weight of 35 pounds (including an eight-pound payload), and can fly for up to 80 minutes and out to a range of 120 miles (193 kilometers). A picture of the rendering of the Dagger drone seen on the AEVEX product card at AUSA. Jamie Hunter Dagger is designed to make it easier for troops to 'move in, get out, set up, shoot off, and … get out of there,' AEVEX's Trammell explained to TWZ at AUSA. AEVEX's Trammel also said that the Phoenix Ghost family encompasses multiple other assets that the company is keeping under wraps for now. The company is also continuing to evolve its product line, in part based on experiences from the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. AEVEX uses a two-week design cycle to let the company quickly respond to new threats and conditions troops encounter on the ground. 'We've learned a lot,' Trammell said. 'This [Distruptor] does not look anywhere near what it was when we first put it out.' The nose cone has changed, she said, as has the color. She indicated the colors have evolved to better camouflage the weapons around the clock. Ukrainian officials notably began highlighting Russia's use of black or otherwise darkly painted kamikaze drones, and that this had made it difficult to visually spot and track them, especially at night, last year. Ukraine has since been observed employing kamikaze drones with similar paint schemes. Another view of the Disruptor drone on the floor of this year's AUSA show, highlighting its dark paint job. Jamie Hunter As the war in Ukraine grinds through its third year, Trammell also expects demand will grow for the drones to collect more intelligence and play a larger role in electronic warfare. AEVEX is also known to be looking at enhancing Phoenix Ghost’s resistance to GPS jamming, something that has been a significant problem in Ukraine, for both drones and guided munitions. The company says its acquisition of Veth Research Associates should see that company’s guidance and navigation technology inserted into Phoenix Ghost drones, according to Aviation Week. When it comes to Ukraine, it remains unclear what types of Phoenix Ghost drones the country has received to date and how they are specifically configured in terms of payloads and guidance capabilities. To date, the U.S. military has pledged at least 1,800 Phoenix Ghosts to Ukraine. The U.S. military said had obligated approximately $576 million for the purchase of drones in this family from AEVEX for the Ukrainian armed forces through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI), as of August. AEVEX was shipping around 230 loitering munitions each month at the height of its deliveries, and is still delivering fresh weapons every two weeks, Trammell told TWZ. Back in April 2022, then-top Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby did say that the Phoenix Ghost drones Ukraine was getting had similar, 'but not [the] exact,' capabilities as the AeroVironment Switchblade 300 tube-launched loitering munition, which could point to the smaller Atlas or Dagger. However, officials added at that time that there are differences 'in the scope of capability for the Phoenix Ghost.' Another view of the Atlas drone. AEVEX Kirby's statement is one of a number of signs that had emerged before this year's AUSA gathering pointing to Phoenix Ghost actually being a family of drones and that Ukraine had received multiple types, something David Hambling just explored in more detail for Forbes last month. 'It’s a system of systems that varies in range and payload and type,' Skip Arny, a Vice President at Aevex Aerospace, also said about Phoenix Ghost at the AUSA show in 2022, according to Defense News. 'It’s a great example of a quick-reaction capability, and we basically got a request to put a system together, and that’s what it is.' Just this summer, pictures also began to emerge of a drone design that had not been previously observed in use by Ukraine, which independent defense analyst H.I. Sutton noted on his website Covert Shores looked similar if not identical to the AEVEX Dominator. Questions have been raised about whether these drones are actually Dominators or are a local derivative or clone of some kind given that they were reportedly recovered in Russia. The U.S. government has, at least from what is known publicly to date, placed significant restrictions on the use of American-supplied munitions against targets inside Russian territory, but various exceptions and caveats are also known to exist. Drones can stray from their intended flight paths for various reasons, too. Ukraine's arsenal of longer-range kamikaze drones has otherwise steadily expanded in the past two years, predominantly through the fielding of new domestically developed types. The wreckage of a one-way attack drone — which looks to be the Dominator, or a derivative of it — used to attack Russia earlier this year. via X Not knowing what kinds of Phoenix Ghost drones Ukraine has or how they are configured, it is also unclear what kinds of target sets the drones are being employed against. 'We haven’t really gotten into anti-tank or anti-armor, just because it’s not been a requirement for us,' AEVEX's senior director of business development Trammell told TWZ at AUSA this week. 'A lot of our aircraft, we had the base capability and then our customers came in and said, ‘This is what we want.’' Trammell's mention of 'customers' plural also raises questions about who else may have received Phoenix Ghost drones. As of June, AEVEX had reportedly delivered 4,000 drones under U.S. military contracts, well beyond the 1,800 Phoenix Ghosts publicly committed to Ukraine through USAI. It is certainly possible that the Ukrainian military has received more Phoenix Ghosts than is publicly known, but demand for various tiers of kamikaze drones is also growing globally. Earlier this year, the U.S. government approved the potential sale of more than 1,000 kamikaze drones, a mix of Switchblade 300 and ALTIUS 600M types, to Taiwan. That comes amid broader U.S. military plans to help the island turn the airspace and waters around it into a 'hellscape' full of uncrewed platforms in the event of an invasion from the mainland, as you can read more about here. The now routine use of multiple tiers of kamikaze drones in the conflict in Ukraine has helped push the Taiwan 'hellscape' plans forward and is also driving efforts across the U.S. military to acquire and field these types of uncrewed aerial systems. Last year, the Pentagon kicked off an initiative dubbed Replicator specifically with the goal of helping get thousands of new and relatively cheap uncrewed platforms with high degrees of autonomy into the hands of U.S. forces across all domains by 2025. In August, the Army awarded an especially massive contract valued at nearly $1 billion to AeroVironment for Switchblade 300 and 600-series drones, which is now the subject of a formal protest. 'There are a lot of companies in this space, so Switchblades are one of our first efforts here, but it's not going to be our last or our only one,' Doug Bush, the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology, told TWZ and other outlets at a media roundtable on the sidelines of the AUSA conference this week. 'I think you will see soon a diversity of companies getting contracts for that kind capability. It's a really healthy part of industry. We don't have, like, just one place to go.' Each branch of the U.S. armed forces — particularly the Army and Air Force — has been interested 'in some way, shape or form' in AEVEX's product line, Trammell told TWZ. Furthermore, 'as the conflict [in Ukraine] dwindles, there's other opportunities that this can go for,' she said. 'There's a lot of big programs that are looking for midsize UAS systems, and we're trying to advertise to that.' Still, the experience AEVEX has now gained from working on the now less-secretive Phoenix Ghost effort for Ukraine could give the company an important leg up as kamikaze drones continue to make their mark worldwide.

B-2 Spirits Just Sent A Very Ominous Message To Iran	The Pentagon is stating that B-2 Spirit stealth bombers, along with other U.S. forces, conducted a strike on Houthi underground weapon storage sites in Yemen. This it the first operational strike mission for the Spirit in years and the first into Yemen. It sends a very specific and powerful message that only B-2 can to the Houthi's benefactor, Iran. It also occurred on what appears to be the precipice of an unprecedented Israeli retaliation strike. As to why the B-2 was used against the Houthis, who have only rudimentary air defenses, we will address in a moment, but it was by design a very ominous and potentially historic act that might have featured the first use of an incredibly rare weapon. Even if it did not, the message was the same. The Pentagon's statement reads: 'Today, U.S. military forces, including U.S. Air Force B-2 bombers, conducted precision strikes against five hardened underground weapons storage locations in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. U.S. forces targeted several of the Houthis' underground facilities housing various weapons components of types that the Houthis have used to target civilian and military vessels throughout the region. This was a unique demonstration of the United States' ability to target facilities that our adversaries seek to keep out of reach, no matter how deeply buried underground, hardened, or fortified. The employment of U.S. Air Force B-2 Spirit long-range stealth bombers demonstrate U.S. global strike capabilities to take action against these targets when necessary, anytime, anywhere. For over a year, the Iran-backed Houthis, Specially Designated Global Terrorists, have recklessly and unlawfully attacked U.S. and international vessels transiting the Red Sea, the Bab Al-Mandeb Strait, and the Gulf of Aden. The Houthis' illegal attacks continue to disrupt the free flow of international commerce, threaten environmental catastrophe, and put innocent civilian lives and U.S. and partner forces' lives at risk. At the direction of President Biden, I authorized these targeted strikes to further degrade the Houthis' capability to continue their destabilizing behavior and to protect and defend U.S. forces and personnel in one of the world's most critical waterways. Again, the United States will not hesitate to take action to defend American lives and assets; to deter attacks against civilians and our regional partners; and to protect freedom of navigation and increase the safety and security in these waterways for U.S., coalition, and merchant vessels. We will continue to make clear to the Houthis that there will be consequences for their illegal and reckless attacks. I am grateful for the professionalism and skill of the brave American troops who took part in today's actions and who continue to stand guard in defense of our Nation.' The DoD's description of the targets is very important. 'Hardened underground weapons storage locations,' followed by declaring 'the United States' ability to target facilities that our adversaries seek to keep out of reach, no matter how deeply buried underground, hardened, or fortified.' This directly highlights the B-2's special ability to carry out unique penetrating 'bunker buster' strikes, specifically via its ability to carry the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, better known as the MOP. Although it isn't clear if this weapon was used, it's certainly possible for a number of reasons, and that is really all that matters. The MOP, weighing in around 30,000lbs, can only be carried by the B-2. Two can be lugged aloft by each of the stealth bombers at a time. These are highly specialized and prized weapons only available in relatively tiny numbers. MOP is able to penetrate deeper than any other conventional bomb on earth and is specifically designed and has been repeatedly upgraded to go after deeply buried, high-value targets, especially those in Iran. These sites include command and control centers and missile storage and launch facilities, as well as aircraft storage areas, tunneled into mountains. But above all else, the MOP's top targets would be extremely hardened sites related to Iran's nuclear program. This is a reality we have been discussing for many years and in detail. Even with the MOP, they will be a challenge to destroy, but anything short of a nuclear weapon, ground invasion, or use of an 'exotic' tactic like irradiation, the MOPs have the best shot at severely damaging these facilities and degrading their utility over the long term. Iran's Natanz nuclear site burrowed in a mountain.(PHOTO © 2023 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION) The Houthis also have high-value sites dug into mountains. They are not nearly as advanced as those found in Iran, and while hitting weak points, support areas, and entrances may degrade their utility, truly destroying them may very well necessitate the MOP's special penetrating abilities. Even if the target set didn't require it, a demonstration of MOP's capabilities — if it was indeed used — may have been a strategic messaging decision, but more about that in a moment. The Houthis are going underground. In 2019, the movement seems to have reactivated a Saleh-era underground facility at Hafa military base in Sanaa, which had been destroyed by coalition airstrikes back in 2015. (15.325075° 44.239581°) pic.twitter.com/g4Ep5CltEX&mdash; Fabian Hinz (@fab_hinz) March 14, 2021 The timing of such a strike makes perfect sense as it happened just as the tension between Israel and Iran is about to hit uncharted territory as the world awaits what is by all indications going to be a significant strike by Israel directly on Iran. Sending a very direct reminder that the U.S. has the ability to destroy extremely hardened sites with conventional weapons and it is willing to use them seems right on cue in terms of deterrence theater. This is only magnified if MOP was indeed used for the first time. In fact, MOP-related news often peculiarly pops-up during times of escalation with America's 'rogue state' foes, although a demonstration of operational use has never occurred. Regardless, striking these sites with any munitions also degrades the Houthi's long-range capabilities ahead of an Israeli operation, which is important. The B-2 also has the ability to deliver Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) with penetrating warheads in the 2,000-pound class (BLU-109), as well as, at least in the past, 5,000-pound class bunker busters, the latter being a much rarer weapon the exact status of which in the B-2's inventory is unclear. You can read more about this class of weapon's origins here and murky status here. A very early graphic from the MOP program showing the bomb able to penetrate up to 60 feet under the ground. By 2007, the weapon was reportedly capable of burrowing nearly four times deeper than this. This also offers a comparison between the 2,000lb BLU-109-equipped guided bomb and 5,000lb GBU-28. DOD via GlobalSecurity.org The B-2 is capable of carrying 16 of the 2,000lb class weapons, allowing it to 'dig down' through hardened targets that do not necessitate a MOP by having one weapon follow through the hole made by the one that just struck before it and so on. It is creative 'weaponeering' that allows for lesser bunker busters to achieve greater burrowing effects. Even the MOP could use this tactic for striking very deeply buried targets, like some of those in Iran. Otherwise disabling sites by going after entrance tunnels and other weaker, but less centralized areas may be an option. GBU-31 JDAMs equipped with BLU-109 penetrator warheads. (USAF) But if common 2,000lb bunker busters were used, why leverage the B-2, a precious asset of which only 19 exist, on targets that sit under airspace that is barely defended? There are a number of reasons for this that we already addressed after the Spirit was selected to strike targets in Libya in 2017. You can read that post here. But once again, the messaging related to the B-2 and its ability to penetrate deep into contested airspace to deliver a highly specialized weapon that threatens Iran's most guarded military and nuclear assets is the most glaring reason. We will have to wait to find out exactly what was stuck and how, but as it sits now, this mission was far more than just an attack operation to achieve a kinetic effect. It was meant to send a blindingly bright message to Iran at a critically high-risk and pivotal moment.

Command Center Stryker Teamed With Uncrewed Ground Vehicle ‘Wingm...	General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) unveiled a new Mission Command On The Move (MCOTM) concept and its supporting hardware at the Association of the United States Army's biggest annual conference (AUSA '24), which wrapped up today outside of Washington, D.C. The idea is to take an advanced command center filled with communications and a crew that can interpret critical data and make fast decisions, pack it all into a nimble armored vehicle, and push it forward toward the edge of battle along with an array of uncrewed ground vehicles (UGVs) also under its control. This concept appears to aim to accomplish a couple of key objectives. First, it makes a command and control node more nimble, protected, and thus far more survivable on a modern battlefield. Fixed command centers, which often have a major footprint and the multi-spectral signatures that go with it, are more vulnerable than ever, especially as precision-guided missile and drone technology proliferate at an alarming space. So allowing it to reposition rapidly, and even keep up with the forces it supports, is seen as an attractive capability. There is also a major logistics burden when it comes to establishing, breaking down, and repositioning traditional command centers in tents and trailers. The other is to allow this mobile C2 node to also control an array of UGVs that can work in a defensive manner, protecting the command center and friendly forces, and even in an offensive one. Seeing as the C2 node is armored, deeply networked, and highly mobile, it could stay in relatively close proximity to at least some of the UGVs it controls, allowing for line-of-sight connectivity between them. The UGVs can provide direct fire, reconnaissance, air defense, and additional transport capabilities. This kind of manned-unmanned teaming armored ecosystem is very much the direction the Army is interested in heading in the coming years. Central to this concept is the 8&#215;8 Mission Command On The Move (MCOTM) armored vehicle, which is based on the StrykerX demonstrator. This rolling battlefield management node works as a forward brain for friendly forces and a quarterback for the aforementioned UGVs even in hotly contested areas. The General Dynamics Land Systems Stryker Mission Command On The Move (MCOTM) command vehicle. (General Dynamics Land Systems) Like the StrykerX, which was unveiled at the AUSA show in 2022, the Stryker MCOTM system features hybrid-electric propulsion. This also builds on a previous StrykerQB concept that was rolled out for AUSA conference last year. Painted like a football uniform, it was displayed to show the Army 'the 'art of the possible' when it comes to using existing platforms for manned-unmanned teaming, or human-machine integration,' Breaking Defense reported at the time. The earlier StrykerQB vehicle. (General Dynamics Land Systems) The new Stryker MCOTM is another step forward in that development. With increased interior space thanks to a raised rear roof, it has room for seven soldiers. The command vehicle uses GDLS's KATALYST Next Generation Electronic Architecture (NGEA) to connect all its systems together and provide for ease of upgradability of its hardware and modification of its software. That enables the vehicle to adapt more quickly to changing tactical realities and technologies. The NGEA system offers 'cyber defense, and individual communication devices for end-to-end secure communications, at echelon,' the company states. 'Integrating innovative intra-command post communications helps substantively reduce electromagnetic signatures, enabling the MCOTM command post to 'hide in plain sight.'' Extra attention has been put on reducing the vehicle's signature beyond the radio frequency spectrum, including thermal and acoustic. The vehicle's hybrid propulsion helps with both. For self-protection, the Stryker MCOTM showcased on the showroom floor features the Iron Fist Light active protection system. The system is designed to shoot down approaching anti-tank guided missiles and other infantry anti-armor weapons, and could be used to also swat down incoming kamikaze drones and drone-launched projectiles in the near future. GDLS has shown the Stryker MCOTM paired with the newest version of the company's 8&#215;8 Multi-Utility Tactical Transport (MUTT) robotic vehicle, known as the MUTT XM, and the latest iteration of its TRX Defender, a 10-ton modular tracked robotic vehicle that can be configured to provide ground and air defense fire support. At AUSA this year, GDLS also highlighted MUTT XM as a robot dog carrier vehicle, capable of releasing and retrieving these mechanical and potentially deadly quadrupeds in forward areas. They can also be used for outer security around the MCOTM. At AUSA, the specific robot dog shown together with the MUTT XM was a Ghost Robotics Vision 60 quadrupedal UGV (Q-UGV), a design The War Zone has covered extensively in the past. This particular Vision 60 was carrying MIMIC spoofing technology from General Dynamics Mission Systems, 'providing a deployed layer of protection for the MCOTM command vehicles,' according to the company. A key part of our Mission Command on the Move (MCOTM) concept at AUSA 2024 is the MUTT XM, the newest member of our family of Multi-Utility Tactical Transport robotic vehicles.MUTT XM is bigger, faster and stronger than its predecessors and is hardened against electromagnetic… pic.twitter.com/7MLtXYW0Xm&mdash; General Dynamics Land Systems (@GD_LandSystems) October 15, 2024 The MUTT XM by itself 'is bigger, faster, and stronger than its predecessors and is hardened against electromagnetic interference,' GDLS stated in a release. It 'lightens the load as an equipment-carrying 'robotic mule' but also has built-in flexibility for a wide variety of combat, combat support, and combat service support functions and payloads.'

(Jamie Hunter) The Army has been experimenting with versions of the MUTT vehicle for a while, something we noted in February 2022. In an opposition forces exercise, the 8×8 wheeled, hybrid-electric-powered uncrewed ground vehicles (UGV) were each configured with a Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS) equipped with a 7.62mm M240 machine gun and a Javelin anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) launcher. It also had a tethered quadcopter drone with an array of video cameras allowing it to provide additional surveillance and reconnaissance capacity, as well as act as a signal relay. That extends how far the MUTT can operate from its human operators. You can see one example of that configuration in the image below. An 8&#215;8 Multi-Utility Tactical Transport (MUTT) as seen during a 2022 demonstration. (U.S. Army) TRX, which GDLS had first unveiled at the AUSA gathering in 2020, is a tracked semi-autonomous vehicle with a flat deck that can be configured in numerous ways, including for direct and indirect fire, autonomous resupply, complex obstacle breaching, counter-unmanned aerial systems (C-UAS), electronic warfare (EW), reconnaissance, and other battlefield missions. The core design was developed to meet the Army's need for a 10- to 20-ton UGV. That vehicle was the company’s submission to the Army’s Robotic Combat Vehicle-Medium (RCV-M) competition that Howe & Howe ultimately won with its M5.

(Jamie Hunter) As seen above and below, the TRX on display at AUSA this year was mocked up as a short-range air defense (SHORAD) system with faux Stinger short-range heat-seeking surface-to-air missiles, Coyote anti-drone interceptors, a 30mm automatic cannon, and a 7.62x51mm machine gun. This is an impressive and diverse loadout for a relatively small tracked vehicle. Vehicles that are capable of rebuffing drone attacks, are armored, and can keep up with frontline forces are becoming a growing priority for the U.S. Army and this is clearly a major business growth area for industry. Having just such a vehicle to protect the manned command and control Stryker that could operate detached from forward forces is also key. (Jamie Hunter) Another version of TRX we wrote about in 2021 was set up as a launch platform for 50 AeroVironment Switchblade-series loitering munitions. Such a configuration could venture forward and launch a devastating drone swarm at the command of the MCOTM.

(Joseph Trevithick) www.twz.com The Army is increasingly looking to integrate UGVs with its crewed armored formation on the battlefield. Similar to how the USAF wants its Next Generation Air Dominance manned 'fighter' to be the centerpiece of a family of systems that will be dominated by uncrewed types, working as the central C2 node 'quarterback' for these drones, GDLS is presenting a similar concept for ground operations. Moving the controller forward not only helps with connectivity and awareness, but also allows for deficiencies in autonomy to be overcome by proximity. Advances in autonomy will change those relationships over time, but this kind of on-the-move management will be important at least in the near term as the U.S. military has stressed that having humans at least somewhere 'on-the-loop' is a requisite for uncrewed platforms. As far as the MCOTM's more traditional command and control functions, those are not clear, but even possessing some of these abilities and being able to keep them on the move and forward while flanked by a protective phalanx of UGVs is an enticing concept to ponder. Another view of the Stryker MCOTM on display at this year's AUSA show. Jamie Hunter Regardless of whether this system fills this role for the Army or anyone else, the general concept behind it is something we're going to be seeing more of in the coming years.

Army’s Future Vertical Lift Tiltrotor Will Differ Significantly F...	The U.S. Army's Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) tiltrotor is shaping up to be significantly different from the V-280 Valor from which it is derived. Changes range from the design of the drive train to the fuselage layout to the arrangement of the seats inside the main cabin. The service's goal is to have the initial FLRAA configuration largely nailed down by next year and development work is already informing exploration of how the new aircraft will be used operationally. Army officials provided new details about the FLRAA program at a panel discussion today at the Association of the U.S. Army's (AUSA) main annual conference in Washington, D.C. The service picked Bell and its V-280-based design as the winner of the FLRAA competition in 2022. A so-called Critical Design Review (CDR) is expected to occur next summer ahead of the planned delivery of the first of six FLRAA prototypes in 2026. The program schedule as it exists now sees low-rate initial production of the tiltrotors starting in 2028 and units beginning to use them operationally in 2030. Bell 'To be very clear, and that's why I very rarely use the term V-280 for FLRAA, the name of the aircraft will be different, the nomenclature will be different, the changes are significant,' Army Col. Jeffrey Poquette, the head of the program on the Army side, explained at AUSA. 'The drive train has already been upsized to meet the purposes and intent for meeting our requirements.' In terms of general performance, requirements the Army previously laid out publicly for FLRAA called for a design capable of hitting a top speed of at least 250 knots (285 miles per hour), and potentially up to 280 knots (320 miles per hour), and with an unrefueled combat radius of between 200 and 300 nautical miles. In testing to date, the experimental V-280, which has been flying since 2017, has reached a top speed of over 300 knots. The stated maximum speed and range of a typical current-generation Black Hawk under normal operating conditions is around 163 knots (187.5 miles per hour) and 268 nautical miles, respectively, according to Lockheed Martin, the parent company of the helicopter's manufacturer Sikorsky. The Army has also said in the past that it wants FLRAA to be able to carry 12 passengers, 4,000 pounds, or a mix of both, internally, as well as between 10,000 pounds and 13,100 pounds of additional cargo slung underneath the fuselage. FLRAA is also expected to have the ability to carry munitions and other stores on stub wings just like Black Hawk variants and the exact configuration of sensors, antennas and other systems will need to be finalized, as well. A future special operations-focused subvariant is set to have other specialized features, too, including aerial refueling capability. FLRAA will have other notable internal and external differences compared to the V-280. 'Something as simple as, will we have cockpit doors? The answer is no. But the Valor does,' Col. Poquette added. 'We've already decided that the original [boarding] step [into the main cabin] was a little too narrow.' 'The things that matter to soldiers in the back are not drive trains or engines or rotors. What matters to them [are things like] is my seat comfortable? Does my ruck[sack] have to sit on my toes when I'm trying to get out? Am I going to trip over the guy in front of me?' the FLRAA program head continued. 'So we spend a lot of time early trying to get the insight from the people that matter to us.' Poquette highlighted experimentation utilizing a wooden FLRAA mock-up earlier this year at Wheeler Army Airfield in Hawaii earlier this year that involved personnel from the 25th Infantry Division as having provided key feedback. 'We spent a week out there with them [the members of the 25th Infantry Division], iterating on the two [internal] configurations we wanted to test. We started with one, the one actually that we thought we were going to choose with [regard to] seat configuration,' Poquette said. 'We ran the soldiers through [drills]&#8230; without any combat gear, and then we added weapons, then we added body armor, then we added MOPP gear. We timed them.' MOPP is the U.S. military's suite of Mission Oriented Protective Posture protective gear, which includes gas masks and full body suits designed to help shield soldiers from chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear hazards. MOPP gear is notoriously physically straining to wear, especially in extremely hot and humid environments. A member of the 25th Infantry Division carrying their weapon and other gear exits the FLRAA mockup during testing at Wheeler Army Airfield in Hawaii in September 2024. US Army Spc. Charles Clark 'The people that do this kind of human systems science are technical experts, We measured every soldier with giant human-sized calipers,' Poquette continued. 'We wanted to make sure we could take care of the fifth percentile soldier, the 95th percent percentile soldier. 'We ran it [the tests] at combat speed &#8230; even as the soldiers came out, they ran out, they went into the prone with their weapon, so it was as tactical as we could make it while getting the information that we need,' he added.' 'What we found out is that soldiers really liked the second configuration better,' the FLRAA program chief said. 'Why did they like it? It was more comfortable, it was faster. They weren't tripping over each other.' Work on the internal configuration is not just limited to the arrangements of the passenger seats. There is the matter of where crew chiefs and other crew members will sit, as well as the positioning of weapons for self-defense. As seen below, the mock-ups the Army used in the tests in Hawaii had a crew-operated 7.62x51mm M240H machine gun mounted in a window on the side of the fuselage similar to the arrangement on the service's existing Black Hawks. US Army Spc. Charles Clark Poquette said today that the configuration of the controls and other features in the FLRAA's cockpit will also be different compared to how things are laid out on the V-280. The Army has been conducting other similar testing with units beyond the 25th Infantry Division. Other experimentation to help lay the groundwork for the future fielding of the FLRAA is already well underway, as you can read more about here. A so-called 'virtual prototype' has been helping personnel get a more hands-on look at FLRAA even before the first real aircraft is built. 'A virtual prototype is similar to a simulator, to the average person it is a simulator, but it's a little more fidelity than that,' according to Col. Poquette. 'It really involves using the software that is going to be in the aircraft, coupling that with a model, or what we call a dynamics model, of how the aircraft flies and how it reacts to conditions and inputs.' As can be seen in the picture below from the testing involving the mock-up earlier this in Hawaii, the Army has also been using augmented reality to give personnel a more in-depth experience so they can provide better feedback. US Army Spc. Charles Clark All of the initial FLRAA user testing and experimentation is particularly important given that the FLRAA is set to be the first-ever operational tiltrotor aircraft in the U.S. Army's inventory and is expected to be a major transformational moment in its history. This will require the service's pilots, especially, to learn entirely new skills sets and concepts of operations. 'How do I do an air assault with an aircraft that's going nearly 300 knots? That's something that Army aviators have never done before&#8230; as far as I know. It's a different mindset,' Poquette explained. 'We are helicopter pilots. &#8230; it's [FLRAA] only a helicopter for like takeoff and land. That's the whole point.' 'The Marine Corps does this. The Air Force Special Operations [Command] does. So we spend a lot of time with them on the program,' he continued. 'I know there is a plan to familiarize Army rotary pilots [with tiltrotors]. We have the V-22, the V-22 is a tiltrotor. So I've already started meeting Army aviators who have experience in the V-22. I just hired an experimental test pilot who is qualified in the V-22. So we're starting to build up the familiarity with a technology that the Army is just not really using.' A US Air Force Special Operations Command CV-22 Osprey. USAF A stock picture of a US Air Force CV-22B Osprey. USAF Bell, together with Boeing, developed the V-22 Osprey, which continues to be a controversial aircraft with a complicated track record. This was underscored by a fatal crash last year that led to virtually all of those aircraft being grounded for some three months. Work is still underway to address the root causes of that mishap and get Marine, Navy, and Air Force V-22 fleets back to their prior operational tempos. The V-280 and the FLRAA derived from it are clean-sheet Bell developments that differ greatly from the Osprey, as The War Zone has explored in detail before. The Army has also previously said that it is already looking toward future FLRAA variants with new and improved capabilities. The service has long touted its key demand that FLRAA use a modular open-architecture approach as making it easier to integrate new systems and functionality onto the aircraft in the future, something that officials at AUSA reiterated today. High-fidelity modeling and other digital engineering tools are also being actively employed now to help refine the baseline FLRAA design. The U.S. military continues to put heavy emphasis on digital engineering, especially in helping to avoid potentially costly issues down the road, despite growing internal and external assessments that the value of these techniques has at least been over-hyped. 'One of the things I try to impress upon people is budgets are tight. FLRAA is expensive. It's the largest program in Army history,' Col. Poquette stressed today. 'We can't afford to make a big mistake. &#8230; we can't afford to build the wrong thing. We can't build four or eight prototypes that miss the mark on the thing that's important to the Army.' US Army soldiers 'board' a FLRAA mock-up at Redstone Arsenal in Alabama. US Army Program Executive Office, Aviati As of this year, the estimated total development cost for FLRAA is approximately $652 million, according to the Government Accountability Office. It could ultimately cost the Army around $70 billion to also acquire as many as 2,000 of the tiltrotors and sustain them across decades of expected service life. Tiltotor aircraft development, in general, has historically involved significant risk and FLRAA's ongoing development comes as expected future battlefield realities also continue to evolve. If all goes according to plan now, the Army will have largely finalized all the changes to its future FLRAA tilt-rotors from the V-280 design by the middle of next year, a key step forward toward getting the transformational aircraft into production and operational service.

Leonardo DRS Gives Details On Its Directed-Energy Counter-Drone S...	The War Zone met up with Leonardo DRS’ Ed House and Blue Halo’s Trip Ferguson at the Association of the United States Army’s biggest annual symposium, AUSA ‘24, which is currently underway in Washington, D.C. to get all the details on the new Counter-Uncrewed Aerial Systems Directed Energy (C-UAS DE) Stryker. You can read our initial report on the armored vehicle that is bristling with counter-drone capabilities here, but House and Ferguson put much more color on the canvas for us in terms of exactly what their creation is capable of and where it will sit in a forces’ air defense force structure. Check it out in the video posted at the top of the story. Background: The new C-UAS DE Stryker is armed with a 26-kilowatt version of the LOCUST laser directed energy weapon from BlueHalo, installed on a retractable mount. It’s also equipped with laser-guided 70mm rockets, a 30mm XM914 automatic cannon that fires proximity burst shells, an M240 machine gun, a potent counter-drone electronic warfare suite, radars, electronic surveillance measures, and other sensors and communications gear. Combined, it’s a feature-packed, multi-layer, counter-drone-optimized, short-range air defense battery that can spot, track, and defeat drones — both kinetically and non-kinetically. All of this is packed into a fast-moving armored vehicle that can easily keep up with the troops it is tasked with protecting. The U.S. Army is looking to significantly grow its short-range air defense capabilities in the coming years, especially to counter the ballooning threat from drones, and the service is specifically interested in directed energy options. Leonardo DRS led a team that developed this unique Stryker variant that included seven other partners – BlueHalo, EOS Defense Systems USA, Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems, Arnold Defense, AMPEX, and Digital Systems Engineering. It took this eclectic consortium just eight months from design, build, and test, to culminate in a live fire exercise at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico that resulted in multiple drones being swatted out of the sky. Now, after unveiling their creation at AUSA ‘24, C-UAS DE Stryker is heading to more trials.	https://www.twz.com/sponsored-content/leonardo-drs-gives-details-on-its-directed-energy-counter-drone-stryker	2024-10-16T12:09:16-07:00	https://www.twz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ldrs-ls-stryker-atemrtc-3034-edited-copy.jpg?quality=85
Aerovironment’s New P550 Flies Five Hours On A Charge, Drops Two-...	AeroVironment on Monday unveiled its new drone that can tote weapons and conduct surveillance for up to five hours on a single charge as the company vies for a spot in the Army’s Long-Range Reconnaissance program. The P550, a highly modular battery-powered unmanned aerial system that can take off and land vertically and is able to carry up to 15 pounds of munitions and sensors, made its debut at the Association of the U.S. Army’s annual meeting in Washington. It’s a fresh entrant in a fast-paced competition that looks to improve soldiers’ real-time battlefield awareness at relatively low cost. 'There are things that fly as long, there are things that carry as much, but there's nothing that does both of that … without being fueled in some manner,' Product Line Manager Cris Cornell said Monday. 'There's nothing on the market performing like that in this space.' Soldiers already use small drones like AeroVironment’s hand-launched RQ-11 Raven for battlefield recon. But the LRR program — part of a broader effort to expand the Army’s arsenal of small drones capable of operating at various altitudes and ranges — promises to bring on a new generation of easily transportable drones that can strike targets while relaying combat data back to troops. The reusable P550 builds on the company’s Raven and Puma drones but adds VTOL capability and room for heavier payloads. Measuring about 17 feet wide, 9 feet long and weighing up to 55 pounds, the Group 2 UAS is designed to be a light lift on the battlefield, easy to assemble and simple to operate and upgrade. That wingspan allows the P550 to ferry multiple weapons and sensors at once, in an expansion of capability over AeroVironment’s existing designs. Rachel Cohen/TWZ The war in Ukraine has proven that the U.S. must adopt a strike role for its growing arsenal of small drones to remain lethal and relevant, Cornell said. 'You’ve got to be able to carry stuff — and not just stuff, you’ve got to be able to carry munitions,' Cornell said. The P550 can fly with the GPS-guided Shryke, a munition weighing less than 2.5 pounds developed by L3Harris and Corvid Technologies; Cornell said the company is exploring other options as well. The display at AUSA showed the drone’s fuselage outfitted with a surveillance payload, a signals-intelligence payload and a communications payload to demonstrate its ability to handle multiple missions compared to its predecessors. Rachel Cohen/TWZ Each aircraft can automatically recognize and catagorize targets, freeing up soldiers who would otherwise sift through imagery and other data for hours each day, and transmit that information via data link. It can also save its findings for later in case enemy jamming prevents it from sending the data in real time or for when emissions control is critical to survival. As the data link market has expanded, it’s become more feasible to design a drone that can connect anywhere — unlike the P550’s predecessors and older legacy systems, said Trace Stevenson, AeroVironment’s senior vice president of uncrewed systems. That relies on a modular open systems approach that aims to keep today’s UAS flexible in combat and could stop it from becoming obsolete in a matter of months or a handful of years. AeroVironment in April announced it had partnered with Parry Labs to design the P550’s software and plug-and-play mission systems. 'It's radio-agnostic, payload-agnostic and [ground control station]-agnostic,' Stevenson said. 'We have the common standards that allow the customer to determine what they want to put on the platform. As technology evolves, it'll be able to incorporate any of those … battery packs, payloads, ground control stations going forward.' That’s another lesson learned from Ukraine, Cornell said: '[The battlefield] changes so fast, and you have to have your system set up to be able to adapt to it.' Aerovironment Soldiers don’t need tools to assemble or disassemble the P550; the drone breaks down into three cases that can be tossed on the back of a Joint Light Tactical Vehicle or packed up as part of a larger pallet of equipment. Battalions can be 'up and flying in under 10 minutes and have eyes on top of them out to 40 km-plus range' to scout out a route ahead, watch enemy movement and more, Cornell said. 'We can do searches, map an area, find out where all the targets are, pass those targets to different elements,' he said. Rachel Cohen/TWZ The P550 has already begun flight testing and demonstrations for potential customers. In January 2023, the Army called on industry to offer options for a drone that could vertically take off and land and collect intelligence over nearly 19 miles and at least five hours in flight. The service plans to tap two vendors to mature their designs within the next few months before picking a winner, Stevenson said. Budget documents project it will begin buying the aircraft in fiscal 2027. The Army looks to buy upward of 600 drones for LRR, Cornell said. Soldiers could use a few in tandem to monitor a larger area, but aren’t likely to deploy them in groups of dozens at a time, he added. Officials across the military want to buy legions of drones, large and small, to grow the number of eyes in the sky and multiply their strike capability while sparing fewer dollars to replace a more advanced aircraft if it goes down. Stevenson said the company is preparing to build thousands of P550s each year. The AeroVironment reps declined to answer how much the UAS costs per unit.

Shield AI Looks To Unleash Its Hivemind Autonomy Software On Mult...	Artificial Intelligence (AI) is touching our lives in varying forms every day and that is only set to accelerate. It is also becoming a massive growth sector in the defense industry. It is posited by friends and adversaries alike that whoever can possess AI supremacy will have a huge advantage on tomorrow’s battlefield. Defense contractor Shield AI has established a firm footing at the bleeding edge, using AI-infused cognitive autonomy to enhance military capability. The company has developed its own family of small quadcopters that use its AI algorithms to efficiently sweep buildings for threats, and its larger drone known as V-BAT that can launch vertically, transition to forward flight, and operate as part of an automated swarming team. Shield AI says its autonomy is designed to be sufficiently versatile to be platform agnostic, meaning that it can be scaled and implemented across an infinite number of different platforms, and not just those in its own stable. NATO defines autonomy as a system's ability to function without outside intervention based on acquired knowledge and situational awareness. Within this, there are two main types when it comes to applying AI to military weapon systems: platform and mission autonomy. Platform autonomy focuses on self-management tasks like flight, navigation, and communication, as well as handling functions such as takeoff, landing, and fault detection. Mission autonomy, however, is more advanced, enabling systems to execute complex tasks, make tactical decisions, and seamlessly coordinate with other systems in dynamic environments. Shield AI's V-BAT drone employs Hivemind autonomy. Shield AI The War Zone sat down with Shield AI’s vice president of engineering for Hivemind, Christian Gutierrez, who is in charge of autonomy engineering and Shield AI’s vision of steadily expanding through integration on an increasing variety of military platforms. TWZ: Before we dive into Shield AI’s autonomy, and specifically your Hivemind product, can you outline your background and technical specializations that you bring to Shield AI? Gutierrez: Well, I started my career as an avionics technician in the U.S. Air Force, working on F-117 Nighthawks and then F-16 Vipers that I deployed with to Iraq back in 2005. I also worked command and control, and battle management for NORAD [North American Aerospace Defense Command] in the Homeland defense alert mission. I then joined Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works as an embedded software engineer working on a critical development program for future-generation aircraft and ground systems. That work included a lot of development testing in that realm before I transitioned to human space flight and deep space missions with my work being focused on software and navigation, learning about the hostility of deep space. Then I became the chief of systems engineering for a family of hypersonic missiles. In that role, I led electrical mechanical ordnance propulsion and the whole lifecycle of the systems. That program ran from inception, through capture, design development, and multiple flight tests for many customers including the U.S. Army and the Navy. All of that experience led me to my current role with Shield AI and our vision of deploying our AI [artificial intelligence] solution across a host of platforms and domains. Right now we’re focused on the air segment, but we're already growing and scaling to expand into different domains such as maritime. We see our success in this industry surrounding our ability to develop the capability to suit the varying needs of different warfighters. TWZ: Can you give us your take on the expansion of autonomy in the military space and explain Shield AI’s approach to mission autonomy, and the opportunities this creates. Gutierrez: When I was at Lockheed Martin – as a platform provider – we started touching on the early phases of what we call platform autonomy, so for example, an autopilot with enhanced features. Since that time a clear bifurcation between platform autonomy and mission autonomy has developed. Think of the latter as a valuable blend of a mission planner and a pilot. Shield AI’s Hivemind autonomy can help companies that excel in developing and building platforms to push the envelope through the employment of mission autonomy. There has to be maturity in both the platform and the autonomy so that we can collectively execute this successfully. In terms of challenges, we need alignment and standards to be fully established around autonomy, much like the automotive industry has done. That will allow us to make aligned progress ahead of our adversaries. At a high level, we think there is industry consensus on the split between mission and platform autonomy. We are working with industry partners to promote understanding of where this lies in terms of defining those levels of autonomy. At Shield AI we are sending a strong message around establishing and maintaining stringent industry standards. We know what they are for automotive, and leaders of AI and autonomy, and the world's leading defense contractors, are now working together to define the standards for our industry. Shield AI is focused on building trust with our customers and developing relationships. That is formed around clearly understanding concepts of operations, understanding the operational needs of different theaters, and understanding the limitations of technology that currently exists. Then we can start to help advance those technologies with our technology. Success in the defense industry is relatively straightforward – it’s the ability to develop and deliver for the warfighter. So first you have to understand what it is the warfighter needs. For that, Shield AI has recruited industry experts to help us shape our operational analysis and our understanding of exactly what is needed. It’s then about having the required expertise to take it through development, integration, and testing. We also need to be very direct with how we regulate all of this and ensure we have the right certification and standards in place. TWZ: Could you share examples of mission autonomy in action? Any real-world wins that demonstrate the effectiveness of your autonomy software and how these successes have shaped your strategy? Gutierrez: Mission autonomy is real – this isn’t theory or PowerPoint. Our technical approach is informed by our experiences with Hivemind, which started out in our small Nova quadcopter drones from 2018. This was years before most people had even heard of mission autonomy. Since then we've been scaling up to Group 3 unmanned air vehicles such as V-BAT and we're doing it seamlessly thanks to how we have developed our Hivemind software stack, which was developed from the outset to be extensible and modular. Our software stack is about perception, cognition, and action. We perceive something, we identify it, then we take action. Hivemind runs through our V-BAT unmanned system, and it has been proven in projects such as the X-62A VISTA [Variable-stability In-flight Simulator Test Aircraft] where we were in complete control of maneuvering an F-16 fighter and showcasing that we could go head-to-head with crewed fighters in dogfights. The X-62A VISTA used Hivemind autonomy to fly the aircraft – a modified F-16. Shield AI We've got several flight tests that we are currently running, including showcasing operations in denied environments. That’s exercising our state estimation algorithms – which is about aggregating data from various sensors to establish where the platform is at in terms of state, so the platform can continue its mission. We also recently completed live fly testing with two Kratos MQM-178 Firejets and two crewed chase aircraft. That testing was about proving the ability to operate what we call intelligent mass, that means crewed and uncrewed platforms coming together and breaking apart at will. That was a huge accomplishment in a first-of-its-kind test. The team is extraordinarily excited about that because we are developing and maturing our technology and it's a huge win at the Group 5 unmanned level. You can read more about this here. TWZ: Can you explain how Hivemind can support enhancements in different platforms? Gutierrez: It goes back to that bifurcation of platform autonomy and mission autonomy. In the military aviation world, the platforms have to fly. But they also have to accomplish a mission, and that's where we come in – where our Hivemind autonomy stack can accomplish a mission. For example, military combat platforms typically have a set of sensors and a feed from those sensors. So, they might need to locate a target. We take those inputs and use AI to make decisions. The decisions being made can be as complex as working out a location or finding an object or target. When we talk about our AI in air platforms, the natural immediate thought is that it's a pilot. That’s right in part, because yes, the AI is flying the aircraft, but that is only a very small part of what you're doing. It's actually the mission side of it that's more of a critical area. You're relying on the platform autonomy to fly the aircraft, and the mission autonomy is telling it to bank and maneuver and climb, etc, to achieve the mission objectives. On the VISTA program we were closer to the control part, the stick controls and things like that to actually fly the actual airplane. But that’s not really the environment we are focused on, it’s much more about the mission autonomy. We aren’t building a bespoke solution that only meets the needs of one platform, and we definitely don’t want it to be locked down in that way. We need to offer modularity, the ability to scale across different platforms in any class or group, adaptability, and interoperability. We need to be able to scale across maritime, space, missile defense, you name it, applying government standards of open architecture so we can operate within anybody's environment via a set of tooling. That means you can generate an AI pilot for example, and we can license that tool suite so a customer can either maintain what we generated for them or develop their own AI for whatever segment or platform they have in mind. A platform manufacturer can come to us as world renowned experts in AI and software development and we can work with them to help develop their own solution for their fleet of aircraft. So, we get away from that vendor lock situation by being open and able to integrate on any system or within any business model. We essentially license our software to them and then work as a partner. This way they get full access to the system, and they are able to do some development themselves. The U.S. government really wants to show that suppliers are integrating with a host of industry partners and that you can deliver a product that’s not solely controlled and owned by the prime contractor. A way of doing that is to expose the interfaces to ensure that everyone has access. That's exactly what we do with our solution. Our bread and butter is the underlying algorithms that generate that AI effect, and it can then be customized as required to meet needs and missions. Shield AI recently completed highly-successful tests with its AI embedded in Kratos Firejets. Shield AI TWZ: What are the key factors that differentiate Shield AI from competitors, especially in terms of your technology? Gutierrez: You have reference architecture, which is the pilot. The core reference implementation is the Intellectual Property [IP], which is all the underlying algorithms, then you have the enterprise, that’s the tooling. Our middleware strategy with industry compliance and modular design enables rapid customization. Having middleware allows you to integrate in a host of hardware environments. It doesn't mean you account for all of them, and that’s why we're also investing in our own computer hardware so that we can offer to work in their hardware environment, or we can bring our own computer box. That middleware is critical, and we've invested in it over the years. We can adapt to any platform with any sensor and with any mission with ease, and we can do it ourselves, or we can enable that provider to do it themselves. That's a huge differentiator. We can show a customer how to do one example and then they can take over and continue to execute while we provide support. That approach seems to really resonate with the customer. The goal is to be able to integrate Hivemind into any hardware environment that a platform provider has. If the environment isn't suitable, for example it doesn't have enough compute, or it doesn't have the power, then we can provide our own ‘compute box.’ We can speak whatever protocol the platform might have, be it MIL-STD-1553 or whatever, there's all kinds of protocols on board these platforms. So having a compute box that can speak to many interfaces is hugely important and just the kind of detail that we think through to ensure that it is a low bar to entry with platform providers. We talk a lot about reinforcement learning and the AI technologies and techniques that we use to conduct a mission. How we learn from the mission, adapt it and then redeploy it onto a platform within hours. Then there's the stack of the cognition, perception, and action, which is tied to our task and behavior model which mimics human behavior. With the VISTA tests, and what we have just seen with Firejet, we are leaps ahead of everyone else. With Firejet, the customer said that was the best flight performance they’d seen. The maneuverability, everything, just went phenomenally well. We know that it is the best, but we also know the hard work that went into it and our competitors have a lot to do to keep up with us, but competition keeps us on the edge of our seats. TWZ: Modern flight tests are very rigorous. Do you see autonomy working in the same boundaries or do you foresee a need to rewrite the rulebook to be more agile? Gutierrez: I think the rulebook is being rewritten as we speak. We are at the bleeding edge and forcing regulators to catch up. Shield AI holds unique expertise in this industry, and our experts are able to explain the intent and then work with customers to shape test plans and meet criteria. We are hiring industry experts especially in mission planning airworthiness certification, which is a huge piece for us – managing FAA regulations, safety boards, and those kinds of areas. Also, professionals with a test and integration background, plus experts in modeling and simulation as well as operational analysis. Shield AI experts are working closely with the military and other industry partners. Shield AI The operational analysis, integration, and test modeling and simulation create that trifecta needed to successfully navigate operational test and evaluation and to build trust with your customer. You must have that pedigree of testing, especially for that kind of automated testing. It’s imperative that we show our customers that we understand how to develop and integrate with complex weapons systems. We are also talking about the definitions of the levels of autonomy, which hasn't been formally written down, so it’s difficult for certification boards to say whether you meet the intent and criteria. We are defining this and applying the tried and trusted methods that we're adopting. I mean, we don’t see a need to reinvent the wheel, just automate it. Adapting to what we see in the field is critical, making fixes, then getting it through testing fast. We must shorten that timeline. Historically, it’s taken months before a patch is deployed, and we want to get these upgrades out into the field within hours. We need to be audacious. TWZ: How do you envision Shield AI’s technologies and products complementing those of prime contractors or aircraft builders? Gutierrez: Traditionally, having a gap in capability leads to investing a ton of money to develop a very exquisite system. Once that system is finally operational, it may no longer be relevant. We've wrapped up the war in the Middle East and now we have a problem in the South China Sea, so a platform designed for one may no longer be effective for the other. That’s where Shield AI comes in and makes a weapon system more effective. For example, we can increase range. That’s not fuel range, but operating range, mission effectiveness range, advancing capabilities and technologies. We are not pitching our capabilities as a threat to industry, but as a vital partner to success. The bigger the partner and platform portfolio, the more powerful Shield AI’s value proposition becomes through the embedding of our Hivemind software. For example, the need to address stand-off in the South China Sea when a platform cannot penetrate. We can look at the set of problems around that penetration and develop a set of technologies to help overcome deficiencies in maybe something that has changed since the original requirements were set. Traditionally, this might necessitate a new aircraft or a different block upgrade, which equates to billions of dollars of investment. Shield AI can assess the issue and potentially help with a solution. It’s not easy to just drop in new hardware, but our compute hardware is super lightweight and small and it is absolutely able to make these more intelligent systems. TWZ: Can you explain how Shield AI autonomy can enhance platforms right now. Gutierrez: We talk about coming in as a software upgrade not hardware. They are currently limited to platform autonomy because they don’t have the technology to do the mission autonomy. Particularly with regard to unmanned systems, it's critically important to be able to push the envelope there. If you think of crewed aircraft such as the F-35, for example, a Shield AI solution could be configurable as a co-pilot. There’s a lot of things we can do to help protect the asset. You could enable cognitive behavior within your electronic warfare sensor suite. There might be signals that are not recognized, that haven't been registered before and you need to come back and send the signal out to somebody to process and then have a new jamming effect drawn up and then implemented. We could automatically update the mission data in flight, there and then, and the system would learn from it. That could continue exponentially. Shield AI says that it's autonomy could be used in the F-35, for example. Jamie Hunter TWZ: Looking forward, how do you see Shield AI’s approach to mission autonomy evolving? Gutierrez: We're trailblazing here and frankly ahead of what people can wrap their head around. We have to demonstrate our credentials, and we have to do all this ethically and partner with the right agencies. When we talk about working at the edge, we are talking about no communications – it’s the platform and its mission autonomy. So, how do you ensure it’s still doing the right things that you wanted it to do? We're currently working through that with a really slick solution that ensures there's essentially a third voter. Sort of like an arbitrator. It’s something that we're actively working on right now. It’s going to build great trust with our customers. It's not even the way it will monitor and ensure the location we want our platform to be at, it’s about keeping what we're doing safe and it's within the boundaries of the mission profile. TWZ: In terms of mission technology that’s developing fast, I’d assume Ukraine is a big focus right now? Gutierrez: We're keeping a close eye on what's going on there. We're seeing firsthand some of the technologies that are being employed by the Russians. The agility and speed to adapt and iterate has been shown to be critical, particularly in denied environments. It’s easy to see how you might initially enter an environment like that and operate effectively. But maybe just a few days later the adversary has adapted to throw your sensors off. You need to adapt, evolve, and that’s where we can help. But you can’t teach a system that’s not there. If you don’t have the hardware in the first place you cannot have an effect. That’s why we are not a threat to the platform, we're a partner capability enhancer. TWZ: In the next five years, what do you think will surprise people about developments in autonomy for aircraft, and perhaps other types of platforms. Gutierrez: We are assimilating a body of industry experts, and we've got fantastic leads and opportunities that will help us to address gaps in maritime operations, for example, be that surface or subsurface or within the space domain, within missile defense. There are legacy systems out there that need life extension, that next-generation capability and we are actively expanding into those market spaces. The definition of what cognitive autonomy is will be fully defined, and we will be at the bleeding edge of it. We have also been very thoughtful about awarding certification and about safety. We've also been very thoughtful about how we integrate into existing or developing platforms with our own compute hardware or our middleware. So, you're going to see Shield AI proliferate across many domains. Cognitive autonomy will become more understood and widely embraced, so in five years if we’re only talking about aircraft flying with our autonomy I would be surprised!

Australia To Send M1 Abrams Tanks To Ukraine	Australia will provide Ukraine with 49 M1A1 Abrams main battle tanks, a significant boost for Kyiv’s armored units, as they continue to face down Russia’s full-scale invasion. The announcement comes amid lingering questions about the effectiveness of the Abrams tanks that have already been supplied to Ukraine, including reports from this summer suggesting they had been briefly withdrawn from combat operations. We can’t confirm they actually were withdrawn, and surviving examples have meanwhile been upgraded, reflecting their continued relevance. Pat Conroy, Australia’s Minister for Defense Industry and Capability Delivery, told the press today that the surplus M1A1s would be transferred to Ukraine, ending a long period of speculation about their fate. The tanks have an estimated value of $164 million and bring total Australian military assistance to Ukraine to more than $1.3 billion. A formal announcement about the transfer will be made tomorrow, at the meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels. An Australian Army M1A1 Abrams tank from the 2nd Cavalry Regiment and an Australian Army soldier from the 3rd Battalion, The Royal Australian Regiment during Exercise Brolga Sprint 24 at Townsville Field Training Area, Queensland, in June 2024. Australian Department of Defense TPR Dana Millington 'These tanks will deliver more firepower and mobility to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, and complement the support provided by our partners for Ukraine for Ukraine’s armored brigades,' Conroy said in a statement. 'We stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine in their fight against Russia’s illegal invasion,' Conroy added. Since the tanks were originally sold to Australia by the United States, Washington had to approve the transfer to Ukraine. In an interview with ABC, Ukraine’s ambassador to Australia Vasyl Myroshnychenko described the tank transfer as a 'significant contribution' to Ukraine’s war effort. The development also marks a U-turn by the Australian government. Earlier this year, Australian Minister for Defense Richard Marles said that providing the tanks to Ukraine was 'not on the agenda.' Kyiv had previously requested that Australia consider providing it with Abrams tanks, as well as other heavy weapons. In the past, we pointed out how the upgraded former Australian F/A-18A/B Hornet fleet could be very useful for Ukraine, after which Ambassador Myroshnychenko confirmed to TWZ that Ukraine was indeed exploring if the fighters could be suitable for its very pressing needs. Since then, there have not been any further developments in this area, as far as we know. Also on Kyiv’s list was Australia’s fleet of 45 MRH90 Taipan helicopters, withdrawn last year after repeated cost increases, fleet groundings, and two major crashes. You can read more about that here. An Australian Army MRH90 Taipan at Townsville Field Training Area, Townsville, Queensland. Australian Department of Defense An Australian Army MRH90 Taipan from the 5th Aviation Regiment lands as part of air mobility operations with the 3rd Battalion, The Royal Australian Regiment on Exercise Brolga Run 23 at Townsville Field Training Area, Townsville, Queensland. COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE In the event, rather than donate the helicopters, Australia decided to strip them of valuable parts and bury them. Canberra’s decision to now provide the Abrams tanks should at least help assuage Ukraine’s disappointment in not securing the Taipans. On the other hand, it should also be noted that the age of the surplus M1A1s means that it might not be possible to put them all into service. Some may well also have to be reduced to spare parts if they are otherwise deemed too worn-out for frontline use. The Australian Army is able to give up its M1A1 fleet as it’s now receiving 75 new M1A2 Abrams, in the highly capable SEPv3 variant. You can read more about Australia’s $2.5-billion M1A2 acquisition here. One of the first M1A2 Abrams tanks for the Australian Army on display at the Land Forces Melbourne 2024 exhibition earlier this year. Australian Department of Defense Cpl Michael Currie Australia also confirmed that a small number of its 59 old tanks — 10 in total — will be retained to assist in the transition to the new tanks. It’s unclear if these will be used permanently for training or testing purposes or if they will also head to Ukraine later. Ukraine previously received 31 M1A1 tanks from the United States. The first of these had arrived in the country at least by September of last year, although the first video showing one of the tanks in action on the front lines didn’t emerge until February of this year. While the arrival of the U.S.-supplied Abrams in Ukraine came amid much fanfare, an apparent first loss of an M1A1, also in February, led to questions being raised about just how survivable these tanks are on the country’s highly contested battlefields. Imagery captured from a drone that looks to show one of Ukraine’s prized U.S.-supplied M1A1 Abrams tanks having suffered significant damage. via X Initially, it seems that the M1A1s were deployed mainly around Avdiivka, the key city in the eastern Donbas region, which was captured by Russian forces in mid-February. By May of this year, Ukrainian M1A1 were starting to get production-standard anti-drone armor screens, also commonly known as 'cope cages,' on their turrets. The modified Abrams also started receiving additional explosive reactive armor (ERA). A Ukrainian M1A1 Abrams with anti-drone armor screens on its turret. Metinvest Since then even more extreme modifications have surfaced, with one configuration including new plate armor and other additions. Via X Nevertheless, as losses continued to mount, unconfirmed reports emerged in the spring suggesting that Ukraine had withdrawn its M1A1s from frontline operations. By that time, five of the 31 tanks were confirmed as having been lost to Russian attacks. It was said that the reason for the withdrawal was the tank’s vulnerability to drone attacks, although the reasoning was somewhat hazy. As TWZ speculated at the time, it seems more likely that if the tanks were pulled it was because they are considered especially valuable assets, and having more examples knocked out — or, worse still, captured — by Russia would be an unpleasant propaganda and materiel loss for Kyiv. Preserving the dwindling force for when it was needed most and quickly upgrading them with additional protection could have also been a real factor.

Photo by Vlad Karkov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images SOPA Images Whatever the reasoning, and the reality of the supposed ‘combat pause,’ the U.S.-supplied M1A1s have recently been in the thick of the action, including contributing to the Ukrainian incursion into Russia’s Kursk region, which began in early August. Also involved have been examples of Ukraine’s other higher-end tank types, including the Challenger 2, Leopard 2, and T-80. A video from the fighting in Kursk from August showed the destruction of another M1A1, which brought the total losses to 16, according to the Oryx open-source tracking group — over half the force. While tank losses are always to be expected, especially during breakthrough operations and when faced with a proliferation of attack drones as well as relentless Russian artillery, questions about the Ukrainian Abrams have refused to go away. Ukrainian personnel interviewed by Western media outlets have raised concerns about the U.S.-made tank’s reliability and its vulnerability to Russian attacks. Explosive reactive tiles attached to a Ukrainian M1A1 Abrams. Unknown author/Twitter/X screencap Nevertheless, there’s no doubt that the M1A1 remains a very useful weapon and one that Ukraine only wants more of. This is especially the case now, as it begins to lose some ground to the larger Russian force. Kyiv is also still feeling the effects of the months-long pause on deliveries of military hardware from the United States after the funding available for security assistance to Ukraine ran out. The United States has so far not signaled that it’s willing to send more Abrams tanks to Ukraine even as they continue to commit to fielding more Bradley Fighting Vehicles. This makes today’s announcement from Australia all the more welcome for Ukraine. While we don’t yet know when the Australian-provided Abrams tanks will start to arrive in Ukraine, they will, at the very least, bolster what was always a fairly tokenistic force, in terms of numbers of vehicles. At the same time, increasing M1A1 numbers and growing experience with these tanks may yet see them finally overturn persisting doubts around their usefulness.

Army Looking To Shrink Typhon Missile System After Lessons Learne...	The U.S. Army is already interested in scaling down its new Typhon ground-based missile system, if possible, to help make it easier to deploy and operate. The service only sent Typhon, which currently uses large tractor-trailer launchers to fire Tomahawk cruise missiles and SM-6 multi-purpose missiles, overseas for the first time to the Philippines earlier this year. Typhon, also known as the Mid-Range Capability (MRC), was among the topics of discussion at a panel talk centered on the Army's new Multi-Domain Task Forces (MTDF) at the Association of the U.S. Army's (AUSA) main annual conference earlier today. Typhon is a key component of the current approved force structure for the service's three MDTFs. In addition to Typhon, each of the task forces is set to eventually incorporate units armed with the Dark Eagle hypersonic missiles and the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) short-range ballistic missiles, as well as a variety of air and missile defense, counter-drone, electronic warfare, and other advanced capabilities. A Typhon launcher in the Philippines. US Army 'So, the Mid-Range Capability, we fielded it, we have put it into the theater, but we're learning lessons on how we can improve the next evolutions of that,' Army Col. Michael Rose, commander of the 3rd MDTF headquartered at Fort Shafter in Hawaii, said today at AUSA. 'How do we make it more mobile? How do we make it smaller? How do we make it more agile? How do we employ it most effectively and how do we sustain it? A lot of those lessons are feeding back into our RDT&E [research, development, test, and evaluations] and acquisitions professionals to improve and enhance that new operational capability.' Rose did not elaborate further, but it is not hard to see how Typhon's current configuration, which is technically road-mobile and air-transportable, might present certain operational limitations. At the core of a typical Typhon battery at present are four trailer-based launchers, each towed by an 8&#215;8 tractor from the Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT) family. A fifth trailer, also towed by a HEMTT tractor, provides a mobile battery operations center (BOC). There are other supporting vehicles and equipment in the unit's inventory, as well. A briefing slide laying on the basic components of a typical Typhon battery. US Army It's also worth noting that each Typhon launcher, which is derived from the Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) used on various U.S. and foreign warships, can only hold up to four missiles at a time. As such, the entire battery can fire 16 missiles before needing to reload, which requires additional vehicles and equipment. The system does offer a wide breadth of capabilities given the abilities of the Tomahawk and the SM-6 to strike targets on land and at sea. The Army has also been eying the very versatile SM-6 for potential ground-based use in its surface-to-air mode. A crane is used to maneuver a missile canister during training to reload a US Army Typhon launcher in the Philippines. US Army Capt. Ryan DeBooy The picture seen below of a Typhon launcher rolling off a U.S. Air Force C-17 during 1st MDTF's first overseas deployment of elements of the system to the Philippines in April underscores the large size of the trailer-based components and their HEMTT prime movers. US Army Air Force cargo aircraft are in high demand even in peacetime and there are concerns already about the capacity of existing fleets to meet operational needs during future conflicts, especially in a potential high-end fight in the Pacific against China. There is a also growing focus within the U.S. military on concepts of operations involving dispersing forces across a wide network of operating locations to reduce their vulnerability, and many of those sites could well be completely inaccessible to larger airlifters like the C-17. There is also the matter of increasingly more capable and longer-range air defense threats. To be fair, it would have been an easy geolocation. There are just a few 1000 m runways for a C-17 in Luzon, and the very first image showed the launcher in front of a wall we've seen before. (The US has exercised here before.)

A couple of observations. pic.twitter.com/FW9B97sAMU&mdash; Dr. Jeffrey Lewis (@ArmsControlWonk) May 26, 2024 Typhon's size and weight could limit the ability to deploy the system by sea, especially in the absence of available established port facilities, or even over land depending on the environment. Insufficiently wide and/or strong bridges are already a well-known impediment to the movement of tanks and other heavy armored vehicles. Deployment limitations, along with other factors, also impact how and where the Typhon can be employed and create potential vulnerabilities. Col. Rose and the others on the MDTF panel at AUSA today did not offer any examples of potential or notional options for how Typhon might be scaled down or otherwise improved upon. The U.S. Marine Corps, which has been completely reorganizing itself to align with new expeditionary and distributed concepts of operations, is in the process of fielding a ground-based Tomahawk cruise missile launcher mounted on an uncrewed derivative of the 4&#215;4 Joint Light Tactical Vehicle. The Marines' Long Range Fires (LRF) launcher is substantially smaller and lighter than the Typhon launcher, but also can only be loaded with a single Tomahawk at a time. A Marine Corps Long Range Fires launcher vehicle. USMC The Army has also been experimenting with an uncrewed derivative of the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) called the Autonomous Multi-domain Launcher (AML) with a particular eye toward future dispersed operations. AML and HIMARS can both fire 227mm guided artillery rockets, as well as Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) and PRSM ballistic missiles, but, at least in their current forms, the launchers are not long enough to accommodate Tomahawk. AML might still be a starting place for a more truncated launcher for use with Typhon. HIMARS itself was originally developed as a way to fit at least some of the capabilities of the M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) into a package that could squeeze inside a C-130 cargo plane. It's also worth noting here that the U.S. Navy has been experimenting with containerized Mk 70 launchers, which are very similar in form and function to the Typhon launchers and are also based on the Mk 41 VLS, in ship and ground-based configurations. However, the ground-based arrangement that has been demonstrated to date is also a relatively large tractor-trailer setup. A Navy trailer-mounted Mk 70 launcher rolls off a US Air Force C-17 during training in Denmark in 2023. US Navy A US Navy trailer-mounted Mk 70 launcher in its deployed position. US Navy New, smaller missiles might be another option for scaling down Typhon. As a tangential example, the new PRSMs are notably smaller than the ATACMSs they are replacing, but offer longer range and other important capability boosts. At the same time, this would be a major shift for Typhon, especially given the investments the Army has made already in Tomahawk and SM-6. Developing something entirely new would be costly, as well. A test launch of a PRSM from a HIMARS launcher. Lockheed Martin In the meantime, Typhon has already made a significant mark in the Pacific region, being lauded by the U.S. military's counterparts in the Philippines and drawing the ire of China. The Philippine armed forces have even expressed an interest in acquiring their own Typhons. This has certainly presented a counter-example to questions raised in the past about where Typhon systems, as well as Dark Eagle hypersonic missiles, might be deployed, especially in the Pacific, at all due in part to potential resistance from allies and partners to host them. From where elements of the system are currently deployed in Northern Luzon, Typhon holds targets at risk in the southeastern end of mainland China, as well as on Hanan Island in the northern end of the South China Sea. Several Chinese man-made outposts elsewhere in the South China Sea, as well as targets at sea in the surrounding areas, would also be in range. Hainan, in particular, is home to several highly strategic naval and other bases. In September, the People's Liberation Army also conducted an extremely rare intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launch out over the Pacific from the island. All of this is a reminder of the importance of Typhon, and being able to deploy and employ it effectively, as well as the possible vulnerabilities that might come along with the system in its current form. Typhon, as well as Dark Eagle, which could face many of the same deployability issues with its trailer-based launchers, are presently set to be low-density, high-value assets that would be prime targets for an opponent, especially in a large-scale conflict. With all this in mind, it will be interesting to see how Typhon does or doesn't evolve, size-wise in or in any other regard, based on what the Army is still learning from its early fielding of the system.

Army Already Preparing For V-280 Valor To Dramatically Transform ...	The U.S. Army doesn’t expect to get its hands on the new V-280 Valor Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft, or FLRAA, until 2030 at the earliest, but it’s already developing tactics for when the advanced tiltrotor arrives. This fact illustrates just how much of a revolution FLRAA is anticipated to bring, including entirely overhauling the speed, range, and survivability of air assault operations. Speaking earlier today at the Association of the U.S. Army’s annual symposium, Maj. Gen. Brett Sylvia, commanding general of the 101st Airborne Division, explained the degree to which FLRAA will change the way that historic division, and other Army units, will go to war. U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Brett Sylvia, at that time 1st Cavalry Division Forward commander, now the commanding general of the 101st Airborne Division, at a combined arms rehearsal in Poland, June 6, 2020. U.S. Army photo by Spc. Javan Johnson Spc. Javan Johnson The forthcoming arrival of FLRAA has led to a new concept of operations for the Army, which is now taking shape. This is Large-Scale, Long-Range Air Assault, or L2A2, and, simply put, it relies upon the new tiltrotor to be realized. As TWZ has explored in the past, the specific range and speed advantage of the V-280 Valor was very likely a significant reason why it was chosen for FLRAA ahead of Boeing’s rival SB>1 Defiant. While the engineering and manufacturing development phase for FLRAA continues, the Army is practicing the L2A2 concept using the aircraft it has on hand. According to Sylvia, L2A2 is defined by the ability to 'deliver one Brigade Combat Team in one period of darkness, over 500 miles, arriving behind enemy lines, and be able to conduct sustained combat operations.' 'We can’t do that right now is because the platforms that we have organic to the 101st are not enough in order for us to be able to do that in one period of darkness,' Sylvia added.

Jacob Derry Staff Sgt. Jacob Derry Instead, over the last 12 months, the 'The Screaming Eagles' have undertaken four exercises to explore what it takes to move a Brigade Combat Team over that distance, all the while moving exclusively at night. In the latest of these training events, the division’s 2nd Brigade Combat Team was moved to the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) at Fort Johnson, Louisiana. The 101st is home-based at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, 575 miles distant, from where the simulated air assault was launched. While moving from one location to the other was achieved, it required the division to set up two mission support sites and six Forward Arming and Refueling Points (FARPs) en route to ensure the movement of the helicopter assault force. More significantly, it also required three nights in order to be able to move that entire Brigade Combat Team under the cover of darkness. Meanwhile, staffing all of the mission support sites and FARPs, as well as related security and sustainment forces, required almost a thousand soldiers.

Wes Wright The next part of the training was done as a simulation, this time involving the future Air Assault CAB, a formation created to ensure the Army can conduct L2A2. As Sylvia explained, the Air Assault CAB is going to have four times the number of heavy-lift aircraft than what he has available today, and all of the unit’s UH-60 Black Hawks will be replaced by FLRAA.

U.S. Army 'When we ran that in simulation, we were able to execute that one Brigade Combat Team move in one period of darkness, so we made our timeline,' Sylvia said. 'But the second thing, and probably more critical than that, was that we cut in half that sustainment and security that we needed. We went down to one mission support site and only three Forward Arming and Refueling Points in order to be able to execute that. I don’t think I need to tell you what that does in terms of our survivability, because of our speed and our lower signature when we can execute that.' Over the course of the next few years, the Army will continue to build its Air Assault Combat Aviation Brigade, to meet L2A2 aspirations. In the meantime, as Sylvia said, 'We are doing the things in order to be able to build the foundation so that all we have to do is just receive the aircraft and we’ll be ready to execute.' 'What we can do, is we can build the tactics, techniques, and procedures, build the doctrine, build the structures, understand the sustainment in order to be able to do that.'

(Bell) Sylvia also addressed how the Army was working to adapt how its future mission support sites and FARPs would look like so that they can survive and be effective during large-scale conflicts with peer or near-peer adversaries, including over significant distances, as will be found in the Indo-Pacific theater. Sylvia said the 101st Airborne Division’s current training is exploring changes to support sites and FARPs so they can 'operate in a semi-permissive or in a non-permissive environment.' In the future, the Army’s FARPs will have to be 'dispersed, distributed, and much smaller,' Sylvia noted. Sylvia recalled one of the exercises that explored new ways of distributing FARPs. 'We didn’t land like we traditionally do, where you go, you take over an airfield, and you park all your aircraft out there in the field. So now we are taking our aircraft, we are parking them in a very distributed manner, not on airfields. We’re camouflaging the aircraft, camouflaging the FARPs out there.'

U.S. Air Force photo by Capt. Jessica Tait Capt. Jessica Tait A resurgence in interest in camouflaging such assets to deceive opponents and otherwise help to conceal the movements and activities of friendly forces is something that we have examined in the past and is especially relevant for any future high-end fight involving the United States, such as one against China in the Pacific. Initial findings have been highly encouraging, Sylvia noted. 'During one of our exercises, when we got done afterward, and we were talking with the opposing force commander, he said, ‘Hey, I had great success in finding and targeting your FARPs.’ And I said, ‘Yeah, how many did you get?’ And he said, ‘I got two.’ I said, ‘Did you know I had nine out there?’ And he said, ‘Obviously I wasn’t as good as I thought I was.’ And so that’s the point. We do have to think about how we do these things differently. New capabilities certainly are great, but I think our tactics and techniques are the things that are going to be most effective in the near term.' A first FLRAA for the Army is expected to take to the air in 2026, with low-rate initial production slated to begin in 2028, leading to initial fielding in 2030. While the Army may be pinning its hopes of achieving Large-Scale, Long-Range Air Assault firmly on FLRAA, that doesn’t mean the UH-60 will be disappearing any time soon. A prototype V-280 Valor.

Clair Gill, Commanding General at the U.S. Army Aviation Center of Excellence and Fort Novosel, said that the future force mix will come down to the specific situation and operational demands at the time — as well as budgetary constraints. 'Would I love to put a FLRAA everywhere that there's a Black Hawk? Sure. Do I think it’s affordable? Probably not,' Gill told reporters. 'The Black Hawk is coming up on 40 years old, I believe, and my sense is the Black Hawk is going to compete with the B-52 and C-130 for going the distance. We’re going to have Black Hawks in our formation as long as any of us are reading the news.' 'I think FLRAA is going to come on.' Gill continued. 'We’re going to learn a lot about it. We’re going to scale it. We’re going to see where we are in the 2030s, once we go to full-rate production and we get that first limited test unit out, learn a lot about it, we got to figure out how we train it. We start proliferating it. And if it, if it is that game-changing technology and everybody says that we’ve got to double down, then maybe we buy more. But I think initially it’s going to be some sort of a mix, and I don’t see the Black Hawk going away.'

Thousands Of North Korean Troops To Help Russia Fight Ukraine: Re...	Thousands of North Korean troops are being trained to provide combat power in Ukraine to help Russia make up for mounting losses, according to reports. The move is part of a growing alliance between Moscow and Pyongyang that benefits both parties in several ways. 'The North Koreans will form part of the ‘Special Buryat Battalion,’ organized within the 11th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade of the Russian Armed Forces,' the Ukrainian Liga media outlet reported on Tuesday. 'The battalion is expected to include up to 3,000 North Korean troops and is currently being supplied with small arms and ammunition.' First notable glimpse at DPRK troop contribution to Russia. A 'Buryat battalion' consisting of DPRK personnel were stood up in the 11th Guards Air Assault Brigade. It’s made up of around 3,000 personnel for Ukraine’s Kursk salient. 18 members deserted. Dillon Payton (@dillonrpayton) October 15, 2024 Liga suggested that the battalion could be deployed near the Ukrainian-occupied town of Sudzha in Russia’s Kursk region, but the exact location or arrival time remains unknown. The Ukrainian Suspline news outlet suggested that there are already a number of North Korean troops there. Meanwhile, North Koreans could also find themselves fighting on Ukrainian soil, Andriy Kovalenko, head of Ukraine’s Center for Countering Disinformation, said on Telegram. Thousands of North Korean infantry soldiers are undergoing training in Russia and could be deployed to the front line in Ukraine by the end of this year, The Washington Post wrote last week, citing a Ukrainian military intelligence official. 'The official said North Korean officers are already on the ground in Russia-occupied Ukraine to observe Russian forces and study the battlefield, but Kyiv hasn’t seen any North Korean units fighting yet,' the Post reported. As we previously noted, dozens of North Koreans are behind Russian lines in Ukraine. They are operating 'in teams that support launcher systems for KN-23 [short-range ballistic] missiles,' a source in Ukraine told The Guardian last week. North Korea began supplying Russia with those missiles, also known as Hwasong-11s, but about half were defective, according to an analysis from Ukrainian state prosecutors. One report claims that 10,000 North Korean troops have been dispatched to assist Russia. North Korean troops, as we previously noted, have already been killed in Ukraine. While Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Thursday dismissed claims of Pyongyang sending military personnel to fight in Ukraine as a 'hoax,' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky insisted that it is happening. 'We see an increasing alliance between Russia and regimes like North Korea,' Zelensky said during his evening address on Sunday. 'This is no longer just about transferring weapons. It is actually about transferring people from North Korea to the occupying military forces. Obviously, in such circumstances, our relations with partners need to develop further.' On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin submitted a draft law to the Russian State Duma seeking ratification of a strategic partnership between Moscow and Pyongyang, hammered in June. It calls for each side to provide military assistance to each other in the event of war. 'In the event that one of the Parties is subjected to an armed attack by a State or several States and thus finds it in a state of war, the other Party will immediately provide military and other assistance with all available means at its disposal, in accordance with Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations and in accordance with the legislation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Russian Federation,' the agreement stated. While the western world maintains a strategy of wishing it will all go away, Putin solidifies North Korea as the weapons manufacturing department of his terror coalition, submitting for ratification the mutual defense treaty between the two countries. KyivPost (@KyivPost) October 15, 2024 All this comes in the wake of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un’s visit to Russia last year for a summit with Putin where the two men bolstered their deepening ties with a shadowy arms deal. It was reported that, among other things, it called for Pyongyang to send construction and engineering forces to Russia-occupied territories of Ukraine for rebuilding work. There was no indication of how many personnel would be involved or the exact nature of their work. It is unclear whether that actually occurred. There are several reasons why a mutual aid pact could be highly attractive to both parties. It benefits North Korea in several ways. The cash-starved nation can receive economic and military assistance from Russia by providing its biggest available resource - personnel - in return. It could also gain real-world combat experience on a relatively modern battlefield, something its troops have not had in decades. Pyongyang has already been sanctioned by the U.S. for sending forced labor to distant counties as a way of raising money for the regime. North Korean troops fighting Ukraine help Russia make up for what the Pentagon said is the loss of some 600,000 troops killed and wounded since the beginning of the all-out invasion. It also assists Putin in avoiding an unpopular larger conscription, according to the Kyiv Post, citing sources in the Ukrainian Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR). 'Putin is doing everything possible to delay and avoid the decision to conduct a new full-fledged wave of mobilization on the territory of the Russian Federation,' the publication reported. Last month, GUR commander Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov said Russia was facing a troop shortfall. 'In this period (in the summer of 2025), they will face a dilemma - either to announce mobilization or in some way it is necessary to reduce the intensity of hostilities a little, which may, in the end, be critical for them,' he said, according to the Interfax news outlet. How well North Korean troops will perform is an open question. About 18 have already fled their positions in Kursk and Bryansk, according to the Ukrainian Suspine news outlet. 18 servicemen from North Korea reportedly escaped from Russian positions on the border of Bryansk region and Kursk region, Ukraine's Suspilnyi reports, citing intelligence sources.The reasons for the escape have not been established. Russian Army has launched a search. pic.twitter.com/BMQNCxSKnL&mdash; Clash Report (@clashreport) October 15, 2024 Another huge issue is language, said Kovalenko. 'Less than 1% of the personnel officers of the army of the DPRK speak Russian,' he noted. 'This is important to understand in order to analyze the possibilities of involving these military personnel in the actions of the Russian army in the future.' North Korea is no stranger to foreign deployments. It sent a fighter squadron to back up its communist ally North Vietnam during that conflict, noted Samual Ramani, DPhil/PhD Intl Relations @UniofOxford Associate Fellow @RUSI_org and author 'Russia in Africa' and 'Putin's War on Ukraine.' It dispatched pilots to fly on Egyptian jets during the 1973 Arab-Israeli War and military trainers to back up Iran's forces during the Iran-Iraq War. 'North Korea simultaneously was carrying out an even higher intensity military campaign in Angola,' Ramani said on Twitter. 'About 3,000 North Korean troops and 1,000 advisors backed the Angolan MPLA alongside Cuba and against apartheid South Africa's forces.' Pyongyang provided military assistance to other African nations as well, including Mozambique and Zimbabwe. 'Post-Cold War, North Korea's interventions dried up but training (including allegedly of Hezbollah on tunnel building) persisted Syria was a theatre where the Chalma brigades fought on Bashar al-Assad's behalf,' Ramani wrote. North Korea has been accused of sending forces to UkraineNorth Korea has a long history of deploying forces to overseas conflictsHere's the whole history /1&mdash; Samuel Ramani (@SamRamani2) October 14, 2024 While relatively small numbers of troops from other nations help both sides in this conflict, there has been no large-scale mobilization of foreign forces for either party. North Korea sending thousands of soldiers to help Russia would be a major change in that status quo, although just how much effect they could have remains unclear.

Oshkosh Talks Its 30mm Cannon-Wielding Medium Caliber Weapon Syst...	Oshkosh Defense’s 30mm Medium Caliber Weapon System (MCWS), integrated with the Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicle Double V Hull, offers what the company calls 'a transformative lethality solution for the U.S. Army.' Since the MCWS contract award in 2021, Oshkosh has partnered with the Army to incorporate a range of features designed specifically for the Stryker mission. The MCWS turret leverages the proven Rafael Samson Remote Weapon System and Fire Control System, providing heavy firepower with its XM813 30mm cannon and M240 coaxial weapon, as well as increased engagement range and enhanced situational awareness, all without compromising the Stryker’s mobility and survivability. The Stryker MCWS will replace the predecessor Infantry Carrier Vehicle – Dragoon (ICVD). Soldiers recently had a chance to test the MCWS during Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation (FOT&E), which assessed operational effectiveness and suitability in realistic conditions. Oshkosh Defense is actively delivering vehicles to the U.S. Army to ensure the timely fielding to the first Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT) in early 2025, marking a key milestone in the program.

Joint German-Italian Battle Tank Venture Could Shake Up European ...	Two major defense players from Italy and Germany have teamed up to build tanks and infantry fighting vehicles, initially aimed to meet the requirements of the Italian Army, but also for other customers, as armored warfare makes a resurgence in Europe and elsewhere. Under a 50:50 joint venture announced today, and following on from an earlier corresponding Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), Leonardo Rheinmetall Military Vehicles (LRMV) will develop and then build a version of Rheinmetall company’s KF51 Panther main battle tank and KF41 Lynx infantry fighting vehicle for the Italian Army. Thereafter, the two firms will market the vehicles to other potential customers. Whilst not a contract award, the establishment of the joint venture suggests it’s highly likely that the Panther and Lynx will be the platforms of choice for Italy, especially as other possible candidates have dropped out of the running. Should that happen, the two solutions from LRMV be chosen, as seems likely, the Panther will replace the Italian Army’s current fleet of locally made Ariete main battle tanks, developed in the 1980s. Italian Army Ariete tanks during an exercise at Capo Teulada in October 2022. Italian Army Meanwhile, the Lynx infantry fighting vehicle would be at the center of the Italian Army’s Armored Infantry Combat System (AICS) program, replacing the current Dardo IFVs, and surviving Cold War-era M113 armored personnel carriers. AICS is a wide-ranging effort that will eventually field as many as 16 different variants, including recovery, combat engineer, and bridge-laying vehicles. Italian Army troops exiting a Dardo infantry fighting vehicle. Italian Army The AICS also includes specialized combat vehicles, among them reconnaissance and anti-tank versions, as well as ones fitted with the Skyranger air defense system, reflecting the growing importance of short-range air defenses to deal with drones and other battlefield aerial threats. A prototype KF41 Lynx fitted with a Skyranger 30mm air defense turret. Rheinmetall Angela Micheletto LRMV determines that all its AICS vehicles will be based on the Lynx infantry fighting vehicle version, benefiting from the modular nature of its design. The AICS initiative calls for advanced features including open architecture, significant command-and-control capability, and the ability to share targeting data with a variety of other platforms. The fighting vehicles will also be expected to work alongside drones and uncrewed ground vehicles and to engage targets with different rounds, including airburst types. Scalable armor and other protective systems will defend them against improvised explosive devices, anti-tank missiles, and swarming drones, among other threats. . The Italian Army has a requirement for over one thousand AICS vehicles of all types. Reportedly, Italy plans to build 20 prototypes of the AICS by 2027 or 2028, with deliveries to begin between 2029 and 2041. Production of all vehicles for Italy — Panther and AICS — will be primarily handled at a new plant in La Spezia, Italy. This facility will be responsible for 60 percent of the manufacture of all vehicles. Italy’s Leonardo will also be responsible for the mission systems, electronics suites, and weapons integration on all vehicles ordered for the Italian Army. 'We are creating a new heavyweight in European tank production,' said Armin Papperger, CEO of Rheinmetall. 'Leonardo and Rheinmetall, two leading European suppliers of defense technology, are joining forces to carry out ambitious projects. We are primarily addressing the Italian market, but we will also be targeting other partner nations which are in need of modernizing their combat systems in the future. Rheinmetall has the perfect technologies for Italy’s requirements.' Meanwhile, Roberto Cingolani, CEO of Leonardo, described the joint venture as 'a significant step towards the creation of a European defense system based on specialized shared platforms. Rheinmetall and Leonardo aim at developing state-of-the-art technologies able to compete at international level.' A prototype KF41 Lynx with the Skyranger 30mm air defense turret. Rheinmetall Today’s announcement is also a significant turnaround for Italian Army armored vehicle development and one that could have major repercussions across the continent. Before Leonardo teamed up with Rheinmetall, it had planned to develop and build new fighting vehicles for Italy in partnership with KNDS. KNDS is a European defense company that came from the merger between Germany’s Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and France’s Nexter Systems. Under the earlier agreement, Leonardo and KNDS would have jointly produced Leopard 2 main battle tanks (originally designed by Krauss-Maffei Wegmann) for the Italian Army. Lynx KF41 infantry fighting vehicle. Rheinmetall The Italian parliament had even approved the Leopard 2 purchase, before the collapse of the partnership, which came about when KNDS reportedly rejected Leonardo’s plans to install a significant proportion of its own systems on the tanks. By going with Rheinmetall and the still-in-development KF51 Panther, Italy should be able to tailor the tank more closely to its own requirements. On the other hand, while the Leopard 2 was an off-the-shelf product that would have been able to be fielded fairly rapidly by the Italian Army, the service will have to wait longer for the Panther — perhaps as long as 10 years, according to some accounts. That long timeline also raises the possibility of a clash of rival European tank designs. While Rheinmetall introduced its Panther as a private venture project, Germany and France had meanwhile teamed up on a political level to push the development of another new main battle tank, the more ambitious Main Ground Combat System (MGCS). MGCS is set to replace German Leopard 2 and French Leclerc main battle tanks and was due to arrive in service beginning in 2035. While a technology demonstrator for the MGCS program, the Enhanced Main Battle Tank, combining Leclerc and Leopard 2 components, was unveiled in 2018, progress since then has been slow. A French Army Leclerc tank during the Strong Europe Tank Challenge co-hosted by U.S. Army Europe and the German Army, in May 2017. U.S. Army photo by Staff Sgt. Kathleen V. Polanco Staff Sgt. Kathleen Polanco A reported requirement for the MGCS is for its gun to be at least 50 percent more capable than the existing 120mm types on either the Leclerc or Leopard 2. As TWZ has discussed in the past, a larger 130mm or 140mm gun would certainly offer improved range and armor penetration capabilities. Earlier this year, KNDS rolled out a new version of the Leopard 2 with a completely uncrewed turret that can be armed with a 140mm main gun. KNDS plans to offer the tank for sale but also expects it to be a key stepping stone to the next-generation MGCS. A Leopard 2 demonstrator with an uncrewed turret armed with a 140mm main gun. KNDS Notably, the KF51 Panther is armed with a 130mm caliber main gun. Having Italy choose the Panther is a major vote of confidence that might lead to it forming the basis of the MGCS, but that might well not be a satisfying result for Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, in particular, which is currently still building the Leopard 2 and would want to stay firmly in the MBT game, perhaps with an up-gunned Leopard 2 or a derivative for MGCS. In the meantime, the value of the Italian procurement will be significant. When it was still planning to buy Leopard 2s, Italy expected the acquisition program would be worth around $8.6 billion, for 270 tanks, while another $16 billion would be invested in the AICS program.

Photo by Craig Stennett/Getty Images Craig Stennett An armored vehicle spending spree of this kind would have been surprising only a few years ago, but Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has dramatically changed the defense and security landscape in Europe. In particular, with tank warfare being a prominent feature of the fighting in Ukraine, the idea of investing in new main battle tank fleets, as well as spending on armored fighting vehicles in general, has made a comeback. As we noted in our previous discussion of the Panther, the design of this tank seems to be especially relevant for this new era. Overall, it should be lighter and more agile than current main battle tanks, while carrying a bigger main gun, and having the ability to provide stand-in surveillance and strike with loitering munitions. This addresses some of the concerns about the vulnerability of tanks to various weapons, especially loitering munitions and first-person view (FPV) drones, which have played a prominent role in Ukraine. With Italy looking now more likely than ever to emerge as the first customer for the KF51 Panther, this may well encourage further orders for the tank, as well as for the KF41 Lynx. Meanwhile, LRMV will be paying close attention to developments in the MGCS, with the Panther now looking well-positioned to make a challenge for this highly important program, too.

New Patriot Missile Interceptor Axed By Army	The U.S. Army is no longer pursuing a new interceptor for its Patriot surface-to-air missile systems. The disclosure as the service has also said it wants to reduce reliance on the highly in demand and heavily strained Patriot force and look more at tailored air defense force packages leveraging its Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS) network. Army Brig. Gen. Frank Lozano announced the decision regarding what had been known as the Lower-Tier Future Interceptor (LTFI), in a live interview with Defense News' Jen Judson from the floor of the Association of the U.S. Army's (AUSA) main annual conference. Lozano is head of the service's Program Executive Office for Missiles and Space. Gen Lozano, PEO Missiles & Space, tells @JenJudson that they have cancelled the Lower Tier Future Interceptor program, which would have succeeded the PAC-3 MSE. Instead they will upgrade MSE, and want to move forward with THAAD integration into IBCS. #AUSA2024 pic.twitter.com/NZMPgDH4KP&mdash; Colby Badhwar (@ColbyBadhwar) October 15, 2024 'So, right now, the Army has decided that we are not going to move forward on what we were calling a Lower Tier Future Interceptor,' Lozano told Judson. 'That was going to be a very expensive endeavor. &#8230; Interceptors in that family or class of interceptors are very capable, but also very expensive.' The Army had previously defined 'lower-tier' in this instance as the 'lower tier portion of the ballistic missile defense battlespace' and described the LTFI as being set to help 'increase Air and Missile Defense (AMD) capability through increased velocity, altitude, and maneuverability.' Lozano did not elaborate on cost, but the unit price of a PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) interceptor, the most advanced type now available for Patriot, is just under $4.2 million, according to Army budget documents. 'After going through a business case analysis within the PEO and with the Army senior leaders, what we've decided to do is, one, look at continuing to upgrade the PAC-3 MSE missile, which I believe is probably the best air defense missile in the world, [and] continue to advance that capability so that it can remain relevance against the evolving threats,' Lozano added. The PAC-3 MSE is already a substantial improvement over precious PAC-3 variants, as you can read about in more detail here. Current Patriot launchers can also be loaded with a mix of PAC-3 MSEs and older interceptor types. An overview of the improvements found on the PAC-3 MSE variant over its predecessors. Lockheed Martin An overview of the improvements found on the PAC-3 MSE variant over its predecessors, including a 'New LE [lethality enhancer].' Lockheed Martin A graphic highlighting the ability to load multiple types of interceptors onto a single Patriot launcher. Lockheed Martin A complete Patriot battery today can consist of up to eight launchers, along with an AN/MPQ-65 multifunction phased array radar and various fire control, communications, and other support equipment. The Army is also in the process of adding a new radar, called the Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS), to the Patriot ecosystem. In addition, Lozano said that the Army has been looking more at how the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) ballistic missile defense system can directly complement Patriot thanks to the new ICBS network. Developed by Northrop Grumman, IBCS is designed to offer an open-architecture command and control and networking environment to link together various air defense sensors and effectors, as you can learn more about here. 'What that would allow us to do is create a tighter coupling between the THAAD system and the Patriot system and via that tighter coupling, then you can manage the battle space in a much more efficient way,' Lozano told Judson. 'You could launch a THAAD interceptor against a particular target and then, as backup, launch a PAC-3 interceptor and it opens up the amount of battle space that you can use to take advantage of two interceptors against a very stressing threat&#8230; and in that same vein maintain the magazine depth of both family of interceptors.' The Missile Defense Agency (MDA), in cooperation with the Army and others, has been experimenting with the integration of components of the THAAD and Patriot systems in recent years. The decision to axe the LFTI effort also highlights broader discussions the Army is having now about the future of its Patiort force, which has been and continues to be in extremely high demand, but also too small to adequately meet those operational needs. The total number of THAAD batteries is even smaller and that system is also managed outside of the Army by the MDA. These are issues The War Zone has highlighted in the past, including just yesterday in the context of the emergency THAAD deployment to Israel. A THAAD transporter-erector-launcher is loaded onto a US Air Force C-17A Globemaster III transport aircraft at Fort Sill, Texas, bound for Israel as part of a training exercise in 2019. DOD The Army is looking to expand its Patriot force, but also scale back its use. 'We have relied too long on the Patriot system as the centric system to air and missile defense,' Army Lt. Gen. Sean Gainey, head of that service’s Space and Missile Defense Command (SDMC), said during a panel discussion at AUSA yesterday. 'We are modernizing now with the short-range air defense and moving forward with our IFPC [Indirect Fire Protection Capability] cruise missile defense, and our improvements to our current system[s], with the integration into IBCS, it will eventually start to relieve that significant stress.' The IFPC program, and the Enduring Shield system at the center of it, is a particularly significant part of the Army's broader air and missile defense modernization plans. The primary interceptor for Enduring Shield, which the service is working toward fielding operationally now, is the AIM-9X Sidewinder. An palletized Enduring Shield launcher. Leidos There are already plans for a second interceptor for Enduring Shield that is more optimized for the counter-cruise missile role. The Army has publicly laid out a vision for a design that offers capabilities akin to the AIM-120D Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), but in the same form factor as the AIM-9X. Whatever the new interceptor might look like, it could give Enduring Shield an expanded medium-range air and missile defense capability. The Army's current lack of a surface-to-air missile system in this middle tier has added to the strain on the Patriot force, which has filled this gap since the retirement of the Hawk system in the 1990s. The Army is also looking to deploy and employ all of its ground-based air defense capabilities in more tailored and potentially disaggregated ways in the future, thanks in large part to the power of the IBCS network. 'The force structure that we are building and growing is tailorable, it's adaptable, and it is able to kind of flexibly meet whatever needs we have in any hotspot in the world,' Gabe Camarillo, Under Secretary of the Army, said at the same AUSA panel yesterday as Lt. Gen. Gainey. 'We can compose this in any shape or fashion.' 'What I want to be able to do is to be able to provide a Chinese menu, if you will, to combatant commanders, so that once they perform their assessment of the threat, they can say, 'Frank, give me three of those, one of those, 10 of those, four of those,'' Brig. Gen. Lozano, another member of the panel, also said. 'And we deliver that capability, integrated and able to function and work together to defeat any threat any given Combat Commander faces.' There are questions about how realistic this kind of mission-to-mission tailoring of air defense force packages might be in terms of maintaining readiness and cohesion, especially when it comes to training and otherwise preparing disparate units to work together down range. The Army does seem to be betting heavily on the ability of IBCS to allow the rapid fuzing of different air and missile defense capabilities down-range. At the panel yesterday, Brig. Gen. Lozano shared an anecdote about how lessons learned from the ongoing war in Ukraine are reinforcing the service's focus on IBCS: 'About a year and a half ago, I took a trip over to Poland to visit Ukrainian soldiers training on the first two batteries of Patriot that we were donating to them. One was a U.S. battery, one was a German battery. Had the privilege of eating lunch with some of those Ukrainian Air defenders. And at the end of that lunch, I asked them, I'm curious, &#8230; based on your employment of Patriot, and Avenger, and Hawk, and Stinger MANPAD [man portable air defense] systems, NASAMS [National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System], how are you managing the battle space to ensure you have the most efficient application of combat power against the threats that Russia is throwing at you. And they said, you know, sir, you've hit on our most significant struggle. If there was a way that we had a system that could integrate all of those capabilities that would make us much more effective in that employment of combat power. Do you have something you can give us? And I said, Well, I can't get ahead of the President. I'm not allowed to offer anything up, but I will tell you that we've recognized that same thing. And so when a lot of people ask me, what are some of the most important lessons that we've learned from Ukraine, from an air and missile defense perspective, what has been reaffirming to me is that the modernization path that we are on is exactly the right path to be on.' The video below highlights various Western-supplied and other air defense systems in service in Ukraine, including Patriot. The fighting in Ukraine has also broadly underscored the importance of layered integrated air defense networks capable of tackling multiple tiers of threats, from kamikaze drones to ballistic missiles, and doing so simultaneously. Much still remains to be seen about how the Army's air and missile defense force structure evolves going forward. At the same time, it is clear that major developments in terms of capabilities, as well as tactics, techniques, and procedures, are still on the horizon despite the end of plans for the next-generation interceptor for Patriot.

China’s Large Tiltrotor Drone Breaks Cover	China has revealed the first example of a new tiltrotor drone, United Aircraft’s UR6000, that has clear military potential, despite initially being pitched for civilian missions. The drone is notably large, providing a very useful load-carrying capability, and relatively offering high-speed and long-range. The photo, seen at the top of this story, dated October 11, shows what is said to be the first completed UR6000 prototype on the production line at the Wuhu United Aircraft Production Workshop in the Wuhu Aviation Industrial Park in China’s eastern Anhui province. A placard in front of the aircraft states that this is 'the first machine delivered off the line.' An official confirmed earlier this year that the project was at that time in the early prototyping phase. United Aircraft The UR6000 project — also apparently known as the R6000 and as the Zhang Ying, or Steel Shadow — was originally launched at the Singapore Airshow earlier this year when a less-than-detailed conceptual model was presented. Featuring high-mounted wings of constant chord, the UR6000 has tilting three-blade proprotors in engine nacelles mounted on the wingtips. It appears that the design has copied Bell’s new-generation tiltrotor technology, as used in the V-280 Valor, where instead of the whole nacelle rotating, only the front portion pivots. This solution is said to decrease complexity and increase reliability, as well as performance, compared with earlier tiltrotor concepts where the whole nacelle rotates, like on the V-22 Osprey. The V-280 Valor demonstrator during a test flight. Bell The Valor demonstrator during a test flight. (Bell) The U-shaped tail has a plank-like horizontal tailplane with a large vertical stabilizer mounted on each end. Two large canard-like surfaces are mounted just aft of the cockpit. Although these appear to be mainly intended to accommodate the main landing gear, it's possible they could perhaps also be used to mount smaller stores or sensors. Initial concept artwork shows a large cargo door on the port side, located toward the aft section of the fuselage. At this stage, the powerplant for the UR6000 is unclear, although it is certainly planned to be powered by turboshaft engines. Initial assessments suggest that each engine will be rated at between 1,500 and 2,000 horsepower and that a variable-speed gearbox is used to manage the different power requirements for vertical and horizontal flight modes. United Aircraft has released some provisional specifications for the tiltrotor drone. These include a maximum takeoff weight of 13,448 pounds (6,100 kilograms), a payload capacity of 4,409 pounds (2,000 kilograms), a cruise speed of 432 miles an hour (550 kilometers an hour), a service ceiling of 25,000 feet (7,620 meters), and a maximum range of 932 miles (1,500 kilometers). How accurate these numbers end being is yet to be seen. Reportedly, development of the UR6000 began in 2021 and certification is expected to be completed by 2027. It seems the next milestone could be at the Zhuhai Air Show later this year, with reports that the prototype of the tiltrotor drone will be formally unveiled there. #ZhuhaiAirShow2024 get readyWorld's first 6 ton tilt-rotor huge UAV 'Steel Shadow' R6000to be unveiled pic.twitter.com/4cunj4WEL0&mdash; Húrin (@Hurin92) October 2, 2024 The UR6000 is described by the manufacturer as an autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV), however, there are also reports that, in the longer term, the design will be adapted to carry up to 10 passengers as an alternative to cargo. That indicates that a larger crewed version of the tiltrotor is also envisaged. Concept artwork of an apparent crewed version of the UR6000 in a generic civil-type color scheme. United Aircraft At this stage, the tiltrotor drone is being pitched for civilian missions, although it would seem to have obvious military applications too. At least one picture on United Aircraft’s website now shows the UR6000 in People’s Liberation Army (PLA) markings. United Aircraft While United Aircraft is not among the largest Chinese aerospace entities, it does have considerable experience designing and building rotary-wing drones, including smaller quadcopters as well as larger types with coaxial rotor arrangements. These are primarily intended for logistics and surveillance, as well as firefighting and emergency response.

Its accommodation for 10, passengers also compares closely with the AW609’s seating for up to 12 passengers in a high-density configuration. Leonardo's AW609 tiltrotor conducts shipboard trials aboard the Italian aircraft carrier ITS Cavour. Leonardo Leonardo In the military realm, the UR6000 also makes an interesting comparison with Bell’s V-247 Vigilant, which was originally pitched to meet the U.S. Marine Corps multirole, VTOL-capable drone program, known as MUX. The Marines wanted MUX to have a minimum internal payload capacity of 3,000 pounds, the ability to carry between 3,000 to 9,000 pounds of weapons or other stores externally, a cruising speed between 230 and 345 miles per hour, an unrefueled combat radius of 350 to 700 miles, and the ability to refuel in flight. In its original form, the V-247 was designed with a maximum gross weight of over 30,000 pounds, but this has since been downsized to about 28,000 pounds to satisfy U.S. Navy requirements, including operating from smaller-deck warships. Vigilant’s long-range cruise is now listed as 240 knots with a maximum continuous cruising speed of 300 knots. Its redesigned internal mission payload is 2,000 pounds and it has a 9,000-pound slingload capacity. A proposed U.S. Navy version of Bell’s V-247 Vigilant. Bell It's very possible that the PLA may order further specific military modifications of the UR6000 to suit its requirements. The tiltrotor could also join a growing family of fixed-wing Chinese transport drones that have dual-role civilian and military applications. A tiltrotor drone, in particular, could well be suitable for a range of missions, especially in the Indo-Pacific theater, in which access to conventional airstrips would likely be limited in wartime and there is an enduring requirement to deliver cargoes to remote locations like Chinese island outposts in the South China Sea. While the U.S. military is increasingly looking at how to best address expeditionary missions in this environment, it’s also of huge importance for the PLA, as it seeks to expand its reach across the Pacific, including operations from small island airstrips as well as a growing fleet of amphibious assault ships that would be ideal platforms for the UR6000. Potentially offering long-range and fast-cruising, as well as a significant payload capacity for a VTOL drone, the UR6000 is certainly an intriguing although somewhat familiar design. Moreover, it’s one that would appear to be eminently suited to island-hopping operations of the kind considered likely in a future large-scale conflict in the Indo-Pacific. Above all else, it shows China's real interest in breaking into the larger tiltrotor realm.

BriteStorm Miniature Electronic Warfare System Can Allow Small Dr...	A new miniature electronic warfare jammer that is relatively low-cost enough to be a payload on loyal wingman-type drones and even expandable loitering munitions has hit the market from defense contractor Leonardo. Focused on stand-in jamming, the BriteStorm payload is based on technology pioneered in the BriteCloud air-launched decoy, which The War Zone has covered in detail in the past. Like its predecessor, BriteStorm can scoop up hostile radar emissions and emulate returns to create large numbers of false and confusing 'ghost' tracks and can also execute more traditional jamming, with even more adaptive capabilities on the horizon. Leonardo, which is headquartered in Italy, officially unveiled BriteStorm at the Association of the U.S. Army's main annual conference, which opened today in Washington, D.C. The company's subsidiary based in the United Kingdom has led the development of the new jammer, as well as the preceding BriteCloud decoy. 'A standard BriteStorm fit incorporates a platform-specific antenna, transmit-receive modules and Leonardo’s Miniature Technique Generator,' according to a press release today from Leonardo. BriteStorm weighs just five and a half pounds (two and a half kilograms), the company also told Breaking Defense. This is small, but still substantially heavier than the soda can-sized BriteCloud, which weighs just over a pound (or half a kilogram). From left to right, examples of a BriteStorm antenna, transmit-receive module, and Miniature Technique Generator. Leonardo 'BriteStorm is platform agnostic&#8230; You can put it on almost anything, as long as it has a payload bay and the power of equivalent of something like a Humvee battery,' Michael Lea, Vice President Of Sales for Electronic Warfare at Leonardo, told The War Zone and other attendees at AUSA. 'And when it comes to price, BriteStorm has been designed to sit at a point that makes it attritable. &#8230; [meaning it] is not prohibitively expensive, and it won't cause a major strategic, strategic issue if lost.' Lea did not further elaborate on cost. BriteStorm is focused on providing stand-in jamming support – which Leonardo defines as an 'airborne electronic warfare capability, deployed ahead of the main force, to deliver high-powered interference against a wide spectrum of threats' – while installed on any of a variety of different platforms. 'By doing so, BriteStorm degrades the enemy’s IADS [integrated air defense system network], supressing its ability to detect and lock onto other platforms, protecting friendly forces and enabling their mission,' according to a company press release. When it comes to how the system works, regardless of what it is installed on, 'BriteStorm is the first stand-in jammer on the market to use the gold-standard digital radio frequency memory, or DRFM, technology, which means it can record the pulse of an enemy radar system perfectly,' Lea added. 'The pulse is then manipulated and projected back, confusing the enemy and significantly degrading their situational awareness.' BriteStorm's DRFM capabilities are based on those found on the BriteCloud decoy, which has been seeing increasing sales worldwide, most recently as a new addition to the F-35 stealth fighter's array of radiofrequency countermeasures. It is worth noting here Leonardo's division in the United Kingdom has also been supplying the electronic warfare payload for the still-in-development stand-in jammer derivative of the Select Precision Effects At Range Capability Three (SPEAR-3) mini-cruise missile from European consortium MBDA. The SPEAR-EW version has been leveraging past work on BriteCloud. 'BriteStorm is highly effective against radars in the NATO A to J bands,' the Leonardo executive continued. 'This means that BriteStorm is effective against all types of&#8230; surveillance, target acquisition, and tracking radars.' As The War Zone has highlighted in the past with regard to BriteCloud, DRFM's signal mimicry can take the form of entire fleets of illusionary targets, not only confusing, but overwhelming radar operators. Integrated onto aerial drones or other uncrewed platforms, the new BriteStorm jammers could also be sent into a target area from multiple different vectors at once, creating additional problems for enemy defenders trying to prioritize their resources. Leonardo says that BriteStorm can also work by using more traditional jamming functionality, 'barraging the enemy system with electronic noise.' A graphic depicting BriteStorm installed on a notional drone. Leonardo As such, BriteStorm jammers could help shield friendly crewed and uncrewed aircraft, as well as cruise missiles, from hostile air defenses, including drawing away surface-to-air missiles from the primary force. Just stimulating the enemy's defenses could help assets tasked with suppression and destruction of enemy air defenses, allowing them to cut a clear path to a target area for incoming strikers. Leonardo's LEA specifically highlighted the U.S. Army's Air Launch Effects (ALE) and Future Tactical Uncrewed Aircraft System (FTUAS) programs, the U.S. Air Force's Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) program, and the United Kingdom's Autonomous Collaborative Platforms (ACP) drone program as ones that the company is now eying as potential opportunities for BriteStorm. Leonardo has three unspecified aerial assets in the United States now that it is using to demonstrate the capability to potential customers. In the United Kingdom, the Royal Air Force's (RAF) Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO) has already taken delivery of several BriteStorm payloads and has conducted some degree of flight testing. Leonardo already conducted at least one test back in 2020 in cooperation with the RAF RCO that involved a group of drones employing BriteCloud decoys against a mock enemy integrated air defense network. A graphic Leonardo released as part of its announcement of the 2020 test. Leonardo 'We're having quite interesting conversations with a number of end users about CONOPS [concepts of operations] for operation of BriteStorm at the moment,' Leonardo's Lea said. 'And I think it's fair to say that in the world of CCA and ACP, coalition forces are trying to work out the right force mix between large, exquisite platforms, uncrewed platforms, and then potential attritable platforms, as well.' In addition, 'BriteStorm is supplied with a very comprehensive mission data and generation tool. And you can observe the effects BriteStorm&#8230; has on opposition radars, and then reprogram it, depending on what you've seen and the threat that's out there,' Michael Lea from Leonardo explained today. 'We are looking again in the capability roadmap, about how you may change the waveforms that BriteStorm can generate by connecting it back to other systems, which are elsewhere.' Responding to a question at the roll-out presentation at AUSA from The War Zone's Jamie Hunter about whether this might mean the system could be reprogrammed on the fly, representatives from Leonardo said the current plan is for any changes to be made in between missions. No mention was made of so-called cognitive electronic warfare capabilities in regard to BriteStorm, but remote updating of systems in the middle of operations to respond to new and evolving threats is a key part of that overall concept. An electronic warfare suite that can process incoming signals and autonomously adjust its outputs to be most effective in response without any outside input is the absolute 'holy grail' that the concept envisions, as you can read more about here. No explicit mention was made today about networking BriteStorms together, but doing so would provide critical additional capability. A networked group of platforms carrying the electronic warfare systems would have synergistic effects. It would make it harder for an opponent to realize they've been deceived and how, with multiple coordinated EW tactics occurring over a broad area and from different vectors and platforms. A grouping like this would also be more resilient to attacks since it would still be able to continue its electronic attacks even if some of the platforms in the network are lost. A graphic depicting BriteStorm installed on different tiers of drones. Leonardo It's interesting to point out here that the U.S. Navy has been pushing ahead in recent years with plans for a similar-sounding distributed and deeply networked electronic warfare ecosystem that includes uncrewed decoys and other nodes capable of mimicking friendly forces to protect them from threats and deceive opponents. The Navy has referred to this concept in the past as the Netted Emulation of Multi-Element Signature against Integrated Sensors, or NEMESIS, which The War Zone was first to really report on. We have highlighted in the past that some of these developments might help explain some number of sightings of so-called unexplained aerial phenomena (UAP). Furthermore, Leonardo's unveiling BriteStorm at the AUSA conference raises the question of whether the system might be usable against target sets beyond enemy air defense networks. Preventing enemy counter-battery radars from getting an accurate fix on artillery units or coastal radars from spotting and tracking ships at sea would also be valuable capabilities to have. More generally, BriteStorm reflects a broad resurgence of demand in the West, especially within the U.S. military, in higher-end electronic warfare capabilities that had increasingly fallen into disuse after decades of counter-terrorism and other lower-intensity missions. American officials now regularly talk about how dominating in the electromagnetic spectrum will be a key factor in succeeding in future high-end fights, such as one in the Pacific against China. The ongoing war in Ukraine has only provided further evidence of the importance of various tiers of electronic warfare capabilities, as well as an important source of more direct lessons learned for the United States and others. How and where BriteStorm may be fielded operationally in the future remains to be seen, but the U.S. military and other armed forces globally have clear and still-growing interest in the kinds of distributed electronic warfare capabilities it has to offer.

Emergency THAAD Deployment To Israel Heightens Concerns On Strain...	Sending one of the U.S. Army’s seven prized Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) batteries to Israel highlights the strain on the service’s air defense systems and personnel, which are increasingly deployed around the globe. This is a glaring issue we explored in-depth nearly a year ago, which you can read about here. Since then, the demand for these systems has only increased, especially now that Israel and Iran are trading escalating blows and as the threat from China looms larger in the Pacific with each passing day. The deteriorating security situation in Europe and Ukraine's massive appetite for air defenses is also a major factor stressing America's organic air defense capacity. While the deployment of the THAAD battery and about 100 soldiers to Israel will not add 'a tremendous amount of additional strain broadly to the community…the air defense artillery community is the most stressed,' Army Secretary Christine Wormuth told reporters Monday, including from The War Zone. 'They have the highest [operational tempo]…and what we are trying to do to manage that is two things.' Lt. Gen. Patrick Frank, U.S. Army Central Commanding General, meets with a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) crew next to a launcher emplaced and prepared to launch interceptors to counter ballistic missile threats at an undisclosed location in the CENTCOM Area of Operations, Dec. 12, 2023. (U.S. Army Courtesy Photo) The first is 'modernizing our integrated air and missile defenses to try to create more capacity,' said Wormuth, speaking at a reporter’s roundtable at the 2024 AUSA Conference in Washington D.C. One step toward that goal is moving toward the integration of the Patriot battery’s new Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS) into the Army’s Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS) network. LTAMDS is designed to provide higher-fidelity sensing capability at much further distances and process a wider array of data more quickly than the Patriot's current radar. It can also offer 360-degree coverage, which the current system cannot. The IBCS connects various sensors to effectors like, gun systems, lasers, missile systems, and electronic warfare capabilities and combines all this data on the entire air defense situation into a single actionable 'picture' for operators. The combination is meant to give air defenders a much greater ability to better react to and if necessary shoot down a multitude of threats at once. 'That will greatly increase the capacity of the existing Patriot force that we have, and that will help reduce some of the stress on our soldiers,' the Secretary explained. Patriot batteries are especially stretched, with the need for training, testing, maintenance and upgrades back at home competing with increasing obligations abroad. The other line of effort is 'constantly trying to be disciplined as we can' in providing inputs to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin so he can 'accurately assess the strain on the force when he's considering future operational deployment. We have to be as choosy as we can be about what we take on.' That is easier said than done, however. In this case, the THAAD battery and troops are being sent to bolster Israel’s defenses as it faces glaringly real ballistic missile threats from Iran and some of the higher-end ballistic missiles Iran has provided Hezbollah. The announcement of its pending delivery comes ahead of an expected Israeli retaliation for Tehran’s massive missile barrage earlier this month. You can see part of that attack in the following video. Dozens of ballistic missile impacts in Israel pic.twitter.com/eGTd0JCBMY&mdash; ELINT News (@ELINTNews) October 1, 2024 'I think we should view this THAAD deployment as for what it is, which is another visible statement of our commitment to the security of Israel…' Wormuth said. A THAAD battery can include up to nine transporter-erector-launchers, each carrying eight interceptors at the ready, as well as a long-range AN/TPY-2 X-band radar, a mobile fire control and command and control center, and various supporting equipment. Additional interceptors would be available to reload the launchers during a combat deployment, as well. A briefing slide showing the general composition of THAAD batteries as of 2016., MDA THAAD is designed to intercept short-, medium, and intermediate-range ballistic missiles during their terminal phase of flight when they are plunging toward their target. The system sits at the top-end of air defense systems capable of terminal phase air defense, which include Patriot, the SM-6, and Israel's Stunner. THAAD can reach up higher and is capable of swatting down faster threats, like longer-range ballistic missiles. The system made its first combat kill in 2020, defending the United Arab Emirates from a ballistic missile launched by Houthi rebels of Yemen. A basic overview of where THAAD fits into the missile defense ecosystem. (MDA) THAADs are in short supply and extremely high demand. In addition to the THAAD battery being sent to Israel, the Army shipped a THAAD battery to the Middle East region shortly after the surprise Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas incursion into southern Israel amid fears that the conflict could erupt into a regional war. In addition, two more are also deployed outside of the continental United States, one in South Korea and one on the U.S. island of Guam in the Western Pacific. THAAD has also been sent on deployments to Europe in recent years. The Army is currently hoping to field an eighth THAAD battery by 2025. This is not the first time THAAD has been sent to Israel. As we reported in March 2019, the first time was part of a Pentagon effort to be able to quickly deploy capabilities and keep adversaries from having too much foreknowledge about U.S. military plans. THAAD's arrival there and the following exercises were very much to prepare for a similar situation as what Israel is facing now and Iran's ballistic missile capabilities have only grown more potent over the last half decade. Though a full THAAD battery was deployed to Israel for the first time five years ago, members of the U.S. Army’s 10th Army Air and Missile Defense Command have maintained the system's long-range AN/TPY-2 X-band radar at a so-called 'cooperative security location' known as Site 512 in Israel’s Negev Desert permanently at least since 2012. This little talked about arrangement means THAAD could deploy without the need to move its staple sensor system there. THAAD seen during its first deployment to Israel in 2019. DoD While Israel faces numerous aerial threats from Hezbollah, the Houthis and various Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and Syria, deploying a THAAD battery at this point seems to be a clear signal to Tehran that not only does the U.S. have Israel’s back, but it is willing to put additional troops and prized materiel on the ground to defend it. The U.S. has been building up capabilities in the region for months now, including other missile defense assets, namely destroyers capable of midcourse intercept of ballistic missiles, in an effort to deter Iran and be better ready to respond should a wider conflict erupt in the region. All that being said, given its capabilities, the THAAD battery would make a prime target for Iran or any of its proxies. But it will also be among the most defended assets in the region and Iran is already fully aware of Israel's strategic missile defense assets and installations. Still, with additional U.S. troops now in harms way, the possibility for a conflict widening if they are harmed is certainly elevated.

North Korea Sending GPS-Equipped Balloons Across The Border	Among the balloons being sent across the border from North Korea to the South are examples carrying GPS transmitters, according to the Republic of Korea military. Waves of excrement and trash-filled balloons have been sent over South Korea since the summer, but the latest development suggests that the North is also using them for limited intelligence-gathering, perhaps in preparation for future contingencies, or to develop more balloon-based military capabilities. The announcement comes only days after Pyongyang accused the South of sending multiple waves of drones over the North Korean capital to drop propaganda leaflets, as you can read about here. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff says that GPS transmitters were found in some of the North Korean balloons. Although it’s unclear when exactly these balloons were sent, there have been no previous reports of them carrying such devices, since the current campaign began. Pieces of garbage (at the bottom of the picture) fall to the ground after a trash-carrying balloon is launched across the border by North Korea in the sky above Seoul on October 4, 2024. Photo by ANTHONY WALLACE / AFP ANTHONY WALLACE A South Korean defense official said the military is 'tracking North Korea’s possible development of balloon flotation technology and preparing for contingencies.' The implication is that North Korea has been using the GPS data sent back by appropriately equipped balloons to study their flight data. A balloon of this kind cannot have its course altered based on returned GPS data, but the equipment could have other implications of varying degrees of impact. Tracking balloon movements over time would show North Korea the kinds of routes they are taking, how far they can travel, and at what speeds. By their nature, the balloons are very likely to be intact once they come down — provided they are not shot down — meaning that the signal can still be transmitted, at least until it descends below the recieving station's horizon. However, if the balloons are brought down by South Korean air defenses, resulting in a sudden loss of connectivity, it’s the resulting data could also help to highlight potential strong and weak spots in the country’s defensive coverage. South Korean soldiers take part in an anti-terror drill, as part of the Ulchi Freedom Shield exercise between the United States and South Korea, in Seoul on August 20, 2024. This was a city-wide civil defense exercise designed to better prepare for any future trash balloons, as well as North Korean drone attacks. Photo by ANTHONY WALLACE / AFP ANTHONY WALLACE Perhaps more significantly, the development could point to North Korea working on other new capabilities for its balloons. The utility of balloons for surveillance was clearly highlighted by a spate of incidents over North America in early 2023, including a high-altitude balloon originating from China. It's a reality TWZ has warned about in great detail before those instances, as well. If North Korea were to fit its balloons with intelligence-gathering equipment, this could provide valuable data. For example, fitting balloons with basic onboard electronic surveillance systems would allow them to send back signatures of air defense systems they detect and their azimuths. While the data might be simple, multiple balloons could allow emissions to be rapidly triangulated, which would help locate air defense radars and other critical nodes, for instance. At the same time, a balloon equipped to send back such data would also generate electromagnetic radiation, revealing its presence and location to electronic surveillance measures, although this can be mitigated to a degree by sending very simple data streams in small bursts and leverage commercial satellite communications is another possibility. A woman passes by the 24-hour Yonhap News TV broadcast at Yongsan Railway Station in Seoul, which displays a news segment featuring a file image of North Korea’s balloons. Photo by Kim Jae-Hwan/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images SOPA Images More worryingly, North Korea may be studying the flight paths of its balloons with a view to providing them with lethal payloads. In the past, we have explored how such balloons could be deadly if filled with explosives, incendiary devices, radioactive materials, or chemical weapons, for example. GPS data, if comprehensive enough, could help North Korea develop tactics for sending balloons to the South with payloads of this kind, too. GPS can also be used to order the release of a balloon-borne weapon over certain predetermined areas. A campaign of this kind would not be accurate, but it would cause mayhem and havoc throughout the South, a primary goal of the North Koreans and something we explored in depth back in 2017. Were Pyongyang to launch a major cross-DMZ conflict, this could be just the kind of tactic that it would look for in combination with deep assaults into the South. Using balloons for lethal attacks is hardly new. Balloons carrying bombs and incendiary devices were a feature of World War II. As we have previously noted, Ukraine today also uses inflatable objects to drop explosives on Russians. The Ukrainian Armed Forces have launched a series of meteorological balloons equipped with explosives deep into Russia for the first time. One of them was intercepted by air defense systems in the Lipetsk region.According to Mash, a modified unmanned aerostat carrying kilograms… pic.twitter.com/0XjfgyzbSd&mdash; MD (@distant_earth83) April 17, 2024 Another option for North Korea would be to use balloons to help overwhelm the South’s formidable air defenses, in times of conflict. This would parallel Russia’s use of balloons with radar reflectors to stimulate, confuse and deplete Ukrainian air defenses. Just the fact that North Korea has displayed increasingly sophisticated use of basic balloons against the South makes them a real threat during a conflict, and thus would suck up precious air defense effectors. This is all in great contrast to North Korea’s balloon campaign up until now. This has involved payloads of trash as well as 'fecal matter and other contaminants.' As such, they have had mainly nuisance value, as well as providing a signal of Pyongyang’s ability to cause disruption in the South using the kinds of ‘gray zone’ tactics that inhabit the space between peace and war. A pedestrian uses a fan to inspect sweet wrappers suspected to be from trash balloons sent from North Korea, in Seoul on July 24, 2024.

This figure reflects the fact that balloons are relatively cheap and simple, making them more attractive for these kinds of operations. Concerns about the possible dangerous payloads have led to South Korea’s military deploying 'chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear response teams and bomb disposal units to collect the objects for a detailed analysis,' according to Yonhap. As far as North Korea is concerned, it has said that its balloon campaign is a response to propaganda balloons launched from the South, activities that have been primarily attributed to activists and North Korean defectors. Such balloons allegedly carry mainly aid parcels and leaflets condemning the North’s leadership. Last week, however, reports emerged of drones being launched from South Korea, apparently with the same purpose. North Korea said that South Korean drones were responsible for scattering a 'huge number' of leaflets with anti-North propaganda over its capital. Officials in Pyongyang described the action as a 'political and military provocation that could lead to armed conflict.' KCNA As TWZ reported at the time, Seoul didn’t admit responsibility for launching the leaflet-dropping drones, although this was a notably sophisticated operation for a group of volunteers or defectors — at least compared to drifting balloons. In particular, the drones would need considerable range, payload, and navigation capabilities to have specifically targeted Pyongyang and to have done so over several nights. At this point, it’s impossible to say whether North Korea’s GPS-equipped balloons are just an experiment or the sign of something more significant in the works. However, it is a useful innovation and may well not be the last we will see, as Pyongyang continues its balloon campaign amid growing tensions on the peninsula.

Experimental Fly-By-Wire UH-60M Black Hawk To Become Autonomy Tes...	An experimental U.S. Army UH-60M helicopter with fly-by-wire flight controls is now set to get a 'robotic brain' that will allow it to operate with a high degree of autonomy with or without any humans on board. This is the latest development in a series of tests stretching back years now that has been steadily working on ever-greater pilot-optional capabilities for the Black Hawk family, which could also find their way onto other aircraft. Sikorsky, now a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin, announced the plan to add its MATRIX autonomy system onto the fly-by-wire UH-60M, also known as the MX, earlier today. The integration is being done under a $6 million contract from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in cooperation with the Army. Sikorsky first began developing MATRIX in 2013 and then further evolved the system as part of DARPA's Aircrew Labor In-Cockpit Automation System (ALIAS) program starting in 2014. The ALIAS/MATRIX autonomy package has already been demonstrated on a Sikorsky fly-by-wire pilot-optional UH-60A testbed, as well as an S-76 helicopter and a fixed-wing Cessna C-208 Caravan. 'As part of ALIAS in 2020, Sikorsky provided the hardware and engineering support to add fly-by-wire flight controls to the [UH-60M] MX aircraft,' according to a press release Lockheed Martin put out today. 'When combined with the MATRIX autonomy system, the MX aircraft will be a near-exact copy of Sikorsky’s UH-60A fly-by-wire Optionally Piloted Black Hawk helicopter, the company’s flying lab that has tested MATRIX autonomy over hundreds of flight hours.' 'The [ALIAS/MATRIX equipped MX] aircraft will enable DEVCOM to explore and mature the practical applications and potential concept of operations of a scalable autonomy system,' the release adds. 'Evaluation will include assessment of different sensor suites to perceive and avoid threats, obstacles and terrain, and develop standards and system specifications interfaced with the MATRIX system and a fly-by-wire flight control system.' The integration of ALIAS/MATRIX onto the MX Black Hawk is set to be completed next year. 'We're going to have a tablet. You push a button, and it'll go through all the pre-flight checks, it'll start, it'll take off, and perform that [assigned] mission,' Dan Tenney, Vice President, Strategy and Business Development for Lockheed Martin for Rotary and Mission Systems, also said today in explaining the current capabilities of the ALIAS/MATRIX system. 'And we're not talking about remote control. We're not talking about programmed waypoints. We're actually talking about putting a mission into the aircraft and allowing it to perform. ' Test pilots control an ALIAS/MATRIX-equipped UH-60A Black Hawk with a tablet interface during a previous test flight. Lockheed Martin 'Now the autonomy comes in of truly saying this is the mission we want you to perform,' he continued. 'And then when the aircraft goes through algorithms and says, this is the best way to perform that mission, and adjusts.' Tenney was talking to Defense News' Sebastian Sprenger in a live interview from the floor of the Association of the U.S. Army's (AUSA) main annual convention in Washington, D.C., which opened today, which The War Zone and other attendees listened in on. This high degree of autonomy 'becomes extremely important as you can think about supplementing a pilot. You know, if you have a pilot flying and there's other mission objectives they need to be working on, they can autonomously fly the aircraft [using ALIAS/MATRIX] – not just an autopilot, but actually tell it to do the mission,' Tenney added. 'It'll adjust because of weather, it'll adjust because of geography or threats that are out there that are being detected through sensors and space capabilities. And so you can also then send in other signals and how to go perform a different mission.' When it comes to the Black Hawk family specifically, the addition of digital fly-by-wire control systems is key to this next step in pilot-optional capabilities. 'So when we're fly-by-wire and we take out many of the mechanical linkages, we can then have crewed-uncrewed [capabilities], we can add autonomy into those systems, but you don't have to change the entire structure [of the aircraft],' Tenny explained. Sikorsky plans to conduct a new demonstration of ALIAS/MATRIX's capabilities as part of AUSA utilizing the existing UH-60A test helicopter, which will fly from the company's facility in Stratford, Connecticut under remote direction from the show floor. As The War Zone has highlighted in our reporting on ALIAS/MATRIX in the past, the capabilities the system offers open up valuable new avenues for the Army, as well as others, for operating existing helicopters like the Black Hawk series, while also limiting risks to pilots and other aircrew. 'So let's say you have a Black Hawk flying in theater, and you have troops on the ground that need an emergency MEDEVAC [medical evacuation], or an event like that. They could send a message to the Black Hawk, and the Black Hawk could reroute [automatically],' Lockheed Martin's Tenney offered as an example for the floor of AUSA. 'Now they'd have to have the right parameters to do that, okay, but they would send it. The Black Hawk would accept that mission, turn around, find the best place to land, and perform it.' Previous ALIAS/MATRIX testing has focused heavily on highly autonomous medical evacuation and resupply missions, including one instance in which the existing UH-60A testbed delivered real and simulated blood to a forward location. New ways to get key supplies to forward forces and otherwise operate critical logistics chains in contested environments are areas of significant interest to the Army, as well as the rest of the U.S. military, as part of planning now for future high-end fights, especially one across the broad expanses of the Pacific against China. The ability to rapidly switch between crewed and uncrewed operations would also give commanders more flexibility for conducting operations in both higher and lower-risk environments. Being able to position and reposition UH-60s from one location to another without the need for human flight crews could be just as valuable from a resource management perspective as having the option to send one into a more dangerous locale without risking real human personnel. Acting as an artificial intelligence-driven co-pilot, ALIAS/MATRIX could also just help provide extra margins of flight safety during crewed operations. 'Autonomy-enabled aircraft will reduce pilot workload, dramatically improve flight safety, and give battle commanders the flexibility to perform complex missions in contested and congested battlespace, day or night in all weather conditions,' Rich Benton, Sikorsky Vice President and General Manager, said in a statement today. 'Soldiers will rely on Black Hawk helicopters into the 2070s, and modernizing the aircraft today will pay dividends for decades across Army Aviation’s current and future aircraft.' The Army is also pursuing next-generation aviation capabilities, including the tilt-rotor Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) that is set to supplant a significant portion of the service's UH-60s, which could also benefit from the ALIAS/MATRIX developments. As already mentioned, the autonomy package has been tested on other helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft already. What comes out of continued work on ALIAS/MATRIX could be of interest outside of the Army, as well. Contested logistics chains, in particular, are a major area of concern facing the entire U.S. military. Other branches are also actively looking at uncrewed aerial and other capabilities as ways to ensure forces, especially ones dispersed to far-flung locations to help reduce their vulnerability, can be adequately resupplied in the future. China, the United States' principal global competitor, is facing the prospect of future military operations with the same kinds of logistical demands and has been notably pushing ahead in its own development of uncrewed aerial cargo aircraft. It is important to note that questions have been and continue to be raised about the true extent of developments in the autonomy arena, especially when it comes to uncrewed aircraft. U.S. military and industry officials have repeatedly stressed that work in this regard is progressing along incremental approaches and that building operator trust in autonomous capabilities remains central to these developments. 'The first time that you give not a not good answer, a really bad answer to a user, they will never trust that system, that box, or potentially use a deliverer [company supplying the system], ever again,' Dr. Alex Miller, Chief Technology Officer for the Chief of Staff of the Army, said during a virtual roundtable discussion on artificial intelligence and related technologies that the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS) think tank hosted back in September. 'And it's not because you're bad at your job, or the system's bad, it's because they don't want to spend more time being paranoid, double-checking the answers, because of one bad experience.' All of this points to the importance of the continued testing of ALIAS/MATRIX, which is now set to involve the MX Black Hawk, as the Army, DARPA, and Sikosrky move further ahead in pushing toward real operational autonomous capabilities for the UH-60 family and potentially other aircraft.

Navy Just Reloaded A Vertical Launch System For The First Time Wh...	One of the largest concerns regarding the U.S. Navy's ability to persist in a peer conflict in the vast Pacific is the ability to keep its prized major surface combatants — destroyers, cruisers and soon frigates — stocked with weapons. The conflict with the Houthis in and around the Red Sea has only underscored the need to figure out how to reload vertical launch systems (VLS) without coming into port. If an Iranian-backed rebel group can make a big dent in American warships' weapons stocks, China would be exponentially worse. You can read all about this glaring issue in our previous feature here. But now, the Navy has just demonstrated its fast-tracked possible solution to this pressing issue. USS Chosin (CG-65), a Ticonderoga class cruiser, came alongside Military Sealift Command's dry cargo ship USNS Washington Chambers (T-AKE 11) and transferred an empty VLS weapon container to the cruiser while sailing off the southern California coast on October 11th. The demonstration included USS Chosin and USNS Washington Chambers as participants. (USN/Composite) The device designed for this critical application is the Transferrable Reload At-sea Method or 'TRAM.' During the test, a U.S. Navy press release states: 'The sailors then used TRAM to move the missile canister along rails attached to the cruiser’s VLS modules, tilt it into a vertical position, and lower it into a VLS cell with TRAM’s built-in cable and pulley system&#8230; The successful demonstration marks a critical step in the capability to rearm warships at sea—a top priority outlined by Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro.' The Secretary of the Navy, who was in attendance to watch the test, declared it a huge success. 'Today, we proved just how game-changing TRAM truly is—and what a powerful deterrent it will be to our competitors&#8230;,' he said. 'This demonstration marks a key milestone on the path to perfecting this capability and fielding it for sustained operations at sea.' Del Toro watches TRAM in action during the test. (USN) This demonstration was highly-anticipated, with Congress taking a major interest in the capability. A pier-side trial at Naval Surface Warfare Center Port Hueneme Division, which also developed the system, was successful in July, but doing it at sea was a big leap in terms of complexity. The hydraulically-powered TRAM system can be used while the ship is executing underway replenishment, which is a regular but demanding task, where all types of supplies are moved from a supply ship to a warship while moving parallel to one another. If TRAM proves fully successful and is fielded to the fleet, it means that Mk 41 Vertical Launch System weapons cells can also be replenished during these operations. Sailors from the Navy Expeditionary Logistics Support Group and USS Chosin (CG 65) prepare to operate the U.S. Navy’s Transferrable Rearming Mechanism as they demonstrate reloading a MK 41 Vertical Launching System cell on July 10 at Naval Surface Warfare Center, Port Hueneme Division’s Underway Replenishment Test Site.

(U.S. Navy photo/released) Getting this system into a deployable state is of utmost importance as the threat from China looms larger by the day. During a conflict in the Pacific, just the size of the theater will make resupplying highly dispersed warships very challenging, let alone the danger these vessels will be in. But the volume of fire that could occur in such a conflict could quickly leave America's most powerful warships without certain types of missiles in their VLS cells. This is especially concerning when it comes to weapons that are critical to defending the ships themselves. Ports capable of VLS resupply could be thousands of miles away from patrol areas and they too could be at risk of attack. On top of this, the U.S. Navy is finding it very challenging to meet its surface combatant hull goals of the future. Each ship that is operational at the time of the conflict will be very valuable and keeping them on scene longer will be critical to achieving overall military objectives. TRAM is supposed to go a long way in helping with these issues, although having enough ships to execute underway replenishment in such a huge theater, even with potential combat losses, is another issue entirely. As it sits now, Secretary Del Toro says the Navy is on track to begin fielding TRAM operationally in two to three years.

Drones Penetrate North Korean Air Defenses To Drop Propaganda Lea...	North Korea has accused South Korea of using drones to scatter propaganda leaflets over its capital, Pyongyang. The incident today comes after waves of excrement and trash-filled balloons launched by North Korea into the South, which started this summer, and during a period of overall worsening tensions on the peninsula overall. KCNA Photos released by the North Korean state news agency KCNA are of fairly poor quality, but appear to show triangular objects, perhaps broadly similar in configuration to the Israeli Harop long-range one-way attack drone. Other views suggest not so much a delta-wing platform as a swept-winged one, reminiscent of the U.S.-made ScanEagle long-endurance, low-altitude drone. It could also be the case that a variety of different drones were used for the airdrop mission. ScanEagle? pic.twitter.com/Qn5d3REYZe&mdash; JSF (@rockfish31) October 11, 2024 These drones, in turn, are shown seemingly releasing small objects. The news agency describes these objects as 'scattered leaflets,' or as 'bundles of leaflets.' KCNA KCNA A separate photo shows a close-up of what’s claimed to be one of the drone-delivered leaflets. The black, yellow, and white leaflets compare the economic situation in the South to that in the North and also criticize North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. KCNA North Korea said that South Korean drones were responsible for scattering a 'huge number' of leaflets with anti-North propaganda over its capital. Officials in Pyongyang described the action as a 'political and military provocation that could lead to armed conflict.' According to the North Korean Foreign Ministry, the drone incursions occurred on several nights this week — October 3, 9, and 10 — each time penetrating airspace over Pyongyang. The North Korean Foreign Ministry today said that the latest incursion demanded retaliatory action, according to KCNA. 'The ROK [South Korea] should immediately stop such irresponsible and dangerous provocation that may cause an armed conflict and lead to a war between the two sides,' the ministry was quoted as saying. The has issued a strongly worded statement to the South, saying there will be no more warnings and the North will immediately take action if another drone is sent from the South over its territory. Meanwhile, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said they could not confirm the North’s accusations. They did, however, bring up the North Korean practice of sending balloons into South Korean airspace. Since the summer of this year, North Korea has sent hundreds of balloons, many filled with trash, into South Korea. via X The Joint Chiefs of Staff said they 'cannot confirm the truth of North Korea’s claims,' but added that 'All responsibility for the recent series of events' lies with the North. South Korea said that more balloons were launched toward its airspace today, citing this as more evidence of the North’s 'despicable, low-grade and internationally embarrassing acts of filth and garbage balloons and other provocations.' The North Korean balloon campaign began in May of this year and has so far seen thousands of balloons drift into the South’s airspace. 'There’s a Sh*t cloud Coming!': Pyongyang sends over 200 balloons filled with trash, excrement to South KoreaSeveral balloons crossed the border and fell in various locations across South Korea from Tuesday night to Wednesday, scattering waste and manure on the ground,… pic.twitter.com/1rMlYomnGW&mdash; Monitor𝕏 (@MonitorX99800) May 29, 2024 North Korea has admitted responsibility for the balloons but argues that these are a response to balloons launched from the South by activists and North Korean defectors in South Korea. The balloons from the South allegedly carry mainly aid parcels and leaflets condemning the North’s leadership. It may be the case that the drones were also sent by activists or defectors, but this would be a very sophisticated operation for groups of volunteers — at least compared to drifting balloons. In particular, the drones would need considerable range, payload and navigation capabilities to have specifically targeted Pyongyang, and to have done so over several nights. An official at the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff has said that there needs to be an investigation into whether the drones were sent into the North by a private group, according to a report from South Korea’s Yonhap news agency. In the past, we looked at how the North Korean balloon campaign demonstrated the potential for craft of this type to also be used to deliver deadly payloads, such as explosives, incendiary devices, radioactive materials, or chemical weapons. When the campaign began earlier this year, South Korea’s military reportedly deployed 'chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear response teams and bomb disposal units to collect the objects for a detailed analysis.' The same concerns, of course, apply to drones. The ability of drones — sophisticated or otherwise — to penetrate the heavily defended airspace over the North Korean capital will surely be a considerable worry to officials there and would appear to highlight deficiencies in the North’s best air defense coverage. As with the balloons from the North, the drones over Pyongyang don’t appear to have caused any major damage or contained anything dangerous, but the event will still have been alarming for the North — evidenced by the ferocity of its official statement in response.

Photo by Kim Jae-Hwan/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images SOPA Images Furthermore, while balloons are far from a precision threat and provide more of an annoyance than anything else, drones are very different. As TWZ has discussed for years, a drone that’s able to deliver a lethal payload or long distances, for example, with considerable accuracy is now well within the reach of non-state actors. At this stage, it remains unclear whether the drones in question were launched by private organizations or if they originated from the South Korean military or government, or if they were the result of a more shadowy ‘hybrid warfare’ effort. Provided the drones were not launched from the sea, Seoul should've been able to detect them fairly easily and know where they came from, raising questions about the theory of a non-state origin. Were the drones launched across the land border, they would also have to pass through some of the most heavily surveilled and best-defended airspace on the planet. A government operation seems far more likely, considering these were fairly sophisticated drones, able to fly long distances before dropping their payloads. South Korea certainly has drones with the capability and North Korea does too, as they increasingly invest in more advanced unmanned aircraft.

There is even a slim possibility that North Korea orchestrated the drone campaign, for whatever reason. North Korea has a track record of launching its own drones against the South. In December 2022, a North Korean drone entered a no-fly zone around the office of the South Korean president, according to military officials in Seoul. In response to this and earlier incursions, the South stepped up its anti-drone capabilities, including developing airborne laser weapons and signal jammers. In the meantime, the armed forces use aircraft, including KA-1 fixed-wing turboprops and MD500 helicopters, as well as soldiers armed with anti-drone jammer guns, to counter drones from the North. The truth is the North's drone incursions over the South go back many years. The wreckage of a crashed drone — believed to be from North Korea — seen on Baengnyeong Island, a border island between South Korea and North Korea on March 31, 2014. Photo by South Korean Defence Ministry via Getty Images Handout With the two Koreas still technically at war, and with officials from both countries already locked in a hyperbolic war of words. Just a few days ago, the North said it would sever road and railway access to the South, to make sure the two countries are 'completely separate.' Incidents like this also raise tensions and, with them, the risk of an overreaction or a misunderstanding leading to a much more serious escalation. The latest incursion is perhaps particularly concerning bearing in mind that a military campaign launched by the South against its neighbor would very likely also see extensive involvement by drones, including to confuse and overwhelm air defenses. This would be especially relevant ahead of any air campaign directed against Pyongyang, such as decapitation strikes against the leadership. With that in mind, it’s possible that the drones were also intended to serve as a warning from the South — whether sanctioned by official channels or not, or even some kind of trial run. Pyongyang’s angry response is predictable, but it remains to be seen exactly what kind of reaction will be prompted by any further such drone incursions.

Counter-Drone Stryker Armored Vehicle Armed With Lasers, Rockets,...	A new counter-drone focused variant of the 8&#215;8 Stryker light armored vehicle armed with a laser directed energy weapon, laser-guided 70mm rockets, a 30mm automatic cannon, radars and other sensors has broken cover. Defense contractor Leonardo DRS and its industry partners are actively pitching the vehicle to the U.S. Army, which is looking to significantly grow its short-range air defense capabilities in the coming years. That service is also very interested in new laser-armed options, specifically, after lackluster field tests of a different Stryker-based system earlier this year. Leonardo DRS, the U.S.-based subsidiary of Italy's Leonardo, released a video, seen below, detailing what it is currently calling the Counter-Uncrewed Aerial Systems Directed Energy (C-UAS DE) Stryker earlier today. The company says seven other partners – BlueHalo, EOS Defense Systems USA, Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems, Arnold Defense, AMPEX, and Digital Systems Engineering – contributed to the development of the prototype in around eight months. The laser directed energy weapon, a 26-kilowatt version of the LOCUST from BlueHalo installed on a retractable mount on top of the rear of the hull, is clearly the centerpiece of the new counter-drone Stryker prototype. 'It's going to provide a directed energy capability that can kill group ones, twos, three UASs at very long range,' Ed House Senior Director of Business Development at Leonardo DRS says in the video. Per the U.S. military's definitions, drones in these three categories, collectively, can weigh up to 1,320 pounds, fly at altitudes up to 18,000 feet, and get up to top speeds of 250 knots. BlueHalo does not appear to have disclosed a maximum engagement range for the LOCUST. Screen captures showing quadcopter-type drones being destroyed by the LOCUST on the C-UAS DE Stryker during testing.

Leonardo DRS capture The C-UAS DE Stryker also has a four-round launcher from Arnold Defense for 70mm laser-guided Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II (APKWS II) rockets on a semi-retractable mount on top of the left side of the rear of the hull. This is a combination that is found on other counter-drone systems, including L3Harris VAMPIREs now being actively employed in Ukraine. APWKS II rockets with new proximity-fuzed warheads optimized for knocking down uncrewed aircraft are in the works.

The XM914 is another increasingly common feature in counter-drone systems and can now fire proximity-fuzed shells, further increasing its effectiveness in this role. The cannon's manufacturer Northrop Grumman just recently rolled out a new dual-feed system that allows operators to remotely switch between two ammunition types, such as the proximity rounds and ones better suited for use against targets on the ground. A picture of an XM914 configured with the new dual-feed system. Northrop Grumman BlueHalo has also supplied a Titan SV system for the new Stryker prototype, which is a radiofrequency sensor to help detect and track hostile drones. In addition, the vehicle also has Next-Gen Multi-Mission Hemispheric Radars (nMHR), which are small form factor active electronically scanned array (AESA) types, as well as a 360-degree array of cameras, to help spot, classify and track targets. The promotional video labels another antenna at the rear as an 'HMS,' but it is not immediately clear what that system is. An annotated image of the C-UAS DE Stryker Leonardo DRS capture No explicit mention is made in the video about networking capabilities, but being able to feed in targeting data from off-board sources, including other C-UAS DE Strykers, and/or share the information that its sensor suite is collecting with other assets would make good sense. Still, it is 'this directed energy [that] gives commanders options. It increases the stowed kills [magazine depth] available to a unit commander, and this is technology that's available to the warfighter today,' House stresses in the video. 'You can see we're out in the desert in New Mexico now. We've shot several drones down with the laser weapon system.' Functionally unlimited magazine depth, which Leonardo DRS' House refers to in the video, is regularly cited as a key benefit of laser directed energy weapons, as well as high-power microwave types, when compared to traditional guns or surface-to-air missiles. There is also some amount of cool down/recharge time between 'shots,' but each engagement costs dollars rather than the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars compared to more traditional surface-to-air interceptors. Firing traditional guns can be costly, as well. Lasers are not without pitfalls, however. In general, they are sensitive to smoke, clouds, rain, and other environmental factors that can disrupt the beam and reduce its effectiveness. The beam's power also drops the further away it gets from the source. Directed energy weapons often come along with substantial power generation and cooling requirements, as well. Though the technology has advanced by leaps and bounds in the last decade, U.S. military laser directed energy weapon programs, in particular, have been experiencing new and significant reality checks in the past year or so. This includes issues uncovered with another Stryker variant the Army has been acquiring already, called the Directed Energy Maneuver-Short Range Air Defense (DE M-SHORAD), which is armed with a 50-kilowatt laser weapon from Raytheon. Four of those vehicles were deployed to the Middle East for a field test in March, according to Breaking Defense. One of the Army’s initial prototype DE M-SHORAD vehicles. US Army One of the Army's initial prototype DE M-SHORAD vehicles. US Army 'What we’re finding is where the challenges are with directed energy at different power levels,' Dough Bush, Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology, told members of Congress in May, per Breaking Defense. 'That [50-kilowatt] power level is proving challenging to incorporate into a vehicle that has to move around constantly – the heat dissipation, the amount of electronics, kind of the wear and tear of a vehicle in a tactical environment versus a fixed site.' At that time, Bush that 'some' unspecified users were seeing other laser weapons emplaced at fixed sites 'proving successful.' The Army Assistant Secretary did not name those systems. It is worth noting here that the service has already procured at least two 20-kilowatt LOCUST variants, called Palletized High Energy Lasers (P-HEL), and sent them overseas for limited field testing. The BlueHalo LOCUST laser weapon system. BlueHalo 'We’ve worked with industry to increase reliability across a number of those systems,' Army Lt. Gen. Robert Rasch, head of the service's Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office (RCCTO), said in a more recent interview with Breaking Defense in August. 'For the enduring high-energy laser, we believe — based on what we’ve seen and collected data – that industry is ready to produce systems that can reach the reliability levels and the affordability levels, to get in that group one through three UAS range.' This certainly seems to be what Leonardo DRS and its partners are aiming for now with the new C-UAS DE Stryker. 'What this shows is when industry works together we can help the army solve problems, and, in this case, we're moving directed energy forward for the Army,' Leonardo DRS' House says in the video released today. The Army is in the midst of a larger push to expand and modernize its air defense capabilities, especially shorter-range systems, and with a heavy focus on defeating drones. In addition to the DE M-SHORAD Stryker, the Army has also been fielding a baseline M-SHORAD Stryker variant, now named the Sgt. Stout, which is armed with a combination of Stinger heat-seeking short-range surface-to-air missiles, radar-guided AGM-114L Hellfire missiles, and an XM914 cannon, as well as an array of small AESA radars. Sgt. Mitchell William Stout gave his life during the Vietnam War protecting his fellow soldiers from a grenade and was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. The original M-SHORAD vehicle and the DE M-SHORAD are also known as Increments 1 and 2 of the overall M-SHORAD program. Increment 3 is focused on integrating a replacement for the venerable Stinger, which you can read more about here, into the family of the systems. Increment 4, the requirements for which the Army publicly laid out in May, calls for a new, lighter system that can be air-dropped or lifted by helicopters to better support airborne and airmobile operations. The Army has said that the Increment 4 system could be fitted to a 4&#215;4 Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV), an uncrewed ground vehicle, or a combination of both depending on the exact configuration of the components. The future Stinger replacement, Raytheon's Coyote counter-drone interceptor, APKWS II, and the XM914 have all been presented as possible armament options. The idea of porting over the Incerment 1 M-SHORAD system onto a variant of the tracked Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) has also been discussed. The Army has also been eying a Sytryker equipped with a high-power microwave directed energy weapon for use against drones. A SHORAD-configured AMPV.

GDLS Beyond M-SHORAD, the Army also has a growing force of Mobile, Low, Slow, Unmanned Aircraft Integrated Defeat System (M-LIDS). M-LIDS currently consists of various components, including Coyote interceptors and XM914 cannons, as well as electronic warfare systems and sensors, split between a pair of 4&#215;4 M-ATV mine-resistant light tactical vehicles. The service is now moving to consolidate M-LIDS onto a single Stryker. This, in turn, is causing the line between the dedicated counter-drone M-LIDS and the broader short-range air-defense-focused M-SHORAD efforts to become increasingly blurred.

Leonardo DRS Threats posed by drones, including weaponized commercial types, are not new, as The War Zone regularly highlights. However, the ongoing war in Ukraine has been central to a clearer understanding of these issues finally entering the mainstream discourse. The regular use of various tiers of drones by both sides of that conflict has caused an explosion in demand for new and improved capabilities to destroy or at least disrupt uncrewed aerial threats. The need now to defend tanks and other armored vehicles against drones, especially highly maneuverable first-person view (FPV) kamikaze types, has become particularly visible. On-vehicle capabilities and ones that can be used on the move are increasingly critical, as you can read more about in these past features.

Its worth pointing out here that high-power microwaves offer advantages over lasers when it comes to engaging swarms. Swarming and other capabilities, further enabled by advances in artificial intelligence, are pushing drones, in general, toward a major new evolutionary, if not revolutionary moment. Increasingly more capable uncrewed aerial systems are set to continue proliferating globally, too. At the same time, the barrier to entry when it comes to acquiring and employing weaponized commercial drones, which can still be very threatening, remains extremely low. This is a reality that is not lost on other branches of the U.S. military beyond the Army. In terms of ground-based systems, the U.S. Marine Corps is also particularly active on this front. That service has plans now to at least test a LOCUST-equipped JLTV of its own, as well as a high power microwave system one of those 4&#215;4 vehicles can tow in a trailer. Still, despite the obvious flurry of activity, the Army, as well as the rest of the U.S. military, continue to very much lag behind in their efforts to actually field various tiers of anti-drone defenses. This was underscored just recently by the appearance of an apparent Chinese-made laser directed energy weapon that is similar in some respects to the LOCUST, at least on paper, in actual use in the Iranian capital Tehran along with other new counter-drone capabilities. The actual capabilities that system offers are unclear, but it does highlight the active work that is going on in this arena now outside of the United States, especially in China. As already noted, the Army, especially, is trying now to really push forward with dramatic expansion of its air defense and counter-drone capabilities and capacity. Time will tell, but C-UAS DE Stryker, or a similar configuration, could well be part of that future ecosystem.

France’s Radical-Looking New Frigate Has Gone To Sea	The French Navy’s remarkable-looking new frigate, the Amiral Ronarc’h, is quickly winning plaudits on account of its rakish good looks. But the warship — the first of a new class of so-called defense and intervention frigates — is not just noteworthy on account of its striking visual appearance. It’s also a very interesting study of how to pack a considerable number of weapons and sensors onto a relatively small hull and operate them with a limited crew complement. The Amiral Ronarc’h sets out for sea trials on October 7. DGA DGA The Amiral Ronarc’h (hull number D 660) officially started sea trials earlier this week, setting sail from the Naval Group’s Lorient shipyard, in Brittany, western France, on October 7. In French parlance, the new warship is the first of a new class of Frégate de Défense et d’Intervention (FDI), or defense and intervention frigate. The Amiral Ronarc’h is the first of five FDI frigates being built by Naval Group for the French Navy under a contract awarded in 2017. Construction of the lead ship began in 2019, it was laid down in December 2021, and launched in November 2022. A photograph taken in December 2021 shows a part of the first FDI frigate during the laying down ceremony in Lorient. Photo by SEBASTIEN SALOM-GOMIS/AFP via Getty Images SEBASTIEN SALOM-GOMIS The second FDI for the French Navy, the Amiral Louzeau (D 661), started construction in July 2023. The French Navy’s third FDI, the Amiral Castex (D 662), is also now under construction. The Amiral Ronarc’h under construction in Lorient, in December 2022. KRaikkonen01/Wikimedia Commons In the meantime, another three vessels in the FDI family are also being built. These were ordered by Greece in 2022 (with an option for a fourth) and are required under a more compressed timeline. They are also somewhat different, including being more heavily armed, as we will discuss later. For now, however, the spotlight is very much on the Amiral Ronarc’h, with imagery of this warship receiving much interest as it goes to sea for the first time. The new frigate looks very different from almost every other surface combatant currently in service. The most prominent feature is the wave-piercing knife-like bow, which gives an appearance reminiscent of the design configuration known as a reverse bow, or inverted bow. There is also a dramatic chine that extends from the bow along the entire hull line. One of the first photos of the Amiral Ronarc’h during at-sea trials. Naval Group The French Navy’s FDIs will each have a displacement of around 4,960 tons. These warships are 400 feet long, have a beam of 59 feet, and will be capable of speeds of 27 knots, driven by a combined diesel and diesel (CODAD) propulsion arrangement. They will have an at-sea endurance of 45 days. They will typically be operated by a crew of 125, with provision to embark 28 additional personnel if required for certain missions. Naval Group describes these innovative vessels as 'bringing together the best of French naval technologies on a compact platform,' with the resulting warships being 'designed to cope with constantly evolving threats.' A computer-generated image of a replenishment at sea (RAS) of the frigate Amiral Cabanier. French Navy The vessels were designed and are being produced using digital tools, while an onboard digital architecture will ensure that they can be modified and upgraded to keep up with those threats, as Naval Group contends. 'The FDIs will be able to deal with current and future high-spectrum threats, with 360-degree coverage in all frequency bands, and process an ever-increasing amount of data,' the manufacturer claims. To deal with those threats, the French Navy’s FDIs are notably well armed, with a variety of weapons allowing them to undertake missions including anti-ship, anti-air, anti-submarine, and special forces projection, as well as dealing with asymmetric threats. For anti-ship missions, the French FDIs will be armed with eight Exocet MM40 missiles, in the latest B3C version. Able to hit targets at a range of around 124 miles, the Exocet MM40 flies at very low altitudes and at high subsonic speeds. It has an active radar seeker and the B3C model introduces a new navigation and propulsion package. The navigation system allows for the programming of 3D waypoints, optimized trajectories, and simultaneous terminal attacks involving multiple missiles. The primary anti-air weapon is the Aster surface-to-air missile, 16 of which are carried in a pair of eight-cell launchers. Combat-proven, the Aster is available in two main versions. The smaller Aster 15 has a range of around 18 miles, while the larger Aster 30 is able to engage targets at more than 75 miles. Recent improvements to the Aster 30 include enhancing its capabilities against anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBMs), a relatively new type of threat that is being employed by the Houthis in their campaign against shipping in the Red Sea. A computer-generated image of an Aster 30 launch from the frigate Amiral Cabanier. French Navy MU90 torpedoes, in two dual tubes, are available for anti-submarine warfare. The vessels are also equipped with guns of various calibers, including a 76mm Oto Melara Super Rapid main gun and a pair of Narwhal 20mm remote weapon stations. Aviation options include a helicopter, such as the Caïman Marine (a version of the NATO Frigate Helicopter, NFH), the future Guépard Marine, and/or a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) drone, with a hangar bay and stern landing area. A computer-generated image of the Amiral Cabanier accompanied by a Guépard Marine, and a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) drone. French Navy Two commando boats can also be embarked to deploy raiding teams, special forces, and for force protection and minor logistics. The comprehensive sensor suite includes the new-generation Thales Sea Fire radar with four fixed arrays, mounted on the prominent pyramidal mast. The FDIs are also the first French warships of their kind to be protected against cyber threats from the outset. This includes a redundant IT architecture based around two data centers. A tug moves the Amiral Ronarc’h out of port for its first at-sea trials. Naval Group The design is also tailored to be more resilient to other novel and emerging threats. 'In terms of operational innovation, the FDI is inaugurating the concept of a gateway dedicated to combating asymmetric threats. This system will make it possible to coordinate and lead the fight against small, close air and surface threats, in particular booby-trapped craft,' Naval Group has said. The sea trials for the Amiral Ronarc’h are planned to be especially comprehensive, involving not only testing of the navigation and propulsion systems but also the various combat systems, which will be put their paces in real-life conditions at sea. Feedback from these trials will also help refine the forthcoming vessels in the FDI program as well as paving the way for the Amiral Ronarc’h to enter service, planned for 2025. The four remaining frigates for the French Navy are all scheduled to be delivered by 2030. This is despite some delays in the program, since the first sea trials for the Amiral Ronarc’h were originally planned for 2023, followed by delivery in 2024. A computer-generated image of a fleet tanker performing an underway replenishment simultaneously with the next-generation French Navy aircraft carrier and an FDI frigate. French Navy Once in service, the five FDI frigates will supplement the eight FREMM-type frigates, and will eventually supersede the five La Fayette class frigates, with the last of these scheduled to be withdrawn in 2035. Greece’s Hellenic Navy, meanwhile, is slated to receive two FDI frigates in 2025 and one in 2026. To meet the timeline, the second and third hulls originally planned to be delivered to the French Navy are instead being completed for the Hellenic Navy, which refers to them as the Kimon class. The first two Greek frigates, Kimon and Nearchos, were launched in October 2023 and September 2024 respectively. The reported cost of the Greek program is $3.5 billion, for the first three vessels. The Greek ships demonstrate the capacity for growth in the FDI design, with these warships featuring heavier armament. They feature three rather than two eight-cell Aster launchers, for a total of 24 Aster 15/30 missiles, with further air defense missiles provided in the form of a 21-cell Mk 31 launcher for the Rolling Airframe Missile Block 2B, to tackle close-in threats. The Kimon class also adds a land attack capability, with an eight-cell launcher for the Missile de Croisière Naval (MdCN), meaning Naval Cruise Missile. The MdCN is a maritime version of the air-launched SCALP/Storm Shadow and allows conventional attacks on high-value targets at a range of 'several hundred kilometers,' according to French sources. Other weapons changes include the Leonardo Lionfish 20mm remote weapon stations in place of the Narwhal on the French hulls. Naval Group plans to ramp up production to deliver two ships per year starting in 2025. Offering a useful blend of capabilities, via advanced weapons and sensors, and with a significant degree for future modernization, as well as different equipment options, it would not be a surprise of the FDI design wins more export orders in the future.

Search For Barrett .50 Caliber Sniper Rifle Replacement Halted By...	U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) is no longer looking for a new heavyweight sniper/anti-materiel rifle, at least for now. The Extreme Long Range Sniper Rifle (ELR-SR) effort had been seeking possible successors to the famed Barrett M82 family of .50 caliber semi-automatic rifles, as well as lesser-known bolt-action McMillan Mk 15s in the same caliber. A US Marine fires a Barrett .50 caliber M82-series semi-automatic rifle in training. USMC SOCOM quietly announced it was shelving the ELR-SR project back on September 26. 'At the moment, we are not moving forward with this effort,' the command said in a brief contracting notice. 'We appreciate your interest and hard work in responding to this RFI [request for information],' the notice added. 'Due to changing priorities, we are pursuing other efforts.' No further details were provided. The War Zone has reached out to SOCOM for more information. SOCOM's Special Operations Forces Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics Center (SOF AT&L) first publicly laid out requirements for the ELR-SR last December. This included demands for the new weapon to be a bolt-action design and be consistently effective out to a range of at least 2,500 meters [approximately 2,734 yards] – greater than the stated effective range of M82 series rifles (including modernized M107 variants) or the Mk 15. The new rifle also had to be shorter and lighter than the existing .50 caliber types. A Naval Special Warfare operator trains with a Mk 15 Mod 1 rifle. USN At the annual SOF Week conference in May, SOCOM confirmed that it was open to rifles in new calibers to meet its ELR-SR needs and that the effort was building off previous work done by the Pentagon's Irregular Warfare Technical Support Directorate (IWTSD). An earlier IWTSD project called Extreme Sniper Strike Operations (ESSO) has produced a new very long-range precision cartridge called the .375 EnABELR (Engineered by Applied Ballistics for Extreme Long Range) and a bolt-action rifle to go along with it, which you can read more about here. As of at least March, IWTSD was still pursuing further development of the .375 EnABELR round. An M30-TS rifle in .375 EnABLER being fired. Applied Ballistics Applied Ballistics It is not entirely clear if the 'other efforts' SOCOM says it is now pursuing in lieu of ELR-SR are related to meeting the same or similar underlying operational needs, but in a different way, or if they are completely separate requirements that have taken precedence. 'Even if it’s [ELR-SR] just [the] improvement of our current .50 Cal systems, that’s fine too,' U.S. Army Col. John 'Tosh' Lancaster had told The War Zone and other attendees at the SOF Week conference earlier this year. 'We can make the .50 Cal better than it is right now. We haven’t done anything with that in a while.' Col. Lancaster is the Program Manager for Special Operations Forces (SOF) Lethality with U.S. Special Operations Command’s (SOCOM) SOF Warrior Program Executive Office. Both the original Barrett M82 and the McMillan TAC-50 on which the Mk 15 is based were first developed in the 1980s. Though there are no indications one way or the other that the two things are related, SOCOM's announcement about ELR-SR came three days after Barrett received a sole-source contract from the U.S. Army worth nearly $15 million for an unspecified number of M82/M107-series rifles, as well as 'spare parts, accessories and training.' A member of the US Army fires an M82/M107-series rifle. USAF An official justification for the Army's sole-sourced deal with Barrett is heavily redacted. None of the unredacted sections elaborate on the reason for buying the rifles or their expected recipients. Some of the guns might be intended to replace examples the U.S. military has transferred to Ukraine or be bound themselves for foreign allies and partners, as well as other branches of the U.S. government.

On September 4, the company announced a new direct deal with the Norwegian armed forces to upgrade their existing M82A1s to the newer M107A1 standard. There clearly continues to be demand, including among special operations forces, for the kinds of very long-range precision engagement capabilities that .50 caliber heavyweight sniper/anti-materiel rifles offer. These rifles can be very useful for trying to destroy or at least disrupt a variety of specialized targets including fuel and ammunition storage dumps, radar dishes, and even light vehicles, as well as enemy personnel. They can also fire a range of specialized ammunition, including types capable of producing incendiary and/or explosive effects. What other new capabilities SOCOM might now pursue instead of ELR-SR, or if it ultimately returns to seeking another similar new long-range precision rifle, remains to be seen. In the meantime, American special operators will continue to use their M82-series and Mk 15 rifles.

ARRW Hypersonic Missile Program Gets New Funding Despite Signs Of...	Lockheed Martin has received more than $13 million in additional funds for the AGM-183A Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW) hypersonic missile program. The deal could be part of work to wind down the effort, but is also the latest in a string of developments that have raised questions about its current status. The War Zone has already explored signs pointing to a potential follow-on to ARRW, possibly tied in with work on a related program called Tactical Boost Glide (TBG), which may already be occurring in the classified realm. On September 26, the U.S. Air Force awarded Lockheed Martin's Missile and Fire Control division a new modification, valued at $13,447,746, to an existing ARRW contact. The contract's cumulative value increased to $1,319,270,400 as a result. The news came in the Pentagon's daily contracting notice. A low-quality image of an ARRW after launch during a previous live-fire flight test. USAF 'Work will be performed in Orlando, Florida, and is expected to be completed by Aug. 31, 2025,' the Pentagon's notice added. 'Fiscal 2023 research, development, test, and evaluation funds in the amount of $13,447,746 are being obligated at the time of award.' No further details about the work to be performed were included. The War Zone reached out to Lockheed Martin for more information and was directed to contact the Air Force. We have since reached out to the Air Force for more information about this contract and ARRW's current status, but have not yet received a response. The Air Force did not request any additional funds for ARRW in its most recent budget request for the 2025 Fiscal Year, which the service rolled out earlier this year. The air-launched ARRW is what is known as a hypersonic boost-glide vehicle weapon. The missile uses a rocket booster to propel an unpowered hypersonic glide vehicle to an optimal speed and altitude and then releases it to glide down along a largely atmospheric flight path to its target. The vehicle travels at hypersonic speed, defined as anything about Mach 5, and is also designed to be able to make erratic movements along the way. The combination of speed and maneuverability makes weapons of this kind difficult to detect in enough time to act, let alone intercept, presenting major complications for defenders. A graphic showing, in a very rudimentary way, the difference in trajectories between hypersonic boost-glide vehicles, traditional ballistic missiles, quasi or aeroballistic missiles, and air-breathing hypersonic cruise missiles. GAO For a time, the AGM-183A looked set to become the Air Force's first operational hypersonic weapon. However, last year, the service had indicated it was looking to close out work on ARRW and to shift focus to air-breathing hypersonic cruise missiles, which function in a completely different manner from hypersonic boost-glide vehicle weapons. The ARRW program had a mixed testing record, at least from what is known publicly. As noted, it is very possible that the new ARRW funding Lockheed Martin received last month is part of the work now to shut things down. 'ARRW will complete contract closeout, finalize documentation and analysis, and activities to support the leave behind capability,' the Air Force said in its 2025 Fiscal Year budget request. 'Testing will enable ARRW to collect valuable data, build capacity and capability, allow hypersonics programs to leverage and build upon each other, and project the overall technology forward.' In line with this, the Air Force continued with its previously planned flight testing schedule for ARRW even after announcing its intention to pull the plug on the program last year. This culminated with a final end-to-end test, at least that we know of, over the Western Pacific in March of this year. That launch also provided an opportunity for a significant demonstration of capability and show of force aimed particularly at the Chinese government, as The War Zone highlighted at the time and that you read more about here. A live AGM-183A ARRW under the wing of a B-52 bomber at Andersen Air Force Base on Guam ahead of a test over the Western Pacific earlier this year. USAF At the same time, it continues to be unclear whether or not the Air Force is truly through with ARRW and/or whether a direct follow-on program may already be in progress. 'When we're in the classified session, I can go into a little bit of detail about the differences between those two capabilities, specifically, and then we'll highlight again what characteristics you need based on the mission set,' Air Force Lt. Gen. Dale White, the Military Deputy at the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics told members of the House Armed Services Committee at a hearing in March. White was responding directly to a question about whether his service was more committed to hypersonic cruise missiles than hypersonic boost-glide vehicle designs. 'Let’s just say that there is a plan,' William LaPlante, the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, the Pentagon's top weapons buyer, had told members of Congress at another hearing back in February. 'It’s not something we can talk about in this open [unclassified] session. But we’d like to talk [in a classified setting].' Similar uncertainty continues to surround TBG, a separate, but related program that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and Air Force run jointly that also involves work on an unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicle design. A least one TBG flight test is understood to have occurred, but where or when that was conducted has not been confirmed. A rendering of DARPA’s Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 (HTV-2) being released. HTV-2 was among several previous hypersonic developments that DARPA said fed into the Tactical Boost Glide (TBG) program. DARPA A rendering of DARPA's Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 (HTV-2) being released. HTV-2 was among the previous hypersonic developments that DARPA said fed into the Tactical Boost Glide (TBG) program. DARPA When asked by The War Zone about TBG testing to date back in April, a DARPA spokesperson declined to confirm or deny any tests had occurred or provide any details about their outcomes. They also said they could not provide more information about the program beyond what is on the agency's website. 'The Tactical Boost Glide (TBG) program is a joint DARPA/U.S. Air Force (USAF) effort that aims to develop and demonstrate technologies to enable future air-launched, tactical-range hypersonic boost glide systems,' according to the TBG program description on DARPA's website at the time of writing. 'TBG is a two-phase effort that plans to include ground and flight testing to mature critical technologies, and aims to demonstrate the system performance achievable through the integration of those technologies. The program is using a disciplined systems engineering approach to define demonstration system objectives and identify enabling technologies needed for future systems.' TBG was originally presented as a lead-in to ARRW, but the programs ultimately ended up being conducted in parallel. Lockheed Martin, the prime contractor on both programs, has said in the past that ARRW had ultimately pulled ahead in terms of design maturity. The Air Force has also said previously that work done under TBG was incorporated into the development of ARRW. DARPA had been exploring the potential for turning the TBG system into a sea-launched weapon and there are plans to transition elements of the program to the U.S. Navy in the future, as well. The Navy is pursuing a separate hypersonic boost-glide vehicle weapon with the U.S. Army, which is set to be integrated onto Zumwalt class stealth destroyers and Block IV Virginia class submarines, as well as fired from ground-based launchers. That missile has experienced its own testing troubles. Separate questions have emerged previously about the Air Force's plans for its air-breathing Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile (HACM) program. 'It is early days in the program, and so you certainly hope that a program like HACM is on track at this stage, because it’s quite early. And they typically are, right? And so, I’d say it’s on track but it is a challenging program,' Andrew Hunter, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, told DefenseScoop in an interview published in December 2023. 'That’s why we’re undertaking a rapid prototyping effort really is to work through some of the potential risks, some of the potential technical risks associated with the HACM concept.' A rendering Raytheon has previously released in relation to the HACM program. Raytheon The Air Force, in partnership with the Australian armed forces, is still very publicly moving ahead with HACM. The first test of that missile, which Raytheon is leading the development of, could come as early as this month. Last week, Raytheon also received a new $73 million contract to help lay the groundwork for the production of those weapons. The hope is that HACM will reach at least a limited operational capability in 2027. Whatever the future might hold now for ARRW, some type of work at least on that program is funded now well into next year.

Bolt-M Aims To Make Kamikaze Drone Attacks More User Friendly, Ef...	Newcomer defense contractor Anduril has revealed its Bolt-M, an machine-learning infused strike drone, a quadcopter-type design that’s easily transportable and aims to put lethal precision firepower in the hands of individual soldiers. Bolt-M is already being lined up for testing by the U.S. Marine Corps, as that service looks to harness the capabilities of kamikaze drones, while its autonomous features point the way to a new generation of loitering munitions that are easier to use and more reliable than those currently fielded. The promise and dangers of AI-enabled lower-end aerial drones on the battlefield is something that TWZ has explored in depth in the past. Anduril is now looking to secure its position in this fast-changing field. Announced yesterday, the Bolt-M is part of a wider family of autonomous air vehicles that are man-portable and use the same basic vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) quadcopter platform. While the baseline Bolt is intended for surveillance and search and rescue, the Bolt-M (for munition) is more intriguing, building on the success and proliferation of smaller strike drones that have been used to great effect in Ukraine and elsewhere. Unlike the low-end kamikaze drones that are proliferating in Ukraine, which are primarily improvized first-person view (FPV) types, the Bolt-M uses machine learning and automation from the outset to make it easier to employ. Onboard software is used to 'automate the flight behaviors required to accurately track and strike a target, while providing human operators with four simple decisions: where to look, what to follow, how to engage, and when to strike,' the company explains in a press release. While the pilot of an FPV drone requires extensive training to successfully find and strike targets, the Bolt-M aims to provide soldiers with a much simpler way of achieving similar effects. The Bolt-M employs the now-familiar quadcopter configuration widely used in smaller drones. Anduril/YouTube screencap At the heart of Bolt-M is Anduril’s Lattice software platform that leverages AI and machine learning technologies. This automates the flight behaviors required to navigate to, find, track, and strike dynamic targets. While the drone features semi-autonomous waypoint navigation, the operator can also modify the flightpath using a touchscreen interface, although more basic navigation decisions are still made by the Lattice software, allowing the user to concentrate on other tasks. The operator can also select the distance from the target at which the drone should loiter, and the type of engagement profile to execute, depending on the target type and battlefield conditions. The drone’s object tracking capability means that the operator can draw a bounding box around any visually-acquired target using the drone's dual electro-optical and infrared camera. Bolt-M will then follow that target autonomously, but if a new threat emerges, the soldier can select it instead, meaning that time-sensitive and pop-up threats can be prosecuted. Bolt-M can also be used multiple times for reconnaissance in this manner. A target is selected on the Bolt-M ground control station (GCS). Anduril/YouTube screencap Automated target tracking of this kind is already making its way to the battlefield in Ukraine, albeit in a more rudimentary form. Being able to lock on to a target and complete the attack even if a communications link is degraded or lost entirely is extremely beneficial. First, it overcomes major issues with line-of-sight connectivity as the drone dives low to the ground to hit its target, where the feed to its controller degrades due topography and structures. It also makes the drone far less vulnerable to short-range electronic warfare systems, especially those mounted on vehicles themselves. The drone can continue its terminal attack run even if its communications link is totally disrupted via electroinc attack during the terminal phase of its attack run. There are other precedents for this kind of technology, notably the AeroVironment Switchblade, a series of miniature loitering munitions that have been in production for well over a decade and used extensively in Ukraine. These also offer a limited degree of autonomous attack capability, since, like the Bolt-M, the drone can fly itself to its target once it is designated by a human. In the Switchblade, this feature serves, above all, to improve the probability of a kill, especially when striking moving targets, but it is more austere than the suite of technology Anduril is brining forward with its Bolt-M.

Ryan Ramsammy More complex engagements can be carried out by the Bolt-M, too. For example, once a target is identified in Lattice, the soldier can select a standoff position for the drone. Bolt-M will remain there, typically out of visual or acoustic detection range, keeping track of the target and then striking it once instructed by the operator to do so. The soldier operating the drone can also optimize that terminal attack, selecting the most effective engagement angle and warhead fuzing, for example. Throughout, the operator can intervene in the engagement process, ensuring that the drone retains a human-in-the-loop, at least till the attack order is finalized, in line with U.S. Department of Defense protocol for lethal autonomous weapons. A screencap from a promotional video shows the detonation of a Bolt-M above a utility vehicle. Anduril/YouTube screencap It's worth noting that profusion of videos showing the successful employment of FPV drones in Ukraine — sometimes achieving accuracy that is hard to believe — belies the fact that many of these drones fail to hit their target. The need to make this class of weapon more reliable and resilient is pressing, although it remains a factor that will be balanced against cost and quality.

In this way, information gathered by Bolt-series drones can be shared with third-party platforms and commanders. Operating on a common software platform and across a common network, it's also possible that Bolt-M could be rapidly adapted to make cooperative 'swarming' attacks with a high degree of autonomy, although such a function hasn't been disclosed yet. In terms of performance, the Bolt-M drone has more than 40 minutes of endurance and a range of around 12 miles. The types of warheads include anti-personnel and anti-materiel, each of which can weigh up to three pounds. Different munition payloads can be carried, including some developed in collaboration with Kraken Kinetics, and others from Anduril. Typical targets include static or moving ground-based targets, including light vehicles, dismounted personnel, trenches, and more, Anduril says. The Bolt-M is provided with a mountable ground control station (GCS), and it’s designed for user safety, including an electronic safe and arm device (ESAD), meaning it can be transported across the battlefield without risk of detonation, and can be unpacked and launched in only five minutes. The same GCS can also be used for training and simulation, using the handheld interface. The safety interface for the Bolt-M as seen in a company video. Anduril/YouTube screencap Clearly, Bolt-M is inspired by the effectiveness of FPV drones in Ukraine and in other combat theaters but expands on the advantages of these kinds of lightweight, man-portable loitering munitions. By introducing a refined user interface powered by very capable and rapidly adaptable software, it should be far more reliable, easier to operate, and effective than an improvised FPV drone. That being said, cost remains a glaring unknown. While added features are great to have and better effectiveness on the battlefield is always a good thing, brining the price down to a point where Bolt-M can be bought in very large numbers could be critical to its success. This is also a field that is rapidly growing in terms of competition and is bound to get very price competitive in the near future. So far, we don't know the exact developmental status of Bolt-M, however, Anduril has confirmed that the U.S. Marine Corps will start testing it over the next six months, as part of 'a pretty rigorous test and evaluation campaign,' according to Anduril Chief Strategy Officer Chris Brose. This compressed timeline suggests that Bolt-M may well be informed by the company having tested similar capabilities already in Ukraine, as has been suggested. In April this year, Anduril was one of three companies (the others being Teledyne FLIR Defense and AeroVironment) that received a U.S. Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) contract under its Organic Precision Fires-Light (OPF-L) program. While OPF-L doesn’t specifically call for autonomous operations, it is looking for easy-to-use, explosives-laden, man-portable loitering munitions, as well as launchers for these weapons on ground vehicles and uncrewed surface vessels. Regardless, the appearance of Bolt-M is another very clear indicator that highly automated, feature rich, production class lower-end strike drones are fast becoming a reality.

North Korea Wading Deeper Into Russia’s War Against Ukraine	North Korea appears to be getting more deeply involved in the Ukraine war, going beyond supplying Russia with munitions. Its military engineers 'have been deployed to help Russia target Ukraine with ballistic missiles' it provided to Russia, The Guardian reported, citing senior officials in Kyiv and Seoul. Dozens of North Koreans are behind Russian lines, 'in teams that support launcher systems for KN-23 [short-range ballistic] missiles,' a source in Ukraine told the publication. As we reported earlier this year, North Korea began supplying Russia with those missiles, also known as Hwasong-11s, but about half were defective, according to an analysis from Ukrainian state prosecutors. North Koreans deployed alongside Russian troops in Ukraine, sources say Guardian Australia (@GuardianAus) October 10, 2024 South Korea’s Defense Minister, Kim Yong-hyun, told members of parliament in Seoul this week that it was 'highly likely' that North Korean officers had been deployed to fight alongside Russians, and as we previously reported, several had died last week in an attack on a Russian base in the Donetsk region. He did not give further details. The head of Ukraine’s Center for Countering Disinformation, Andriy Kovalenko, concurred. In a post on Telegram, he said that some North Koreans had been killed in Ukraine. His organization is part of the National Security and Defense Council. All this comes in the wake of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un's visit to Russia for a summit with President Vladimir Putin where the two men bolstered their deepening ties with a secret arms deal. It was reported that, among other things, it called for Pyongyang to send construction and engineering forces to Russia-occupied territories of Ukraine for rebuilding work. There was no indication of how many personnel would be involved or the exact nature of their work. The increasing evidence of North Korean troops in Ukraine marks a big escalation. Foreigners have fought as mercenaries for Russia, 'but if North Koreans are on the ground it would mark the first time a foreign government has sent troops in uniform to support Moscow’s war,' the Guardian noted 'North Korea is likely to deploy members of its regular armed forces to Ukraine in support of Russia, South Korea's defense chief said Tuesday, in the latest sign of deepening military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow&#8230;'As Russia and North Korea have signed a mutual… pic.twitter.com/1HBKWjfE3t&mdash; Rob Lee (@RALee85) October 9, 2024 Aside from helping Russia, North Korea benefits from this relationship by testing its weaponry and giving its troops live combat experience. 'For North Korea, which has supplied Russia with many shells and missiles, it’s crucial to learn how to handle different weapons and gain real-world combat experience,' Lim Eul-chul, a professor at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies in Seoul, the Guardian reported. 'This might even be a driving factor behind sending North Korean soldiers – to provide them with diverse experiences and wartime training.' In addition to troops, Pyongyang has given Moscow about three million artillery shells a year, about half of what Russian forces are using in Ukraine, according to Western intelligence, The Times of London reported. 'Although many of the shells are believed to be faulty, the sheer quantity has allowed Russia to make steady gains, most recently capturing the eastern Ukrainian city of Vuhledar. Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, head of the Ukrainian Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR), warned in September that shipments of North Korean shells were tilting the war in Russia’s favor. 'Our biggest problem from all these allies of Russia is from North Korea. Because with the volume of military products that they supply, they actually affect the intensity of the fighting,' he said. About half of the artillery shells used by Russia, about 3 million annually, come from North Korea, according to The Times. pic.twitter.com/c2ySBCPSCg&mdash; MilitaryNewsUA (@front_ukrainian) October 5, 2024 In addition to killing the North Korean officers, Ukraine has also attacked Russian facilities storing North Korean arms. On Wednesday the Ukrainian military said it destroyed North Korean ammunition in a strike on a depot in the town of Karachev, in Russia's Bryansk region, 60 miles from the Ukrainian border, Kovalenko said on Telegram. The warehouse belonged to the 67th arsenal of the Main Missile and Artillery Directorate of the Russian Defense Ministry.

However it appears to be clearly escalating its role. The Latest On the battlefield, Ukraine is 'mounting a strong defense' against Russia, with Russia’s Kursk region and Donetsk in eastern Ukraine seeing the heaviest fighting, a senior U.S. military official told reporters, including from The War Zone, on Wednesday. 'Up in Kursk, there have been some limited counterattacks by the Russians, but really there are no meaningful gains or exchanges of territory in the last several weeks, and then down in Donetsk, while the Russians did make some advances earlier in the summer, those advances have slowed compared to that time period.' Since February 2022, Ukraine 'has inflicted more than 600,000 casualties on Russian forces,' a senior U.S. defense official said at the same press briefing. 'In September of this year, Russia, Russian forces sustained more casualties in terms of both killed and wounded in action than in any other month of the war.' The bulk of the Russian casualties last month came during attacks on Pokrovsk and Vuhledar in Donetsk, the senior military official said, adding that Ukraine is taking a 'defense in depth' approach, trading territory for time with an eye toward a new offensive next year. 'My assessment is that the Ukrainians will be able to maintain their position and Kursk for some amount of time here into the future, I think several months and potentially beyond,' tne senior military official posited. There was little territory exchanged over the past few days according to the latest assessment from the Insitute for the Study of War (ISW). Kursk: Ukrainian and Russian forces 'continued assaults in Glushkovsky Raion west of the main Ukrainian salient in Kursk Oblast on October 7, 8, and 9 but did not make any confirmed advances,' ISW reported. Kharkiv: Russian forces recently advanced within Vovchansk amid continued offensive operations in northern Kharkiv Oblast on October 7, 8, and 9. 'Geolocated footage published on October 7 showing a Russian soldier raising a Russian flag in a building at the Vovchansk Aggregate Plant indicates that Russian forces likely recaptured the plant.' Luhansk: Russian forces recently advanced northwest of Kreminna amid continued offensive operations along the Kupyansk-Svatove-Kreminna line on October 8 and 9. Donetsk: Russian forces recently advanced near Siversk, southern Toretsk, southwest of Donetsk City and southeast of Pokrosk amid continued Russian offensive operations. Russian forces continued offensive operations near Chasiv Yar on October 7, 8, and 9, but there were no confirmed changes to the frontline in this area. Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces recently advanced during a counterattack east of Pokrovsk. Zaporizhzhia: Russian forces 'recently marginally advanced south of Stepnohirsk amid continued assaults in western Zaporizhia Oblast on October 7, 8, and 9,' ISW reported. 'Geolocated footage published on October 8 indicates that Russian forces recently marginally advanced in southwestern Kamyanske (south of Stepnohirsk).' Kherson: Russian forces continued assaults in the Kherson direction on October 7, 8, and 9, but there were no confirmed changes to the frontline in this direction.

Secretive X-37B Spaceplane To Use Aerobraking Maneuvers To Rapidl...	One of America's secretive X-37Bs is set to perform a series of aerobraking maneuvers that will significantly change its orbit, which is said to be a first-of-its-kind event for the mini-space shuttle. This is part of the seventh known X-37B mission, which began last December, and has already involved the reusable spaceplane operating in a much higher orbit than ever before. The U.S. Space Force, to which the two X-37Bs are now assigned, announced the planned orbital maneuvers as part of the current Orbital Test Vehicle 7 (OTV-7) mission earlier today. The X-37B that is now in space was launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on December 28, 2023. A SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket carrying one of two X-37B reusable spaceplanes blasts off from the Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39A on December 28, 2023. USSF Through the 'series of novel maneuvers, called aerobraking' the X-37B will 'change its orbit around Earth and safely dispose of its service module components in accordance with recognized standards for space debris mitigation,' according to the Space Force release. 'The use of the aerobraking maneuver – a series of passes using the drag of Earth's atmosphere – enables the spacecraft to change orbits while expending minimal fuel.' It isn't clear if the X-37B has already dropped to a lower orbit ahead of the aerobraking. As noted, the mini-shuttle will have to pass relatively close to the Earth to drag in the atmosphere to execute the maneuver at all. The use of aerobraking in space flight is not new and has been employed by NASA and other space agencies globally to change the orbits of other spacecraft for decades now. In its release today, Space Force also explicitly cited 'decades of general lessons learned from the scientific community conducting Moon and Mars missions,' along with experience gained during the previous six X-37B missions, as having contributed to the planning around these new maneuvers. 'Once the aerobrake maneuver is complete, the X-378 [sic; X-37B] will resume its test and experimentation objectives until they are accomplished, at which time the vehicle will de-orbit and execute a safe return as it has during its six previous missions,' the release adds. 'Since December 28, 2023, the United States Space Force, supported by the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office, has conducted radiation effect experiments and has been testing Space Domain Awareness technologies in a Highly Elliptical Orbit.' A picture of an X-37B after completing a previous mission. USAF 'This novel and efficient series of maneuvers demonstrates the Space Force's commitment to achieving groundbreaking innovation as it conducts national security missions in space,' Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall said in an accompanying statement. 'This first of a kind maneuver from the X-37B is an incredibly important milestone for the United States Space Force as we seek to expand our aptitude and ability to perform in this challenging domain,' Gen. Chance Saltzman, Chief of Space Operations, also said. This all being said, there are immediate questions about whether or not this is actually a first-of-its-kind event for the X-37B, which is already known to be extremely maneuverable. It 'can do an orbit that looks like an egg and, when it’s close to the Earth, it’s close enough to the atmosphere to turn where it is,' then-Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson said at the annual Aspen Security Forum in 2019. 'Which means our adversaries don’t know – and that happens on the far side of the Earth from our adversaries – where it’s going to come up next. And we know that that drives them nuts. And I’m really glad about that.' It remains unclear what exactly Wilson was describing and whether this was a capability the X-37B had actually demonstrated at that time. The War Zone has posited in the past that this might have pointed to the mini-shuttle's having the ability to dip its wing into the Earth's atmosphere as it passed by, and to use that force to rapidly redirect its orbit. Wilson's comments were already highly curious at that time and fed into long-standing speculation about the exact capabilities and mission sets of the X-37B. The reusable spaceplane has a truckbed-sized main payload bay and can carry additional payloads on a service module adapter attached to its tail end.

U.S. Space Force One of the two X-37Bs with a payload adapted fitted to its rear end, seen here ahead of a record-setting mission that began in 2020 and ended in 2022. U.S. Space Force As The War Zone was first to report on in 2021, the specific unit within the Space Force that now oversees the X-37Bs, Space Delta 9, has what is still a very nebulous 'orbital warfare' mission. Space Delta 9 'is the focal point for preparing, presenting and projecting assigned and attached forces for the purpose of conducting protect and defend operations and providing national decision authorities with response options to deter orbital threats,' is how the Space Force described the unit's mission following a routine change in its top leadership earlier this year. Space-based early warning satellites are the most commonly cited capabilities in this ecosystem, as seen in the video below. Currently, the Air Force only acknowledges having only one 'counter-space' system, a terrestrial electronic warfare jammer called the Counter Communications System (CCS). 'We &#8230; are looking at the role of EW [electronic warfare], particularly against some of the space threats that are coming out,' Air Force Secretary Kendall told The War Zone and other outlets at a media roundtable on the sidelines of the Air & Space Forces Association's (AFA) main annual conference last month. 'So the space-based side of it's very important to us.' In the face of these ever-expanding threats to U.S. assets in orbit, including Russian work on a new space-based nuclear-armed anti-satellite weapon, Space Force is 'creating counter-space capabilities that allows us to be more resilient&#8230; and then when they [adversaries] have offensive capabilities of their own, our ability to either maneuver, to deny, to hide, to run,' Chief of Space Operations Saltzman said at a separate roundtable at the AFA conference. This came in response to a direct question on this topic from our own Howard Altman. When asked if he could further elaborate on these developments, Saltzman flatly said 'no.' Aerobraking maneuvers could be one means for space-based assets to evade hostile attacks. 'We must conduct&#8230; responsible counter-space campaigning,' Gen. Michael Guetlein, Vice Chief of Space Operations, also said while speaking at the Defense News Conference in September. 'This means we must develop capabilities to&#8230; protect and defend ourselves, but in doing so, we need to demonstrate safe and professional behavior in alignment with international norms of behavior, and we must work hard to protect the environment from additional pollution that could jeopardize the use of space for generations to come.' At that time, Guetlein noted that 'most of this kit is classified,' but that 'a lot of it is focused on defeating the adversary's kill webs, if necessary.' Patches seen on the shoulder of a member of Space Delta 9 during a change-of-command ceremony in July 2024. USSF In 2022, the U.S. government announced a self-imposed moratorium on destructive direct-ascent anti-satellite weapon testing and called on others to do the same. Such testing, like one Russia conducted in 2021, creates clouds of debris that pose significant threats to other objects in orbit. In addition, the new details today about the X-37B's operating envelope and activities as part of OTV-7 highlight additional outstanding questions about future reusable spaceplanes, including ones with greater offensive capabilities, that the U.S. military might be pursuing. Space Force's first-ever officially commissioned piece of artwork, seen below, notably explicitly depicts a reusable space plane intercepting a hostile 'killer satellite.' USSF The War Zone asked officials at the AFA conference last month about any plans to expand the X-37B fleet or develop a follow-on vehicle, which they declined to answer at the time. We have reached out since for more information, but have yet to receive a response. In the meantime, just what we know about the X-37B OTV-7 mission, including the newly disclosed planned aerobraking maneuvers and the previously announced novel high elliptical orbit, continues to be especially interesting in of itself.

Orphaned A-29 Super Tucano Attack Planes Join USAF Test Pilot Sch...	The renowned U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School (USAF TPS) at Edwards Air Force Base in California has received a trio of Embraer A-29 Super Tucano two-seat single-engine turboprop attack planes, which it says are its first newly assigned aircraft in almost three decades. Originally acquired to help Air Force special operations aviators train their foreign counterparts, the A-29s are now set to be used for various testing purposes, including of new weapons and sensors. The three A-29s touched down at Edwards back in August, but the Air Force's 412th Test Wing, which is responsible for the USAF TPS, only officially announced their arrival today. Pictures released along with the announcement show that one of the Super Tucanos, seen below, is still wearing a special heritage paint scheme that pays homage to the World War II-era 1st Air Commando Group, which supported allied forces in the China, Burma, and India (CBI) theater. The other two A-29s have standard overall gray paint jobs. The Super Tucanos all still look to be configured as light attack aircraft with a .50 caliber machine gun in each wing and the ability to carry various munitions and other stores on any of five pylons, two under each wing and one underneath the fuselage. The A-29 also has the ability to mount a sensor turret containing electro-optical and/or infrared cameras underneath its fuselage. USAF Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) received the three A-29s starting in 2021 to support its Combat Aviation Advisor (CAA). However, the service subsequently decided to stand down its two dedicated CAA units, the 6th and 711th Special Operations Squadrons, ostensibly as part of a broader shift in the U.S. military to preparing for future high-end fights after decades of counter-insurgency and other lower-intensity missions. CAAs had been heavily utilized during the Global War on Terror era, as you can read more about in this feature from Task & Purpose. The Air Force had also notably helped facilitate the delivery of Super Tucanos to various allies and partners over the years, especially the now-defunct Afghan Air Force, and otherwise experimented with the type in the past. As of last year, the Air Force's plan had been to completely divest AFSOC's A-29s, with one possibility being that they might get passed on to foreign countries. USAF TPS, which provides advanced flight training for experimental test pilots, flight test engineers, and flight test navigators, now seems to have eagerly accepted the orphaned turboprops. 'The Air Force Test Center and [Test Pilot] School leadership saw these excess aircraft as a unique opportunity to expand the flight test and training capabilities at Edwards,' according to today's release from the 412th Test Wing. 'The decision to transfer A-29 aircraft to Edwards is a result of thoughtful analysis by the Test Pilot School and an excellent example of command agility and collaboration to take advantage of a unique, fleeting opportunity,' Michael Banzet, director of plans and programs for the Air Force Test Center, also said in a statement. 'Not only does this repurpose a $63 million taxpayer investment, it also modernizes and expands TPS curriculum to accelerate the fielding of combat capability for the USAF.' One of the gray-painted A-29 Super Tucanos that is now assigned to the USAF TPS. USAF Interestingly, the Air Force has also explicitly cited the demands of the U.S. military's new focus on future high-end conflicts as having helped drive this decision. 'As part of a broader shift in response to Global Power Competition, the Air Force Test Pilot School’s mission is evolving to meet strategic need,' the release from the 412th Test Wing says. 'A refined three-pillar focus includes development of world-class staff, creating highly adaptive critical thinking test leaders, and advancing cutting-edge research.' USAF 'While the A-29’s airframe design is perfect for spin testing, the Super Tucano also offers an array of modern avionics with the ability to externally hang equipment through various wing pylons,' it continues. 'This will allow the school to conduct training and research on a variety of multi-domain sensors and weapons, reducing reliance on T-38 and F-16 aircraft while enhancing the ability to perform aspects of the developmental test mission tasked to the Air Force Test Center.' In addition to T-38s and F-16s, the USAF TPS regularly makes use of Air Force C-12s, which are militarized variants of the twin-engine turboprop Beechcraft King Air family. A picture of an A-29 equipped with a sensor turret in service with the now-defunct Afghan Air Force. USAF It's also interesting to note here that around the same time AFSOC first acquired the three A-29s, the Air Force also purchased a pair of Beechcraft AT-6E Wolverines to support light attack experimentation efforts. The Wolverine is based on the T-6 Texan II trainer, which is in service with the Air Force and the U.S. Navy. This included work on a low-cost communications and data-sharing architecture intended primarily for American allies and partners called Airborne Extensible Relay Over-Horizon Network, or AEROnet. The two-seat single-engine turboprop AT-6E is similar, but also different in many respects to the Super Tucano, as you can read more about here. The current status of those aircraft is not immediately clear. One of the two AT-6Es the Air Force acquired in the early 2020s. USAF The acquisition of the AT-6Es had evolved from a succession of abortive Air Force light attack aircraft programs starting around 2017, which had in turn followed on-again-off-again interest in such a capability dating back even further. Those efforts have since evolved into U.S. Special Operations Command's Armed Overwatch program and the OA-1K Sky Warden, a light attack derivative of the Air Tractor AT-802 crop duster, which you can learn more about here. The arrival of the A-29s certainly comes at a particularly significant moment in time for USAF TPS. It is very actively involved at present in supporting work on artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous capabilities, and other advanced uncrewed aircraft efforts. This includes a milestone AI-driven dogfight involving the school's specialized X-62A test jet, a highly modified two-seat F-16D, earlier this year. Many of these developments are feeding into other programs, such as the Air Force's Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) effort. In this context, especially, using the A-29s to help free up F-16s, including the specialized X-62A, as well as T-38s for testing that requires their higher performance and other capabilities, makes good sense. The Super Tucanos do still offer high degrees of agility and performance, but at speeds closer to the USAF TPS' C-12s, allowing them to carry out tasks that fast jets simply cannot. The A-29s also have robust avionics packages that can be altered for all different test purposes. The A-29s give USAF TPS organic assets that are dissimilar from ones in widespread use in the U.S. military, as well. The school often contracts out for such aircraft to give students familiarity in a broader array of types. The speed and performance of the Super Tucanos would also make them well suited to acting as chase planes for drones. In addition, F-16s and T-38s could just have to fly less thanks to the arrival of the A-29s, helping to reduce operating costs and wear and tear on those jets. The Super Tucano offers a platform that is less expensive to fly, in general, regardless of what tasks it might be given. USAF If nothing else, the three ex-AFSOC A-29s are now entering a completely different chapter in their service to the Air Force.

Protective Nets To Shield F-22s Eyed For Airbase Swarmed By Myste...	U.S. Air Force officials at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia are looking at installing anti-drone nets to help protect F-22 Raptor stealth fighters on the flightline. This comes nearly a year after the base was subjected to waves of still-mysterious drone incursions, which The War Zone was first to report. It also underscores the U.S. military's continued lag when it comes to responding to the very real threats posed by uncrewed aerial systems, at home and aboard, and particular hurdles to doing so domestically. Langley's 633rd Contracting Squadron put out a notice on October 4 asking for information about potential counter-drone netting that could be installed around up to 42 existing open-ended sunshade-type shelters at the base. Langley, now technically part of Joint Base Langley-Eustis, is one of a select few bases to host F-22s and is a key component of the Air Force's posture to defend the U.S. homeland. A pair of F-22 Raptor stealth fighters turn on final approach to Langley Air Force Base in Virginia. USAF The 633rd 'is in the process of determining the acquisition strategy to obtain non-personal services for the Unmanned Ariel Services (UAS) Netting for East Ramp Metal Sunshades,' according to the contracting notice. 'The intention of the netting is to deter and ultimately prevent the intrusion of UAS’s near airmen and aircraft. This initial sunshade netting installation on the metal sunshade (bay Alpha 1) shall serve as a proof of concept for the remaining sunshades.' The 'netting should be capable of disabling a Group 1/ 'Small' Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), such as the DJI Matrice 300 RTK, while remaining attached,' the notice explains. Per the U.S. military's definitions, drones in Group 1 can have weights of up to 20 pounds, fly up to 1,200 feet, and reach speeds of up to 100 knots. The 'netting shall be composed of a UV-resistant, moisture-resistant material capable of withstanding temperatures up to 400°F without damage. It shall also have a tensile strength of 200 lbs. or greater. Polyester or nylon are preferred materials, but any material with adequate properties is acceptable. Netting squares shall be no larger than 3' across,' the notice adds. 'Additional hardware and cabling should be strong enough to support the net and potential push or pull due to 40 mph winds when the netting is deployed and 120 mph (3-second gust) when netting is retracted/stowed. When retracted/stowed, the netting must be adequately secured. Lead core or other forms of weights installed along the bottom of the netting may be necessary to prevent the netting from blowing into aircraft or personnel; design may include recessed anchoring to existing concrete pad. Alternative means of anchoring the netting may also be acceptable.' However the nets are configured and installed, the 633rd says they need to be 'quickly and easily retractable' so F-22s can get in and out without issue. The installations also can't impede movement along the adjacent taxiways in any way. A graphic offering general details about the sunshade-type shelters at Langley that could now be in line to receive anti-drone nets. USAF In May, the 4th Contracting Squadron at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina put out a similar call for potential 'passive' drone defense options, which could also include nets, to help protect that base's F-15E Strike Eagle combat jets. As already noted, the possibility now of adding anti-drone nets to the sunshades at Langley comes after that base experienced a series of still-unexplained drone incursions over the course of several weeks last December. Though the Air Force said at the time that there did not appear to be any 'hostile intent' behind those incidents, they still prompted a major whole-of-government response that you can read more about in detail here. Langely had been subjected to unauthorized drone incursions before then that the Air Force acknowledged had both disrupted operations at the base and highlighted potential threats, as well. 'One day last week I had two small UASs that were interfering with operations… At one base [Langley], the gate guard watched one fly over the top of the gate check, tracked it while it flew over the flight line for a little while, and then flew back out and left,' now-retired Air Force Gen. James 'Mike' Holmes, then head of Air Combat Command (ACC), said back in 2017. 'Imagine a world where somebody flies a couple hundred of those and flies one down the intake of my F-22s with just a small weapon on it.' When that news emerged, The War Zone noted that it would be ever easier for a hostile actor to simply target aircraft exposed while parked on the flightline. Doing so would also offer adversaries a means to neutralize large numbers of planes before they could even into the fight. A F-22 exits a sunshade-type shelter at Langley Air Force Base. USAF Samuel King Jr. The War Zone has otherwise been sounding the alarm about threats posed on and off traditional battlefields by drones, including small commercial types like the DJI Matrice 300 RTK mentioned in the 633rd's contracting notice that can be readily weaponized, for many years now. Worrisome incidents around U.S. bases and other military assets domestically, including ships off the coast of Southern California and aircraft flying in restricted airspace, as well as critical non-military infrastructure within the United States have only continued to emerge in recent years. Just in August, we were the first to report on a series of mysterious drone incursions around the Air Force's Plant 42 in Palmdale, California, which ultimately led to the imposition of new temporary flight restrictions around the facility. Plant 42 is a top hub for advanced aerospace development work, including highly classified military programs like the B-21 Raider stealth bomber. The first pre-production B-21 Raider in a hangar at Plant 42. USAF The first B-21 in a hangar at Plant 42. USAF This is a concerning trend that has now also been steadily emerging globally. The ongoing fighting in Ukraine has now fully driven the reality of uncrewed aerial threats, especially when it comes to highly maneuverable first-person view (FPV) kamikaze drones and other smaller weaponized types, into the mainstream discourse. Both Ukrainian and Russian forces have actively been targeting each other's aircraft on the ground, including with drones and over great distances.

The bar to entry, particularly when it comes to acquiring and employing FPV-type and other smaller weaponized drones, is already very low. This all, in turn, has also prompted a new explosion in demand for counter-drone capabilities, including within the U.S. military. It's interesting to note here that nets were among the first countermeasures to emerge on the battlefield in Ukraine. This morning there was a video with anti-drone nets hanging Wagner above the road near Bakhmut, and already in the evening a video testing their effectiveness pic.twitter.com/eGXVbfsrJ1&mdash; MilitaryNewsUA (@front_ukrainian) September 25, 2023 Installing nets at Langley certainly represents one option for helping to address threats posed by smaller drones, but also one that would be most useful as part of a larger layered array of active and passive defensive measures. As the 633rd's contracting notice makes clear, the immediate goal with the nets is only to shield against very localized intrusions by the lowest tier of drones. The fact that this initial contracting process has only begun now after the December drone incursions and the ones in 2017, which are just the incidents at Langley we know about, is also telling. This comes amid a larger debate inside the U.S. military and out about how best to protect American military bases and other assets domestically, as well as forces in the field, from drones. Members of Congress have been particularly vocal in recent months in their criticism of steps the U.S. military has taken to date, especially when it comes to hardening physical infrastructure against uncrewed aerial systems and other threats, as you can read more about in detail here. An F-22 taxis away from a hangar at Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany during a deployment there in 2015. The Air Force is currently engaged in a particularly vocal debate about whether it should be building more robust shelters to protect its aircraft from drones and other threats. USAF At the same time, the U.S. military also continues to be faced with a morass of often convoluted legal, regulatory, and other challenges when it comes to implementing counter-drone capabilities domestically. The previous contracting notice from Seymour Johnson explicitly highlighted the attractiveness of 'passive' defense options since they are not subject to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) restrictions. Efforts have been made in the past to try to expand and otherwise streamline authorities available to U.S. military forces to take more active actions against drone threats, but issues clearly remain. These same factors also apply to other branches of the U.S. government. There have been legislative proposals from members of Congress just in the past few months to give new domestic counter-drone authorities to the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice, and the Central Intelligence Agency. The recent anti-drone net contracting notice Langley only further underscores the critical need now to address these issues and otherwise take steps to help defend bases and other key assets against uncrewed aerial threats with an array of capabilities.

Hurricane Milton Could Be Sum Of All Weather Fears For MacDill Ai...	Surrounded by more than seven miles of coastline and sitting just 14 feet above sea level at its highest elevation, MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida juts out into Hillsborough Bay like a uvula. Given its location, longstanding concerns exist that a major hurricane could swamp the headquarters of U.S. Central Command, U.S. Special Operations Command and dozens of other base tenant units. Now Hurricane Milton is storming its way toward Florida’s west coast, expected to make landfall south of Tampa as a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of up to 160 miles per hour. Two weeks after suffering damage from Hurricane Helene, MacDill officials are preparing for what could be storm effects unlike anything this base has seen in its 83 years of operations. Google Earth view of MacDill AFB that sits in the heart of the bay in Tampa. (Google Earth) Google Earth image Even though Helene made landfall in Perry, Florida, about 160 miles north of MacDill, the base saw a record-breaking storm surge of seven feet, nine inches, a spokesperson for the 6th Air Refueling Wing (ARW), the base host unit, told The War Zone. The latest forecast as of Noon Eastern time Wednesday shows Milton, a massive hurricane, striking Sarasota, about 35 miles south of the base.

That would be devastating to the entire Tampa Bay region with a population of more than 3.3 million people and put most of MacDill under water. 'Approximately 93% of MacDill AFB is within the 100-year floodplain,' according to a 2022 base resource management plan. 'Tropical storms typically flood much of the southern and northwestern portions of MacDill, and all of the base proper would be flooded by a Category 3 or greater hurricane.' Anticipating MacDill could be hit hard, Col. Ed Szczepanik, the installation commander, ordered a mandatory evacuation of the base on Oct. 7, effective by Oct. 8. The base has 26 KC-135 Stratotankers flown by the 6th ARW and the 927 ARW. All that were able to fly left for McConnell Air Force Base in Wichita Kansas. There are also Black Hawk helicopters from an Army Reserve unit that have evacuated as well. The 20,000 people who work on MacDill as well as the residents of nearly 600 homes were ordered to leave the base. Airmen assigned to the 6th Air Refueling Wing and the 927th ARW relocated KC-135 Stratotankers ahead of Hurricane Milton at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida, Oct. 6, 2024. Aircraft were relocated due to projected winds and are expected to return once flying conditions are favorable.

It is also fighting Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis, who have waged a nearly year-long campaign attacking shipping in the Red Sea region. 'We are maintaining 24-7 operations working out of alternative sites,' CENTCOM spokesman Col. John Rigsbee told The War Zone. Opened in 2011, CENTCOM’s headquarters is one of the newest buildings on MacDill. It was constructed to withstand hurricane-force winds and rising water. 'We are preparing for the worst,' Rigsbee explained. 'We won’t know until we see the full extent of damage, but we are fully prepared to continue operations even if systems at headquarters are down. There are plans in place to maintain operations. We are not going down and it won’t take too much time to return.' The new CENTCOM headquarters, which opened in 2011, was built to withstand hurricanes. (Clark Construction) In the meantime, CENTCOM personnel are working out of several locations, including Raymond James Stadium and Homestead Air Reserve Base near Miami, where the Joint Operations Center will be set up, a U.S. defense official told The War Zone. SOCOM 'dispersed to three different locations,' Col. Alexandra Weiskopf, the command spokesperson, told The War Zone. 'With our Washington D.C. office, we will have comms up in four different locations and there will be no degradation to our continuity of operations.' MacDill being devastated by a hurricane is something 'we always thought was a possibility,' retired Army Gen. Joseph Votel, who ran both commands, told us. 'There was a plan to use Raymond James in the event of a serious issue at MacDill. I always thought SOCOM headquarters was very vulnerable - but CENTCOM headquarters was built with a hurricane in mind.' The SOCOM building 'was old and only two stories,' Votel explained. 'Power sources and data centers were largely at ground level.' An aerial view of McDill AFB. (Tatiraju.rishabh/wikicommons) As for concerns about the base being so badly damaged, that it would remain unusable, Votel said he didn’t 'recall any discussions about never coming back - we may have lacked imagination.' The 6th ARW will have a 185-member hurricane recovery team at Raymond James Stadium ready to assess any damage as soon as it is safe enough, Capt. Kaitlin Butler, a wing spokesperson, told us. Meanwhile, the base is still in the last throes of post-Helene cleanup. 'The biggest problems with Helene were storm surge and power outages,' Butler said. There was some flooding affecting the water treatment facility, she added, but for the most part, full base operations were quickly restored.

Hurricane Helene, a Category 4 storm, carved out a devastating path from Florida's Gulf Coast to Tennessee and brought record-breaking storm surge to MacDill AFB. (U.S. Air Force photo by Capt. Kaitlin Butler and 2nd Lt. Laura Anderson) A direct or close hit could be a different story. The Defense Department is spending nearly $5 billion to rebuild Tyndall Air Force Base in the Florida Panhandle, which was directly in the path of Category 5 Hurricane Michael on Oct. 10, 2018. Most of that damage was caused by the winds blowing in at 160 miles per hour. Aircraft that were left behind faced damage or destruction. Debris littered Tyndall Air Force Base following Hurricane Michael on October 17, 2018 in Panama City, Florida. the base experienced extensive damage from the storm.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images) Scott Olson There are other military installations in Florida preparing to deal with Milton, including those on Florida's east coast, near where Milton could cross over. 'Space Launch Delta 45 is monitoring Hurricane Milton and will continue making preparations as weather dictates,' spokeswoman Maggie Nave told us. 'Patrick Space Force Base and Cape Canaveral Space Force Station have entered [hurricane preparation] HURCON status, which will be adjusted based on the anticipated timing of storm impacts. At this time, tenant units have moved aircraft assets out of the local area.' Naval Station Mayport has sent three Arleigh Burke class guided missile destroyers underway, while those vessels unable to leave are being placed on heavy moorings, spokesman David Holmes told us. The station has shut down operations and only essential mission personnel are allowed in. Naval Air Station Jacksonville is being closed for two days, with personnel slated to come back as early as Friday depending on what happens, spokesperson Kaylee Larocque told us. In addition '26 U.S. Navy MH-60R Seahawks and approximately 200 personnel from Naval Station Mayport and Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Florida relocated to Maxwell Air Force Base in preparation for Hurricane Milton,' according to officials there. The preparations being made for Hurricane Milton are another stark reminder of how climate is affecting the military, especially in locations like Florida prone to these natural disasters While there are no plans to shutter places like MacDill and Tyndall, the cost to keep them operational in the face of major hurricanes like Milton will only rise.

Signs Point To North Korea Building A Nuclear-Powered Submarine: ...	North Korea appears to have started building a new submarine, which may feature nuclear propulsion, according to a South Korean official. The development would be in line with previous reports and follows the launch, last September, of a reworked Cold War-era Romeo class diesel-electric submarine designed to carry ballistic missiles. You can read more about that ‘Frankensub’ project here. 'Partial signs that appear to be the start of the submarine’s construction have been detected,' South Korea’s Defense Intelligence Agency said in a report to Representative Kang Dae-sik of the ruling People Power Party. 'As construction is still in its early stages, further confirmation is needed on whether it is nuclear powered,' the report said. A satellite image of the Pongdae Submarine Factory on the northeast coast of North Korea, the center of its submarine development activities. Google Earth An unnamed South Korean military official told the country’s Yonhap News Agency that construction work on the submarine had been identified in the northeastern Sinpo area — presumably at the Pongdae Submarine Factory — and that the boat was bigger than previous ones fielded by North Korea. 'Its exact tonnage and other [details] can be accurately determined once progress is made,' the same official said. The South Korean military’s assessment that the new submarine could be nuclear-powered seems to be based on its size, with no publicly available evidence at this point that North Korea has developed a suitable nuclear reactor for such a boat. However, there have been statements from the leadership in Pyongyang that a nuclear-powered submarine is planned. At the Party Congress in January 2021, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un announced that 'the design of a new nuclear-powered submarine was researched and was in the stage of final examination.' Kim added that design work on various weapons and sensors for such a design had already been completed. A man watches a television screen showing news footage of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un attending the Party Congress in Pyongyang, on January 6, 2021. Photo by JUNG YEON-JE/AFP via Getty Images JUNG YEON-JE A future North Korean nuclear-powered submarine was mentioned by the country’s state media after Kim presided over the launch ceremony for the diesel-electric submarine named Hero Kim Kun Ok (hull number 841) that took place at Sinpo on September 6, 2023. The North Korean diesel-electric submarine Hero Kim Kun Ok (hull number 841). KCNA There were also reports from earlier this year that work on such a boat might already be underway. In January, Kim is said to have inspected a nuclear-powered submarine under construction, as well as watching a 'strategic cruise missile' test. These events were reported by Pyongyang’s state media, but no photos or further details of the new submarine were released. Again, Sinpo was identified as the likely location of the construction work. State media reports on Kim inspecting the nuclear submarine project for the first time, but doesn't show images of the sub. Also says cruise missiles were launched from underwater but doesn't show the sub involved (if it wasn't a submersible barge anyway) Colin Zwirko (@ColinZwirko) January 28, 2024 Kim was said to have received 'a detailed understanding of the nuclear submarine construction' as well as providing instructions about 'issues' related to it. It should be noted that, despite these reports, the choice of nuclear propulsion for North Korea’s next submarine remains unconfirmed and there has been skepticism in the past whether such ambitions are even realistic. Historically, submarine reactors have been particularly complex to master, given the demanding integration and power-generation requirements. The ability of North Korea to build a nuclear-powered submarine is certainly questionable, although the country’s increasingly close relations with Russia since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine could well have provided Pyongyang with technologies and expertise that would help achieve this. Since the start of North Korea’s military support for Russia in the war in Ukraine, TWZ has raised the possibility of reciprocal assistance from Moscow, which could well focus on nuclear and advanced missile technologies. Help in building a new submarine might also be an option. If the Hero Kim Kun Ok reflects the current state of the art of North Korea’s submarine-building capabilities, then a nuclear-powered design does indeed look a long way off, although it’s not impossible. The Hero Kim Kun Ok is essentially a very deep rework of a Soviet-designed Romeo class diesel-electric submarine with a new capability for submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), thanks to a grafted-on missile compartment behind the sail. As well as SLBMs, the submarine appears to be able to launch cruise missiles, or perhaps SLBMs of two different sizes (offering differing ranges and payloads). Hatches in the missile compartment of the Hero Kim Kun Ok. The forward four are larger than the rear six, indicating a mix of missile payloads. KCNA Despite its bizarre appearance, the non-nuclear Hero Kim Kun Ok reinforces the fact that North Korea is busy trying to build a second-strike nuclear deterrent in the form of SLBMs and submarine-launched cruise missiles (SLCMs). The ‘Frankensub’ is far from ideal, however, as we have discussed before. If it becomes operational, it will be very noisy and easily tracked once on patrol. Furthermore, with only one or two boats capable of nuclear deterrent patrols, the North Korean nuclear second-strike deterrent is not the most credible. A nuclear-powered boat would offer huge benefits here, including essentially unlimited underwear endurance and potentially reduced acoustic signature, among others. Pyongyang’s previous efforts to field SLBMs onboard operational submarines have achieved only limited success. The lone example of the Gorae class is also based on a significantly modified Romeo class attack sub. Kim Jong Un, in gray in the foreground, talks to other North Korean officials while inspecting a Gorae (modified Romeo) class submarine. North Korean State TV capture That being said, the development of these submarines is still significant for North Korea, and building a new and larger submarine design — nuclear-powered or otherwise — would be the logical next step. It’s worth noting that Pyongyang has also struggled with fielding a workable SLBM, hampered to a significant degree by the lack of a genuinely suitable submarine to launch it from. At the same time, North Korea has developed increasingly large SLBMs, without any obvious submarine hull big enough to accommodate them. That, too, points to the development of a new and larger submarine design. SLBMs identified as the Pukguksong-5 on parade in January 2021. These are the biggest North Korean SLBMs seen so far. KCNA Presuming the new submarine is nuclear-powered, it’s possible that it could also be intended as a hunter-killer attack submarine, although North Korea’s emphasis on offensive missile capabilities would seem to make this much less likely. On the other hand, it could also be a testbed for new technologies, which would be especially useful if North Korea has actually developed a suitable reactor, or plans to, perhaps with Russian assistance. Speaking to TWZ, Alex Luck, an analyst who closely follows submarine developments, especially in the Indo-Pacific region, said that a nuclear-powered design would not be unexpected, based on previous official statements. However, 'the technical challenges would still seem daunting, assuming North Korea isn’t receiving assistance from elsewhere.' Luck said he hasn’t seen any detailed reports assessing that North Korea has developed a suitable reactor design, but also raises the possibility that the new submarine isn’t a 'classic nuclear-powered' boat, but perhaps some sort of hybrid. This could be a conventionally powered submarine with an auxiliary or experimental nuclear reactor, similar to how some reports describe the mysterious new (and unrelated) Chinese Type 041, or Zhou class submarine.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION PHOTO © 2024 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Interestingly, Luck also identifies a new assembly hall at Sinpo adjacent to the one in which the modified Romeo design was completed last year, which could also point to the new submarine design being built here. Luck also notes that it’s possible the ‘new’ submarine is actually another modified Romeo, which would seem operationally logical considering last year’s launch, although wouldn’t really explain the apparent size discrepancy. Kim riding on a Romeo class years ago. The type dates back to the 1950s and still makes up the backbone of the North Korean Navy’s submarine fleet. KCNA That explanation would, however, fit with Kim’s statement at the launch of the Hero Kim Kun Ok, during which he spoke of a 'plan to remodel existing medium-sized submarines into offensive ones loaded with tactical nuclear weapons to play an important role in modern warfare,' as part of what he described as a 'low-cost ultra-modernization strategy.' Overall, North Korea’s submarine force still dominates that of the South in terms of numbers, with as many as 86 boats, although this total includes midget submarines. South Korea operates around 21 submarines, although it’s also notably developing an SLBM capability for its latest diesel-electric boats. For now, South Korea is busily working on conventionally armed SLBMs, but there are growing suggestions that it might also look to introduce a nuclear capability in the future. This comes against the backdrop of worsening relations on the peninsula overall and an expanding dialogue between South Korea and the United States in terms of joint nuclear-planning exercises. South Korea is working to add a conventional SLBM capability to its Dosan Ahn Changho class diesel-electric submarines. DAPA Until we see some imagery or other technical detail, it’s too early to make any definitive conclusions, although there’s little doubt that submarines — and especially ones able to provide a second-strike deterrent capability — are a priority for North Korea.

New Vision For Lift Fan Aircraft Family Grows From Special Operat...	Aurora Flight Sciences has released new renderings of an uncrewed fan-in-wing vertical take-off-and-landing capable demonstrator aircraft it is currently working on, as well as of a revised vision for a scaled-up cargo aircraft based on the same technology. The demonstrator is being developed under a U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) program centered on interest in a new high-speed, runway-independent special operations transport plane. Aurora's unveiling of the new renders also comes amid growing interest from the U.S. Air Force in similar capabilities to support more general distributed logistics missions, especially in contested environments during future high-end conflicts. Aurora, a subsidiary of Boeing, shared the new renders and provided more information about the work it is doing as part of DARPA's Speed and Runway Independent Technologies (SPRINT) program earlier today. DARPA awarded new SPRINT contracts to Aurora, as well as Bell, earlier this year. SPRINT, which kicked off last year, is directly tied U.S. Special Operations Command’s (SOCOM) High-Speed Vertical Takeoff and Landing (HSVTOL) project. A rendering showing Aurora's current SPRINT uncrewed demonstrator design, at right, and a scaled-up crewed cargo aircraft concept based on the same technology, at left. Aurora Flight Sciences 'Aurora and Boeing are collaborating on the development of key technologies that combine to deliver a revolutionary solution to mobility challenges in contested environments and across distributed military bases,' according to a press release from Aurora. 'Fan-in-wing (FIW) technology combines an embedded lift fan with a blended wing body design to enable vertical lift agility without sacrificing the payload capacity and aerodynamic efficiency associated with today’s fixed wing aircraft.' 'The team is currently designing an uncrewed demonstrator with a 45-ft wingspan and 1,000-pound payload capacity for the SPRINT program,' the release adds. 'The propulsion system includes off-the-shelf turbofan and turboshaft engines that would power the vehicle to a maximum of 450 knots true airspeed (KTAS).' The new rendering of the SPRINT demonstrator is broadly in line with one that Aurora put out in May. It has a blended-wing platform with a v-tail along with three lift fans in a triangular arrangement – one to either side of the central fuselage section and another in the nose end. The revised render shows more streamlined intakes for the main engines underneath the body. One of the new renderings of Aurora's SPRINT demonstrator design. Aurora Flight Sciences A rendering Aurora released of its SPRINT demonstrator concept back in May. Aurora Flight Sciences A rendering of Aurora Flight Sciences revised SPRINT design concept. Aurora Flight Sciences 'Earlier this year, the team completed the first of three major test events scheduled for the current phase of the SPRINT program to prove out the feasibility of the FIW technology,' according to Aurora. 'The ground effect test, conducted using a 4.6-ft wingspan model with three lift fans, showed that suck down effects created by the lift fans in hover were negligible and that the landing gear is set to the appropriate height to minimize adverse pitching moments from forming during ground operations. Wind tunnel tests planned for late 2024 and early 2025 include a stability and control test using a 9-ft full wingspan aircraft model and a 5¼-ft semi-span embedded lift fan test to model aerodynamic effects.' A picture of an actual test article Aurora has been using in the development of its SPRINT demonstrator. Aurora Flight Sciences 'Aurora’s concept is designed to meet or exceed the challenging program objectives that DARPA set for the program. For example, the blended wing body platform is capable of 450 knot cruise speed, and the embedded lift fans with integrated covers allow a smooth transition from vertical to horizontal flight,' the company has also said in the past. 'The design also leverages existing engine solutions, shortening development risk and timelines. In addition to VTOL, the aircraft is capable of short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL), super short take-off and landing (SSTOL), and conventional take-off and landing.' Aurora is currently aiming to reach first flight with the SPRINT demonstrator in 2027. However, the company is already looking to the future. 'The technology demonstrated in the SPRINT X-plane could be scaled to medium and heavy lift aircraft, creating a future family of systems. For example, Aurora envisions a manned, 130-ft wingspan aircraft with four lift fans and 40-ft payload bay,' today's press release explains. 'The FIW aircraft could meet or exceed the payloads, ranges, and speeds typical of fixed wing military transport aircraft while delivering the tactical advantage of true vertical takeoff and landing.' The rendering Aurora has now released of this larger fan-in-wing design concept shows significant changes from the one it put out back in 2023. The new design has a tailless modified cranked kite planform with lower profile air intakes on top of the rear end of the central body. Like the 2023 render, Aurora's revised vision for a larger crewed fin-in-wing aircraft still features four lift fans two on either side of the central body. One of the new renderings of Aurora's scaled-up design derived from the SPRINT demonstrator. Aurora Flight Sciences The design seen in the new rendering appears to reduce some stealthy features and magnify others, notably with the elimination with the vertical tails. What Aurora showed in 2023 did have sharper and narrower wing sections, as well as a more pronounced beak-like nose and chine line along the forward edge of the central body. A rendering of a larger fan-in-wing design concept that Aurora released in relation to the SPRINT program back in 2023. Aurora Flight Sciences A rendering of Aurora Flight Sciences' SPRINT design concept. Aurora Flight Sciences The new Aurora rendering also notably shows changes to the design of the lift fan covers. The design the company presented last year had split covers – different versions of the original concept showed circular and hexagonal cover shapes – while the new one has multi-sectioned covers. This is very reminiscent of how the lift fan in the nose of the 1960s-era Ryan Vertifan was covered. The Vertifan had a three-fan configuration that is otherwise similar in some very broad respects to Aurora's SPRINT demonstrator design. An artist’s conception of a fan-in-wing Special Operations Forces Transport Aircraft (SOFA) concept from Lockheed in the 1980s also shows similar sectional fan coverings.

Lockheed via Ebay It is worth noting here that 40 feet is also how long the payload bay is on standard-length variants of the venerable C-130 family, which has long been used as a baseline for mid-tier military airlifter development. Boeing used this same dimensional rubric when crafting a concept that it unveiled last year for a new stealthy aircraft that could be configured as a transport or an aerial refueling tanker. That design, which is intended to take off and land from traditional runways, also has a blended wing body planform that is similar in some broad strokes to Aurora's proposed SPRINT-derived cargo plane. A stealthy blended wing body design concept Boeing unveiled publicly in 2023. Boeing A model depicting the blended wing body concept Boeing unveiled in January 2023. Boeing The War Zone has also previously pointed out on multiple occasions how Aurora's work under SPRINT is broadly evocative of a host of vertical and short takeoff and landing-capable designs the U.S. military has at least explored since the 1980s. Supporting special operations missions was a central theme in many of those past development efforts, as you can read about more in this exhaustive two-part feature. SPRINT together with HSVTOL underscores significant continued interest, especially within the Air Force special operations community, in new, more capable and survivable runway-independent platforms, especially to help get personnel in and out of denied or otherwise sensitive locales. The significant speed and range capabilities that both of those efforts are targeting could be particularly attractive for future operations across the broad expanses of the Pacific region. 'I think the high speed/range, high-speed kind of lower profile ability to get in and out of places that don't require long runways, I think that would be attractive to any combatant commander,' Air Force Lt. Gen. Michael Conley, head of Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), said in regards to SPRINT and HSVTOL at a media roundtable on the sidelines of the Air & Space Forces Association's (AFA) main annual conference last month. 'It's certainly a capability we need in the Indo-Pacific, just because of the geography, regardless of an [specific] adversary.' At the same time, it is not hard to see how the Air Force more broadly, as well as other branches of the U.S. military, might be interested in the kinds of capabilities that designs being developed under SPRINT and HSVTOL, or variants or derivatives thereof, might offer. The U.S. Marine Corps and the Air Force, especially, increasingly envision future operations, especially in the context of a high-end fight against a potential adversary like China, as dispersed affairs. Distributing forces across a large number of operating locations, including far-flung forward sites with limited infrastructure, is seen more and more as not only advantageous, but critical for reducing vulnerability. Large established bases will be prime targets in any future large-scale conflict.

Road operations are among the tactics seeing a resurgence within the U.S. military as part of broader efforts to reduce reliance on traditional runways. James Deboer A Marine F-35B sitting on a stretch of highway in California during a recent exercise. James Deboer In line with this, diverse and distributed logistics chains are also increasingly seen as essential for supporting these operations, especially in contested environments. A high-speed, long-range, runway-independent, and highly survivable cargo aircraft, crewed or uncrewed, could easily be a part of that future ecosystem. In fact, the Air Force Research Laboratory just put out a request for information (RFI) about potential Runway Independent Mobility / Next Generation Intra-theater Airlift (NGIA) aircraft last month. NGIA builds on an earlier concept dubbed Last Tactical Leg, according to Aviation Week, which was first to report on this development. 'The Last Tactical Leg proposal envisions an autonomous, hybrid-electric short- or vertical-takeoff-and-landing aircraft,' Aviation Week's story explains. 'This proposed airlifter would deliver small, urgently needed supplies from logistics hubs to forward bases, even with battle-damaged runways on both ends.' 'The Department of the Air Force’s (DAF’s) goal [with NGIA] is to enhance existing airlift capability and capacity with an intra-theater platform that can fight through damaged infrastructure on responsive timelines,' according to the RFI for that effort. AFRL is now 'seeking information on advanced configurations, propulsion and power generation/regulation concepts and technologies for a contested logistics aircraft with attributes for agility in the objective area, airlift capacity, speed, range and survivability to sustain joint force operations within the contested environment.' All of this sounds very much in line with Aurora's vision for scaled-up designs based on the SPRINT demonstrator. Bell has also previously laid out a concept for a scalable family of advanced tilt-rotor aircraft that is tied in with its SPRINT and HSVTOL work, and that you can read more about here. Bell previously teamed with Boeing to develop the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor, variants of which are in service with AFSOC, as well as with the Marines and U.S. Navy. A rendering Bell released in 2021 showing three tiers of HSVTOL concepts, including two crewed examples (at left and center) and a small uncrewed type (at right). Bell The Air Force and Marine Corps, as well as the U.S. Army, have already been exploring smaller uncrewed vertical takeoff and landing-capable drones to support logistics requirements and other mission sets. The Air Force has been experimenting with light fixed-wing aircraft converted into drones as small uncrewed airlifters, as well. It does still remains to be seen whether a working design of any kind emerges from SPRINT, HSVTOL, or NGIA. If one does, whether it actually enters operational service with the Air Force or any other branch of the U.S. military is also an open question. 'There's a lot of hard things,' AFOSC head Lt. Gen. Conley said at the AFA conference last month again while speaking about SPRINT and HSVTOL. 'Some of it's just the technological pieces of the engines and trying to get enough lift and enough size.' 'I think, conceptually as an Air Force, we struggle a little bit with how big is big enough &#8230; as you look at the developmental models, some of them are, you know, the size of a sedan. And then&#8230; another iteration would be the size of about a UH-60 [Black Hawk helicopter]. And then you get up to a little bigger &#8230; probably C-130 'lite,'' he continued. 'And I think as an Air Force that's used to move in a lot of big things, and a lot of people, and a lot of pallets, and big amounts of cargo, there's a little bit of a mental block there.' A C-130J Hercules, one of the main airlifters currently in U.S. military service. Lockheed Martin Conley's general sentiments here have been echoed by other Air Force officials in the past. 'There were … thousands, maybe, of C-47s, and they were all over the Pacific [during World War II],' Gen. Kenneth Wilsbach, then head of U.S. Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), said back in 2022. 'They weren’t fast, but they can carry a lot, and they tackled the logistics problem of the Pacific by having a lot of tails to … move equipment.' Although 'it got there at 120, maybe 150 knots … it worked,' he added. 'We could have something like that &#8230; where you don’t have to have it going 500 knots,' but the logistics effort wouldn’t 'eat a lot of tail numbers to be able to get the small bits of equipment and pieces to the various spots that we intend to deploy from.' 'Does it have to be manned? Can it be unmanned? Does it have to be 10,000 pounds or 5,000 pounds [payload capacity-wise]? Can I do vertical lift? Can I do it on an airship [or] a slow-moving low-altitude blimp?' now-retired Gen. Mike Minihan, then head of Air Mobility Command, asked rhetorically while speaking about future airlift requirements in an interview with Aviation Week last year. 'There’s a lot of opportunity when it comes to how you approach that.' It is worth remembering here that the Air Force did briefly operate a fleet of C-27J Spartan cargo aircraft between 2008 and 2013. Those aircraft had been acquired specifically to support intra-theater airlift requirements as part of what was originally a joint program with the Army. The Air Force ultimately curtailed those plans ostensibly due to budgetary limitations and divested all of its Spartans. Some of those C-27Js subsequently ended up in the Army's special operations aviation inventory. A C-27J Spartan assigned to US Army Special Operations Aviation Command. US Army SOCOM and AFSOC have clear interest currently in seeing SPRINT and HSVTOL through to the delivery of an operational capability. Aurora's latest renderings show how that work could further evolve into designs to support a wider array of mission sets.

Anduril’s Roadrunner Drone Hunting Drone Gets Expanded Order From...	Anduril's Roadrunner counter-drone interceptor drone just got a further stamp of approval from the Pentagon in the form of an order worth hundreds of millions of dollars to deliver additional units. This is a major win for Anduril, still a newcomer to the defense industry, whose rapidly growing product catalog largely aims at disrupting the existing marketplace. While some remain skeptical of the company's ambitious aspirations, continuing support from DoD is a signal that whatever they are doing is worth continued investment. You can read our deep dive on Roadrunner in our past feature linked here. Over 500 Roadrunner-Ms, as well as Pulsar electronic warfare systems, will be supplied as part of the nearly quarter-billion dollar deal, with deliveries beginning in 2024. Pulsar is a modular, AI-infused, networked, electronic warfare system that can be mounted on base stations, vehicles, and aircraft. The new order is roughly two and a half times the size of the DoD's past expenditures on both systems, which appears to have focused more on testing, demonstrations, and early integration work. The company's Lattice open architecture autonomy command and control software can be integrated with both systems. Anduril's AI-infused and networked Pulsar EW system comes in stationary, ground vehicle, and airborne offerings. This order shouldn't be too big of a surprise as the Pentagon continues to grapple with the rapidly expanding threat posed by lower-end drones and long-range one-way attack munitions. Roadrunner is vertically launched and recovered, and possesses a high degree of maneuverability thanks to its vectored thrust turbojets. It's optionally reusable. If one is launched and it is not needed to take down a threat, which could include drones, as well as cruise missiles and low-flying manned aircraft, it can be recovered and refueled for another mission. Depending on the configuration, it could also be used to surveil and strike targets on the ground or carry non-kinetic payloads. Roadrunners in 'Nest' launcher boxes can be distributed around a broad area to maximize response time and protection coverage. The idea is that Roadrunner can be launched on initial warning, or even preemptively, to get after a threat immediately without the possibility of wasting an effector in doing so if the intercept is not needed. Beyond defending troops and installations in forward locales, Roadrunner could be extremely useful aboard ships that have become top targets for drone attacks. We lay out this entire use case in great detail in this past feature. In a press release, Anduril says that 'Roadrunner has been operationally deployed for Combat Evaluation since January 2024 and Pulsar has been operationally deployed in multiple regions since August 2023.' In other words, Roadrunner and Pulsar have been used in the field, at least in an evaluative manner, which appears to have been a success. Similar kinetic counter-UAS systems, such as Raytheon's Coyote, as well as electronic warfare systems, have been put into operational use for years now, most notably at high-threat locations in the Middle East. Smaller past contracts related to Roadrunner and Pulsar likely involved more limited use case deployments that have subsequently led to this expanded buy. It is not chasing the same requirement as the Coyote Blk 2. There are two different programs, one that builds on the B-Blk2 on LIDS, and another that meets a SOCOM program need. Roadrunner has been shown as a SOCOM future need in DOD materials for several months now. pic.twitter.com/tkk0nP6YaA&mdash; AirPower 2.0 (MIL_STD) (@AirPowerNEW1) December 1, 2023 We reached out to Anduril regarding where their Roadrunner and Pulsar systems have been deployed and what type of action they have seen, but they could not provide any additional details at this time. What's clear is that the Pentagon thinks they are effective enough to want more of them. Considering how both of these capabilities would be critical to a future fight, especially a distributed one across the Pacific, if Roadrunner and Pulsar continue to prove their worth and evolve into even more potent weapons, these orders could quickly become exponentially larger.

Stealthy Uncrewed Combat Air Vehicle To Work Alongside Future Fre...	France has unveiled plans to develop a new uncrewed combat air vehicle (UCAV) that will complement the forthcoming Rafale F5 crewed fighter, as part of a new-look French Air and Space Force. The industrial side of the drone program will be headed up by Dassault Aviation, drawing upon its previous nEUROn UCAV demonstrator, which has already been used in trials with crewed combat aircraft. The program was announced today by France’s Minister of the Armed Forces Sébastien Lecornu, during a ceremony marking the 60th anniversary of the French Strategic Air Forces (FAS) at Saint-Dizier Air Base. Sur la base aérienne 113 de Saint-Dizier pour les 60 ans des Forces aériennes stratégiques, @SebLecornu annonce une évolution majeure pour la dissuasion nucléaire aéroportée française : le nouveau standard du Rafale, le F5, qui emportera le futur missile nucléaire ASN4G.Le… pic.twitter.com/WfuOi24PWO&mdash; Ministère des Armées et des Anciens combattants (@Armees_Gouv) October 8, 2024 'This stealth combat drone will contribute to the technological and operational superiority of the French Air Force by 2033,' explained Éric Trappier, chairman and CEO of Dassault, in a statement. 'It is significant that it is being initiated today, as we mark the 60th anniversary of the Strategic Air Forces and the 90th anniversary of the Air and Space Force: in aeronautics — a highly complex field — the future has deep roots, and innovation is built on experience. Dassault Aviation and its partners are proud to serve the French Armed Forces and the French Defense Procurement Agency (DGA).' France’s Minister of the Armed Forces Sébastien Lecornu, during the ceremony marking the 60th anniversary of the French Strategic Air Forces (FAS) at Saint-Dizier Air Base today. French Ministry of Defense Some details were provided about the capabilities of the new drone and the kinds of technologies it will incorporate. The drone — as yet unnamed — will be 'complementary to the Rafale and suited to collaborative combat.' It will also have stealth characteristics including an internal payload. The UCAV will feature autonomous control, with a human-in-the-loop (in this case, the pilot in the cockpit of the Rafale). A French Air and Space Force Rafale C. Dassault Aviation Dassault Aviation/Anthony Pecchi According to Dassault, the drone 'will be highly versatile and designed to evolve in line with future threats,' although no further information was provided about its expected performance or even the range of missions it will fly. It may or may not be relevant that a Dassault press release today refers to the new drone working alongside the Rafale F5 'like the Mirage IV … [to] ensure France’s independence and capability superiority in the coming decades.'

This would appear to be a specific reference to France’s airborne nuclear deterrent, a role undertaken by FAS using the Rafale. In the past, the mission was carried out by the Mirage IV. It may be that this is a reference to the drone supporting the Rafale on nuclear penetration missions, clearing the way for strikes, for example. On the other hand, it may simply be a more general reference based on the announcement being made at an FAS air base. As for the F5 Standard of the Rafale that the new drone will be expected to support, this is planned to keep the multirole combat aircraft in frontline service until around 2060. Initial studies for the F5 Standard were initiated last year, with full-scale development to begin in the 2026-27 timeframe. This means that the aircraft can be closely tailored to enable crewed-uncrewed teaming with the new drone. In the past, it’s been stated that the Rafale F5 would have a focus on collaborative combat, as well as incorporating new-generation weapons. These weapons are planned to include the ASN4G, the next-generation standoff nuclear weapon for the French Armed Forces, replacing the current ASMPA. ASMPA on a Rafale. MBDA Other new weapons for the Rafale F5 are expected to include successors for the SCALP conventional cruise missile and Exocet anti-ship missile, with a hypersonic design being examined for the latter requirement. Air-to-air munitions should include an upgraded Meteor beyond-visual-range missile. Suppression and destruction of enemy air defenses (SEAD/DEAD) is also seen as a primary mission for the Rafale F5 and one that would benefit hugely from a loyal-wingman-type drone to operate alongside the crewed fighter. Other efforts to enhance the survivability of the Rafale F5 may include conformal fuel tanks and radar-cross-section reduction kits, although the fighter will certainly not be truly stealthy, making a drone wingman all the more valuable. Since the Rafale F5 is being developed with the Future Combat Air System (FCAS) in mind, it’s very likely that the new drone will also be designed to operate within this broader architecture. Not to be confused with the U.K.-led effort of the same name, the pan-European FCAS will include uncrewed air vehicles as well as uncrewed effectors and remote weapon carriers, some of which can be air-launched and which will increasingly blur the distinction between cruise missiles and drones. The centerpiece of FCAS will eventually be a crewed combat aircraft, the Next Generation Fighter (NGF), which should eventually replace the Rafale, among others. An infographic describing the various components of Airbus’ FCAS concept, including the 'new fighter,' which is now known as the Next Generation Fighter. Airbus The Rafale is also available in a two-seat version, which would appear to lend itself especially well to the 'drone controller' role, potentially with a dedicated rear cockpit for teaming up with UCAVs. Similar concepts are also being explored in China and the U.S. Air Force has also eyed its two-seat F-15EX as a possible candidate for working with loyal wingman drones. While we don’t know what the new drone announced today will look like, nor do we have an idea of its size, it seems likely that it will at least be informed by the Dassault nEUROn, a UCAV demonstrator that you can read more about here. The stealthy nEUROn is a flying-wing-type drone, launched in 2003 as a pan-European project, but headed up by Dassault of France. The nEUROn was first flown in December 2012 and has so far conducted more than 170 test flights. nEUROn under construction. Dassault Aviation Sebastien Rande Notably, some of these tests have included determining the UCAV’s ability to remain undetected and penetrate air defense networks. In 2016, the drone was reportedly able to successfully breach the air defense perimeter around the French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle, a clear demonstration of its stealth characteristics. Today’s announcement might be bad news for Airbus, which unveiled its fighter-like stealthy Wingman uncrewed concept aircraft this summer. Also intended to fly collaborative missions alongside crewed fighters, the Wingman has been pitched as a low-cost solution — with a price tag equivalent to one-third that of a modern crewed fighter — that can be brought into production and fielded rapidly. The Airbus Wingman uncrewed concept aircraft, which broke cover earlier this year. Thomas Newdick Thomas Newdick In relation to Wingman, Airbus noted that the German Air Force had 'expressed a clear need' for a drone that would be able to operate in conjunction with crewed fighters before the arrival in service of the pan-European FCAS. With Airbus already playing a major role in FCAS, the company may have hoped that Wingman would also attract interest from other countries involved in that initiative: Belgium, France, and Spain. So far, there’s no sign that France is interested in Wingman, although it’s hard to envisage that Airbus could develop and build this UCAV solely to meet a German requirement for an uncrewed companion that can work alongside its forthcoming Eurofighter EK electronic warfare jets, which seem likely to be a major driver behind it. An artist’s concept of the Eurofighter EK electronic warfare aircraft for Germany. Like the Rafale F5, it’s intended to go to war accompanied by UCAVs. Airbus At the same time, Wingman is expected to enter service in the 2030s timeframe, at much the same time as the new Dassault UCAV. It’s certainly questionable whether the European defense industry can support two apparently overlapping if not competing, programs. Without any concept art or details of the design of the new Dassault UCAV, we can’t say for sure whether it will follow the pattern established by nEUROn, although that certainly seems possible if not probable. If this is indeed the case, the launch of this program again highlights an apparent gap in the U.S. combat aircraft space as well as the growing interest in stealthy UCAVs in other countries. For some time now, drones in this category have become attractive as a far more cost-effective and more capable alternative to crewed aircraft to satisfy a number of missions, especially the more hazardous ones. In particular, China has been pushing ahead with the development of UCAVs for exactly these reasons, with other programs being pursued in Russia and elsewhere. The news from France today suggests that the trend for UCAVs — flying wing or otherwise — is only likely to grow exponentially as time goes on.

Trophy Armored Vehicle Protection System Gains New Ability To Def...	Israeli defense contractor Rafael says it has developed a new version of its combat-proven Trophy active protection system (APS) that is better able to defeat top-down attacks. Increasing Trophy's ability to engage threats attacking from above could be particularly valuable for swatting down hostile drones, including highly maneuverable first-person view kamikaze (FPV) types and ones designed to drop small munitions straight down on their targets. The War Zone previously laid out a detailed case for how hard-kill APSs like Trophy could help give tanks and other armored vehicles a critical additional layer of protection against these threats, which the war in Ukraine has brought fully into the public view. Rafael publicly unveiled Trophy's new top-attack defense capability today, which can be seen demonstrated in the video below, including against a target drone. The video also includes multiple clips from the conflict in Ukraine, including one captured via the camera on an FPV drone right before it hits its mark, as well as various flash points in the Middle East. Trophy was first developed in the late 2000s and was originally primarily designed to defend against anti-tank guided missiles and other types of infantry anti-armor weapons like shoulder-fired rockets and rocket-propelled grenades. Trophy's existing core components are an array of small radars and launchers pre-loaded with ‘hard-kill’ projectiles. The radars detect incoming threats and cue the launchers, which then fire their projectiles. Though a small explosive charge is used to propel them, the projectiles themselves are kinetic, being designed to destroy, or at least disrupt, whatever they hit through sheer force of impact. 'Rafael officials unveiled the [top-attack defense] upgrade in a briefing here last week held ahead of the AUSA [Association of the U.S. Army] arms exhibition in Washington next week, where the company will exhibit its wares,' according to a report from Defense News. 'The company declined to specify how the upgrade works or when the capability was first introduced on Trophy, saying only the system had undergone numerous development cycles since first being fielded more than ten years ago.' The imagery Rafael has now released highlighting Trophy's new top-down defense capabilities does show pronounced explosive blasts. It is unclear whether this reflects the launch of additional kinetic interceptors, the use of an actual explosive charge to defeat incoming threats, and/or secondary explosions from successful interceptions. Regardless of how the improved system functions, it offers additional coverage against drones and other threats from above like anti-tank guided missiles with top-down attack capability.

Rafael capture The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) first began fielding Trophy on its Merkava tanks in 2009. The system, which is now in increasing service globally, including with the U.S. military, has since demonstrated its value in combat many times. The video below from fighting in the Gaza Strip in December 2023 offers a prime view of the system in action.

The system 'provides 360° protection in azimuth as well as extensive elevation coverage,' according to official marketing material. The potential vulnerabilities that the limits to Trophy's 'elevation coverage' present have come more into view since Hamas’ large-scale terrorist attacks on southern Israel on October 7, 2023. The Palestinian terrorist group used drones to drop small munitions on top of Israeli Merkava tanks and other vehicles, as well as static defenses. It is unclear whether or not the Trophys on the Merkavas were in operation at the time of those attacks, but they still prompted new discussions about the system's top-down defense deficiencies.

The Pentagon just recently announced that defeating drones, an area where the U.S. military continues to lag behind, will be the focus of a new Replicator 2 rapid fielding initiative. The original Replicator effort has been focused on getting uncrewed systems into the hands of American forces. The idea of using Trophy and other hard-kill APSs to provide an existing and relatively quick avenue for adding anti-drone defenses to tanks and other armored vehicles is also now new, as you can learn more about in detail in our past deep-drive on this exact topic. At the same time, it is important to note that APSs are not a silver bullet solution to drone threats, which look to be on the cusp of another major evolution, if not a revolution driven heavily by advances in artificial intelligence, the subject of another recent War Zone feature. Layered defenses, including other systems mounted on vehicles and ones otherwise deployed around the battlespace, will be key to meeting current and future counter-drone requirements. This will be especially true when it comes to defeating large-volume attacks, including ones involving networked swarms. A counter-drone ecosystem that includes high-power laser and microwave directed energy weapons, laser dazzlers, and electronic warfare jammers, as well as traditional guns and surface-to-air missiles, is already emerging. With all this in mind, Rafael's new top-down defense upgrade for Trophy is not only logical, but is likely a sign of things to come from other APS manufacturers as critical demand for new and improved ways to defend tanks and other armored vehicles against drones keeps growing.
